<text>Doab () is a term used in South Asia for the tract of land lying between two confluent rivers. It is similar to an interfluve. In the &quot;Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary&quot;, R. S. McGregor refers to its Persian origin in defining it as &quot;do-āb&quot; (, literally &quot;two [bodies of] water&quot;) &quot;a region lying between and reaching to the confluence of two rivers.&quot;

== Khadir, bangar, barani, nali and bagar==


Since North India and Pakistan are coursed by a multiplicity of Himalayan rivers that divide the plains into &quot;doabs&quot; (i.e. regions between two rivers), the Indo-Gangetic plains consist of alternating regions of river, &quot;khadir&quot; and &quot;bangar&quot;. The regions of the &quot;doabs&quot; near the rivers consist of low-lying, floodplains, but usually, very fertile &quot;khadir&quot; and the higher-lying land away from the rivers consist of &quot;bangar&quot;, less prone to flooding but also less fertile on average.

Khadir is also called nali or naili, specially in northern Haryana the fertile prairie tract between the Ghaggar river and the southern limits of the Saraswati channel depression in that gets flooded during the rains.

Within bangar area, the barani is any low rain area where the rain-fed dry farming is practiced, which nowadays are dependent on the tubewells for irrigation. Bagar tract, an example of barani land, is the dry sandy tract of land on the border of Rajasthan state adjoining the states of Haryana and Punjab. Nahri is any canal-irrigated land, for example, the &quot;Rangoi tract&quot; which is an area irrigated by the &quot;Rangoi channel/canal&quot; made for the purpose of carrying flood waters of Ghagghar river to dry areas.

Historically, villages in the &quot;doabs&quot; have been officially classified as &quot;khadir&quot;, &quot;khadir-bangar&quot; (i.e. mixed) or &quot;bangar&quot; for many centuries, and different agricultural tax rates applied based on a tiered land-productivity scale.

== The Doab==
&quot;The Doab&quot; designates the flat alluvial tract between the Ganges and Yamuna rivers extending from the Sivalik Hills to the two rivers&#x27; confluence at Prayagraj. It is also called as &quot;Ganges-Yamuna Doab&quot; or &quot;Ganga Doab&quot;. The region has an area of about 23,360 square miles (60,500 square km); it is approximately in length and in width.

The British raj divided the &quot;Doab&quot; into three administrative districts, viz., Upper Doab (Meerut), Middle Doab (Agra) and Lower Doab (Allahabad).

Currently the following states and districts form part of &quot;The Doab&quot;:

===Upper Doab===

==The Punjab Doabs==
Each of the tracts of land lying between the confluent rivers of the Punjab region of Pakistan and India has a distinct name, said to have been coined by Raja Todar Mal, a minister of the Mughal emperor Akbar. The names (except for &quot;Indus Sagar&quot;) are a combination of the first letters, in the Persian alphabet, of the names of the rivers that bound the Doab. For example, &quot;Chaj&quot; () = Chanāb (, &quot;Chenab&quot;) + &quot;Jehlam&quot; (, &quot;Jhelum&quot;). The names are from east to west.

===Indus Sagar Doab===

The Indus Sagar Doab lies between the Indus and Jhelum rivers.

===Chaj Doabs===

The Chaj Doab lies between the Jhelum and the Chenab rivers.

===Rachna Doabs===

The Rachna Doab (considerable portion of the Rechna Doab is Majha) lies between the Chenab and the Ravi rivers.

===Bari Doabs===

The Bari Doab (considerable portion of the Bari Doab is Majha) lies between the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers.

===Bist Doab===

The Bist Doab (or Doaba) - between the Beas and the Sutlej rivers.

==Other doabs==

<text>Robert Louis Krulwich (born August 5, 1947) is an American radio and television journalist who co-hosted the radio show &quot;Radiolab&quot; and served as a science correspondent for NPR. He has reported for ABC, CBS, and Pacifica, with assignment pieces for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, as well as PBS&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot;, &quot;NOVA&quot;, and &quot;NOW with Bill Moyers&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; called him &quot;the most inventive network reporter in television&quot;, and &quot;New York Magazine&quot; wrote that he&#x27;s &quot;the man who simplifies without being simple.&quot;

==Background==
Krulwich received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in U.S. history from Oberlin College in 1969 and his Juris Doctor degree from Columbia Law School in 1974. Just two months later, he abandoned his pursuit of a law career to cover the Watergate hearings for Pacifica Radio. In 1976, he became Washington bureau chief for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

From 1978 to 1985, he was the business and economics correspondent for NPR. Among other creative efforts, he recorded an opera called &quot;Rato Interesso&quot; to explain interest rates. He went on to host the PBS arts series &quot;Edge&quot;.

In 1984, he joined CBS and appeared regularly on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, &quot;48 Hours&quot;, and &quot;Nightwatch with Charlie Rose&quot;. During the Gulf War, he co-anchored the CBS program &quot;America Tonight&quot;. In 1994, he joined ABC.

In 1992, Krulwich appeared as a guest on the first episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Critic Tom Shales panned Krulwich&#x27;s appearance, describing him as &quot;the Big Bird of economics.&quot;

Annually through the 1990s, he hosted a semi-fictional year-in-review program called &quot;Backfire&quot; for NPR. In 1995, at the invitation of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, Krulwich recorded a live show at the White House with the rest of the “Backfire” team.

In 1999, he hosted an eight-part prime-time series for ABC &quot;Nightline&quot; called &quot;Brave New World&quot; (which frequently featured his friends, They Might Be Giants, as musical guests).

In 2004, Krulwich became the host and managing editor of the innovative PBS science program &quot;NOVA scienceNOW&quot;. The show often tackled science stories considered too complex for television, sometimes using cartoons and musical production numbers to illustrate abstract concepts. In 2005, Krulwich re-established a relationship with NPR, where he made regular contributions to several programs on science topics, while continuing to produce occasional segments for ABC News. By early 2006, with several projects going at once, Krulwich decided to end his work on &quot;NOVA scienceNOW&quot; after only five episodes.

Krulwich regularly moderates discussions on scientific topics at the 92nd Street Y in New York City. His presentations at the YMHA have featured such prominent scientists as Brian Greene and James D. Watson.

He is a regular correspondent on the PBS investigative series &quot;Frontline&quot;. Krulwich substitutes for the hosts of NPR&#x27;s magazine shows, and from mid-2004 to January 2020 he co-hosted the &quot;Radiolab&quot; program with Jad Abumrad.

Krulwich has a prominent role in the 2021 feature documentary film &quot;Objects&quot; as a proponent of recognizing the importance of seemingly useless keepsakes for their history and personal meaning.

== Retirement ==
On December 5, 2019, Krulwich announced via the &quot;Radiolab&quot; email newsletter that he would be retiring from &quot;Radiolab&quot;, though specifying it would not be immediate. His last episode aired on January 30, 2020. Krulwich said he planned to use his retirement to work on collaborations including a documentary about Oliver Sacks with Ric Burns and a project about photographer Anand Varma&#x27;s cultivation of jellyfish.

==Awards and honors==
In his &quot;Frontline&quot; role, he has won an Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award for his coverage of campaign finance in the 1992 U.S. Presidential campaign; a national Emmy Award for his investigation of privacy on the Internet, &quot;High Stakes in Cyberspace&quot;; and a George Polk Award for an hour on the savings and loan scandal. His ABC special on Barbie also won an Emmy.

He has received a multitude of other awards for his reporting, including the Extraordinary Communicator Award from the National Cancer Institute in 2000, four consecutive Gainsbrugh Awards from the Economics Broadcasting Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science Excellence in Television Award in 2001 for a &quot;NOVA&quot; special on the human genome. He also won the 2001 AAAS Science Journalism Award for his &quot;NOVA&quot; special, &quot;Cracking the Code of Life&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; named Krulwich to its &quot;all-star reporting team.&quot; He was included in &quot;Esquire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Registry of Outstanding Men and Women&quot; in 1989.

In 2010, WNYC received a Peabody Award for &quot;Radiolab&quot;.

==Personal life==
Krulwich lives in New York City and Shelter Island, New York, with his wife, Tamar Lewin, a national reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. They have two children: Jesse (who graduated from Earlham College in 2007), and Nora Ann (Bowdoin College, Class of 2011). The couple was featured in Act 2 of Episode 226 (&quot;Reruns&quot;) of the Chicago Public Radio program &quot;This American Life&quot;, recounting their separate (and divergent) accounts of an event in their lives.

Krulwich is an improvisational comedian who performed with his troupe at the White House in 1995.

<doc id="913993" wikidata="Q1418631" url="?curid=913993" title="Girolamo Rainaldi">
<text>Girolamo Rainaldi (4 May 1570 – 15 July 1655) was an Italian architect who worked mainly in a conservative Mannerist style, often with collaborating architects. He was a successful competitor of Bernini. His son, Carlo Rainaldi, became an even more notable, more fully Baroque architect.

== Biography ==
The son of a painter from Norcia, Rainaldi was born in Rome.

He trained with the architect-engineer Domenico Fontana and collaborated as a junior partner with Giacomo Della Porta, whom he succeeded as the papacy&#x27;s chief architect, as &quot;officium architecti nobilis fabricae Capitolii Populi Romani&quot;. He completed too Palazzo Albertoni Spinola projected from Giacomo Della Porta. He was constantly at work on lesser projects such as altars and church furnishings, and with on-going projects of other designers, especially at St Peter&#x27;s and in completing Michelangelo&#x27;s project at the Campidoglio with the Palazzo Nuovo discreetly designed to mirror Michelangelo&#x27;s masterful Palazzo dei Conservatori.

Rainaldi&#x27;s most influential single design was the façade of the Chiesa di Gesù e Maria; the project began in 1642, and was not completed before Rainaldi&#x27;s death. In his official capacity Rainaldi also designed the palazzo to house the Jesuits in the Piazza del Gesù, a Mannerist façade without a trace of Baroque in its details. As the favored architect of Cardinal Pamphili, he temporarily eclipsed Bernini when this cardinal became Pope as Innocent X in 1644 and he became Papal architect of Rome in 1644.

The elder Rainaldi&#x27;s important projects in Rome the Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona (c. 1645 – 1650), where he designed the ground plan of Sant&#x27;Agnese and laid its foundations beginning in 1652, but was replaced the following year by Francesco Borromini, who erected quite a different façade on Rainaldi&#x27;s foundations; after Rainaldi&#x27;s death his son Carlo was called in to replace Borromini.

He also designed the Tombs in Santa Cecilia in Trastevere and collaborated in the baroque setting of the gardens of Villa Borghese. In Rome, he was appointed Prince of the Academy of St. Luke for the year 1641.

The elder Rainaldi was all but house architect for the Farnese family. In the Farnese stronghold of Caprarola, near Rome, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese commissioned Rainaldi to build for the Discalced Carmelites the Church of SS Maria e Silvestro (1621–23), a beautiful and original church adapted to exigencies of the site. Cardinal Odoardo also commissioned the enriched interior of Santa Maria della Consolazione at Caprarola (that is similar to Santa Maria in Campitelli, projected later from his son Carlo Rainaldi). Rainaldi, who had adapted for the Farnese two monumental antique granite basins as matching fountains in Piazza Farnese in 1626, was taken to Parma by the Farnese to build their town palaces there, and also did the vaulting of &quot;Santissima Annunziata&quot; in that city.

Rainaldi was also active in Bologna, where he designed the vaulting to cover the vast and ambitious church of San Petronio (finished on-site by Francesco Martini), and designed the Church of Santa Lucia (1623). For Francesco d&#x27;Este, who, with the loss of the Este seat of Ferrara to the Papal States, concentrated his patronage in his Duchy of Modena, Rainaldi contributed to the construction of the Ducal Palace to supplant the ancient &quot;castello&quot;, and was in particular charged with the layout and elaborate hydraulics of its gardens, with &quot;giochi di acque&quot; and a theater clipped in green hedges, 1631-34 (Roganti).

Girolamo Rainaldi is modestly buried next to his father in the Church of Santi Luca e Martina; designed in part by Rainaldi&#x27;s father, and part by Pietro da Cortona.

<doc id="913995" wikidata="Q4989673" url="?curid=913995" title="Olivia Serres">
<text>Olivia Serres (3 April 1772 – 21 November 1834), known as Olive, was a British painter and writer, born in Warwick. She is also known as an English impostor who claimed the title of Princess Olive of Cumberland.

==Origins and early career==
Olive was born Olivia Wilmot, the daughter of Robert Wilmot, a house painter, in Warwick. At the age of ten she was sent to board with her uncle, James Wilmot, rector of Barton-on-the-Heath. In 1789, she rejoined her father in London. She had a talent for painting and studied art with John Thomas Serres, (1759–1825), marine painter to George III, and she married Serres in 1791. They had two daughters. Olive exhibited her paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, but was financially reckless; both she and her husband were imprisoned for debt. The Serres came to a parting of the ways, with acrimony on both sides: from Serres because Olive had had several affairs when he was away, and from Olive because she was given an allowance of only £200 per annum. George Fields, an artist friend, moved in with Olive and she gave birth to his son prior to her divorce in 1804. She then devoted herself to painting and literature, producing a novel, some poems and a memoir of her uncle, the Rev. Dr Wilmot, in which she endeavoured to prove that he was the author of the &quot;Letters of Junius&quot;.
==Claims to royalty==
In 1817, Olive wrote a letter to the Prince Regent, claiming that she was the natural daughter of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland by Mrs. Olive Payne (who was James Wilmot&#x27;s sister and her actual aunt). She asked the prince for financial support. In a petition to George III, she put forward a claim to be the natural daughter of the Duke of Cumberland, the king&#x27;s brother.

In 1820, after her father, her uncle, and King George III had died, she revised her story. James Wilmot, she claimed, had secretly married the princess Poniatowski, sister of King Stanislaus II of Poland, and their daughter had married the Duke of Cumberland in 1767 at the London house of a nobleman. Olive claimed to be the only child of this marriage, and that her mother had died &quot;of a broken heart&quot; on the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s &quot;second&quot; and &quot;bigamous&quot; marriage to Anne Horton.

She herself, ten days after her birth, was, she alleged, taken from her mother, and substituted for the still-born child of Robert Wilmot. According to Olive Serres, King George III had learned the truth and had given her £5000 in cash and a yearly pension of £500 for life. She also claimed to have received support from the king of Poland and to have been created the Duchess of Lancaster by George III in May 1773, which, she said, entitled her to the income of the Duchy of Lancaster. In a memorial to George IV, she assumed the title of Princess Olive of Cumberland, placed the royal arms on her carriage and dressed her servants in the royal liveries.

==Defending her claims==
Olivia Serres&#x27;s claim was supported by documents, and she bore sufficient resemblance to her alleged father to be able to impose on numerous gullible people. In 1821, she had herself rebaptized as the daughter of the Duke of Cumberland at Islington Church, and &quot;announced&quot; her parentage in several letters to the newspapers and in pamphlets. She actually succeeded in obtaining some courtesies in response to her claims of royal status, such as being permitted to pass through the Constitution Gate.

The same year, however, she was arrested again for debt and placed in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison. She appealed to the public for contributions, placing posters reading &quot;The Princess of Cumberland in Captivity!&quot; all over London, and publishing, in 1822, further details of her claims. On her release, she had an affair with Sheriff J. W. Parkins, a London eccentric, who turned against her when she failed to honour her debts to him. She next had an affair with a young man who called himself William Henry FitzClarence, who claimed to be an illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence.

Olive managed to persuade Sir Gerard Noel, a member of Parliament, to make inquiry into her claims, but by this time the royal family was fighting back. They located her birth certificate, and obtained a statement by Robert Wilmot stating that he was her natural and lawful father, and a statement from Princess Poniatowski that none of King Stanislaus&#x27;s sisters had ever been to England. In 1823, Sir Robert Peel, then Home Secretary, speaking in Parliament, responded to Noel&#x27;s speech in Olive&#x27;s favour with a denunciation of her documents as forgeries and her story as a fabrication. It was concluded that her claims were false, but Olive escaped prosecution for forgery.

Her husband, who had never given her pretensions any support, expressly denied his belief in them in his will. Olive continued to have money problems and was for the rest of her life in and out of debtors&#x27; prisons. In 1830, she again published a pamphlet staking a claim on royalty.

==Suppressed book==
Serres became friendly with Lady Anne Hamilton, who had been lady-in-waiting to Queen Caroline, and gained her confidence. In 1832 Lady Anne wrote a history called &quot;The Authentic Records of the Court of England for the Last Seventy Years&quot;, which contained many accusations of scandals. The publisher, J. Phillips, was prosecuted and convicted but fled into exile. Serres has been identified as the author of an expanded version of the text which included more scandals, from financial malpractice up to murder; the resulting book was published in two volumes under the title &quot;The Secret History of the Court of England&quot;, but still claiming that Lady Anne Hamilton was the author. For her part, Lady Anne disclaimed any connection with the two volume publication. &quot;The Secret History of the Court of England&quot; was suppressed in the United Kingdom, a fact noted when it was much reprinted in the United States.

Serres died on 21 November 1834 leaving two daughters.

==Elder daughter==
Her elder daughter married Antony Ryves, a portrait painter. She upheld her mother&#x27;s claims and styled herself Princess Lavinia of Cumberland. In 1866 she took her case into court, producing all the documents on which her mother had relied, but the jury, without waiting to hear the conclusion of the reply for the crown, unanimously declared the signatures to be forgeries.

==Analysis==
Serres&#x27; pretensions have been called the result of an absurd vanity. Between 1807 and 1815 she had made the acquaintance of some members of the royal family. From this time onward, she is claimed to have been obsessed with the idea of raising herself, at all costs, to their social level. The tale once invented, she brooded so continuously over it that she may have ended by believing it herself.

<doc id="913997" wikidata="Q5158955" url="?curid=913997" title="Concordia College (New York)">
<text>Concordia College (CCNY) was a private college in Bronxville, New York, United States. It was sponsored by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and was a member of the Concordia University System. It was chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York to offer associate, bachelor, and master&#x27;s degrees.

Concordia, founded in 1881 as Concordia Progymnasium, received its original charter from the State Regents in 1936. From 1918 to 1969, it was named Concordia Collegiate Institute; in 1969, the preparatory school was closed and the present name of the college was authorized by a charter change. In 1972, the State Regents authorized the college to grant the baccalaureate degree. In 2011, the State Regents authorized the college to grant the master&#x27;s degree.

On January 28, 2021, Concordia announced that it would cease offering classes as of the Fall 2021 semester and that Iona College would purchase the Bronxville campus and provide a &quot;teach-out&quot; for current students. A parade of graduates was held on May 8, 2021, to mark the final May commencement. Classes ceased being offered by the college in August 2021, with a final conferral of degrees in December 2021.

==History==

Concordia College was founded in 1881 in Manhattan as a part of the Lutheran Church of St. Matthew in Manhattan. It was established as a feeder school for Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. Edmund Bohm and J.H. Sieker (director and pastor, respectively, of the Lutheran Church of St. Matthew) established a Sexta and a Quinta (the equivalent to the first two years of high school) at St. Mathew Academy and thereby in effect began a Progymnasium.

Concordia soon outgrew its modest beginning, and by February 1893, land had been purchased in Unionville, New York (now Hawthorne) for $9,000 donated by M. S. Becker. A sub-committee was elected to locate land outside of New York City. Pastor Edmund Bohm, William Dick, and Henry Fischer took a train to the Unionville Station in Westchester County. Property was selected based on the persuasiveness of a real estate agent and a local farmer who claimed that oats, corn, vegetables, and hay could be harvested from the land and that the property contained enough stones to build a foundation.

After great consideration (and myriad maintenance issues) the college was moved once again to its current home in Bronxville. were bought for $52,383 on April 23, 1908. The Bronxville property, like the Hawthorne campus, was chosen for its close proximity to Manhattan and for its bucolic backdrop. Three buildings—Feth Hall, Bohm Hall, and the Commons—were designed by Edward Lippincott Tilton and constructed in eight months for $160,000, which included furnishings and landscaping. On January 4, 1910, the Bronxville campus opened with a student body of 100 young men.

On June 28, 2019, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education placed Concordia&#x27;s accreditation on probation due to issues of assessment and financial stability. Despite efforts to improve its finances, Concordia announced on January 28, 2021, that it would cease classes starting with the Fall 2021 semester. The announcement noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated the decline in the college&#x27;s financial position.

The Roman Catholic Iona College in nearby New Rochelle reached an agreement with Concordia in May 2021 to purchase Concordia&#x27;s Bronxville campus and provide a &#x27;teach-out&#x27; for Concordia&#x27;s current students. The former Concordia Campus was subsequently used to house the new &quot;NewYork-Presbyterian Iona School of Health Sciences&quot;, established after a $20 million gift from NewYork-Presbyterian.

==Scheele Memorial Library==

The Scheele Memorial Library was dedicated on June 9, 1974, and honors the parents of Joan Scheele Mueller. Her father (business executive William Scheele) and mother were longtime members of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Brooklyn, New York.
The Concordia College Archives preserves historical records of the college. The archives document the college, beginning at its first location in Manhattan, the move to Hawthorne, as well as the purchase of the present site and all its additions in Bronxville. The collection includes documents, office files, scrapbooks, newspaper clippings, photographs, college publications, musical recordings, audio visual materials and artifacts.

==Academics==

Concordia offered the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees. The college also offered (on campus and online) the Master of Science in Childhood Special Education, Early Childhood Special Education, Business Leadership, a post-baccalaureate Nursing program, an R.N. to B.S. program, and accelerated associate and bachelor&#x27;s degree completion programs for adults.

=== Nursing program ===

Concordia College offered three nursing programs: the Traditional Undergraduate program, the Post-Baccalaureate program, and a RN to BS program.

The Traditional Undergraduate program was designed for first-year and transfer students and provided courses for traditional undergraduate students who seek a Bachelor of Science degree. The Post-Baccalaureate program was an accelerated, 15-month Bachelor of Science program for students with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in another field. The RN to BS program was designed for Registered Nurses who seek a bachelor&#x27;s degree to advance their careers.

In 2018, Concordia College&#x27;s nursing students had an 94.8% pass rate for first-time RN NCLEX test-takers.

==Students and faculty==

Concordia&#x27;s students came from 23 states and more than 37 countries worldwide. The student-to-professor ratio was 13 to 1. Total enrollment was 1,037 students before of its closing in 2021. 93% of the college&#x27;s students received some form of financial aid, whether grants or loans, and approximately 60% of Concordia&#x27;s students lived on campus.

==Athletics==
At the time of the school&#x27;s closing, Concordia–New York (CCNY) athletic teams were the Clippers. The college was a long-time competitor in the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing as a member of the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference (CACC) from 2009–10 to 2020–21. The Clippers previously competed in the East Coast Conference (ECC; originally known as the New York Collegiate Athletic Conference (NYCAC) until after the 2005–06 academic year) from 1989–90 to 2008–09.

Concordia–New York (CCNY) sponsored 12 varsity intercollegiate teams as of the 2018–19 school year: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and tennis; women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

===Facilities===


The Meyer Athletic Center&#x27;s 700-seat gymnasium was home to the Concordia College men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams and volleyball team. It also housed the Department of Athletics offices, as well as the athletic training room, locker rooms for both men and women, and a fitness center. Also in the complex were the Clipper Baseball Field, Clipper Softball Field, and the Clipper Soccer Field.

==Concordia Conservatory==

Concordia Conservatory was a center for music education in Westchester County. The Conservatory attempts to integrate music into the cultural life of the lower Westchester community. In addition to grassroots programs in schools, libraries, assisted living, and day care centers, the Conservatory offers performances. More than 150 performances are given each year including: Music-on-Parade for Scholarship, the Hoch Chamber Music Series, the Chamber Music Festival, and faculty concerts.

Despite the college closing, Concordia Conservatory continued as an independent organization, though moving to nearby Stamford, Connecticut.

==Donald A. Krenz Academic Center==
The Krenz Center addition to the Scheele Memorial Library&#x27;s second floor, completed in August 2006, contained classrooms, including the 82-seat Pietruski Auditorium, a 20-station computer teaching room, the Darlene Hedin Krenz Center for New Media and Digital Production, The Yeager Collection, and the OSilas Art Gallery. It was named after Donald Krenz who was chairman of Concordia College&#x27;s 13-member Board of Regents, a New York City lawyer, and businessman.

The center was selected for the 2009 American School and University Magazine Education Interiors Showcase. The project was chosen &quot;for its ability to integrate current and future technology, innovative use of materials, life-cycle cost versus first cost, timelessness, safety and security, clarity of design concept, and accommodation of an enhanced educational mission.&quot;

The Yeager Collection is a collection of autographs of American businessmen, financiers, and wealth creators. It is underwritten by George and Barbara Yeager.

The OSilas Gallery (underwritten by Si and Vicki Ford) opened on September 14, 2006. The gallery provided exhibitions, lectures, workshops, and art tours featuring a variety of art genres and styles, such as historic, contemporary, and new media. Many of these events were integrated with art and other academic programs at the college; an exhibition of Concordia student art was held annually.
==Schoenfeld Building==
In 1926, the college&#x27;s Board of Control unsuccessfully petitioned the LCMS to build a campus gym. Subsequently, the Schoenfeld Memorial Campaign committee was formed and set out to raise $100,000 for construction costs. The Schoenfeld Gymnasium was ultimately erected by the efforts of both the church congregation and The Lutheran Education Society. The gym opened on October 1, 1928. The final cost for the construction project was $140,000. The gymnasium was originally designed by American architect: James Gamble Rogers.

The gym was dedicated to William F. Schoenfeld, &quot;one of the foremost Lutheran ministers in New York&quot;. Among many accomplishments associated with the Lutheran Church, Schoenfeld was pastor for 21 years of the Immanuel Church in Manhattan and one of the founders of the Lutheran Education Society. He &quot;died suddenly July 30 [1919], on Buck Mountain, near Lake George, N.Y&quot;.

In 1994, three million dollars was raised to convert the Schoenfeld building into a drama facility and center for student life. On September 30, 1995, the building was re-opened to the college community.

On October 30, 2015, the new Schoenfeld Campus Center opened. The new modifications included a food court, expanded seating area, an enhanced game room, a redesigned campus store, new study lounges, and a redesigned garden in the outdoor courtyard.

<doc id="913998" wikidata="Q2840279" url="?curid=913998" title="Alta Ski Area">
<text>Alta is a ski area in the western United States, located in the town of Alta in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, in Salt Lake County. With a skiable area of , Alta&#x27;s base elevation is and rises to for a vertical gain of . One of the oldest ski resorts in the country, it opened its first lift in early 1939. Alta is known for receiving more snow than most Utah resorts, with an average annual snowfall of . It is also regularly ranked as having the best snow in North America. Alta is one of three remaining ski resorts in the U.S. that prohibit snowboarders, along with nearby competitor Deer Valley and Vermont&#x27;s Mad River Glen.

==History==

===Early history===
Alta is one of the oldest ski areas in the U.S. and is one of just three ski areas in the U.S. that prohibit snowboarders. Located at the head of Little Cottonwood Canyon in Albion Basin and Collins Gulch, barely from the Great Salt Lake, Alta resides in a unique micro climate characterized by over of high volume, low moisture snowfall annually.

Alta Ski Area features long, straight, fall-line pitches. Among the most well known are Alf&#x27;s High Rustler, Eddie&#x27;s High Nowhere, Stone Crusher and the Baldy Chutes. Though widely respected as one of the most challenging in-bounds ski areas in the world, Alta has always viewed itself as a local&#x27;s and family oriented ski area.

The community of Alta was established in 1871 as an offshoot of the silver mining operations in Little Cottonwood Canyon. A fire destroyed most of the town in 1878, then a cataclysmic avalanche in 1885—combined with the decline of mining—heralded a period of dormancy for the town. The area experienced a modest resurgence in mining in the 1900s, but the town declined again shortly thereafter, and was deserted with the exception of a few hardy miners who continued to intermittently prospect the area.

In 1935 the U.S. Forest Service retained the noted skier Alf Engen to hike into the area and determine its potential as a future ski area. Engen&#x27;s reports expressed great promise for the area, and recommended the purchase of additional surrounding lands to form the ski area. In 1937 a prominent Salt Lake City lawyer, Joe Quinney, along with other local businessmen, formed the Utah Winter Sports Association to oversee the development of skiing at Alta. In the following year construction began on the original Collins chairlift, fashioned from a surplus mining ore tramway system that featured a clamp-cam bullwheel gripping a metal cable strung with single-seat chairs. It was the second such chairlift in the United States, after Sun Valley. Alta opened to skiers for the first time in 1939 on January 15, offering a single ride on the chair for 25 cents.

===Recent Developments===
Alta installed its first triple in 1991, by upgrading the Germania double chair. The resort began adding a developed snowmaking infrastructure in 1996, and the ski area continues to develop and refine the process. The late 1990s and early 2000s were marked by further modernization. In 1999 the Sunnyside lift was replaced with a detachable triple chair, the resort&#x27;s first detachable chairlift. Two years later the Supreme chair was upgraded to a triple, and the Sugarloaf chair was replaced with a detachable quad. In the summer of 2004, the Collins double lift and Germania triple lifts were replaced with a single two-stage detachable quad going from the base of the former Collins lift to the top terminal of the former Germania lift. During the 2007–08 season, Alta introduced a new Axess RFID electronic lift ticket system, similar to that of the Solitude Ski Resort. During the 2008–09 season, Alta added a conveyor system at the start point of the Supreme lift that assists skiers in loading. Alta added safety bars to Sunnyside in 2010 and to Collins, Sugarloaf, and Supreme in the summer of 2011. For the 2017–18 season, Leitner-Poma built a high speed quad that replaced the former Supreme and Cecret lifts, extending from the Sugarloaf base area to the top terminal of the former Supreme lift. For the 2022-23 season, Leitner-Poma constructed a high speed six pack to replace the Sunnyside and Albion lifts.

=== Future Developments ===
The ski area is in the process of planning for the next several years. Proposed developments include a tram to the top of Mt. Baldy, a lift from the Sugar Bowl to Sugarloaf Pass, and improvements to parking.

On January 15, 2014, a group called Wasatch Equality and four individual snowboarders filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Alta Ski Area and the United States Forest Service, seeking to permanently disallow Alta from enforcing its anti-snowboarder policy and snowboarding ban. Alta Ski Area prevailed in the ruling and continues to exclusively serve skiers.

== Climate ==
Sugarloaf Mountain (Utah), , is a high peak within the Alta Ski Area. Sugarloaf Mountain has a subalpine climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), bordering on an Alpine climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). There is no weather station at the summit, but this climate table contains interpolated data for an area around the summit.

The ski area is owned by multiple individuals, with the largest shares being held by the Laughlin family (51%), the Quinney family (25%), and the Bass family (11%). The hotels at the base are all independently owned and not a part of Alta.

=== Partnership with Snowbird ===
Beginning in the winter of 2002, Alta and its neighbor, Snowbird, began offering a joint day pass and a joint season ticket, allowing skiers to fully access all of the terrain of both resorts. The offer coincided with the opening of a new lift in Mineral Basin, a large bowl owned by Snowbird on the back of Snowbird&#x27;s Hidden Peak and Alta&#x27;s Sugarloaf mountains, that allowed access to Alta. Other access points between the two resorts exist as well. (Due to Alta&#x27;s skiers-only policy, the offer is not open to snowboarders.)

===Lifts===
Alta currently has eight lifts. Three are located in Albion Basin, two are located in Collins Gulch, one transfers skiers between the two base areas, and the remaining two access hotels.

<text>Kristine Esebua (; born 19 March 1985, Khobi) is an archer from the nation of Georgia who now represents Canada. She has competed at four Olympic Games in archery.

In 2019, Esebua was forced to leave Georgia and moved to Toronto, Canada.

==Career==
===Georgia===
;2004 Summer Olympics
Esebua represented Georgia at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She placed 22nd in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 636.

;2008 Summer Olympics
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Esebua finished her ranking round with a total of 643 points. This gave her the 17th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Yuki Hayashi in the first round. Both archers scored 102 points in the regular match and a decisive extra round had to make the difference. In this extra round Esebua scored nine points and Hayashi eight, giving Esebua the ticket to the second round. There she hit another 102 points, but her opponent Elpida Romantzi did the same and yet again the match had to be decided with an extra round. This time it was Romantzi who advanced to the next round as she hit ten points against nine of Esebua who was eliminated.

<text>George Washington Custis Lee (September 16, 1832 – February 18, 1913), also known as Custis Lee, was the eldest son of Robert E. Lee and Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee. His grandfather, George Washington Parke Custis was the grandson of Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (the wife of George Washington). He served as a Confederate general in the U.S. Civil War, primarily as an aide-de-camp to President Jefferson Davis, and succeeded his father as president of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.

== Early life ==
George Washington Custis Lee was born in Fort Monroe, Virginia. He was educated at numerous boarding schools to prepare him in his father&#x27;s footsteps. He was educated at the classical school of Reverend George A. Smith in his younger years. He then entered the mathematical school of Benjamin Hallowell. When Lee was not admitted to West Point at age 16, his father, Robert E. Lee, sent a letter to General Winfield Scott on his son&#x27;s behalf, which precipitated a nomination from Zachary Taylor. Lee was then accepted to West Point at 17.

== West Point and U.S. Army ==
From 1850 to 1854, Lee attended West Point. During his first year, Lee excelled both academically and militarily. Toward the end of his first year he was almost expelled, when alcohol was found in his room. He claimed that he did not put it there, and got away with only minor punishments. He did well in his second year also. At the beginning of his third year, his father became the Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. Lee graduated first in his class of forty-six, in 1854. Other members of his class included J.E.B. Stuart, William Dorsey Pender, Oliver Otis Howard, John Pegram, James Deshler, Horace Randal, and John Villepigue.

Custis Lee was then commissioned in the Corps of Engineers, as his father before him. He was given the rank of brevet second lieutenant. He served primarily in California, Georgia, and Florida during his time in the United States Army. In 1855, he was given the rank of second lieutenant in the Regular Army. In 1859, Lee was commissioned a first lieutenant. Lee was then stationed in Washington D.C., during the period of secession and Fort Sumter. He then resigned from the Army, in the spring of 1861 after Virginia seceded from the Union. He resigned about two weeks after his father had done the same. Lee then offered his services to his father&#x27;s Virginia state forces.

== American Civil War ==

Custis Lee served in the Virginia state forces, until July 1861. At that time he was given a commission as a captain in the Confederate States Army. During the next few months, Lee worked in the Confederate Engineers. He spent his time constructing fortifications for the new capital city, Richmond. At the end of August 1861, Lee was offered and accepted the position of aide-de-camp to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He was then promoted to the rank of colonel. Lee served in his position for the next three years of the war. He was often sent on missions to assess the military, and would then return to report to Davis. When Robert E. Lee became the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, Custis Lee had constant contact with his father. In 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign, Custis Lee was put in charge of supervising the engineers at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff.

In June 1863, he was promoted to brigadier general. Lee was discouraged from taking a field command by Davis, but encouraged by his father. Lee asked his father for a field command, but his father replied that his highest duty was obedience to his superiors. For the most part, he obeyed Davis, but during the Battle of Gettysburg, Custis Lee was given the command of the troops in Richmond. In 1864, Custis Lee was placed in command of Richmond&#x27;s local defenses against General Grant and General Benjamin Butler. He did so well that he was given command of Richmond&#x27;s eastern defenses at Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. Lee remained at Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff throughout the next months, and in 1864, he was promoted to major general. Shortly before the end of the war, he commanded troops in the field and was captured at Sayler&#x27;s Creek by David Dunnels White a private in the 37th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment on April 6; three days before his father surrendered on Palm Sunday April 9, 1865, to Lieutenant-General Ulysses S. Grant at the McLean House in the village of Appomattox Court House, Virginia (see: Appomattox Court House National Historical Park).

== Later life ==

In late 1865, Lee was hired as a professor at the Virginia Military Institute. Lee held this position until the death of his father. Between 1871 and 1897, Lee served as the ninth president of Washington and Lee University. In 1877, seven years after his father&#x27;s death, Custis Lee sued in a case with assistance from Robert Lincoln that went all the way to the United States Supreme Court to regain title to the family mansion, Arlington House and plantation, which had become Arlington National Cemetery. Lee&#x27;s case, &quot;United States v. Lee&quot; (106 U.S. 196), was decided in his favor by a 5–4 vote, in 1882. Lee won both the house and the surrounding the mansion, but was less interested in retaining the estate than gaining a cash compensation for its value. In 1883, Lee sold Arlington House back to the United States Government for $150,000. In 1897, Lee resigned as president of Washington and Lee University. He then moved to the home of his late brother, Major General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s Ravensworth Mansion. Custis Lee died on February 18, 1913, in Alexandria, Virginia, and is buried in the University Chapel, near his family members. He never married, and had no children.

<text>&quot;Ring a Ring o&#x27; Roses&quot;, also known as &quot;Ring a Ring o&#x27; Rosie&quot; or (in the United States) &quot;Ring Around the Rosie&quot;, is a nursery rhyme, folk song, and playground game. Descriptions first appeared in the mid-19th century, though it is reported to date from decades earlier. Similar rhymes are known across Europe, with varying lyrics. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7925.

The origin of the song is unknown, and there is no evidence supporting the popular 20th-century interpretation linking it to the Great Plague or earlier outbreaks of bubonic plague in England.

==Lyrics==
The origins and earliest wording of the rhyme remain unknown. In many versions of the game, a group of children forms a ring, dances in a circle around one person, and then stoops or curtsies on the final line. The slowest child to perform this action may face a penalty or become the &quot;rosie&quot; (literally: rose tree, from the French &quot;rosier&quot;), taking their place in the center of the ring.

Common British versions include:
Common American versions include:
Some versions replace the third line with &quot;Red Bird Blue Bird&quot; or &quot;Green Grass-Yellow Grass,&quot; and the ending may be changed to &quot;Sweet bread, rye bread,/ Squat!&quot; Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book (1882) describes this variation, noting it as &quot;One, two, three—squat!&quot; Before the final line, the children suddenly stop, then shout it together, &quot;suiting the action to the word with unfailing hilarity and complete satisfaction.&quot;

An Indian version ends with: &quot;Husha busha! / We all fall down!&quot;

===Early attestation===
Variations, corruptions, and adaptations of the rhyme have been noted to exist long before its earliest printed versions. One such variation was recorded as being used in Connecticut in the 1840s. A novel from 1855, &quot;The Old Homestead&quot; by Ann S. Stephens, includes the following version:
 

Another early record of the rhyme appears in Kate Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;Mother Goose; or, the Old Nursery Rhymes&quot; (1881):
In his &quot;Games and Songs of American Children&quot; (1883), William Wells Newell describes several variants, including one with a melody that he dates to around 1790 in New Bedford, Massachusetts:
Newell notes that &quot;[a]t the end of the words the children suddenly stoop, and the last to get down undergoes some penalty, or has to take the place of the child in the centre, who represents the &#x27;rosie&#x27; (rose-tree; French, &quot;rosier&quot;).&quot; In an 1846 article from the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, a different version of the game called &quot;Ring o&#x27; Roses&quot; is described. In this version, a group of young children forms a ring, from which a boy selects a girl and kisses her. 

An 1883 collection of Shropshire folklore includes the following version:
On the final line, &quot;they stand and imitate sneezing&quot;. The Opies, in their &quot;Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes,&quot; record similar variations that have appeared over time.

===European variants===

A German rhyme, first printed in 1796, closely resembles &quot;Ring a ring o&#x27; roses&quot; in its first stanza and includes similar actions, with sitting rather than falling as the concluding gesture:

A loose translation reads: &quot;Round about in rings / We children three / Sit beneath an elderbush / And &#x27;Shoo, shoo, shoo&#x27; go we!&quot; This rhyme, which appears in the popular collection &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;, is well known in Germany and has many local variations.

Another German version reads:

In translation: &quot;A ring, a ring o&#x27; roses, / Lovely apricots, / Violets blue, forget-me-nots, / Sit down, children all!&quot;

Swiss versions of the rhyme involve children dancing around a rosebush. Other European singing games with a strong resemblance include &quot;&quot; (&quot;Rose, rose, May&quot;) from the Netherlands, which has a similar tune to &quot;Ring a ring o&#x27; roses,&quot; and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Circle, circle, rose&quot;), recorded in Venice in 1874. In this Italian version, girls dance around a central girl, who skips and curtsies as directed by the verses and at the end kisses the one she likes best, choosing her to be in the middle for the next round.

==Paintings==
Evidence of similar children&#x27;s round dances appears in continental paintings. For example, Hans Thoma&#x27;s &quot;Kinderreigen&quot; (Children Dancing in a Ring) from 1872 depicts children dancing in an Alpine meadow, while a later version of the painting shows them dancing around a tree. The Florentine artist Raffaello Sorbi brought a similar scene into the Renaissance setting with his 1877 work &quot;Girotondo&quot; (Round Dance), where young maidens circle a child at the center to instrumental accompaniment.

The specific words to which these children danced are not recorded, but the scene&#x27;s familiarity was echoed by English artists who depicted similar scenes in the 19th century. In Thomas Webster&#x27;s &quot;Ring o&#x27; Roses&quot;, circa 1850, the children dance to the music of a seated clarinetist. Meanwhile, in Frederick Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Ring a Ring of Roses&quot; (the title under which it was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1885), the children are shown dancing around a tree. Two other artists associated with the Newlyn School also depicted the game: Elizabeth Adela Forbes in 1880 and Harold Harvey in a later work.

==Origin==
The origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and are subject to speculation. Folklore scholars consider the popular explanation linking it to the Great Plague, which has been common since the mid-20th century, to be unfounded.

===Theories from the late 19th century===
In 1898, &quot;A Dictionary of British Folklore&quot; suggested that the game may have pagan origins. This was based on a comparison in the &quot;Sheffield Glossary&quot; with Jacob Grimm’s &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;, which relates it to pagan myths. It cites a passage that reads, &quot;Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Freyja wept gold,&quot; suggesting that the game’s origins may involve pagan beings of light. Another interpretation is more literal, proposing that it involved making a &quot;ring&quot; around roses and ending with &quot;all fall down&quot; as a kind of curtsy.

In 1892, the American writer Eugene Field wrote a poem titled &quot;Teeny-Weeny&quot;, which specifically described fay folk playing ring-a-rosie.

According to &quot;Games and Songs of American Children&quot;, published in 1883, the &quot;rosie&quot; was thought to refer to the French word for rose tree, with children dancing and bowing to the person in the center. Some variations included literal falling down, which lessened the connection to the game-rhyme’s original form. In 1898, sneezing was also noted as a symbol with superstitious and supernatural significance across various cultures.

===The Great Plague explanation of the mid-20th century===
Since the Second World War, the rhyme has often been associated with the Great Plague of 1665 in England or with earlier outbreaks of the bubonic plague in England. However, interpreters of the rhyme before World War II make no mention of this connection. By 1951, this interpretation had become widely accepted as an explanation for the rhyme’s form that had become standard in the United Kingdom. Peter and Iona Opie, leading authorities on nursery rhymes, observed:

The line &quot;Ashes, Ashes&quot; in colonial versions of the rhyme has been claimed to refer variously to cremation of bodies, the burning of victims&#x27; houses, or the blackening of skin due to the disease. This theory has been adapted to explain other versions of the rhyme.

In its various forms, this interpretation has entered popular culture and has been referenced to make indirect connections to the plague. In 1949, a parodist created a version referencing radiation sickness:

In March 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the traditional rhyme was humorously suggested as the &quot;ideal choice&quot; of song to accompany hand-washing to ward off infection.

====Refutation====
Folklore scholars consider the Great Plague explanation of the rhyme to be unfounded:

* The plague explanation did not emerge until the mid-twentieth century.
* The symptoms described do not align closely with those of the Great Plague.
* The wide variety of forms makes it unlikely that the modern version is the most ancient one, and the words on which this interpretation is based are not present in many of the earliest records of the rhyme.
* European and 19th-century versions of the rhyme suggest that this &quot;fall&quot; was not a literal falling down, but rather a curtsy or other bending movement that was common in other dramatic singing games.

<text>The United States District Court for the District of Kansas (in case citations, D. Kan.) is the federal district court whose jurisdiction is the state of Kansas. The Court operates out of the Robert J. Dole United States Courthouse in Kansas City, Kansas, the Frank Carlson Federal Building in Topeka, and the United States Courthouse in Wichita. The District of Kansas was created in 1861, replacing the territorial court that preceded it, and President Abraham Lincoln appointed Archibald Williams as the Court&#x27;s first judge. 

Appeals from the District of Kansas are made to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

 the acting United States attorney is Duston J. Slinkard. On March 12, 2015, Ronald L. Miller, most recently police chief of Topeka, Kansas, was confirmed as U.S. Marshal.

The clerk of court is Skyler B. O&#x27;Hara, who is located in Topeka.

<text>Thin Thin Khaing () born 4 May 1978) is an athlete from Pegu, Burma. She competes in archery.

She is currently working in Sumitomo Corporation, Yangon, Myanmar.

Thin represented Myanmar at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She placed 38th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 622. In the first round of elimination, she faced 27th-ranked Małgorzata Sobieraj of Poland. Thin forced a tie-breaker by tying the match at 151 after the regulation 18 arrows. She then matched Sobieraj arrow for arrow through the three tie-breaker arrows, shooting two 9s and an 8. Unfortunately for Thin, Sobieraj&#x27;s final arrow was slightly closer to the center of the target, allowing Sobieraj to advance and eliminating Thin with a final rank of 39th overall in women&#x27;s individual archery.

<text>Malaysia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s twelfth appearance at the Olympics, although it had previously competed in two other games under the name &quot;Malaya&quot;. Malaysia, however, did not participate at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its partial support to the United States boycott.

With the absence of the men&#x27;s field hockey team, Olympic Council of Malaysia sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. A total of 26 athletes, 18 men and 8 women, competed in 11 sports. Nine Malaysian athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including badminton tandem Choong Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah, race walker Yuan Yufang, and US-based swimmers Alex Lim and Allen Ong. Being the youngest ever athlete of the team, fourteen-year-old diver Bryan Nickson Lomas was appointed by the council to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Malaysia also marked its official debut in archery.

Malaysia failed to win a single Olympic medal for the second consecutive time since the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where badminton pair Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock claimed a silver in the men&#x27;s doubles.

<doc id="914016" wikidata="Q116641" url="?curid=914016" title="Matt Cooke">
<text>Matthew David Cooke (born September 7, 1978) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played sixteen seasons and 1046 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). Cooke won the Stanley Cup with the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 2008–09 NHL season and was a member of the Team Canada team that won the gold medal at the 2004 World Championships. In addition to having played for the Penguins, he also played in the NHL with the Vancouver Canucks, Washington Capitals and Minnesota Wild. Cooke was born in Belleville, Ontario, but grew up in Stirling, Ontario. He served as head coach of the Newfoundland Growlers for the 2023/24 season.

Cooke&#x27;s playing style earned him the reputation as one of the NHL&#x27;s &quot;pests&quot;. During his NHL career, Cooke was criticized and often suspended for hits, some involving head-shots, or knee-on-knee collisions that have injured opposing players. Most notable was a hit to the head of Marc Savard, which was an important factor influencing NHL rule changes intended to deter such conduct. After his longest suspension in 2011 for a hit to the head of Ryan McDonagh, Cooke pledged to change his style of play, although he had another lengthy suspension in the 2014 playoffs for a knee-on-knee hit delivered to Tyson Barrie of the Colorado Avalanche.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Cooke played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Quinte minor ice hockey team from Belleville, Ontario.

Cooke played junior ice hockey in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for three seasons, predominantly with the Windsor Spitfires, prior to playing professionally. Recording an impressive 95-point (tenth overall in the league), 146-penalty-minute campaign in his second OHL season, he was drafted 144th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. Returning to the OHL for a third season after being drafted, he was traded from Windsor to the Kingston Frontenacs on December 17, 1997, in exchange for Brent L&#x27;Heureux. Cooke would finish the season and his OHL career with Kingston.

===Vancouver Canucks===
Splitting the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons between the Canucks and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, Cooke would play for the Canucks full-time in 2000–01.

Typically playing in the role of a checking winger, Cooke recorded a career-high 42 points in 2002–03 and earned the Fred J. Hume Award as the team&#x27;s unsung hero. Continuing to show offensive capabilities, after returning from an injury in 2003–04, he was promoted to the Canucks&#x27; top line towards the end of the season. On account of Todd Bertuzzi&#x27;s infamous suspension, Cooke joined Markus Näslund and Brendan Morrison on the Canucks&#x27; top line for the final 13 games of the season and the playoffs.

Perhaps Cooke&#x27;s most memorable moment with the Canucks occurred during this stint on the first line as the Canucks entered the 2004 playoffs against the Calgary Flames. With the Canucks down by a goal in the final minute of the series-deciding seventh game, Cooke drove the net on a Markus Näslund rush and dramatically tied the score with five seconds remaining in regulation; it was also Cooke&#x27;s second goal of the game. As the Canucks were short-handed at the time, however, Calgary began the overtime period on the powerplay and clinched the series.

After a year of inactivity on account of the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Cooke would play two more full seasons with the Canucks, scoring at a similar pace. With Cooke&#x27;s contract set to expire at the end of the 2007–08 season, he was sent to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Matt Pettinger at the trade deadline. The trade ended Cooke&#x27;s tenure with the Canucks in his ninth season with the club. At the time of the trade, he was 12th all-time in games played as a Canuck with 556.

===Washington Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins===

Finishing the 2007–08 season, Cooke would play 17 games with the Capitals, scoring seven points. In the off-season, on July 5, 2008, Cooke signed a two-year, $2.4-million contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins. He injured his ribs in his first season with the Penguins in October, missing four games, but was able to return by the end of the month. On December 2, 2008, he was named to the rotating position of alternate captain for the Penguins for the month of December. The next month, Cooke was suspended for two games on January 27, 2009, for a headshot that he delivered to Carolina Hurricanes forward Scott Walker seven days earlier. He was assessed a minor penalty for interference on the play. He earned the Stanley Cup with Pittsburgh in 2009.

Cooke set a new career high during the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs by scoring four post-season goals, two of those coming in the decisive Game 6 against the Ottawa Senators at Scotiabank Place. On June 22, 2010, Cooke signed a three-year contract to stay with the Penguins, a deal worth $1.8 million per season.

===Minnesota Wild===
Following his contract expiry with the Pittsburgh Penguins, on July 5, 2013, Cooke signed a three-year, $7.5 million contract with the Minnesota Wild. It marked Cooke&#x27;s return to the Western Conference after leaving the Vancouver Canucks during the 2007–08 season. Playing in all 82 games in the 2013-14 NHL Season, Cooke scored 10 goals along with 18 assists for 28 points in his first season with the Wild.

With Minnesota up against the Salary cap and suffering an injury plagued 2014–15 season, having appeared in just 29 regular season games, Cooke was placed on waivers in order to buy-out the final year of his three-year contract with the Wild on June 19, 2015.

==Criticism and suspensions==
During his career, Cooke has been criticized by the media, league, fans, and team executives, and other players for his hitting in ways more likely to cause injury such as hits to the head or hits to an opponent&#x27;s knee. Of note, CBC host and former head coach Don Cherry has been consistently and effectively critical of Cooke, personally, and has faulted the NHL for not responding appropriately to Cooke&#x27;s intents to render opposing players unable to play over the years.

In the 2008–09 season, with the Penguins, Cooke was suspended on two different occasions. In November, he received a two-game suspension for a check to the head of the New York Rangers&#x27; Artem Anisimov. In January 2009, he received another two-game suspension for a hit to the head of Scott Walker of the Carolina Hurricanes.

On March 7, 2010, in a game against the Boston Bruins, Cooke delivered a blow to the head of Boston&#x27;s Marc Savard, concussing Savard and forcing him to miss almost two months. Cooke said he was not intending to hurt Savard; Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli, however, characterized the hit as &quot;a very surgical hit to the head.&quot; 
Fellow Penguin teammate Bill Guerin also analyzed Cooke&#x27;s hit on Savard to Pittsburgh reporters. &quot;If a guy gets hurt like that with a shot to the head, there&#x27;s got to be something,&quot; said Guerin, adding that he expected Cooke to be suspended. &quot;I understand he (Cooke) is on my team but, hey, he&#x27;s in a tough spot.&quot; In a ruling, which has received wide criticism, Cooke was not given a suspension for the hit on Savard. On March 24, in response to the outcry over Cooke not being suspended, the league implemented a new rule aimed at prohibiting blindside hits to the head like the one Cooke delivered to Savard. In announcing the rule, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, &quot;The elimination of these types of hits should significantly reduce the number of injuries, including concussions, without adversely affecting the level of physicality in the game.&quot; Earlier, Bettman appeared on &quot;Leafs Lunch&quot; on Mojo 640 in Toronto to discuss the Cooke hit on Savard. &quot;I was very unhappy and upset with that hit,&quot; said Bettman. &quot;I was more upset there was nothing (in the League rules) to do to punish it.&quot;
On February 9, 2011, Cooke was given a four-game suspension for a hit from behind on Columbus Blue Jackets&#x27; defenceman Fedor Tyutin. On March 21, Cooke was suspended for the final ten games of the Penguins&#x27; regular season schedule, as well as the first round of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, stemming from an elbow to the head of New York Rangers defenceman Ryan McDonagh. The suspension was the longest of Cooke&#x27;s career and was supported by the Penguins. Penguins General Manager Ray Shero said in a statement that the hit was &quot;exactly the kind of hit we&#x27;re trying to get out of the game,&quot; and that Penguins officials had told Cooke &quot;in no uncertain terms&quot; that such play was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Speaking to two Pittsburgh newspapers the day after the incident, Cooke apologized for the hit. &quot;I realize and understand, more so now than ever, that I need to change,&quot; Cooke said.

===&quot;Changing&quot; his game===
With the suspension and then Pittsburgh&#x27;s early elimination from the playoffs, Cooke had a considerable amount of free time. He spent much of the time with Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma reviewing each of his hits to learn how to change his game to hit within the rules. Cooke said, &quot;The way I played before was to get the biggest hit possible every time no matter what,&quot; and that now in &quot;certain situations, I just approach differently. I try to get the puck more than I did before.&quot; Well into the 2011–12 season, teammate Craig Adams said of Cooke&#x27;s play, &quot;I&#x27;ve noticed over the last month or so, he&#x27;s been feeling more comfortable being physical again, obviously, within the rules. That was a big part of his game.&quot; At season&#x27;s end, he had scored a career-high 19 goals and posted only 44 penalty minutes, his lowest career total in a full NHL season.

In February 2013, Cooke was involved in an incident with the Ottawa Senators in which Erik Karlsson&#x27;s achilles tendon was cut by Cooke&#x27;s skate as the two made contact along the boards. While Senators owner Eugene Melnyk was outraged by the incident, stating, &quot;To have him (Karlsson) taken out by a goon is unconscionable,&quot; league officials determined there would be no supplemental discipline for Cooke.

On April 21, 2014, during Game 3 of the first round of the 2014 playoffs against the Colorado Avalanche, Cooke, playing for the Minnesota Wild, delivered a knee-on-knee check to Avalanche defenceman Tyson Barrie. Barrie did not return to the game and it was announced that he would miss four-to-six weeks as a result of the Cooke check. After an in-person hearing with the Department of Player Safety, Cooke was suspended for seven games for his conduct. As per the stipulations governing suspensions during the playoffs, Cooke did not suffer any loss of income.

==Coaching career==
On October 7, 2023, Cooke was hired as the head coach of the Newfoundland Growlers in the ECHL. He remained in that position until the Growlers organization were forced to cease operations on April 2, 2024.

==International play==


Cooke made his first international appearance, playing for the Canadian national junior team at the 1998 World Junior Championships. He scored two points in six games, but could not help Canada win a medal, as Canada lost to Russia in the quarter-finals, then to the US and Kazakhstan, finishing eighth overall behind Kazakhstan. He then competed for Team Canada at the 2004 World Championships. Named to the team with Vancouver Canucks teammate Brendan Morrison, Cooke helped Canada clinch gold, tallying four points in nine games.

==Personal life==
Cooke and his wife Michelle, whom he married in 2001, have three children; a daughter, a son, and a stepdaughter. Cooke and Michelle ran a foundation called The Cooke Family Foundation of Hope, based out of Vancouver. It was dissolved in 2016.

==Awards==
*Fred J. Hume Award (Vancouver Canucks&#x27; unsung hero) – 2003
*Gold medal (Team Canada) – 2004 World Championships

<doc id="914017" wikidata="Q703201" url="?curid=914017" title="The Notwist">
<text>The Notwist are a German indie rock band. Formed in 1989, the band moved through several musical incarnations, despite maintaining a relatively stable line-up. While their early records moved through heavy metal into dark indie rock, their recent efforts for which they have received the most attention have been strongly influenced by the electronica scene, along with other groups on the record label Morr Music.

== History ==
The Acher brothers and Messerschmid formed the group in 1989, in Weilheim in Oberbayern, near Munich. In 1990, they recorded their self-titled debut, a grunge-metal oriented LP. 1992 saw the release of &quot;Nook&quot;, which has an indie rock sound, while their 1995 album &quot;12&quot;, contains their first flirtation with electronics. Martin Gretschmann then joined the group in 1997. &quot;Shrink&quot;, released in 1998, is a jazz-electro-rock album. In 1998, Cynthia Dall did the vocals for a remix of &quot;Torture Day&quot; by The Notwist. The album &quot;Neon Golden&quot; (released in 2002) put them on the map for American listeners, with its heartfelt sentiment and more pop-oriented sound.

Messerschmidt left the group in 2007, and was replaced by Andi Haberl. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;The Devil, You + Me&quot;, was released in Europe in May 2008. On June 17, 2008 the album was released in North America on Domino Records.

In 2009, the Notwist recorded &quot;Storm&quot;, the soundtrack to the film of the same name by director Hans-Christian Schmid. In late 2012 they began playing songs from a new album on tour. The album, &quot;Close to the Glass&quot;, was released on February 24, 2014 under Sub Pop Records.

In 2014, Martin Gretschmann left the group.

In January 2015, &quot;Close to the Glass&quot; was nominated for IMPALA&#x27;s European Independent Album of the Year Award.

==Collaborations and side projects==
The group has been remixed by Four Tet, Caribou, Grizzly Bear, Console, Loopspool, Panda Bear and others. Singer Markus Acher also collaborated with Anticon and rapper/producer Alias on the song, &quot;Unseen Sights&quot;. In 1991, Markus Acher founded Village of Savoonga,a more experimental ensemble that incorporates noise, post rock and even neoclassical elements in Weilheim, Germany. The band, that included elements of Tied &amp; Tickled Trio, Fred Is Dead and others, released &quot;Village Of Savoonga&quot; (1992), &quot;Philipp Schatz&quot; (1996) and &quot;Score&quot; (1997).

The Notwist formed a group with Themselves named 13 &amp; God, whose eponymous debut was released in 2005. Markus Acher, in addition to his work with The Notwist and 13 &amp; God, also worked with the band Lali Puna until his departure in 2017, while Mecki Messerschmidt now also plays drums for the reformed Schweisser. Micha Acher composes and programs for Ms. John Soda.

<doc id="914020" wikidata="Q374521" url="?curid=914020" title="Bahmani Kingdom">
<text>The Bahmani Kingdom or the Bahmani Sultanate was a late medieval kingdom that ruled the Deccan plateau in India. The first independent Muslim sultanate of the Deccan, the Bahmani Kingdom came to power in 1347 during the rebellion of Ismail Mukh against Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi. Ismail Mukh then abdicated in favour of Zafar Khan, who established the Bahmani Sultanate.

The Bahmani Kingdom was perpetually at war with its neighbours, including its rival to the south, the Vijayanagara Empire, which outlasted the sultanate. The Mahmud Gawan Madrasa was created by Mahmud Gawan, the vizier regent who was prime minister of the sultanate from 1466 until his execution in 1481 during a conflict between the foreign (Afaqis) and local (Deccanis) nobility. Bidar Fort was built by Ahmad Shah I (), who relocated the capital to the city of Bidar. Ahmad Shah led campaigns against Vijayanagar and the sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat. His campaign against Vijayanagar in 1423 included a siege of the capital, ending in the expansion of the Sultanate. Mahmud Gawan would later lead campaigns against Malwa, Vijayanagar, and the Gajapatis, and extended the sultanate to its maximum extent.

The sultanate began to decline under Mahmood Shah. Through a combination of factional strife and the revolt of five provincial governors (tarafdars), the Bahmani Sultanate split up into five states, known as the Deccan sultanates. The initial revolts of Yusuf Adil Shah, Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I, and Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk in 1490 and Qasim Barid I in 1492 saw the end of any real Bahmani power, and the last independent sultanate, Golkonda, in 1518, ended the Bahmanis&#x27; 180 year rule over the Deccan. The last four Bahmani rulers were puppet monarchs under Amir Barid I of the Bidar Sultanate, and the kingdom formally dissolved in 1527.

==Origin==

The Bahmani Kingdom was founded by Zafar Khan, who was of either Afghan or Turkic origin. &quot;Encyclopedia Iranica&quot; states him to be a Khorasani adventurer, who claimed descent from Bahrām Gōr. According to the medieval historian Ferishta, his obscurity makes it difficult to track his origin, but he is nonetheless stated as of Afghan birth. Ferishta further writes, Zafar Khan had earlier been a servant of a Brahmin astrologer at Delhi named Gangu, giving him the name Hasan Gangu, and says that he was from North India. Historians have not found any corroboration for the legend, but Barani, who was the court chronicler of Sultan Firuz Shah, as well as some other scholars have also called him Hasan Gangu. Another theory of origin for Zafar Khan is that he was of Brahmin origin, and that Bahman (his given name following the establishment of the sultanate) is a corrupted personalized form of Brahman, with Hasan Gangu being a Hindu Brahman who became Muslim. However this view has been discredited by S.A.Q. Husaini, who considers the idea of a Brahmin origin or Zafar Khan originally being a Hindu convert to Islam from Punjab untenable.

== History ==
Ziauddin Barani, the court chronicler of Sultan Firuz Shah, states that Hasan Gangu, the Bahmani Sultanate&#x27;s founder, was &quot;born in very humble circumstances&quot; and that &quot;For the first thirty years of his life he was nothing more than a field laborer.&quot; He was made a commander of a hundred horsemen by the Delhi Sultan, Muhammad bin Tughluq, who was pleased with his honesty. This sudden rise in the military and socio-economic ladder was common in this era of Muslim India. Zafar Khan or Hasan Gangu was among the inhabitants of Delhi who were forced to migrate to the Deccan, to build a large Muslim settlement in the region of Daulatabad. Zafar Khan was a man of ambition and looked forward to the adventure. He had long hoped to employ his body of horsemen in the Deccan as the region was seen as the place of bounty in Muslim imagination at the time. He was rewarded with an Iqta for taking part in the conquest of Kampili.

===Rise===
Before the establishment of his kingdom, Hasan Gangu (Zafar Khan) was Governor of Deccan and a commander on behalf of the Tughlaqs. On 3 August 1347, during the rebellion by the Amirs of the Deccan, Ismail Mukh, the leader of the rebellion (whom the rebel &quot;amirs&quot; of the Deccan placed on the throne of Daulatabad in 1345), abdicated in favor of Zafar Khan, resulting in the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom. The Sultan of Delhi had besieged the rebels at the citadel of Daulatabad. As another rebellion had begun in Gujarat, the Sultan left and installed Shaikh Burhan-ud-din Bilgrami and Malik Jauhar and other nobles in charge of the siege. Meanwhile, as these nobles were unable to stop the Deccani amirs from pursuing the imperial army, Hasan Gangu, a native of Delhi, then being pursued by Governor of Berar Imad-ul-Mulk, the leader to whom the Deccani Amirs had re-assembled against, attacked and slew the latter and marched on towards Daulatabad. Here Hasan Gangu and the Deccani amirs put to flight the imperial forces which had been left to besiege. The rebels at Daulatabad had the sense to see Hasan Gangu as the man of the hour, and the proposal to crown Hasan Gangu, entitled Zafar Khan, was accepted without a dissentient voice on 3 August 1347. His revolt was successful, and he established an independent state on the Deccan within the Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s southern provinces with its headquarters at Hasanabad (Gulbarga), where all his coins were minted.

With the support of the influential Indian Chishti Sufi Shaikhs, he was crowned &quot;Alauddin Bahman Shah Sultan – Founder of the Bahmani Dynasty&quot;. They bestowed upon him a robe allegedly worn by the prophet Muhammad. The extension of the Sufi&#x27;s notion of spiritual sovereignty lent legitimacy to the planting of the sultanate&#x27;s political authority, where the land, people, and produce of the Deccan were merited state protection, no longer available for plunder with impunity. These Sufis legitimized the transplantation of Indo-Muslim rulership from one region in South Asia to another, converting the land of the Bahmanids into being recognized as Dar ul-Islam, while it was previously considered Dar ul-Harb.

Turkish or Indo-Turkish troops, explorers, saints, and scholars moved from Delhi and North India to the Deccan with the establishment of the Bahmanid sultanate. How many of these were Shi&#x27;ites is unclear. Nonetheless, there is enough evidence to demonstrate that a number of nobility at the Bahmani court identified as Shi&#x27;ites or had significant Shi&#x27;ite inclinations.

===Succeeding rulers (1358–1422)===

Alauddin was succeeded by his son Mohammed Shah I. His conflicts with the Vijayanagar empire were singularly savage wars, as according to the historian Ferishta, &quot;the population of the Carnatic was so reduced that it did not recover for several ages.&quot; The Bahmanids&#x27; aggressive confrontation with the two main Hindu kingdoms of the southern Deccan, Warangal and Vijayanagara in the First Bahmani–Vijayanagar War, made them renowned among Muslims as warriors of the faith.

The Vijayanagara empire and the Bahmanids fought over the control of the Godavari-basin, Tungabadhra Doab, and the Marathwada country, although they seldom required a pretext for declaring war, as military conflicts were almost a regular feature and lasted as long as these kingdoms continued. Military slavery involved captured slaves from Vijayanagara whom were then converted to Islam and integrated into the host society, so they could begin military careers within the Bahmanid empire.

Ghiyasuddin succeeded his father Muhammad II at the age of seventeen in April 1397, but was blinded and imprisoned by a Turkic slave called Taghalchin, who had held a grudge on the Sultan for the latter&#x27;s refusal to appoint him as a governor. He had lured the Sultan into putting himself in the former&#x27;s power, using the beauty of his daughter, who was accomplished in music and arts, and had introduced her to the Sultan at a feast. He was succeeded by Shamsuddin, who was a puppet king under Taghalchin. Firuz and Ahmed, the sons of the fourth sultan Daud, marched to Gulbarga to avenge Ghiyasuddin. Firuz declared himself the sultan, and defeated Taghalchin&#x27;s forces. Taghalchin was killed and Shamsuddin was blinded.

Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah became the sultan in November 1397. Firuz Shah fought against the Vijayanagara Empire on many occasions and the rivalry between the two dynasties continued unabated throughout his reign, with victories in 1398 and in 1406, but a defeat in 1417. One of his victories resulted in his marriage to the daughter of Deva Raya, the Vijayanagara Emperor.

Firuz Shah expanded the nobility by enabling Hindus and granting them high office. In his reign, Sufis such as Gesudaraz, a Chishti saint who had immigrated from Dehli to Daulatabad, were prominent in court and daily life. He was the first author to write in the Dakhni dialect of Urdu. The Dakhni language became widespread, practised by various milieus from the court to the Sufis. It was established as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Muslims of the Deccan, as not only the aspect of a dominant urban elite, but an expression of the regional religious identity.

===Later rulers (1422–1482) ===
Firuz Shah was succeeded by his younger brother Ahmad Shah I Wali. Following the establishment of Bidar as capital of the sultanate in 1429, Ahmad Shah I converted to Shi&#x27;ism. Ahmad Shah&#x27;s reign was marked by relentless military campaigns and expansionism. He imposed destruction and slaughter on Vijayanagara and finally captured the remnants of Warangal. 

Alauddin Ahmad II succeeded his father to the throne in 1436. The Chand Minar, a minaret in Daulatabad, was constructed under his reign, and was commemorated in his honour in 1445 for his victory against Deva Raya II of Vijayanagara in 1443, the last major conflict between the two powers. For the first half-century after the establishment of the Bahmanids, the original North Indian colonists and their sons had administered the empire quite independent of either the non-Muslim Hindus, or the Muslim foreign immigrants. However, the later Bahmani Sultans, mainly starting from his father Ahmad Shah Wali I, began to recruit foreigners from overseas, whether because of depletion among the ranks of the original settlers, or the feelings of dependency upon the Persian courtly model, or both. This resulted in factional strife that first became acute in the reign of his son Alauddin Ahmad Shah II. In 1446, the powerful Dakhani nobles persuaded the Sultan that the Persians were responsible for the failure of the earlier invasion of the Konkan.

The Sultan, drunk, condoned a large-scale massacre of Persian Shi&#x27;a Sayyids by the Sunni Dakhani nobles and their Sunni Abyssinian slaves. A few survivors escaped the massacre dressed in women&#x27;s clothing and convinced the Sultan of their innocence. Ashamed of his own folly, the Sultan punished the Dakhani leaders who were responsible for the massacre, putting them to death or throwing them in prison, and reduced their families to beggary. The accounts of the violent events likely included exaggerations as it came from the pen of the chroniclers who were themselves mainly foreigners and products of Safavid Persia.
The eldest sons of Humayun Shah, Nizam-Ud-Din Ahmad III and Muhammad Shah III Lashkari ascended the throne successively, while they were young boys. The vizier Mahmud Gawan ruled as regent during this period, until Muhammad Shah reached age. Mahmud Gawan is known for setting up the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa, a center of religious as well as secular education, as well as achieving the sultanate&#x27;s greatest extent during his rule. He also increased the administrative divisions of the sultanate from four to eight to ease the administrative burden from previous expansion of the state. Gawan was considered a great statesman, and a poet of repute.

Mahmud Gawan was caught in a struggle between a rivalry between two groups of nobles, the Dakhanis and the Afaqis. The Dakhanis made up the indigenous Muslim elite of the Bahmanid dynasty, being descendants of Sunni immigrants from Northern India, while the Afaqis were foreign newcomers from the west such as Gawan, who were mostly Shi&#x27;is. The Dakhanis believed that the privileges, patronage and positions of power in the sultanate should have been reserved solely for them.

The divisions included sectarian religious divisions where the Afaqis were looked upon as heretics by the Sunnis as the former were Shi&#x27;as. Eaton cites a linguistic divide where the Dakhanis spoke Dakhni while the Afaqis favored the Persian language. Mahmud Gawan had tried to reconcile with the two factions over his fifteen-year prime ministership, but had found it difficult to win their confidence; the party strife could not be stopped. His Afaqis opponents, led by Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri and motivated by anger over Mahmud&#x27;s reforms which had curtailed the nobility&#x27;s power, fabricated a treasonous letter to Purushottama Deva of Orissa which they purported to be from him. Mahmud Gawan was ordered executed by Muhammad Shah III, an act that the latter regretted until his death in 1482. Upon his death, Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri, the father of the founder of the Nizam Shahi dynasty became the regent of the Sultan as prime minister.

===Decline===
Muhammad Shah III Lashkari was succeeded by his son Mahmood Shah Bahmani II, the last Bahmani ruler to have real power. The tarafdars of Ahmednagar, Bijapur, and Berar, Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I, Yusuf Adil Shah, and Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk agreed to assert their independence in 1490, and established their own sultanates but maintained loyalty to the Bahmani Sultan. The sultanates of Golconda and Bidar would become in practice independent as well. In 1501, Mahmood Shah Bahmani united his amirs and wazirs in an agreement to wage annual Jihad against Vijayanagara. The expeditions were financially ruinous.

The last Bahmani Sultans were puppet monarchs under their Barid Shahi prime ministers, who were the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers. After 1518 the sultanate formally broke up into the five states of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. They are collectively known as the Deccan sultanates.

== Historiography ==
Modern scholars like Haroon Khan Sherwani and Richard M. Eaton have based their accounts of the Bahmani dynasty mainly upon the medieval chronicles of Firishta and Syed Ali Tabatabai. Other contemporary works were the Sivatattva Chintamani, a Kannada language encyclopedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith, and Guru Charitra. Afanasy Nikitin, a Russian merchant and traveler, traveled through the Bahmani Sultanate in his journeys. He contrasts the huge &quot;wealth of the nobility with the wretchedness of the peasantry and the frugality of the Hindus&quot;.

== Culture ==

The Bahmani dynasty patronized Indo-Muslim and Persian culture from Northern India and the Middle East. However, the society of the Bahmnanis was dominated prominently by Iranians, Afghans, and Turks. They also had considerable and social influence such as with the celebration of Nowruz by Bahmani rulers. This also comes as Mohammed Shah I ascended the throne on Nowruz. According to Khafi Khan and Ferishta, musicians flocked to the court from Lahore, Delhi, Persia and Khorasan.

The Bahmani Sultans were patrons of the Persian language, culture and literature, and some members of the dynasty became well-versed in the language and composed its literature in the language.

The first sultan, Alauddin Bahman Shah, is noted to have captured 1,000 singing and dancing girls from Hindu temples after he battled the northern Carnatic chieftains. The later Bahmanis also enslaved civilian women and children in wars; many of them were converted to Islam in captivity.

=== Bidriware ===
Bidriware is a metal handicraft from the city of Bidar in Karnataka. It was developed in the 14th century during the rule of the Bahmani Sultans. The term &quot;bidriware&quot; originates from the township of Bidar, which is still the chief center of production. The craftspersons of Bidar were so famed for their inlay work on copper and silver that it came to be known as Bidri. The metal used is white brass that is blackened and inlaid with silver. As a native art form, Bidriware obtained a geographical Indications (GI) registry on 3 January 2006.

=== Architecture ===

The Bahmani Sultans patronized many architectural works, although many have since been destroyed. The Gulbarga Fort, Haft Gumbaz, and Jama Masjid in Gulbarga, the Bidar Fort and Madrasa Mahmud Gawan in Bidar, and the Chand Minar in Daulatabad are some of their major architectural contributions.

The later Sultans were buried in a necropolis known as the Bahmani Tombs. The exterior of one of the tombs is decorated with coloured tiles. Arabic, Persian and Urdu inscriptions are inscribed inside the tombs.

The Bahmani Sultans built many mosques, tombs, and madrasas in Bidar and Gulbarga, the two capitals. They also built many forts in Daulatabad, Golconda and Raichur. The architecture was highly influenced by Persian architecture, as they invited architects from Persia, Turkey and Arabia. The Persianate Indo-Islamic style of architecture developed during this period was later adopted by the Deccan sultanates as well.

===Turquoise Throne===

The Turquoise Throne was a jeweled royal throne mentioned by Firishta. It was the seat of the sultans of the Bahmani Sultanate since Mohammed Shah I (1358–1375). It was a gift of Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka, a Telugu King in post-Kakateeya era. It was mentioned by Firishta that on 23 March 1363, this throne replaced an earlier silver throne that the first Bahmani sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah used.

== Gunpowder weapons ==

The Bahmani Sultanate was likely the first state to invent and utilize gunpowder artillery and firearms within the Indian Subcontinent. Their firearms were the most advanced of their time, surpassing even those of the Yuan Dynasty and the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. The first recorded use of firearms in South Asia was at the Battle of Adoni in 1368, where the Bahmani Sultanate led by Mohammed Shah I used a train of artillery against the Vijayanagara Empire who was led by Harihara II. Following the initial use of gunpowder weapons in 1368, they became the backbone of the Bahmani army.

The scholar Iqtidar Alam Khan claims, however, that based on a differing translation of a passage of medieval historian Firishta&#x27;s text &quot;Tarikh-i Firishta&quot;, in which he describes early use of gunpowder weapons in the Indian Subcontinent, it can be inferred that both the Delhi Sultanate and non-Muslim Indian states had the gunpowder weapons that the Bahmani Sultanate began to use in 1368, and that the Bahmanis had acquired the weapons from the Delhi Sultanate. Contemporary evidence shows the presence of gunpowder for pyrotechnic uses in the Delhi Sultanate, and Alam Khan states that their usage in the Battle of Adoni in 1368 was rather the first military usage of gunpowder-derived objects in the Subcontinent. According to Klaus Rötzer, these early pyrotechnic weapons were used primarily to frighten enemy cavalry and elephants.

The Bahmani Sultanate used cannons while besieging the Fort of Machal in 1470 or January 1471. This was the first known use of gunpowder in siege weaponry on the Deccan Plateau.

<doc id="914025" wikidata="Q1369492" url="?curid=914025" title="Triune brain">
<text>The triune brain was a once popular, now proven false, model of the evolution of the vertebrate forebrain and behavior, proposed by the American physician and neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean in the 1960s. The triune brain consists of the reptilian complex (basal ganglia), the paleomammalian complex (limbic system), and the neomammalian complex (neocortex), viewed each as independently conscious, and as structures sequentially added to the forebrain in the course of evolution. According to the model, the basal ganglia are in charge of primal instincts, the limbic system is in charge of emotions, and the neocortex is responsible for objective or rational thoughts.

Since the 1970s, the concept of the triune brain has been subject to criticism in evolutionary and developmental neuroscience and is regarded as a myth. Although it overlaps in some respects with contemporary understanding of the brain, the triune brain hypothesis is no longer espoused by comparative neuroscientists in the post-2000 era due to harsh criticism against it.

MacLean originally formulated his model in the 1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990 book &quot;The Triune Brain in Evolution&quot;. The triune brain hypothesis became familiar to a broad popular audience through Carl Sagan&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning 1977 book &quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot;.

==Aspects==
===Reptilian complex===
&quot;Reptilian complex&quot; (also known as the &quot;R-complex&quot;, &quot;reptilian brain&quot; or &quot;lizard brain&quot;) was the name MacLean gave to the basal ganglia, structures derived from the floor of the forebrain during development. The term derives from the idea that comparative neuroanatomists once believed that the forebrains of reptiles and birds were dominated by these structures. MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species-typical instinctual behaviours involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays.
===Paleomammalian complex===
This consists of the septum, amygdalae, hypothalamus, hippocampal complex, and cingulate cortex. MacLean first introduced the term &quot;limbic system&quot; to refer to this set of interconnected brain structures in a paper in 1952. MacLean&#x27;s recognition of the limbic system as a major functional system in the brain was widely accepted among neuroscientists, and is generally regarded as his most important contribution to the field. MacLean maintained that the structures of the limbic system arose early in mammalian evolution (hence &quot;paleomammalian&quot;, with &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;old&quot;) and were responsible for the motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behaviour, and parental behaviour. 
===Neomammalian complex===
This consists of the cerebral neocortex, a structure found uniquely in higher mammals, and especially humans. MacLean regarded its addition as the most recent step in the evolution of the mammalian brain, conferring the ability for language, abstraction, planning, and perception. 

== Interactions between structures ==
The triune brain model argues that these structures are relatively independent from one another, but that they are still connected to each other in some form or another.

The model views different cognitive behaviors as caused by three different entities instead of one. The reptilian complex is said to control all of the instinctual and impulsive actions, while the neomammalian complex is responsible for keeping the primitive instincts constrained. An example is controlling the impulse of eating. It seems that if one is hungry, then that means the reptilian complex is commanding the body to eat. However, an individual has the rational choice not to eat when hungry, and this rational thought is said to be controlled by the neomammalian complex. The model thus suggest that these two (and three depending on the situation) structures are in a perpetual battle to control the body.

These interactions between the neocortex and the reptilian brain often seem competitive as the conscious thought generated by the neocortex can suppress the primitive thoughts generated by the reptilian complex. Thus, the model suggests that the interactions between structures are not constructive, but that they are conflicting due to the anatomical separation of the brain. 

This separation of structures proposed an underlying difference between consciousness and unconscious behaviour and argued that the reason why humans are such intelligent and conscious species is due to the not-so-common neocortex that they possess, unlike most other animals. This detachment contributes to the idea that the three complexes interact with each other separately rather than a single construct interacting with itself.

== Status of the model ==
MacLean originally formulated the triune brain hypothesis in the 1960s, drawing on comparative neuroanatomical work done by Ludwig Edinger, Elizabeth C. Crosby and Charles Judson Herrick early in the twentieth century. The 1980s saw a rebirth of interest in comparative neuroanatomy, motivated in part by the availability of a variety of new neuroanatomical techniques for charting the circuitry of animal brains. Subsequent findings according to human brain evolution expert Terrence Deacon, have refined the traditional neuroanatomical ideas upon which MacLean based his hypothesis. Deacon mentioned that &#x27;the evolutionary addition of different parts of the brain is simply not realistic. However, all the parts of the brain were already existing, they were just further developed upon as the homosapien species evolved and gained life experiences.&#x27; 

For example, the basal ganglia (structures derived from the floor of the forebrain and making up MacLean&#x27;s reptilian complex) were shown to take up a much smaller portion of the forebrains of reptiles and birds (together called sauropsids) than previously supposed, and to exist in amphibians and fish as well as mammals and sauropsids. Because the basal ganglia are found in the forebrains of all modern vertebrates, they most likely date to the common evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates, more than 500 million years ago, rather than to the origin of reptiles.

Recent behavioral studies do not support the traditional view of sauropsid behavior as stereotyped and ritualistic (as in MacLean&#x27;s reptilian complex). Birds have been shown to possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as the toolmaking of the New Caledonian crow and the language-like categorization abilities of the grey parrot. Structures of the limbic system, which MacLean proposed arose in early mammals, have now been shown to exist across a range of modern vertebrates. The &quot;paleomammalian&quot; trait of parental care of offspring is widespread in birds and occurs in some fishes as well. Thus, like the basal ganglia, the evolution of these systems presumably dates to a common vertebrate ancestor.

Finally, recent studies based on paleontological data or comparative anatomical evidence strongly suggest that the neocortex was already present in the earliest emerging mammals. In addition, although non-mammals do not have a neocortex in the true sense (that is, a structure comprising part of the forebrain roof, or pallium, consisting of six characteristic layers of neurons), they possess pallial regions, and some parts of the pallium are considered homologous to the mammalian neocortex. While these areas lack the characteristic six neocortical layers, birds and reptiles generally possess three layers in the dorsal pallium (the homolog of the mammalian neocortex). The telencephalon of birds and mammals makes neuroanatomical connections with other telecencephalic structures like those made by neocortex. It mediates similar functions such as perception, learning and memory, decision making, motor control, conceptual thinking.

== Lay interest ==
The triune model of the mammalian brain is seen as an oversimplified organizing theme in the field of comparative neuroscience. It continues to hold public interest because of its simplicity.
Howard Bloom, in his 1995 book &quot;The Lucifer Principle&quot;, references the concept of the triune brain in his explanations of certain aspects of human behavior. Arthur Koestler made MacLean&#x27;s concept of the triune brain the centerpiece of much of his later work, notably &quot;The Ghost in the Machine&quot;. English novelist Julian Barnes quotes MacLean on the triune brain in the foreword to his 1982 novel &quot;Before She Met Me&quot;. Peter A. Levine uses the triune brain concept in his book &quot;Waking the Tiger&quot; to explain his somatic experiencing approach to healing trauma. In the series of novels written by Lee Child featuring knight-errant figure Jack Reacher, Reacher often experiences messages from what he calls his &quot;lizard brain&quot; that alert him to potential danger. In &quot;Disco Elysium&quot;, the player character interfaces directly with his limbic system and &quot;ancient reptilian brain&quot; at various points throughout the game, alongside the players skill set acting as a representation of his posterior neocortex.

Glynda-Lee Hoffmann, in her book &quot;The Secret Dowry of Eve, Women&#x27;s Role in the Development of Consciousness&quot;, references the triune theory explored by MacLean and goes one step further. Her theory about human behavior, and the problems we create with that behavior, distinguishes the prefrontal cortex as uniquely different from the rest of the neocortex. The prefrontal cortex, with its agenda of integration, is the part of the brain that can get the other parts to work together for the good of the individual. Hoffmann claims that in many humans the reptilian cortex (agenda: territory and reproduction; in humans that translates to power and sex) is out of control, and the amygdala stokes the fear that leads to more bad behavior.

<text>Cuba competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s seventeenth appearance in the Olympics, except for some editions. Cuban athletes did not attend in two Olympic Games (1984 and 1988), where they joined the Soviet and North Korean boycott. Cuban Olympic Committee sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since 1972. A total of 151 athletes, 97 men and 54 women, competed in 18 sports.

The Cuban team featured seven defending Olympic champions from Sydney: taekwondo jin Ángel Matos in the men&#x27;s welterweight division, the women&#x27;s volleyball team (led by Yumilka Ruíz), boxers Mario Kindelán and Guillermo Rigondeaux, Greco-Roman wrestler Filiberto Azcuy, sprint hurdler Anier García, and long jumper Iván Pedroso, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Among the champions, Kindelan and Rigondeaux managed to defend Olympic titles in their respective weight categories. Skeet shooter Guillermo Alfredo Torres, the oldest athlete of the team at age 45, became the first Cuban athlete to compete in five Olympic Games since 1980; meanwhile, judoka Yamila Zambrano was the youngest of the team at age 18.

Cuba left Athens with a total of 27 Olympic medals (9 gold, 7 silver, and 11 bronze), failing only two golds short of the total record achieved from Sydney. Eight of these medals were awarded to the athletes in boxing, six in judo, and five in athletics. Cuba&#x27;s team-based athletes proved successful in Athens, as men&#x27;s baseball and women&#x27;s volleyball teams won gold and bronze medals, respectively. Among the nation&#x27;s gold medalists were Osleidys Menéndez, who previously won the bronze in Sydney and also, became the first non-European athlete to claim an Olympic title in women&#x27;s javelin throw since María Caridad Colón did so in 1980. On August 23, 2004, the International Olympic Committee stripped off Russia&#x27;s Irina Korzhanenko shot put title after failing the doping test for stanozolol, and the gold medal was subsequently awarded to Yumileidi Cumbá at the conclusion of the Games.

Yumileidi Cumbá originally claimed a silver medal in women&#x27;s shot put. On August 23, 2004, the International Olympic Committee stripped off Russia&#x27;s Irina Korzhanenko shot put title after failing the doping test for stanozolol. Following the announcement of Annus&#x27; disqualification, Cumba&#x27;s medal was eventually upgraded to gold.

Cuba, by far the most successful country at boxing in the 2004 Olympics, entered a boxer in each of the 11 weight classes in Athens. None of the seven boxers with a round of 32 match lost it. Only one of the boxers fell in the round of 16 (also the only boxer not to win a match), with the other ten advancing to quarterfinals. Two lost there, while the remaining eight ensured medals for themselves by winning their quarterfinal matches. One lost in the semifinal, earning a bronze medal. Of the seven Cuban boxers that advanced to the final bout in their weight classes, five won the match to take gold and two lost to claim silver medals.

<text>The Dark Knight Strikes Again, also known as Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again and DK2, is a 2001–2002 DC Comics three-issue limited series comic book written and illustrated by Frank Miller and colored by Lynn Varley, featuring the fictional superhero Batman. The series is a sequel to Miller&#x27;s 1986 miniseries &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. It tells the story of an aged Bruce Wayne who returns from three years in hiding, training his followers and instigating a rebellion against Lex Luthor&#x27;s dictatorial rule over the United States. The series features an ensemble cast of superheroes including Catgirl, Superman, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man, Green Arrow, The Flash, and the Atom.

==Overview==
The series was originally published as a three-issue limited series published by DC Comics between November 2001 and July 2002. It has since been published as hardcover and paperback one-volume editions and as the &quot;Absolute Dark Knight&quot; edition with &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. Like its predecessor, this story takes place in a timeline that is not considered canonical in the current DC Comics continuity.

==Synopsis==
After going underground, Batman (Bruce Wayne) and his young sidekick Catgirl (formerly Carrie KelleyRobin) train an army of &quot;Batboys&quot; (the former Mutants and other recruits) to save the world from a police dictatorship led by Lex Luthor. In a series of raids on government facilities, Batman&#x27;s soldiers release other superheroesincluding Atom, Flash and Plastic Manfrom captivity. Elongated Man is recruited and Green Arrow is already working with Batman.

Superman, Wonder Woman, and Captain Marvel have been forced to work for the US government, as their loved ones are being held hostage. Superman is ordered by &quot;President Rickard&quot; (a computer-generated front for Lex Luthor and Brainiac) to stop Batman. He confronts Wayne at the Batcave, but Batman and the other superheroes defeat him. Meanwhile, Batman&#x27;s raids have been noticed by the media. After being banned for years, the freed superheroes have recaptured the public imagination and have become a fad among the youth. At a pop concert by &quot;The Superchix&quot;, Batman and the other heroes make a public appearance urging their fans to rebel against the oppressive government.

During this time, rogue vigilante Question spies on Luthor&#x27;s plans and types a journal to record the misdeeds of those in power. Question tries to convince the Martian Manhunternow an aged, bitter, near-powerless figure with his mind filled with Luthor&#x27;s nanotechnologyto stand up against Superman and the government. Question and Martian Manhunter are attacked by a mysterious man resembling the Joker, who is seemingly invulnerable to injury. Martian Manhunter sacrifices his life and Question is rescued by Green Arrow. The mysterious man escapes to kill other superheroes including Guardian and Creeper, stealing their costumes and wearing them.

An extraterrestrial monster lands in Metropolis and begins to destroy the city. Batman is convinced that it is an attempt to lure him and his allies out of hiding and does not respond, dismissing Flash&#x27;s appeal that they are supposed to save lives. Batman&#x27;s opinion is that it is too risky to save the lives of the populace. Superman and Captain Marvel fight the monster, which is revealed to be Brainiac, who coerces Superman into defeat using the bottled Kryptonian city of Kandor as leverage, to crush the people&#x27;s faith in superheroes. Captain Marvel is killed defending citizens from the carnage but Superman is saved when his daughter Lara appears. She has been carefully hidden since birth, but, now that the government knows she exists, they demand that she be handed over.

Deciding that Batman and his methods are the only way, Superman, Wonder Woman and Lara join him. Lara pretends to hand herself over to Brainiac. Atom slips into the bottle and frees the Kandorians, who use their combined heat vision to destroy Brainiac. The superheroes then destroy the dictatorship&#x27;s power source and incite a revolution. Batman allows himself to be captured and tortured by Luthor to learn his plans. Luthor has launched satellites to destroy most of the world&#x27;s population, leaving him with a more manageable number of people. The Green Lantern, who has turned into pure will, returns from space and destroys Luthor&#x27;s satellites. Luthor is in turn killed by the son of Hawkman and Hawkgirl (Shayera Hol).

Returning to the Batcave, Batman is contacted by Carrie, who is being attacked by the Joker-like man, who is now wearing a Robin costume. Batman arrives and recognizes the man as Dick Grayson, the first Robin who Batman fired long ago. Grayson has been genetically altered to have a powerful healing factor and shape-shifting ability, but is criminally insane. As Batman and Grayson contemptuously recall their bleak history together, Batman drops him through a trapdoor into a miles-deep crevasse filled with lava, while Elongated Man rescues Carrie. Grayson clings onto a ledge, climbs out of the chasm and faces Batman. When Grayson remains virtually unharmed by everything Batman throws at him, Batman hurls himself and Grayson into the chasm. Grayson falls into the lava and is disintegrated. Superman rescues Batman at the last minute as the Batcave explodes, and takes him to Carrie in the Batmobile.

==Background and creation==
In 2006, Frank Miller said of the creation process for &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;:

==Critical reception and sales==
&quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot; received mixed to negative reviews, with criticism focusing on its artwork, storyline, and character development. Claude Lalumière of &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; gave the series a mixed review and said &quot;the script lacks the emotional nuances of its predecessor, and ... the artwork is rushed and garish&quot;, and that it &quot;has considerable chutzpah, but its careless execution is regrettable&quot;. Roger Sabin of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the series has &quot;flashes of brilliancefew can control page layouts like Millerbut in general the idea of the ironic superhero seems rather dated.&quot;

The first issue of &quot;DK2&quot; ranked #1 in December 2001 with pre-order sales at 174,339. The second issue of &quot;DK2&quot; was ranked third in sales for the January 2002 period with pre-order sales of 155,322. The final issue of the series had pre-order sales of 171,546 returning to #1 for the month of February 2002. The comic had an in-store date on July 31 of that same year.

Discussing the negative reception for &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;, Frank Miller said in 2006: &quot;I expected shock. I wanted it. I never make it my mission to reassure people. Time will make its own judgement.&quot;

==Sequel==

On April 24, 2015, DC Comics announced that Frank Miller was co-writing a sequel to &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot; with Brian Azzarello titled &quot;The Dark Knight III: The Master Race&quot;. The series featured a rotating cast of artists, including Andy Kubert and Klaus Janson. Frank Miller later confirmed that &quot;The Master Race&quot; would not be the conclusion, and he was beginning work on a fourth series.

<text>Spring Point Ledge Light is a sparkplug lighthouse in South Portland, Maine, which marks a dangerous obstruction on the west side of the main shipping channel into Portland Harbor. It is now adjacent to the campus of Southern Maine Community College. It was constructed in 1897 and automated in 1960.

==History==
The lighthouse was constructed in 1897 by the government after seven steamship companies stated that many of their vessels ran aground on Spring Point Ledge. Congress initially allocated $20,000 to its construction, although the total cost of the tower ended up being $45,000 due to problems with storms and poor-quality cement. The lighthouse featured a fog bell that sounded twice every twelve seconds, and a lantern fitted with a fifth-order Fresnel lens first lit by keeper William A. Lane on May 24, 1897.

Improvements were made to the lighthouse throughout the 20th century. It was electrified in 1934, and in 1951, a 900-foot breakwater, made from of granite, was constructed in order to connect the lighthouse to the mainland. The lighthouse was originally owned and operated by the United States Coast Guard (USCG); however, on April 28, 1998, the Maine Lights Selection Committee approved a transfer of ownership of the tower to the Spring Point Ledge Light Trust, with the USCG retaining only the light and fog signal. On May 22, 1999, Spring Point Ledge Light was opened to the public for the first time in its history. Adjacent to the lighthouse is Fort Preble, the Southern Maine Community College Campus, and a small gift shop.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Spring Point Ledge Light Station on January 21, 1988.

<doc id="914036" wikidata="Q886985" url="?curid=914036" title="Mohini Bhardwaj">
<text>Mohini Bhardwaj (born September 29, 1978) is an American retired artistic gymnast who competed at the 1997 and 2001 World Championships and earned a silver medal with the American team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and is a member of the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame. She is the first Indian-American gymnast, and the second Indian-American athlete in any sport, to medal at the Olympics.

==Early life and career==
Bhardwaj was born in Philadelphia to parents Indu and Kaushal. She has one younger brother, Arun. Her mother, Indu, is a Russian from New York who converted to Hinduism and teaches yoga; her father is from India and is a physician in Cincinnati. Bhardwaj was raised in the Hindu faith and is vegetarian. Her given name, Mohini, means &quot;the one who mesmerizes&quot; in Sanskrit.

She began taking gymnastics classes at the age of four in her hometown, Cincinnati, where she attended Seven Hills School. At the age of 13, she moved to Orlando to train at Brown&#x27;s Gymnastics. When she was 16, her coach, Alexander Alexandrov, moved to Houston to open a new facility for Brown&#x27;s, and Bhardwaj followed without her parents. Living alone in a Texas apartment, her gymnastics suffered.

At the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials, Bhardwaj finished in 10th place, missing a spot on the team by 0.075. She continued training after the Olympics, but at the 1997 U.S. Nationals, NBC commentators noted that she was only competing at her parents&#x27; insistence. Still, she finished third in the all-around at Nationals and earned a spot on the 1997 World Championships team. At Worlds, she was the only American besides Kristen Maloney to qualify for an individual event final, the vault, where she placed fifth.

==NCAA career==
Bhardwaj&#x27;s reputation as a wild child scared off some NCAA recruiters, but Valorie Kondos Field, the head coach for the UCLA Bruins gymnastics team, awarded her a full scholarship. Her partying continued through her freshman year, prompting Kondos to issue her an ultimatum to remain on the team.

By 1999, Bhardwaj had changed her ways and became a key member of the Bruins, with increased difficulty on all four events. During her time at UCLA, Bhardwaj earned All-American honors 11 times, earned 23 individual titles, and was the first gymnast from UCLA to be a four-time All-American on the uneven bars. As a senior, she won both the AAI Award and the Honda Sports Award. She was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013.

=== Career Perfect 10.0 ===
==2001–2004==
After ending her UCLA career, Bhardwaj returned to elite competition. At the 2001 National Championships, she won the vault title and placed third in the all-around. She was named to the American team for the 2001 World Championships in Ghent, Belgium, where she contributed to the U.S. squad&#x27;s bronze medal. Individually, she placed 18th in the all-around and 7th in the vault event final.

In 2002, she suffered a dislocated elbow and retired for a year before deciding to return to training in 2003. Off the national team and running low on funds, she took odd jobs, such as waitressing and delivering pizzas, to pay for her training and personal expenses. By 2004, she was in debt and could not afford to attend the Olympic Trials and other competitions. &quot;Baywatch&quot; star Pamela Anderson, who learned of Bhardwaj&#x27;s situation when she purchased a raffle ticket on her behalf, became a personal supporter and gave Bhardwaj $20,000 for her training expenses.

At the 2004 Nationals, Bhardwaj placed a disappointing 12th in the all-around, only securing the final spot in the Olympic Trials when Ashley Postell fell on bars. But she went on to finish sixth at the Trials, earning an invitation to the subsequent closed-door selection camp. There, she impressed national team coordinator Márta Károlyi and the other selectors enough not only to earn a place on the team, but to be named its captain. Her strength and consistency on vault were expected to add balance to a team already formidable on beam and bars, but at the Olympics, she placed 20th on vault and failed to qualify for the event final.

Bhardwaj was the only American to qualify for the floor final at the Olympics, where she finished in sixth place. She finished eighth all-around in qualifying, behind teammates Carly Patterson (1st) and Courtney Kupets (4th), but was not among the 24 gymnasts to advance because of a rule limiting each country to two competitors in the final. Bhardwaj was the only gymnast in the top ten in qualifications who did not make the all-around final. In the team final, however, she was integral to the team&#x27;s silver-medal effort: In addition to improving her vault from preliminaries and performing a strong floor exercise, she filled in on beam at the last minute when Kupets decided to sit it out because of a leg injury.

For her Olympic achievements, Bhardwaj was named the India Abroad Person of the Year for 2004.

After the Olympics, Bhardwaj joined the other members of the U.S. team on a national exhibition tour. She tried to continue competing into 2005 and was selected for the American Cup in January, but she had insufficient training time and withdrew. She retired from competitive gymnastics in 2005, at the age of 26. She was inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Eponymous skill==
Bhardwaj was the first gymnast to perform the full-twisting Pak Salto, and it is named after her in the Code of Points.

==Post-retirement==
Bhardwaj owns OOA Gymnastics in Bend, Oregon, where she coaches, and has also worked with Olympic hopeful gymnasts at Dan Alch Camp of Champions in Anchorage, Alaska. She became interested in CrossFit in 2016, enjoying the weightlifting aspect of training, and began competing in weightlifting in 2018.

She is married to Jeff Barry. They have one son, Tristen, who was born in 2009.

<doc id="914048" wikidata="Q3417215" url="?curid=914048" title="Rafael Bielsa">
<text>Rafael Antonio Bielsa Caldera (born February 15, 1953) is an Argentine Justicialist Party politician from Rosario, province of Santa Fe. He was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2003 to 2005. From 2020 to 2023 he was also Argentina&#x27;s ambassador to Chile.

==Early life and education==
Bielsa spent his childhood in Morteros, Córdoba, the birthplace of his mother. He studied at the Faculty of Law of the National University of Rosario and became a lawyer. Bielsa is also a poet, writer and essayist. He is the brother of former Argentina national football team coach Marcelo Bielsa; both are well-known Newell&#x27;s Old Boys supporters. He is also the brother of architect María Eugenia Bielsa, Vice-Governor of Santa Fe from 2003 to 2007 and Minister of Habitat from 2019 to 2020.

In 1974 Bielsa began at the Federal Court of Rosario. In 1977, during the Dirty War, suspected of being a member of the Montoneros radical guerrilla group, Bielsa was detained and taken to the &quot;El Castillo&quot; (also known as &quot;El Fortín&quot;) illegal detention centre, where he spent two months of questioning and torture. After a period in Spain, he returned to Argentina in 1980, and started working in different positions of the military government, mainly in the Ministry of Justice.

==Political career==
Upon the return to democracy in 1983, Bielsa worked in a Secretariat of the Ministry of Education in different functions. He served as adviser to the Office of the President of Argentina during the early years of the Carlos Menem administration, at the Ministry of Justice, as well as for specific international projects and other posts. He published several books of poetry during the 1980s and 1990s.

Bielsa was the foreign minister of Argentina from 25 May 2003, when President Néstor Kirchner took office, until 6 December 2005. At the 2005 legislative elections he won a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, representing the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. At the last moment (just before the inauguration ceremony), after a request by the President, he chose not to take office, instead accepting an appointment to become Ambassador in France; however, the next day he retracted (citing moral qualms and the pressure from public opinion as the reason) and decided to occupy his legislative seat after all. Both decisions were heavily criticized by the opposition and political analysts in the media; the latter one was also qualified in harsh terms by government supporters themselves. Bielsa remained close to the President despite these problems.


He competed with fellow party member Agustín Rossi in the primary elections held on 1 July 2007, and was elected candidate of the Justicialist Party for the governorship of Santa Fe by a wide margin. He lost the main election, on 2 September, to the Socialist former mayor of Rosario Hermes Binner. Bielsa received 38.8% of the vote. After acknowledging the defeat, he announced he would also be resigning from his post as representative for Buenos Aires, which he did five days later.
From 2011 to 2013, Bielsa was the secretary in charge of the Secretariat of Programming for the Prevention of Drug Addiction and the Fight against Drug Trafficking (SEDRONAR).

<text>Now on PBS, shown onscreen as NOW, is a Public Broadcasting Service newsmagazine which aired between 2002 and 2010, focusing on social and political issues.

==History==
First airing in January 2002, and originally called Now with Bill Moyers, the program was launched as a collaboration between NPR news and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The program featured documentary reporting, interviews and commentary on current events. Bill Moyers served initially as sole host of the program while NPR reporters and commentators produced individual segments for the hour long-program.

In the autumn of 2003, David Brancaccio was introduced as a co-host. In 2004, Kenneth Tomlinson, the Chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, paid an outside consultant $14,000 to watch &quot;NOW with Bill Moyers&quot; and analyze the politics of the show. The study was not approved by the CPB. After the study became public in 2005, the CPB-funded NPR, among other organizations, criticized the resulting study as being full of errors and a waste of money.

In the summer of 2004 the Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced that it would no longer provide funding for &quot;Now&quot;. Moyers subsequently announced that he would leave the show after the 2004 U.S. elections and appeared for the last time on December 17, 2004. After his departure, the show was reduced to a half hour.

Maria Hinojosa was credited as a senior correspondent for the show while presenting many investigative pieces. She and Brancaccio became the only two presenters and usually alternated segments.

In November 2009 it was announced that the program had been canceled, and its last episode aired on April 30, 2010.

==Awards==

In 2008 &quot;Now&quot; was awarded the Edward R. Murrow Award, Overseas Press Club for a story on child brides. &quot;NOW on PBS&quot; was also awarded a National Business EmmyAward in 2007 and a National News Emmy Award for best newsmagazine segment in 2004.

<text>María Carolina Barco Isakson (born 1951) is a Colombian-American diplomat, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia from 2002 to 2007, and then as Ambassador of Colombia to the United States from 2006 to 2010.

She served as the Colombian ambassador to Spain in 2019 and 2020.

==Personal life==
Carolina Barco Isakson is a daughter of Virgilio Barco Vargas, a former mayor, senator, ambassador, President of Colombia and director to the World Bank Board. Her mother, Carolina Isakson Proctor, an American-born former First Lady of Colombia, helped to create, and then direct, Colombia&#x27;s national anti-poverty program, &quot;Bienestar,&quot; which was established in February 1987 to provide food and day care for Colombian&#x27;s poorest children.

Carolina Barco was born in Boston, Massachusetts while her father, Virgilio Barco Vargas, was there studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1973, Barco received her bachelor of arts degree in Sociology and Economics from Wellesley College in Massachusetts. During her time at Wellesley, she spent a year studying abroad at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. In 1975, she received a master&#x27;s degree in city planning from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design. In 1984, she received a master of business administration at IE Business School in Madrid, Spain. From 1990 to 1991, she was a visiting scholar at her father&#x27;s alma mater, MIT.

Carolina Barco was married to Mauricio Botero Caicedo, with whom she had three daughters. Her brother, Virgilio Barco Isakson, founded one of Colombia&#x27;s largest gay civil rights NGOs, Colombia Diversa.

==Career==
Barco conducted research from 1988 to 1999 at the University of the Andes. Assessing the growth of Bogotá and its neighboring towns and cities, she generated information which helped to formulate future urban and territorial growth policies to improve sustainability.

 Barco was appointed Foreign Minister of Colombia by President Álvaro Uribe in August 2002 and remained in that post until July 2006, when she was appointed Ambassador to the United States, replacing former Colombian president Andrés Pastrana Arango in Washington, D.C.

In September 2003, she was announced by &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; as one of the invited speakers at its annual &quot;America&#x27;s Conference.&quot; The theme for the October program was &quot;Rebuilding Hemispheric Relations: New Economic Perspectives and Changing Foreign Policy Realities.&quot;

In 2007, she was one of several high-ranking political figures, celebrities and prominent athletes who attended a black-tie gala for the Formula Smiles Foundation, which was hosted by NASCAR driver Juan Pablo Montoya in the art district of Miami, Florida. Montoya&#x27;s BeLive Gala raised funds for six Colombian charities.

One of twenty-five women stationed in Washington, D.C. as ambassadors from their respective nations in 2010, Barco was the only female ambassador representing Latin America that year.

In 2019 and 2020, she served as the Colombian ambassador to Spain.

<text>Dartmouth College&#x27;s Alumni Gymnasium, located in Hanover, New Hampshire, in the United States, is the center of Dartmouth College&#x27;s athletic life and hosts venues for many of Dartmouth&#x27;s 34 varsity sports. After its completion in 1910, it was considered to be one of the most complete athletic facilities in the Eastern United States. The gymnasium contains two swimming pools, intramural basketball courts, championship basketball courts, two weight rooms, squash courts, 1/13 of a mile jogging track, two saunas, fencing lanes, and a rowing tank for crew training.
Alumni Gymnasium was designed by Charles Rich and Fredrick Mathesius. Construction began in 1909 under College President Ernest Fox Nichols. The cornerstone of the gymnasium contains several historical objects, including a file of the &quot;New Gymnasium News&quot;, copies of the student newspaper &quot;The Dartmouth&quot;, the Dartmouth humor magazine the &quot;Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern&quot;, and the yearbook, the &quot;Aegis&quot;. The building cost approximately $190,000. In 1938, engineers from the Thayer School of Engineering constructed a springy board track of Canadian spruce around the inside of the gym which was used by Glenn Cunningham to break the American mile record that year. The record was disallowed because Cunningham had been aided by pacing runners.

During World War I, the gymnasium was converted into barracks, and during World War II, was used as an armory and lounge. In 1962–1963, the gym was extensively remodeled to include a new basketball court and added to the Dartmouth College aquatic facilities with the addition of the Karl B. Michael Pool. In 1972, the year the college went coed, a two-story women&#x27;s locker room was added to the southeast corner.

Alumni Gymnasium completed a $12 million renovation in the spring of 2006. As part of the renovation efforts, Alumni Gym now features a fitness center built into the second floor, 8 new multi-purpose fitness rooms that together add roughly of new usable space, structural enhancements to the Karl Michael Pool, new entrances, an elevator servicing all floors of the gym, and handicap accessible upgrades.

<text>Leech Lake (translated from the Ojibwe language Gaa-zagaskwaajimekaag: Lake abundant with bloodsuckers) is a lake located in north central Minnesota, United States. It is southeast of Bemidji, located mainly within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, and completely within the Chippewa National Forest. It is used as a reservoir. The lake is the third largest in Minnesota, covering with of shoreline and has a maximum depth of .

==Hydrology==

Leech Lake outlets to the Leech Lake River, which flows into the Mississippi River. The sole outlet to the Leech Lake River is controlled by a dam in order to regulate water levels of the lake. Leech Lake has seven major inlets that include Portage Lake Creek, Sucker Creek, Steamboat River, Benedict River, Shingobee River, Bishop Creek, and the Boy River. There are also nine minor inlets that flow into Leech Lake.
===Islands===
Leech Lake hosts eleven islands that cover a total of 1,617 acres of land. 160 sq miles

The following list is in order from largest to smallest.
* Bear Island
* Minnesota Island
* Pelican Island
* Headquarters Bay Island
* Big Pipe Island
* Goose Island
* Bog (Duck) Island
* Narrows Island
* Little Bear Island
* Little Pelican Island
* Gull Island
* Shingobee Island
The long, narrow Shingobee Bay is part of Leech Lake, and is located on its southern end. Shingobee Bay, and the adjacent Walker Bay, boast some of the deepest parts in the entire lake.

==Ecology==

===Invasive species===
* &quot;Lythrum salicaria&quot;
Also known as purple loosestrife. This is an invasive plant that takes over lake shores and marshes, replacing cattails and other native wetland plants. Purple loosestrife does not provide a sufficient food source, nesting area, or cover for the native animals. Also one plant can produce around two million seeds annually, and it spreads rapidly through aquatic systems.

* &quot;Typha angustifolia&quot;
Better known as the narrow-leaf cattail, this invasive plant is able to grow in deeper water (compared to its native counterparts). The narrow-leaf cattail competes with the native &quot;Typha latifolia&quot; (broad leaf cattail) and other native plants along Leech Lake.

===Aquatic life===
Leech Lake is a popular sport fishing hotspot, and is fished for many different types. The state record lake whitefish (12 lb, 4.5 oz) and pumpkinseed (1 lb, 5.6 oz) were both caught here in 1999.
Species of fish the lake contains:
* Black crappie
* Bowfin (dog fish) 
* Bluegill
* Brown bullhead
* Catfish
* Eelpout
* Hybrid sunfish
* Largemouth bass
* Muskellunge 
* Northern pike
* Pumpkinseed
* Rock bass
* Smallmouth bass
* Tullibee (cisco)
* Walleye
* White sucker
* Yellow bullhead
* Yellow perch
* Jackfish

===Vegetation===
*Wild rice 
Grows in the shallow depths of Leech Lake, emerging through over 4,000 acres of water. Wild Rice is a valuable crop for the Leech Lake community.
*Bulrush
Grass like plants that grow in water, they can reach lengths of around ten feet. These plants are an important food resources for aquatic life in Leech Lake.

===Eagles===

Leech Lake and the surrounding national forest is home to a large population of bald eagles. They are known to return to their same nests when mature. Populations have risen over the last few decades.

==History==
On early maps, Leech Lake is identified in French as &quot;lac Sangsue&quot; (Bloodsucker Lake), which was then translated into English to its current name; its French name was translated from the Ojibwe &quot;Ozagaskwaajimekaag-zaaga&#x27;igan&quot; (lake abundant with bloodsuckers).

In 1855, the Leech Lake Indian Reservation was established on the south shore of Leech Lake, along with two other Indian Reservations in the area, which along with two additional Indian Reservations, the five Indian Reservations were amalgamated in 1936 to form the current &quot;Greater&quot; Leech Lake Indian Reservation which encompasses most all of Leech Lake.

On October 5, 1898, Leech Lake was the location of a conflict between Ojibwe and Federal troops of the United States, the Battle of Sugar Point. A firefight broke out between the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe after one of the soldiers sent to retrieve a bootlegger mistakenly fired his rifle. Oscar Burkard received the Medal of Honor on August 21, 1899 for his participation in the battle.

In the summer of 1955, Leech Lake became famous for its musky fishing, as the &quot;Leech Lake Musky Rampage&quot; thrust it into the spotlight when hundreds of muskies were caught in a two-week period in July.

==Economy==

===Recreational/leisure use===
Every February, Leech Lake is home to the International Eelpout Festival. The eelpout, also known as the Burbot, is rarely seen in Leech Lake, except in the winter when it is very plentiful. Events include a black-tie dinner, ice bowling, and a contest to see who can catch the largest eelpout.

<text>Suffield Academy is a private preparatory school located in Suffield, Connecticut. It was founded in 1833 to train young men for ministry in the Baptist Church. The tuition fees for students are currently $71,500 for boarding students and $49,500 for day students. The head of the school is Charlie Cahn, who has been in post since 2004. The school is coeducational, with slightly more than half the students (55%) being boys. Approximately 15% of the student body are students of color, 18% are international students, and 67% are boarders.

Fourteen dormitories on campus house the boarding students with 90 faculty members serving as dormitory and student advisors as well as teachers and coaches.

Despite its founding links to the Baptist Church, the institute quickly moved towards a non-denominational model and in 1833 was renamed Connecticut Literary Institute, locally known as CLI. The institute was the only high school in town, and local government funding helped to pay for each student&#x27;s tuition.

<doc id="914090" wikidata="Q1021684" url="?curid=914090" title="Virtual office">
<text>A virtual office is part of the flexible workspace industry that provides businesses with any combination of services, space and/or technology, without those businesses bearing the capital expenses of owning or leasing a traditional office.

A virtual office can be used by entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small businesses that do not need or cannot afford a traditional office space. It can also be used by larger companies that want to establish a presence in a specific location without committing to a long-term lease.

Some virtual office providers offer additional services such as meeting room rentals, administrative support, and live receptionist services. These services are usually provided remotely, but also some virtual office providers have a physical office space where clients can have access to these services. This can be an attractive option for businesses that want to project a professional image without the cost of a full-time office.

Virtual office services started in the 1960s as serviced offices and have evolved with technology to include a wide variety of personnel, physical space, digital storage and communication services. Customers pay a contract fee for these services which may be offered à la carte, as packages or membership subscription. The concept is popular with companies of all sizes, including self-employed entrepreneurs. One of the primary allures of the virtual office is the flexibility it offers for employees and freelancers to work from a satellite office, home office, remote location or even on-the-go via a mobile device. At the same time, a company can offer its clients and employees a stable home office with access to amenities such as receptionist, conference rooms, desk space, mailboxes, printing and faxing at a permanent address, which are owned and maintained by the virtual office provider or a third party.

In 2021, a number of companies set out to fix the challenges of virtual meetings. This led to the appearance of virtual office software. When referring to a company having a virtual office, this no longer refers to a standard set of business services. Rather a virtual space for employees to gather and perform business-related activities.

Virtual office providers may also include digital capital such as cloud storage, web hosting, email and other web-based applications.

Also, according to the research, the attitudes and policies of employers in the virtual platform affect their employees&#x27; personal lives and productivity. Employees will be more productive if they believe their company trusts them, recognizes them, cares about them, and receives the proper training (including online processes, etc.), project management, and support to perform their tasks productively. When employees don&#x27;t have to spend time, money, or resources on transportation between home and work, it positively impacts employee productivity. That is why it became necessary to create an appropriate software environment to ensure these processes&#x27; functioning.

== History ==
The concept of a virtual office had roots before and during the Industrial Revolution, where parallels to current work styles, specifically working from home, have been drawn. The virtual office concept is an evolution of the traditional executive suite. As an executive suite, lease became increasingly impractical for certain types and stages of business, it naturally opened the door to a virtual office concept.

In the mid-20th century, professionals and executives began to examine ways to make more efficient use of the rising cost of real estate, personnel and other capital. Below are some milestones in the resulting evolution of the virtual office, along with the advent of technologies that help shape the industry.
== Prerequisites for the spread of virtual offices ==
The most significant factor in the spread of virtual offices was the forced transition to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Society introduced remote work quickly, so new technologies and operating systems must be adequately tested and trained.

Communication and getting to know other team members come naturally when everyone is working in the same place, so when working remotely, employees and managers have to make more effort to maintain relationships with colleagues. New employees need to learn organizational habits even while working remotely.

== Services ==
Virtual office infrastructure may include a variety of physical locations and services, as well as digital services. The infrastructure is shared across individuals and entities allowing resources to be used more efficiently. This allows users the flexibility of only renting or using the services they need.

===Physical===
* A business address
* Mail services (receive, pick up and/or forwarding)
* Conference rooms
* Desk space and private offices
* Printing and related services such as copying, binding, faxing, scanning, laminating, and shredding.
* Receptionist services and answering services
* Storage space
* Photography studio

===Digital===

* A phone number
* Online phone system (VoIP)
* Virtual assistants
* Virtual receptionists
* Website domains and email
* Instant Message, chat and other web-based RTC platforms
* Video conferencing, including webinar-hosting or other screensharing platforms
* Online digital storage
* Project management tools
* Cloud-based applications (e.g. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides or Office 365)

== Emerging Trends ==
Coworking is a related trend in flexible workspaces that places an emphasis on users interacting with each other to create an organizational culture without working for the same company. Similar to virtual offices, coworking venues offer serviced workspaces and customers can use these on an as-needed basis.

Virtual reality technology is another trend that may soon impact virtual offices. Virtual reality applications have the capability of creating offices spaces that are physical spaces within the virtual world where users can meet and work side-by-side.

<text>O.A.R. (short for Of A Revolution) is an American rock band, founded in 1996 in Rockville, Maryland. The band consists of lead vocalist/guitarist Marc Roberge, drummer Chris Culos, guitarist Richard On, bassist Benj Gershman, and saxophonist/guitarist Jerry DePizzo. Touring members include trumpet player Jon Lampley and keyboardist Mikel Paris. Together, the band has released ten studio albums. The band is well known for their live shows and extensive summer touring; they have released six live records, with the latest release, &quot;Live From Boston&quot;, in December 2024. Four of the band members grew up in Rockville, Maryland, and attended Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School. After graduating, they went on to study at Ohio State University, where they met the fifth member, saxophonist/guitarist Jerry DePizzo from Youngstown, Ohio.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1996–2004)===
After earlier iterations performing together as far back as middle school, O.A.R. was formed in 1996 by lead vocalist Marc Roberge and drummer Chris Culos, inspired in part by Roberge&#x27;s older brother, who plays drums for the band Foxtrot Zulu. They later recruited Richard On and Benj Gershman. In 1996, they recorded their debut album, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, at Gizmo Recording Company in Silver Spring, Maryland with engineer/producer Gantt Kushner. Many songs from the album, including &quot;Black Rock&quot; and &quot;That Was A Crazy Game of Poker&quot;, became staples of their live shows and are still played at most concerts today.

Three of the four band members attended one semester at Alexander Muss High School in Israel, graduated from Wootton High School in Rockville, Maryland, then moved to Columbus, Ohio, to attend Ohio State University. While at OSU, they met Jerry DePizzo, from Youngstown, Ohio. He joined the band as the saxophonist, completing the current lineup. In 1999, they returned to Gizmo Recording to record their second album, &quot;Soul&#x27;s Aflame&quot;.

Unlike other similar bands, O.A.R. did not use much formal advertising/marketing plans to obtain an audience, instead choosing to rely on word-of-mouth and touring alone. Their third album &quot;Risen&quot; debuted at No.11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; top internet sales chart. They received offers from various major labels but ultimately chose to sign with Lava Records in 2002. The following year, their fourth album &quot;In Between Now and Then&quot; debuted at No. 156 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

===Mainstream success (2005–present)===
In 2005, O.A.R. released their fifth album, &quot;Stories of a Stranger&quot;, which debuted at No. 40 on the Billboard 200. It produced the singles &quot;Love and Memories&quot;, &quot;Heard the World&quot;, and &quot;Lay Down.&quot; &quot;Love and Memories&quot; was the band&#x27;s first single to chart and receive significant radio airplay, peaking at 98 in the Pop 100, at 30 in Modern Rock Tracks, and at 18 in Adult Top 40. The music videos for &quot;Love and Memories&quot; and &quot;Lay Down&quot; received airplay on VH1 and MTV. The video for &quot;Lay Down&quot; received a &quot;Woodie&quot; award from MTV for streaming video.

On January 14, 2006, O.A.R. reached a new peak of popularity by drawing roughly 18,000 fans and selling out New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, which earned them a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. On October 5, 2006, a press release declared that O.A.R. had officially sold more than 1.2 million albums over their career. The band attributes much of its popularity to the recording and subsequent trading and downloading of their live shows.

On July 15, 2008, O.A.R. released their sixth studio album, &quot;All Sides&quot;. The first radio single for &quot;All Sides&quot;, &quot;Shattered (Turn the Car Around)&quot;, was released on June 13. Despite the band initially having hesitations about including the song on the album, it surpassed &quot;Love And Memories&quot;, peaking at 2 in Adult Top 40. In December 2008, VH1 named the music video for &quot;Shattered&quot; as number 18 on their Top 40 Videos of 2008.

In 2010, O.A.R. returned to the studio to record their seventh studio album, &quot;King&quot;. The band introduced several of their new songs during their 2010 tour, including &quot;Over and Over&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Connection&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Live.&quot; &quot;King&quot; was released on Wind-up Records on August 2, 2011, and debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200, the highest-charting debut for the band so far. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heaven&quot;, was released on June 7, 2011. On May 8, 2012, O.A.R. released a new single, &quot;Champions&quot; featuring rapper B.o.B, as part of a collaboration with Duracell in support of Team USA in the 2012 London Summer Olympics.

On November 19, 2012, O.A.R. released a live CD/DVD entitled &quot;Live on Red Rocks&quot;, which consists of footage and music from their performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on their 2012 summer tour.

In an interview with Billboard magazine posted on January 16, 2014, Jerry Depizzo revealed that their eighth studio album would be released in May 2014, and that the lead single would be &quot;Peace&quot;—a new song they played live many times on their 2013 summer tour. On March 21, 2014, the band announced via various social media sites that the new album, titled &quot;The Rockville LP&quot; would be released on June 10, 2014.

&quot;The Rockville LP&quot; debuted at number 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s top 200, #1 independent albums, #6 top current rock albums, and #7 current digital albums. 

On November 12, 2014, they were part, as many Southern rock and country music bands and singers, of a show in tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta.

In May 2016, the band announced the release of a career spanning compilation to coincide with their 20th anniversary. Entitled &quot;XX&quot;, the album was released on August 5, 2016, bundled with a disc of live performances and two new songs &quot;Follow Me, Follow You&quot; and &quot;I Go Through&quot;&quot;.&quot; The band embarked on a two-month tour of North America.

In 2018, O.A.R. returned to the studio to record their ninth studio album, &quot;The Mighty&quot;. The first single from the album is &quot;Miss You All the Time&quot;, released on October 12, 2018. &quot;The Mighty&quot; was presented and released to the public on March 29, 2019.

O.A.R. released a new single “Alive” on November 18, 2021, to tease out a forthcoming tour and album in 2022. The album, titled The Arcade, was their tenth album. It was released on July 15, 2022.

== Charitable endeavors and other appearances ==
The band&#x27;s Heard The World foundation was founded to support youth, education and sustainable programs both in the U.S. and abroad.

On December 14, 2012, O.A.R. performed with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra at the Music Center at Strathmore. The concert benefited the Heard the World Foundation.

In December 2009, Jerry DePizzo headlined a charity fundraiser for Music Loves Ohio in Columbus at The Basement.

The band worked with SAIC, a US defense contractor, to raise money for the Paralyzed Veterans of America, a service organization focused on assisting veterans with spinal cord injuries and diseases, through digital downloads of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Light Switch Sky.&quot; Proceeds from downloads of the song through July 22, 2010, supported paralyzed veterans. The song was co-written by O.A.R. and their fans through a competition on Twitter.

On October 4, 2012, the band headlined a &quot;But for Ohio State: Rock the Oval&quot; concert at Ohio State University to help raise money for the school that the band&#x27;s members attended.

O.A.R. and Phillip Phillips&#x27; 2014 Summer Tour benefited Habitat for Humanity.

<doc id="914097" wikidata="Q711806" url="?curid=914097" title="Tim Hardin">
<text>James Timothy Hardin (December 23, 1941 – December 29, 1980) was an American folk music and blues singer-songwriter and guitarist. In addition to his own success, his songs &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;, &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, &quot;Misty Roses&quot; and &quot;The Lady Came from Baltimore&quot; were hits for other artists. 

Hardin was raised in Oregon and had no interest in school, withdrawing before graduating high school, and joining the Marines. After his discharge, he moved to Greenwich Village and Cambridge, where he played and recorded several albums. He also performed at the Newport Folk Festival and at Woodstock. He struggled with drug abuse throughout most of his adult life and his live performances were sometimes erratic. He was planning a comeback when he died in late 1980 from an accidental heroin overdose.

==Early life and career==
Tim Hardin was born in Eugene, Oregon to Hal and Molly Hardin, who both had musical backgrounds. His mother was an accomplished violinist and concertmaster of the Portland Symphony Orchestra and his father played bass in jazz bands in the Army and in college.

While a student at South Eugene High School, Hardin first learned to play the guitar. When he was 18, he dropped out and joined the Marines, improving his guitar skills and building a repertoire of folk songs. He first tried heroin while stationed with the Marines in Southeast Asia.

After his discharge in 1961, Hardin moved to New York City, where he briefly attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He was eventually dropped for poor attendance and began to focus on his music, performing around Greenwich Village playing folk songs and blues. During this time, he became friends with fellow musicians Cass Elliot, John Sebastian and Fred Neil. He moved to Boston in 1963 and became part of a growing folk music scene there. In Boston, he was discovered by upcoming record producer Erik Jacobsen (later the producer for the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful), who arranged a meeting with Columbia Records. The next year, Hardin returned to Greenwich Village to record for Columbia and recorded several demos as an audition that the label did not release. Columbia soon terminated his contract. Verve Forecast would release these tracks six years later as &quot;Tim Hardin 4&quot;.

After moving to Los Angeles in 1965, Hardin met actress Susan Yardley Morss (known professionally as Susan Yardley) and returned to New York with her. He signed with Verve Forecast and released his first album, &quot;Tim Hardin 1&quot;, in 1966, which included &quot;How Can We Hang On to a Dream&quot;, &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; and the ballad &quot;Misty Roses&quot; to critical acclaim and mainstream radio airplay. That same year, he played at a Saturday afternoon workshop of contemporary and protest songs at the Newport Folk Festival.

Hardin was admired for his singing voice, described by a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer as &quot;a voice which quavers between the tugs of the blues and the tender side of joy. He can sing nasty, but his forte is gentle songs whose case allows him to slip and slide through a rainbow of emotions.&quot; However, Hardin said in another interview: &quot;I think of myself more as a singer than a songwriter and always did. It happened to be that I wrote songs. I’m a jazz singer, really, writing in a different vocabulary mode but still with a jazz feel. I don’t ever sing one song the same way. I’m an improvisational singer and player.”

He recorded &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot; in 1966, a song about his drug use and the alienation from his family. Bobby Darin, Ronnie Hawkins, Bill Staines, Joel Grey and Don McLean recorded cover versions of the song.

In 1967, Verve released &quot;Tim Hardin 2&quot;, which contained one of Hardin&#x27;s most famous songs, &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;. That same year, Atco, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, released an album of earlier material called &quot;This Is Tim Hardin&quot;, featuring covers of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, Fred Neil&#x27;s &quot;Blues on the Ceiling&quot; and Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; as well as the original songs &quot;Fast Freight&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;. The album&#x27;s liner notes state that Hardin recorded the songs in 1963–1964, well before the release of &quot;Tim Hardin 1&quot;. 

By 1967, after critical acclaim for Hardin&#x27;s first album and the release of &quot;This Is Tim Hardin&quot;, a wide variety of artists were covering his songs and he was in demand to tour Europe and the United States. However, the quality of his work was in decline partly because of &quot;his own combativeness in the studio, his addiction to heroin, his drinking problems and his frustration with his lack of commercial success&quot;. He began performing poorly and missing shows, reputedly falling asleep on stage at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in 1968. At the time, he was viewed as enigmatic, with one journalist stating that while &quot;his position as one of the best songwriters of his generation is unquestioned ... [he] ... courted the scene in the most fumbling manner imaginable&quot;. The same writer noted Hardin&#x27;s &quot;uninspired stage presence&quot; and seemingly ambivalent relationship with his audience, as he often ignored them, just singing &quot;at times badly, at times beautifully ... somehow always fascinating&quot;. The tour was cut short after Hardin contracted pleurisy.

In 1968, Verve released &quot;Tim Hardin 3 Live in Concert&quot;, a collection of live recordings along with remakes of earlier songs, followed by &quot;Tim Hardin 4&quot;. In September 1968, Hardin and Van Morrison shared a bill at the Cafe Au Go Go, each performing an acoustic set. In 1969, he signed with Columbia again, recording three albums for them, Suite for Susan Moore and Damion: We Are One, One, All in One, &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; and &quot;Painted Head&quot;. He had one of his few commercial successes with a non-album single, a cover of Bobby Darin&#x27;s &quot;Simple Song of Freedom&quot; that reached #48 in the U.S. as well as the Canadian charts. Because of his heroin use and stage fright, he was undependable in his live performances and he did not tour in support of the single.

In 1969, Hardin appeared at the Woodstock Festival, where he sang &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot; solo and played a set of his songs backed by a full band. None of his performances were included in the documentary film or the . His performance of &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot; was included in the 1994 box set &quot;&quot;.

==Later work and death==
In the years that followed, Hardin traveled between Britain and the U.S. In 1969, he went to England for a program to treat heroin addiction but was unsuccessful and became addicted to the barbiturates that were administered during the withdrawal stage. His heroin addiction controlled his life by the time his last album, &quot;Nine&quot;, was released in 1973 (the album was not released in the U.S. until Antilles Records released it in 1976). He sold the rights to his songs, but accounts of how this happened differ.

In late November 1975, Hardin performed as a guest lead vocalist with the German experimental rock band Can for two UK concerts at Hatfield Polytechnic in Hertfordshire and at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre. According to author Rob Young in the book &quot;All Gates Open: The Story of Can&quot;, during an argument with Can after the London concert, Hardin threw a television set through a car&#x27;s windshield.

After several years in Britain, Hardin returned to the U.S. in early 1980, writing ten new songs and recording them at home for a comeback. However, on December 29, his longtime friend Ron Daniels found him dead on the floor of his Hollywood apartment. The police determined that there was no evidence of foul play, and it was initially believed that Hardin had died from a heart attack. The Los Angeles coroner&#x27;s office later confirmed that the cause of death was an accidental heroin overdose. Hardin was interred at Twin Oaks Cemetery in Turner, Oregon. 

The following year, Columbia released his last work, eight unfinished tracks, on the posthumous album &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, along with a compilation of his previous work for the label titled &quot;The Shock of Grace&quot;.

==Covers==
Among his successes, Tim Hardin wrote the top 40 hit &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;, covered by Bobby Darin, Bob Dylan, Bob Seger, Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, the Four Tops, Robert Plant, Small Faces, Johnny Rivers, Bert Jansch, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Dolly Parton, Joe Nichols, The Free Design, Ernest Wilson, John Holt and others.

Many artists covered his song &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, such as the Carpenters, Neil Young and Rod Stewart, whose version became a #1 hit in the UK. &quot;How Can We Hang On to a Dream&quot; has been covered by Cliff Richard, Françoise Hardy, Marianne Faithfull, Fleetwood Mac, Peter Frampton, The Nice and Echo and the Bunnymen. Morrissey and Nico recorded versions of &quot;Lenny&#x27;s Tune&quot;. Bobby Darin and Johnny Cash both charted with covers of &quot;The Lady Came from Baltimore&quot;. Astrud Gilberto sang &quot;Misty Roses&quot; and Johnny Mathis had a top 40 hit with a cover version of the song.

==Tributes and legacy==
In 2005, the indie rock band Okkervil River released a tribute album called &quot;Black Sheep Boy&quot; said to be based on Hardin&#x27;s life. According to one reviewer, the concept of the album is a &quot;collection that should go some way towards rekindling an interest in his life and work&quot;. Will Sheff from Okkervil River said: &quot;There is something very disarming about how simple those songs are ..., a Tim Hardin song never outstays its welcome. It&#x27;s very short and pretty: one verse, one chorus, second verse, the song is over and he&#x27;s out of there. It&#x27;s like a tiny, perfectly cut gem&quot;.

In January of 2013, a tribute album, &quot;Reason to Believe: The Songs of Tim Hardin&quot; featuring indie and alternative rock bands from the U.K. and U.S. was released. Mark Lanegan, who sang Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Red Balloon&quot; on the album, told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been haunted by his devastating voice and beautiful songs ... I can&#x27;t imagine anyone hearing him and not feeling the same&quot;. Another performer on the album, Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith said of him that &quot;you get what he’s telling you without him spelling it out ... when it came time to make my first record, I kept that in mind&quot;. One music website initially described the album as appearing &quot;surprisingly mainstream&quot; but later acknowledged it in the article as a &quot;comprehensive package ... [that] ... transcends its limitations ... [with the folkier songs] ... capturing the fragility of Hardin&#x27;s original work without disrupting the moody, maudlin flow&quot;. The album was described as an opportunity to focus more on his music than his issues with drugs and his early death.

Roger Daltrey included &quot;How Can We Hang On to a Dream&quot; on a commemorative CD of his favorite music, which won the 2016 Music Industry Trusts Award. In the liner notes, Daltrey wrote: &quot;I was a huge fan of Tim&#x27;s&quot;.

On his third solo album, recorded in 2015, Pete Sando of the 1960s band Gandalf included a song called &quot;Misty Roses on a Stone&quot; that he cowrote as a dedication to Hardin after a visit to Hardin&#x27;s grave. Sando acknowledged that he was greatly influenced by Hardin, noting &quot;his lyrical economy and musical balance ... just the sheer simplicity and beauty of his songs was so appealing&quot;.

Bob Dylan reportedly said that Hardin was &quot;the greatest living songwriter&quot; after hearing his first album. In a 1980 interview when asked about the Dylan quote, Hardin recalled: &quot;Yeah, I played him part of the album one night and he started flipping out, you know. Man, he got down on his knees in front of me and said: &#x27;Don&#x27;t change your singing style and don&#x27;t bleep a blop...&#x27;&quot;. In the same interview, Hardin expressed some mixed feelings about Dylan, but in another article, Brian Millar concluded: &quot;Dylan was right: for some years, Tim Hardin was the greatest songwriter alive. And just as no one sang Dylan like Dylan, no one sings Hardin like Hardin&quot;. 

Hardin claimed to be either a distant relative of or direct descendant of John Wesley Hardin, the 19th century outlaw, and it has been said that this provided the inspiration for Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;.

After his death, there was considerable reflection on his impact. Writers said that, along with Leonard Cohen, he was the only musician who could rival Bob Dylan in composing &quot;deeply moving love songs&quot; however critics also noted that he never gained the attention he deserved and by the time he died, not one of his albums was still in print. Jon Marlow writing in the &quot;Miami News&quot; said he was not about to &quot;glorify yet another dead junkie&#x27;s lifestyle&quot; but held that the &quot;Tim Hardin Memorial&quot; album is an &quot;unheralded but still beautiful record of 12 songs that deserve your attention and money ... and has nothing to do with dead hero worship ... it&#x27;s simply here to remind us that via his first two albums Tim Hardin made a lot of promises he couldn&#x27;t keep&quot;. Another reviewer wrote of the memorial album that it &quot;firmly establishes him as an enduring and influential artist&quot;. Though his excesses came under scrutiny, one reviewer noted that &quot;few people who have ever heard the poignant, often lonely, tone of [his] body of work would dispute the suggestion that he was one of the most affecting singer-songwriters of the modern pop era&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Weekly&quot; said&#x27; that his life showed that drugs, alcohol and creativity were not a long lasting or positive partnership, with the writer concluding: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Tim Hardin was ever really sure how good he was and he went from arrogance to despair, conscious of the promises he couldn&#x27;t keep ... [He is] ... gone, but the songs aren&#x27;t and they will last&quot;.

<text>In molecular biology, an amplicon is a piece of DNA or RNA that is the source and/or product of amplification or replication events. It can be formed artificially, using various methods including polymerase chain reactions (PCR) or ligase chain reactions (LCR), or naturally through gene duplication. In this context, &quot;amplification&quot; refers to the production of one or more copies of a genetic fragment or target sequence, specifically the amplicon. As it refers to the product of an amplification reaction, &quot;amplicon&quot; is used interchangeably with common laboratory terms, such as &quot;PCR product.&quot;

Artificial amplification is used in research, forensics, and medicine for purposes that include detection and quantification of infectious agents, identification of human remains, and extracting genotypes from human hair.

Natural gene duplication plays a major role in evolution. It is also implicated in several forms of human cancer including primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. In this context the term &quot;amplicon&quot; can refer both to a section of chromosomal DNA that has been excised, amplified, and reinserted elsewhere in the genome, and to a fragment of extrachromosomal DNA known as a double minute, each of which can be composed of one or more genes. Amplification of the genes encoded by these amplicons generally increases transcription of those genes and ultimately the volume of associated proteins.

==Structure==
Amplicons in general are direct repeat (head-to-tail) or inverted repeat (head-to-head or tail-to-tail) genetic sequences, and can be either linear or circular in structure. Circular amplicons consist of imperfect inverted duplications annealed into a circle and are thought to arise from precursor linear amplicons.

During artificial amplification, amplicon length is dictated by the experimental goals.

==Technology==

Analysis of amplicons has been made possible by the development of amplification methods such as PCR, and increasingly by cheaper and more high-throughput technologies for DNA sequencing or next-generation sequencing, such as ion semiconductor sequencing, popularly referred to as the brand of the developer, Ion Torrent.

DNA sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing have made it possible to study amplicons in genome biology and genetics, including cancer genetics research, phylogenetic research, and human genetics. For example, using the 16S rRNA gene, which is part of every bacterial and archaeal genome and is highly conserved, bacteria can be taxonomically classified by comparison of the amplicon sequence to known sequences. This works similarly in the fungal domain with the 18S rRNA gene as well as the ITS1 non-coding region.

Irrespective of the approach used to amplify the amplicons, some technique must be used to quantitate the amplified product. Generally, these techniques incorporate a capture step and a detection step, although how these steps are incorporated depends on the individual assay.

Examples include the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Assay (RT-PCR), which has the capacity to recognize HIV in plasma; the HIV-1 QT (NASBA), which is used to measure plasma viral load by amplifying a segment of the HIV RNA; and transcription mediated amplification, which employs a hybridization protection assay to distinguish &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; infections. Various detection and capture steps are involved in each approach to assess the amplification product, or amplicon. With amplicon sequencing the high number of different amplicons resulting from amplification of a usual sample are concatenated and sequenced. After quality control classification is done by different methods, the counts of identical taxa representing their relative abundance in the sample.

==Applications==

PCR can be used to determine sex from a human DNA sample. The loci of Alu element insertion is selected, amplified and evaluated in terms of size of the fragment. The sex assay utilizes AluSTXa for the X chromosome, AluSTYa for the Y chromosome, or both AluSTXa and AluSTYa, to reduce the possibility of error to a negligible quantity. The inserted chromosome yields a large fragment when the homologous region is amplified. The males are distinguished as having two DNA amplicons present, while females have only a single amplicon. The kit adapted for carrying out the method includes a pair of primers to amplify the locus and optionally polymerase chain reaction reagents.

LCR can be used to diagnose tuberculosis. The sequence containing protein antigen B is targeted by four oligonucleotide primers—two for the sense strand, and two for the antisense strand. The primers bind adjacent to one another, forming a segment of double stranded DNA that once separated, can serve as a target for future rounds of replication. In this instance, the product can be detected via the microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA).

<doc id="914099" wikidata="Q213523" url="?curid=914099" title="Quattrocento">
<text>The cultural and artistic events of Italy during the period 1400 to 1499 are collectively referred to as the Quattrocento (, , ) from the Italian word for the number 400, in turn from , which is Italian for the year 1400. The Quattrocento encompasses the artistic styles of the late Middle Ages (most notably International Gothic), the early Renaissance (beginning around 1425), and the start of the High Renaissance, generally asserted to begin between 1495 and 1500.

==Historical context==
After the decline of the Western Roman Empire in 476, economic disorder and disruption of trade spread across Europe. This was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages, which lasted roughly until the 14th century, when trade increased, population began to expand and the people regained their authority.

In the late Middle Ages, the political structure of the European continent slowly coalesced from small, turbulent fiefdoms into larger, more stable nation states ruled by monarchies. In Italy, urban centers arose, populated by merchant and trade classes able to defend themselves. Money replaced land as the primary measure of wealth, and increasing numbers of serfs became freedmen. The changes in Medieval Italy and the decline of feudalism paved the way for social, cultural, and economic changes.

The Quattrocento is viewed as the transition from the Medieval period to the age of the Italian Renaissance, principally in the cities of Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice, Naples. The period saw the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire, and it has been compared with the Timurid Renaissance which unfolded at the same time in Central Asia.

==Development of Quattrocento styles==

Quattrocento art shed the decorative mosaics typically associated with Byzantine art along with Christian and Gothic media, as well as styles in stained glass, frescoes, illuminated manuscripts and sculpture. Instead, Quattrocento artists incorporated the more classic forms developed by classical Roman and Greek art.

==List of Italian Quattrocento artists==
Since the Quattrocento overlaps with part of the Renaissance, it would be inaccurate to say that a particular artist was Quattrocento &quot;or&quot; Renaissance. Artists of the time probably would not have identified themselves as members of a school or period.

<text>Albion is an inner north-eastern suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Albion had a population of 3,446 people.

== Geography ==

Albion is bounded by Wooloowin in the north, Ascot in the east, Newstead in the south, and Windsor to the west, with Breakfast Creek defining the suburb border in its south and south-west. Sandgate Road, a major road on the north side of Brisbane, runs through the middle of the suburb. A variety of housing styles, from former workers&#x27; cottages through to modern brick homes and unit blocks, can be found in Albion.

Breakfast Creek is a neighbourhood within the west of the suburb ().

== History ==
The name &quot;Breakfast Creek&quot; comes from &quot;Breakfast Point&quot;, which was a rocky point of the downstream side of the creek and was named by explorer John Oxley during his 1823 exploration of the Brisbane River.

In 1860 John Petrie opened a quarry at Albion. It occupied a site that today would be in the vicinity of Comus Avenue, loosely bounded by Crosby Road to the south, Morgan Street to the east, Tower Street to the north, and Lapraik Street to the west ().The name &quot;Albion&quot; comes from the Albion Hotel built by Thomas Hayseldon (also written as Hazeldon), which was so called because the white wall of Petrie&#x27;s quarry reminded Hayseldon of the England&#x27;s white cliffs (Albion being an old name for England, from the Latin &quot;albus&quot; meaning white). From 1866 to 1870, the proprietor was Edward Hudson. The low lying parts of Albion came into the limelight when a swampy area near the Breakfast Creek was designated as the racecourse. In 1885, it became the headquarters of the Smithfield Pony Club and later in 1895 of the Albion Park Racecourse. Many Chinese migrants settled here and the Temple of the Holy Triad was built on the Higgs Street for the local community in 1885-86. 

On 17 May 1890 the Breakfast Creek Hotel opened. The French Renaissance style hotel has remained a prominent landmark to this day, despite going under water in floods in 1893, 1898, 1974, 2011 and 2022.

Breakfast Creek Sportsground was officially opened on Saturday 31 August 1899. Proprietors Michael Gannon and Andrew Lang Petrie drained a swamp to create a major recreational facilities, occupying of a site. The facilities included a racetrack, trotting track, bicycle track, fields for various sports such as cricket, football, tennis and lacrosse, a skating rink, and a lake for model boats. There were grandstands and a ballroom and concert hall with supper rooms and refreshment areas with 100 electric lights. There was a &quot;switchback railway&quot; (a roller-coaster) with four falls. The Sportsground is now the Albion Park Paceway.

Breakfast Creek State School opened on 7 July 1890 and closed on 11 August 1961. It was on the western side of Agnew Street (). Following the closure of the school, the Fortitude Valley Opportunity School relocated into the buildings, becoming Newstead Opportunity School. Later it was renamed Newstead Special School (). It closed in 1996.

On 27 September 1880, eight blocks of land of &quot;Corunna Estate&quot; were advertised for auction by John Cameron.

In 1883, a Baptist church opened in Albion.

In December 1884, &quot;Albion Township Estate&quot; made up of ninety-one allotments of land were advertised to be auctioned by Arthur Martin &amp; Co., Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction shows the proximity of the estate to Breakfast Creek.

On 28 October 1899, sixty allotments of land of Albion Hill estate, being re-subdivisions 1 to 60, of subdivision of section 3 of portion 162, Parish of Enoggera, were advertised for auction by Isles, Love &amp; Co. The advertising map states the estate&#x27;s proximity to Albion Train Station, with 76 trains daily. The land for sale was situated between Camden St, Albion, and Ford St and Old Sandgate Rd (now Bonney Ave), Clayfield.

A first meeting of the Church of Christ took place on 1 January 1911 at the Good Templar&#x27;s hall in Stoneleigh Street involving members of the Ann Street congregation. On 6 January 1912 a separate congregation was formed in Albion. Land for a church was bought at 86 McLennan Street in 1913 and the church was opened in 1915. In 1929, the Albion congregation helped to establish a new congregation in Kedron. In 1992, the Albion and Kedron congregations merged to form the Brisbane North congregation and the Albion church was sold in 1997.

On 5 December 1926, Roman Catholic Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone for St Columban&#x27;s College at &quot;Highlands&quot; at 451 Sandgate Road (). The school officially opened on Sunday 29 January 1928 as a school for boys operated by the Christian Brothers. In 1985 the Christian Brothers passed the management of the college to the Brisbane Diocese. This triggered a number of changes, a phasing out the primary school to focus on secondary schooling. In 1996 the school accepted enrolments from girls and in 1997 the school relocated to Caboolture. The Albion site has been redeveloped as The Clayfield retirement village but three heritage buildings have been retained on the site: Highlands, O&#x27;Driscoll Hall and Whytecliffe.

On 25 February 1929, a plan was drawn up for the Frank Mann Estate, Subdivisions 1 to 4 of Resubdivision 1 and Subdivision 1 of Resubdivision 1 of Subdivision A of Resubdivision 2 of Subdivisions 51 to 54 of Portion 149, Parish of Enoggera, County of Stanley.

In 2013, the A$29m state-of-the-art Bupa National Cricket Centre was completed at the Allan Border Field. The centre now serves as the headquarters of the Queensland Cricket Association.

The Brisbane bid for the 2032 Summer Olympics includes building an athlete&#x27;s village in Albion. Another is proposed at the Gold Coast.

<text>The Trachypachidae (sometimes known as false ground beetles) are a family of beetles that generally resemble small ground beetles, but that are distinguished by the large coxae of their rearmost legs. There are only six known extant species in the family, with four species of &quot;Trachypachus&quot; found in northern Eurasia and northern North America, and two species of &quot;Systolosoma&quot; in Chile and Argentina. They were much more diverse in the past, with dozens of described species from the Mesozoic.

Their habits are similar to those of the ground beetles; they are usually found in the leaf litter of conifer forests, and are thought to be mostly predators and scavengers, active during the day (diurnal).

According to entomologist George Ball, &quot;the most interesting thing about this small family is its uncertain phylogenetic relationships&quot;; it has previously been classified as a subfamily of Carabidae, and as a family been placed in several different positions relative to other beetle families. Recent molecular phylogenies have recovered as the sister group to the clade Carabidae+Cicindelidae as part of the Adephaga subgroup Geadephaga. The earliest fossils known of this family are of the genera &quot;Petrodromeus,&quot; &quot;Permunda&quot; and &quot;Apermunda&quot; from the Permian-Triassic boundary of Russia around 252 million years ago. Fossil genera of the family are classified in the subfamily Eodromeinae, while the two modern genera are placed in the subfamily Trachypachinae. The two subfamilies are distinguished by the shape and position of the sclerites that are jointed to the mesocoxae (the section where the middle pair of legs joins the body).

<doc id="914114" wikidata="Q725726" url="?curid=914114" title="Sean Avery">
<text>Sean Christopher Avery (born April 10, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. During his career in the National Hockey League (NHL), he played left wing for the Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Kings, New York Rangers, and Dallas Stars, gaining recognition for controversial and disrespectful behaviour both on and off the ice. His agitating playing style led to multiple teams waiving him and to having a contract terminated. He led the league in penalty minutes twice, during the 2003–04 and 2005–06 NHL seasons.

After retiring in 2012, Avery focused full-time on working in the creative industry. He has worked in fashion as an intern at &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, as a model, as an actor, and as a restaurateur. Avery&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Ice Capades: A Memoir of Fast Living and Tough Hockey&quot;, was published by Blue Rider Press in 2017. He has hosted a weekly podcast, &quot;No Gruffs Given with Sean Avery&quot; since December 2019.

==Early life==
Avery was born in North York, Ontario, the son of Al and Marlene Avery, both teachers. He grew up in Pickering, Ontario, where he attended Dunbarton High School. He has a younger brother named Scott.

==Playing career==

===Junior league (1996–2000)===
Prior to joining the NHL, Avery played for the Owen Sound Platers and the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL).

===Detroit Red Wings (2001–2003)===
Avery was signed by the Detroit Red Wings as a free agent in 1999. He played one final season in the OHL before turning professional in 2000 with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL). Avery first played in the NHL during the 2001–02 season, playing 36 games with the Red Wings and 36 in the minors. The Red Wings went on to win the Stanley Cup that season but Avery did not play in the playoffs nor did he play the required 41 games to get his name engraved on the Cup.

Midway through the 2002–03 season, Avery was traded to the Los Angeles Kings, along with defenseman Maxim Kuznetsov and two draft picks for Mathieu Schneider. He finished the season with 15 points in 51 games.

===Los Angeles Kings and NHL lockout (2003–2007)===

In 2003–04, Avery played 76 games for the Kings, scoring 9 goals to go along with 19 assists. He also led the NHL in penalty minutes with 261.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Avery briefly played in the Finnish Elite League with the Lahti Pelicans, and in the United Hockey League for the Motor City Mechanics. Along with 149 penalty minutes in just 16 games, he tallied 26 points for the Mechanics, including two hat tricks, making him the first player in Mechanics history to record two hat tricks in one season. Several players spoke publicly of their dissatisfaction with the NHL Players&#x27; Association’s leadership during the lockout, including Avery, who publicly blamed NHLPA president Bob Goodenow for wasting an entire season with a battle that alienated fans and yielded few results.

Avery led the league in penalty minutes for the second consecutive season in 2005-06, with 257. With three games remaining, the Kings unofficially suspended Avery for the remainder of the season after he refused to do a drill in practice. Nevertheless, the team re-signed him to a one-year deal.

During his time with the Kings, Avery has been said to have mocked Dustin Brown about his lisp. Former Kings&#x27; teammate Ian Laperrière said it &quot;was bullying, like you might see in high school&quot;. But according to other players and coaches, Brown&#x27;s lisp was not Avery&#x27;s target; Brown&#x27;s then girlfriend, now wife, Nicole was. Avery did not think Nicole was glamorous enough to be a &quot;girlfriend of a hockey player in Hollywood.&quot;

===New York Rangers (2007–2008)===

On February 5, 2007, in the middle of the 2006–07 season, Avery was traded to the New York Rangers. After joining the Rangers, he scored 20 points in 29 games to help the team complete a 17–4–6 end-of-season run to qualify for the playoffs. On March 17, Avery recorded a single-game career-high four points (one goal and three assists) against the Boston Bruins in a 7–0 victory. Avery played in his first career playoff game on April 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers, recording his first playoff points with a goal and an assist.

On August 1, 2007, Avery, as a restricted free agent, earned an arbitration award of $1.9 million for the 2007–08 season, which the Rangers accepted.

On February 16, 2008, in a game against the Buffalo Sabres, Avery scored 10 seconds into the game, setting a record for fastest goal scored by a Ranger on home ice.

===Dallas Stars (2008)===
Avery signed a four-year, $15.5 million contract with the Dallas Stars on July 2, 2008. In December 2008, the NHL suspended Avery after he made controversial remarks about other players dating his ex-girlfriends. After serving a six-game suspension and completing a counseling program, the Stars placed Avery on waivers on February 7, 2009.

===Return to the Rangers (2009–2012)===

After clearing waivers on February 9, 2009, Avery was assigned to the Hartford Wolf Pack, the Rangers&#x27; AHL affiliate, although he remained a member of the Stars organization (that season, the Stars had no AHL affiliate). On March 2, Avery was placed on re-entry waivers by Dallas, and claimed by the Rangers the following day. On January 5, 2010, in a game against the Stars, his former team, Avery recorded one goal and three assists.

On October 4, 2011, the Rangers waived Avery. He later cleared waivers and re-joined the Rangers for their November 5 game against the Montreal Canadiens. After being a healthy scratch for nine games, Avery was once again placed on waivers on December 30, 2011. Since no NHL team claimed him, he returned to the AHL&#x27;s Connecticut Whale. His last game played with the Whale was on January 27, 2012. He was left off the Whale&#x27;s Clear Day list of players eligible to play for the remainder of the AHL season submitted on March 5, and told to no longer report to games or practices.

On March 12, 2012, Avery retired. He announced his retirement on &quot;Watch What Happens Live&quot; with host Andy Cohen.

===Orlando Solar Bears (2022)===

On February 23, 2022, the Orlando Solar Bears of the ECHL signed Avery to a standard player contract, putting him on the team&#x27;s reserve list. Orlando released him two days later. Avery did not play in a game for the Solar Bears.

==Controversies and bullying==
During and after his hockey career, Avery has been involved in a number of controversies. Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said he traded Avery during the 2002–03 season because he did not live up to the standards of an NHL professional. Avery has bullied people including Dustin Brown and Martin Brodeur.

===Leukemia comment===
In November 2007, Howard Berger, a reporter for Toronto radio station FAN 590 stated that an unnamed Rangers player had accused Avery of commenting about Toronto Maple Leafs player Jason Blake&#x27;s battle with leukemia, prior to a pregame confrontation between Avery and Toronto&#x27;s Darcy Tucker. Avery, who denied the allegation, received an NHL-maximum $2500 fine, and Tucker received a $1000 fine.

===The Avery Rule===

During Game 3 of the 2008 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals against the New Jersey Devils, Avery turned his back on the play to face and screen Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur during a two-man advantage on the power play. He waved his hands and stick in front of Brodeur to distract him and block his view. The puck was later cleared out of the Devils&#x27; zone but on the second Rangers offensive attack, Avery scored a power play goal.

Avery spent the initial part of the play facing Brodeur while ignoring the puck, with his back to the play (normally, the player screening the goaltender is facing the play). The following day, the NHL issued an interpretation of the league&#x27;s unsportsmanlike conduct rule to cover actions such as the one employed by Avery, which would now result in a minor penalty. This became known colloquially as &quot;The Avery Rule&quot;.

Avery&#x27;s tactics during that series earned multiple power plays, and he scored in each of the first three games. The Rangers won the series in five games.

===Heckling incident===

On November 1, 2008, following a game with the Stars against the Boston Bruins, Avery was accused of shouting obscenities at a fan who had been heckling him during the game. A report of complaint was filed with the NHL, but no action was taken.

===&quot;Sloppy seconds&quot; comment===
On December 2, 2008, prior to the Stars&#x27; morning skate in preparation for a game against the Calgary Flames, Avery approached the assembled reporters in the dressing room and stated, &quot;I just want to comment on how it&#x27;s become like a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall in love with my sloppy seconds. I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about, but enjoy the game tonight.&quot; At the time, two of Avery&#x27;s ex-girlfriends were dating fellow NHL players: actress Elisha Cuthbert was dating Flames defenceman Dion Phaneuf, and model Rachel Hunter was dating Kings centre Jarret Stoll.

Within hours, the NHL suspended Avery indefinitely for &quot;conduct detrimental to the league or the game of hockey&quot;. His comments were met with near-unanimous condemnation by the Stars organization, fellow players, and fans alike. Stars owner Tom Hicks said that the team would have suspended Avery had the NHL not acted first. Avery apologized the next day, calling his actions &quot;inappropriate&quot; and &quot;a bad attempt to build excitement for the game&quot;.

On December 5, the NHL fixed Avery&#x27;s suspension at six games, retroactive to the December 2 game against the Flames. He agreed to undergo anger management counselling due to what the NHL called unacceptable and antisocial behaviour. Commissioner Gary Bettman noted that both he and league disciplinarian Colin Campbell had warned Avery several times before about his behaviour
. On December 14, after the last game of Avery&#x27;s suspension, the Stars announced that Avery would not return to the team. One factor in the Stars decision was that coach Dave Tippett and several of the players, including Mike Modano and Marty Turco, let it be known they weren&#x27;t willing to take him back on the team. Tippett had warned Avery not to talk to the media about his former girlfriends, and was outraged when he did so. According to TSN&#x27;s James Duthie, Avery&#x27;s teammates soured on him not long after he arrived. The &quot;sloppy seconds&quot; incident was the last straw, and Hicks had been actively looking to cut ties with him while the suspension was underway.

===Feud with John Tortorella===
Prior to his second stint with the Rangers, Avery had been called out on numerous occasions by then TSN commentator, future Rangers coach, and Stanley Cup winner John Tortorella, who is noted for his no-nonsense behaviour with his players and the press. After rejoining the Rangers, Avery’s relationship with Tortorella was uneasy, although in Avery&#x27;s book he reports there were moments of mutual admiration. Nearly a year after Avery retired, on March 30, 2013, following the Rangers’ second consecutive shutout loss, Avery posted on his Twitter account about his former coach, &quot;Fire this CLOWN, his players hate him and wont play for his BS.&quot; On May 29, 2013, after the Rangers lost to the Bruins in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Tortorella was fired.

===Off-Broadway play===
In November 2014, Avery suddenly quit an off-Broadway play he was set to star in, &quot;Negative Is Positive&quot;, two days before the play was set to open. On November 3, Avery abruptly left rehearsals after growing agitated. An understudy filled in for him when the play opened.

===Criminal mischief trial===

Avery used his Instagram account, named &quot;officer_avery&quot;, to try to keep New York City&#x27;s bike lanes clear of obstructions. After ramming his scooter into a minivan blocking a bike lane in New York City&#x27;s West Village, Avery was charged with criminal mischief in 2019. Prosecutors offered him a plea deal that would involve him pleading guilty, paying a fine, and attending anger management classes. In an in-person hearing in April 2022, Avery dismissed his lawyer, chose to represent himself, and declined a bench trial, demanding instead a jury trial. His court date was set for May 23, 2022. This angered Avery, who lives and works in California, and who had demanded a trial on the same day as his hearing. At a pretrial hearing on May 23, Avery attended via FaceTime and was represented by an attorney. He was ordered to appear in person on June 15.

Avery tried to use his podcast to rally supporters to attend his trial, although only two were in attendance. On June 16, the second day of his trial, Avery was convicted of attempted criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. He was ordered to pay a $205 surcharge and was barred from contact with his victims for three years.

==Advertising==

His interest mainly resides with women&#x27;s fashion; of men&#x27;s fashion Avery has said, &quot;You do suits and pants and that&#x27;s about that. Women&#x27;s clothes tell a story. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting to me.&quot;

In 2008, New Line Cinema put into development a film based on Avery’s life, focusing on his status as a professional athlete with an active interest in fashion, including a summer internship at &quot;Vogue&quot;. Stan Chervin was hired to write the script.

<doc id="914116" wikidata="Q144102" url="?curid=914116" title="Myanmar at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Myanmar competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourteenth appearance at the Olympics, although it had previous competed in most games under the name &quot;Burma&quot;. Myanmar, however, did not participate at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal for political reasons.

Myanmar Olympic Committee sent only two women to compete only in archery and weightlifting, respectively. Weightlifting coach U Hla Win was among the officials and coaches who carried their national flags in the opening ceremony.

Myanmar, however, has yet to win its first ever Olympic medal. On August 14, 2004, weightlifter Nan Aye Khine managed to achieve a fourth-place finish in the women&#x27;s 48 kg class, but the International Olympic Committee decided to expel her from the Games when she was tested positive for an anabolic steroid three days later.

==Archery==

One Burmese archer qualified only for the women&#x27;s individual archery. Thin Thin Khaing drew an opponent ranked 70 places ahead of her in the opening round, but made the most of it, managing to make it the closest match of the Games. Down one point with two arrows left, Thin hit a ten and watched her opponent score eight, pulling her ahead. However, her Polish opponent responded with a ten on her final shot to force a tie. On the first tiebreaker shot, both archers shot a nine, which they both repeated on the second shot. On the third shot, Sobieraj hit another nine, but Thin could only manage a seven, which eliminated her.

==Weightlifting ==

Myanmar has qualified a single weightlifter.

<doc id="914118" wikidata="Q161212" url="?curid=914118" title="Greatest Hits II (Queen album)">
<text>Greatest Hits II is a compilation album by the British rock band Queen, released on 28 October 1991. The album consisted of Queen&#x27;s biggest hits between 1981 and 1991, from the UK chart-topper &quot;Under Pressure&quot; to &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.

The compilation &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and is the tenth best-selling album in the UK with sales of 3.9 million copies as of 2014. It is the seventh best-selling album in Germany, the thirteenth best-selling album in France, and the best-selling album by a foreign artist in Finland. Accumulated sales (&quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; and &quot;Classic Queen&quot; for the US and Canada combined) are in excess of 25 million worldwide.

Freddie Mercury designed the crest on the album cover, using the astrological signs of the four members: two Leos (Roger Taylor and John Deacon), one Cancer (Brian May) and one Virgo (Mercury).

==Content==
The compilation contains most of Queen&#x27;s hits from 1981 to 1991. The singles &quot;Body Language&quot;, &quot;Back Chat&quot;, &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot;, &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot; and &quot;Scandal&quot; were omitted for this release. &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot;, &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot; were later included on &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; was released less than a month before the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury and was the last Queen release of any kind while he was still alive. The album was not initially made available in the United States and was replaced with its counterpart &quot;Classic Queen&quot; in early 1992 to capitalise on the band&#x27;s renewed popularity in the country following the inclusion of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; was later made available in the US with its inclusion in two box sets, &quot;Greatest Hits I &amp; II&quot; in 1994, and &quot;The Platinum Collection: Greatest Hits I, II &amp; III&quot; in 2002. On 19 April 2011, Hollywood Records released the newly remastered version of &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; in the United States as an individual album for the first time.

A companion video release entitled Greatest Flix II was released at the same time, but is currently out of print. Most of the videos are now available on the DVD &quot;Greatest Video Hits 2&quot; with the exception of the videos from the 1991 &quot;Innuendo&quot; album.

<doc id="914122" wikidata="Q317209" url="?curid=914122" title="Penny Hardaway">
<text>Anfernee Deon &quot;Penny&quot; Hardaway (born July 18, 1971) is an American college basketball coach and former professional player who is the head coach of the Memphis Tigers men&#x27;s team in the American Athletic Conference (AAC). Hardaway played college basketball at Memphis and 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), where he was a four-time NBA All-Star and a three-time All-NBA Team member as a member of the Orlando Magic. He also played for the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks and the Miami Heat.

==Early life==
Hardaway is the son of Fae Hardaway (born 1951) and Eddie Golden. The name &quot;Anfernee &quot; () was that of a schoolmate of his mother. When she left Memphis to work in Oakland in 1974, she left her son with her mother, Louise. His nickname came as a result of his grandmother&#x27;s calling him &quot;Pretty&quot; with a southern drawl, thus sounding like &quot;Penny&quot;. He wore #1 on his jersey in part because a penny is worth one cent. Hardaway&#x27;s first love was football, but his grandmother did not want him to get hurt. He was raised in the Binghampton neighborhood of shotgun houses in Memphis. As a teenager, Hardaway refereed youth sports at the Memphis YMCA and played on its Jr. Olympic basketball team.

==High school career==
Hardaway grew up playing basketball in Memphis for Treadwell High School where he averaged 36.6 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 3.9 steals, and 2.8 blocks as a senior and was named &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; National High School player of the year. He finished his high school career with 3,039 points.

==College career==
At Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis), Hardaway had to sit out the 1990–91 season with the Memphis State Tigers due to being academically ineligible according to the Proposition 48 regulation. His grades were so low that he was admitted to the university on a special exemption from University President Thomas G. Carpenter. He took the ACT five times with a maximum score of 17.2, with 17.5 being required to be eligible to play in college.

While he was sitting out, Hardaway was robbed at gunpoint outside his cousin LaMarcus Golden&#x27;s house and was shot in his foot by a stray bullet, putting his career in jeopardy. He returned to school while rehabbing his foot when the bullet was removed; that year, he made the Dean&#x27;s List.

In the summer of 1992 Hardaway was selected to the 1992 USA Basketball Developmental Team that scrimmaged daily against the 1992 Olympic Team. Hardaway was teammates with Chris Webber, Bobby Hurley, Jamal Mashburn, Rodney Rogers, Eric Montross, Grant Hill, and Allan Houston.

Hardaway returned for his junior season (1992–93) and bettered his numbers from the previous season. He averaged 22.8 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 6.4 apg, 2.4 spg, and 1.2 bpg. He accumulated two triple doubles. He was again named an All-American. He also was a finalist for the Naismith College Player of the Year and the John R. Wooden Award that are annually given the most outstanding player in college basketball.

Hardaway achieved a 3.4 cumulative GPA, but passed up his senior season to enter the 1993 NBA Draft. In 1994, Memphis State retired his jersey number, 25, Hardaway&#x27;s number while playing for the Tigers. He returned to the University of Memphis in May 2003 and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in professional studies, ten years after leaving school early to turn pro.

Hardaway was named #5 on the list of top 100 modern college point guards by collegehoopsnet.com. Additionally, he was a leading vote getter on ESPN Conference USA Silver Anniversary Team.

==Professional career==

===Orlando Magic (1993–1999)===

==== 1993–94 season: All-Rookie honors ====
Hardaway was selected by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the 1993 NBA draft (third pick overall), but was traded along with three future first-round picks to the Orlando Magic for the rights to first overall pick Chris Webber. The Magic&#x27;s intent was to draft Webber and pair him with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal until Hardaway – whose desire was to play alongside O&#x27;Neal – requested a second workout to show why he should be their pick. Two days before the draft, Hardaway participated in a pick-up basketball game with several Magic players and local talent and impressed the organization enough to make the draft day trade.

Having played point guard in college while drawing comparisons to Magic Johnson, he started out the season at the shooting guard position as he learned how to run an NBA point from veteran Scott Skiles. By mid-season he took over point guard duties from Skiles. He immediately made an impact on the league, winning the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award at the inaugural Schick Rookie Game. Hardaway helped the Magic to their first playoff berth and first 50-win season. He averaged 16 points, 6.6 assists, 5.4 rebounds per game while his 190 steals ranked 6th in the league. He recorded his first career triple double on April 15 when he registered 14 points, 12 assists, and 11 rebounds against the Boston Celtics. For his efforts he was named to the NBA All-Rookie first team and was the runner-up for Rookie of the Year to Chris Webber.

==== 1994–95 season: First All-Star and NBA Finals appearance ====
During the 1994–95 NBA season, the Magic won a franchise record 57 games while Hardaway averaged 20.9 points, 7.2 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game. He was named a starter in his first NBA All-Star Game and was named All-NBA First Team. The highlight of the playoff run was the second-round defeat of the Chicago Bulls. Along with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, he led his team to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the Houston Rockets. Despite the sweep Hardaway averaged 25.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 8 assists in the series, while shooting 50% from the field.

==== 1995–96 season: 2nd All-NBA First Team selection and surgery ====
An injury to star teammate Shaquille O&#x27;Neal at the start of the 1995–96 NBA season forced Hardaway to take on more of the scoring load during the first few weeks of the season. He responded by leading the Magic to a 17–5 start. He was named NBA Player of the Month for November by averaging 27.0 points, 6.5 assists, 5.8 rebounds, 2.2 steals, and 1 block per game. He was named a starter in the NBA All-Star Game for the second consecutive season while leading the Magic to a franchise record 60 wins. For the season he was named to the All-NBA First Team for the second consecutive year while averaging 21.7 points, 7.1 assists and 4.3 rebounds and capturing 166 steals which was good for 5th in the league. He also finished third in MVP voting. Hardaway was again the only player in the NBA who averaged at least 20 points and five assists and shot 50 percent on field goals during the regular season. The Magic&#x27;s playoff run ended in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual champion Chicago Bulls. In the 12-game playoff run Hardaway averaged 23.3 points, 6 assists, and 4.7 rebounds.

Hardaway later admitted his first serious knee injury was sustained in a 1996 playoff game against Detroit when Joe Dumars hit him in the back of his knee but he played through the pain. He then said he underwent surgery during the off-season and felt that the injury had robbed him of his explosiveness.

==== 1996–97 season: Olympic gold medal and franchise player ====
During the summer of 1996, Hardaway played on the 1996 US Olympic Games Basketball Team, which won a gold medal. Hardaway averaged 9 points, 4.4 assists, 2.8 rebounds, and 1.4 steals in the eight games. His two biggest contributions were in the quarterfinal game against Brazil where he chipped in 14 points and in the gold medal game against Yugoslavia where he scored 17 points.

The departure of O&#x27;Neal during the off-season to the Los Angeles Lakers left Hardaway as the lone star on the Magic heading into the 1996–97 NBA season. Hardaway struggled through an injury-filled season but still managed to be named a starter for the third consecutive time in the NBA All-Star game. During the season, Hardaway, being the team leader, led a coup to fire then coach Brian Hill with only 33 games left during the season. In 59 regular-season games he averaged 20.5 points, 5.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.6 steals per game and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. The Magic managed to make the playoffs with a 45-win season. In the playoffs the Magic fell 0–2 to the Miami Heat in the first round. Hardaway then scored 42 points in game 3 and 41 in Game 4 to force a Game 5 in Miami (becoming the 1st player in NBA history to score 40 points in back to back playoff games when his team scores less than 100 while also being the first player to score 40 points back to back in the playoffs against a Pat Riley-coached team). Hardaway scored 33 points in Game 5 but the Magic fell short. Hardaway finished the playoffs with averages of 31 points, 6 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 2.4 steals, and 1.4 blocks per game. His playoff scoring average finished a close second to Michael Jordan (31.1).

==== 1997–98 season: Knee injury ====
A devastating left knee injury incurred early in the 1997–98 NBA season required surgery and forced Hardaway to miss the majority of the season. Despite injury, he was voted to start the NBA All-Star Game for the fourth straight year, and had six points and three assists in 12 minutes at New York. He played his last game a week after the All-Star game and missed the remainder of the season. In 19 games he averaged 16.4 points, 4 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 1.5 steals.

==== 1998–99 season: Final season in Orlando ====
Hardaway returned during the lockout-shortened 1999 season and managed to play in all 50 regular-season games to lead the Magic to a share of the best regular-season record in the Eastern Conference. He averaged 15.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists, and his 111 steals placed him 5th in the league. The Magic then lost a first-round series to the Philadelphia 76ers in which Hardaway averaged 19 points, 5.5 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2.3 steals. It would prove to be his final season in Orlando.

In the Summer of 1999, at the urging of Phoenix Suns&#x27; point guard Jason Kidd, Hardaway was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Danny Manning, Pat Garrity and two future first round-draft picks.

In 369 regular season games with the Magic, Hardaway averaged 19 points, 6.3 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.9 steals per game. In 45 playoff games he averaged 21.8 points, 6.5 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.9 steals.

===Phoenix Suns (1999–2004)===
Hardaway landed in Phoenix via a sign-and-trade with Orlando before the start of 1999–2000 NBA season to team with fellow All-Star guard Jason Kidd, forming what the Suns labeled BackCourt 2000. Injuries to Hardaway&#x27;s foot and Kidd&#x27;s ankle allowed them to play just 45 games together (33–12 with both in lineup). In 60 games Hardaway averaged 16.9 points, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.6 steals with a 42–18 record. The Suns finished with a 53–29 record and a 5th seed in the Western Conference Playoffs. The ankle injury to Kidd forced him to miss most of the first-round series against the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. Hardaway stepped up and recorded a 17-point, 13-assist, 12-rebound triple-double in a crucial Game 3 win. The Suns disposed of the Spurs in four games. The Conference Semi-Finals pitted Hardaway against his former teammate Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Suns fell short to the eventual champion Lakers in 5 games. Hardaway averaged 20.3 points, 5.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game during the nine playoff games.

The outlook was optimistic heading into the 2000–01 NBA season, but two microfracture surgeries on his left knee forced Hardaway to miss all but four games during the season. In those four games he averaged 9.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals.

Hardaway entered the 2001–02 NBA season healthy and managed to play in 80 regular-season games. Jason Kidd and Chris Dudley had been traded to the New Jersey Nets for new point guard Stephon Marbury, Johnny Newman, and Soumaila Samake. Kidd&#x27;s pass-first style was switched with Marbury&#x27;s shoot-first style which led to Hardaway and Marbury butting heads. Hardaway managed to average 19.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 1.7 steals during the month of November. The team traded for guard Joe Johnson during the season which relegated Hardaway to the bench for the first time in his career. Despite this he averaged 12 points, 4.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.5 steals during the regular season.

Hardaway entered the 2002–03 NBA season coming off the bench. Inconsistent play by Joe Johnson allowed Hardaway to return to the starting lineup early in the season. His steady veteran play was a key component to a team that had young stars such as Marbury, Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, and Shawn Marion. Hardaway did miss 24 games with a hand injury in which the team went 10–14 in his absence. He returned in time to record a 10-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound triple-double on April 9 against the Dallas Mavericks. Hardaway finished the regular season averaging 10.6 points, 4.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.1 steals. The Suns gave the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs a scare in the first round before losing in six games. Hardaway averaged 12.7 points, 6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.2 steals in the series.

The 2003–04 NBA season saw Hardaway shuffle in and out of the Phoenix Suns starting lineup. He was traded to the New York Knicks January 6, 2004, along with Marbury and backup center Cezary Trybański in exchange for Howard Eisley, Maciej Lampe, Charlie Ward, and Antonio McDyess. The Suns also received the draft rights of Miloš Vujanić and two first-round draft picks in the deal. He averaged 8.7 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 2.9 assists in 34 games for the Suns. Phoenix used the cap room that was carved out via this trade to sign free-agent point guard Steve Nash to a huge deal starting in 2004–05.

In 236 regular season games with the Suns he averaged 12.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and 1.3 steals. In 15 playoff games he averaged 17.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 5.1 assists, and 1.8 steals.

===New York Knicks (2004–2006)===
Hardaway and Marbury helped lead the Knicks to the 2004 NBA Playoffs. In 42 regular-season games with the Knicks, Hardaway averaged 9.6 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 1 steal. In 76 total games during the season he averaged 9.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.3 assists. In the playoffs the Knicks lost in the first round to the New Jersey Nets. Hardaway led the Knicks in scoring in two playoff games while averaging 16.5 points, 5.8 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.5 steals in the series.

Hardaway spent most of 2004–05 NBA season fighting various injuries. He averaged 11.9 points, 2.6 assists, and 2.5 rebounds in an 11-game span during the middle part of the season. He finished the season averaging 7.3 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 2 assists in 37 games.

Hardaway played just four games for the Knicks in the 2005–06 NBA season while trying to rehabilitate arthritic knees. He averaged 2.5 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2 assists in those games.

In 83 games for the Knicks he averaged 8.2 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.9 assists.

On February 22, 2006, Hardaway was traded back to Orlando, along with Trevor Ariza, for Steve Francis. Five days later, the Magic waived Hardaway.

===Miami Heat (2007)===
On August 9, 2007, Hardaway was signed by the Miami Heat reuniting him with former teammate Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. With Dorell Wright already wearing number 1, Hardaway wore jersey number 7, marking the first time in his pro career that he didn&#x27;t wear number 1. On December 12, 2007, he was waived by the Miami Heat in order to free up a team spot for free agent Luke Jackson. In 16 regular season games, he averaged 3.8 points, 2.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists &amp; 1.19 steals. His best game of the season was on November 17, with 6–6 shooting for 16 points in a win on the road over New Jersey Nets, 91–87.

==Coaching career==

In 2011, Hardaway took over for his friend Desmond Merriweather as a coach for his middle school alma mater, Lester Middle School, while Merriweather was undergoing treatment for colon cancer. With a goal to have each of his players graduate from college, Hardaway instituted a mandatory tutoring program. He coached the Lester Lions to the West Tennessee State title 58–57, finishing 28–3 for the season.

===Memphis (2018–present)===

Hardaway was hired as head coach by his alma mater, the Memphis Tigers, on March 19, 2018, replacing Tubby Smith. In his first year as head coach, Hardaway led the Tigers to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). He also secured the number one recruiting class in the country with the commitments of number one rated high school player James Wiseman, D. J. Jeffries, who decommitted from Kentucky; Boogie Ellis, who decommitted from Duke; and others. On May 17, 2019, Precious Achiuwa, a top-20 five-star recruit, signed with Memphis. In 2023, Hardaway led Memphis to an American Athletic Conference championship and a berth in the 2023 NCAA Tournament, getting eliminated in controversial fashion to FAU.

==Television and film==
Before Hardaway was drafted, he and future Orlando Magic teammate Shaquille O&#x27;Neal acted in prominent roles in the college basketball feature film &quot;Blue Chips&quot; (1994); Both players portrayed college freshman on the varsity basketball team of a fictional university.

In the mid to late 1990s, Hardaway starred in the Nike advertising campaign &quot;Lil Penny&quot;, featuring an alter ego puppet version of Hardaway which was voiced by comedian Chris Rock.

Hardaway was featured in the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary series film &quot;This Magic Moment&quot; (2016) which focuses on the Orlando Magic teams led by him and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in the mid-1990s.

==Other pursuits==
Hardaway made more than $120 million in his 16-season career. He owns a barbershop and beauty salon in downtown Memphis and a turf business based in Miami.

Hardaway is also known for his efforts to promote sports in Memphis. In 2010, he helped revitalize the Bluff City Classic, a summer basketball league that provides a high level of competition for men and women players from the college, professional, and elite high school ranks. Hardaway also provided funding to build the University of Memphis Sports Hall of Fame. In 2011, Hardaway announced plans for a permanent $20 million multi-sports facility named FastBreak Courts Sportsplex in Cordova. The sporting complex would support volleyball, cheerleading and wrestling, with seven basketball courts, a 2,000-seat arena, rehabilitation clinic and classrooms. It was expected to boost the Memphis-area economy by generating over $14.5 million in annual visitor spending and directly supporting 236 local jobs.

In 2012, Hardaway was announced to be part of an ownership group including Peyton Manning and Justin Timberlake that was to purchase a minority stake in the Memphis Grizzlies.

==Personal life==
Penny has two sons Jayden and Ashton; Jayden plays for his father at Memphis, and Ashton plays for the Saint Mary&#x27;s Gaels. Penny also has two daughters born in 1992 and 1995, both with his former girlfriend from high school. Penny also has a son who was a sophomore in high school in 2017.

Hardaway is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

<doc id="914132" wikidata="Q53422" url="?curid=914132" title="Mardy Fish">
<text>Mardy Simpson Fish (born December 9, 1981) is an American former professional tennis player. He was a hardcourt specialist. He is one of several American tennis players who rose to prominence in the early 2000s.

Fish won six tournaments on the main ATP Tour and reached the final of four Masters Series events: Cincinnati in 2003 and 2010, Indian Wells in 2008, and Montreal in 2011. His best results at Grand Slam tournaments are reaching the quarterfinals of the 2007 Australian Open, the 2008 US Open, and the 2011 Wimbledon Championships. At the 2004 Summer Olympic Games, Fish won the silver medal in men&#x27;s singles, losing the final to Nicolás Massú.

In April 2011, Fish overtook compatriot Andy Roddick to become the American No. 1 in the ATP rankings, reaching a career-high singles ranking of world No. 7 in August 2011. He then played in the year-end tournament for the only time in his career. He retired after the 2015 US Open. In January 2019, Fish replaced Jim Courier as captain of the United States Davis Cup team.

==Early life==
Fish is the son of a tennis teaching professional and a housewife, Tom and Sally Fish. He was born in Edina, Minnesota. In 1984 a Minneapolis TV station ran a profile of Fish, at the age of two, hitting tennis balls from the baseline over the net. In 1986, Fish&#x27;s family moved to Vero Beach, Florida. He attended Vero Beach High School for tenth grade, then moved to Boca Prep in Boca Raton, Florida, for his junior and senior years of high school. He, Andy Roddick, and Jesse Levine all attended Boca Prep International School. During 1999, he lived with Roddick&#x27;s family, and the two played on the same tennis and basketball teams.

==Tennis career==
===Juniors===
As a junior, Fish compiled a 58–25 singles win–loss record (32–19 in doubles), reaching as high as No. 14 in the world in 1999 (and No. 19 in doubles).

===2000–2005===
Fish turned professional in 2000 at the age of 18. He spent his first few years as a pro playing in the Challenger and Futures circuits. He earned his first title on the ATP Tour in 2002 playing doubles in the U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, with Andy Roddick.

Fish&#x27;s career improved significantly in 2003, when he won his first ATP singles title and reached the biggest final of his career in Cincinnati. His singles victory came near the end of the season, when he defeated Robin Söderling to win the Stockholm Open in Stockholm, Sweden. In addition, he defeated fifth-seeded and former world no. 1 Carlos Moyà at the 2003 Australian Open in the second round, 3–6, 7–6, 6–4, 4–6, 6–2. He finished the year ranked no. 20 in the world.

Fish played well in 2004, reaching the finals at the SAP Open in San Jose, California and in the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Fish earned a silver medal having defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero and Fernando González to reach the final. He lost the final in five sets to Chilean Nicolás Massú.

In 2005, Fish injured his left wrist. It eventually required two surgeries, and as a result, he played just 17 matches in the year.

===2006===
Fish was awarded a wildcard in April into the US Men&#x27;s Claycourt Championships. He won the tournament, defeating eighth seed Juan Mónaco, Rainer Schüttler, Vince Spadea, Tommy Haas, and Jürgen Melzer in the final 3–6, 6–4, 6–3.

At Wimbledon, Fish signaled his return to professional status as he reached the third round, defeating fellow American Robby Ginepri and Dutch player Melle van Gemerden. The night prior to his third-round match, he suffered from food poisoning. He could play only one set before retiring against Georgian Irakli Labadze.

===2007===
Fish began 2007 by achieving his best finish at a Grand Slam. Fish reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, losing to his old roommate and doubles partner, Andy Roddick. Fish made waves on the first day of the tournament by knocking off Ivan Ljubičić, the fourth seed, and had an easy win in the third round when his heavily favoured opponent Wayne Arthurs retired in the opening set. Fish had few problems in his first four matches, but lost in straight sets to Roddick. As a result, he moved up by 17 places in the ATP rankings.
===2008===
Fish started off 2008 quite well at the Hopman Cup, an exhibition event in Perth, Western Australia. Partnering with Serena Williams, he won the title. Williams was ill and arrived after the start of the event, but Meghann Shaughnessy filled in for the first match. Fish won against Indian Rohan Bopanna and Australian Peter Luczak, and received a walkover from Czech Tomáš Berdych. Although Fish lost the first doubles match, he and Williams were undefeated in two mixed doubles matches. They qualified as undefeated for the final, where they faced top-seeded Serbians Novak Djokovic and Jelena Janković. Although Fish lost in singles against Djokovic, the Americans again won the mixed doubles match to win the title.

Fish fell to Jarkko Nieminen in the third round of the Australian Open after a code violation caused him to lose his composure.

Fish then went on to make a quarterfinal showing at the 2008 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, before losing to long-time friend and wild-card entry Robby Ginepri.

At the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, Fish defeated world no. 1 Roger Federer in the semifinals in what Fish described as &quot;a great win,&quot; after failing to beat the Swiss player in five previous matches. However, Fish lost in the final to Novak Djokovic, the third seed.

At the French Open, Fish lost in the second round to 25th-seeded Lleyton Hewitt with Fish committing 58 unforced errors, compared to Hewitt&#x27;s twelve.

At Wimbledon, Fish lost in the first round to eighth-seeded Richard Gasquet.

At the US Open, Fish reached the quarterfinals, before losing to Rafael Nadal.

===2009===

Fish won his fifth doubles title, partnering Mark Knowles of the Bahamas at the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis. The next week, ranked as the top seed, he won his third singles title at the Delray Beach International Tennis Championships against first-time finalist Evgeny Korolev.

In the 2009 BNP Paribas Open, Fish received a first-round bye, only to be eliminated in the second round by unseeded Frenchman Jérémy Chardy. However, he captured his sixth doubles title and first ATP Masters Series 1000 title with partner Andy Roddick.

In April, Fish played in the 2009 U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships, but was knocked out in the first round by Björn Phau of Germany. He then played in the 2009 Rome Masters, where he lost in the second round to Fernando Verdasco.

Fish advanced to the third round in Wimbledon men&#x27;s singles, where he fell to Novak Djokovic in straight sets. In doubles, he and partner James Blake advanced to the semifinals, before losing to the defending and eventual champions Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić.

In July, Fish competed in the Davis Cup against Croatia, losing to Marin Čilić in five sets.

On August 30, Fish withdrew from the 2009 US Open, where he was seeded 25th, citing a rib injury.

===2010===
Fish began 2010 by winning the SAP Open in San Jose with doubles partner Sam Querrey. The pair defeated Benjamin Becker and Leonardo Mayer, 7–6, 7–5, in the final. With this win, Fish improves to 7–1 lifetime in ATP World Tour doubles finals. On March 27, Fish knocked his second round opponent Andy Murray out of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, Florida, in straight sets
On June 10, Fish played Andy Murray again in the third round of the Queen&#x27;s tournament in London. Fish won the first set 6–4, but lost the second 6–1. However, during the third set, Fish was leading 3–0, Murray then brought it back to 3–3. Fish then complained to the umpire that it was too dark, and he then walked off the court without talking to Murray. Murray stayed on the court for a few minutes after the incident and said, &quot;He only complained because I was gaining momentum&quot;, and &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t have complained when he was 3–0 up.&quot; The following day, Fish went on to win the third and final set in a 6–4, 1–6, 7–6 victory. He faced Michaël Llodra in the quarterfinals and Feliciano López in the semifinals to reach the final. He lost to compatriot Sam Querrey to finish as runner-up.

At Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Florian Mayer, 6–7, 6–3, 6–4, 6–4. After Wimbledon, he participated in the last grass-court event of the year, the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport. He won his fourth title, and first on grass, over Belgian Olivier Rochus in three sets. As a result, his ranking jumped up to the top 50 at 49. He proceeded to win a second straight title, which was also his second of the year and first on hard courts, at the Atlanta Tennis Championships. It was the first tournament in Atlanta in over a decade, and in the semifinal and final rounds, Fish defeated Andy Roddick (whom he had not beaten in eight consecutive career meetings), who was the top seed, and John Isner, who played collegiate tennis for nearby University of Georgia.

In Fish&#x27;s return to the Western &amp; Southern Financial Group Masters in Cincinnati, he advanced over former world no. 6 Gilles Simon, over world no. 8 Fernando Verdasco, over former world no. 7 Richard Gasquet, and over world no. 4 Murray to reach the semifinals, where he defeated former world no. 1 Andy Roddick, 4–6, 7–6, 6–1. He was edged by world no. 2 Roger Federer, 6–7, 7–6, 6–4, in the final, but jumped into the top 25 in the world rankings.

===2011===
Fish opened his season at the 2011 Brisbane International, falling in the second round to Stepanek, 3–6, 1–6. Fish then fell in the second round to Tommy Robredo, 6–1, 3–6, 3–6, 3–6, at the 2011 Australian Open.

He made the semifinals at his next two tournaments; 2011 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, losing to resurging, eventual champion Juan Martín del Potro, and at the 2011 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships losing to fast-rising Canadian youngster Milos Raonic in three sets.

After a first-round bye in the 2011 BNP Paribas Open, he fell in the second round again to Milos Raonic, 5–7, 4–6. At the 2011 Sony Ericsson Open, Fish found some rich vein of form, collecting wins over Julien Benneteau, Richard Gasquet, and notably reached the quarterfinals by winning against Juan Martín del Potro, 7–5, 7–6, who only a few weeks earlier had defeated Fish in Delray Beach. By defeating del Potro and reaching the quarterfinals in Miami, Mardy Fish overtook Andy Roddick as the highest-ranked American player on the tour. Fish&#x27;s campaign continued, as he upset ATP world no. 6 David Ferrer, 7–5, 6–2, before falling to world no. 2 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals of the Sony Ericsson Open. He entered the top 10 for the first time on April 18, despite not playing, because Fernando Verdasco did not defend his Monte Carlo points.

Fish reached the third round of the 2011 French Open, his best result at the tournament so far. He was beaten by Gilles Simon, 3–6, 4–6, 2–6.

Fish reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon for the first time, after beating the 2010 finalist Tomáš Berdych in straight sets. He lost to world no. 1 Rafael Nadal, 6–3, 6–3, 5–7, 6–4. At the 2011 Farmers Classic on July 31, 2011, Fish faced Ernests Gulbis for the title, having defeated fellow American teenager Ryan Harrison in the semifinals. He finished runner-up to Gulbis, 7–5, 4–6, 4–6. This dropped him to a 6–13 mark in ATP World Tour finals. The following week, he withdrew from Washington, D.C., citing a heel injury sustained during the Farmers Classic final.

In August at the 2011 Rogers Cup, Fish reached his fourth Masters series final, defeating Feliciano López, Ernests Gulbis, Stanislas Wawrinka, and Janko Tipsarević, 6–3, 6–4, in the semifinal. In the final, Fish faced world no. 1 Novak Djokovic, who was looking to extend his season record to 53–1. He lost to Djokovic, 2–6, 6–3, 4–6, in the final, saving three match points to come up from 0–40 in the final game. Fish rose to a career-high ranking of no. 7.

Fish continued his impressive run on the American hard courts with a comfortable 6–0, 6–2 victory in the second round of the 2011 Western &amp; Southern Open against former world no. four Nikolay Davydenko. In the quarterfinal, he defeated Rafael Nadal, 6–3, 6–4. This was Fish&#x27;s first win against Nadal. He faced world no. 4 Andy Murray in the semifinal. Fish lost, 3–6, 6–7, after a thrilling second-set tiebreak. In the 2011 US Open, he advanced to the fourth round by beating German Tobias Kamke and qualifier Malek Jaziri in straight sets in the first two rounds, and South African Kevin Anderson in straight sets with two tiebreakers in the third round. Fish was subsequently eliminated in the fourth round of the tournament by world no. 11 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

He reached the semifinals in Tokyo in October, defeating Ryan Harrison, Ernests Gulbis, and Bernard Tomic, before falling to Rafael Nadal.

He played for the first time in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, but was eliminated in the round-robin stage.

===2012===
Fish went down in the second round of the 2012 Australian Open to Colombian Alejandro Falla. He made it to the third round of Indian Wells, before being defeated by Australian Matthew Ebden.

He reached the quarterfinals in Miami, but was defeated by Juan Mónaco, 1–6, 3–6.
Citing fatigue, he did not play any of the European clay-court season and withdrew from the 2012 French Open. What he did not tell the media until later is that immediately after his last match in Miami, he was taken to the hospital with severe cardiac arrhythmia. On May 23, he underwent a cardiac catheter ablation in Los Angeles to correct faulty electrical connections in his heart, in which those spots were cauterized in order to prevent short circuiting. He later stated that his condition had made it hard for him to sleep, and his heart felt like it was going to burst out of his chest. His condition was also very difficult mentally and emotionally, with periods when he could not stand to be alone.

Fish&#x27;s first tournament back was the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, where he was seeded 10th. His run at Wimbledon was cut short when he lost to fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth round in four sets.

Fish did not compete in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He instead played at the Citi Open in Washington, D.C., where he was the top seed and reached the semifinals.

In the 2012 US Open Fish was the 23rd seed. He defeated Go Soeda, Nikolay Davydenko, and Gilles Simon before withdrawing for health reasons before his fourth-round match with top seed Roger Federer. In 2015, Fish revealed that he withdrew due to his struggles with anxiety.

Fish did not play on tour for the rest of the season and announced before the end of the year that he would not play in the Australian Open.

===2013–2015===
Mardy&#x27;s first tournament of the 2013 season was Indian Wells in March. He received a bye to the second round and defeated qualifier Bobby Reynolds in three sets. He lost in the third round against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Fish did not play an ATP match again until Atlanta in July. In his first tournament back, he lost in the first round to Michael Russell in a hard-fought match. In Washington, D.C. the following week, he won his first match against Matthew Ebden, before being downed by Julien Benneteau. He also played doubles in this event, teaming with Radek Štěpánek and making it to the final, where he again lost to Benneteau, teamed with Nenad Zimonjić. After winning his first-round match in Winston-Salem, he retired in the third set against Jarkko Nieminen, citing heat stroke. The next day, he announced that he would not be playing the US Open.

Fish did not play on Tour during 2014, due to an anxiety disorder. In June 2014 Fish had a cardiac catheter ablation operation to correct misfiring electric pulses in his heart. He made a return to competitive tennis in February 2015 at the Tennis Championship of Dallas, competing with Mark Knowles in the doubles tournament. He also received a protected ranking for the Indian Wells Masters, but lost in the first round to Ryan Harrison.

Fish appeared again on tour in July 2015 in Atlanta, but again lost in the first round of singles. Playing doubles with Andy Roddick, he won his first-round match. He also won his first-round match of doubles in Washington, D.C., partnering Grigor Dimitrov, but they conceded a walkover in the second round. In Cincinnati, Fish won his first singles match since 2013 against Victor Troicki. However, he faced Andy Murray in the second round, and lost in straight sets, with a tiebreak in the second set. He also teamed with Tomáš Berdych in doubles, but they lost their first match. He announced that he would retire after the US Open. At the US Open, he defeated Marco Cecchinato in the first round. He lost in the second round in a valiant five-set battle with 18th seed and eventual quarterfinalist Feliciano López.

==World TeamTennis==

Fish has played nine seasons with World TeamTennis starting in 2004 when he debuted in the league with the Hartford FoxForce, followed by two seasons with the Houston Wranglers in 2005 and 2006, two seasons with the Sacramento Capitals in 2012 and 2013, a season with the Washington Kastles in 2016, and most recently, three years with the New York Empire in 2017, 2018, and 2019. It was announced that he would join the New York Empire during the 2020 WTT season that began July 12 at The Greenbrier.

==Equipment and playing style==
Fish endorsed the Wilson BLX Six. One 95 18 by 20 racquet with a hybrid of Wilson Natural Gut and Luxilon ALU Power strings. His grip of choice was Wilson Pro Overgrip. He wears TravisMathew apparel.

His biggest weapons were his strong serve and reliable backhand, and he often won points at net with adept volleying. His most reliable shot was his two-handed backhand, which he could flatten out effectively to end points. His forehand was more inconsistent, though it improved toward the end of his career. In 2010, he dropped over 30 pounds, from 203 to 170. This enabled Fish to become much fitter, faster and maintain longer rallies.

==Personal life==
Fish&#x27;s father, Tom, is a tennis instructor.

Fish married Stacey Gardner, a California attorney and &quot;Briefcase Model&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, in a Jewish wedding ceremony in September 2008 (Gardner is Jewish). Fish&#x27;s friend and fellow tennis player James Blake served as groomsman. He is also good friends with Andy Roddick and Bob and Mike Bryan.

Fish went to Vero Beach High School with country music star Jake Owen, with whom he remains good friends. The two have repeatedly done charity events together in Vero Beach to raise money for their favorite charities.

Fish is a fan of the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Vikings.

Fish had a group of fans called &quot;The Fishheads&quot; who traveled with him and cheered him on during matches:

The setting was center court at Arthur Ashe Stadium yesterday, and the crowd filled only half the seats as Mardy Fish took the court for the second match of the day. But as Fish methodically made his way through a straight-set victory, an odd, and somewhat comical, sight emerged in the otherwise sedate setting.

Perched high in the cheap seats, relatively speaking, were a raucous band of shirtless fans, each one with a letter that collectively spelled out, &quot;Go Fish.&quot; Their heads were adorned with rubber fish heads and there were fins attached to their hands that they slapped together enthusiastically for each point scored by Fish.
Fish is regarded as one of the best celebrity golfers. He is annually among the favorites at the American Century Championship in Lake Tahoe, winning the tournament in 2020 and 2024. He won the Diamond Resorts Invitational in Orlando in both 2016 and 2018. In 2022, Fish received a sponsor exemption to play in the 3M Open, a PGA Tour event in his home state of Minnesota. In 2023 at the American Century Championship, Fish finished second to star basketball player Stephen Curry. On the final hole, a fan heckled Fish while hitting his tee shot, who apparently had money on Curry to win the tournament.

As part of the 2021 Netflix docuseries &quot;Untold: Breaking Point&quot;, Fish shared his story about struggling with anxiety and depression.

<doc id="914133" wikidata="Q600204" url="?curid=914133" title="Milvus">
<text>Milvus is a genus of medium-sized birds of prey. The genus was erected by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799 with the red kite as the type species. The name is the Latin word for the red kite.

The genus &quot;Milvus&quot; has in the past been placed in the subfamily Milvinae but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that such a grouping is polyphyletic for Buteoninae. It is now placed in the subfamily Buteoninae.

==Species==
The genus contains three species.



Allozyme data indicates that the genetic diversity in both black and red kites is rather low. Successful hybridization between &quot;Milvus&quot; kites is fairly commonplace, making mtDNA analyses unreliable to resolve the genus&#x27; phylogeny. Furthermore, there is no good correlation between molecular characters and biogeography and morphology in the red kite due to very incomplete lineage sorting.

The yellow-billed kite is apparently a separate species, as indicated by mtDNA phylogeny showing two supported clades, biogeography, and morphology. The black-eared kite is somewhat distinct morphologically, but is better considered a well-marked parapatric subspecies. The status of the Cape Verde kite is in doubt; while not a completely monophyletic lineage according to mtDNA data, it is still best regarded as a distinct species. Whatever its status, this population is extinct.

A prehistoric kite from the Early Pleistocene (1.8 million–780,000 years ago) deposits at Ubeidiya (Israel) was described as &quot;Milvus pygmaeus&quot;.

<text>Mount Carmel Cemetery is located in Wyandotte, Michigan, in the United States. Established in 1864, Mount Carmel Cemetery is an active cemetery. The original cemetery was holding over 8,000 interments. An additional section of one acre was added in November 2004. The grounds offer a columbarium, traditional, and green burials.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit oversees the cemetery grounds.

==Famous interments==

*Salvatore Giannola. Born in Sicily, Italy- 1889 - died October 2, 1919. Organized crime figure. Brother of Tony Giannola. Assumed control of the family in January 1919. A month after his brother&#x27;s murder, Sam Giannola survived an attempt on his life which killed his brother-in-law Pasquale D&#x27;Anna. Three weeks later, John Vitale&#x27;s son and two others were shot in the lobby of the Wayne County Jail. Sam Giannola was charged with murder but acquitted. After a reluctant peace treaty in May 1919, Giannola attempted to ease himself out of the business, but was shot dead in front of the American State Bank at Monroe and Russell streets on October 2, 1919, by three men, one of them being his personal bodyguard. His funeral was one of the most elegant and heartfelt in Detroit at the time.

*Vito Giannola. Born December 10, 1872 - Died September 17, 1947. Organized crime figure. Older brother to Sam and Tony Giannola. Vito was the lesser of the trio and managed to survive the gang war that took the lives of his brothers, dying of natural causes at the age of 72. Both Salvatore and Vito were a part of the Family of Detroit mafia.</text><links>

<doc id="914145" wikidata="Q19958" url="?curid=914145" title="Batmobile">
<text>The Batmobile is the car driven by the superhero Batman. Housed in the Batcave, which it accesses through a hidden entrance, the Batmobile is both a heavily armored tactical assault vehicle and a personalized custom-built pursuit and capture vehicle that is used by Batman in his fight against crime. Using the latest civilian performance technology, coupled with prototype military-grade hardware—most of which was developed by Wayne Enterprises—Batman creates an imposing hybrid monster car to prowl the streets of Gotham City.

The Batmobile first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939), where it was depicted as an ordinary-looking red car. Its appearance has varied but, since its earliest appearances, the Batmobile has had a prominent bat motif, typically including wing-shaped tailfins. Armored in the early stages of Batman&#x27;s career, it has been customized over time and is the most technologically advanced crime-fighting asset in Batman&#x27;s arsenal, barring the Batplane. Depictions of the vehicle have evolved along with the character, with each incarnation reflecting evolving car technologies. It has been portrayed as having many uses, such as vehicular pursuit, prisoner transportation, anti-tank warfare, riot control, and as a mobile crime lab. In some depictions, the Batmobile has individually articulated wheel mounts and is able to be driven unmanned or can be remotely operated. It has appeared in every Batman iteration—from comic books and television to films and video games—and has since become part of popular culture.

A sentient, talking version of the Batmobile appears in the &quot;Batwheels&quot; animated TV series, voice-portrayed by &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;&#x27;s Jacob Bertrand.

==Comic book publication history==

===DC Universe===
====20th century====

=====Golden Age of Comic Books=====

Batman is shown driving a red car in his debut story in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27. The red car was never mentioned by name as the Batmobile. Although the Batplane was introduced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #31, the name &quot;Batmobile&quot; was not applied to Batman&#x27;s automobile until &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #48 (February 1941). The car&#x27;s design evolved in early Batman stories. It became a &quot;specially built high-powered auto&quot; by &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #30, and in &quot;Batman&quot; #5 (March 1941), it had a bat hood ornament and a darker exterior color. The predominant designs settled on a large, dark-colored body and bat-like accessories such as large tailfins scalloped to resemble a bat&#x27;s wings.

Other bat-vehicles soon followed, including the Batcycle, Batboat, and Robin&#x27;s Redbird.

&quot;Batman&quot; #5 (March 1941) introduced a long, powerful, streamlined Batmobile with a tall scalloped fin and an intimidating bat head on the front. Three pages after its introduction, it was forced off a cliff by the Joker and crashed in the ravine below. An identical Batmobile appeared in the next story printed in the same issue.

=====Silver Age of Comic Books=====

The 1966–1968 television series &quot;Batman&quot; was so popular that its campy humor and its version of Batmobile were imported into Batman&#x27;s comics. The iconic television Batmobile was a superficially modified concept car, the decade-old Lincoln Futura, owned by auto customizer George Barris, whose shop did the work. When the series was canceled in 1968, the comic books became darker and more serious. The comics&#x27; version of Batman abandoned that version of the Batmobile. Its replacement was a simpler model with a stylized bat&#x27;s head silhouette decal on the hood being the only decoration of note. The 1960s TV style Batmobile still appears from time to time in the comic books, most recently in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #850 and in &quot;Batman Confidential&quot;.

=====Bronze Age of Comic Books=====

In the Bronze Age of Comic Books, the source of the cars was explained in &quot;The Untold Legend of the Batman&quot; as the work of stunt driver Jack Edison. Edison had volunteered to personally construct Batmobiles for Batman after being rescued from a burning wreck.

In mid-1985, a special variation of the Super Powers toyline Batmobile appeared in both &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. This design had a full set of front and rear canopies, &quot;Coke-bottle&quot; sides, integrated fins, and generally rounder features, just like the toy. The only difference between this car and its toy counterpart is the nose, which was sometimes drawn as longer and more pointed.

=====Modern Age of Comic Books=====

Beginning in the 1990s, the number of comics featuring Batman mushroomed with spin-off titles, limited series, and graphic novels. At the same time, there was considerable experimentation with styles of illustration. With different illustration styles in so many different books, there was naturally a corresponding diversity of designs for the Batmobile. This has continued with designs for the Batmobile ranging from conservative and practical to highly stylized to outlandish.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Batman has hidden a number of spare vehicles across the city just in case. A Humvee serves as a primary mean of transportation to cross the earthquake-ravaged city during the &quot;Aftershock&quot; storyline, as the primary Batmobile is wrecked by the quake. These vehicles are not as sophisticated or as fast as the Batmobiles, but some of them are armed with non-lethal riot control and combat artilleries and armored to withstand ammunition mounted on military automobile prototypes.

====21st century====
=====2000s=====
In the &quot;&quot; storyline, a double-page spread by Jim Lee shows various Batmobiles (from comics, movies, and all TV series) in storage in the Batcave, reveals that Batman now has more than one of his iconic ground vehicles. In addition, some incarnations of the character, such as &quot;&quot;, establish that Batman has a large ground vehicle fleet of various makes and models as well as utility vehicles to use when the Batmobile would be too conspicuous. In issue 9 of the third volume of &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, Robin and his friends use a Batmobile that he shipped out to San Francisco, hiding the expense &quot;in the Batarang budget&quot;.

The 2008 book &quot;Batmobile Owner&#x27;s Manual&quot;, gives theoretical specifications of the car as if it were a real car. The book states that the Batmobile&#x27;s five-cylinder engine is more powerful than turbine jet engines, and capable of achieving up to .

In the 2009 series &quot; Batman and Robin&quot;, a new Batmobile is unveiled. This model is capable of flight, although is not as maneuverable as the Batwing. It can fire 19 types of projectiles, one of which is a flame retardant non-toxic foam, and features a concussive sonic blast device. This Batmobile was designed and constructed by Bruce Wayne. However, its construction was the source of great frustration to him, as mentioned by Alfred, and thus not finished. In &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #1 it is revealed that Bruce&#x27;s son, Damian Wayne, solved the problem of its inability to fly and completed it.

=====2010s=====

The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given new aesthetics.

In 2016, DC Comics relaunched its comic books once again in DC Rebirth and opted to rebrand the continuity to &quot;DC Universe&quot; in December 2017. While many different models of the Batmobile are seen within the Batcave, the model that is primarily used in DC Universe is a revised version with a more rectangular design and an armored appearance. However, this is not always the case, such as in &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 3) #4, and #5. In the future neo-Gotham, a sleek, flying car version of the Batmobile is primarily used instead.

===Elseworlds===

In &quot;&quot;, the Batmobile is depicted on a two-page spread at the end of the story, with Bruce musing that it was provided to him by the remaining members of the underground movement against the religious dictatorship that rules the world in this timeline.

In &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot;, the Batmobile is presented as a basic open-topped car with a single bat-wing at its rear, similar in design to the original Batmobile in the comics. Batman was forced to abandon the Batmobile after the destruction of Wayne Manor to stop Dracula&#x27;s vampire &#x27;family&#x27; deprived him of a suitable place to keep the car, although Bruce reflects that he no longer needs the car after his transformation into a vampire grants him bat-like wings. However, it is revealed in &quot;Crimson Mist&quot;- the third novel in the trilogy- that the Batmobile survives in the remains of the Batcave, with Alfred briefly hiding behind it to escape Killer Croc during a chase through the cave.

In &quot;&quot;, the Batmobile has been modified into a tank-like armored riot control vehicle, complete with machine guns shooting rubber bullets, a large cannon mounted on the front, and large tank treads in place of tires. According to Batman&#x27;s narration, the only thing that can penetrate its armor &quot;isn&#x27;t from this planet&quot; with the &quot;damnedest alloy surface&quot;. Batman also mentions that it was Dick Grayson who came up with the name. The tank-like vehicle appears to take up two lanes of traffic on a normal road, evidenced when returning from Batman&#x27;s initial fight with the leader of the Mutants, and thus is too big for normal land travel around Gotham. In the scenes prior to Batman&#x27;s last stand with the Joker, Batman uses a motorcycle to traverse the city, using the tank again after the attempted nuclear strike and fires in Gotham, although it is torn apart during Batman&#x27;s battle with Superman. This Batmobile reappeared in &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot; #4, which shows its construction by robots in the Batcave.

In Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot;, the car can convert into a harrier jet and a submarine. Dick Grayson comments that the name Batmobile is &quot;totally queer&quot;. However, in &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, which exists in the same continuity, Grayson was stated as the one who coined the name.

==Cartoons and computer-generated portrayals==
===Animation===
The Batmobile made a brief cameo at the end of &quot;the Looney Tunes Show&quot; episode &quot;Reunion&quot;. Bugs Bunny drove off in it after seeing the Bat-Signal because, in that show, he is secretly Batman. This Batmobile slightly resembles the Golden Age version.

====&quot;The Batman/Superman Hour&quot;====

According to the site BatmobileHistory.com, the Batmobile created for the 1968–1969 Filmation Associates TV series was not strongly based on its immediate predecessor (except for sharing dual rear cockpit canopies with the Barris/Futura Batmobile) or any version in DC Comics publications of the time. Furthermore, Filmation&#x27;s Batmobile featured a long, black body with what is described as a &quot;Coke bottle&quot; profile, with a large, light blue bat emblem set across the hood, which, when a dashboard control was activated, the metal bat symbol folded its &quot;wings&quot; up at its center, forming a barricade/chain cutter. There were no door-mounted bat symbols.

Another departure from the Barris Batmobile was a single windshield and large, elevated bat-fins. Curiously, the car&#x27;s underside was colored light blue, and it appeared to conceal the car&#x27;s chassis except for a motorized panel, from which devices such as the Bat-winch would emerge. It is assumed Filmation&#x27;s Batmobile used this light blue underside color to make the panel and devices easier to see. Additionally, the cockpit seating was a vibrant red, with a dashboard panel using bat accents around an inset monitor screen, among other details. Filmation&#x27;s Batmobile used parachutes, inflatable pontoons, and, in case of damaged tires, vertical and rear-mounted jets to lift and propel the car — which then essentially caused it to function as a high-powered hovercraft. The Filmation Batmobile from &quot;The Batman/Superman Hour&quot; was one of the few Batmobiles not to see adaptations to any DC Comics publications or have any commercially available replicas (toys, diecast cars, plastic model kits, etc.).

====&quot;Super Friends&quot;====

The Batmobile was seen in the early episodes of &quot;Super Friends&quot; was based on the Lincoln Futura design in the live-action TV series starring Adam West. The main difference with the &quot;Super Friends&quot; version was that the car&#x27;s lines were modified substantially for use in animation. The most obvious change was to the car&#x27;s nose, where the hood received a &quot;V&quot; depression that echoed the lower fascia. This was also the first Batmobile (of any medium) to feature yellow bat emblems on the doors. This particular feature would be quickly adopted by the comics.

Beginning with the &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; in 1978, the Batmobile got revamped. This new version was developed to have a more aerodynamic, hard-edged style. In addition, this Batmobile was smaller than its predecessor. It had a sloped nose and flying buttress B-pillars. Features that were carried over from the original &quot;Super Friends&quot; Batmobile were the Bat-mask, low horizontal fins, twin bubble windshields, and blue coloring scheme.

In 1984, &quot;Super Friends&quot; revamped its format (first as &quot;Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show&quot; and then as &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot;) to serve as a tie-in to Kenner&#x27;s &quot;Super Powers Collection&quot;.

====DC animated universe====
The Batmobile made appearances in the various series of the DC animated universe.

=====&quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;=====

The Batmobile in &quot;&quot; combined style elements from various eras to produce a long, low vehicle with square lines, long fins, and a blunt nose with a massive chrome grille that could have been from any time from the 1930s to the 1990s. This version of the Batmobile also vaguely resembled the Batmobile from the first two Tim Burton movies. Despite the obvious presence of the jet exhaust, the show frequently used sound effects from a reciprocating engine for the Batmobile&#x27;s driving scenes. This, plus direct views of the engine (as seen in the episode &quot;The Mechanic&quot;), suggests that the car used a large piston engine for primary power and an auxiliary jet or nitro engine for high-speed acceleration. It also had an armored stationary mode to prevent people from tampering with the car when it was left unattended, though this was not as overt as the &quot;shields&quot; used in the 1989 movie Batmobile. The original Batmobile design had many design variants as well as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s limousine, as seen in &quot;Batman Beyond,&quot; which the producers referred to as &quot;an upside-down Batmobile&quot;. It also made a cameo in the episode &quot;The Call, Part 1&quot;, of the third season of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;.

======Features======
Among the features of the Batmobile were the following:

* smoke and oil dispensers
* wheel slasher hubs
* missile rack
* tear gas dispensers
* ejection seats
* titanium alloy wheels and body panels
* reversible jet exhausts
* shield platings
======Replicas======
Massimo Tonoi is the owner of a &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; Batmobile real-life replica.

=====&quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;=====
The Batmobile was redesigned in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; with its jet engine being most notably absent. This Batmobile design is re-used in &quot;Justice League,&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited,&quot; though it appears somewhat more blue than black in paint color. The vehicle possessed bullet-resistant cockpit windows. If the tire were shredded a replacement tire immediately takes over after discarding the previous.

=====&quot;Batman Beyond&quot;=====

A new flying Batmobile design appears in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; used by the new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made multiple appearances in the future of the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is a radical departure from the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from a bat faceplate on the grille to tail fins resembling bat wings.

This version of the Batmobile is a simple sleek pod with sharp angles and rounded sides. Its interior is a red illuminated single-person cockpit, with computer circuitry and displays visible all around. It is armed with guided immobilizer missiles and grappling cables. Being a &quot;single-seat&quot; by design, it was never meant to carry two people, as shown when Terry&#x27;s friend Maxine was once sitting behind the seat to great discomfort. According to Bruce, the vehicle&#x27;s top speed is Mach 3; however, Terry has never piloted the vehicle at those speeds through Gotham City. It features a drop-down hatch; this allows Terry swift exit/entrance from underneath without having to park the vehicle and get out, allowing him to literally get the drop on his opponents. Like Terry&#x27;s batsuit the Batmobile features a camouflage system rendering it invisible; however, another system consisting of a holographic projector disguises it as a simple garbage dumpster or random car to keep away prying eyes and potential vandals. The vehicle has built-in digital recorders and cameras for collecting audio and visual evidence.

====&quot;The Batman&quot;====

In the animated series &quot;The Batman&quot;, the Batmobile resembled a sports coupe with multiple jet exhaust slits protruding from the back bumper. In the third season episode &quot;RPM&quot;, this Batmobile was wrecked beyond repair, and Batman completed a prototype design that included a Wayne Industries &#x27;EXP&#x27; power generator. This Batmobile was longer and had a lower profile with only one triangular jet exhaust coming from the rear of the car resembling the one from &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;. At the end of the episode, Batman remarks that due to the Batmobile EXP&#x27;s success, it is a &#x27;keeper&#x27;. In the fourth season, the episode &quot;Artifacts&quot; explores Gotham City in the year 2027, looking back from 3027, complete with a new tank-like Batmobile reminiscent of Frank Miller&#x27;s design for the Batmobile in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;.

====&quot;Scooby Doo and Guess Who?&quot;====

The Batmobile makes its appearance in the episode &quot;What a Night, for a Dark Knight!&quot;. It is based on the first live-action television series from 1966 to 1968.

====&quot;Batman: Gotham Knight&quot;====

In the straight-to-DVD animated shorts collection &quot;Gotham Knight&quot;, the Batmobile makes an appearance in the feature entitled &quot;Field Test&quot;. While set in the same continuity as Christopher Nolan&#x27;s films, it is visually a pastiche of the Batmobile as it has appeared in various films. Also, the Batmobile appears in the feature entitled &quot;Working Through Pain&quot;; wherein Alfred arrives to pick up Batman. The Batmobile appearing in this scene seems to be inspired by its appearance in the &quot;1989 live-action film&quot;.

====&quot;Batman: The Brave and The Bold&quot;====

The Batmobile in &quot;Batman: The Brave and the Bold&quot; takes design elements from the Golden Age Batmobiles and the Lincoln Futura. This Batmobile has the ability to transform into other vehicles. The tie in toyline&#x27;s Batmobile shares this feature, transforming from car to jet. On at least one occasion, it has converted into a mecha similar to the Bat-Bots seen in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. In the episode &quot;Game Over for Owlman&quot;, Batman is forced to use a backup Batmobile which resembles a Studebaker.

====&quot;Beware the Batman&quot;====

The Batmobile in &quot;Beware the Batman&quot; is a low and flat F1-like car with a single seated cockpit and pointed nose. The car has horizontal fins flanking a pair of jet engines, large wheels with low-profile tires, as well as a sharply angled canopy. This version, as is common with Batmobiles, seems very durable, with low profile armoring, as throughout the show it has taken shots from rocket launchers without any noticeable damage, stood up to high powered demolition machinery without any visible markings to the point of breaking said machinery, etc. The interior features a voice command system, a video link system, and more, directly routed to the Batcomputer.

====&quot;The Lego Movie&quot;====

In &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; a large six-wheeled version of the Batmobile (which is actually the Batwing transformed by Batman) appears equipped with sub-woofers. It is destroyed during the attack on Cloud Cuckoo Land.

====&quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;====

In &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, multiple versions of the Batmobile from different Batman adaptations appear. In the film, Batman drives the &quot;SpeedWagon&quot; Batmobile, which appears to take inspiration from previous Batmobiles. This Batmobile also uses &quot;atomic batteries&quot;, a feature seen in 1960s depictions. Other Batmobiles appear briefly, including the one from the 1960s television series, Tim Burton films, &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, the Golden Age, Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy, and &quot;&quot;.

The Speedwagon was fault-driven by &quot;Nightwing&quot; (alter-ego of Robin when Batman is missing in the world) combined with the novice skills of Nightwing caused the speedwagon&#x27;s destruction, but at the climax of the movie, Batman, his Bat-family, and former Joker henchmen make a new Batmobile with four detachable vehicles (Bat-Plane for Batgirl, Bat-Assault Vehicle for Bat-Alfred, Bat-Cycle (inspired by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;) for Robin and a proper Batmobile for Batman).

====&quot;Ready Player One&quot;====

The 60s incarnation of the Batmobile appears in the Steven Spielberg 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline. Appearing as part of a race alongside many famous vehicles from pop culture, the Batmobile is destroyed when it is struck by another vehicle and explodes. As it skids out, the skidding sound effect is the same cadence as the &quot;Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na&quot; from the opening credits of the &quot;Batman&quot; TV theme.

====&quot;Batwheels&quot;====
A sentient, talking version of the Batmobile appears in the &quot;Batwheels&quot; children&#x27;s animated TV series, as one of its main protagonists, and has been primarily voice-portrayed by Jacob Bertrand of &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; fame. This version is named, &quot;Bam&quot;, by the Batcomputer, and is the leader of his family and team, The Batwheels.

===Video games===
* In the Sega CD adaptation of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, the Batmobile was controlled during the time bonus stages after missions were completed.
* There are two Batmobile levels in the 2005 video game adaptation of &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. Electronic Arts used the &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot; engine for these levels. Batman has to ram enemy cars off the road which results in a &quot;Takedown&quot; while picking up Nitro boosts along the way that float on the road in holographic bubbles. &quot;Xbox World Australia&quot; called these sequences the highlight of the game. &quot;Cheatcc.com&quot; called them &quot;by far the best Batmobile levels ever featured in a game&quot;.
* In the PlayStation game &quot;&quot;, the player gets the full independence to drive the Batmobile.
* In &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, during the &quot;Batcave: Inner Sanctum&quot; alert/raid, the Batmobile is destroyed by the Armored Robotic Custodian, a sentinel robot that has been taken over by Brainiac.
* In &quot;&quot;, Batmobile appears at the end of Batman&#x27;s Super Move, ramming his opponent.
** In the mobile version, in addition to its appearance in the Super Move, the Batmobile (and the evolved form, Militarized Batmobile) can be obtained as a gear card, granting its user increased health; if equipped by a Batman character, it additionally grants his Super Move increased damage, area effect damage, and invulnerability after using it.
* The 2013 &quot;Batman&quot; arcade game is based around the Batmobile, with players controlling it in vehicular combat missions. Ten different Batmobile designs are available for play, including the designs from the 1960s television series, &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, &quot;Arkham Asylum&quot;, and every &quot;Batman&quot; film up to and including &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;.
* On February 25, 2016, it was confirmed via Twitter that the 2015 game &quot;Rocket League&quot; would be receiving a Batmobile car pack on March 8, 2016, to coincide with the release of &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;.

====&quot;Batman: Arkham&quot; series====
In &quot;&quot;, a version of the Batmobile appears with a design heavily influenced by the one used in the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film and &quot;&quot;. In the game, it is vandalized by Harley Quinn and the Blackgate prisoners. Batman later controls the Batmobile remotely using his utility belt to take Bane into the sea along with it. In &quot;&quot;, the Batmobile appears in the Batcave Predator Challenge Map under re-construction following its tussle with Bane, thus explaining its absence in the rest of the game. In &quot;&quot;, a prototype of the Batmobile is seen in the Batcave under construction by Batman, under the working title &quot;Urban Assault Vehicle&quot;; when scanned in Detective Mode its description reads: &quot;Armored to resist direct collisions and small arms fire. Multiple LTL armaments. Shield tracking profiles reduced thermal/radar footprint. 1.200BHP. 7MPG. Status: Under Maintenance.&quot; After Bane destroyed the Batcave, the prototype fell off the ledge, destroyed, with Alfred under the rubble. The destroyed remains of that early Batmobile could still be seen on the ledge.

In &quot;&quot;, a different version of the Batmobile—Urban Assault Vehicle—retains its classic shape and designs, but is heavily influenced by the ones used in &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;. The car is an off-road vehicle, highly maneuverable, possessing numerous non-lethal deterrents, heavier than a light tank; the ability to absorb impact makes it nearly indestructible and affects anything it collides with in a similar fashion. It can be called to Batman instantly with the press of a button and can eject Batman hundreds of feet in the air to instantly begin gliding. Batman can also control the Batmobile remotely using his Batmobile Remote gadget and it can even support Batman while he is fighting free-flow combat via a Batmobile assisted Special Takedown. Like the Batsuit and gadgets, the Batmobile can be upgraded and even has its own alternate skins (such as one based on the Batmobile from the 1960s TV series). The game also features Batmobiles from other Batman media that appear as DLC and are used in the main game upon the main story&#x27;s completion as well as in special Racing AR Challenges.

=====Technical specifications=====
The &quot;Arkham Knight&quot; Batmobile—Urban Assault Vehicle—has a &quot;Reconfigurable Embedded System&quot;, featuring two modes between which it can transform: pursuit mode and battle mode.

Pursuit Mode is the default &quot;Pursuit and Capture&quot; form used for driving around the city and tackling race tracks that the Riddler has set up. It contains boost and jump mechanisms, non-lethal missiles used to immobilize getaway vehicles and an EMP taser unit to stun criminals and enemy vehicles.

=====Features=====
The driver is positioned centered—faced down; this position offers greater protection to the driver during combat, while reducing any chance of injury whenever Batman uses the ejection seat. The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the player&#x27;s location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, sent to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.

Some enemies will run away at the sight of the vehicle, eliminating the need for Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses. Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities. The Batwing is used in conjunction with the Batmobile to deliver upgrades, while providing real-time surveillance and close air support. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile&#x27;s scanner.

The Batmobile has two modes, which can be switched at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60 mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.

Additional upgrades to the vehicle include an EMP device, which releases an electric pulse used to temporarily stun enemy drones; and the &quot;drone virus&quot;, which allows the player to override the weapon systems of enemy vehicles and cause them to attack each other. The Batmobile can also be controlled remotely, driven in indoor locations, and used in solving the game&#x27;s puzzles, such as lowering an inaccessible elevator with its attached winch.

==Appearances in live-action media and real-world vehicles==

===&quot;Batman&quot; (1943 serial)===

In the 1943 serial film &quot;Batman&quot;, a black 1939 Cadillac Series 75 convertible was used by Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, as well as their secret identities Batman and Robin. (It was driven with the top down as Bruce and Dick, and with the top up when they were in disguise.) Alfred chauffeured the Dynamic Duo in both identities.

===&quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (1949 serial)===
In &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, the 1949 successor to the original serial, the duo drive around in a 1949 Mercury.

===1963 promotional Batmobile===
The first car ever publicly toured as a Batmobile was built several years before the Barris Batmobile of the TV series. It was inspired by DC Comics and was created in 1960 and finished in 1963 by Forrest Robinson of Westmoreland, New Hampshire, using a 1956 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 chassis powered by an Oldsmobile Rocket 324 cubic inch engine and building a handmade custom body.

The car was initially used unpainted for a short time as a daily driver and then later leased by a DC Comic licensee (National Periodical publications then owner of DC Comics licensed the use of Batman characters including the Batmobile to various companies), painted in Batman Colors replete with official Batman decals, and toured as &quot;Batman&#x27;s Batmobile&quot; in several small towns on the East coast of the United States. It was used as part of an advertising program for All-Star Dairy Products which had a Batman dessert product line.

After the TV Batmobile by George Barris was created and replicas were made available for promotional events in late 1966, the first Batmobile was returned to Robinson. Robinson then removed the official Batman decals, repainted it in silver, and again used it as a daily driver for a short time and then sold it. After laying in a field in New Hampshire for almost five decades the very poorly preserved car was sold in 2008 and after going unrestored through a few owners was sold in February 2013.

After a year of work in 2013, the car was restored by expert car restorer Mario Borbon of Borbon Fabrications in Sacramento, California.

===&quot;Batman&quot; (1960s film/television series)===

In late 1965 20th Century Fox Television and William Dozier&#x27;s Greenway Productions contracted renowned Hollywood car customizer Dean Jeffries to design and build a &quot;Batmobile&quot; for their upcoming &quot;Batman&quot; TV series. He started customizing a 1959 Cadillac, but when the studio wanted the program on the air in January 1966, and therefore filming sooner than he could provide the car, Jeffries was paid off, and the project went to George Barris.

What became the iconic Batmobile used in the 1966–1968 live action television show and its film adaptation was a customized vehicle that originated as a one-off 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car, created by Ford Motor Company lead stylists Bill Schmidt, Doug Poole Sr., and John Najjar and their design team at the Lincoln Styling Department.

In 1954, the Futura prototype was built entirely by hand by the Ghia Body Works in Turin, Italy, at a reported cost of US$250,000—the equivalent of approximately US$2.5 million in 2021. The chassis was an early prototype Y-shaped backbone perimeter frame that would go into production on the 1956–1957 Contential Mk II. It made its debut in pearlescent Frost-Blue white paint on January 8, 1955, at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1959, sporting a fresh red paint job, the Futura was featured in the film &quot;It Started with a Kiss&quot;, starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford.

Barris was trying to get Hollywood&#x27;s attention with the Futura, which he had purchased from Ford for the nominal sum of $1.00 and &quot;other valuable consideration&quot;, but aside from its film appearance, the Futura had been languishing in his Hollywood shop for several years. With only three weeks to finish the Batmobile (although in recent years Jeffries says that his car was dropped because he was told it was needed in &quot;a week and a half&quot;, he was quoted in 1988 as saying &quot;three weeks&quot; as well), Barris decided that, rather than building a car from scratch, it would be relatively easy to transform the distinctive Futura into the famous crime-fighting vehicle. Design work was conducted by Herb Grasse, working as an associate designer for Barris.

Barris hired Bill Cushenbery to do the metal modifications to the car and its conversion into the Batmobile was completed in just three weeks, at a reported cost of US$30,000. They used the primer-painted, white-striped car in October 1965, for a network presentation reel. Shortly afterward, the car was painted gloss black with &quot;fluorescent cerise&quot; stripes. Barris retained ownership of the car, estimated to be worth $125,000 in 1966 dollars, leasing it to 20th Century Fox and Greenway Productions for use in the series.

When filming for the series began, several problems arose due to the car&#x27;s age: it overheated, the battery died, and the expensive Mickey Thompson tires repeatedly failed. By mid-season, the engine and transmission were replaced with those of a Ford Galaxie. The most frequent visual influence of this car is that later Batmobiles usually have a rear rocket thruster that fires as the car starts up.

In November 2012 Barris Kustom and George Barris announced the sale of the Batmobile at the Barrett-Jackson car show and auction held in Scottsdale, Arizona. The vehicle fetched $4.2 million on January 19, 2013.

The car was resold for an undisclosed amount and as of August 2016, Dave Anderson in Fairfax, Virginia owns the #1 made from the Futura Concept Car and he also owns the #2 car (the first replica that Barris built).

====Features====
This Batmobile&#x27;s gadgets include a nose-mounted aluminum Cable Cutter Blade, Bat Ray Projector, Anti-Theft Device, Detect-a-scope, Batscope, Bat Eye Switch, Antenna Activator, Police Band Cut-In Switch, Automatic Tire Inflation Device, Remote Batcomputer—radio linked to the main Batcomputer in the Batcave, the Batphone, Emergency Bat Turn Lever, Anti-Fire Activator, Bat Smoke, Bat Photoscope, and many other Bat gadgets. If needed, the Batmobile is capable of a quick 180° &quot;bat-turn&quot; thanks to two rear-mounted ten-foot Deist parachutes. To answer viewer complaints about the parachutes being jettisoned on to the street as litter after deployment, the producers included a parachute pickup crew that is on standby to recover them, completed with a van so labelled. The main license plate seen throughout the series was 2F-3567 (1966). Some changes were made during the run of the series, including different license plates (TP-3567; BT-1 and BAT-1), removal of the Futura steering wheel and substitution with a 1958 Edsel steering wheel, and the addition of extra gadgets such as a net in the trunk, remote-controlled driving, a rear-facing camera under the turbine exhaust port, and the Bat Ram.

====Exhibition====
Barris built two fiberglass copies of the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing. Eventually, the three copies (and the screen-used metal Futura Batmobile) were covered with a black velvet &quot;fuzz&quot; paint, presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies. Later, all three were restored to their gloss black paint job. The three replicas are all based on a 1965–1966 Ford Galaxie. The #1 Barris-built Batmobile sold at Barrett-Jackson Auctions on January 19, 2013, for $4,620,000. The three Barris copies all reside in private collections, including the exhibition drag racing version driven by wheelstanding driver Wild Bill Shrewsberry. This car was built with a dual-quad Holman Moody Ford 427 V8 engine, Art Carr-prepared Ford C6 automatic transmission and 5.14 gears in the rear end. Quarter-mile times were in the mid-12 second range, primarily because Shrewsberry would launch the car in second gear and smoke the overinflated rear tires for show down most of the strip. The &quot;rocket exhaust&quot; was made functional via a tank filled with either gasoline or kerosene which was pumped out the exhaust port and ignited electrically.
* The &quot;#1 Barris-built Batmobile&quot;, built from the original 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car, was purchased by Richard Champagne of Ahwatukee, Arizona at the Barrett-Jackson Auction in January 2013 for $4,620,000. It was subsequently purchased privately by Dr. David Anderson, owner of Batmobile #2, for an undisclosed sum.
* The &quot;#2 Barris-built Batmobile&quot; is owned by Dr. David Anderson of Virginia, and has not been repaired or restored. Original purchase price was $225,000.
* The &quot;#3 Barris-built Batmobile&quot; was purchased and restored by Dennis M. Danzik of Paradise Valley, Arizona. It was reportedly purchased for $600,000. Danzik also owns the majority of the Warner Brothers 1989 Batmobile.
* The &quot;#4 Barris-built Batmobile&quot; is owned by Doug Jackson, and is located in Southern California.
* The so-called &quot;#5 Batmobile&quot;, originally built by Jim Sermersheim (on a 1958 Thunderbird chassis) was owned by George Barris until 1989. It went for sale on JamesEdition in June 2017 for an asking price of $250,000.

====Replicas====
In October 2010, DC Comics authorized Fiberglass Freaks in Logansport, Indiana, to build &quot;officially licensed&quot; 1966 Batmobile replicas. These replicas have been sold to customers in England, Italy, Canada, and across the U.S. One of Fiberglass Freaks&#x27; 1966 Batmobile replicas sold at an RM auction for $216,000. Fiberglass Freaks&#x27; owner Mark Racop has been a 1966 Batman fan since he was two years old, and he built his first 1966 Batmobile replica when he was seventeen.

A replica of the Barris-built, TV Batmobile was displayed alongside two of the later, movie Batmobiles at the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Keswick, Cumbria, England for several years. When the museum owner, a Keswick dentist, took delivery of the original car, he drove it through the streets of the town where it was promptly seized by the police. A hilarious newspaper photo showed the Batmobile being driven away by a uniformed, British &#x27;bobby.&#x27; In 2011 the entire collection was sold to the American collector Michael Dezer for his Miami Auto Museum.
* A replica Batmobile was sold at the Coys Spring Classic Cars Auction on February 27, 2007, at the Royal Horticultural Hall in London. Coys Auctions had said it expected the car to fetch more than £75,000 - the final and closing bid was £119,000, equivalent to US$233,000 at the time.
* A replica of the Barris-built Batmobile is owned by Andreas Ugland. He bought the Batmobile at a London car auction in 2007. Both Batmobile and Batcycle at the London car auction were replicas. It is displayed at the Cayman Motor Museum.
* Hobbyists have built a number of duplicates of the TV Batmobile, sharing sources for parts and assembly kits.
* A functional replica of the Batmobile was finished in 2010 in Arboga, Sweden, for a reality show to be shot in the United States. In 2011, the vehicle, valued to 4 million SEK (more than US$600,000) was reported stolen, and is currently (March 2013) unlocated.

====Other appearances====
* In the 1980 low budget science fiction comedy &quot;Galaxina&quot;, the Batmobile is seen parked on the street of a western styled town on an alien planet with unusual daylight effects.
* In the movie &quot;Rock Star&quot;, Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s character is given to extravagant spending; one of his first purchases is the original Batmobile from the TV series.
* The episode &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest-starred Adam West with the Batmobile at an auto show, with West later driving the car. The later episode &quot;Beyond Blunderdome&quot; featured the Batmobile in a museum of famous cars next to Herbie the Love Bug and a car from &quot;Mad Max&quot;. The latter episode featured a live Batman and Robin in the vehicle, who had both tried poorly to conceal the fact that they were not dummies.
* On an episode of &quot;The Man Show&quot;, a guest won a ride in the Batmobile with Adam West in the &quot;Wheel of Destiny&quot; segment.
* The Lincoln Futura version of the Batmobile has seen in the movie &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot;, driven by Jon Lovitz.
* The Batmobile appears as an Easter Egg in the video game &quot;King&#x27;s Quest II: Romancing the Throne&quot;, accompanied by a version of the 1966 TV theme.
* In 2003, Adam West and Burt Ward reunited for a tongue-in-cheek telefilm titled &quot;Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt&quot; which combined dramatized recreations of the filming of the original series (with younger actors standing in for the stars), with modern-day footage of West and Ward searching for a stolen Batmobile.
* In issue 9 of the comic series &quot;Justice&quot; (February 2007), Batman dons a suit of armor visually influenced by the original Batmobile from the TV series.

===1966 promotional Batmobile===

When the TV spin-off film &quot;Batman&quot; was released in 1966, the studio decided to recreate the Batmobile for promotional purposes in the UK. For this purpose, a 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air, Impala, four-door sedan had its roof completely removed and replaced with the iconic double-bubble top. The rear doors were sealed up, the remaining small front doors making it rather difficult to get in and out. Body modifications were quickly carried out by riveting aluminum additions over the original bodywork. Black and orange paint, plus decals, completed a passable replica that was fully street-legal on UK roads. Once its use for promotional purposes was complete, the car was delivered to a scrapyard for cutting up.

===&quot;Batman&quot; (1989 film) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;===

Tim Burton&#x27;s live-action films &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992) presented a different version of the Batmobile, which reflected those films&#x27; Art Deco version of Gotham City. The car was designed by conceptual illustrator Julian Caldow and built by John Evans special effects team at Pinewood Studios in England. The body of the car was sculpted out of foam by Keith Short in collaboration with Eddie Butler and the fiberglass work being done by John Lovell. It was long, low, and sleek, and was built on a Chevrolet Impala chassis. Two cars in total were built for the movie. The back of the Batmobile resembles the back of the Fiat Turbina, which was a gas-turbine concept from the 1950s. For &quot;Batman Returns&quot; in 1992, Carl Casper and Tom Oberhaus of Hollywood Productions were contracted to build 3 Batmobiles for principal photography. Carl Casper retained the number 1 hero car until recently (2021). That car is now in a private collection in California. The number 2 car was last known to be in a private collection in Japan since 1992. The number 3 car is owned by comedian Jeff Dunham.

====Features====
Spherical bombs could be deployed from its sides. An afterburner was housed in the back. Two M1919 Browning machine guns were hidden behind flaps in each fender. Its grappling hook, once hooked on a structure, serves as an anchor to allow the batmobile to make an extremely sharp turn at high speed that its pursuers typically cannot duplicate. It had super hydraulic for course changes, and a Batdisc ejector (side-mounted) that could fire precisely 15 Batdiscs in the 1-second pulse. Other gadgets included chassis-mounted shinbreakers, oil slick dispensers and smoke emitters. Inside, the two-seat cockpit featured aircraft-like instrumentation, a passenger&#x27;s side monitor, self-diagnostics system, CD recorder, and voice-command recognition system. In &quot;Batman Returns&quot; it is shown to have a secondary mode referred to as the &quot;Batmissile&quot;, where the wheels would retract inward and the sides of the vehicle would break off, converting the car into a thin bullet train-like form capable of squeezing through tight alleyways. Obviously, this secondary mode would require the car to be reassembled and significantly repaired.

The Batmobile&#x27;s shields are made of ceramic fractal armor panels. They explode outward when struck by projectiles, deflecting injurious force away from the car and its occupants. If Batman must leave the Batmobile for an extended period of time, he can, through a voice command spoken into a wrist device (specifically, the word &quot;shields&quot;), activate the Batmobile&#x27;s shielding system. This prevents anyone from tampering with the vehicle while it is left unattended. Bulletproof and fireproof steel armor plates envelop the body and cockpit entirely. While this armor is in place, the vehicle cannot be driven. In &quot;Batman&quot; the shields were not fully functioning. In reality, a life-size model was built, and the shield activation sequence was created with stop motion animation technology. In &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, the shields held the same characteristics. However, the design was slimmer and the special effects were provided by computer-generated imagery. In shield mode, a small but powerful bomb can be deployed.

====Other appearances====
* A series of Onstar TV advertisements featured this particular Batmobile being equipped with the system. OnStar allowed Batman to call various Gotham characters, summon police, remotely unlock the vehicle&#x27;s doors and find the nearest jet fuel station.
* This version of the Batmobile was later seen in the &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; episode called &quot;Don&#x27;t Tug on Superman&#x27;s Cape&quot;, an episode which shows that some collectors had apparently stolen the Batmobile.
* In the movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, Daffy Duck drives the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile into the water tower on the Warner Bros. studio lot, causing it to fall over and nearly crush Jenna Elfman&#x27;s character.
* On the TV series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile approaches the WB studios front gates, the guard at the door greets the driver by saying &quot;Good afternoon Mr. Keaton&quot;. Another &quot;Animaniacs&quot; cartoon features a parody of the poem &#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas. As the WB studios empty out for the Christmas break, the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile pulls up to the gate, and Ralph the Guard waves it through, saying, &quot;Goodnight, Mr. Keaton, that&#x27;s a lovely sedan&quot;. In a third &quot;Animaniacs&quot; appearance, Dot Warner&#x27;s interpretation of a Puck soliloquy from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; renders the line, &quot;And Robin shall make amends ere long&quot; as &quot;And the Boy Wonder will save us&quot;. The Tim Burton version of the Batmobile then drives up to the Warner siblings and opens its canopy; Robin pulls the trio into the car, which departs, saving them from an angry fairy.
* In the &quot;RPM&quot; episode of the animated series &quot;The Batman&quot;, one of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s Batmobile prototypes is the Batmobile from the Tim Burton films.
* In the animated film &quot;&quot; segment &quot;Working Through Pain&quot;, Alfred uses the 1989 Batmobile to pull the sewer gate to rescue Batman trapped underneath.
* In the Arrowverse crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile makes a brief appearance in the Earth-99 Batcave.
* The 1992 Tim Burton &quot;hero car&quot; is now owned and held in a private collection in Southern California. This is the &quot;Movie Car-1. Previously this car was in the builders&#x27; private collection.
* The vehicle had a cameo appearance in the 2023 movie &quot;The Flash&quot;.

====Replicas====
* The only actual turbine-powered Batmobile in existence is a replica of the 1989 film car. It is powered by a military Boeing turboshaft engine driving the rear wheels through a 4 speed semi-automatic transmission and is street registered. This car was designed and constructed by Casey Putsch of Putsch Racing in 2011.
* In Pune, India, a replica of the car was spotted in June 2015.
* Replicas of the Tim Burton-era Batmobiles are on display in front of several roller coasters and also in the street near Batman Adventure – The Ride 2 at Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia.
* Historic auto attractions in Roscoe, Illinois displays a replica Batmobile from &quot;Batman Returns&quot; as well as the &quot;Batmissile&quot; in addition to a replica of the Batmobile from the 1960s television series.
* A replica was spotted at the Al Barsha area of Dubai, the United Arab Emirates in October 2020. It had a very strange kind of controls and dashboard.

===&quot;Batman Forever&quot;===
As the Batman films were handed over to director Joel Schumacher from Tim Burton, the design for the Batmobile was updated. Tim Flattery drew the winning design. Decorative lighting was added to the vehicle&#x27;s rims, sides, and front edge, and the wing-shaped fins reached further into the air. The car had a few unique features, such as being able to rotate its wheels through 90 degrees so that it could move in a perpendicular direction, a grappling hook allowing the Batmobile to drive up walls, and the speed to perform large jumps from surface to surface during chases across Gotham City&#x27;s elevated freeways and gigantic statues.

The &quot;Batman Forever&quot; Batmobile&#x27;s ability to drive up walls was displayed as Batman eludes a dead-end provided by Two-Face and his henchmen. Later in the film, Dick Grayson takes the Batmobile for a joy ride without Batman&#x27;s permission or awareness. Ultimately, it was destroyed when the Riddler deposited a sack full of explosives in the cockpit.

The design of the Batmobiles of the Schumacher films have garnered criticism for allegedly resembling giant phalli.

====Technical specifications====
The &quot;Batman Forever&quot; Batmobile had a Chevrolet 350 ZZ3 high-performance motor. The body is made from a high-temperature epoxy-fiberglass laminate. The wheelbase is 118 in. (), the average car wheelbase measures around 103 (USDOT Data 1980–2000) inches. In all, its size was 300 in long and 126 in high. Carbon fiber was used to build the body of this particular Batmobile. The specifications for the Batmobile in this film are:

* Length: 300 in (7.62 m)
* Width: 94.4 in
* Height: 126 in (3.20 m)
* Maximum speed: 330 mph with booster
* Engine: 350 hp (est.), 350 cu in ZZ3 Chevrolet V8 engine, automatic transmission, custom front and rear suspension.
* Wheelbase: 118 in
* Tires: pivotable
====Features====
The Batmobile depicted in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) sought to accentuate its intricate lines. To do this, the filmmakers equipped it with engine panels, wheels, and undercarriage that were indirectly lit so that they appeared to glow blue. The &quot;Batman Forever&quot; car also had a split cockpit canopy, separate fenders, and jet exhaust. The roof fin could be opened into a &quot;V&quot; shape for a more contemporary look, though the only time this was shown is during the scene when Dick Grayson is taking the car out for a joyride through the city. The wheels were made to keep the bat emblems upright when the wheels are turning. The bat-emblem on the hubcaps was a counter-rotating gear that transferred into a stationary point. The two-seat cockpit featured a rear-view monitor, system diagnostics display, and custom gauge cluster. H. R. Giger was chosen to design the Batmobile in the very early stages of production. Schumacher&#x27;s crew was unable to understand how they could construct a functional version. Only two sketches and an early blueprint were completed.

There were two primary avoidance/defense features on the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; version. First, it had the ability to lock all four wheels perpendicular to its centerline, to allow for quick sideways movement. Second, for more dire circumstances, the Batmobile could reroute the jet exhaust to under its front end and launch grappling cables at overhead anchors. With the nose up and the lines in place, the car could climb sheer vertical surfaces like building walls as if it were driving on flat ground.

====Other appearances====
* In episode 53 of the TV series &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, Drew Carey won the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; version of the Batmobile as a prize. Lewis and Oswald take it on a joyride dressed as Batman and Robin without Drew&#x27;s permission. Oswald was played by Diedrich Bader (Batman&#x27;s voice in &quot;&quot;).
* In &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot;, three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet an effeminate youth named Joel in front of a shoemaker&#x27;s shop, whose idea of Batman consists mainly of a fascination with the tight rubber suits and a Batmobile that can drive up walls (as seen in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;). The other three children treat Joel&#x27;s ideas with utter disdain.

===&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997 film)===
A new Batmobile is seen in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. The last Batmobile to appear in the motion picture series, was designed by Harald Belker. It is prominently featured in one scene in which, as Batman and Robin are in pursuit, Mr. Freeze shoots the underside of the car for several seconds with a freeze-gun, before the car crash-lands. However, in the next scene in the Batcave, the Batmobile is sitting back on its pedestal appearing to be in perfect condition.

====Technical specifications====
In &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, the aerodynamic chassis design and &quot;T&quot; axis wheelbase provided the Batmobile counterbalance gyrometric stability, allowing for high velocity 90-degree turns at speeds greater than 70 mph without losing momentum. Initial plans had the Batmobile being able to transform into the &quot;Bathammer&quot; vehicle seen in this film,[A] but were abandoned. The specifications for the Batmobile in this film are as follows:

* Length: 396 in () long. The six flame columns formed a V-shaped output of 71 in (1.80 m) length.
* Height: 59.05 in (1.5 m)
* Maximum Speed: 230 mph on open road, 350 mph with afterburner thrust; TFX road tested the Batmobile at 140 mph. 350 km/h and the additional jet propulsion brings the cars to 530 km/h.
* Engine: Chevy 350 ZZ3 (off-road racing motor). Instead of a single jet exhaust, this Batmobile had a &quot;boattail&quot; rear flanked by separate fenders, each with three smaller exhaust nozzles.
* Axle Base: 388 in
* Tires: It rode on custom 22&quot; wheels with prototype, 55 in GoodYear tires with Batsymbols in the treads.
====Features====
The second Schumacher era Batmobile featured neither a passenger seat nor a canopy. Like the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; car, this Batmobile (which was designed by Harald Belker) featured light-up wheels and engine panels. The displays were much more involved with this car, however, with red, orange, yellow, and blue lights, as well as special pulsating lights in the counter-rotating turbine intake.

The nozzles were canted away from the centerline of the car slightly, so the final effect was that the six exhausts made a &quot;V&quot; pattern to keep the car pointed straight ahead. A bat mask was incorporated onto the nose of the car, although the sculpted lines made it somewhat difficult to make out at first. The fins were unmistakable and remain as the largest set ever built into a real-world Batmobile. On the &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; version the arsenal of weaponry and gadgets is controlled by an onboard voice-activated computer that surrounds the single-seat cockpit. From behind the wheel, the driver has access to a multifunctioning key command response system that delivers immediate weapon activation during an attack and defensive procedures. The &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; version of the Batmobile was equipped with dual-mount, sub carriage rocket launchers, front and rear grappling hooks, multipoint infrared and laser scan tracking units, anterior/posterior wheel-based axle bombs, catapult ejection seat, and disguised central carriage, which detaches to become an emergency road vehicle. The single-seat cockpit featured a two-way video conferencing screen, radar unit, and Redbird communication switch.

===The &quot;Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy===


The Batmobile depicted in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s trilogy of Batman films owes much to the tank-like vehicle from Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot;; it has a more &quot;workhorse&quot; appearance than the sleek automobiles seen in previous incarnations, designed for functionality and intimidation. While the films never refer to the vehicle as the &quot;Batmobile&quot;, it is still referred to as such in the scripts. The film&#x27;s production designer described the machine as a cross between a Lamborghini and a tank.

In &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), Bruce Wayne utilizes the prototype vehicle known as the Tumbler designed by Wayne Enterprises&#x27; Applied Sciences Division as a bridging vehicle for the military. It includes weaponry and the ability to boost into a rampless jump. The Tumbler&#x27;s armor is strong enough to break through concrete barriers without sustaining significant damage. Two full-sized driving versions were used in exterior shots while another full-sized model with hydraulic enhancements was used in jump sequences. A further full-sized, functional version carried propane tanks to fuel the rocket blast out of the rear nozzle. A radio controlled, 1/3-scale electric model also performed stunts in the film including the rooftop chase sequence. Six vehicles were built for the production of the film.

In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), the Tumbler returns and appears twice in the movie: where Batman captures the Scarecrow, and in a chase where it is damaged by an RPG fired by the Joker in an attempt to kill Harvey Dent. This causes the Tumbler to crash and Batman to eject from it in the Batpod (a motorcycle formed by the front wheels and struts of the Tumbler) as part of a self-destruct sequence that sees the remainder of the vehicle explode. The Tumbler is also seen in the trailers in a deleted scene, exiting the improvised Batcave.

In &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), several Tumblers are seen. Each of these vehicles has the Tumbler&#x27;s original military camouflage and is stolen from Wayne Enterprises by Bane&#x27;s gang. The stolen Tumblers are used in Bane&#x27;s attempt to control Gotham and are notably seen when the mass of police and criminals are about to battle. One of the Tumblers fires at the crowd of police, only for the Bat to intercept the shot. Three of the Tumblers are destroyed by Batman using the Bat and Selina Kyle using the Batpod.

====Features====
The Christopher Nolan version of the Batmobile has a pair of autocannons mounted in the nose of the car between the front wheels. In &quot;Attack&quot; mode, the driver&#x27;s seat moves to the center of the car, and the driver is repositioned to lie face-down with his head in the center section between the front wheels. This serves two main purposes: first, it provides more substantial protection with the driver shielded by multiple layers of armor plating. Second, the low-down, centralized driving position makes extreme precision maneuvers easier to perform, while lying prone reduces the risk of injury a driver faces when making these maneuvers. Other devices included:
* Rear flaps to assist brakes
* Dual front autocannons
* Rocket launcher
* Landing hook to sprung landing stabilization
* Integrated fire-extinguishing system
* Integrated safety connection to gasoline control
* Jet engine (with afterburners) on back of vehicle for quick boosts/&quot;rampless&quot; jumps
* &quot; Stealth mode&quot; avoids detection using a variety of stealth technologies that reduce reflection/emission of radar, infrared, visible light, radio-frequency (RF) spectrum, and audio; the car&#x27;s lights and main engine are deactivated; the vehicle is powered by an auxiliary electric motor. This makes the car very hard to find at night or in dark places, and as demonstrated by the car chase in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, can easily throw off pursuers.
* Explosive caltrops are deployed from the rear of the vehicle, which can impair any vehicles that make contact with them.
* The front of the car is heavily armored, so the car can ram as a practical offensive attack, and also protects the driver while in the prone driving position/&quot;Attack&quot; mode
* Both front wheels can eject when the vehicle is damaged to form the Batpod, a motorcycle-like vehicle (the rest self-destructs).
* The new Tumblers are modified with experimental weapons:
** A set of missile launchers
** A retractable artillery cannon on a turret
====Production process====
The new incarnation of the Tumbler was proposed by Nolan after he built a proof-of-concept model design out of Play-Doh – a model he admitted looked &quot;very very crude, more like a croissant than a car&quot;. Nathan Crowley, one of the production designers for &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, then started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing based on that shape. One of the parts that Crowley used to create the vehicle was the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the car&#x27;s jet engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Andy Smith, carved a full-size replica of the vehicle out of a large block of Styrofoam, which was a process that lasted two months.

The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel &quot;test frame&quot;, which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over 100 mph, go from 0 to in 5 seconds, possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners, and to withstand a self-propelled launch of up to . On the first jump test, the Tumbler&#x27;s front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed vehicle included a 5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear axle, front racing tires by Hoosier, rear 4×4 mud tires by Interco., and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.

With the design process completed, four street-ready cars were constructed. Each vehicle possessed 65 carbon fiber panels and cost $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. Due to the poor visibility inside the vehicle by the driver, monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film&#x27;s scenes.

The interior was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable version. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the car was a miniature model that was 1:3 scale of the full-sized one. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show it flying across ravines and between buildings. However, a full-size car was used for the waterfall sequence. The scale model scenes were filmed on a massive set built on a stage at Shepperton Studios in England over the course of nine weeks. The full-sized vehicles were driven and filmed on the streets of Chicago. In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, the Batpod ejects from the Tumbler, with the Tumbler&#x27;s front wheels as the Batpod&#x27;s wheels; this was rendered using computer-generated imagery when attempts to achieve the separation through practical effects proved impossible.

===DC Extended Universe===

According to the Warner Bros. Studios lot, the &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; Batmobile combined inspiration from both the sleek, streamlined design of classic Batmobiles and the high-suspension, military build from the more recent Tumbler from &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;. They were also inspired by the 1989 Batmobile. Designed by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos and Dennis McCarthy, the Batmobile is about 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. Unlike previous Batmobiles, it has a Gatling gun sitting on the front and the back tires are shaved down tractor tires. The Batmobile elevates itself for scenes depicting it going into battle or when performing jumps and lowers to the ground when cruising through the streets. The Batmobile appears in a flashback for &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, when Batman was pursuing the Joker and Harley Quinn before their car crashed into the river, the Joker escaping while Harley was captured.

In the 2017 film &quot;Justice League&quot; and its 2021 director&#x27;s cut, Batman owns a new four-legged tank-vehicle called the &quot;Knightcrawler&quot;, which was designed by his father during World War II. The Crawler is used in the fight against Steppenwolf to rescue Star Labs scientists (including Cyborg&#x27;s father Dr. Silas Stone) underneath an abandoned Gotham Harbor. Near the end, the new team board the portable troop carrier aka &quot;Flying Fox&quot; carrying the new armored Batmobile to battle Steppenwolf in Pozharnov, Russia.

The 2019 DCEU film &quot;Shazam!&quot; features an animated end credits sequence in which Bruce Wayne was shown changing into his Batman costume in Wayne Manor, before breaking through a window and chasing after the Batmobile, which was stolen by Shazam.

====Features====
The Batmobile is an armored tactical assault vehicle that has the ability to raise or lower its suspension, depending on its combat or navigational situations. It also has a miniature jet engine afterburner to provide a quick thrust in pursuits and jumps. The exterior body is completely bulletproof and can easily withstand sustained gunfire from miniguns. The Batmobile has measured at long and wide at the rear. The vehicle is estimated to reach up to .

It weighs in at , overpowered with an unmatched hybrid of prototype military and civilian performance technologies. The Batmobile&#x27;s imposing defense capabilities, supported by Wayne Enterprises technologies, have been integrated with the latest in covert military grade armaments, stealth, and active protection systems.

The interior and controls are modeled after the aircraft fighter cockpit, promoting utilitarian function over aesthetic design, with a number of buttons and switches available to toggle the many functions of the vehicle. The passenger side is retrofitted to function as a miniature armory, storing backup grapple guns, Batarangs, smoke grenades, and a grenade launcher.

The Batmobile is equipped with a gimbal-mounted machine gun on its front section and a harpoon launcher in the rear, capable of dragging a truck behind it with ease. It is also equipped with missile racks and flare countermeasures to counter incoming homing missiles. The Batmobile is also capable of autonomous control, should Batman ever need to leave the Batmobile. An electric current runs along with the vehicle&#x27;s exterior plating, able to shock and incapacitate those unlucky enough to get too close.

===&quot;The Batman&quot; (2022)===

&quot;The Batman&quot;″s director Matt Reeves tweeted photos of the Batmobile for the film as a muscle car. With the bodywork of the car appearing to be a 1968 or 1970s Dodge Charger, the car is meant to be a pursuit and capture vehicle built entirely by Bruce in the Batcave under Wayne Tower.

At the start of the film, the car appears in the Batcave covered, while Bruce is working on assembling the car. In an interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Reeves also drew inspiration from the 1983 John Carpenter film &quot;Christine&quot; to give the Batmobile a horror-like presence.

The Batmobile has recesses on its hood which earlier were thought to be for machine guns, but are actually vents for the flame exhausts. These coupled with the exhaust pipes on the sides, and the hood which lights up as Batman is revving the car, give an intimidating appearance to onlookers and enemies alike. The car also has a jet afterburner built into the back, which apart from giving Batman a boost, also emits an unearthly shriek during its startup which Batman uses to intimidate his foes, as he does to the Penguin. The only flaw to this setup is that the back of the car housing the jet afterburner engine is exposed due to Bruce using the half-finished car later in the movie. However the rest of the car, including the windows is heavily armored to the extent that bullets bounce off it, as shown when Penguin empties a magazine into the car but does not do any damage. The Batmobile also has four massive racing tires allowing for all terrain weather and driving conditions. The car is also shown to be durable enough to smash through wooden pallets and concrete cylinders without any damage, as well as being able to violently flip cars with its ram-like bumper, as done to the Penguin. Additionally, unlike the previous iterations of the Batmobile, and also owing to the half-finished nature of the car, this is the only Batmobile since the 1940s to not feature any gadgets beyond the armor, except for a customized car phone to make calls.

Four units were built for the film. The primary driving unit is powered by a V8 engine that generates 650 horsepower. Another unit was built on a Tesla chassis for indoor or night shots.

===&quot;Gotham&quot;===

At the beginning of the Season Four episode &quot;A Dark Knight: That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;, Alfred takes Bruce to the garage at Wayne Manor on his seventeenth birthday to present him with his gift: a heavily fortified matte-black Ford Mustang that functions as a proto-Batmobile, the choice of make being a reference to the original Batmobile which was a modified Lincoln Futura and manufactured by Ford.

===&quot;Titans&quot;===

In the episode &quot;Jason Todd&quot; during a flashback to Dick Grayson&#x27;s time as part of the dynamic duo, the Batmobile is shown very briefly, parked inside the Batcave. This version of the car was initially designed by concept artist John Gallagher, who provided the visual effects company Encore VFX with over 30 designs before it was whittled down to one final piece with the efforts of other artists and contributors. This Batmobile was later seen in greater detail during the season finale when the Gotham City Police Department launched an assault on the Batcave.

===&quot;Batwoman&quot;===

In the second season of &quot;Batwoman&quot;, Ryan Wilder, the new Batwoman, drives the Batmobile as her vehicle of choice.

===Copyright status===
The Batmobile is copyrighted under United States law by DC Comics, a status often thought to usually be reserved to sentient fictional characters. This was established in court when a mechanic making Batmobile replicas roughly based on the 1960s Adam West version of the Batmobile was sued by DC Comics in 2011 in the case &quot;DC Comics v Mark Towle&quot;. The mechanic had argued that the Batmobile was a &quot;functional&quot; element of the show and thus ineligible for copyright; however, the court ruled that the Batmobile was an &quot;automotive character&quot; with its own style, backstory, and theme that remained consistent across versions: a &quot;bat-like appearance&quot; and &quot;always contains the most up-to-date weaponry and technology&quot;. In addition, builder George Barris applied for and received a US Design Patent for the car in 1966. Although the patent expired in 1980, during its lifetime it served as the basis for Barris&#x27; successfully claiming ownership of the Jim Sermersheim &quot;No. 5&quot; Batmobile replica.

==Notes==
^ In &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Batman uses the &quot;Bathammer&quot; to battle Mr. Freeze and his henchmen through the frozen streets of Gotham City. The Bathammer is, in essence, a Batmobile for travelling on icy surfaces. It is long and high. The top speed is 100 mph on ice. The Bathammer can move over enormous skids underneath. It also carries vertical stabilizers (3 m long) that can be directed upward in an emergency and used as shield.

<text>Atlanta was a casemate ironclad that served in the Confederate and Union Navies during the American Civil War. She was converted from a British-built blockade runner named &quot;Fingal&quot; by the Confederacy after she made one run to Savannah, Georgia. After several failed attempts to attack Union blockaders, the ship was captured by two Union monitors in 1863 when she ran aground. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was floated off, repaired, and rearmed, serving in the Union Navy for the rest of the war. She spent most of her time deployed on the James River supporting Union forces there. The ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in reserve. Several years after the end of the war, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was sold to Haiti, but was lost at sea in December 1869 on her delivery voyage.

==Description and career as &quot;Fingal&quot;==
&quot;Fingal&quot; was designed and built as a merchantman by J&amp;G Thomson&#x27;s Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard at Govan in Glasgow, Scotland, and was completed early in 1861. She was described by Midshipman Dabney Scales, who served on the &quot;Atlanta&quot; before her battle with the monitors, as being a two-masted, iron-hulled ship long with a beam of . She had a draft of and a depth of hold of . He estimated her tonnage at around 700 tons bm. &quot;Fingal&quot; was equipped with two vertical single-cylinder direct-acting steam engines using steam generated by one flue-tubular boiler. The engines drove the ship at a top speed of around . They had a bore of and a stroke of .

The ship briefly operated between Glasgow and other ports in Scotland for Hutcheson&#x27;s West Highland Service before she was purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, and Major Edward Clifford Anderson Confederate Secretary of War in England, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that they purchased. To disguise his control of &quot;Fingal&quot;, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bulloch and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, &quot;Fingal&quot; rammed and sank the Austrian brig &quot;Siccardi&quot;, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched a letter to his financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig&#x27;s owners because he could not afford to take the time to deal with the affair lest he and &quot;Fingal&quot; be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer&#x27;s real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. &quot;Fingal&quot; was able to slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.

While &quot;Fingal&quot; was discharging her cargo, Bulloch and Anderson went to Richmond to confer with Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Navy. Mallory endorsed Bulloch&#x27;s plan to load &quot;Fingal&quot; with cotton to sell on the Navy Department&#x27;s account to be used to purchase more ships and equipment in Europe. He returned to Savannah on 23 November and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal. He made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 December, but it proved impossible to do as the Union controlled every channel from Savannah, aided by their occupation of Tybee Island at the mouth of the Savannah River. Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to Europe some other way.

==As &quot;Atlanta&quot;==

The brothers Asa and Nelson Tift received the contract to convert the blockade runner into an ironclad in early 1862 with the name of &quot;Atlanta&quot;, after the city in Georgia. This was largely financed by contributions from the women of Savannah. &quot;Fingal&quot; was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were built out from the sides of her hull to support her casemate. After the conversion, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was long overall and had a beam of . Her depth of hold was now and she now had a draft of . &quot;Atlanta&quot; now displaced and her speed was estimated at .

The armor of the casemate was angled at 30° from the horizontal and made from two layers of railroad rails, rolled into plates thick and wide. The outer layer ran vertically and the inner layer horizontally. Her armor was backed by of oak, vertically oriented, and two layers of of pine, alternating in direction. The bottom of the casemate was some from the waterline and its top was above the waterline. The pyramidal pilothouse was armored in the same way and had room for two men. The upper portion of &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s hull received of armor.
The rectangular casemate was pierced with eight narrow gun ports, one each at the bow and stern and three along each side. Each gun port was protected by an armored shutter made of two layers of iron riveted together and allowed the guns to elevate only to a maximum of +5 to +7°. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was armed with single-banded, Brooke rifles on pivot mounts at the bow and stern. The middle gun port on each side was occupied by a single-banded, Brooke rifle. The 17-caliber, seven-inch guns weighed about and fired armor-piercing &quot;bolts&quot; and explosive shells. The equivalent statistics for the 18.5-caliber, 6.4-inch gun were with 80-pound bolts and shells. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was also armed with a , solid iron, ram that was reinforced by a series of vertical steel bars. In front of the ram was a spar torpedo that carried of black powder on a wooden pole connected to an iron lever that could be raised or lowered by means of pulleys.
On 31 July 1862, under the command of Lieutenant Charles H. McBlair, &quot;Atlanta&quot; conducted her sea trials down the Savannah River toward Fort Pulaski. The ship proved to be difficult to steer, and the additional weight of her armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft. This latter was a real problem in the shallow waters near Savannah. She also leaked significantly, and her design virtually eliminated air circulation. One report said that &quot;it was almost intolerable on board the &quot;Atlanta&quot;, there being no method of ventilation, and the heat was intense.&quot; Scales commented in his diary, &quot;What a comfortless, infernal and God-forsaken ship!!&quot; 
Attempts were made to fix the problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks.
The ship was commissioned on 22 November and became the flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall III, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived before the end of January. Nonetheless, Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After &quot;Atlanta&quot; successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall&#x27;s plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall&#x27;s perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; &quot;Atlanta&quot; remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.

Webb demonstrated his aggressiveness when he attempted to sortie on the first spring tide (30 May) after taking command, but &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions, and the ship ran aground. She was not damaged although it took over a day to pull her free. He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide, rejecting Mallory&#x27;s idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad &quot;Savannah&quot; was finished before his next sortie. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, had ordered the monitors &quot;Weehawken&quot; and &quot;Nahant&quot; into Wassaw Sound. Commander John Rodgers in &quot;Weehawken&quot; had overall command of the two ships.

In the early evening of 15 June, Webb began his next attempt by passing over the lower obstructions in the Wilmington River and spent the rest of the night coaling. He moved forward the next evening to a concealed position within easy reach of the monitors for an attack early the following morning. Webb planned to sink one of the monitors with his spar torpedo and then deal with the other one with his guns. The gunboat &quot;Isondiga&quot; and the tugboat &quot;Resolute&quot; were to accompany him to tow one or both of the monitors back to Savannah.

A lookout aboard &quot;Weehawken&quot; spotted &quot;Atlanta&quot; at 04:10 on the morning of 17 June. When the latter ship closed to within about of the two Union ships, she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over &quot;Weehawken&quot; and landed near &quot;Nahant&quot;. Shortly afterward, &quot;Atlanta&quot; ran aground on a sandbar; she was briefly able to free herself, but the pressure of the tide pushed her back onto the sandbar. This time Webb was unable to get off and the monitors closed the range. When &quot;Weehawken&quot;, the leading ship, closed to within she opened fire with both of her guns. The shell missed, but the shell struck the ironclad above the port middle gun port, penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it, spraying splinters and fragments that disabled the entire gun crew and half the crew of the bow gun, even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through the backing. The next shot from the 11-inch Dahlgren gun struck the upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate the two-inch armor there. The next shell from the 15-inch Dahlgren glanced off the middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened, wounding half the gun&#x27;s crew with fragments. The final shell was also from the 15-inch Dahlgren and it struck the top of the pilothouse, breaking the armor there and wounding both pilots in it. By this time, &quot;Atlanta&quot; had been able to fire only seven shots, none of which hit either Union ship, and was hard aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half. &quot;Weehawken&quot; and &quot;Nahant&quot; were able to freely maneuver into positions from which the &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance futile. Webb surrendered his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire, before &quot;Nahant&quot; even had a chance to fire. Of the ironclad&#x27;s 21 officers and 124 enlisted men, one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization.

==In the Union Navy==

&quot;Atlanta&quot; was easily pulled free by the Union ships and she reached Port Royal under her own power. Not badly damaged, she was repaired and bought by the Union Navy. The prize money of $350,000 was shared between the crews of &quot;Weehawken&quot;, &quot;Nahant&quot; and the gunboat , the only ships within signaling distance. The ship retained her name and was commissioned again on 2 February 1864, rearmed with a pair of , 150-pound Parrott rifles in the bow and stern and 6.4-inch, 100-pound Parrott rifles amidships. The 150-pound Parrott rifle weighed and was 17 calibers long. The 100-pounder weighed and was 20 calibers long. It fired a shell a distance of at an elevation of +25°. All four of her Brooke rifles are currently located in Willard Park in the Washington Navy Yard. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and spent most of her time stationed up the James River where she could support operations against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the ironclads of the James River Squadron. On 21 May 1864, she and the gunboat fired on and dispersed Confederate cavalry that was attacking Fort Powhatan and she was deployed further upriver in February 1865 after the Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach to better blockade the Confederate ironclads at Richmond.

After the end of the war in April, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was decommissioned in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 and placed in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer who had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled in a civil war. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either &quot;Triumph&quot; or &quot;Triumfo&quot;, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.

<doc id="914155" wikidata="Q1765486" url="?curid=914155" title="Yang Chengfu">
<text>Yang Chengfu (1883–1936) was one of the best known teachers of Yang-style tai chi Chinese martial art. He helped develop the art into its modern form. His students would go on to found successful martial arts schools of their own and helped spread Yang-style tai chi around the world. 

==Biography==
Yang Chengfu was born into the famous Yang family of tai chi practitioners, the son of Yang Jianhou and grandson of Yang Luchan. With his older brother Yang Shaohou and colleagues Wu Jianquan and Sun Lutang, he was among the first teachers to offer tai chi instruction to the general public at the Beijing Physical Culture Research Institute from 1914 until 1928. He moved to Shanghai in 1928.

Chengfu is known for having &quot;smoothed&quot; out the somewhat more vigorous training routine he learned from his family as well as emphasising a &quot;large frame&quot; () with expansive movements in stepping and using large circular motions with the arms. His smooth, evenly paced large-frame form, along with its hundreds of offshoots, has been the standard for Yang-style tai chi (and overwhelmingly in the public imagination for tai chi in general) ever since.

Chengfu is the official author of two books on the style, &quot;Application Methods of Tai Chi&quot;, published in 1931, and &quot;Essence and Applications of Tai Chi&quot;, published in 1934. His second book was translated into English in 2005.

==Students and Descendants==
His direct descendants, the many students he taught, and their students, have spread the art around the world. Among Yang Chengfu&#x27;s students were famous masters such as Zhao Bin (his older brothers grandson 1906-1906) Dong Yingjie, Chen Weiming, Fu Zhongwen, Li Yaxuan (李雅轩; 1894–1976) and Cheng Man-chʻing. Each of them taught extensively, founding groups that still teach tai chi to this day. Cheng Man-chʻing, perhaps the most famous outside of China, significantly shortened and simplified the traditional forms Yang taught him after his teacher&#x27;s passing, reportedly to make them more accessible to larger numbers of students. Although Cheng&#x27;s modifications are considered controversial by most other schools and are not recognized by the Yang family, Cheng Man-chʻing is known as one of the first to teach tai chi in the West.

His sons have continued to teach their father&#x27;s tai chi, including his first son, the late Yang Shouzhong (1910-1985), who brought Yang-style tai chi to Hong Kong, his second son Yang Zhenji (1921-2007), his third son, Yang Zhenduo (1926-2020), who lived in Shanxi Province, who was widely considered the most prominent of the Yang family tai chi instructors, and his fourth son, Yang Zhenguo, born in 1928, and living in Handan, Hebei.

<doc id="914159" wikidata="Q656586" url="?curid=914159" title="Alluvial plain">
<text>An alluvial plain is a plain (an essentially flat landform) created by the deposition of sediment over a long period by one or more rivers coming from highland regions, from which alluvial soil forms. A &quot;floodplain&quot; is part of the process, being the smaller area over which the rivers flood at a particular time. In contrast, the alluvial plain is the larger area representing the region over which the floodplains have shifted over geological time.

As the highlands erode due to weathering and water flow, the sediment from the hills is transported to the lower plain. Various creeks will carry the water further to a river, lake, bay, or ocean. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the floodplain of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will, over time, seek new, lower paths, forming a meander (a curved path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees at the margins of the flood channel, will be eroded by lateral stream erosion, local rainfall, and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses. These processes, over geologic time, will form the plain, a region with little relief (local changes in elevation) yet with a constant but slight slope.

The &quot;Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms&quot;, maintained by the United States National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), defines an &quot;alluvial plain&quot; as &quot;a large assemblage of fluvial landforms (braided streams, terraces, etc.) that form a low gradient, regional ramps along the flanks of mountains and extend great distances from their sources (e.g., High Plains of North America)&quot;. Use of &quot;alluvial plain&quot; as a general, informal term for a broad flood plain or a low-gradient delta is explicitly discouraged. The NCSS glossary instead suggests &quot;flood plain&quot;.

Alluvial plains have similar traits to a river delta; however, the river delta will flow into a larger body of water. Alluvial plains generally lack this.

<doc id="914160" wikidata="Q258997" url="?curid=914160" title="Belarus at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>[[Belarus]] competed at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Soviet era. The Belarus Olympic Committee sent a total of 151 athletes to the Games, 82 men and 69 women, to compete in 22 sports.

The Belarusian team featured two defending Olympic champions: discus thrower Ellina Zvereva and single sculls rower Ekaterina Karsten. Along with Zvereva and Karsten, shooters Sergei Martynov, Kanstantsin Lukashyk, and Igor Basinski, and married couple Iryna Yatchenko and Igor Astapkovich competed at their fourth Olympic Games, although they first appeared as part of either the Soviet Union (Martynov and Basinski in 1988) or the Unified Team (Astapkovich, Yatchenko, Lukashyk, and Karsten in 1992). Notable Belarusian athletes featured professional tennis player Max Mirnyi, table tennis star Vladimir Samsonov, gymnast Ivan Ivankov, Russian-born judoka Anatoly Laryukov, and Greco-Roman wrestler Siarhei Lishtvan. Three-time Olympic champion and wrestling coach Alexander Medved became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Belarus left Athens with a total of 13 Olympic medals (2 gold, 5 silver, and 6 bronze), failing only one gold short of the total achieved in Sydney. Three of these medals were awarded to the athletes in weightlifting, and two each in rowing and boxing for the first time. Five Belarusian athletes set the nation&#x27;s historical record to win Olympic medals for the first time, including judoka Ihar Makarau in the men&#x27;s half-heavyweight division, track cyclist Natallia Tsylinskaya in the women&#x27;s time trial, and sprinter Yulia Nestsiarenka, who became the first non-American to claim the Olympic title in the women&#x27;s 100 metres since 1980.

Originally, Belarus had won a total of fifteen medals at these Games to match its record with Atlanta. On December 5, 2012, hammer thrower Ivan Tsikhan and discus thrower Iryna Yatchenko stripped off their silver and bronze medals respectively as being ordered by the International Olympic Committee, after drug re-testings of their samples were found positive.

<doc id="914161" wikidata="Q1433003" url="?curid=914161" title="Wayne Manor">
<text>Wayne Manor is a fictional mansion appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. It is the home of Bruce Wayne, owner of Wayne Enterprises, who is also the superhero Batman.

The house is depicted as a large mansion on the outskirts of Gotham City and is maintained by the Wayne family&#x27;s butler, Alfred Pennyworth. While the earliest stories showed Bruce Wayne buying the house himself, by the 1950s at the latest, retroactive continuity established that the manor had belonged to the Wayne family for several generations. Along with serving as a personal residence, the mansion sits above the Batcave, which Batman uses as his secret headquarters. The vast majority of DC Comics references place Wayne Manor just outside of Gotham City in the state of New Jersey.

The manor, indicative of Wayne&#x27;s ancestral wealth, is designed in a Gothic Revival architectural style, matching the Gothic architecture present in Gotham. For live-action films, English country house locations in Nottinghamshire, Hertfordshire, and Buckinghamshire, as well as Stevenson Taylor Hall in New York, have been used to depict Wayne Manor.

Wayne Manor appears in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series and in films &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy (2005–2012), in the DC Extended Universe (2016–2023) and &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022).

==Depiction==
===Mansion grounds===

Wayne Manor is depicted in earlier comics as being on the outskirts of Gotham City in the state of New Jersey. Comic book portrayals place the mansion within driving distance of Gotham City, close enough that the Bat-Signal can be seen from Wayne Manor alerting Batman of distress in the city.

Wayne Manor&#x27;s grounds include a surrounding gate around the perimeter with a larger front gate at the main entrance. Batman&#x27;s subterranean headquarters, the Batcave, is located beneath the mansion.

The grounds also includes a large hill that was partially hollowed out for Batman&#x27;s aerial vehicles, with the most prominent being the batcave, and there is also an underground river system that is large enough to accommodate docking space for the Batboat and has a large opening for said vehicle.

====&quot;Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne&quot;====
In &quot;&quot;, it is revealed that Wayne Manor was designed by Nathan Van Derm for Darius Wayne, forming a stylized &quot;W&quot;, although the additional gardens that existed at the time the manor was built add on to this symbol to create the image of a bat.

====Following the events of &quot;Cataclysm&quot;====
During the events of &quot;&quot; a massive earthquake struck Gotham City, the epicenter of which was less than a mile from Wayne Manor. The mansion was seriously damaged, as was the cave network beneath. The ground beneath the mansion shifted significantly, and actually revealed the Batcave below, although the Bat-family were able to relocate all of Batman&#x27;s equipment before official rescue came to the manor so that nobody would learn Bruce Wayne&#x27;s secrets. The original Manor was damaged beyond repair, forcing Bruce Wayne to redesign the Manor along with the Batcave. The new Manor is a veritable fortress, a pastiche of Gothic architecture combined with features of castellated architecture. Solar panels are installed in the new Manor, providing sustainable and environmentally-friendly electricity generation for the complex. It also includes a heliport for commercial helicopters.

====&quot;Batman Eternal&quot;/&quot;Arkham Manor&quot;====
During &quot;Batman Eternal&quot;, Hush&#x27;s machinations result in Wayne Enterprises being ruined and Bruce Wayne essentially bankrupt after the villain detonates various weapons caches Batman had concealed around Gotham. As part of this bankruptcy, Wayne Manor is repossessed by the city and turned into the new Arkham Asylum following the destruction of the original, but Bruce decides to accept this new status quo, reasoning that he can at least make sure that his enemies remain contained in the new manor given his intimate knowledge of its entrances and exits.

The manor is eventually reclaimed by Bruce&#x27;s lawyers, but it is temporarily left empty due to Bruce&#x27;s death and amnesic resurrection as Alfred wanted to give Bruce a chance to have a life without Batman. However, Bruce returns to the manor when he realizes who he used to be.

==== Gotham War ====
In &quot;Gotham War&quot;, Batman loses most of his money to the Joker. Afterward, Vandal Savage buys Wayne Manor and the Batcave.

=== Access to the Batcave ===
The manor grounds include the Batcave, an extensive cave system that Bruce Wayne discovered as a boy and uses as his base of operations. Its method of access has varied, though it is typically accessible from a hidden door behind a grandfather clock.

===The Wayne Foundation Penthouse===

While these grounds are the regular home of Bruce Wayne, he temporarily vacated it in the stories from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, preferring to live in a penthouse apartment on top of the Wayne Foundation building in the city, which also included a secret sub-basement acting as a Batcave.

Wayne came to this decision when Dick Grayson went off to college, which led him to decide that the mansion was now impractical with only one resident and one servant. Furthermore, Wayne decided he wanted to be closer to his main field of operations in Gotham City than a home situated outside the main urban area would allow. However, by the early 1980s, Wayne came to reconsider that purpose and decided that being less accessible to the public was more advantageous for his Batman activities and returned to Wayne Manor.

==Other versions==
===Vampire Batman===
In &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot;, Wayne Manor is destroyed as part of a plan to destroy Dracula&#x27;s vampire family, bombs exposing the interior of the Batcave to sunlight after Batman lured the vampires into the cave following a chase through Gotham&#x27;s sewers that ended in the Batcave just as the sun rose. Although the manor collapses into the cavern system after a second series of bombs are set off, thus concealing Bruce Wayne&#x27;s secret, Batman and Alfred relocate to a brownstone in the center of town, Batman residing in a mausoleum in the basement while Alfred prepares his equipment in the main house. Although Alfred and Gordon stake Batman at the conclusion of &quot;Batman: Bloodstorm&quot; after he succumbs to his vampire instincts and drinks the Joker&#x27;s blood, he is restored to life after Alfred removes the stake in &quot;Crimson Mist&quot;, subsequently relocating to the catacombs underneath the remains of Wayne Manor. The manor&#x27;s remains are finally destroyed for good when Gordon, Alfred, Two-Face, Killer Croc, and Two-Face&#x27;s gang plant bombs on the cave roof, exposing the interior to sunlight and ending Batman&#x27;s reign of terror once and for all.

===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
In &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, the Manor was mostly destroyed by Two-Face and Bane after Batman&#x27;s true identity was exposed; the Batcave, however, remained relatively untouched. By the end of the graphic novel, the Manor has been rebuilt as a hospital/hospice for Gulag battle victims.

===&quot;Milltown Road&quot;===
Outside of the bustling metropolis of New York City, and on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Brewster, NY, boasts an active ‘Wayne Manor’ on a private residence. Known for elaborately themed parties and functions, W.M. northeast includes custom stonework, multiple fireplaces, a standing tiki bar and the occasional overhead fireworks display. While private, all guests are welcome.

<doc id="914163" wikidata="Q918855" url="?curid=914163" title="Rafer Alston">
<text>Rafer Jamel Alston (born July 24, 1976), nicknamed &quot;Skip 2 My Lou&quot; after the American folk song and partner-stealing dance with the same name, is an American retired professional basketball player. Alston first gained basketball fame as a streetball player before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Milwaukee Bucks. While in the NBA from 1999 to 2010, he played for six teams, including the 2008–09 Orlando Magic team that made the NBA Finals.

== Streetball legend ==
Alston grew up in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York City, and was a standout streetball basketball player, known for his untraditional ballhandling moves that made him adept at outmaneuvering defenders. He was the inspiration in many ways for the AND1 Mixtape Tour—a low-quality, jerky 1999 videotape of Alston&#x27;s extreme playground moves, featuring helter-skelter crossover and other fast dribble moves faking out defenders, attracted a great deal of attention among players and basketball fans. His trademark skipping dribble when bringing the ball down the court earned him the nickname, Skip to My Lou.

He also played under well-known high school coach Ron Naclerio at Benjamin Cardozo High School in Queens, New York. Naclerio is credited with circulating the Alston tape and getting it in the hands of AND1 staff.

== College career ==
Alston played college basketball for three seasons: one each at Ventura College (1994–95), Fresno City College (1996–97), and then for Jerry Tarkanian at Fresno State (1997–98). Alston was red-shirted at Fresno City College for the 1995–96 season.

== Professional career ==

===Milwaukee Bucks (1999–2002)===
Alston struggled early in his NBA career, but successfully transitioned from streetball to the professional game. He played off the bench for most of the time he was with the Bucks. On November 17, 2001, when filling in for Sam Cassell, Alston led the Bucks to a 104–93 win over the Utah Jazz with 14 points and 10 assists.

=== Toronto Raptors (2003) ===
Alston signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2002, but was waived in October before the season began. On January 17, 2003, he signed with the Toronto Raptors. He played in 47 games, averaged about 21 minutes per game, and averaged 7.8 points per game.

=== Miami Heat (2003–2004) ===
Following his tenure with the Raptors, Alston emerged as a starter for the Miami Heat in 2004. He did not disappoint, averaging 12 points and 4 assists on a young Miami team, led by rookie guard Dwyane Wade, that made it to the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals of the 2004 NBA Playoffs. During that season, in a March 26 game against the Dallas Mavericks, he hit a game-winning shot in overtime with 0.5 seconds left over the outstretched arms of Shawn Bradley to catapult Miami to a 119–118 victory.

=== Return to Toronto (2004–2005) ===
Alston would sign a multi-year deal with the Toronto Raptors in the summer of 2004. In the 2004–2005 season, he played nearly all games that season (80), averaged about 34 minutes per game, and had his best point per game average (14.2) in his career.

===Houston Rockets (2005–2008)===
Alston was traded to the Houston Rockets for guard Mike James on October 4, 2005. Although Alston frequently was criticized for his attitude while in Toronto, it is believed that Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy conferred with his brother, Miami Heat coach Stan Van Gundy, who coached Alston during the 2003–04 NBA season, about Alston&#x27;s work ethic and attitude. Jeff Van Gundy&#x27;s reputation for toughness and his ability to get the most out of players previously considered &quot;trouble-makers&quot; or &quot;temperamental&quot; (e.g., Latrell Sprewell) led to optimism on the part of the Rockets&#x27; staff. In the 2006–07 season, as the Rockets starting point guard, Alston averaged 13.3 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.6 steals per game. He finished the season ninth in steals among all NBA players, fourth in three-pointers made, and 23rd in assists. 
On November 12, 2008, Alston was suspended for two games without pay for his role in a fight after a non-call foul with Matt Barnes and Steve Nash.

===Orlando Magic (2009)===
Alston was traded to the Orlando Magic in a three-way deal on February 19, 2009, and replaced the injured Jameer Nelson in the team&#x27;s starting lineup. On April 30, 2009, Alston helped the Orlando Magic defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 4–2 in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. Orlando then defeated the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers to advance to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games, after Alston was replaced in the starting lineup by returning star Jameer Nelson. The move was a somewhat controversial decision by Stan Van Gundy, because Alston had led the team to the playoffs. Alston averaged 10.6 points, 3.0 assists, and 2.2 rebounds in the Finals. In the 2009 playoffs, Alston started every game he played in.

===New Jersey Nets (2009–2010)===

On June 25, 2009, he was traded to the New Jersey Nets along with Tony Battie and Courtney Lee in exchange for Vince Carter and Ryan Anderson. He had his first triple-double as a member of the New Jersey Nets in 2009–2010. On January 5, 2010, he was released by the Nets in hopes of letting him play for a contender.

===Return to Miami (2010)===
On January 7, 2010, he cleared waivers and signed with the Miami Heat for the second time. After starting 25 games for Heat, Miami replaced Alston with Carlos Arroyo as starting point guard. In a press release, Miami stated that Alston &quot;made contact with the team via text message...has made himself otherwise unavailable to the team&quot; and he was immediately suspended on March 6, 2010, for missing practice and a game. On March 13, 2010, Miami upgraded his suspension for the remainder of the season. Thus, Alston&#x27;s final NBA game was played on March 2, 2010, in a 110106 win over the Golden State Warriors. In Alston&#x27;s final game, although he was the Heat&#x27;s starting point guard, he only played for 7 minutes and the only stat he recorded was 1 rebound.

===Zhejiang Lions (2011)===
On January 26, 2011, Alston signed with the Zhejiang Lions in the CBA for the remainder of the season. In late February, it was reported that he had left the team to attend a friend&#x27;s funeral, and the team, believing he was unlikely to return because he had been injured and refused to see a doctor, told him to not return. Alston played 8 games for the Lions and averaged 19.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists.

===Los Angeles D-Fenders (2012)===
In 2012, Alston signed with the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League. This would be his last run as a professional basketball player.

==Legal troubles==

During 1998, he was convicted of assaulting two neighbors in Fresno.

On Sunday morning, August 5, 2007, Alston was arrested in downtown Houston on misdemeanor charges of assault and public intoxication. The charges brought against Alston for the incident were dropped on February 29, 2008.[5]

He was also arrested on August 7, 2008, and charged with DWI.

He was arrested yet again early Tuesday morning, August 28, 2007, in New York for allegedly slashing a man on the neck during a nightclub altercation. Neither the club owner, police, nor security tapes have provided any evidence of the incident occurring.

<text>China competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s ninth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in 1952. A total of 384 Chinese athletes, 136 men and 248 women, were selected by the Chinese Olympic Committee to compete in 28 sports. For the third time in its Olympic history, China was represented by more female than male athletes.

China left Athens with a total of 63 Olympic medals – 32 golds, 17 silver, and 14 bronze – finishing third in the overall medal standings and second only to the United States in the gold medal tally. The Chinese delegation proved particularly successful in several sports, winning nine medals each in diving and shooting, eight in weightlifting, six in table tennis, and five each in badminton and judo. Chinese athletes dominated in badminton, diving, and table tennis, where they each won gold medals in most sporting events. Three Chinese athletes managed to defend their titles from the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, while six of them won more than a single medal in Athens. China&#x27;s team-based athletes came strong and successful in Athens, as the women&#x27;s volleyball team managed to strike the Russians for the gold medal.

Among the nation&#x27;s medalists were hurdler Liu Xiang, who emerged as China&#x27;s first male athlete to win an Olympic gold medal in men&#x27;s track and field, badminton player Zhang Ning in the women&#x27;s singles, diving tandem Wu Minxia and Guo Jingjing in the women&#x27;s synchronized platform, and tennis players Li Ting and Sun Tiantian, who became the first Asians to capture an Olympic title in the women&#x27;s doubles. Badminton player Gao Ling, who won a gold and a silver in both the mixed doubles with Zhang Jun and the women&#x27;s doubles with Huang Sui, became the most decorated Chinese athlete in the sporting history with a total of four Olympic medals. Along with Zhang Jun and Gao Ling for their Olympic defense campaign, taekwondo jin Chen Zhong successfully repeated her gold medal from Sydney in the women&#x27;s heavyweight division.

With Beijing being the host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics, a traditional Chinese segment directed by Zhang Yimou was performed during the closing ceremony.

<doc id="914166" wikidata="Q867842" url="?curid=914166" title="Classic Queen">
<text>Classic Queen is a 1992 compilation album by the British rock band Queen. The album was seen as a US version of &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; and was issued to capitalize on the renewed popularity of Queen in the United States following the release of the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; and the death of Freddie Mercury. The album reached number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified three times platinum in the US and five times platinum in Canada.
Accumulated sales (&quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; and &quot;Classic Queen&quot; for the US and Canada combined) are in excess of 25 million worldwide.

==Content and release==
Although well received, &quot;Classic Queen&quot; did not fit in with the previous Queen compilations. Its track listing overlapped with both the 1981 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and the 1991 import &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; albums and contained a few tracks not found on either of the previous releases. To remedy this situation, Hollywood Records re-released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; six months later in 1992 in the US only, containing two different tracks from the UK edition. This was an effort to make it a companion collection with &quot;Classic Queen&quot;. The two compilations had near-identical covers, with &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; having a red background, while &quot;Classic Queen&quot; had royal blue. As the two were seen as counterparts, many of Queen&#x27;s biggest hits which had appeared on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; were left off &quot;Classic Queen&quot;, such as &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;.

There was also a video cassette version of the album released (modelled after the &quot;Greatest Flix II&quot; video), but long out of print. It contained the &#x27;Wayne&#x27;s World&#x27; version of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, plus newly created videos for &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, &quot;One Year of Love&quot; and &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;.

Following Hollywood Records officially rereleasing the original 1981 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in 2004 and issuing &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; in North America since 19 April 2011 individually, both the 1992 version of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Classic Queen&quot; are out of print, save for a 2014 limited-edition Canadian reissue of the latter.

<text>Northwestern Ontario is a secondary region of Northern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario which lies north and west of Lake Superior and west of Hudson Bay and James Bay. It includes most of subarctic Ontario. Its western boundary is the Canadian province of Manitoba, which disputed Ontario&#x27;s claim to the western part of the region. Ontario&#x27;s right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884 and confirmed by the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In 1912, the Parliament of Canada by the &quot;Ontario Boundaries Extension Act&quot; gave jurisdiction over the District of Patricia to Ontario, thereby extending the northern boundary of the province to Hudson Bay.

==Geographic subdivisions==
Northwestern Ontario consists of the districts of Kenora, Rainy River and Thunder Bay. Major communities in the region include Thunder Bay, Kenora, Dryden, Fort Frances, Sioux Lookout, Greenstone, Red Lake, Marathon, and Atikokan. There are also several dozen First Nations in Northwestern Ontario.

==Time zones==
Northwestern Ontario is divided between the Eastern Time Zone and the Central Time Zone.

==Population==

Northwestern Ontario is the province&#x27;s most sparsely populated region: 54% of the region&#x27;s entire population lives in the Thunder Bay census metropolitan area alone. Aside from Thunder Bay, Kenora is the only other municipality in the entire region with a population greater than 10,000.

The overall population of Northwestern Ontario declined in the early 21st century, mainly because of a downturn in the forestry sector, but some individual municipalities within the region have seen modest population growth over the period.

==Politics==

Northwestern Ontarians tend to lean left politically, mainly due to the history and influence of labour unions. At the federal level, Northwestern Ontario is represented by Liberal MPs Marcus Powlowski in Thunder Bay—Rainy River and Patty Hajdu in Thunder Bay—Superior North, as well as Conservative MP Eric Melillo in the Kenora District. Provincially, PC Greg Rickford represents Kenora—Rainy River, NDP Sol Mamakwa represents Kiiwetinoong, PC Ken Holland represents Thunder Bay—Atikokan, and Liberal Michael Gravelle represents Thunder Bay—Superior North.

In 2005, some residents of the region expressed dissatisfaction at the level of attention paid to the region by the provincial government. Some, most notably former Kenora mayor Dave Canfield, and Fort Frances town councillor Tannis Drysdale, have proposed the idea of the region as a whole, or parts of it, seceding from Ontario to join Manitoba, although the campaign did not attract widespread public support.

<doc id="914170" wikidata="Q3010954" url="?curid=914170" title="USS Atlanta (1884)">
<text>USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; was a protected cruiser and one of the first steel warships of the &quot;New Navy&quot; of the 1880s. In some references she is combined with as the &quot;Atlanta&quot; class, in others as the &quot;Boston&quot; class.

&quot;Atlanta&quot; was laid down on 8 November 1883 at Chester, Pennsylvania by Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works; launched on 9 October 1884; sponsored by Miss Jessie Lincoln, the daughter of Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln and granddaughter of President Abraham Lincoln; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 19 July 1886, Captain Francis M. Bunce in command.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Atlanta&quot; was ordered as part of the &quot;ABCD&quot; ships, the others being the cruisers and and the dispatch vessel . All were ordered from the same shipyard, John Roach &amp; Sons of Chester, Pennsylvania. However, when Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney initially refused to accept &quot;Dolphin&quot;, claiming her design was defective, the Roach yard went bankrupt and &quot;Atlanta&quot; was completed at the New York Navy Yard, which had little experience with steel-hulled ships.

As-built armament included two /30 caliber Mark 1 guns, six /30 caliber Mark 2 guns, two 6-pounder () rapid fire guns, two 3-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, two 1-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, and two .45 caliber (11.4 mm) Gatling guns. The 8-inch guns were initially in open barbettes with gun shields added later.

Armor protection was light, with 2-inch (50.8 mm) gun shields and conning tower, and a 1.5-inch (38.1 mm) deck extending over the machinery spaces.

The as-built engineering plant included eight coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers producing steam and a horizontal compound engine producing driving one shaft. Like the other &quot;ABCD&quot; ships, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was built with a sail rig to increase cruising range, though it was later removed. The ship carried up to 490 tons of coal, with a cruising range as built of at .

===Refit===
In 1897–1899 &quot;Atlanta&quot; received a new triple-expansion steam engine of and the 6-inch guns were converted to rapid firing with brass case ammunition replacing powder bags.

==Service history==
&quot;Atlanta&quot; remained at New York fitting out and undergoing modifications until July 1887, when she joined the North Atlantic Squadron. For a little over two years, she cruised the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the West Indies. On 30 September 1889, she was reassigned to the Squadron of Evolution with which she voyaged to Europe and the Mediterranean that winter. On the return voyage the protected cruiser paid a friendship visit to the Republic of Brazil before returning to New York at the end of July 1890. There, she resumed duty along the east coast and in the West Indies. Between February and April 1891, she cruised the Gulf of Mexico. From May–October, the ship operated along the Atlantic coast and participated in exercises and maneuvers at Boston and New York, training members of the Naval Militia. Between October 1891 and July 1892, she served successively along the east coast, in the West Indies, and in South American waters.

On 2 September 1892, the cruiser was transferred from the Squadron of Evolution back to the North Atlantic Squadron. Between December 1892 and February 1893, she operated in the West Indies protecting American interests. From March–May, the warship participated in the Naval Review held at Hampton Roads, Virginia. In May–June, she returned to the Gulf of Mexico. On 18 July 1893, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was placed out of commission at Norfolk, Virginia. There, she remained until recommissioned on 2 April 1894. She returned to duty on the North Atlantic station for the next 17 months. During that assignment, she put a landing party ashore at Boca del Toro, Colombia, on 8 March 1895 to protect American lives and property threatened by a Liberal Party revolt and the activity of filibusters. In September 1895, she was placed out of commission at the New York Navy Yard where she was laid up for the next five years.

On 15 September 1900, she was placed back in commission at New York, Comdr. E. C. Pendleton in command. Late in October, the ship put to sea to join the South Atlantic Squadron off the coast of Brazil. She cruised those waters until November 1902 when she was transferred to the Caribbean Squadron. During the latter tour of duty, she again landed shore parties to protect American interests; first at Santo Domingo in April 1903 and then at Porto Bello, Panama, the following December. She made a voyage to the Mediterranean in 1904 and returned in October, via the western coast of Africa and Cape Town, to the South Atlantic station. She arrived back at Hampton Roads on 26 December and, in January 1905, moved to Annapolis, Maryland, where she was placed in reserve on 12 January. &quot;Atlanta&quot; remained inactive only until 8 May, at which time she was returned to full commission for service in the Coast Squadron to participate in midshipman training missions. In November 1905, the warship moved to Norfolk where she served as a barracks ship for sailors of the Torpedo Flotilla until 1909. At that time, she moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where she resumed duty as a barracks ship. On 23 March 1912, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was relieved of duty, and on 24 April her name was struck from the Navy List. The ship was sold at Charleston on 10 June to Frank Rijsdyk&#x27;s (ship scrapping yard).

<doc id="914171" wikidata="Q926595" url="?curid=914171" title="Samson Occom">
<text>Samson Occom (1723 – July 14, 1792; also misspelled as Occum and Alcom) was a member of the Mohegan nation, from near New London, Connecticut, who became a Presbyterian cleric. Occom was the second Native American to publish his writings in English (after son-in-law Joseph Johnson (Mohegan/Brothertown) whose letter to Moses Paul, published April 1772, preceded Occom&#x27;s by 6 months), the first Native American to write down his autobiography, and also helped found several settlements, including what ultimately became known as the Brothertown Indians. Together with the missionary John Eliot, Occom became one of the foremost missionaries who cross-fertilised Native American communities with Christianized European culture.

==Early life and education==
Born to Joshua Tomacham and his wife Sarah, Occom is believed to be a descendant of Uncas, the notable Mohegan chief. According to his autobiography, at the age of 16 or 17, Occom heard the teachings of Christian evangelical preachers in the Great Awakening. He began to study theology at the &quot;Lattin School&quot; of Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock in 1743 and stayed for four years until leaving to begin his own career. In addition to improving his English, Occom learned to read and speak Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. As a young man, the only book he owned was the Bible. From 1747 until 1749, Occom worked under and studied with the Reverend Solomon Williams in New London, Connecticut.

==Career==

Occom became a teacher, preacher, and judge among the Montaukett Native Americans in Montauk, eastern Long Island, and married Mary Fowler, a Montaukett woman. Occom helped some of the Pequot peoples he worked with assimilate and adopt European-style houses, dress and culture.

He was officially ordained a minister on August 30, 1759, by the presbytery of Suffolk. Occom was never paid the same salary as white preachers, although promised he would be. The Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge also gave Occom a stipend for some time, but he lived in deep poverty for much of his life.

In 1761 and 1763, Occom traveled to the Six Nations of the Iroquois in upstate New York to preach. Winning few converts, he returned to teach at Mohegan, Connecticut, near New London. Occom mediated the conflicts between the colonists and the Native Americans because he was very familiar with colonist culture and through Occom&#x27;s missionary work he was recognized as a leader that strengthened Native American relations.

Wheelock had meanwhile established an Indian charity school in Lebanon, Connecticut, in 1754 with a legacy from Joshua Moor (among others). Upon Occom&#x27;s return to Mohegan, Wheelock persuaded his former pupil to travel to England to raise money for the school. Occom sailed from Boston December 23, 1765, and did not return until May 20, 1768. He preached his way across Britain from February 16, 1766, to July 22, 1767, delivering between 300 and 400 sermons, drawing large crowds wherever he went, and raising over £12,000 for Wheelock&#x27;s project. King George III donated 200 pounds, and William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, subscribed 50 guineas. However, Occom on his return learned that Wheelock had failed to care for Occom&#x27;s wife and children while he was away. Furthermore, Wheelock moved to New Hampshire and used the funds raised to establish Dartmouth College (named after the English earl) for the education of the sons of American colonists, rather than Native Americans as had originally been promised to Occom. Even 200 years later, the college had graduated less than 20 Native American students.

In 1764, Occom opposed the sale of tribal lands and was involved in the “Mason Controversy,” a long lasting dispute over land between the colonists and the Mohegans. The Mohegans formed an alliance with the Mason family to plead a case for the governor of Connecticut to give back the lands to the Mohegans. When Occom came back to Mohegans, he expressed his support for the Mason family and the Mohegans which caused the missionaries to make threats like taking away his preacher&#x27;s license and to stop financing his missionary work. The colonists also started to spread bad rumors about Occom, especially about how he was an alcoholic and how he converted to Christianity just for show. In a 1769 letter, Wheelock wrote to Occom about a rumor about Occom being an alcoholic. The rumor hurt Occom&#x27;s reputation after Occom&#x27;s success in fundraising money in England. Wheelock suggested that Occom truly does not care for Christianity.  The stereotype of the drunk Indian was put onto Occom and undermined his missionary work. Wheelock benefited from the defamation of Occom as Wheelock got back his authority. Wheelock&#x27;s letter further put forth the concept of fake conversion onto Occom and that Occom was not to be trusted as a preacher.
In 1768, Occom wrote &quot;A Short Narrative of My Life&quot;, a ten-page manuscript now held in Dartmouth College&#x27;s archive collection; however, it was not published until 1982. The document expands upon a single-page biography that Occom wrote before his preaching tour of England and Scotland. Occom also published &quot;Sermon at the Execution of Moses Paul&quot; and &quot;A Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot; in 1774. All of these documents provide a very different perspective on the relations between colonists and Native Americans from Mary Rowlandson&#x27;s narrative of her captivity in similar areas a century earlier.

==Ministry and later life==
Upon his return from England, Occom lived with his Mohegan people. After Wheelock&#x27;s betrayal, Occom together with son-in-law Joseph Johnson, brothers-in-law David and Jacob Fowler, and others, worked to organize the Christian (or “praying”) Indians of New England and Long Island into a new tribe in Upstate New York. On October 4, 1774, the Oneida ceded land to the East Coast Indians and by 1775, the initial group had begun to migrate. Burnt out at the outset of the Revolution, many went to Massachusetts to live among the Stockbridge until their return in 1785. Occom, his son-in-law Joseph Johnson (who had been a messenger for General George Washington during the American Revolution), and his Montauk brother-in-law David Fowler led the people back to rebuild their settlement (near what is now Waterville, New York) called Brothertown.

The Oneida also invited other Christian Indians to live with them, namely the Stockbridge Mohican from land claimed by western Massachusetts and two Lenape groups from the southern New Jersey area. The Mohicans founded what they called New Stockbridge in New York, near Oneida Lake. Occom not only assured that these villages received official civil charters in 1787, but also evicted white settlers from Brothertown on April 12, 1792.

Occom died on July 14, 1792, in New Stockbridge. He is said to be buried just off Bogusville Hill Road outside of Deansboro, New York.

==Legacy==
After Occom&#x27;s death, during the 1820s, many Brothertown Indians and some Oneida accepted payment from New York State for their land and were removed to what is now known as the town of Brothertown in Calumet County, Wisconsin. In the modern era, the Brothertown Indians petitioned the federal government for recognition as a tribe, but were denied and have appealed.

Several locations around Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, are named after Occom, including Occom Pond and Occom Ridge on the college campus&#x27;s northern edge, at . The Native American Studies program has a Samson Occom professorship. The Occom Commons community space is part of Goldstein Hall in the recently opened McLaughlin Residential Cluster. Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Connecticut, also named a residence hall for upperclassmen after Occom.

The Norwich, Connecticut neighborhood of Occum is named for Samson Occom.

The Brothertown Indians celebrate Samson Occom Day as an official Tribal holiday every July 14.

On April 27, 2019, the Native American Alumni Association of Dartmouth College erected a memorial on the site of Moor&#x27;s Charity School in Columbia, CT, &quot;commemorating and honoring Samson Occom for his contributions to the education of Native Americans and the founding of Dartmouth College.&quot;

<text>Eugene William Oates (31 December 184516 November 1911) was an English naturalist and a civil engineer who worked on road projects in Burma.

Oates was born in Sicily and educated in Bath, England. For a time he attended Sydney College, Bath and later under private tutors. He was a civil servant in the Public Works Department in India and Burma from 1867 to 1899. He retired to England, where he compiled a catalogue of the birds&#x27; eggs in the Natural History Museum, and served as secretary of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union from 1898 to 1901.

He died in Edgbaston.

A species of Indian snake, &quot;Typhlops oatesii&quot;, a Burmese frog, &quot;Humerana oatesii&quot;, and seven species of birds are named in his honor.

<doc id="914179" wikidata="Q1683216" url="?curid=914179" title="Japanese domestic market">
<text>The term &quot;Japanese domestic market&quot; (&quot;JDM&quot;) refers to Japan&#x27;s home market for vehicles and vehicle parts. Japanese owners contend with a strict motor vehicle inspection and grey markets. JDM is also incorrectly used as a term colloquially to refer to cars produced in Japan but sold in other countries.

The average age of JDM cars is 8.7 years, ranking 9th in a survey of 30 of the top 50 countries by gross domestic product. According to the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile, a car in Japan travels a yearly average of over only , less than half the U.S. average of .

Japanese domestic market vehicles may differ greatly from the cars that Japanese manufacturers build for export and vehicles derived from the same platforms built in other countries. The Japanese car owner looks more toward innovation than long-term ownership which forces Japanese carmakers to refine new technologies and designs first in domestic vehicles. For instance, the 2003 Honda Inspire featured the first application of Honda&#x27;s Variable Cylinder Management. However, the 2003 Honda Accord V6, which was the same basic vehicle, primarily intended for the North American market, did not feature VCM, which had a poor reputation after Cadillac&#x27;s attempt in the 1980s with the V8-6-4 engine. VCM was successfully introduced to the Accord V6 in its redesign for 2008.

In 1988, JDM cars were limited by voluntary self-restraints among manufacturers to and a top speed of , limits imposed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) for safety. The horsepower limit was lifted in 2004 but the speed limit of remains.

==Motorcycle power and speed restrictions==

For many years Japan had severe restrictions on the maximum power and speed that motorcycles could have.

All motorcycles for the Japanese domestic market were restricted to .

Power restrictions were as follows 

===Pre-1993===
*250cc class: 
*400cc class: 
*750cc class: 
*over 750cc: not allowed

===Post-1993===
*250cc class: 
*400cc class: 
*750cc class: 
*over 750cc: allowed, but restricted to 

==VIN==
Japanese carmakers do not use a vehicle identification number as is common overseas. Instead, they use either a frame number, chassis number, or vehicle ID number and also a model code as well as an emissions code to identify their vehicles. The frame number identifies the vehicles model and serial number. For example, frame number SV30-0169266 breaks down as &quot;SV30&quot; identifying the model as Toyota Camry/Vista and &quot;0169266&quot; being the serial number of the vehicle. The model code designates the vehicle&#x27;s model number and features. As an example, ST205-BLMVZ breaks down as &quot;ST205&quot;, which means it is a third generation Toyota Celica GT-FOUR, and &quot;BLMVZ&quot; which designates a set of features incorporated in the vehicle. The Emissions Code refers to the vehicle&#x27;s designated emission standard at the time, usually being placed before the vehicle&#x27;s model number, and with the five most commonly used designations being E, GF, GH, ABA, and CBA. These codes are only seen on JDM models and are not present on exported models of the same type. Examples would include E-EK9 or GF-EK9 from the first generation Civic Type R, E-BNR32 from the R32 Skyline GT-R, E-JZX100 from the eight generation Mark II. Another useful example to help differentiate between pure JDM models and export examples is the code JHMEEG6 on the European Civic VTi models and E-EG6 on the Japanese fifth generation Civic SiR trims. Correct identification of the chassis code using these markers would help prove the authenticity of the model.

==Worldwide popularity==
===Motorcycles===
In the &#x27;90s the JDM power restrictions along with license restrictions that made it difficult to be licensed on larger motorcycles resulted in a number of models that were not offered anywhere else in the world, with 250cc and 400cc miniature replicas of the bigger 750cc &amp; 900cc bikes.

At the same time, Japan had particularly tough laws regarding road licensing and sales regulations. Any motorcycle more powerful than 250cc had to take an extensively stringent test every two years.

Combining these factors with a virtually non-existent second-hand market made it economic to export the nearly new bikes abroad where they were eagerly bought and a number of import specialists sprung up to cater for this &quot;grey import&quot; market of relatively inexpensive but interesting motorcycles.

In the later &#x27;90s as Japan&#x27;s economy fell into recession it became less profitable to export and Japanese owners held on to their bikes for longer. The last global crash all but ended the &quot;grey import&quot; industry with the big specialist importers closing down.

===Cars===

Cars manufactured for the Japanese domestic market have been growing in popularity since the late 1990s.

Ex-Japan Imports are also very common in New Zealand where 59% of vehicles registered on New Zealand roads originated from overseas markets as opposed to 41% of which were delivered NZ-New. Of this, 94% originate from Japan.
New Zealand imported an average of 134,834 JDM vehicles per year in the period 2015–2019, the majority of which were Mazda 3 (Axela), Suzuki Swift, Nissan Tiida, Toyota Corolla and Mazda 2 (Demio). Other models popular for importation in previous years include exotic vehicles (Honda Torneo, Nissan Skyline, Nissan Laurel and Toyota Altezza), and kei cars (Suzuki Carry, Daihatsu Move, Subaru R2). Due to the popularity of used imports from Japan, and their relatively poor crash-test ratings, the New Zealand Ministry of Transport is currently investigating tougher restrictions on imported vehicles, most notably on the importation of the Toyota Corolla, Mazda 2 (Demio) and Suzuki Swift.

In 2004, importing JDM cars became popular in Canada as highly sought after vehicles, such as the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, became eligible to import under Canada&#x27;s 15-year rule. In contrast, importing grey market vehicles into the United States is much more difficult. To avoid regulatory problems, most private individuals wait until EPA restrictions no longer apply to the desired vehicle, which is done on a rolling 25-year cycle.

===Railways===
Ex-Japan import rolling stocks in all kinds is no exception on this list, although it can be considered as JDM but in special case since this was also intended for Japanese market which were mostly acquired by leading private railway companies across Japan such as Japan Railways, even subways such as Tokyo Metro, Tokyu Corporation, Toei Subway and so forth which was in demand for modernizing railway system in most developing countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar to acquire used trains from Japan rather than procuring brand-new rolling stocks, there are some cases that the management from each respective railway companies in Japan such as Japan Railways are decided to donate them to the oversea country, instead of scrapping them ahead in no time, which is really needed for a major upgrade and sign their agreement that the recipient of the oversea country will pay for its freight expenses and the rest will be free.
Here are different categories of used rolling stocks listed which were mostly shipped and operated overseas in different countries.

*Electric Multiple Unit

*Diesel Multiple Unit
*Passenger Cars
*Locomotives

===Retail Shops===
Outside of Japan, there are various shops which they sell various kinds of used items from Japan. Philippines is one of the known countries outside Japan to set up a retail outlet called, &quot;Japan Surplus Shop&quot; which is found in most towns of the country. They used to sell used appliances, furnitures, gadgets, accessories, and even bicycles designed for women, are still much more preferred by local buyers because of being more affordable than buying those newly locally made home furnitures, or even new gadgets which is becoming more dominating mostly coming from China and so forth. Most of these items depending on the condition.

==Commercial vehicles==
=== Buses ===
In the early 1990s, Ex-Japanese buses had been rising popular and been common in the developing cities across Asia such as Manila, Philippines, Jakarta, Indonesia &amp; even Yangon, Myanmar.

Like in the Philippines, direct importers near ports in Subic, Zambales &amp; Cagayan Valley have started their auction business to import quality vehicles preferably from Japan. And then so, most of the clients who are mostly operating bus companies based in Manila, Philippines began their interest to grow their transport business thru buying Japan surplus buses from all cities in Japan which are definitely cheaper than buying brand-new ones which are mostly imported from other countries and some are locally assembled coach bodies but still at an expensive price.

Used buses like in the Philippines also requires to convert from RHD to LHD conversion which is in compliance with the Philippine traffic law called Republic Act No. 8506 entitled &quot;An act banning the registration and operation of vehicles with right-hand steering wheel in any private or public street, road or highway, providing penalties therefor and for other purposes.&quot; A violation of this law is punished by imprisonment for a period from two years, four months, and one day, up to four years and two months, plus a fine of 50,000 pesos (approx. $1,000). And most of the used buses from Japan in Manila, Philippines are mostly operating within the city and intercity travel which are at least 10 years of age after being phased out in Japan.

=== Trucks ===
As early also in the 1990s, there is no exception that there will be a Japanese domestic market trucks to be called as &quot;Japan Surplus Trucks&quot; for auction &amp; export to any of the developing cities in Asia and even including Russia. Most of the Japanese domestic market trucks that have been exported are Isuzu, Mitsubishi Fuso, Hino and some are Nissan Diesel. These trucks are also proven much reliable and durable since domestic trucks in Japan has no exception for the 10 to 15 year phased out due to the compliance of Japan&#x27;s existing traffic &amp; environmental regulations and also to avoid any taxes once any domestic truck unit surpassed the age limit to be phasing out.

Japanese domestic market trucks, or &#x27;surplus trucks&#x27; after being phased-out in Japan, are extremely popular in the Philippines such as Isuzu Elf, Isuzu Forward, Isuzu Giga, Mitsubishi Canter, Mitsubishi Fuso Super Great &amp; Hino Profia since they are popularly cheaper than buying a brand-new Japanese trucks which are locally distributed and even brand-new trucks from China which is about thrice as expensive as an ordinary used Japanese domestic truck units. Auctioneers in the Philippines also started importing trucks in the 1990s and it had been a staple for every small to medium business enterprise owner particularly in the logistics industry to support and to grow their respective businesses as well aside from being cheap than buying new ones, but also really proven that they are built to last.

Another category for Japanese trucks are the smallest ones, or to be called as kei truck, they are also extremely popular in the Philippines once again to be called as &quot;multicab&quot; which are often reconditioned &amp; converted to any public transportation vehicle like jeepney since they are lighter, more economical, more environmentally friendly than the conventional Philippine jeepneys which are mostly powered by used diesel engines from Japan.

Truck engines from Japan also became a boom hit among small workshops and mostly being supplied by local manufacturers in the Philippines which they made Philippine Jeepneys since the 1980s. Popular truck engines being supplied are Isuzu &amp; Mitsubishi Fuso Canter, sometimes, depending from the local clients, they often requested to supply diesel engines from Mazda and Nissan to install them not just for jeepneys, but also called as AUV which is being used for daily commercial use or can be for private use who often they don&#x27;t have enough budget than buying a brand-new AUVs offered in the Philippine market during those times such as Toyota Kijang, Mitsubishi Adventure, Mitsubishi L300 van or even Isuzu Crosswind

== JDM-related components ==

=== Speed chime ===

For a couple of decades, JDM specification model of vehicles often included a speed chime (:ja:速度警告音) which rings when a driver exceeds for standard cars and for kei cars. This speed chime was first mandated on November 21, 1974, according to Article 1 of the &quot;Ministerial Ordinance for Partial Revision of Safety Standards for Road Transport Vehicles&quot;. Under pressure from the United States and other foreign producers, this requirement was removed in 1986 with &quot;Ministerial Ordinance for Partial Revision of Safety Standards for Road Transport Vehicles&quot; (Ministry of Transport Ordinance No. 3 of 1986) as being a non-tariff barrier. An additional problem was that the repetitive sound could induce sleep in drowsy drivers. Some models used electromechanical glockenspiel-type systems, while other models used a buzzer. Due to that, nickname for speed chime is &quot;kinkon&quot; (キンコン), an onomatopoeia for a clanging sound.

Several manufacturers continued to offer speed chimes as an option until the early 2000s. The last vehicle to come with the speed chime as standard factory fitment was the Honda City GA1/GA2.

Initial D anime features this speed chime prominently on Takumi Fujiwara&#x27;s AE86.

=== Speed indicator light ===

JDM specification model of trucks (over 5 ton loading capacity, 8 ton gross vehicle weight) was mandated to have speed indicator installed from August 1967, according to Article 48 of the Ministerial Ordinance &quot;Safety Standards for Road Vehicles&quot; based on the provisions of Chapter 3 of the Road Vehicle Law.

The speed indicator light is only mandated for large trucks and is not necessary for small and medium-sized trucks and large buses, but installation on these vehicles are not prohibited. Speed indicator is installed in front of the cab, or up in the roof.

Article 48 of the Ministerial Ordinance &quot;Safety Standards for Road Vehicles&quot; based on the provisions of Chapter 3 of the Road Vehicle Law for speed indicator light is as following (modified and also translated):

# The speed indicator device shall be of a structure that automatically turns on the following number of lights (thereinafter referred to as &quot;speed indicator lights&quot;) when traveling at the speeds listed in the table below.
## 40 km/h or less (*): 1 light
## Over 40 km/h up to 60 km/h: 2 lights
## Over 60 km/h: 3 lights
# The speed indicator lamp shall not be equipped with a manual switch or the like that can easily turn off the speed indicator lamp, except for the power switch of the vehicle.
# The number of speed indicator lights that are on must be visible from a distance of 100m ahead.
# The light color of the speed indicator lamp shall be yellow-green.
# The display of the speed indicator lamp must be free of significant error when driving on flat paved roads.
# The speed display device shall be equipped with a light or other device that enables the driver to confirm its operating state from the driver&#x27;s seat (usually they are located on speedometer).

Patterns for speed indicator is as following:
==== Abolishment and decline ====
Enacted in 1967, this obligatory speed indicator light has proved a non-tariff barrier for European and American manufacturers. Imported heavy-duty trucks had to be modified to meet this certification requirement. Additionally, most people on Japanese roads never knew how to interpret the speed indicator lights. Therefore, this requirement was abolished in 2001. Instead, truck manufacturers now have to install speed limiters which activate at around .

==JDM-inspired vehicles==

Some car enthusiasts like to build replicas of JDM vehicles from locally available cars. For example, enthusiasts in the USA will often take a US-market Honda Civic (sixth generation), convert it from left-hand-drive to right-hand-drive and source the required parts such as the engine and gearbox from the JDM EK9 Type R - which is based on the same platform - in order to make an &#x27;exact&#x27; copy. Other forms of &quot;JDM Conversions&quot; include converting a USDM model first generation Subaru Impreza and fitting JDM STi parts to make it seem as if it is a genuine WRX STi model. In Southeast Asia, it is common practice to convert a base model Mitsubishi Lancer and swap out the necessary parts, right down to the cutting of the floor pan, and create a Lancer Evolution copy.

However, cars such as this would not be authentic JDM cars as they would possess a United States vehicle identification number. It is also to be noted that, even with such modifications, it is impossible to recreate the running performance of the original car, as there are many engineering aspects which cannot be replicated by means of &quot;conversion&quot; alone. A good example would be body strengthening methods using spot welding and extra reinforcement on strut mounting points, stress areas in joints, etc. as found in the Lancer Evolution and EK9 Type R models. These reinforcements are not present on base model sixth generation hatchbacks and Mitsubishi Lancers. Hence, replicas or conversions would be similar from a visual standpoint only, as they lack the same level of structural rigidity as the original counterpart.

<text>Stepanakert or Khankendi is a city in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. The city was under the control and the capital city of the breakaway Republic of Artsakh prior to the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive in the region. The city is located in a valley on the eastern slopes of the Karabakh mountain range, on the left bank of the Qarqarçay (Karkar) river.

The area that would become Stepanakert was originally an Armenian settlement named Vararakn. During the Soviet period, the city was made the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, becoming a hub for economic and industrial activity. In addition, the city became a hotbed for political activity, serving as the center for Armenian demonstrations calling for the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia. Stepanakert suffered extensive damage following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the outbreak of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War and passed into the hands of local Armenians with the establishment of the Republic of Artsakh. During the Soviet and Artsakh periods, the city was a regional center of education and culture, being home to Artsakh University, musical schools, and a palace of culture. The economy was based on the service industry and had varied enterprises, food processing, wine making, and silk weaving being the most important. As of 2021, the population of Stepanakert was 75,000.

In September 2023, Azerbaijani authorities took control of the city, with almost the entire Armenian population forced to flee to Armenia ahead of the advancing Azerbaijani forces. It was an abandoned ghost city for a year; Azerbaijan began settling new permanent residents in the city in September 2024 with the opening of Karabakh University.

==Etymology==
Medieval Armenian sources attest to a settlement in the locale called &quot;Vararakn&quot; (). In 1847, the village was officially renamed from Vararakn to Khankendi by the Russian authorities; however, Vararakn remained the local Armenian name for the town until 1923.

Most Azerbaijani sources claim that the settlement was built in late 18th century, as a place of rest for the heads of the Karabakh Khanate. In the first years, it was known as &quot;Khan&#x27;s village&quot; () because only the khan&#x27;s family and his relatives lived there. By the 19th century, the settlement was renamed &quot;Khankendi&quot; (&quot;village of the khan&quot; in Azerbaijani).

The town was renamed &quot;Stepanakert&quot; () on 20 September 1923, after Armenian Bolshevik revolutionary Stepan Shahumian. The name is formed from the words &quot;Stepan&quot; () and &quot;kert&quot; ().

==History==
===Founding and Soviet era===

According to medieval Armenian sources, the settlement was originally an Armenian village named Vararakn (). From the 10th–16th centuries, the settlement was a part of the Armenian Principality of Khachen. Over the centuries, it would successively pass into the hands of the meliks of Karabakh and the Karabakh khans before coming under the control of the Russian Empire in 1822.

In the Russian Empire, the town was a part of the Shusha uezd of the Elizavetpol Governorate. According to the 19th-century author Raffi, in 1826, the local Armenian meliks met with the Persian crown prince Abbas Mirza, who had invaded Karabakh with his army, in the village to reconcile with the Persians and ensure the safety of the Karabakh Armenian population. In 1847, Vararakn was a village of about 132 houses, consisting of 80 Armenian households, 52 Russian households, an Armenian church, and a cemetery. That same year, the village was renamed from Vararakn to Khankendi. By 1886, there were 52 houses in the settlement. The population of Khankendi consisted of retired soldiers and their descendants, who belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church. The population was engaged in agriculture, as well as various crafts, carriage, the renting of apartments (mainly to military personnel), and so on. After 1898, the tsarist government turned Khankendi into a Russian military garrison. The garrison consisted of barracks, hospitals, and a church, as well as several houses where officers&#x27; families and a small local population, who supplied the military units with food, lived. The local population consisted of Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
In February 1920, after a body thought to be of an Azerbaijani soldier was found, an anti-Armenian riot took place in the village that claimed several hundred lives. Following the massacre of the Armenian population of Shusha in March 1920, the city received an influx of Armenians; as a result, Armenians formed the majority of the population from that time onwards. In the summer of 1920, the city was occupied by part of the Red Army. In 1923, Khankendi was renamed Stepanakert by the Soviet government in honor of Stepan Shahumian, a fallen Bolshevik party member and leader of the 26 Baku Commissars. The former regional capital was Shusha. However, following the depopulation of Armenians in Shusha, the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) was sited in Stepanakert. At the time of the formation of the NKAO, Stepanakert was a dilapidated settlement, where the number of surviving buildings barely reached 10 to 15. Some of the buildings were completely destroyed, others lacked doors and windows, while only walls remained from a number of buildings. During the first years of the oblast, some of the buildings were restored and many were rebuilt, roads were improved, and electricity and telephone communications were installed in the city. In time, Stepanakert grew to become the region&#x27;s most important city (a status it received in 1940). Its population rose from 10,459 in 1939 to 33,000 in 1978.

In 1926, municipal authorities adopted a new city layout designed by Aleksandr Tamanian; two additional designs for expansion were approved in the 1930s and 1960s, both of which retained Tamanian&#x27;s initial plan. Several schools and two polyclinics were established, and an Armenian drama theater was founded in 1932 and named after Maxim Gorky. In 1960, the ensemble of the central square of Stepanakert was built with the building of the regional committee (now the NKR government). This square, then named after Lenin, became the arena of many rallies demanding the transfer of the NKAO to the Armenian SSR. By 1968, the first outbreak of ethnic violence occurred in Stepanakert. In the city, a trial was held over an Azerbaijani director of the city school who was accused of murdering an Armenian girl. The Armenians, who considered the verdict of the Azerbaijani judge too lenient, gathered outside the court building and burned the car which the criminal and judge were in.

Stepanakert served as Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s main economic hub, and by the mid-1980s there were nineteen factories in operation in the city, including an electrical and asphalt plant. By the end of the Soviet era, Stepanakert had an agricultural technical school, a pedagogical institute, a medical and music school, a local history museum, and a drama theater.

===First Nagorno-Karabakh War and Armenian control===

The political and economic reforms that General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev undertook in 1985 saw a marked decentralization of Soviet authority. Armenians, in both the Armenian SSR and Nagorno-Karabakh, viewed Gorbachev&#x27;s reform program as an opportunity to unite the two together. On 20 February 1988, tens of thousands of Armenians gathered to demonstrate in Stepanakert&#x27;s Lenin Square (now Renaissance Square) to demand that the region be joined to Armenia. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join the Armenian SSR, a move strongly opposed by the Soviet Azerbaijani authorities.

Relations between Stepanakert&#x27;s Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who supported the Azerbaijani government&#x27;s position, deteriorated in the following years. Inter-ethnic strife in the city in September 1988, encompassing physical attacks and burning of property, forced nearly all Azerbaijanis to flee the city. The Soviet Army took up positions in the city and announced a curfew three days later. In 1990 the army dispatched special forces units and various other elements to Stepanakert in order to prevent its takeover by Azerbaijani forces.

After Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Stepanakert was renamed Khankendi by the Azerbaijani government. Fighting broke out over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which, after three years of war, resulted in Armenian control of the region and a connecting corridor to Armenia to the west. Prior to the conflict, Stepanakert was the largest city of the NKAO, with a population of 70,000 out of a total 189,000 (Armenians at the time comprised 75% of the region&#x27;s total population). By early 1992, that figure had dropped to 50,000.

During the war, the city suffered immense damage from Azerbaijani bombardment, especially in early 1992 when the Azerbaijanis positioned BM-21 Grad rocket artillery in Shusha and rained down missiles over Stepanakert. A journalist for &quot;Time&quot; noted in an April 1992 article that &quot;scarcely a single building [had] escaped damage in Stepanakert.&quot; It was not until 9 May 1992, with the capture of Shusha, that the ground bombardment ceased. The city, nevertheless, continued to suffer aerial bombardment until the end of the war. As a result, the majority of the city was in a severely damaged state. As of 2016, the city had not been completely restored from the war.

The city came under intense bombardment once again during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020. Residential areas were continuously hit by the Azerbaijani Army with cluster munitions throughout the war, starting on the first day of fighting, and residents were urged to use the city&#x27;s bomb shelters. As Azerbaijani forces advanced on the city of Shusha, the Lachin corridor was shut down by Artsakh authorities.

With Azerbaijani forces from the capital, a ceasefire agreement was signed on 10 November. As part of the agreement, Russian peacekeepers were deployed to the region. Following the war, the population of Stepanakert swelled to 75,000 residents as a result of some 10,000 to 15,000 displaced people who lost their homes elsewhere in the Republic of Artsakh during the war.

===Control by Azerbaijan===
On 19–20 September 2023 Azerbaijan launched a new offensive in the region, which ended in a ceasefire and led to a mass exodus of ethnic Armenians a few days later. By 29 September 2023, police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Artsakh left all their weapons in Stepanakert and completely abandoned the region. Azerbaijani police vehicles began patrolling the area on 29 September and the Azerbaijani flag was placed on the city&#x27;s &quot;We Are Our Mountains&quot; monument. From 1 October, Azerbaijani officials began working from the former Artsakh police headquarters, Azerbaijan took over responsibility for medical services in the city and its area was covered by the Azerbaijani mobile networks. An Al Jazeera news crew reported from the city later that day, showing deserted streets in what the reporter described as &quot;A ghost town with no soul left&quot;.

After the offensive and Armenian exodus, sources reported that Azerbaijani authorities issued a map of Stepanakert renaming one of the streets after Enver Pasha, one of the main perpetrators of the Armenian genocide. An Azerbaijani official disputed this during a case at the International Court of Justice, saying that &quot;No streets in Khankandi have been renamed&quot;.

President Ilham Aliyev visited the city on 15 October and officially raised the flag of Azerbaijan at the building that was previously used as the Artsakh Presidential Palace.

In December 2023, the first football match since the resumption of Azerbaijani control was played between MOIK Baku and Qarabağ FK from Aghdam in the Azerbaijan Cup.

In the following months, Azerbaijani authorities dismantled monuments symbolizing Artsakh, including the Giant Cross and the Eagle Monument, and statues of prominent Armenians in the city, among them, Stepan Shahumyan (after whom Stepanakert is named), Charles Aznavour and Alexander Myasnikyan.

In early March 2024, Azerbaijani authorities demolished the National Assembly of Artsakh Building and the Artsakh Freedom Fighters Union Building. In November 2024, reports emerged that Azerbaijan demolished the historical Armenian center of the city.

==Culture and economy==

In 1967, the monumental complex of Stepanakert known as &quot;We Are Our Mountains&quot; was erected to the north of Stepanakert, It is widely regarded as a symbol of the Armenian heritage of the historic Artsakh. After the independence of Armenia, many cultural and youth centres were reopened. The cultural palace of the city was named after Charles Aznavour.

Stepanakert was home to the Mesrop Mashtots Republican Library opened in 1924, Artsakh History Museum opened in 1939, Hovhannes Tumanyan Children&#x27;s Library opened in 1947, Stepanakert National Gallery opened in 1982, and the Memorial Museum of the Martyred Liberators opened in 2002.

===Education===

Stepanakert was the center of higher education in Artsakh. Five higher educational institutions operated in the city:
* Artsakh State University, founded in 1969 as a branch of the Baku Pedagogical Institute. In 1973, it was renamed Stepanakert Pedagogical Institute and following the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh, in 1992, it received its current status. The university offered courses spread across seven departments and has 4,500 students.
* Stepanakert campus of the Armenian National Agrarian University.
* Grigor Narekatsi University (private).

Many new schools in Stepanakert were opened from the late 1990s to 2010 with the help of the Armenian diaspora. Existing schools were also renovated with donations from the diaspora.

The Stepanakert branch of Tumo Center for Creative Technologies was opened in September 2015, as a result of continued cooperation between the Tumo Centre and the Armenian General Benevolent Union, with the support of mobile operator Karabakh Telecom.

===Sport===

Football was a popular sport in Nagorno-Karabakh and the city has a renovated football stadium. Since the mid-1990s, football teams from Karabakh started taking part in some domestic competitions in Armenia. Lernayin Artsakh is the football club that represents the city of Stepanakert. The Artsakh national football league was launched in 2009.

The non-FIFA affiliated Artsakh national football team was formed in 2012 and played their first competitive match against the unrecognized Abkhazia national football team in Sukhumi on 17 September 2012. The match ended with a 1–1 draw. The following month, on 21 October 2012, Artsakh played the return match at the Stepanakert Republican Stadium against Abkhazia, winning it with a result of 3–0.

Artsakh athletes also took part with the representing teams and athletes in the Pan-Armenian Games, organized in Armenia.

===Twin towns – sister cities===

Stepanakert was twinned with:
* Montebello, United States: On 25 September 2005, Montebello, California and Stepanakert became sister cities. This prompted a complaint by the ambassador of Azerbaijan to the United States, Hafiz Pashayev, who sent a letter to California leaders, stating that the decision jeopardized peace talks between his country and Armenia. The letter was sent to then-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who deferred the letter to Montebello mayor Bill Molinari since it concerned a local, not a state, issue. Molinari responded to Pashayev that the city would go ahead with its plans to inaugurate Stepanakert under the sister city program. Stepanakert&#x27;s relationship with Montebello is aimed at revitalizing the capital&#x27;s economic infrastructure and building cultural and educational ties, as well as developing trade and health care between the two cities. Azerbaijan has described this as a contradictory foreign policy of the United States that supports the NKR government and Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan.
* Mairiporã, Brazil: Since June 18, 2018, Law 3767/18 has made Eternal Armenia the name that declares Sister Cities the Municipalities of Mairiporã, State of São Paulo, and Stepanakert, capital of the self-declared Nagorno-Karabakh Republic which triggered an alert from Itamaraty, Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the attitude of the Municipality as Brazil does not recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The late-19th-century church of Vararakn was destroyed in the 1930s to build the Stepanakert Drama Theatre. Throughout the rest of the Soviet era, there were no traditional churches in Stepanakert, although most of the population of the city were members of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

The church of Surp Hakob (or &quot;Saint James&quot;) was opened in 2007; it remained the only open church in the city until 2019. The church was financed by Nerses Yepremian from Los Angeles. The church was consecrated on 9 May 2007, in honor of the 15th anniversary of the capture of Shusha by Armenian forces.

The construction of the Holy Mother of God Cathedral was launched on 19 July 2006. The cost of the project was expected to be around US$2 million and the architect of the church is Gagik Yeranosyan. However, the construction process was slow due to a lack of financial resources. The inauguration of the church was expected to take place in September 2016. Construction finished and the church was opened in 2019.

In the years following, the economy was developed further, mainly due to investments from the Armenian diaspora. However, following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, the economy once again experienced severe damage, particularly in the tourism sector.

Stepanakert was served by a number of regular minibus lines. Old Soviet-era buses have been replaced with new modern buses. Regular trips to other provinces of Nagorno-Karabakh were also operated from the city.

===Air===
Stepanakert was served by the nearby Stepanakert Airport, north of the city near the town of Khojaly. In 2009, facilities reconstruction and repair work began. Though originally scheduled to launch the first commercial flights on 9 May 2011, Karabakh officials postponed a new reopening date throughout the whole of 2011. In May 2012, the director of the NKR&#x27;s Civil Aviation Administration, Tigran Gabrielyan, announced that the airport would begin operations in summer 2012. However, the airport still remains closed due to political reasons. The OSCE Minsk Group, which mediates the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, stated that &quot;operation of [Stepanakert Airport] cannot be used to support any claim of a change in the status of Nagorno-Karabakh&quot; and &quot;urged the sides to act in accordance with international law and consistent with current practice for flights over their territory.&quot;

===Railway===
Stepanakert used to be connected through a railway line via Aghdam and Barda to the Yevlakh station on the Baku-Tbilisi railway. However, trips were discontinued due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

<text>Viatcheslav Vladimirovich Ekimov (Russian Вячеслав Владимирович Екимов; born 4 February 1966) is a Russian former professional racing cyclist. A triple Olympic gold medalist, he was awarded the title of Russian Cyclist of the Century in 2001.

==Biography==
Ekimov was born in Vyborg, and started training as a cyclist at age 12 with a bicycle school affiliated with the famous centre of Aleksandr Kuznetsov. He trained in Leningrad at Lokomotiv and later Armed Forces sports society during the Soviet era.

Ekimov won three Olympic gold medals: in the track team pursuit in Seoul (1988) for the USSR, and in an upset, in the road time trial in Sydney (2000) for Russia. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Ekimov won the silver medal for Russia in the men&#x27;s road individual time trial, losing to American Tyler Hamilton. Hamilton later admitted to doping and Ekimov, who had raced for many more years than Tyler with the infamous Lance Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel partnership, was promoted to gold.

Ekimov joined the USPS team in 1997 as its first key international signing, briefly retiring in 2001 before rejoining the team the following year. In the 2003 Tour de France Ekimov placed 10th in the prologue. He was a key force in the winning team time trial effort in stage four and was important to Lance Armstrong&#x27;s fifth Tour victory both on the flats and in the mountains. He missed the 2005 Tour de France due to injuries received in a training ride with Armstrong in Texas. During the final stage of the 2006 Tour de France, now racing for the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, he announced that the 2006 Tour would be his last. He was honored by the peloton on the final stage, who allowed him to lead them over the line on the first of the eight laps of the Champs-Élysées. Ekimov started and finished 15 Tours de France, tying him with Lucien Van Impe for the second most Tour finishes, behind Joop Zoetemelk and Sylvain Chavanel.

In September 2006 he finished riding for Discovery, but stayed with the team as Assistant Directeur Sportif to Johan Bruyneel. He helped guide the Discovery riders during the U.S. Pro Cycling Championships in 2006 as well as the Tour of California and the Tour de Georgia.

On 9 September 2009, it was announced he would join as Directeur Sportif.

In October 2012, he was announced as the general manager of the Russian . The UCI, in a letter written to Katusha Team, denied them entrance into the 2013 World Tour. Among the many ethical violations the UCI cited, the appointment of Ekimov was among them for reasons unspecified. After the end of 2016 season Ekimov stepped down from the role.

<text>Matagorda Bay () is a large Gulf of Mexico bay on the Texas coast, lying in Calhoun and Matagorda counties and located approximately northeast of Corpus Christi, east-southeast of San Antonio, south-southwest of Houston, and south-southeast of Austin. It is one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas and serves as the mouth of numerous streams, most notably the Lavaca and Colorado Rivers. The Texas seaport of Port Lavaca is located on the system&#x27;s northwestern extension of Lavaca Bay. The city of Palacios is found on northeastern extension of Tres Palacios Bay, and Port O&#x27;Connor is located on the southwestern tip of the main bay&#x27;s shore. The ghost town of Indianola, which was a major port before it was destroyed by two hurricanes in the late 19th century, is also found on the bay.

The bay is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by Matagorda Peninsula. Its shore, especially near the Colorado River delta, provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The wildlife serves as a basis for the birding and fishing tourism, and is an essential component of the production of seafood, specifically shrimp and blue crab, which are the specialties of the area. The fertile land near the bay is ideal for farming, especially for the propagation of rice.

==History==
Early European records suggest that the bay and the surrounding area went by the names &quot;Espíritu Santo&quot; and &quot;Costa y Bahía de San Bernardo&quot;. Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda&#x27;s map from the late 1510s appears to be the first documentation of the bay. In 1685, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle established the colony of Fort St. Louis along the bay&#x27;s shore after missing the entrance to the Mississippi River. Half of the colonists were killed by disease, and the other half, save for five children, were killed by Karankawa Indians. It was afterward referred to as a &quot;lost colony.&quot; The Indians kept the children until they were rescued by the Spanish during the Alonso De León and Domingo Terán de los Ríos expeditions near the bay. In 1722 Spanish built a fort, Presidio La Bahia, and Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga on the site of Fort Saint Louis.

The port of Linnville was established on Matagorda Bay in 1831, and served as a main port for the Republic of Texas. The Great Comanche Raid of 1840 destroyed the town and forced the inhabitants to flee to the nearby Labbacca, which would later become known as Port Lavaca. Lavaca or &quot;la vaca&quot;, Spanish for cow, was founded in the wake of the Comanche Raid in 1841. It replaced Linnville as the main port on Matagorda Bay. However, the sandbar-heavy Lavaca Bay caused some navigational problems for ships. As a result, Lavaca was surpassed by Indianola as the main port on Matagorda Bay in the 1850s, even though the sandbars were dredged later in the decade. Indianola had been founded in 1846 as a landing place for German immigrants. It rapidly developed into a major seaport, and became the second largest in the state (after Galveston) by the 1860s. The two ports, and strategic control of Matagorda Bay in particular, became important during the American Civil War. Control of the bay shifted between the Union and Confederate forces several times. The Union presence in the area ended in June 1864. After the war, Indianola continued its growth, and had a population of 5,000 in the 1870s. A hurricane in 1875 caused massive damage to the city. It was rebuilt on a smaller scale shortly thereafter, but a second and more intense hurricane made landfall in 1886 (the fifth most intense in U.S. history), causing even greater destruction. The following year, Indianola was completely abandoned. Although Lavaca was also significantly affected by the hurricanes, it survived as a port, and again became the largest on the bay. It continues to hold this distinction today. It was renamed Port Lavaca in the late 19th century. Palacios was established around 1901, and Port O&#x27;Connor was founded on the bay in 1909.

Before 1900, East Matagorda Bay was a free flowing extension, which formed the eastern segment of Matagorda Bay. Flooding and drainage issues caused by the Colorado River, which at the time emptied into the bay, precipitated a massive dredging campaign in the 1920s. Flooding was not remedied by the dredging, as sediment deposited in the bay and formed a tidal marsh that grew at a year. As a result, local citizens decided to change the course of the Colorado River in 1934 to bypass Matagorda Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, the dredging from this project causing the split and forming the isolated East Matagorda Bay. In 1992, the river was diverted back to the bay.

==Features==
The shoreline of the bay is included in the Texas Coastal Plain. At the eastern end, near the Colorado River delta, there is a swampy terrain, with an abundance of wetlands and tidal marshes. Extended coastal prairies supporting native grasses, can be found throughout the area.
On average, the Matagorda Bay system is deep, and covers approximately . The main extensions include: Lavaca Bay, which extends westward to the mouth of the Lavaca River; Tres Palacios Bay, which extends northeast to the mouth of the Tres Palacios River and East Matagorda Bay, which is nearly isolated from the system by the Colorado River delta. Other inlets include Turtle Bay, Carancahua Bay, Keller Bay, and Cox Bay.

Together with its extensions, Matagorda Bay forms one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, and the third largest estuarine system in Texas behind Galveston Bay and Laguna Madre. It receives the discharge from the Colorado River and the Lavaca River, as well as numerous smaller creeks. Every second, approximately of water flows into the bay. Water exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Pass Cavallo, Matagorda Ship Channel, Greens Bayou, the Colorado River Delta Complex and Brown Cedar Cut. As a result of the seawater exchange, the bay&#x27;s salinity is 19 parts per thousand (ppt), which is lower than the seawater average of 35 ppt.

==Ecosystem==
A wide variety of wildlife can be found in and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society&#x27;s annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators.

According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have been caught in the bay: striped bass, gafftopsail catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, barred grunt, hake, skipjack herring, crevalle jack, ladyfish, Gulf menhaden, pigfish, smooth puffer, sand seatrout, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, gray snapper, southern stingray, Gulf toadfish and tripletail. The bay serves as a nursery for finfish, shrimp and crabs.

==Industry==
The Matagorda Bay system is a renowned fishing location in the region, due to its status as a nutrient-rich estuary. The mainstays of the settlements on the bay include seafood processing, manufacturing, agriculture and tourism. Commercial fishermen specialize in oyster, blue crab, and shrimp. Port Lavaca is the national leader in the processing of shrimp, and passed four million tons of seafood through its port in 1985 alone. Palacios houses the largest blue crab processing plant in the United States, and is home to the only individually quick frozen shrimp plant in Texas. Recreational fishing also contributes to the local economies via tourism. Tourists often flock to the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier, which is a major point of interest for fishermen. Other activities for visitors include hunting, oyster roasts, beach combing and birding.

Several manufacturing complexes have been erected along the bay, which employ local residents. The Aluminum Company of America, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics all established plants in Point Comfort. The South Texas Nuclear Generating Station is found in nearby Bay City. Petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the bay in the 1930s. Maize, cotton, soybeans, turf, and rice grow well around the bay, especially in the fertile delta region.

<text>Ioan Slavici (; 18 January 1848 – 17 August 1925) was a Romanian writer and journalist from Austria-Hungary, later Romania.

He made his debut in &quot;Convorbiri literare&quot; (&quot;Literary Conversations&quot;) (1871), with the comedy &quot;Fata de birău&quot; (&quot;The Mayor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;). Alongside Mihai Eminescu he founded the Young Romania Social and Literary Academic Society and organized, in 1871, the Putna Celebration of the Romanian Students from Romania and from abroad. At the end of 1874, he settled in Bucharest, where he became secretary of the Hurmuzachi Collection Committee, then he became a professor, and then an editor of the newspaper &quot;Timpul&quot; (&quot;The Time&quot;). Alongside Ion Luca Caragiale and George Coșbuc, he edited the &quot;Vatra&quot; (&quot;The Hearth&quot;) magazine. During World War I, he collaborated at the newspapers &quot;Ziua&quot; (&quot;The Day&quot;) and &quot;Gazeta Bucureștilor&quot; (&quot;The Bucharest Gazette&quot;). He was awarded the Romanian Academy Award (1903).

==Early life==
Slavici was born in the village of Világos (today Șiria, Romania), near Arad, in 1848 to Sava and Elena Slavici. Slavici studied at the local Orthodox school in Șiria and various other institutions in Transylvania, taught in either Hungarian or German and becomes a member of the Romania Lecture Society.

After finishing his studies, Slavici first enrolles to study law in Budapest in 1868, and in Vienna, in 1869. But shortly after due to financial difficulties he is forced to return to Cumlaus and take a job as a notary public. Throughout his employment, Slavici saved the money that would help him continue his studies in Vienna.

==&quot;Junimea&quot;==
In 1871, he left for Vienna as part of his military service. This proved to be a decisive moment in the life of the future writer, as Slavici had a chance to meet Mihai Eminescu, the most important Romanian poet, who was studying at the University of Vienna. The two became good friends, with Eminescu encouraging and assisting Slavici in the development of his style and of the works themselves. The same year marked Slavici&#x27;s literary debut in &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;, the mouthpiece of the &quot;Junimea&quot; society in Iași.

In 1872, Slavici again had to interrupt his studies because of financial difficulties. Two years later, he left Austria-Hungary and moved to Iași, where he took part in the &quot;Junimea&quot; gatherings. In 1874 the Ioan Slavici Classical Theatre was established in Arad. His first book, &quot;Nuvele din popor&quot;, a collection of short stories, was published in 1881. It included &quot;Moara cu noroc&quot; (&quot;The Lucky Mill&quot;) and &quot;Budulea Taichii&quot;, two of Slavici&#x27;s best-known and crafted works.

==Prisons and return to Romania==
In 1882, he was selected as a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. In 1884, Slavici moved to Transylvania, becoming actively involved in the Romanian national movement, serving as a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian National Party, the main political forum of Romanians in the region. Hungarian authorities sentenced Slavici to one year in prison for his nationalist stance. This was the first of many short stays in prison in Slavici&#x27;s life (not all of them connected with his political attitudes – some were the outcome of lawsuits against other journalists).

Six years later, he moved to Bucharest and, in 1894, he began publishing the first parts of his most famous novel, &quot;Mara&quot;, which was published as a single volume 12 years later. This is also the period of his activities as editor of &quot;Vatra&quot; magazine, alongside George Coșbuc and Ion Luca Caragiale.

==World War I and later years==
In 1909, Slavici began work for the pro-German newspaper &quot;Ziua&quot;. With the outbreak of World War I, his writings at the newspaper brought him into conflict with other intellectuals who supported the Triple Entente powers. On 14 August 1916, Romania entered the War on the Entente side, attacking Hungary in Transylvania. After a successful German and Austro-Hungarian counterattack, Romania had most of its territory (including Bucharest) occupied by the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Bulgarian troops in the summer of 1917.

The Romanian legitimate government took refuge in Iași, with the Central Powers establishing a puppet administration for the occupied lands. Slavici collaborated with the new government, being employed as editor of the official journal, the &quot;Bucharest Gazette&quot;. After the German withdrawal in November 1918, he was put on trial for his wartime activities and spent one year in jail, while his reputation with the intelligentsia was tarnished.

In 1925 Slavici went to stay with his daughter in Panciu (a town now in Vrancea County). He died there later that year, and was buried at the hermitage within .

==Antisemitism==
In contrast to the &quot;Junimea&quot; leadership, Slavici was an outspoken antisemite. His early definition of Jews as &quot;&quot;a disease&quot; was doubled by his arguments in favor of their violent expulsion from Romanian soil:
:&quot;The solution that remains for us is, at a signal, to close the borders, to annihilate them, to throw them into the Danube right up to the very last of them, so that nothing remain of their seed!&quot;&quot;
Later on, Slavici considered that:
:&quot;The hatred that has welled up against these people is natural, and this hatred can easily be unleashed against all of them that have inherited wealth or acquired it themselves, and could lead at the end to a horrible shedding of blood.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Ioan Slavici Classical Theatre in Arad and the Ioan Slavici National College in Satu Mare are named in his honor. Streets in Arad, Baia Mare, Bistrița, Satu Mare, Suceava, and Timișoara also bear his name.

<doc id="914191" wikidata="Q8048786" url="?curid=914191" title="Yankee White">
<text>Yankee White is an administrative nickname for a background check undertaken in the United States of America for Department of Defense personnel and contractor employees working with the president and vice president. Obtaining such clearance requires, in part, a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is conducted under the manuals of the U.S. Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.

Individuals with Yankee White clearance undergo extensive background investigation. The Yankee White clearance includes requirements of U.S. citizenship and unquestionable loyalty to the United States.

==Policy and implementation==
The initial directive detailing the checks required was DoD Directive 5210.55, &quot;Selection of DoD Military and Civilian Personnel and Contractor Employees for Assignment to Presidential Support Activities&quot; issued on July 6, 1977. This was revised on 15 December 1998. DoD Instruction 5210.87 contains detailed information for the implementation of the policy, assignment of responsibilities and prescription of procedures to be followed. The administrative nickname &quot;Yankee White&quot; is referred to in the implementing instruction.

==Clearance categories==
There are three categories of Presidential Support Activities clearance.

* Category one clearance is required for selected personnel serving in extremely sensitive positions in direct support of the president or vice president. This includes:
** White House Military Office (WHMO)
*** Director, Airlift Operations Office
*** Director, Presidential Contingency Programs Office
*** Director, Special Programs Office
*** National Security Advisor
** Military Aides to the President and Vice President
** Director, White House Medical Unit
** Chief, US Army Transportation Agency, White House
** Food Service Coordinator of the White House Staff Mess
** Commander and Deputy Commander, White House Communications Agency
** Presidential Pilot and Deputy Presidential Pilot, 89th Airlift Wing, Andrews AFB
** Commanding Officer and Executive Officer, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1)
** Commanding Officer and Executive Officer, Naval Support Facility Thurmont, MD (Camp David)
** Other personnel as determined by the WHMO director and the deputy assistant to the vice president for national security affairs
* Category two clearance is required for personnel assigned on a permanent or full-time basis to duties in direct support of the president or vice president (including the office staff of the WHMO director and all individuals under his or her control). This includes but is not limited to:
** Presidential aircrew and associated maintenance and security personnel
** White House Communications Agency personnel
** White House Transportation Agency personnel
** White House Staff Mess personnel
** White House Medical Unit personnel
** DoD personnel assigned to the Office of the Vice President
** Personnel assigned to the Naval Support Facility Thurmont, MD, more commonly known as &quot;Camp David&quot;. 
** Employees of contractor firms who provide recurring services or who require unescorted access to Presidential support areas (PSAs), activities, or equipment—including the maintenance of the Presidential retreat or Vice President&#x27;s residence, communications, aircraft, or facilities
** Principals of those firms used for PSAs who have direct involvement in the contract
* Category three clearance is required for personnel assigned to honor guard units, ceremonial units, and military bands who perform at presidential or vice presidential functions and facilities.

<doc id="914192" wikidata="Q1424128" url="?curid=914192" title="Ron Mercer">
<text>Ronald Eugene Mercer (born May 18, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player. After his career at the University of Kentucky, Mercer played for several teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA); he ended his career with the New Jersey Nets in 2005.

==Basketball career==

===Early years===
Ron Mercer was twice named &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot; of Tennessee while at Goodpasture Christian School in Madison, Tennessee. He then transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia, and was rated by Bob Gibbons to be the best prep player of the class of 1995.

===University of Kentucky===
Mercer had a very successful collegiate career, having been an All-American and all-Southeastern Conference player at Kentucky, and part of a national championship team his freshman year.

===NBA===

====Boston Celtics====
Mercer was selected with the sixth overall pick of the 1997 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics and was reunited with fellow Kentucky teammate Antoine Walker, and Rick Pitino, his coach at Kentucky who had just become the coach of the Celtics. Prior to Mercer&#x27;s drafting, Pitino was recorded as saying that he did not envisage Mercer as having the necessary talent to be selected very high. Some felt this was just a ploy to scare the other teams away from him so as to increase the likelihood of Mercer being available by the time the Celtics got an opportunity to make their draft selection. It turned out it was.

====Denver Nuggets and Orlando Magic====
After two seasons in Boston, Mercer was traded by the Celtics along with Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius to the Denver Nuggets for Danny Fortson, Eric Williams, Eric Washington, and a future draft choice. He played 37 games for Denver in 1999–2000, then played the final 31 games that season with the Orlando Magic due to a trade.

====Chicago Bulls====
Mercer left after that season, signing as a free agent with the Chicago Bulls the next year. He averaged 19.7 points per game in his first year with them.

This was Mercer&#x27;s career high in points per game and was the second leading scorer on the team.
====Indiana Pacers====
Despite Mercer&#x27;s 16.8 points per game in 2001–02, he was traded midway through the season alongside Brad Miller, Ron Artest, and Kevin Ollie to the Indiana Pacers for Jalen Rose, Travis Best, Norman Richardson, and a second-round draft pick. In Indiana, he served merely as a reserve player and his play declined rapidly over his one-and-a-half-season stint with the club.

====San Antonio Spurs====
Before the 2003–04 season, Mercer was traded to the San Antonio Spurs in a three-team trade that again involved Brad Miller and the Sacramento Kings&#x27; Hedo Türkoğlu. After playing 39 games with the Spurs, he was released.

====New Jersey Nets====
Prior to the 2004–05 season, Mercer signed with his seventh NBA team, the New Jersey Nets. On August 15, 2005, prior to the 2005–06 NBA season, he was waived by the Nets to avoid the league&#x27;s luxury tax as part of the new labor agreement.

==Sexual assault allegation==
In 1997, Mercer and fellow former Celtic player Chauncey Billups were accused of sexually assaulting a woman at the home of teammate Antoine Walker. According to a civil suit, Billups, Mercer, and Walker&#x27;s roommate Michael Irvin assaulted the woman at Walker&#x27;s condo after leaving a Boston comedy club on November 9, 1997. A medical examination on the following day revealed injuries consistent with the victim&#x27;s testimony. No criminal charges were filed, but Billups and Mercer settled a civil suit in 2000.

<text>Josef Koudelka (born 10 January 1938) is a Czech-French photographer. He is a member of Magnum Photos and has won awards such as the Prix Nadar (1978), a Grand Prix National de la Photographie (1989), a Grand Prix Henri Cartier-Bresson (1991), and the Hasselblad Foundation International Award in Photography (1992). Exhibitions of his work have been held at the Museum of Modern Art and the International Center of Photography, New York; the Hayward Gallery, London; the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; and the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.

==Biography==
Koudelka was born in 1938 in the small Moravian town of Boskovice, Czechoslovakia. He began photographing his family and the surroundings with a 6×6 Bakelite camera. He studied at the Czech Technical University in Prague (ČVUT) in 1956, receiving a degree in engineering in 1961. He staged his first photographic exhibition the same year. Later he worked as an aeronautical engineer in Prague and Bratislava.

Koudelka began taking commissions from theatre magazines, and regularly photographed stage productions at Prague&#x27;s Theatre Behind the Gate on a Rolleiflex camera. In 1967, he decided to give up his career in engineering for full-time work as a photographer.

Between 1962 and 1971, Koudelka travelled throughout Czechoslovakia and rural Romania, Hungary, France and Spain photographing Romani people. The Romani led a nomadic lifestyle and each summer Koudelka would travel for the project, &quot;carrying a rucksack and a sleeping bag, sleeping in the open air, and living frugally&quot;.

He had returned from photographing Romani people in Romania just two days before the Soviet invasion, in August 1968. He witnessed and recorded the military forces of the Warsaw Pact as they invaded Prague and crushed reforms of the so-called Prague Spring. Some of Koudelka&#x27;s negatives were smuggled out of Prague to the Magnum Photos agency, and published anonymously in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Magazine under the initials P. P. (Prague Photographer) for fear of reprisal to him and his family.

Koudelka&#x27;s pictures of the events became dramatic international symbols, and came to be &quot;recognised as one of the most powerful photojournalistic essays of the 20th century&quot;. In 1969 the &quot;anonymous Czech photographer&quot; was awarded the Overseas Press Club&#x27;s Robert Capa Gold Medal for photographs requiring exceptional courage. Many of his photographs of these events were not seen until decades later.

With Magnum to recommend him to the British authorities, Koudelka applied for a three-month working visa and fled to England in 1970, where he applied for political asylum and stayed for more than a decade. In 1971 he joined Magnum as an Associate Member and became a Full Member in 1974. He continued to wander around Europe with his camera and little else.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Koudelka sustained his work through numerous grants and awards, and continued to exhibit and publish major projects like &quot;Gypsies&quot; (1975) and &quot;Exiles&quot; (1988). Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2011, described &quot;Gypsies&quot; as &quot;a classic of documentary photography&quot;. Since 1986, he has worked with a panoramic camera and issued a compilation of these photographs in his book &quot;Chaos&quot; in 1999. Koudelka has had many other books of his work published, including in 2006 the retrospective volume &quot;Koudelka.&quot;

He and his work received support and acknowledgment from his friend the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. He was also supported by the Czech art historian Anna Farova.

In 1987, Koudelka became a French citizen, and was able to return to Czechoslovakia for the first time, in 1990. He then produced &quot;Black Triangle,&quot; documenting the wasted landscape in the Podkrušnohoří region, the western tip of the Black Triangle&#x27;s foothills of the Ore Mountains, located between Germany and the Czech Republic.

Koudelka lives in France and Prague and is continuing his work documenting the European landscape. He is the father of two daughters, one being Lucina Hartley Koudelka, and a son, Nicola Koudelka.

==Work==
Koudelka&#x27;s early work significantly shaped his later photography, and its emphasis on social and cultural rituals as well as death. He soon moved on to a more personal, in depth photographic study of the Gypsies of Slovakia, and later Romania. This work was exhibited in Prague in 1967. Throughout his career, Koudelka has been praised for his ability to capture the presence of the human spirit amidst dark landscapes. Desolation, waste, departure, despair and alienation are common themes in his work. His characters sometimes seem to come out of fairytales. Still, some see hope within his work – the endurance of human endeavor, in spite of its fragility. His later work focuses on the landscape removed of human subjects.

His most recent book, &quot;Wall: Israeli and Palestinian Landscapes,&quot; was published by Aperture Foundation in 2013. This book is composed of panoramic landscapes that he made between 2008 and 2012, as his project for the photography collective This Place, organized by photographer Frédéric Brenner. A documentary about Koudelka&#x27;s work there, &quot;Koudelka Shooting Holy Land,&quot; was released in 2015.
