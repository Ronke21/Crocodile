<text>Operation Petticoat is a 1959 American World War II submarine comedy film in Eastmancolor from Universal-International, produced by Robert Arthur, directed by Blake Edwards, and starring Cary Grant and Tony Curtis.

The film tells in flashback the misadventures of a fictional U.S. Navy submarine, USS &quot;Sea Tiger&quot;, during the Battle of the Philippines in the opening days of the United States involvement in World War II. Some elements of the screenplay were taken from actual incidents that happened with some of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s submarines during the war. Members of the cast include several actors who went on to become television stars in the 1960s and 1970s: Gavin MacLeod of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, Marion Ross of &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and Dick Sargent of &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

Paul King, Joseph Stone, Stanley Shapiro, and Maurice Richlin were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing for their work on &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;. The film was the basis for a TV series in 1977 starring John Astin in Grant&#x27;s role.

==Plot==
In 1959, U. S. Navy Rear Admiral Matt Sherman, ComSubPac, boards the obsolete diesel submarine USS &quot;Sea Tiger&quot;, prior to her departure for the scrapyard. Sherman, her first commanding officer, begins reading his wartime personal logbook, and a flashback begins.

On December 10, 1941, a Japanese air raid sinks &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; while she is docked at the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines. Lieutenant Commander Sherman and his crew begin repairs, hoping to sail for Darwin, Australia, before the Japanese overrun the port. Believing there is no chance of repairing the submarine, the squadron commodore transfers most of Sherman&#x27;s crew to other boats, but promises Sherman that he will have first call on any available replacements. Lieutenant (junior grade) Nick Holden, an admiral&#x27;s aide, is reassigned to &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; despite a total lack of submarine training or experience.

Holden demonstrates great skill as a scrounger and fixer after Sherman makes him the supply officer. He teams up with Marine Sergeant Ramon Gallardo, an escaped prisoner (caught misappropriating Navy property to run his own restaurant), to obtain materials desperately needed for repairs. What Holden and his men cannot acquire from base warehouses, they steal.

Restored to barely seaworthy condition, &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; puts to sea after a native witch doctor casts a protection spell on her. &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; reaches Marinduque, where Sherman reluctantly agrees to evacuate five stranded Army nurses. Holden is attracted to Second Lieutenant Barbara Duran, while Sherman has a series of embarrassing encounters with the well-endowed and clumsy Second Lieutenant Dolores Crandall. Later, when Sherman prepares to attack an enemy oiler moored to a pier, Crandall accidentally fires a torpedo prematurely. It misses the tanker and instead &quot;sinks&quot; a truck ashore.
Sherman tries to put the nurses ashore at Cebu, but an Army officer tells him the Japanese are closing in. Unable to obtain needed supplies from official sources, Sherman allows Holden to set up a casino to acquire them from the troops. Chief Torpedoman Molumphry, the Chief of the Boat, has been asking for paint. Holden manages to get some red and white lead primer paint, but does not have enough of either for the entire hull. Sherman reluctantly has the two mixed together, resulting in a pale pink primer that is applied. A Japanese air raid forces a hasty departure before the crew can apply a top coat of navy gray.

Tokyo Rose mocks the mysterious pink submarine, while the U.S. Navy believes it to be a Japanese deception and orders that it be sunk on sight. An American destroyer spots &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; and opens fire, then launches depth charges when the submarine crash dives. Sherman tries an oil slick and then launches blankets, pillows, and life jackets from his one working torpedo tube, but the deception fails. At Holden&#x27;s suggestion, Sherman ejects the nurses&#x27; lingerie. Crandall&#x27;s bra convinces the destroyer&#x27;s captain that &quot;the Japanese have nothing like this&quot;, and he ceases fire. &quot;Sea Tiger&quot;, still painted pink, arrives at Darwin, battered and listing, but under her own power.

Sherman&#x27;s reminiscence ends with the arrival of Commander Nick Holden, his wife (the former Lieutenant Duran), and their two sons. Sherman promises Holden command of a new nuclear-powered submarine, also named &quot;Sea Tiger&quot;. Sherman&#x27;s wife (the former Lieutenant Crandall) arrives late with their four daughters and rear-ends her husband&#x27;s staff car, causing it to lock bumpers with a Navy bus. When the bus drives away, dragging his car with it, Sherman reassures his wife that it will be stopped at the main gate. Commander Holden then takes &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; out on her final voyage.

==Production==
Curtis took credit for the inception of &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;. He had joined the U.S. Navy during World War II intending to enter the submarine service in part because his hero, Cary Grant, had appeared in &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; (1943). After he became a star, Curtis suggested making a film in which Grant would stare into a periscope as he did in &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot;. Curtis very much enjoyed working with Grant.

Former Universal-International contract actor Jeff Chandler was originally set to have played Matt Sherman, but pulled out to film &quot;The Jayhawkers&quot; (1959) instead. Tina Louise turned down the role of one of the nurses as she felt the film had too many sex jokes.

&quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; was produced with extensive support of the Department of Defense and the US Navy. Most of the filming was done in and around Naval Station Key West, now the Truman Annex of Naval Air Station Key West, Florida, which substituted for the Philippines and Australia. Filming for the period suggesting postwar 1959 was done at Naval Station San Diego, California.

USS &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; was portrayed by three different American World War II s:
* , in the opening and closing scenes (the &quot;393&quot; on the conning tower being visible)
* , for all the scenes where the boat was painted the standard gray and black
* , for all the scenes in which &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; was painted pink

The attacking destroyer and, during the arrival at Darwin, the destroyer visible in the background is the .

==Historical accuracy==
A plot error says that &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; is heading to Darwin to meet up with the sub tender in December 1941; &quot;Bushnell&quot; was not commissioned until 1943.

As noted above, the fictional &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; is played by three different &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines. The action of the film begins on December 10, 1941, with &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; obviously already in-service; however, the first &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine would not be launched until late October 1942. (Based on her name, &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; probably would have been a prewar .)

Some of the plot points of &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; were based on real-life incidents, such as:
* The evacuation of one Navy nurse and several Army nurses from Corregidor to Australia by the submarine , commanded by future Navy Cross recipient James C. Dempsey;
* The evacuation of Filipino civilians to Australia may have been inspired by USS &quot;Narwhal&#x27;s&quot; evacuation of 32 civilians from Mindanao, including eight women, two children, and an infant during her seventh war patrol on November 15, 1943.
* The sinking of the submarine at the pier at Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines;
* The torpedoing of a bus by ; 
* Captain Sherman&#x27;s letter to the supply department at Cavite on the inexplicable lack of toilet paper (based on an actual letter to the supply department of Mare Island Naval Shipyard by Lieutenant Commander James Wiggins &quot;Red&quot; Coe of the submarine );
* The need to paint a submarine pink because of a lack of enough red or white lead undercoat: Heat from the burning USS &quot;Sealion&quot; also scorched off the black paint on the nearby ; for a time, the submarine fought with only her red lead undercoat visible. This led Tokyo Rose to disparage American &quot;red pirate submarines&quot;.
* Another possible source for the &quot;pink&quot; submarine is the decorated , commanded by Samuel David Dealey. Under the belief that a pinkish tint would help with camouflage, especially near dawn and dusk, Dealey added pink to the light grey that was standard for the Navy&#x27;s Measure 32 paint scheme.

==Reception==
&quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; was a hit with audiences and critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 6.60/10.

The review in &quot;Variety&quot; was typical: &quot;Operation Petticoat has no more weight than a sackful of feathers, but it has a lot of laughs. Cary Grant and Tony Curtis are excellent, and the film is directed by Blake Edwards with a slam-bang pace&quot;.
A much more restrained commentary came from Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who noted in his December 8, 1959 review that the plot device of women aboard a wartime submarine was strained. &quot;And that is the obvious complication upon which are pointedly based at least 60 per cent of the witticisms and sight gags in the film. How to berth the nurses in the exceedingly limited space, how to explain to them the functioning of the bathroom facilities, how to compel the sailors to keep their well-diverted minds on their work — these are the endless petty problems that vex Commander Grant&quot;.

===Box office performance===
&quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; was a huge box office hit, earning over $9.3 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada, which made it the third highest-grossing film of 1959, the highest-domestic-grossing comedy of all-time up to that point, as well as the most financially successful film of Cary Grant&#x27;s career. Through his contract, Grant&#x27;s residuals topped $3 million, making &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; his most profitable film to date.

== 1977 television series ==
&quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; was adapted as an ABC-TV series which ran from September 17, 1977, to August 10, 1979. Initially starring John Astin in Grant&#x27;s role of Lieutenant Commander Sherman, the TV series cast Tony Curtis&#x27; daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, as Lieutenant Duran. Most of the cast was replaced for the show&#x27;s second season, a decision that led to low ratings and cancellation. Only 32 episodes of the series (22 in season 1, 10 in season 2) were produced in total.

<text>Manaton is a village and civil parish in Teignbridge District, situated to the southeast of Dartmoor National Park, Devon, England.

The 15th-century church, located in a prominent spot due north of the village green, is dedicated to St Winifred. Three of the six bells in its tower are medieval – markings on the oldest indicate that it was made by London bellmaker Johanna Hill around 1440–1450, making them at least as ancient as the tower. They are still being rung today on a regular basis by the local team of bellringers. Its rood screen was carved in around 1500, but as is the case with many old English Churches, the figures, both painted and carved in wood, were defaced during the Reformation. Much of the original screen does still exist however, its wood carving having been first restored by the Pinwill sisters in the late nineteenth century and again in 1981 by the late Anna Hulbert. 

A granite cross once stood in the churchyard, but was destroyed in the mid-19th century by the vicar, Rev. John Charles Carwithen. He did so because he disapproved of what he considered to be a superstitious custom of carrying coffins three times around the cross before burial.

In 1890 and 1892, extensive restoration work was carried out by the prolific church architect George Fellowes Prynne. Prynne&#x27;s brother, Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne, a notable late Pre-Raphaelite artist and designer, created the painted panels in the reredos behind the altar. 

Between 1903 and 1923, the writer John Galsworthy and his wife Ada Galsworthy frequently stayed in a farmhouse called Wingstone in the village. It was here that he was inspired by the nearby Jay&#x27;s Grave and its legend to write his short story &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; in 1916.

Manaton was known as the `ton in local dialect.

<doc id="934819" wikidata="Q420146" url="?curid=934819" title="Lithium nitrate">
<text>Lithium nitrate is an inorganic compound with the formula LiNO3. It is the lithium salt of nitric acid (an alkali metal nitrate). The salt is deliquescent, absorbing water to form the hydrated form, lithium nitrate trihydrate. Its eutectics are of interest for heat transfer fluids.

It is made by treating lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide with nitric acid.

==Uses==
This deliquescent colourless salt is an oxidizing agent used in the manufacture of red-colored fireworks and flares.

===Thermal storage===
The hydrated form, lithium nitrate trihydrate, has an extremely high specific heat of fusion, , and hence can be used for thermal energy storage at its melt temperature of 303.3 K.

Lithium nitrate has been proposed as a medium to store heat collected from the sun for cooking. A Fresnel lens would be used to melt solid lithium nitrate, which would then function as a &quot;solar battery&quot;, allowing heat to be redistributed later by convection.

==Synthesis==
Lithium nitrate can be synthesized by reacting nitric acid and lithium carbonate.
:Li2CO3 + 2 HNO3 → 2 LiNO3 + H2O + CO2

Generally when forming LiNO3, a pH indicator is used to determine when all of the acid has been neutralized. However, this neutralization can also be recognized with the loss of carbon dioxide production. In order to rid the final product of excess water, the sample is heated.

==Toxicity==
Lithium nitrate can be toxic to the body when ingested by targeting the central nervous system, thyroids, kidneys, and cardio-vascular system. 
When exposed to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, lithium nitrate can cause irritation to these areas.

<text>The Federal Intelligence Service (, ; BND) is the foreign intelligence agency of Germany, directly subordinate to the Chancellor&#x27;s Office. The BND headquarters is located in central Berlin. The BND has 300 locations in Germany and foreign countries. In 2016, it employed around 6,500 people; 10% of them are military personnel who are formally employed by the Office for Military Sciences. The BND is the largest agency of the German Intelligence Community.

The BND was founded during the Cold War in 1956 as the official foreign intelligence agency of West Germany, which had recently joined NATO, and in close cooperation with the CIA. It was the successor to the earlier Gehlen Organization, often known simply as &quot;The Organization&quot; or &quot;The Org&quot;, a West German intelligence organization affiliated with the CIA whose existence had not been officially acknowledged. The most central figure in the BND&#x27;s history was general Reinhard Gehlen, the leader of the Gehlen Organization and later the founding president of the BND, who was regarded as &quot;one of the most legendary Cold War spymasters.&quot; From the early days of the Cold War the Gehlen Organization and later the BND had an intimate cooperation with the CIA, and often was the western intelligence community&#x27;s only eyes and ears on the ground in the Eastern Bloc. The BND is also regarded as one of the best informed intelligence services in regards to the Middle East from the 1960s. The BND was quickly established as the western world&#x27;s second largest intelligence agency, second only to the CIA. Both Russia and the Middle East remain important focuses of the BND&#x27;s activities, in addition to violent non-state actors.

The BND today acts as an early warning system to alert the German government to threats to German interests from abroad. It depends heavily on wiretapping and electronic surveillance of international communications. It collects and evaluates information on a variety of areas such as international non-state terrorism, weapons of mass destruction proliferation and illegal transfer of technology, organized crime, weapons and drug trafficking, money laundering, illegal migration and information warfare. As Germany&#x27;s only overseas intelligence service, the BND gathers both military and civil intelligence. While the (KSA) of the also fulfills this mission, it is not an intelligence service. There is close cooperation between the BND and the KSA.

The domestic secret service counterparts of the BND are the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (&#x27;, or BfV) and 16 counterparts at the state level&#x27; (State Offices for the Protection of the Constitution); there is also a separate military intelligence organisation, the Military Counterintelligence Service (&quot;, or MAD).

== History ==

The predecessor of the BND was the German eastern military intelligence agency during World War II, the &quot; or FHO Section in the General Staff, led by Major General Reinhard Gehlen. Its main purpose was to collect information on the Red Army. After the war Gehlen worked with the U.S. occupation forces in West Germany.

In 1946 he set up an intelligence agency informally known as the Gehlen Organization or simply &quot;The Org&quot; He recruited some of his former co-workers at Gestapo Trier: Dietmar Lermen, Heinrich Hädderich, August Hill, Friedrich Walz, Albert Schmidt, and Friedrich Heinrich Busch. Many had been operatives of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris&#x27; wartime (counter-intelligence) organization, but Gehlen also recruited people from the former &quot;&quot; (SD), SS and Gestapo, after their release by the Allies. The latter recruits were controversial because the SS and its associated groups were notoriously the perpetrators of many Nazi atrocities during the war. 
The organization worked at first almost exclusively for the CIA, which contributed funding, equipment, cars, gasoline and other materials.

On 1 April 1956 the &quot;Bundesnachrichtendienst&quot; was created from the Gehlen Organization, and was transferred to the West German government, with all staff. Reinhard Gehlen became President of the BND and remained its head until 1968.

=== Criticism ===
Several publications have criticized Gehlen and his organizations for hiring ex-Nazis. An article in &quot;The Independent&quot; on 29 June 2018 made this statement about some of the BND employees: &quot;Operating until 1956, when it was superseded by the BND, the Gehlen Organisation was allowed to employ at least 100 former Gestapo or SS officers. ... Among them were Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s deputy Alois Brunner, who would go on to die of old age despite having sent more than 100,000 Jews to ghettos or internment camps, and ex-SS major Emil Augsburg. ... Many ex-Nazi functionaries including Silberbauer, the captor of Anne Frank, transferred over from the Gehlen Organisation to the BND. ... Instead of expelling them, the BND even seems to have been willing to recruit more of them – at least for a few years&quot;.

The authors of the book &quot;A Nazi Past: Recasting German Identity in Postwar Europe&quot; state that Reinhard Gehlen simply did not want to know the backgrounds of the men that the BND hired in the 1950s. The American National Security Archive states that &quot;he employed numerous former Nazis and known war criminals&quot;.

On the other hand, Gehlen himself was cleared by James H. Critchfield of the Central Intelligence Agency who worked with the Gehlen Organization from 1949 to 1956. In 2001, he said that &quot;almost everything negative that has been written about Gehlen, [as an] ardent ex-Nazi, one of Hitler&#x27;s war criminals ... is all far from the fact,&quot; as quoted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Critchfield added that Gehlen hired former Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service of the Reichsführer-SS) men &quot;reluctantly, under pressure from German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to deal with &#x27;the avalanche of subversion hitting them from East Germany.&#x27;&quot;

From 2011 to 2018, an independent commission of historians studied the history of the BND in the era of Reinhard Gehlen. The results are published in comprehensive studies. So far (as of April 2020) eleven volumes have been published.

== Operations ==

=== 1960s ===
During the first years of oversight by the State Secretary in the federal chancellery of Konrad Adenauer of the operation in Pullach, Munich District, Bavaria, the BND continued the ways of its forebear, the Gehlen Organization.

The BND racked up its initial east–west cold war successes by concentrating on East Germany. The BND&#x27;s reach encompassed the highest political and military levels of the GDR regime. They knew the carrying capacity of every bridge, the bed count of every hospital, the length of every airfield, the width and level of maintenance of the roads that Soviet armor and infantry divisions would have to traverse in a potential attack on the West. Almost every sphere of eastern life was known to the BND.

Unsung analysts at Pullach, with their contacts in the East, figuratively functioned as flies on the wall in ministries and military conferences. When the Soviet KGB suspected an East German army intelligence officer, a lieutenant colonel and BND agent, of spying, the Soviets investigated and shadowed him. The BND was positioned and able to inject forged reports implying that the loose spy was actually the KGB investigator, who was then arrested by the Soviets and shipped off to Moscow. Not knowing how long the caper would stay under wraps, the real spy was told to be ready for recall; he made his move to the West at the appropriate time.

The East German regime, however, fought back. With still unhindered flight to the west a possibility, infiltration started on a grand scale and a reversal of sorts took hold. During the early 1960s as many as 90% of the BND&#x27;s lower-level informants in East Germany worked as double agents for the East German security service, later known as Stasi. Several informants in East Berlin reported in June and July 1961 of street closures, clearing of fields, accumulation of building materials and police and army deployments in specific parts of the eastern sector, as well as other measures that BND determined could lead to a division of the city. However, the agency was reluctant to report communist initiatives and had no knowledge of the scope and timing because of conflicting inputs. The erection of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 thus came as a surprise, and the BND&#x27;s performance in the political field was thereafter often wrong and remained spotty and unimpressive.

There was a great success for the Federal Intelligence Service during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1962, the BND was the first Western intelligence service to have information about the stationing of Soviet medium-range missiles on the caribbean island and passed it on to the United States. Between 1959 and 1961, Reinhard Gehlen called on Washington several times in vain to &quot;insert the dangerous communist bastion, which at the same time represents an excellent starting point for the communist infiltration of Latin America, into the [USA] sphere of power by rapid access.&quot; Gehlen&#x27;s influence on the US government should not be underestimated, because the BND was able to regularly provide the CIA with detailed information about Soviet arms deliveries through its very good sources in Cuba. There are indications that the secret service was also informed about military actions against Cuba. Ten days before the Bay of Pigs invasion, Gehlen reported to Bonn: &quot;Within a relatively short period of time, large-scale military operations to defeat Fidel Castro will begin.&quot; In 1962, the BND also found out from its sources, the Cuban exiles living in Miami, that Cuba was also trying to get hold of weapons through German dealers. According to a BND report, Cuba was also able to recruit four former Waffen-SS officers as instructors for the Cuban armed forces. However, the identity of the men was blacked out in the report.

&quot;This negative view of BND was certainly not justified during ... [1967 and] 1968.&quot; The BND&#x27;s military work &quot;had been outstanding&quot;, and in certain sectors of the intelligence field the BND still showed brilliance: in Latin America and in the Middle East it was regarded as the best-informed secret service.

The BND offered a fair and reliable amount of intelligence on Soviet and Soviet-bloc forces in Eastern Europe, regarding the elaboration of a NATO warning system against any Soviet operations against NATO territory, in close cooperation with the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces).

One high point of BND intelligence work culminated in its early June 1967 forecast – almost to the hour – of the outbreak of the Six-Day War in the Middle East on 5 June 1967.

According to declassified transcripts of a United States National Security Council meeting on 2 June 1967, CIA Director Richard Helms interrupted Secretary of State Dean Rusk with &quot;reliable information&quot; – contrary to Rusk&#x27;s presentation – that the Israelis would attack on a certain day and time. Rusk shot back: &quot;That is quite out of the question. Our ambassador in Tel Aviv assured me only yesterday that everything was normal.&quot; Helms replied: &quot;I am sorry, but I adhere to my opinion. The Israelis will strike and their object will be to end the war in their favor with extreme rapidity.&quot; President Lyndon Johnson then asked Helms for the source of his information. Helms said: &quot;Mr. President, I have it from an allied secret service. The report is absolutely reliable.&quot; Helms&#x27; information came from the BND.

A further laudable success involved the BND&#x27;s activity during the Czech crisis in 1968; by then, the agency was led by the second president, Gerhard Wessel. With Pullach cryptography fully functioning, the BND predicted an invasion of Soviet and other Warsaw Pact troops into Czechoslovakia. CIA analysts on the other hand did not support the notion of &quot;fraternal assistance&quot; by the satellite states of Moscow; and US ambassador to the Soviet Union, Llewellyn Thompson, quite irritated, called the secret BND report he was given &quot;a German fabrication&quot;. At 23:11 on 20 August 1968, BND radar operators first observed abnormal activity over Czech airspace. An agent on the ground in Prague called a BND out-station in Bavaria: &quot;The Russians are coming.&quot; Warsaw Pact forces had moved as forecast.

However, the slowly sinking efficiency of BND in the last years of Reinhard Gehlen became evident. By 1961, it was clear that the BND employed some men who were Soviet &quot;moles&quot;; they had come from the earlier Gehlen Organization. One mole, Heinz Felfe, was convicted of treason in 1963. Others were not uncovered during Gehlen&#x27;s term in office.

Gehlen&#x27;s refusal to correct reports with questionable content strained the organization&#x27;s credibility, and dazzling achievements became an infrequent commodity. A veteran agent remarked at the time that the BND pond then contained some sardines, though a few years earlier the pond had been alive with sharks.

The fact that the BND could score certain successes despite East German communist Stasi interference, internal malpractice, inefficiencies and infighting, was primarily due to select members of the staff who took it upon themselves to step up and overcome then existing maladies. Abdication of responsibility by Reinhard Gehlen was the malignancy; cronyism remained pervasive, even nepotism (at one time Gehlen had 16 members of his extended family on the BND payroll). Only slowly did the younger generation then advance to substitute new ideas for some of the bad habits caused mainly by Gehlen&#x27;s semi-retired attitude and frequent holiday absences.

Gehlen was forced out in April 1968 due to &quot;political scandal within the ranks&quot;, according to one source. His successor, Bundeswehr Brigadier General Gerhard Wessel, immediately called for a program of modernization and streamlining. With political changes in the West German government and a reflection that BND was at a low level of efficiency, the service began to rebuild. Years later, Wessel&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, reported that he &quot;is credited with modernizing the BND by hiring academic analysts and electronics specialists&quot;.

Reinhard Gehlen&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;The Service, The Memoirs of General Reinhard Gehlen&quot; (English title), were published in 1977, (World Publishers, New York). A Review of the book published by the CIA makes this comment about Gehlen&#x27;s achievements and management style: &quot;Gehlen&#x27;s descriptions of most of his so-called successes in the political intelligence field are, in my opinion, either wishful thinking or self-delusion. ... Gehlen was never a good clandestine operator, nor was he a particularly good administrator. And therein lay his failures. The Gehlen Organization/BND always had a good record in the collection of military and economic intelligence on East Germany and the Soviet forces there. But this information, for the most part, came from observation and not from clandestine penetration&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
The agency&#x27;s second president, Gerhard Wessel, retired in 1978. According to his obituary in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in August 2002, the &quot;former intelligence officer in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s anti-Soviet spy operations&quot; ... &quot;is credited with modernizing the BND by hiring academic analysts and electronics specialists&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; News Service obituary lauded the BND&#x27;s many successes under Wessel but noted that there had been &quot;a number of incidents of East Germans infiltrating the West German government, particularly intelligence agencies, on Gen. Wessel&#x27;s watch&quot;.

==== Munich Olympic bombings ====
The kidnapping and murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich was a watershed event for the BND, following early warnings from other countries, because it led the agency to build counter-terrorism capabilities.

==== Acquisition of Crypto AG ====
In 1970 the CIA and the BND bought the Swiss informations and communication security firm Crypto AG, for $5.75 million. Already in 1967 the BND tried, together with the French intelligence service, to buy the company from its founder Robert Hagelin. This deal though fell through due to Hagelin, who was already cooperating with the CIA, refusing. The CIA at the time did not cooperate with the French. In 1969, after negotiations with the US, the BND approached Hagelin anew and bought the company together with the US intelligence service. Crypto AG produced and sold radio, Ethernet, STM, GSM, phone and fax encryption systems worldwide. Its clients included Iran, Libya, military juntas in Latin America, nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, and even the Vatican. The BND and the CIA rigged the company&#x27;s devices so they could easily decipher the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages.

=== 1980s ===

==== Libyan bombings in Germany ====
In 1986, the BND deciphered the report of the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin regarding the &quot;successful&quot; implementation of the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing.

==== Infiltration into Stasi HQ ====
According to an interview with Stasi defector Col. Rainer Wiegand, BND agents were assigned to use the anti-Stasi protests in East Germany in order to covertly obtain files from Building No. 2, which houses the counterespionage directorate. Wiegand assisted by providing the blueprints of the building and indicated which offices the agents should prioritize.

====Operation Summer Rain====
Operation Summer Rain was a highly classified joint mission involving the 
Federal Intelligence Service and special units of the German Armed Forces during the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s. The primary objective of the operation was to gather intelligence on the weapons systems utilized by Soviet forces.

=== 1990s ===

==== Spying on journalists ====
In 2005, a public scandal erupted (dubbed the &quot;Journalistenskandal&quot;, journalists scandal) over revelations that the BND had placed a number of German journalists under surveillance since the-mid 1990s, in an attempt to discover the source of information leaks from the BND regarding the activities of the service in connection with the war in Iraq and the &quot;war against terror&quot;. The Bundestag constituted an investigative committee (&quot;Parlamentarischer Untersuchungsausschuss&quot;) to investigate the allegations. The committee tasked the former Federal Appellate Court (Bundesgerichtshof) judge Dr. as special investigator, who published a report confirming illegal BND operations involving and targeting journalists between 1993 and 2005. As a consequence, the Chancellery issued an executive order banning BND operational measures against journalists with the aim to protect the service.

The committee published a final report in 2009, which mostly confirmed the allegations, identifying the intent to protect the BND from disclosure of classified information and finding a lack of oversight within the senior leadership of the service but did not identify any responsible members from within the government.

==== Tiitinen list ====
In 1990, BND gave the Finnish Security Intelligence Service the so-called Tiitinen list—which supposedly contains names of Finns who were believed to have links to Stasi. The list was classified and locked in a safe after the Director of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service, Seppo Tiitinen, and the President of Finland, Mauno Koivisto, determined that it was based on vague hints instead of hard evidence.

==== Unlicensed armament exports ====
In the wake of the German reunification in 1991, Israel requested access to GDR weapon systems. In March 1991 a parliamentary commission decided to not give the requested weapons to Israel. Six month later, under the supervision of BND-director Volker Foertsch, the service, in conjunction with elements within the Federal Ministry of Defence, still without political clearance to do so, arranged several transfers of the requested GDR weapon systems (an SA-6 system, a ZSU-23/4 and other equipment) to Israel. The transfers were shipped using the ports and airports of Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, Manching and Alhorn. In late 1991, a shipment labeled &quot;agricultural machinery&quot; was unexpectedly inspected by the Wasserschutzpolizei and weapons were discovered. A state’s attorney started an investigation and parliamentary designated BND-overseer Willy Wimmer concluded, that control over the BND has been lost. An exasperated Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the service &quot;idiots&quot;. A few weeks later BND president Konrad Porzner and minister of defence Gerhard Stoltenberg rated the transfers as not to be problematic, since the equipment was only handed over for trials and was supposed to be returned afterwards.

=== 2000s ===
==== Promoting the invasion of Iraq ====
On 5 February 2003, Colin Powell made the case for a military attack on Iraq in front of the UN Security Council. Powell supported his case with information received from the BND, instead of Mr. Hans Blix and the IAEA. The BND had collected intelligence from an informant known as Rafid al-Janabi alias CURVEBALL, who claimed Iraq would be in possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction, apart from torturing and killing over 1,000 dissidents each year, for over 20 years. Rafid was employed before and after the 2003 incident which ultimately led to the invasion of Iraq. The payments of 3,000 Euros monthly were made by a cover firm called Thiele und Friedrichs (Munich). 
As a result of the premature cancellation, al-Janabi filed a lawsuit at the Munich labour court and won the case.

Several former senior BND officials publicly stated that the agency had repeatedly warned the CIA not to take Curveball&#x27;s information as fact. Hanning, the BND president at the time, even formulated his concerns about that in a letter to then CIA Director George Tenet. The CIA however ignored those warnings and presented the information as facts.

==== Israel vs. Lebanon ====
Following the 2006 Lebanon War, the BND mediated secret negotiations between Israel and Hezbollah, eventually leading up to the 2008 Israel–Hezbollah prisoner exchange.

==== Fighting tax evasion ====

In the beginning of 2008, it was revealed that the BND had managed to recruit excellent sources within Liechtenstein banks and had been conducting espionage operations in the principality since the beginning of the 2000s. The BND mediated the German Finance Ministry&#x27;s $7.3 million acquisition of a CD from a former employee of the LGT Group – a Liechtenstein bank owned by the country&#x27;s ruling family. While the Finance Ministry defends the deal, saying it would result in several hundred millions of dollars in back tax payments, the sale remains controversial, as a government agency has paid for possibly stolen data.

==== Kosovo ====
In November 2008, three German BND agents were arrested in Kosovo for allegedly throwing a bomb at the European Union International Civilian Office, which oversees Kosovo&#x27;s governance. Later the &quot;Army of the Republic of Kosovo&quot; had accepted responsibility for the bomb attack. Laboratory tests had shown no evidence of the BND agents&#x27; involvement. However, the Germans were released only 10 days after they were arrested. It was suspected that the arrest was a revenge by Kosovo authorities for the BND report about organized crime in Kosovo which accuses Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi, as well as the former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj of far-reaching involvement in organized crime.

==== Austria ====
According to reporting in &quot;Der Standard&quot; and &quot;profil&quot;, the BND engaged in espionage in Austria between 1999 and 2006, spying on targets including the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Austria Press Agency, embassies, and Austrian banks and government ministries. The government of Austria has called on Germany to clarify the allegations.

=== 2010s ===

In 2014, an employee of BND was arrested for handing over secret documents to the United States. He was suspected of handing over documents about the committee investigating the NSA spying in Germany. The German government responded to this espionage by expelling the top CIA official in Berlin. In December 2016, WikiLeaks published 2,420 documents from the BND and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). The published materials had been submitted in 2015 as part of a German parliamentary inquiry into the surveillance activities of the BND and its cooperation with the US National Security Agency. The BND has been reported to store 220 million sets of metadata every day. That is, they record with whom, when, where and for how long someone communicates. This data is supposedly collected across the world, but the exact locations remains unclear to this date. The Bundestag committee investigating the NSA spying scandal has uncovered that the German intelligence agency intercepts communications traveling via both satellites and Internet cables. It seems certain that the metadata only come from &quot;foreign dialed traffic&quot;, that is, from telephone conversations and text messages that are held and sent via mobile phones and satellites. Of these 220 million data amassed every day, one percent is archived for 10 years &quot;for long-term analysis&quot;. Apparently though, this long-term storage doesn&#x27;t hold any Internet communications, data from social networks, or emails.

In December 2022, a high-ranking employee of the BND was arrested on alleged treason. Carsten L. is said to have disclosed information from his professional activity to the Russian domestic secret service FSB. The Public Prosecutor General accuses him of treason (&quot;Landesverrat&quot;) because it is said to have been state secrets.

== New headquarters ==
The new BND headquarters in Berlin, near the former Berlin Wall, was completed in 2017. At the official opening in February 2019, Angela Merkel, then Chancellor of Germany, made this statement: &quot;In an often very confusing world, now, more urgently than ever, Germany needs a strong and efficient foreign intelligence service&quot;. At the time, some 4,000 employees were expected to work from this location, moving here from the former headquarters in Pullach, a suburb of Munich. The agency&#x27;s total number of employees, in Germany and other countries, was approximately 6,500.

== Structure ==
The Bundesnachrichtendienst is divided into the following departments:

# &quot;Regionale Auswertung und Beschaffung A (LA) und Regionale Auswertung und Beschaffung B (LB)&quot; (Regional Analysis and Procurement, A/B countries)
# &quot;Internationaler Terrorismus und Internationale Organisierte Kriminalität (TE)&quot; (Terrorism and International Organised Crime)
# &quot;Proliferation, ABC-Waffen, Wehrtechnik (TW)&quot; (Proliferation, NBC Weapons)
# &quot;Technische Aufklärung (TA)&quot; (Signal Intelligence)
# &quot;Gesamtlage und unterstützende Fachdienste (GU)&quot; (Situation Centre)

# &quot;Informationstechnik (IT)&quot; (Information Technology)
# &quot;Zentralabteilung (ZY)&quot; (Central Services)
# &quot;Eigensicherung (SI)&quot; (Security)
# &quot;Umzug (UM)&quot; (Relocation [to Berlin])

== Signals intelligence ==
BND is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes with content of German interest. The department &quot;Technische Aufklärung&quot; (&quot;TA&quot;) is the most significant unit within BND and has the highest number of employees. The department is located at the former BND HQ in Pullach, Bavaria. One of the major SIGINT stations after WW2 was Bad Aibling Station, which was operated for decades in cooperation with the National Security Agency (NSA). Furthermore, Station Gablingen, Station Husum, Station Rheinhausen, Station Schöningen, Station Starnberg-Söcking and Station Stockdorf.

BND is not operating own satellites but using reconnaissance satellites of Bundeswehr (SARAH-system), of foreign partners or commercial providers. The first own BND-satellite project started in 2016. The systems are built by OHB and should have been in service since 2022. After research by German public media the start was delayed and BND will probably not be able to launch satellites into space until 2025.

=== Internet interception ===
BND is intercepting the data traffic of DE-CIX in Frankfurt, European largest hub for internet traffic.

Details are available today on how the BND and NSA worked together between 2004 and 2008. In Frankfurt, Internet data was captured by filters and sent via a Deutsche Telekom line to the BND headquarters in Pullach and from there to the Bad Aibling station, where the NSA and BND have a joint headquarters.

== Presidents of the BND ==
The head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst is its President. The following persons have held this office since 1956:

The president of the BND is a federal Beamter paid according to BBesO order B, B9, which is in payment the equivalent of a lieutenant general.

=== Deputy ===
The President of the BND has three deputies: one Vice President, one Vice President for Military Affairs (Since December 2003), and one Vice President for Central Functions and Modernization (Possibly Since 2013). Prior to December 2003, there was only one Vice President. The following persons have held this office since 1957:

<text>The Vilnia (also Vilnelė; , &quot;Vilnia&quot; ; ) is a river primarily running through Eastern Lithuania. Its source is near the villages of and , 6 km south of Šumskas, nearby to the A3–M7 Medininkai–Kamenny Log border crossing complexes of the Belarus–Lithuania border for approximately 12 kilometers. 

== Geography ==
The Vilnia is 79.6 km long and its basin covers 624 sq. km. The river&#x27;s steepness is 124.6 metres from the source to the mouth. For 13 km, its flow marks the Belarus-Lithuania border, and the remaining 69 km are in Lithuania where it flows into the Neris River at Vilnius. Eventually, its waters, via the Neris draining into the Neman River, reach the Baltic Sea. Its confluence with the Neris lies within the city of Vilnius, and the river&#x27;s name is regarded to have been the source of the city&#x27;s name.

=== Sources ===
The springs along the Vilnia&#x27;s length contribute to its flow. Locals refer to the river&#x27;s starting source as the Holy Stream. A series of wells accessing the river&#x27;s groundwaters, drilled in the early 20th century, remained a major source of potable water for the city into the late 20th century.


== Naming ==

The name of the river derives from the Lithuanian language word &quot;vilnis&quot; (&quot;a surge&quot;) or &quot;vilnyti&quot; (&quot;to surge&quot;). Beneath it stands the Indo-European root wel-/wl- meaning &quot;to roll&quot;, &quot;to spin&quot;. &quot;Vilnelė&quot;, the diminutive form of the original hydronym &quot;Vilnia&quot;, came into popular use in Lithuanian and in Soviet times largely replaced the latter because of Polish language influence — Poles translated Lithuanian name of the river with such diminutive form (Wilenka).

== Fauna ==

Within the river basin, approximately 30 living species of fish and birds have protected status. In an effort to restore the upstream migration of salmonids in the basin, a fish ladder was constructed on the Vilnia in 2000.

<doc id="934835" wikidata="Q7428188" url="?curid=934835" title="Savers">
<text>Savers Value Village Inc. is a publicly held, for-profit thrift store retailer headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, United States, offering second hand merchandise, with supermajority ownership by private equity firm Ares Management. An international company, Savers has more than 315 locations throughout the United States of America, Canada, and Australia, and receives its merchandise by paying money to non-profit organizations for donated clothing and household items. Savers is known as Value Village in the Pacific Northwest, the Baltimore metropolitan area, and most of Canada, and Village des Valeurs in Quebec. Chicago stores and some locations in the Washington, DC metropolitan area are under the name Unique. In other regions of the U.S. and in Australia, the stores are named Savers.

==Business operations==
Savers&#x27; business model involves partnership with local non-profits and purchasing and reselling donated items. The non-profits collect and deliver donated goods to Savers, which pays them for the items at a bulk rate regardless of whether they ever make it to the sales floor. As of 2011, the company had paid $1.1 billion to approximately 130 nonprofit partners, and as of 2012, had 315 stores worldwide and reached $1 billion in revenue.

Items deemed resellable are displayed for purchase in stores. Savers also has a recycling program and attempts to recycle any reusable items that cannot be sold at the stores, as well as any items that do not sell over a period of time to make room for fresh merchandise. Savers has buyers for its recyclables throughout the world and attempts to keep as much donated product out of the waste stream as possible. 
In Minnesota, Savers pays non-profit partners $0.053 per pound of clothing, $0.035 per pound of homewares, $0.02 per pound of books and $0.02 per pound of large items (e.g., furniture). By the end of 2018, the company had discontinued the use of plastic bags in its stores.

According to Diabetes Canada, it has had a reusable goods donation program with Value Village where donations of clothing and small household items generate $5,000,000 CAD annually to support diabetes research.

== Ownership history ==
The company was founded by Bill Ellison in 1954 at a former movie theater in the Mission District of San Francisco, California. By 1970, the chain had six thrift stores in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington under various names, including Value Village and Thrift Village. The company&#x27;s headquarters were moved to Bellevue, Washington, in 1970 and expanded to Canada with a store in Vancouver that opened in 1980. Ellison was the board chairman of Value Village/Savers until 2000; he died in 2008.

Berkshire Partners bought a 50% stake in the company in 2000. Freeman Spogli &amp; Co. became the majority owner in 2006. Leonard Green &amp; Partners and TPG Capital bought out Freeman&#x27;s shares in 2012.

In March 2019, Savers reached a restructuring agreement to hand ownership of the company over to private equity firms Ares Management and Crescent Capital Group. Ares acquired Crescent&#x27;s stake in 2021 and took the company public in a June 29, 2023 initial public offering, retaining an 88% ownership stake.

==Controversy==
In May 2015, the Minnesota Attorney General filed suit claiming that Savers was misleading the public, paying only a very small percentage to the non-profit charities which partner with the company. Savers settled in June 2015, increasing transparency and paying $300,000 to each of its partner charities in Minnesota to compensate for fundraising disruptions. In the same year, the Attorney General filed suit against the Epilepsy Foundation for failing to monitor Savers for compliance with their partnership contract. Money raised through their partnership with Savers accounted for 38-50% of the Epilepsy Foundation&#x27;s revenue.

In November 2019 King County Superior Court Judge Roger Rogoff ruled that the corporation had misled the public into believing the organization was a charity, but the ruling was overturned in August 2021 by a Washington state appeals court. The Washington state Supreme Court further ruled that the Washington state Attorney General&#x27;s Office violated the corporation&#x27;s First Amendment rights. Subsequently, King County Superior Court Judge David Whedbee ruled that the state of Washington had to pay the corporation&#x27;s legal expenses due to the Attorney General&#x27;s Office&#x27;s aggressive litigation.

===Safety concerns===

In December 2018, a family in Pitt Meadows, British Columbia, Canada reported their six-year-old son found a hypodermic needle and two partially-used tubes of glue in a used Mouse Trap board game they had bought from a Value Village in Coquitlam, British Columbia.

In October 2019, a man reported getting a needlestick injury when he tried on a boot at a Value Village (in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada) and was told he would need blood tests including for HIV and hepatitis.

<doc id="934837" wikidata="Q1501898" url="?curid=934837" title="Sharpe ratio">
<text>In finance, the Sharpe ratio (also known as the Sharpe index, the Sharpe measure, and the reward-to-variability ratio) measures the performance of an investment such as a security or portfolio compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It is defined as the difference between the returns of the investment and the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the investment returns. It represents the additional amount of return that an investor receives per unit of increase in risk.

It was named after William F. Sharpe, who developed it in 1966.

==Definition==
Since its revision by the original author, William Sharpe, in 1994, the &quot;ex-ante&quot; Sharpe ratio is defined as:

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the asset return, formula_3 is the risk-free return (such as a U.S. Treasury security). formula_4 is the expected value of the excess of the asset return over the benchmark return, and formula_5 is the standard deviation of the asset excess return. The t-statistic will equal the Sharpe Ratio times the square root of T (the number of returns used for the calculation).

The &quot;ex-post&quot; Sharpe ratio uses the same equation as the one above but with realized returns of the asset and benchmark rather than expected returns; see the second example below.

The information ratio is a generalization of the Sharpe ratio that uses as benchmark some other, typically risky index rather than using risk-free returns.

==Use in finance==
The Sharpe ratio seeks to characterize how well the return of an asset compensates the investor for the risk taken. When comparing two assets, the one with a higher Sharpe ratio appears to provide better return for the same risk, which is usually attractive to investors.

However, financial assets are often not normally distributed, so that standard deviation does not capture all aspects of risk. Ponzi schemes, for example, will have a high empirical Sharpe ratio until they fail. Similarly, a fund that sells low-strike put options will have a high empirical Sharpe ratio until one of those puts is exercised, creating a large loss. In both cases, the empirical standard deviation before failure gives no real indication of the size of the risk being run.

Even in less extreme cases, a reliable empirical estimate of Sharpe ratio still requires the collection of return data over sufficient period for all aspects of the strategy returns to be observed. For example, data must be taken over decades if the algorithm sells an insurance that involves a high liability payout once every 5–10 years, and a high-frequency trading algorithm may only require a week of data if each trade occurs every 50 milliseconds, with care taken toward risk from unexpected but rare results that such testing did not capture (see flash crash).

Additionally, when examining the investment performance of assets with smoothing of returns (such as with-profits funds), the Sharpe ratio should be derived from the performance of the underlying assets rather than the fund returns (Such a model would invalidate the aforementioned Ponzi scheme, as desired).

Sharpe ratios, along with Treynor ratios and Jensen&#x27;s alphas, are often used to rank the performance of portfolio or mutual fund managers. Berkshire Hathaway had a Sharpe ratio of 0.79 for the period 1976 to 2017, higher than any other stock or mutual fund with a history of more than 30 years. The stock market had a Sharpe ratio of 0.49 for the same period.

==Tests==
Several statistical tests of the Sharpe ratio have been proposed. These include those proposed by Jobson &amp; Korkie and Gibbons, Ross &amp; Shanken.

==History==
In 1952, Andrew D. Roy suggested maximizing the ratio &quot;(m-d)/σ&quot;, where m is expected gross return, d is some &quot;disaster level&quot; (a.k.a., minimum acceptable return, or MAR) and σ is standard deviation of returns. This ratio is just the Sharpe ratio, only using minimum acceptable return instead of the risk-free rate in the numerator, and using standard deviation of returns instead of standard deviation of excess returns in the denominator. Roy&#x27;s ratio is also related to the Sortino ratio, which also uses MAR in the numerator, but uses a different standard deviation (semi/downside deviation) in the denominator.

In 1966, William F. Sharpe developed what is now known as the Sharpe ratio. Sharpe originally called it the &quot;reward-to-variability&quot; ratio before it began being called the Sharpe ratio by later academics and financial operators. The definition was:

:formula_6

Sharpe&#x27;s 1994 revision acknowledged that the basis of comparison should be an applicable benchmark, which changes with time. After this revision, the definition is:

:formula_7

Note, if formula_8 is a constant risk-free return throughout the period,
:formula_9

The (original) Sharpe ratio has often been challenged with regard to its appropriateness as a fund performance measure during periods of declining markets.

==Examples==
Example 1

Suppose the asset has an expected return of 15% in excess of the risk free rate. We typically do not know if the asset will have this return. We estimate the risk of the asset, defined as standard deviation of the asset&#x27;s excess return, as 10%. The risk-free return is constant. Then the Sharpe ratio using the old definition is formula_10

Example 2

An investor has a portfolio with an expected return of 12% and a standard deviation of 10%. The rate of interest is 5%, and is risk-free.

The Sharpe ratio is: formula_11

==Strengths and weaknesses==

A negative Sharpe ratio means the portfolio has underperformed its benchmark. All other things being equal, an investor typically prefers a higher positive Sharpe ratio as it has either higher returns or lower volatility. However, a negative Sharpe ratio can be made higher by either increasing returns (a good thing) or increasing volatility (a bad thing). Thus, for negative values the Sharpe ratio does not correspond well to typical investor utility functions.

The Sharpe ratio is convenient because it can be calculated purely from any observed series of returns without need for additional information surrounding the source of profitability. However, this makes it vulnerable to manipulation if opportunities exist for smoothing or discretionary pricing of illiquid assets. Statistics such as the bias ratio and first order autocorrelation are sometimes used to indicate the potential presence of these problems.

While the Treynor ratio considers only the systematic risk of a portfolio, the Sharpe ratio considers both systematic and idiosyncratic risks. Which one is more relevant will depend on the portfolio context.

The returns measured can be of any frequency (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or annually), as long as they are normally distributed, as the returns can always be annualized. Herein lies the underlying weakness of the ratio – asset returns are not normally distributed. Abnormalities like kurtosis, fatter tails and higher peaks, or skewness on the distribution can be problematic for the ratio, as standard deviation doesn&#x27;t have the same effectiveness when these problems exist.

For Brownian walk, Sharpe ratio formula_12 is a dimensional quantity and has units formula_13, because the excess return formula_14 and the volatility formula_15 are proportional to formula_13 and formula_17 correspondingly. Kelly criterion is a dimensionless quantity, and, indeed, Kelly fraction formula_18 is the numerical fraction of wealth suggested for the investment.

In some settings, the Kelly criterion can be used to convert the Sharpe ratio into a rate of return. The Kelly criterion gives the ideal size of the investment, which when adjusted by the period and expected rate of return per unit, gives a rate of return.

The accuracy of Sharpe ratio estimators hinges on the statistical properties of returns, and these properties can vary considerably among strategies, portfolios, and over time.

===Drawback as fund selection criteria===
Bailey and López de Prado (2012) show that Sharpe ratios tend to be overstated in the case of hedge funds with short track records. These authors propose a probabilistic version of the Sharpe ratio that takes into account the asymmetry and fat-tails of the returns&#x27; distribution. With regards to the selection of portfolio managers on the basis of their Sharpe ratios, these authors have proposed a &quot;Sharpe ratio indifference curve&quot; This curve illustrates the fact that it is efficient to hire portfolio managers with low and even negative Sharpe ratios, as long as their correlation to the other portfolio managers is sufficiently low.

Goetzmann, Ingersoll, Spiegel, and Welch (2002) determined that the best strategy to maximize a portfolio&#x27;s Sharpe ratio, when both securities and options contracts on these securities are available for investment, is a portfolio of selling one out-of-the-money call and selling one out-of-the-money put. This portfolio generates an immediate positive payoff, has a large probability of generating modestly high returns, and has a small probability of generating huge losses. Shah (2014) observed that such a portfolio is not suitable for many investors, but fund sponsors who select fund managers primarily based on the Sharpe ratio will give incentives for fund managers to adopt such a strategy.

In recent years, many financial websites have promoted the idea that a Sharpe Ratio &quot;greater than 1 is considered acceptable; a ratio higher than 2.0 is considered very good; and a ratio above 3.0 is excellent.&quot; While it is unclear where this rubric originated online, it makes little sense since the magnitude of the Sharpe ratio is sensitive to the time period over which the underlying returns are measured. This is because the nominator of the ratio (returns) scales in proportion to time; while the denominator of the ratio (standard deviation) scales in proportion to the square root of time. Most diversified indexes of equities, bonds, mortgages or commodities have annualized Sharpe ratios below 1, which suggests that a Sharpe ratio consistently above 2.0 or 3.0 is unrealistic.

<text>Zwingenberg () lies in the Bergstraße district in southern Hessen, Germany, south of Frankfurt and Darmstadt, and with the granting of town rights coming in 1274 it is the oldest town on the Hessen Bergstraße.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

Zwingenberg lies on the western edge of the Odenwald at the foot of the Melibokus, at 517.4 m above sea level the Bergstraße&#x27;s highest mountain. The municipal area&#x27;s elevation varies between roughly 90 m above sea level in the outlying centre of Rodau and just under 300 m on the slope of the Melibokus. Zwingenberg&#x27;s highest elevation is no one single mountain. Rather, it runs along the Melibokus&#x27;s slope into the area of Auerbach, an outlying centre of Bensheim. The 100-metre marker at Zwingenberg railway station is taken to be the standard. In the west, Zwingenberg abuts the &quot;Hessisches Ried&quot;, and thereby the Rhine rift.

In Zwingenberg&#x27;s west, towards Rodau and in Rodau itself, cropraising and meadows prevail. Only a small patch of woodland belongs to the municipal area near the Niederwaldsee (lake). In Zwingenberg there still exist remnants of, and even new fruit farming (mainly apples). On the outlying hills of the Orbishöhe (heights) and towards Luciberg is found winegrowing. Moreover, almond trees grow in the region. A narrower line of woodland in the municipal area can still be found in the area of the Morgenruhe foundry and running by way of Blockhütte towards Comoder Weg. Remains of granite quarrying can also still be made out.

Under the windbreak afforded by the Melibokus, a microclimate holds sway, which can in places near the slope lead to less precipitation than is found, for example, on the plain.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Zwingenberg lies between the community of Alsbach-Hähnlein in Darmstadt-Dieburg in the north and the town of Bensheim in Bergstraße district in the south. In the west Bensheim&#x27;s outlying centres of Fehlheim and Langwaden border on the outlying centre of Rodau. In the east Zwingenberg borders on the Melibokus, whose peak lies in the area of Auerbach, an outlying centre of Bensheim.

=== Constituent communities ===
Zwingenberg is made up of the two centres of Zwingenberg with an area of 346 hectares, and Rodau with an area of 215 hectares.

== Population development ==
As of 31 December 1971, the population figures include Rodau.

== History ==
“About when or by whom this town was built there is no information. That it is an ancient town can be gathered from all facts.” The earliest mention of &quot;locum getwinc&quot; is a document from 1015 in which Emperor Heinrich II donated hunting rights to the Lorsch Abbey. The placename Zwingenberg refers to how travellers on the Bergstraße were &quot;forced&quot; (in German &quot;gezwungen&quot;; infinitive &quot;zwingen&quot;) to pass through the town&#x27;s gates by the wetland and lowland forest that lay west of town.

Through his marriage to Hildegard von Henneberg, Henry II of Katzenelnbogen, whom King Konrad III raised to Count in 1138, had parts of the Bergstraße pass to him about 1135. Zwingenberg now belonged to the County of Katzenelnbogen with its seat at the like-named town. The county was divided into upper and lower halves, with the former lying on the Rhine around Sankt Goar and the latter in southern Hessen.

To guard his southern holdings on the Bergstraße and his toll income, Count Diether IV built a lower castle in Zwingenberg and a high castle, the Auerbacher Schloss, above Auerbach.

In 1258, Diether V received the right to build a church in Zwingenberg:

:Cathedral Provost Werner, Cathedral Deacon Johann and the Chapter at Mainz as well as Provost Ludwig of St. Viktor thereat evince that the inhabitants of Zwingenberg can only reach their mother church in Bensheim to hear God&#x27;s word and receive the Sacraments with difficulty owing to the great distance and danger to life. They allow therefore with the Archbishop&#x27;s approval at the request of the worldly lord in Zwingenberg, Count Diether of Katzenelnbogen, a church with graveyard to be built in Zwingenberg and a priest of its own to be appointed.

In 1260, the county was partitioned between Diether V and his brother Eberhard I, with Diether taking Zwingenberg and Eberhard Auerbach.

Zwingenberg was granted town and market rights under Count Diether V and King Rudolf of Habsburg, thereby becoming the oldest town on the Bergstraße.

In 1301, Zwingenberg was destroyed and went up in flames. Count Wilhelm I of Katzenelnbogen, Diether V&#x27;s son, had allied himself with four Rhenish electors and raised tolls on the Rhine, the upshot to which was damage to free trade and a declaration of war from King Albrecht I. The Lower Castle was destroyed, too.

In 1330, Emperor Louis the Bavarian confirmed to Count Wilhelm I Zwingenberg&#x27;s town rights:

:Emperor Louis confirms to the Count Wilhelm of Katzenelnbogen for faithful services the freedom that King Rudolf granted him for Zwingenberg, and the freedom that he granted him for Reichenberg, as well as the Rhine upstream toll at Sankt Goar that Count Wilhelm and his forefathers have held in fief from the Empire. Whoever undertakes anything against it shall pay with 100 Marks of gold, half of which shall fall to the Chamber of the Empire and half to the Count.

In 1355, Wilhelm II took wedding vows with Elisabeth of Hanau. This involved providing for her in her widowhood with, among other things, a widow&#x27;s seat for her in Darmstadt.

In 1401, the town&#x27;s name was catalogued as &quot;Twinginburg&quot;.

In 1403, Count Johann IV Katzenelnbogen an Henne Weißkreis von Lindenfels pledged the castle and town of Zwingenberg with the villages of Eschollbrücken – which the Count owned – Pfungstadt and Nieder-Ramstadt with all rights and appurtenances for 6,000 Gulden, which the Count later redeemed.

In 1454, Count Philipp I of Katzenlenbogen agreed that Hans IV of Wallbrunn (whose seat was Wallbrunn) should provide a widowhood estate for his wife Lucie von Reifenberg consisting of, among other things, the house and a number of gardens at Zwingenberg, which Hans held from the Count as a fief, although without the military service obligation.

Until 1479, Zwingenberg belonged to the County of Katzenelnbogen, thereafter to the Landgraviate of Hessen, and as of 1567 to the Landgraviate of Hessen-Darmstadt, which in 1806 was raised to the Grand Duchy of Hessen.

Owing to the abandonments during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and shortly thereafter the Plague, the town was for decades almost uninhabited, and eventually, a fire set by French troops in 1693 destroyed most of the houses. Only after the French Revolution did the town recover.

In 1832, Zwingenberg was grouped into the Bensheim district, and as of 1938 it belonged to Bergstraße district. In the time of National Socialism, Jews and the Nazis&#x27; political foes were driven out and deported. By chance, the synagogue was not destroyed. It is nowadays used as a house. There is a club that has made it its business to revive the synagogue. In 1941, a prisoner-of-war camp was set up at the youth hostel.

On 31 December 1971, Rodau was amalgamated with Zwingenberg.

== Politics ==
=== Town council ===

The composition of the town council after the four latest municipal elections:

=== Mayors ===
From 2001 to 2007, Dieter Kullak (independent) held office. At the election on 25 March 2007, in which Kullak was not a candidate, Holger Habich (FDP, but also supported by the CDU) was victorious. He was re-elected in 2013 and 2019.

On 23 February 2025, Sebastian Clever (CDU) won with 54.9% and a voter turnout of 83.4% against the independent candidate Stefan Juchems, who is a member of the Green Party. The new mayor&#x27;s term of office begins on 1 May 2025.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Party per fess Or a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure and azure three waterlily leaves argent.

The red lion rampant is from the arms borne by the old Counts of Katzenelnbogen. This same charge can also be seen in Darmstadt’s, Pfungstadt’s and Auerbach’s arms, and they are all parted per pale (that is, horizontally across the middle), just as Zwingenberg’s arms are.

=== Town partnerships ===
* Pierrefonds, Oise, France since 1968
* Brisighella, Emilia-Romagna, Italy
* Tetbury, Gloucestershire, England, United Kingdom since 1981
* Eckartsberga, Saxony-Anhalt

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Although the economy was formerly largely based on agriculture and winegrowing, as well as gastronomy, since then, besides a great number of commercial enterprises, a series of smaller and midsize technology businesses has arisen.

=== Established businesses ===
* BRAIN Biotechnology Research and Information Network GmbH (biotechnological and genetic-technological research)
* Preussag Wasser und Rohrtechnik GmbH (water and pipe technology – environmental technology branch)
* PWT Wasser- und Abwassertechnik GmbH (water and sewage)
* Resin Express GmbH (plastic granulate distribution)
* SurTec Deutschland GmbH (chemical products and processes for surfacing technology)

=== Transport ===

Zwingenberg is linked to the A 5 (Frankfurt-Basel) by interchange 29, and Zwingenberg is also signposted on the A 67 at the Gernsheim interchange (8). Frankfurt Airport is 45 km away, and the riverport at Gernsheim on the Rhine is 12 km away.

Parallel to the Odenwald runs the Bergstraße (federal highway B 3), which in Zwingenberg splits into the “New” and “Old” Bergstraße, which come back together again near Darmstadt-Eberstadt.

The relief road originally planned for the B 3, called the &quot;Berliner Ring&quot;, is open in parts. The road, running parallel to the B 3, comes from Bensheim and leads back to the B 3 in Zwingenberg. Original plans to relieve the (very low – about 2.95 m) railway bridge by building another bridge farther north failed in the face of protests from residents and the neighbouring community through whose municipal area parts of the road would have run.

One of Germany&#x27;s most heavily travelled railways, the Main-Neckar Railway (Frankfurt-Darmstadt-Heidelberg/Mannheim), runs through Zwingenberg. Zwingenberg station is served hourly by Regionalbahn trains. These are reinforced by other trains in rush hours.

Modern bus links of busline 669 run by Darmstadt&#x27;s HEAG mobilo link the town with Jugenheim and Heppenheim.

=== Leisure and sport facilities ===
Zwingenberg has at its disposal a small sporting ground with grass and a complete athletics facility, a paved ground and a field. Moreover, there are several tennis courts and two sport halls. Rodau likewise has a grass playing field.

For 2015, there are plans to build a modern sport park in which all locally played sports will be represented.

==Culture and sightseeing==
Zwingenberg lies on the edge of the Odenwald on the heights of the Melibokus on a relatively steep slope. The surrounding town wall is to a great extent still visible.

The &quot;Obergasse&quot; (“Upper Lane”) is the old &quot;getwinc&quot;, the thoroughfare that led through the town&#x27;s lower and upper gates. The street&#x27;s alignment was only slightly changed after the fire of 1693 and still more or less shows the position of the old Bergstraße.

The “New Pass” was until the 15th century still wetland. Today the B 3 runs here along the historic town wall through town. Between &quot;Schlößchen&quot; and &quot;Neugasse&quot; the remains of the town wall form the back walls of the houses and barns on &quot;Untergasse&quot; (“Lower Lane”)

Including the outlying centre of Rodau, Zwingenberg has 81 cultural monuments under monumental protection.

=== Buildings ===

The town has a touristically attractive Old Town with timber-frame houses that are interesting both as buildings and as the history that they represent, a mountain church (&quot;Bergkirche&quot;) and a former castle seat, enfeoffed by Johann von Katzenelnbogen to Hans von Wallbrunn the Elder in 1420.

At Zwingenberg&#x27;s highest spot stands today&#x27;s youth hostel, a former tithe barn built on a bastion’s foundation. Of the round corner towers of the upper town wall, only the &quot;Aul&quot; has been preserved. It is the northeast tower, a two-floor tower made of undressed quarrystones.

The remains of the moated castle may well be Zwingenberg’s oldest building. Outwards from this about 1250, the town fortifications took shape. The “New Marketplace” arose at the beginning of the 17th century on the former moated castle&#x27;s lands and the moat itself.

The old &quot;Amtsgericht&quot; (“&quot;Amt&quot; court”) was built between 1561 and 1563 and restored in 1989. It originally served the Hessian landgraves as a hunting palace.

The &quot;Schlößchen&quot; (“Little Palace”), built about 1520, has served the town since 1969 as the Town Hall. Next to it stands the former guesthouse &quot;Zum Löwen&quot; (“To the Lion”). It was built in 1595 and is the oldest building in existence outside the old town wall. Across the street from it lies the &quot;Scheuergasse&quot; (lane) formed by two rows of side-gabled barns. These were built outside the old town wall owing to the danger from fire, and today are used mainly as dwellings, offices and guesthouses.

The vaulted cellar under the &quot;Alte Apotheke&quot; (“Old Apothecary’s Shop”), which stands on the marketplace, seems to go back to the time when the town wall was built. Later, the &quot;Alte Apotheke&quot; was known as &quot;großherzogliche Apotheke von Katzenellenbogen&quot; (the first word meaning “Grand-Ducal”), and was built in 1783.

=== Wine and culinary specialities ===
Zwingenberg is part of the small winegrowing region of Hessische Bergstraße which is known for herb wines. On the slopes of the Melibokus lie, within the &quot;Auerbacher Rott&quot; growing region, the locations of &quot;Zwingenberger Steingeröll&quot; and &quot;Zwingenberger Alte Burg&quot;. Abutting them to the north is the location of &quot;Alsbacher Schöntal&quot;. White grape varieties grown here include Sylvaner, Riesling, Müller-Thurgau and Morio Muscat. Asparagus and strawberry farming characterize the flatter areas towards Rodau. Typical for Zwingenberg, therefore, are a robust dry Riesling and mellow asparagus dishes.

=== Theatre ===
In the vaulted cellar under the former &quot;Amtsgericht&quot; is found the &quot;Theater Mobile&quot;, which puts on its own and others’ productions mainly in the fields of music, reading, children&#x27;s theatre, dance and cabaret.

=== Museums ===
The &quot;Heimatmuseum&quot; (local history) on historic Scheuergasse shows old handicrafts and historically decorated rooms.

In June 2005, the information centre &quot;Blüten, Stein &amp; Wein&quot; (“Blossoms, Stone and Wine”) of the UNESCO &quot;Geopark Bergstraße-Odenwald&quot; opened at the community centre &quot;Bunter Löwe&quot; (“Colourful Lion”). The information centre, which is open at weekends and after notification, also houses the tourist information centre.

== Famous people ==

=== Honorary citizens ===
The town&#x27;s first honorary citizen was the Reverend Adam Höfle (1900–1999).

=== Sons and daughters of the town ===

* Theodor Loos (1883–1954), actor

=== Famous people with ties to the town ===

* Heinrich von Gagern (1799–1880) politician, in the preliminary convention (&quot;Vorparlament&quot;) of Frankfurt for the electoral district of Zwingenberg.
* Henry Kissinger, (born 1923), who acted as an agent in the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps in Bensheim, lived for a few months at the Arthur-Sauer-Villa in Zwingenberg, which was requisitioned for him.
* Arthur Sauer (1887-1946), (chemist), joined the &quot;Deutsche Milchwerke&quot; pharmaceutical plant founded by Worms apothecary Rudolf Pizzala in 1897, and took the business over in 1898. Out of this grew the later &quot;Fissan-Werke&quot; (1924). By 1934, the firm already had 160 workers and employees, as well as 50 others employed in sales. His vehicle is today on display at the &quot;Technikmuseum Speyer&quot;

<text>Remote Radar Head Benbecula or RRH Benbecula, is an air defence radar station operated by the Royal Air Force. It is located at Cleitreabhal a&#x27;Deas, from Lochmaddy on the isle of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.

The radar site was previously known as RAF Benbecula, the name having previously been associated with an RAF airfield on the island of Benbecula (now known as Benbecula Airport) and a nearby weapons testing range (now known as MoD Hebrides).

== History ==

=== Radar station ===
Although Benbecula Airport is now a civilian airfield, a military presence remained and the RAF Benbecula name continued when a radar station was established. A control and reporting centre, part of the UK Air Surveillance And Control System (ASACS), was constructed at the airfield which linked it to RAF Buchan in Aberdeenshire.

The station was downgraded in the late 1990s to a remote radar head and the RAF pulled-out of the main airfield site at Benbecula. Initially under the command and control of RAF Buchan, responsibility was transferred to RAF Boulmer in Northumberland in September 2004.

Benbecula operated several radar types until the Type 92 (more widely known out-with RAF service as the Lockheed Martin AN/FPS-117 ) came into service in the 1980s. The Type 92 was replaced in 2015 with a new Lockheed Martin AN/TPS-77 system. The new radar was funded by wind farm developers and was installed in order to help reduce the impact of interference from wind turbines.

=== Weapons range ===
The British Army also had a large presence in the Outer Hebrides, operating the Deep Sea Range on South Uist. This role was passed to the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (eventually to become QinetiQ), who remain at the Benbecula and South Uist sites, collectively known as MOD Hebrides.

== Operations ==
The radar collects data as part of the UK Air Surveillance And Control System (ASACS) based at RAF Boulmer. From there the station is monitored and controlled to support the creation of the recognised air picture for the United Kingdom. The radar site also accommodates several types of VHF and UHF ground-to-air transmitters.

Radar Flight (North) of the ASACS Engineering &amp; Logistics Squadron based at RAF Boulmer has command and control of RRH Buchan and ensures its operational availability.

As part of a major upgrade of RRH sites around the UK the MOD began a programme titled HYDRA in 2020 to install new communications buildings, radar towers and perimeter security.

<text>Poundsgate is a small village in Dartmoor, Devon, England, located on the road between Ashburton and Princetown.

The postal area of &quot;Poundsgate&quot; is a wide geographical area. There are a few cottages clustered around a popular stopping point for travellers, the Tavistock Inn, which is thought to date back to the 13th century. There are also many farms in and around the village. At one time there was a shop, a post office and a garage.

Poundsgate takes its name from the pound situated on the left-hand side of the road just past the last house when travelling toward Princetown. This house was once a smithy, the post office, the telephone exchange and a bakery. Poundsgate is situated in the ecclesiastical parish of Leusdon, the civic parish of Widecombe and within the manor of Spitchwick.

It is even said to have been visited by the Devil (see the Great Thunderstorm, Widecombe).

The early novels &quot;Falcons of Narabedla&quot; and &quot;The Door Through Space&quot; are listed by some sources as part of the &quot;Darkover&quot; series (as noted below), but although they presage some themes and images with the main sequence, these do not take place on Darkover, and are in other ways inconsistent with the series.

<text>Hans Hartwig von Beseler (27 April 1850 – 20 December 1921) was a German colonel general.

== Biography ==

Beseler was born in Greifswald, Pomerania as the son of Georg Beseler, then a law professor at the University of Greifswald. 

=== Military career ===
He entered the Prussian Army in 1868, fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 and had a successful military career until his retirement in 1910. Beseler was ennobled in 1904 by William II, German Emperor.

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Beseler was brought out of retirement and given command of the 3rd Reserve Corps in the German First Army led by Generaloberst Alexander von Kluck. The Imperial German Army took Brussels on 20 August and the German command considered the Belgian Army defeated. The main force of the German armies marched toward France, leaving the 3rd Reserve Corps behind. Beseler was ordered to take possession of the city of Antwerp on 9 September. The Siege of Antwerp ended on 10 October, when Antwerp&#x27;s Mayor Jan De Vos, surrendered the city. Beseler followed the Belgian army and was halted by Allied (mainly Belgian) forces in the Battle of the Yser (October 1914).

In the spring of 1915, Beseler was sent to the Eastern Front with Max von Gallwitz&#x27;s 9th Army. There he led the successful siege of Novogeorgievsk in August 1915.

=== Administrative career ===
On 27 August 1915 Beseler was made Military Governor of the German-occupied part of the zone of Polish lands, or Congress Poland, and served as such until the end of the war. Beseler hoped to assemble three divisions of Polish volunteers for use by the Central Powers, and to this end wanted to present a &quot;facade of independent Poland&quot;. His official title was Governor-general of . Beseler gave his support to the Polish Border Strip plan, which would have seen mass expulsions of Poles and Jews from territory annexed by the German Empire from formerly Russian-held parts of Poland, and subsequent colonization of this area by German settlers.

In November 1915, Beseler reopened the University of Warsaw and the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute and allowed the usage of the Polish language at the university for the first time since 1869. Municipal councils were elected and the lower jurisdiction was organized by Polish locals. Despite these efforts, German intentions were transparent, and German rule was not well tolerated by the Poles. German calls for Polish volunteers produced disappointing results. Most Poles saw an Allied victory as the best hope for genuine independence.

After the Central Powers&#x27; Act of 5th November of 1916 held out the prospect of limited Polish autonomy, Beseler stayed and still wielded real power as the General Governor of the Government General of Warsaw, the German-occupied part of the Kingdom of Poland, alongside the Austrian Governor General , who resided in Lublin. Beseler was also the titular commander of the so-called Polnische Wehrmacht. After the Act of 5 November was declared, he organized a ceremony in Warsaw&#x27;s Royal Castle with such gestures as the unfurling of a Polish flag and the playing of the Polish national anthem; the event backfired as the Polish crowds started shouting &quot;Out with the Germans!&quot;. On 4 October 1916 Beseler issued a decree allowing forced labour by Polish men aged between 18 and 45.
After Poland declared independence on 11 November 1918 and all German soldiers in Warsaw were disarmed, Beseler fled in disguise to Germany. A broken and disillusioned man, attacked by the German Conservatives and Nationalists as having been too liberal towards the Poles, but disliked in Poland for being too Prussian, Beseler died in 1921 in Neubabelsberg near Potsdam. He was buried at the Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin.

<doc id="934894" wikidata="Q2353087" url="?curid=934894" title="Chancellor of Justice">
<text>The Chancellor of Justice is a government official found in some northern European countries, broadly responsible for supervising the lawfulness of government actions.

== History ==
In 1713, the Swedish King Charles XII, preoccupied with fighting the Great Northern War, was residing in Bendery and had not set foot in Sweden in over a decade. In order to re-establish the domestic administration, which had fallen into disarray, he instituted the office of His Majesty&#x27;s Supreme Ombudsman, which soon became the Chancellor of Justice. The office commenced operation on October 23, 1714, and the role of the official was to ensure that judges and public officials acted in accordance with the laws, proficiently discharged their tasks, and if not he could initiate legal proceedings for dereliction of duty. This was the origin of the ombudsman institution in Sweden.

The current name was adopted in 1719, by the Instrument of Government of the same year. The Chancellor acted only on behalf of the royal government. In the Instrument of Government of 1809, a counterpart to act on the behalf of Parliament was instituted as the Parliamentary Ombudsman.

==Duties==
The duties of the Chancellor of Justice may include to:
* be the Government&#x27;s counsellor in legal matters;
* be the State&#x27;s representative in trials and other legal disputes;
* receive complaints and claims for damages made against the State and decide on financial compensation for such damages;
* act as ombudsman in the supervision of the authorities and the civil servants, and to take action in cases of abuse;
* ensure that the limits of the freedom of the press and other media are not transgressed and to act as the only public prosecutor in cases regarding offences against the freedom of the press and other media;
* act as the guardian for the protection of privacy.

== Sweden ==
In Sweden, the Chancellor of Justice () is a government official charged with representing the Swedish government in various legal matters as the government&#x27;s ombudsman. The Chancellor is appointed by the Government of Sweden and serves at the pleasure of the cabinet without belonging to the spoils system, the longest term in office thus far having been 22 years. The present Chancellor of Justice is Anna Skarhed, who entered office on December 9, 2009.

==Finland==

The Chancellor of Justice of Finland (, ) is a Finnish government official who supervises authorities&#x27; (such as cabinet ministers and other public officials) compliance with the law and advances legal protection for Finnish citizens. The Chancellor investigates complaints against authorities&#x27; activities and may also start an investigation on his own initiative. The Chancellor attends cabinet meetings as a non-voting member to ensure that legal procedures and regulations are followed. The Chancellor has wide-ranging powers of oversight, investigation and prosecution.

The Chancellor (and Deputy) is appointed by the President of Finland. The Chancellor is appointed for life, but is required to retire at the age of 68, in line with all other Finnish civil servants. The Chancellor of Justice from 2018 will be Tuomas Pöysti, LL.D., replacing Jaakko Jonkka, LL.D.

== Estonia ==
The Estonian Chancellor of Justice () is an independent supervisor of the basic principles of the Constitution of Estonia and the protector of individual rights. The institution seeks to ensure that authorities fulfil the obligations deriving from the principles of the rule of law and protection of human and social rights, human dignity, freedom, equality and democracy. The Chancellor of Justice is appointed to office by the Riigikogu (parliament) on the proposal of the President for a seven-year term. The Current Chancellor of Justice is Ülle Madise, who has been in office since 2015.

<doc id="934897" wikidata="Q970743" url="?curid=934897" title="Sudebnik of 1497">
<text>The Sudebnik of 1497 (), also known as the Sudebnik of Ivan III (), was a collection of laws introduced by Ivan III in 1497. It played a big part in the centralisation of the Russian state, the creation of all-Russian legislation, and the elimination of feudal fragmentation. It was later replaced by the Sudebnik of 1550 under Ivan IV.

==Content==
The &quot;Sudebnik&quot; replaced the former legal charters of different Russian principalities as a code for the entire state. It set up an order of court procedures and legal norms, binding uniformly on all parts of the state and strengthening the central authority in Moscow.

The &quot;Sudebnik&quot; takes its roots from earlier law codes, including the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;, the Pskov Judicial Charter, princely decrees, and common law, the regulations of which had been upgraded with reference to social and economic changes. The &quot;Sudebnik&quot; was overall a collection of legal procedures. It established a universal system of the judicial bodies of the state, defined their competence and subordination, and regulated legal fees. The &quot;Sudebnik&quot; expanded the range of acts considered punishable by the standards of criminal justice (e.g., sedition, sacrilege, slander). It also renewed the concept of different kinds of a crime. &quot;Sudebnik&quot; established the investigative nature of legal proceedings. It provided different kinds of punishment, such as the death penalty and flagellation. In order to protect the feudal landownership, &quot;Sudebnik&quot; introduced certain limitations in the law of estates, increased the term of limitation of legal actions with regards to princely lands, introduced flagellation for the violation of property boundaries of princely, boyar and monastic lands – violation of peasant land boundaries entailed a fine. The &quot;Sudebnik&quot; also introduced a fee (&quot;пожилое&quot;, or pozhiloye) for peasants who wanted to leave their feudal lord (&quot;Крестьянский выход&quot;, or Krestiyansky vykhod), and also established a universal day (November 26) across the Russian state for peasants who wanted to switch their masters (&quot;Юрьев день&quot;, or Yuri&#x27;s Day).

<text>Lindenfels is a town in the Bergstraße district in Hesse, Germany.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The climatic spa, also known as the “Pearl of the Odenwald”, lies in the Odenwald in southern Hesse and is nestled in a mountain landscape with a great deal of woodland.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Lindenfels borders in the south on the communities of Modautal and Fischbachtal (both in Darmstadt-Dieburg), in the northeast on the community of Fränkisch-Crumbach, in the east on the community of Reichelsheim (both in the Odenwaldkreis), in the south on the community of Fürth, and in the west on the community of Lautertal.
=== Constituent communities ===
Lindenfels has outlying centres named Eulsbach, Glattbach, Kolmbach, Schlierbach, Seidenbuch, Winkel and Winterkasten.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.lindenfels.de/sites/daten/statistik.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1123, Lindenfels had its first documentary mention as a holding of the Lorsch Abbey. After that, the town belonged for nearly 600 years to the Electorate of the Palatinate. In 1336, Emperor Ludwig IV granted Lindenfels town and market rights. In 1802, after the Electorate of the Palatinate’s downfall, Lindenfels passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and was from 1821 to 1832 seat of the &quot;Landratsbezirk&quot; of Lindenfels. Later, from 1852 to 1874, it was the seat of the Lindenfels district.

After the Second World War ended in May 1945, Lindenfels found itself in the American Zone of Occupation. The US military administration built a displaced persons camp to house displaced Jews. The camp was dissolved in 1948.

The designation &quot;heilklimatischer Kurort&quot; (“climatic spa”) was granted Lindenfels in 1969.

== Politics ==

=== Community council ===

The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:
=== Mayor ===
*2001–2013: Oliver Hoeppner (LWG/CDU)
*2013-incumbent: Michael Helbig

=== Town partnerships ===
* Moëlan-sur-Mer, Finistère, France since 1968
* Pawłowiczki, Opole Voivodeship, Poland since 1998

== Regular events ==
Among the most important yearly events held in town are:
* the traditional &quot;Burg- und Trachtenfest&quot; (“Castle and Costume Festival”) on the first weekend in August, with fireworks, parade and folk festival at the castle;
* the &quot;Mittelalterliche Spektakulum&quot; (“Mediaeval Spectacle”) in May, with knightly games;
* &quot;Brauchtumstage&quot; (“Custom Days”) in October, at which old Odenwald customs and arts and crafts are presented.

== Buildings ==
* In the middle of town stand the Lindenfels castle ruins, which today serve as a popular outing destination. There is also a view into the distance over the Weschnitz valley.
* The &quot;Bismarck-Warte&quot; – one of many Bismarck memorial towers – is found on the Litzelröder Höhe (heights), 452 m above sea level. It was built in 1906 and 1907 by the &quot;Verschönerungs- und Verkehrsverein&quot; (“Beautification and Transport Club”) and &quot;Odenwaldklub Lindenfels&quot;. The tower is 12.3 m tall and freely open to the public. In 1997 and 1998, the tower was thoroughly restored. Up a stairway inside, one can reach the visitable platform which affords an enjoyable view worthy of seeing of the valleys around Lindenfels.
* Further sights worthy of seeing are the house &quot;Baur de Betaz&quot;, the inner and outer &quot;Fürther Tor&quot; (gate) and various timber-frame houses and Baroque buildings, which line the pedestrian precinct towards the castle (among these are the Town Hall and the Catholic church).
* Near Lindenfels on the Krehberg (mountain) at position is found a 122 m-tall transmission tower run by Deutsche Telekom AG for VHF and microwave relay. The said tower consists of a freestanding steel-lattice base upon which a guyed transmission mast is mounted.

== Famous people ==

=== Sons and daughters of the town ===
* Thomas Heinze (b. 30 March 1964), actor
* Timo Glock (b. 18 March 1982), Formula One racer
* Sebastian Kneißl (b. 13 January 1983), German footballer

<text>Remote Radar Head Saxa Vord or RRH Saxa Vord (aka RAF Saxa Vord), is a Royal Air Force radar station located on the island of Unst, the most northern of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. As of July 2019 it is once more a fully operational radar station, after closure in 2006. The station&#x27;s motto &quot;Praemoneo de Periculis&quot; (&#x27;Premonition of Peril&#x27;) reflects its role.
RAF Saxa Vord is further north than Saint Petersburg in Russia, and on the same latitude as Anchorage, Alaska. The station was named after Saxa Vord, which is the highest hill on Unst at . It holds the unofficial British record for wind speed, which in 1992 was recorded at — just before the measuring equipment blew away.

==History==
=== Early years ===
The island of Unst has played an important part in the defence of the UK since the outbreak of the Second World War. By 1945, there were two radar sites on the island; one on Saxa Vord hill, and the other at Skaw on the east coast. This latter is the older, being built in 1941, and was part of the Chain Home radar network as part of the defences of the RAF Sullom Voe flying boat base. Skaw closed in 1947, with Historic Environment Scotland describing its remains as &quot;a remarkably well-preserved military complex...&quot; [with] &quot;an important part to play in the story of the defence of the United Kingdom during World War Two.&quot;

===ROTOR era===
As part of the post-war ROTOR radar network, Saxa Vord was selected as the site to host a new long-range radar as the northernmost point in a network of radars covering the entirety of the British Isles. As part of upgrades carried out for ROTOR, Saxa received new radars, the AMES Type 14 medium-range search radar, and associated AMES Type 13 height finders.

While these were being built, a dramatically more powerful system was entering prototype use, the AMES Type 80. The Type 80 had an effective range over , covering the entire Shetland Islands and a significant portion of the Norwegian Sea. The coverage was so vast that there was much less need to tie together multiple stations to provide a wide-area view, and the ROTOR system began to be progressively downgraded to individual Master Radar Stations. Installation of Saxa&#x27;s Type 80 began in 1955, but was blown off its mountings by winds gusting to in January 1956.

A new antenna design capable of handling winds of this magnitude was designed as the Mark II, and replaced the original later that year. No. 91 Signals Unit officially formed up at Saxa Vord on 27 September 1957, was declared operational on 5 October 1957, and in 1960 was visited by Queen Elizabeth II.

During this period the Type 14 was retained as a backup system until September 1964, whilst the Type 13 remained the primary height finder until 1978/79. The Type 80 was lost when it was blown away on 26 January 1961 and rebuilt inside a new radome. At the time, Saxa Vord consisted of three sites: the domestic site, the technical site (with the radars) and the married quarters called Setters Hill Estate (SHE). In the early days, the site was shared with the Royal Navy.

===Linesman era===
While the system was being built, serious concerns emerged over the introduction of the carcinotron, a new type of radar jammer that rendered the Type 80 almost useless. A new network using anti-jamming radars was introduced, the Linesman/Mediator system. In the new network, there was no point in Saxa attempting to remain operational against jammers, so it retained its Type 80 while other stations in the chain were upgraded with the new AMES Type 84 and AMES Type 85.

Linesman ran into significant delays, and entered service in limited form in 1973, years later than planned. By 1976, the Type 80 had been in operation for decades and was long overdue for a replacement for maintenance reasons alone. This led to the introduction of a AMES Type 96 (Marconi S649), which had two radar aerials mounted back-to-back, one operating at D band and the other at F and E bands (three transmitters/receivers in total). The decades-old Type 13 was replaced by the newer Plessey HF200 in the height-finder role.
In September 1976 a £10 million contract was given to Marconi and Plessey, for a project to be led by Marconi and built by Cementation.

In 1984 the station was renamed from No. 91 Signals Unit to Royal Air Force Saxa Vord. The signals unit badge was adopted by the station and it continued with the motto of &quot;Praemoneo de periculis&quot; (Latin for &quot;I give advanced warning about danger&quot;).

===IUKADGE era===
By the time Linesman was operational it was considered outdated; much of the equipment was based on decades-old designs, and built using components that were no longer available. Even before it was declared operational the decision had been made to replacing it as soon as possible, A new system, IUKADGE, emerged during a several-year definition process. The system was implemented at Saxa Vord in 1993. This was part of NATO-wide upgrades and the funding for the new radar was provided from the NATO funding pool. This led to one of the six IUKADGE AMES Type 93s being earmarked for Saxa.

=== Downgrading to Remote Radar Head ===
While the upgrades were taking place, the Warsaw Pact was dissolving and the Soviet Union ceased to exist. The number of intruder flights collapsed and there was no sign they would be returning. From around 2000 until 2 April 2004, the station operated as Remote Radar Head (RRH) Saxa Vord, operated from parent station RAF Buchan. On 2 April 2004, RAF Saxa Vord was upgraded from a Remote Radar Head to a fully staffed station, taking over control of the radar defences in the area.

=== Closure ===
In 2005, the RAF announced that RRH Saxa Vord would close. The Type 93 radar was approaching obsolescence and was increasingly difficult to maintain. It was considered that with a reduced threat, funding would be diverted to other defence priorities.

RRH Saxa Vord closed in April 2006 with the site being placed on programme of care and maintenance and the radar being dismantled and used for spares in other Type 93 radars.

In April 2007, Saxa Vord&#x27;s Domestic Site and the road up to the Mid Site were bought by Military Asset Management (MAM).

===Reactivation as RRH===
In September 2017, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that £10 million would be invested in Saxa Vord to reactivate the site as a Remote Radar Head. The move will provide better coverage of the airspace to the north of the UK, in response to increased Russian military activity. Work began in October 2017 to move a Lockheed Martin AN/TPS-77 L-band radar from RRH Staxton Wold in North Yorkshire to Saxa Vord.

During January 2018, Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier visited the site to inspect progress and the new radar reached initial operational capability. It was expected to reach full operational capability by the end of 2018.

As part of a major upgrade of RRH sites around the UK the MOD began a programme titled HYDRA in 2020 to install new communications buildings, radar towers and perimeter security.

Nobody will be permanently based at Saxa Vord, but regular visits will take place for maintenance purposes.

Some of the former base facilities have now been redeveloped into new roles. Planning permission for the SaxaVord Spaceport was initially denied by Historic Environment Scotland citing the damage to the surviving World War Two structures; however, in January 2022 the objection was withdrawn, stating &quot;We recognise the benefits that this development will bring to the community in Unst&quot;. Construction and static fires have subsequently taken place, with an orbital launch expected sometime in 2025. The Saxa Vord distillery is also located on the site.

<text>William Sowden Sims (October 15, 1858 – September 28, 1936) was an admiral in the United States Navy who fought during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to modernize the navy. During World War I, he commanded all United States naval forces operating in Europe. He also served twice as president of the Naval War College.

==Career==
Sims was born to American father Alfred William (1826–1895) and Canadian mother Adelaide (née Sowden; b. 1835) living in Port Hope, Canada West. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1880, the beginnings of an era of naval reform and greater professionalization. Commodore Stephen B. Luce founded the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island in 1884, to be the service&#x27;s professional school. During the same era, Naval War College instructor Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was writing influential books on naval strategy and sea power.

In March 1897, shortly after his promotion to lieutenant, Sims was assigned as the military attaché to Paris and St. Petersburg. In this position he became aware of naval technology developments in Europe as well gaining familiarity with European politics which would greatly assist him during World War I. He was in this assignment during the Spanish–American War during which Sims was able to use his diplomatic connections to gain information on Spain and its high-ranking officials.

===Gunnery===
As a young officer, Sims sought to reform naval gunnery by improving target practice. His superiors resisted his suggestions, failing to see the necessity. He was also hindered by his low rank. In 1902, Sims wrote directly to President Theodore Roosevelt. The president, who had previously served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, was intrigued by Sims&#x27; ideas and made him the Navy&#x27;s Inspector of Naval Gunnery on November 5, 1902, shortly after which Sims was promoted to lieutenant commander. He was promoted to commander in 1907.

From 1911 to 1912, Sims attended the Naval War College. Promoted to captain in 1911, he became Commander, Atlantic Destroyer Flotilla in July 1913.

On March 11, 1916, Sims became the first captain of the battleship . &quot;Nevada&quot; was the largest, most modern and most powerful ship in the U.S. Navy at that time. His selection as her captain shows the esteem in which he was held in the Navy.

===First World War===
Shortly before the United States entered World War I, then Rear Admiral Sims was assigned as the president of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island in February 1917. Just before the U.S. entered the war, the Wilson administration sent him to London as the senior naval representative. After the U.S. entry in April 1917, Sims was given command over U.S. naval forces operating from Britain. He received a temporary promotion (brevet) to vice admiral in May 1917.

The major threat he faced was a highly effective German submarine campaign against freighters bringing vital food and munitions to the Allies. The combined Anglo-American naval war against U-boats in the western approaches to the British Isles in 1917–18 was a success due to the ability of Sims to work smoothly with his British counterpart, Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly.

Sims believed the Navy Department in Washington, which was effectively headed by Assistant Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt, was failing to provide him with sufficient authority, information, autonomy, manpower, and naval forces.

He ended the war as a vice admiral, in command of all U.S. naval forces operating in Europe. Shortly after the Armistice, Sims was promoted to temporary admiral in December 1918 but reverted to his permanent rank of rear admiral in April 1919 when he was assigned as president of the Naval War College.

===Attack on Daniels===
In 1919 after the war ended in Allied victory, Sims publicly attacked the deficiencies of American naval strategy, tactics, policy, and administration. He charged the failures had cost the Allies 2,500,000 tons of supplies, thereby prolonging the war by six months. He estimated the delay had raised the cost of the war to the Allies by $15 billion, and that it led to the unnecessary loss of 500,000 lives. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels was more of a politician than a naval strategist, so he ably countered the accusations. He pointed to Sims&#x27; anglophilism, and said his vantage point in London was too narrow to assess accurately the overall war effort by the U.S. Navy. Daniels cited prewar naval preparations and strategy proposals made by other American leaders during the war to disprove Sims&#x27; charges.

Despite the public acrimony, Sims emerged with his reputation unharmed, although some historians believe it cost him promotion to the rank of Admiral of the Navy. He did however serve a second tour as president of the Naval War College (1919–1922). It was during his time at the Naval War College that he wrote and published his book &quot;The Victory at Sea&quot; which describes his experiences in World War I. In 1921 &quot;The Victory at Sea&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for History. Sims is, possibly, the only career naval officer to win a Pulitzer Prize. (Rear Admiral Samuel E. Morison won two Pulitzer Prizes but only served nine years in the Naval Reserve.)

==Retirement and death==

Sims retired from the Navy in October 1922, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 64. In retirement he lived at 73 Catherine Street in Newport, Rhode Island. He appeared on the cover of the October 26, 1925 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and was the subject of a feature article. He was promoted to full admiral on the retired list in 1930.

Admiral Sims died in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1936 at the age of 77. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Sims married Anne Erwin Hitchcock, who was sixteen years his junior, in 1905. The couple had five children, three daughters (Margaret, Adelaide and Anne) and two sons (William S. Sims, Jr. and Ethan Sims). Mrs. Sims died in 1960 at age 85.

==Awards==
His account of the U.S. naval effort during World War I, &quot;The Victory at Sea&quot;, won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for History. In 1929 was honored with a Doctor of Laws from Bates College.

Columbia University conferred the honorary degree of doctor of laws upon Rear Admiral Sims on 2 June 1920. Several weeks later, Williams College conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of laws during its June 21, 1920, commencement exercises.

Four U.S. Navy vessels have been named for Sims. Two ships have been named —the World War II-era destroyer and destroyer escort . A transport vessel was named . Additionally the was commissioned in 1970 and decommissioned in 1991.

The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp panel on February 4, 2010. One of the stamps depicted Admiral Sims.

In 1947, the Naval War College acquired an existing barracks building, which they converted to a secondary war-gaming facility, naming it Sims Hall after its former president.

<doc id="934951" wikidata="Q281873" url="?curid=934951" title="Modruš-Rijeka County">
<text>The Modruš-Rijeka County (; ) was a historic administrative subdivision () of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Croatia-Slavonia was an autonomous kingdom within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Transleithania), the Hungarian part of the dual Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its territory is now in western Croatia. Modruš is a small town near Ogulin; Rijeka (then officially Fiume) is a large city on the Adriatic coast. However, Rijeka was not part of the Modruš-Rijeka County, but under the direct administration of Hungary. The capital of the county was Ogulin.

==Geography==
The Modruš-Rijeka County shared borders with the Austrian (Cisleithanian) lands of Istria (part of the Austrian Littoral) and Carniola, the Austro-Hungarian condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Croatian-Slavonian counties of Zagreb and Lika-Krbava and the city/ of Fiume. The county had a strip of Adriatic Sea coast. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
Most of the territory of the county was part of the Kingdom of Croatia when it entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1102, and with it became part of the Habsburg monarchy in 1526. The southern part of the later county around Ogulin was part of the Croatian Military Frontier established in 1553.

From 1466 until the late 18th century Rijeka (under the German name Sankt Veit am Flaum or the Italian and Hungarian name Fiume) was part of the Habsburg , forming part of Inner Austria. In 1776 it was transferred to Croatia, then in 1779 was subordinated directly to the Hungarian Crown as a , i.e. it became a formally separate entity, part of neither Croatia nor Hungary-proper.

The area became part of the Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces in 1809. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna the area was reincorporated into the Austrian Empire: the southern part returned to the Military Frontier; the northern part (the former French province) briefly remained with the newly-established Kingdom of Illyria, then was restored to Croatia, forming part of Zagreb County, while the Fiume was restored to its previous status as well as being the centre of the Croatian Littoral district.

In the decade following the 1848 revolutions Fiume formed part of the autonomous Kingdom of Croatia, becoming the seat of the new Fiume/Rijeka County. The period of absolutism came to an end in October 1860 and with it Fiume was restored to its previous status.
Following the Compromise of 1867 which transformed the Austrian Empire into Austria-Hungary, Fiume remained a within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Transleithania), although its status was disputed by Croatia-Slavonia until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. Between 1871 and 1881 the Military Frontier was disbanded and the counties of Croatia-Slavonia were re-organised. Ogulin-Slunj County was formed from the merger of the former districts of the Ogulin (III) and Slunj (IV) regiments.

By 1886 the counties of Croatia-Slavonia had taken their final form. Modruš-Rijeka County was formed from Rijeka County, the bulk of Ogulin-Slunj County and an area around Severin na Kupi and Bosiljevo formerly belonging to Zagreb County. The south-western-most parts of Ogulin-Slunj County around Senj, Brinje and Krivi Put became the Brinje district and part of the Senj district of Lika-Krbava County while the former exclaves of the Slunj Regiment were transferred to Zagreb County.

In October 1918 Croatia-Slavonia seceded from Austria-Hungary as part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which merged with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia) that December; this was formally recognised in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. In 1922 the Vidovdan Constitution came into force, replacing the Austro-Hungarian counties (and Serbian districts) with oblasts, thereby ending the existence of Modruš-Rijeka County.

Since 1991, when Croatia became independent from Yugoslavia, the county&#x27;s former territory has been part of Croatia.

<text>Wewak is the capital of the East Sepik province of Papua New Guinea. It is on the northern coast of the island of New Guinea. It is the largest town between Madang and Jayapura. It is the see city (seat) of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wewak.

==History==
Between 1943 and 1945, in World War II, Wewak was the site of the largest Japanese airbase in mainland New Guinea. The base was subjected to repeated bombing by Australian and American forces, most notably in one massive attack on 17 August 1943. Directly to the west of the town centre is a peninsula known as Cape Wom, which was the site of the surrender of Japanese forces in New Guinea on 13 September 1945. The site now houses a small memorial. The former Japanese airfield is still in use as the Wewak International Airport. 
In August 1945 two war crimes trials were held near Wewak for mutilation and cannibalism. First Lieutenant Takehiro Tazaki was convicted and sentenced to death (later commuted to 5 years imprisonment with hard labour) and another accused was acquitted.

==Geography==
The old centre of the town is on a small peninsula, with the rest of the urban area occupying a narrow band of flat land between the ocean and the coastal range of mountains that emerges a short distance inland.

To the east of the town center is a small peninsula on which is located Boram Hospital, and Wewak International Airport, which is also known as Boram.

Wewak is linked by road to three villages on the Sepik River: Angoram, Timbunke, and Pagwi, though the roads are not always in good condition. Also, a coastal highway extends to the west, linking Wewak with the coastal towns of Aitape and Vanimo, which is the capital of Sandaun province.

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as tropical rainforest (&quot;Af&quot;).

<doc id="934967" wikidata="Q670113" url="?curid=934967" title="Fixed-base operator">
<text>A fixed-base operator (FBO) is an organization granted the right by an airport to operate at the airport and provide aeronautical services such as fueling, hangaring, tie-down, and parking, aircraft rental, aircraft maintenance, flight instruction, and similar services. In common practice, an FBO is the primary provider of support services to general aviation operators at a public-use airport and is on land leased from the airport, or, in rare cases, adjacent property as a &quot;through the fence operation&quot;. In many smaller airports serving general aviation in remote or modest communities, the town itself may provide fuel services and operate a basic FBO facility. Most FBOs doing business at airports of high to moderate traffic volume are non-governmental organizations, either privately or publicly held companies.

Though the term &quot;fixed-base operator&quot; originated in the United States, the term has become more common in the international aviation industry as business and corporate aviation has grown. The term has not been officially defined as an international standard, but there have been recent uses of the term in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) publications such as &quot;Implementing the Global Aviation Safety Roadmap&quot;.

==History of the term==
After the end of World War I in November 1918, civil aviation in the United States was primarily unregulated and made up of &quot;barnstormers,&quot; transient pilots flying inexpensive military surplus aircraft from city to city and often landing in farm fields on the outskirts of a town because airports were scarce at that time. The traveling aviators offered airplane rides and aerobatic flight demonstrations frequently collaborating as &quot;flying circuses&quot; by performing impromptu airshows for the townsfolk and charging whatever the local economic conditions would allow. As a result, mechanics and early flight instructors moved around with the aircraft and had no established business in any location.

With passage of the Air Commerce Act of 1926 and its resulting requirements for the licensing of pilots, aircraft maintenance requirements, and regulations in training standards, the transient nature of civil aviation was curtailed. The pilots and mechanics who made their living on the road began establishing permanent businesses at the growing number of airports appearing throughout the United States. These were termed fixed-base operations to distinguish them from the transient businesses that had been common prior to 1926.

==Services offered==

Fixed-base operators support a wide range of aeronautical activities which may include one or more of the following:
* Sale of aviation fuel – piston aircraft fuel (avgas) and/or turbine aircraft fuel (Jet-A or Jet A-1)
* Line services for general aviation aircraft
* Air taxi and air charter operations
* Scheduled or nonscheduled air carrier services and support services
* Pilot training
* Aircraft rental and sightseeing
* Aircraft sales and service
* Aircraft storage (tie-down or hangar)
* Repair and aircraft maintenance
* Sale of aircraft parts
* Aerial photography
* Crop dusting and aerial applications
* Aerial advertising and aerial survey

Though not required, fixed-base operators generally also provide at least basic auxiliary services to pilots, flight crew, and passengers such as restroom facilities, telecommunication services, and waiting areas. General aviation FBOs (commonly in the U.S.) sometimes provide &quot;courtesy cars&quot; that can be used for free or little cost by flight crews mostly for short trips from the airport and the surrounding city area. Larger and better equipped FBOs may additionally offer food vending and restaurant facilities, ground transportation arrangements by taxi/limousine, shuttle van, flight planning and weather information areas (computer- or telephone-based), rest lounges and showers, aviation supplies shop (selling navigation charts, manuals, or in-flight comfort items), access to in-flight catering, and accommodations reservations or concierge services for both crew and passengers through a customer service representative (CSR).

==Around the world==
===Canada===
At medium and large airports, FBOs are typically affiliated with one of the major aviation fuel suppliers and display the fuel supplier&#x27;s sign prominently. At smaller airports, the FBO is often the airport operator, such as Alpha Aviation at Boundary bay Airport (CZBB) or a flying club.

=== United States ===
Within the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates some activities that may comprise an FBO such as the authorization of repair stations, flight training, and air taxi/air carrier services. However, there are no federal regulatory standards covering all FBOs. The FAA has defined an FBO as &quot;a commercial entity providing aeronautical services such as fueling, maintenance, storage, ground and flight instruction, etc., to the public.&quot;

The United States Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the FAA, has the duty of establishing minimum standards for commercial aeronautical activities and recommends implementation of these standards by the airport operator or agency, commonly referred to as the airport sponsor. The United States FBO Industry is represented nationally by the National Air Transportation Association or NATA, but is also partly represented by both the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA).

The number of U.S. businesses meeting the minimum criteria as an FBO is 3,138 as of April 2009 according to a survey conducted by Aviation Resource Group International (ARGI). The number has decreased since the 2006 survey, which counted 3,346 FBOs.

<text>Croxley Green is both a village and a suburb of Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, England. It is also a civil parish. Located on the A412 between Watford to the north-east and Rickmansworth to the south-west, it is approximately north-west of central London.

Croxley Green has changed considerably in the years since John Dickinson built paper mills in the area. The area has grown into a semi-urban community, thanks to Croxley tube station on the Metropolitan line providing connections to London&#x27;s West End at Baker Street and stations through to the City at Aldgate.

The population at the 2011 Census was 12,562. Croxley Green is a part of the UK Parliament constituency, South West Hertfordshire. Gagan Mohindra is the Member of Parliament since the December 2019 United Kingdom general election.

==History==
Croxley Green has a large village green.

In 1830, John Dickinson built Croxley Mill adjacent to the Grand Junction Canal, since 1929 part of the Grand Union Canal. John Dickinson Stationery produced &quot;Croxley Script&quot;. Dickinson Square and Dickinson Avenue are named after the paper mill owner and contain houses built by the company for their workers at the end of the 19th century. The mill closed in 1980.

Croxley Green was historically part of the parish of Rickmansworth, which was included in the Watford Poor Law Union from 1835. When sanitary districts were created in 1872, the parish of Rickmansworth, including Croxley Green, therefore became part of the Watford Rural Sanitary District, which in turn became Watford Rural District in 1894.

Croxley Green became part of Rickmansworth Urban District on its creation on 15 April 1898. On 1 April 1974, the urban district was abolished and the village became part of the Three Rivers District. The civil parish of Croxley Green was created on 1 April 1986, covering the eastern part of the former Rickmansworth Urban District and an adjoining area transferred from the parish of Sarratt.

===York House School===
York House School is an independent preparatory day school for girls and boys aged from 3 to 13 years of age, located on Sarratt Road near Croxley Green in Redhead, an eighteenth-century mansion. The current features date variously from 1712, 1743 and 1866.

The school was founded in Hampstead in 1910 by Rev. Cambridge Victor Hawkins. It relocated to Rickmansworth in the late 1940s, then moved again to its current location in 1966. The school motto is &quot;Aut Viam Inveniam Aut Faciam&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;Either I shall find a way or I shall make one&quot;. The school&#x27;s alumni are referred to as Old Yorkists.

<text>70 Ophiuchi is a binary star system located 16.6 light years away from the Earth. It is in the constellation Ophiuchus. At magnitude 4 it appears as a dim star visible to the unaided eye away from city lights.

==History==
In Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd-century Almagest star catalogue this star system is listed as a 4th magnitude star, the &quot;28th&quot; (or &quot;4th outside the constellation figure&quot;) in &quot;Ophiuchus&quot;. It is star &quot;No. 261&quot; in this catalogue.

This star system was first catalogued as a binary star by William Herschel in the late 18th century in his study of binary stars. Herschel proved that this system is a gravitationally bound binary system where the two stars orbit around a common center of mass. This was an important contribution to the proof that Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation applied to objects beyond the Solar System. 

This star was once considered part of the obsolete constellation Taurus Poniatovii, but after the International Astronomical Union officially recognized constellations, it was placed in Ophiuchus.

==Variability==

70 Ophiuchi is a variable star with a magnitude range for the two stars combined of 4.00 to 4.03. The type of variability is uncertain and it is not clear which of the two components causes the variations. It has been suspected of being either a BY Draconis variable or an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, and a period of 1.92396 days has been measured.

==Binary star==
The primary star is a yellow-orange main sequence dwarf of spectral type K0, while the secondary is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4. The two stars orbit each other at an average distance of 23.2 AU. But since the orbit is highly elliptical (at &quot;e&quot;=0.499), the separation between the two varies from 11.4 to 34.8 AU, with one orbit taking 88.38 years to complete.

==Claims of a planetary system==
In 1855, William Stephen Jacob of the Madras Observatory claimed that the orbit of the binary showed an anomaly, and it was &quot;highly probable&quot; that there was a &quot;planetary body in connection with this system&quot;. This is the first known attempt to use astrometric methods to detect an exoplanet, although Friedrich Bessel had applied similar methods 10 years earlier to deduce the existence of Sirius B.

T. J. J. See made a stronger claim for the existence of a dark companion in this system in 1899, but Forest Ray Moulton soon published a paper proving that a three-body system with the specified orbital parameters would be highly unstable. The claims by Jacob and See have both been shown to be erroneous.

Discovery of a &quot;third dark companion&quot; was announced by Louis Berman in 1932. This &quot;dark body&quot; around 70 Oph A was thought to have an 18-year period and a mass of 0.1 to 0.2 the Sun&#x27;s mass. A claim of a planetary system was again made, this time by Dirk Reuyl and Erik Holberg in 1943. The companion was estimated to have a mass 0.008 to 0.012 that of the Sun and a 17-year period. This caused quite a sensation at the time but later observations have gradually discredited this claim.

The negative results of past studies does not completely rule out the possibility of planets. In 2006 a McDonald Observatory team set limits to the presence of one or more planets around 70 Ophiuchi with masses between 0.46 and 12.8 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 AU.

<text>Požega County (; ) was a historic administrative subdivision (&quot;županija&quot;) of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Croatia-Slavonia was an autonomous kingdom within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Transleithania), the Hungarian part of the dual Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its territory is now in eastern Croatia. The capital of the county was Požega (Croatian, in Hungarian: &quot;Pozsega&quot;).

==Geography==
Požega county shared borders with the Austrian land Bosnia-Herzegovina and the counties of Zagreb, Bjelovar-Križevci, Virovitica and Srijem (all in Croatia-Slavonia). The county stretched along the left (northern) bank of the river Sava. Its area was 4933 km2 around 1910.

==History==
The territory of Požega County was part of the Kingdom of Croatia, a realm in personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary since 1102. Požega County was likely formed in the 12th century through partition of the Baranya County. The earliest historical record of Požega County as the &quot;comitatus de Posega&quot; survives from the a deed issued by king Andrew II of Hungary in 1210, confirming ownership of land left to the Knights Templar by the Palatine of Hungary Csépán Győr. The earliest surviving dated mention of the city of Požega (as &quot;castrum de Posega&quot;) dates to 11 January 1227 in a document issued by Pope Honorius III. The pope confirmed the decision of Andrew II granting the Archbishop of Kalocsa Ugrin Csák authority over Požega.

In 1232, Ugrin established a Cistercian abbey in Gotó (also referred to as the &quot;Honesta Vallis&quot;) in present-day Kutjevo where monks first arrived from Zirc Abbey. In the 12th century, Benedictine Rudina Abbey was established in the west of the valley containing the county seat by Ban Borić or one of his sons. According to historian Nada Klaić, Borić owned estates in the area, including the Orljava Fortress, at the time and was likely the first &quot;comes&quot; (appointed head) of Požega County. The Franciscans established an abbey in Požega itself in the second half of the 13th century. Since at least 1217, the Požega Capitulum of St. Peter (&quot;Požeški kaptol sv. Petra&quot;) was established as the place of authentication in present-day Kaptol likely by Ban of Croatia and Bishop of Pécs Kalán.

Ugrin died in the Battle of Mohi in 1241. Then, the title of county &quot;comes&quot; was awarded to Klet Kórógyi. He was killed the same year in battle with Mongols at the Orljava Fortress (near present-day Orljavac). The city of Požega was nonetheless held, and king Béla IV left ruling of Požega to his wife Maria Laskarina who ruled it for the rest of her life, until 1270. In the same period, it was recorded that the county &quot;comes&quot; is Philip, appointed judge by queen Maria in 1244–1266. Béla IV was succeeded by his son Stephen V who died two years later. His wife, queen consort Elizabeth the Cuman moved to Požega in 1272.

In 1293, three years after Elizabeth the Cuman died, Ugrin III Csák was granted the title of the &quot;comes&quot; of Požega County. In 1297, king Andrew III appointed his uncle and member of the Venetian noble Morosini family, Albertino Morosini the &quot;comes&quot; of the Požega County and the Duke of Slavonia. The king&#x27;s mother Tomasina Morosini also stayed in Požega for an extended period, blocking Ugrin III&#x27;s rule over Požega County. The Morosini&#x27;s appointment led the Croatian nobility to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 where he convinced Charles II of Naples to send his grandson Charles Robert to Hungary to claim the throne in person, setting up the dynastic struggle between the Capetian House of Anjou and the Árpád dynasty. After landing at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300, Paul Šubić escorted Charles Robert to Zagreb, where Ugrin III swore loyalty to Charles, who then granted him Požega Castle. When Andrew III died in 1301, the Árpád dynasty became extinct and Ugrin III successfully claimed Požega County as his domain by 1303 – along with Syrmia, Vuka, and Bács counties – and until his death in 1311. In early 14th century, Dujam II Frankopan became the &quot;comes&quot; of Požega County as the supporter of Charles Robert.

In 1385, king Louis I summoned Tvrtko I of Bosnia to Požega where he turned over the western parts of Zachumlia to Louis I as dowry for his marriage with Elizabeth of Bosnia. Following the death of Louis I, Požega was the venue of an inconclusive meeting of supporters and opponents of Elizabeth&#x27;s daughter, queen Mary with the two queens. The Hungarian and Croatian nobility largely objected to any possibility of succession in the female line and supported the claim to the throne by Charles III of Naples as the last surviving male member of the Capetian branch of the Anjou family.

In 1409, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, having prevailed in the fight for the Hungarian crown, gave Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, in return for his support in dynastic struggle for the Hungarian throne with the Capetian House of Anjou, various estates and titles including the city of Požega and appointed him the &quot;comes&quot; of the Požega County. The decision was reversed in 1413 when he fell out of the king&#x27;s favour. In 1432–1437, Ladislaus Tamási was the &quot;comes&quot; of Požega County. His son Henrik held the same office in 1443 and 1444 – when he also held equivalent posts in Virovitica and Somogy counties. In 1445–1447, the position of &quot;comes&quot; of Požega County (along with possession of the &quot;castrum&quot; and patronage of the Rudina abbey) was granted by the royal court to Palatine Lőrinc Hédervári. He was succeeded by his son Henrik, the Duke of Macsó. Henrik was the &quot;comes&quot; of Požega County in 1447–1450 and 1464–1472. The late 15th century and the early 16th century saw the first incursions of the Ottoman Empire in the Požega County. Periods of fighting were broken with stable periods of peacetime, each associated with a powerful &quot;comes&quot; of the county. Those were the Ladislaus of Ilok, Lawrence of Ilok, and Franjo Dessewffy.

By the time of 1527 election in Cetin and the start of rule of the House of Habsburg, the Požega County became defunct as only three Croatian counties remained due to territorial losses to the Ottoman Empire – Zagreb, Varaždin, and counties. Namely, the territory of the county was lost to the Ottoman conquests during the Hundred Years&#x27; Croatian–Ottoman War, and the city of Požega was captured by the Ottomans in 1537. The Požega County was re-established in 1745 after Ottoman territorial gains in the area were reversed during the Ottoman–Habsburg wars. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon the county became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). Since 1991, when Croatia became independent from Yugoslavia, the county is part of Croatia.

<doc id="934981" wikidata="Q311489" url="?curid=934981" title="Sigma Draconis">
<text>Sigma Draconis is a single star in the northern constellation of Draco. It has the proper name Alsafi , while Sigma Draconis, which is latinised from σ Draconis and abbreviated Sig Dra or σ Dra, is the Bayer designation. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.7, which is bright enough to be faintly visible to the naked eye. Based on parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of 18.8 light years from the Sun. It is receding from the Sun with a radial velocity of 26.6 km/s.

==Name==

&quot;σ Draconis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Sigma Draconis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation, established in 1603 as part of the &quot;Uranometria&quot;, a star catalogue produced by German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer.

It bore the traditional name &quot;Alsafi&quot;, derived from the Arabic &quot;Athāfi&quot;, itself erroneously transcribed from the Arabic plural &quot;Athāfiyy&quot;, by which the nomads designated the tripods of their open-air kitchens. It was the name of an association of this star, Tau Draconis and Upsilon Draconis. According to a 1971 NASA memorandum, &quot;Athāfi&quot; or &quot;Alsafi&quot; were the title for three stars: Sigma Draconis as &quot;Alsafi&quot;, Tau Draconis as &quot;Athāfi I&quot; and Upsilon Draconis as &quot;Athāfi II&quot;. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Alsafi&quot; for Sigma Draconis on 30 June 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Celestial Kitchen&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Sigma Draconis, Delta Draconis, Epsilon Draconis, Rho Draconis, 64 Draconis (see 64 Draconis (Portuguese)) and Pi Draconis. Consequently, the Chinese name for Sigma Draconis itself is (, .)

==Properties==

Sigma Draconis is a main sequence dwarf which has long served as a K0 V spectral standard star. Its classification as K0 V defines one of the anchor points of the Morgan–Keenan system that have remained unchanged since the original 1943 MKK Atlas. However, some modern spectroscopy gives it as designation of G9 V.

The radius of Sigma Draconis has been directly measured using interferometry with the CHARA array, which yields a result of 77.6% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. It has 84% of the Sun&#x27;s mass, but the luminosity of this star is only 42% that of the Sun. The projected rotation rate (&quot;v&quot; sin &quot;i&quot;) is relatively low at 1.4 km/s. It is considered a slightly metal-poor star, meaning that it has a lower proportion of elements with masses greater than helium when compared to the Sun.

The temperature, luminosity and surface activity appear to vary slightly in a manner very similar to the sunspot cycle, with a changing duration of 5 to 7 years. The total variability is among the lowest of all stars that have been measured by the Hipparcos spacecraft. 

Sigma Draconis has a high proper motion, advancing across the celestial sphere at a rate of 1.835 arc seconds per year. The star made its perihelion passage about 46,300 years ago, when it came within . The components of Sigma Draconis&#x27;s space velocity are U=+36, V=+40, and W=−10 km/s. This gives the star an unusually large orbital eccentricity about the Milky Way galaxy of 0.30 (compared to 0.06 for the Sun.) The mean galactocentric distance for the orbit is 10.3 kiloparsecs (about 34,000 light-years).

As of 2013, no Jupiter-size or larger companion had been detected about the star and there was no indication of excess infrared radiation that would be evidence of circumstellar matter (such as a debris disk).

== Search for planets ==

Between 2004 and 2013, extensive radial velocity measurements were gathered on Sigma Draconis using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the Keck Observatory. The Keck/HIRES data indicated a possible period of about 300 days and a likely alias period of 2,800 days. Adding data taken with the Automated Planet Finder at the Lick Observatory strengthened and narrowed the 300-day period while reducing the significance of the 2,800-day period. The combined analysis suggests there may be a Uranus-mass planet on a 308-day orbit, though the authors do not yet consider the discovery to be publishable as they have not yet attempted to rule out other non-planetary explanations for the velocity variations.

A 2017 study also using Keck/HIRES data did not find evidence of a planet; while a signal with a 2,600-day period was found, it was attributed to the star&#x27;s magnetic activity cycle.

<doc id="934982" wikidata="Q541952" url="?curid=934982" title="Marcelo Balboa">
<text>Marcelo Balboa (born August 8, 1967) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a defender in the 1990s for the United States national team, becoming its captain. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

After retiring from playing, he has worked as a commentator for ESPN and ABC and MLS games on HDNet and Altitude, as well as FIFA World Cup games on Univision. He is the head boys&#x27; soccer coach for Monarch High School in Louisville, Colorado,

==Club career==

===Youth===
Balboa, who is of Argentine descent, was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Cerritos, California. Balboa played youth soccer for Fram-Culver, which won the 1986 McGuire Cup (U-19 National Championship). Balboa&#x27;s father, Luis Balboa who played professionally in Argentina and with the Chicago Mustangs of the North American Soccer League, coached him. In 1985, Balboa graduated from Cerritos High School.

Balboa attended Cerritos College, a local two-year community college from 1986 to 1987. At Cerritos, Balboa was both placekicker on the football team and a two-time 1st Team All-South Coast Conference soccer player. Cerritos College has retired Balboa&#x27;s jersey number – #3. In 1988, Balboa transferred to San Diego State University where he was a 1988 First Team and a 1989 Second Team All American soccer player.

===Professional===
From 1987 to 1989, Balboa played the collegiate off-seasons on an amateur contract with the professional San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer League. He was the 1988 WSA MVP. In 1990, Balboa began his professional career with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the American Professional Soccer League. In 1992, he moved to the Colorado Foxes. He played for León in the Mexican League in 1995 and 1996.

In 1996, Balboa signed with Major League Soccer and the Colorado Rapids. Balboa played six seasons for the Rapids, leading as the team&#x27;s all-time leader in many statistical categories. Traded to the MetroStars in 2002, he played only five minutes all year, sitting out the rest with injuries, and retiring afterwards.

Balboa ended his MLS career with 24 goals and 23 assists in 152 games. In 2005, Balboa was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI and elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame on the first ballot along with Nick Folan. In 2012, he was inducted into the Colorado Hall of Fame.

A goal by Balboa for the Rapids in 2000 against the Columbus Crew was named the MLS Goal of the Year for that season.

==International career==
Balboa earned his first cap with United States national team on January 10, 1988, against Guatemala. He anchored the American defense in the 1990 and the 1994 FIFA World Cups, in the latter receiving international attention for his near miss with a bicycle kick in the United States&#x27; win over Colombia. He was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year in 1992 and 1994. In 1995, he became the first United States player to break the 100-cap barrier. In 1998, he joined Tab Ramos and Eric Wynalda as the first United States players to play in three World Cups. Balboa ended his United States career with 128 caps and 13 goals, and his final appearance came in a friendly against Iran on January 16, 2000.

==Post-retirement ==

===Team executive===
After the 2004 MLS season, Balboa assumed a front office position with the Rapids.

===Broadcaster===
Balboa debuted as a sideline reporter during ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 2003 MLS All-Star Game and MLS Cup. In 2004, he became a regular announcer for ABC and ESPN&#x27;s television coverage of the United States national team. Most recently, Balboa has paired up with baseball announcer Dave O&#x27;Brien as networks&#x27; #1 U.S. announcing team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

In 2007, Balboa started a soccer radio show, &quot;From The Pitch&quot;, which airs on Denver station Mile High Sports Radio. Balboa served as an analyst for NBC Sports coverage of Soccer at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He has been a guest soccer analyst on Telefutura&#x27;s &quot;Contacto Deportivo&quot;.

In 2014, he was commentator of the United States team matches for Univision at the World Cup in Brazil.

===Coaching===
In 2012, Monarch High School hired Balboa to coach the boys&#x27; soccer team.

==Personal life==
Balboa, who is the son of Argentine immigrants, resides in the town of Superior, Colorado.

<text>Rustavi ( ) is a city in the southeast of Georgia, in the region of Kvemo Kartli and southeast of capital Tbilisi. It has a population of 127,154 (January 2024), making it the fourth most populous city in Georgia. Its economy is dominated by the Rustavi Metallurgical Plant.

==History==
Rustavi is one of the ancient towns of Georgia. The history of Rustavi has two phases: an early history from ancient times until the city was destroyed in the 13th century and modern history from the Soviet era to the present.

===Early history===
The 11th-century Georgian chronicler, Leonti Mroveli in his work &quot;&quot;Georgian Chronicles&quot; connects the foundation of the city to Kartlos, the eponymous ancestor of Georgians, whose wife had founded a town along the Kura river called Bostan-Kalaki (lit. &quot;city of gardens&quot;&quot;). The same chronicler, who also worked on “&quot;The life of the Kings&quot;”, mentions the town Rustavi among those castles, which opposed Alexander the Great&#x27;s army, although it is proved that Alexander had never invaded Iberia. Rustavi is mentioned among such ancient towns as Uplistsikhe, Urbnisi, Mtskheta and Sarkineti. It could be assumed that Rustavi as a city had been founded at least in the 5th–4th centuries B.C. Besides the manuscripts, the excavations of the castle Rustavi prove that Rustavi was an important political and administrative center of Iberia. In late 4th century A.D Trdat of Iberia had built a church and a canal in Rustavi.

During the reign of Vakhtang I of Iberia (5th century) Rustavi took an important part in the political life of the Kingdom of Iberia. At the beginning of the 6th century, in 503, the Sassanids conquered Iberia and turned it into an ordinary Persian province ruled by a &quot;marzpan&quot; (governor). However, Byzantine Emperor Heraclius&#x27;s offensive in 627 and 628 brought final victory over the Persians and ensured Byzantine predominance in Georgia, until the invasion of the Arabs. In the struggle against Arab occupation Rustavi belonged to the Principality of Kakheti, the latter would form the Kakhetian kingdom, whose ruler Kvirike III the Great, installed an Eristavi (duke) in Rustavi. On Kvirike&#x27;s death, Kakheti was temporarily annexed to the Kingdom of Georgia. As soon as the Arabs were defeated, in 1068 Georgia was invaded by the resurgent Turk-Seljuks from Central Asia, under the command of Sultan Alp Arslan. There was a terrible battle between king Bagrat IV of Georgia and the Seljuks, where Bagrat was bitterly defeated and as a result, the king of Kakheti gained independence developing closer contact with the Turkish-Seljuks and securing independence in this way. After the Seljukid invasions of Georgia, allied forces took Tbilisi and Rustavi and gave it to the Emir of Tbilisi. During that time Rustavi declined, its economy was ruined, and due to its strategic location it only remained as a well-fortified town in the hands of the emirs in Tbilisi. In 1069 Bagrat IV defeated emir Fadlun and captured the fortress of Rustavi, Partskhisi, and Agarani. During the anti-Seljuk campaigns led by David IV Rustavi played an essential role in securing Georgia&#x27;s southern boundaries. Rustavi was finally destroyed after Timur&#x27;s invasion of Georgia.

===Modern history===
Rustavi was rebuilt as a major industrial center during the Soviet era. The development of Rustavi was part of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s accelerated industrialization process, and included ironworks, steelworks, chemical plants and an important railway station on the Tbilisi–Baku railroad line. Rustavi is the site of approximately 90 large and medium-sized industrial plants.

The core of the city&#x27;s industrial activity was the Rustavi Metallurgical Plant, constructed in 1941–1950 to process iron ore from nearby Azerbaijan. Stalin brought workers from various regions in Georgia, specifically from the poorer rural provinces of Western Georgia. Rustavi became a key industrial center for the Transcaucasus region. The industrial activity expanded to include the manufacture of steel products, cement, chemicals, and synthetic fibers.

May 1944 was a significant time in the history of modern Rustavi. Geologists began to define the soil of the place where the metallurgical works were to be built. The area was nearly empty, and there were only temporary lodgings and slums available. Many people arrived at Rustavi, coming from different parts of Georgia. The first newspaper came out on 30 August 1944. It was called “Metallurgiisatvis” (meaning &quot;For Metallurgy&quot; in Georgian).

Rustavi celebrated frequent housewarming parties as many people migrated to the city each day. In 1948 the first streets were “baptized” in Rustavi. The first street was named after the Young Communist League, the second, after the builders of Rustavi, and the third, after its ancient name Bostan-Kalaki.

On 19 January 1948, a decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic declared Rustavi a town of republican importance. On 27 April 1950, the whole town celebrated the production of the first industrial Georgian steel. The theme of the celebration was dedicated to an ancient people whom are believed to have originally settled the area, known as the Khalibs.

German POWs who were captured in World War II were enlisted to build the city of Rustavi. Modern Rustavi is divided into two parts—&quot;Dzveli Rustavi&quot; (Old Rustavi) and &quot;Akhali Rustavi&quot; (New Rustavi). Old Rustavi adheres to Stalinist architectural style while New Rustavi is dominated by a multitude of Soviet-era block apartments. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 proved disastrous for Rustavi, as it also caused the collapse of the integrated Soviet economy of which the city was a key part. Most of its industrial plants were shut down and 65% of the city&#x27;s population became unemployed, with the attendant social problems of high crime and acute poverty that such a situation brings. The population shrank from 160,000 in the mid-1990s to 116,000 in 2002 as residents moved elsewhere in search of work.

New York-based artist Greg Lindquist (b. 1979) has documented Rustavi&#x27;s crumbling concrete factories in his paintings and installations, such as the exhibition &quot;Nonpasts&quot; in 2010. Lindquist has also worked with Georgian collaborators, such as artist Gio Sumbadze (b. 1976), in projects that address the current social, cultural and political significance of these architectures. In 2010, the Laura Palmer Foundation staged an exhibition at the Ministry of Transportation building (Tbilisi Roads Ministry Building) in which Lindquist and Sumbadze installed paintings addressing the history of Georgia&#x27;s transportation system. This BOMB magazine interview with La Toya Frazier for the exhibition &quot;Planet of Slums&quot; addresses many of the complexities of Lindquist&#x27;s work in the Republic of Georgia.

== Demographics ==

At the beginning of 2021, Rustavi had more than 130,072 inhabitants, an increase of 4% since the 2014 census. This increase makes Rustavi the fourth most populous city in Georgia, just behind Kutaisi, which is suffering from ongoing contraction. Rustavi experienced rapid growth due to industrialization under Stalin. Following Georgian independence in 1991, and the years of civil war and crisis that followed, many residents emigrated due to unemployment. The low point was reached around 2002, with growth picking up in the 2010s while industrial activities and employment have resumed. 

In 2014, the ethnic composition of Rustavi was almost 92% Georgian, with minority communities of Azerbaijanis (3.7%), Armenians (1.6%) and Russians (1.2%). More than 500 Ossetians (0.4%) lived in the city. Other ethnic minorities included 315 Ukrainians, 239 Yazidis, 166 Greeks, 55 Assyrians and smaller numbers of Kists, Jews, Abkhazian and Bosha.

The proportions of the ethnic minorities in the city has not always been this way. Especially in the Soviet period these were completely different, with striking numbers of Russians. The city also had a substantial Ossetian community. Migration during and after the fall of the Soviet Union and due to civil conflicts has made the city much more mono-ethnic Georgian.
== City governance ==

Rustavi is a self-governing city. The representative body of the city is the City Council, and the executive body is the City Hall. Administratively, Rustavi is divided into 10 territorial bodies:

<doc id="934990" wikidata="Q7374450" url="?curid=934990" title="RM Chivenor">
<text>Royal Marines Barracks Chivenor is a British military base used primarily by UK Commando Force. It is situated on the northern shore of the River Taw estuary, adjacent to the South West Coast Path, on the north coast of Devon, England. The nearest towns are Barnstaple and Braunton.

Originally a civil airfield opened in the 1930s, the site was taken over by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was operational between May 1940 and 1995 when it was transferred to the Royal Marines.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chivenor&quot; is first attested in 1285, as &quot;Chivenore&quot;. This is thought to originate in Old English as a personal name, &quot;Cifa&quot;, in its genitive form &quot;Cifan&quot;, combined with the Old English word &quot;ōra&quot; (&#x27;flat-topped ridge&#x27;). Thus the name once meant &#x27;Cifa&#x27;s flat-topped ridge&#x27;. The ridge in question runs from west to east along the north bank of the River Taw, from Heanton Punchardon to Tutshill Wood on the northern fringe of Barnstaple. Like Heanton Punchardon, RM Chivenor lies at the west end of the ridge.

== History ==
=== RAF Chivenor ===
In the 1930s, a civil airfield was opened on or near the site of Chivenor farm. In February 1940 the Air Ministry took the site over, constructing an aerodrome in May 1940 for use as a RAF Coastal Command Station. Known as RAF Chivenor, the station opened on 25 October 1940 within No. 17 Group, Coastal Command. Initially, two units were based there initially: No. 3 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit RAF and No. 252 Squadron RAF, both operating Bristol Beaufighters, Bristol Blenheims and Bristol Beauforts.

After the Second World War, the station was largely used for training, particularly weapons training. During the 1950s and 1960s, No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit RAF (229 OCU) used Hawker Hunter aircraft for training. In 1974 229 OCU left for RAF Brawdy (where it was renamed as the Tactical Weapons Unit), with Chivenor placed into &quot;care and maintenance&quot; status for rebuilding, though No. 624 Volunteer Gliding Squadron (624 VGS) continued to fly from there.

The RAF returned in 1981, with 2 Tactical Weapons Unit (2 TWU) and their BAE Hawks, moving in from RAF Lossiemouth. In 1992 2 TWU was renamed as 7 FTS before leaving in 1994 to merge with 4 FTS at RAF Valley, and the airfield was handed over to the RM.

=== Transfer to Royal Marines ===

From 1 October 1995 onwards, the Royal Marines took control of the base, it being renamed Royal Marines Base Chivenor (RMB Chivenor). It became home to the Commando Logistics Regiment, Royal Marines and 59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, now 24 Commando Regiment Royal Engineers.

The airfield remained an operational airfield, used by the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and RAF Search and Rescue Force (No. 22 Squadron RAF) as well as No. 624 Volunteer Gliding Squadron RAF (624 VGS) operating Grob Vigilant T1 motor gliders, providing flights for the Air Training Corps and Combined Cadet Force.

===Proposed closure===
&quot;A Better Defence Estate&quot;, published in November 2016, indicated that the Ministry of Defence would dispose of RMB Chivenor by 2027. However, following a concerted campaign to keep the base open, the Ministry of Defence announced in February 2019 that the base would remain open.

== Based units ==

===Cadets===
In December 2020 the Volunteer Cadet Corps started a unit of Royal Marines Cadets at RMB Chivenor. Due to COVID-19, face to face activities were put on hold but as of October 2021 the first cadets and adult volunteers will be starting training on site.

== Role and operations ==
=== Commando Logistic Regiment ===
The Commando Logistic Regiment&#x27;s role is to ensure the re-supply of ammunition, water, fuel and food, known as &quot;combat supplies&quot; to the ground forces, and to provide first-line medical care to any service person or civilian. It also provides specialist services to sustain the brigade&#x27;s operation.

=== 24 Commando Regiment Royal Engineers ===
Formed in April 2008, 24 Commando Engineer Regiment is a unit of the British Army&#x27;s Royal Engineers which supports 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines.

== RMB Chivenor in the media==
On 21 November 2008 the BBC Top Gear series filmed segments near to Chivenor. In the segments the presenter Jeremy Clarkson takes part in a mock battle on the beach at Instow with around 30 marines from Chivenor and elsewhere.

The Sea Kings from 22 squadron A-Flight at Chivenor took a starring role in Episode 6 of the National Geographic Channel documentary television series Sea Patrol UK, with B-Flight of 22 Squadron at AAC Wattisham alongside Royal Navy and Coastguard units.

The 2011 BBC television series &quot;The Choir: Military Wives&quot; featured Chivenor. The programme documented choirmaster Gareth Malone forming a choir of wives and partners of Chivenor personnel deployed on active service in the Afghanistan War. In forming a choir, Malone aimed to raise the women&#x27;s morale and raise their profile in the public perception. The song &quot;Wherever You Are&quot; was recorded by the Military Wives Choir and was released as a single in December 2011, with proceeds going to the Royal British Legion and SSAFA Forces Help.

<doc id="934991" wikidata="Q150117" url="?curid=934991" title="Body proportions">
<text>Body proportions is the study of artistic anatomy, which attempts to explore the relation of the elements of the human body to each other and to the whole. These ratios are used in depictions of the human figure and may become part of an artistic canon of body proportion within a culture. Academic art of the nineteenth century demanded close adherence to these reference metrics and some artists in the early twentieth century rejected those constraints and consciously mutated them.

==Basics of human proportions==
It is usually important in figure drawing to draw the human figure in proportion. Though there are subtle differences between individuals, human proportions fit within a fairly standard range though artists have historically tried to create idealised standards that have varied considerably over time, according to era and region. In modern figure drawing, the basic unit of measurement is the &#x27;head&#x27;, which is the distance from the top of the head to the chin. This unit of measurement is credited to the Greek sculptor Polykleitos (fifth century BCE) and has long been used by artists to establish the proportions of the human figure. Ancient Egyptian art used a canon of proportion based on the &quot;fist&quot;, measured across the knuckles, with 18 fists from the ground to the hairline on the forehead. This canon was already established by the Narmer Palette from about the 31st century BC, and remained in use until at least the conquest by Alexander the Great some 3,000 years later.

One version of the proportions used in modern figure drawing is:
* An average person is generally 7-and-a-half heads tall (including the head).
* An ideal figure, used when aiming for an impression of nobility or grace, is drawn at 8 heads tall.
* A heroic figure, used in the depiction of gods and superheroes, is eight-and-a-half heads tall. Most of the additional length comes from a bigger chest and longer legs.

===Measurements===

There are a number of important distances between reference points that an artist may measure and will observe: These are the distance from floor to the patella; from the patella to the front iliac crest; the distance across the stomach between the iliac crests; the distances (which may differ according to pose) from the iliac crests to the suprasternal notch between the clavicles; and the distance from the notch to the bases of the ears (which again may differ according to the pose).

Some teachers deprecate mechanistic measurements and strongly advise the artist to learn to estimate proportion by eye alone.
===Ratios===
Many text books of artistic anatomy advise that the head height be used as a for other lengths in the body: their ratios to it provide a consistent and credible structure. Although the average person is 7 heads tall, the custom in Classical Greece (since Lysippos) and Renaissance art was to set the figure as eight heads tall: &quot;the eight-heads-length figure seems by far the best; it gives dignity to the figure and also seems to be the most convenient.&quot; The half-way mark is a line between the greater trochanters, just above the pubic arch.
* the ratio of hip circumference to shoulder circumference varies by biological sex: the average ratio for women is 1:1.03, for men it is 1:1.18.
* legs (floor to crotch, which are typically three-and-a-half to four heads long; arms about three heads long; hands are as long as the face.
* Leg-to-body ratio is seen as indicator of physical attractiveness but there appears to be no accepted definition of leg-length: the &#x27;perineum to floor&#x27; measure is the most used but arguably the distance from ankle bone to outer hip bone is more rigorous. On this (latter) metric, the most attractive ratio of leg to body for men (as seen by American women) is 1:1, matching the ratio above. A Japanese study using the former metric found the same result for male attractiveness but women with longer legs than body were judged to be more attractive. Excessive deviations from the mean were seen as indicative of disease. &quot;High class fashion journals depict women with an extreme length of limb, and decorative art does the same for both men and women [...]. When the artist wishes to depict the lower orders, as such, or the comic, he draws people with exaggeratedly short limbs and makes them fat.&quot;
* Waist-to-height ratio: the average ratio for US college competitive swimmers is 0.424 (women) and 0.428 (men); the ratios for a (US) normally healthy man or woman is 0.460.53 and 0.450.49 respectively; the ratio ranges beyond 0.63 for morbidly obese individuals.
*Waist–hip ratio: artist&#x27;s conception of the ideal waisthip ratio has varied down the ages, but for female figures &quot;over the 2,500-year period the average WHR never exited &#x27;the fertile range&#x27; (from 0.67 to 0.80).&quot; The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; (130100BCE) has a WHR of 0.76; in Anthony van Dyck&#x27;s (1630), Venus&#x27;s estimated WHR is 0.8; and Jean-Léon Gérôme&#x27;s (1890) has an estimated WHR of 0.66.

==Body proportions in history==

The earliest known representations of female figures date from 23,000 to 25,000 years ago. Models of the human head (such as the Venus of Brassempouy) are rare in Paleolithic art: most are like the Venus of Willendorf bodies with vestigial head and limbs, noted for their very high waist:hip ratio of 1:1 or more. It may be that the artists&#x27; &quot;depictions of corpulent, middle-aged females were not &#x27;Venuses&#x27; in any conventional sense. They may, instead, have symbolized the hope for survival and longevity, within well-nourished and reproductively successful communities.&quot;

The ancient Greek sculptor Polykleitos (c.450–420 BCE), known for his ideally proportioned bronze &quot;Doryphoros&quot;, wrote an influential &quot;Canon&quot; (now lost) describing the proportions to be followed in sculpture. The &quot;Canon&quot; applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and &quot;symmetria&quot; (Greek for &quot;harmonious proportions&quot;) creating a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous geometric progressions. Polykleitos may have used the distal phalanx of the little finger as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body, scaling this length up repeatedly by to obtain the ideal size of the other phalanges, the hand, forearm, and upper arm in turn.

Leonardo da Vinci believed that the ideal human proportions were determined by the harmonious proportions that he believed governed the universe, such that the ideal man would fit cleanly into a circle as depicted in his famed drawing of &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; (c. 1492), as described in a book by Vitruvius. Leonardo&#x27;s commentary is about relative body proportions with comparisons of hand, foot, and other feature&#x27;s lengths to other body parts more than to actual measurements.


==Golden ratio==

It has been suggested that the ideal human figure has its navel at the golden ratio (formula_1, about 1.618), dividing the body in the ratio of 0.618 to 0.382 (soles of feet to navel:navel to top of head) ( is , about 0.618) and Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Vitruvian Man is cited as evidence. In reality, the navel of the Vitruvian Man divides the figure at 0.604 and nothing in the accompanying text mentions the golden ratio.

In his conjectural reconstruction of the Canon of Polykleitos, art historian Richard Tobin determined (about 1.4142) to be the important ratio between elements that the classical Greek sculptor had used.

<doc id="934992" wikidata="Q6234976" url="?curid=934992" title="John Gauden">
<text>John Gauden (died 20 September 1662) was an English cleric. He was Bishop of Exeter then Bishop of Worcester. He was also a writer, and the reputed author of the important Royalist work &quot;Eikon Basilike&quot;.

==Life==
He was born at Mayland, Essex, where his father, also named John Gauden, was vicar of the parish, and educated at Bury St Edmunds school and at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1623, M.A. 1626. By his matriculation at Michaelmas 1619, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; gives him a birth year 1599/1600; whereas &quot;A Cambridge Alumni Database&quot; gives 1605. He then moved to Oxford, where he graduated B.D. 1635 (at Wadham College, Oxford), D.D. 1641.

He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Russell of Chippenham, Cambridgeshire, Treasurer of the Navy and his second wife Elizabeth Gerard, and widow of Edward Lewkenor of Denham in Suffolk, and was tutor at Oxford to two of his wife&#x27;s brothers. They had five children, four sons and a daughter. He seems to have remained at Oxford until 1630, when he became vicar of Chippenham. His sympathies were at first with the parliamentary party. He was chaplain to Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, and preached before the House of Commons in 1640.

In 1641 he was appointed to the rural deanery of Bocking. Apparently, his views changed as the revolutionary tendency of the Presbyterian party became more pronounced, for in 1649 he addressed to Lord Fairfax &quot;A Religious and Loyal Protestation... against the proceedings of the parliament&quot;. Under the Commonwealth he faced both ways, keeping his ecclesiastical preferment, but publishing from time to time pamphlets on behalf of the Church of England. While in Bocking he met William Juniper, the &quot;Gosfield Seer&quot; whom he first dismissed as a harmless fool. However, he was later impressed by prophecies made by Juniper, first that the King would be overthrown, and then that the monarchy would be restored.

At the Restoration he was made Bishop of Exeter; he was elected to the See on 3 November 1660, confirmed 17 November, and consecrated a bishop on 2 December 1660. He immediately began to complain to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, of the poverty of the See, and based claims for a better benefice on a certain secret service, which he explained in January 1661 to be the sole invention of the &quot;Eikon Basilike, The Pourtraicture of his sacred Majestie in his Solitudes and Sufferings&quot;, put forth within a few hours after the execution of Charles I as written by the king himself. To which Clarendon replied that he had been before acquainted with the secret and had often wished he had remained ignorant of it. Gauden was advanced in 1662, not as he had wished to the See of Winchester, but to Worcester. He was duly elected to the See of Worcester on 23 May and that election was confirmed on 10 June 1662. He died on 20 September the same year: his enemies said that he had died of chagrin at not getting the see of Winchester. His widow died in 1671: Samuel Pepys, a close friend of John&#x27;s brother Sir Denis Gauden, the Navy Victualler, praised her charm and conversational skills.

==Authorship question==

The evidence in favour of Gauden&#x27;s authorship rests chiefly on his own assertions and those of his wife (who after his death sent to her son John a narrative of the claim), and on the fact that it was admitted by Clarendon, who should have had means of being acquainted with the truth. Gauden&#x27;s letters on the subject are printed in the appendix to vol. iii. of the Clarendon Papers.

The argument is that Gauden had prepared the book to inspire sympathy with the king through a representation of his pious and forgiving disposition, and so to rouse public opinion against his execution. In 1693 further correspondence between Gauden, Clarendon, the Duke of York (later James II &amp; VII), and Sir Edward Nicholas was published by Arthur North, who had found them among the papers of his sister-in-law, a daughter-in-law of Bishop Gauden; but doubt has been thrown on the authenticity of these papers. Gauden stated that he had begun the book in 1647 and was entirely responsible for it. But it is contended that the work was in existence at the Battle of Naseby, and testimony to Charles&#x27;s authorship is brought forward from various witnesses who had seen Charles himself occupied with it at various times during his imprisonment.

It is stated that the MS. was delivered by one of the king&#x27;s agents to Edward Symmons, rector of Raine, near Bocking, and that it was in the handwriting of Oudart, Sir Edward Nicholas&#x27;s secretary. The internal evidence has, as is usual in such cases, been brought forward as a conclusive argument in favour of both contentions.

Doubt was thrown on Charles&#x27;s authorship in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Eikonoklastes&quot; (1649), which was followed almost immediately by a royalist answer, &quot;The Princely Pelican. Royall Resolves Extracted from his Majestys Divine Meditations, with satisfactory reasons that his Sacred Person was the only Author of them&quot; (1649). The history of the whole controversy, which has been several times renewed, was dealt with in Christopher Wordsworth&#x27;s tracts in a most exhaustive way. He eloquently advocated Charles&#x27;s authorship. Since he wrote in 1829, some further evidence has been forthcoming in favour of the Naseby copy.

A correspondence relating to the French translation of the work has also come to light among the papers of Sir Edward Nicholas. None of the letters show any doubt that King Charles was the author. S. R. Gardiner (Hist. of the Great Civil War, iv, 325) regards Charles Doble&#x27;s articles as finally disposing of Charles&#x27;s claim to the authorship, but this is by no means the attitude of other writers.

If Gauden was the author, he may have incorporated papers, &amp;c., by Charles, who may have corrected the work and thus been joint-author. This theory would reconcile the conflicting evidence, that of those who saw Charles writing parts and read the MS. before publication, and the deliberate statements of Gauden.

<doc id="934995" wikidata="Q6390966" url="?curid=934995" title="Kenny Baker (American performer)">
<text>Kenneth Laurence Baker (September 30, 1912 – August 10, 1985) was an American singer and actor who first gained notice as the featured singer on radio&#x27;s &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; during the 1930s.

==Film==
Before he became a star, Baker sang as a member of the Vitaphone chorus at Warner Bros.

At the height of his radio fame, and after leaving the Benny show in 1939 (succeeded by Dennis Day, whose tenor voice was very similar to Baker&#x27;s), he appeared in 17 film musicals, including &quot;Mr. Dodd Takes the Air&quot; (1937), &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; (1946). He also starred in the 1939 movie version of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;. He later co-starred with Mary Martin in the original Broadway production of Kurt Weill and Ogden Nash&#x27;s &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (1943).

==Radio==
Baker first appeared on Jack Benny&#x27;s weekly radio program on November 3, 1935, having been hired to replace singer Frank Parker. Parker had been very popular on the Benny program, and with his departure, it was widely believed that Benny would lose a large part of his audience; however, Kenny Baker is said to have won audiences over almost instantly, even surpassing Parker in popularity. Baker portrayed a high-voiced, innocent young man on the show, who would frequently cause the Jack Benny character frustration with his &quot;silly&quot; remarks.

Baker&#x27;s final regular appearance on Benny&#x27;s radio show aired on June 25, 1939, leaving the $3,000 per week job because he no longer wanted to play the character. He was subsequently replaced by singer Dennis Day. After his four-year stint on the Benny program, Baker returned to radio as a regular performer on Fred Allen&#x27;s &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; program (1940–1942). He was also heard on &quot;Blue Ribbon Town&quot; (1943–1944) and &quot;Glamour Manor&quot; (1945–1947). He had his own programs, the &quot;Kenny Baker Show&quot; (1954) and &quot;SincerelyKenny Baker&quot; (1946). The latter was syndicated by the Frederick W. Ziv Company via electrical transcription.

==Later years==
After retiring from performing in the early 1950s, Baker became a Christian Science practitioner and motivational speaker and recorded a number of record albums of hymns for his church.

==Death==
Baker died of a heart attack in Solvang, California, August 10, 1985, aged 72.

<doc id="934999" wikidata="Q1297837" url="?curid=934999" title="Syrmia County">
<text>Syrmia County (, , , ) was a historic administrative subdivision (&quot;županija&quot;) of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Croatia-Slavonia was an autonomous kingdom within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Transleithania), the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary. The region of Syrmia is today split between Croatia and Serbia. The capital of the county was Vukovar ().

==Geography==
Syrmia County shared borders with other Croatian-Slavonian counties of Požega and Virovitica, the Austro-Hungarian land of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Kingdom of Serbia, and the Hungarian counties of Bács-Bodrog and Torontál. The County stretched along the right (southern) bank of the river Danube and the left (northern) bank of the river Sava, down to their confluence. Its area was 6,866 km² around 1910.

==Background==

By the 13th century, two counties were formed in this region: Syrmia (in the east) and Vukovar (in the west). Syrmia County was an administrative division of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages. This area was taken by the Ottoman Empire in 1521 and the two counties were abolished. The territory was then (in 1544) included into Ottoman Sanjak of Syrmia. The Habsburg monarchy took one part of Syrmia from the Ottomans in 1688, while the other part was taken by Habsburgs in 1718. The entire region was incorporated into the Military Frontier, which was then extended from Western Slavonia, where it stood in 1683, all the way to Transylvania.

==History==

Syrmia County was re-established in 1745 as part of the Kingdom of Slavonia, a Habsburg province, which was part of both the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. This new county did not cover the whole of its later territory – the southern and furthest eastern parts instead passed to the Slavonian Military Frontier (and partially to the Banat Military Frontier 1849–60). The Kingdom of Slavonia was mainly inhabited by Serbs and Croats.

In 1848 and 1849, the area of the county was part of the Serbian Voivodship, a Serbian autonomous region proclaimed at the May Assembly in Karlovci. Between 1849 and 1860 the eastern part of the county was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate crown land of the Austrian Empire, formally becoming part of the Neusatz District from 1854; the western part around Vukovar passed to the Slavonian Osijek County.

After 1860, Syrmia County was established again, and was reincorporated into the Kingdom of Slavonia, which was a completely separate Habsburg province at the time. In 1867, as a consequence of the between the Austrians and the Hungarians, the Kingdom of Slavonia was incorporated into Transleithania, the half of Austria-Hungary run from Budapest, and in the Hungarian-Croatian Settlement of 1868, it was incorporated into Croatia-Slavonia, a formally separate kingdom within the Kingdom of Hungary, which had a certain level of autonomy and was ruled by its own &quot;ban&quot;.

In 1881 the Slavonian Military Frontier was abolished; the Petrovaradin district and part of the Brod district would be merged into Syrmia County by 1886.

After World War I, the area of Syrmia County became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918 and this was confirmed by the Treaty of Saint-Germain in September 1919. The County of Syrmia was an official administrative division of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes between 1918 and 1922, and then was transformed into the Province (Oblast) of Syrmia (de facto it was carried out in 1924).

<text>Royal Air Force Chivenor, or more simply RAF Chivenor, is a former Royal Air Force station located on the northern shore of the River Taw estuary, on the north coast of Devon, England. The nearest towns are Barnstaple and Braunton.

Originally a civil airfield opened in the 1930s, the site was taken over by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in May 1940 for use as a RAF Coastal Command Station. After the Second World War, the station was largely used for training, particularly weapons training. During the 1950s and 1960s, No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit RAF (229 OCU) used Hawker Hunter aircraft for training. In 1974 the station was left on &quot;care and maintenance&quot;, though No. 624 Volunteer Gliding Squadron (624 VGS) continued to fly from there. The RAF returned in 1979, forming 2 Tactical Weapons Unit (2 TWU) which flew BAE Systems Hawks, from 1979 until the unit was renamed as No. 7 Flying Training School RAF (7 FTS) in 1992. In 1994, 7 FTS left Chivenor, merging with No. 4 Flying Training School RAF (4 FTS) at RAF Valley, and the airfield was handed over to the Royal Marines. The Marines have an existing equipment testing base at RM Instow, in Instow, located across the Taw Estuary and approximately two miles from Chivenor.

No. 22 Squadron RAF (22 Sqn) operated a Search and Rescue flight at Chivenor from 1956, flying Westland Whirlwind, Westland Wessex and Westland Sea King helicopters. In a spending review that was announced over the summer of 2004, the presence of 22 Squadron at Chivenor was under review. After the flooding at Boscastle, this threat was rescinded. &quot;A&quot; flight of 22 Squadron was disbanded in October 2015, with the search and rescue role being assumed by Bristow Helicopters on behalf of Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard.

In 1995, the site became Royal Marines Base Chivenor primarily used by 3 Commando Brigade.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chivenor&quot; is first attested in 1285, as &quot;Chivenore&quot;. This is thought to originate in Old English as a personal name, &quot;Cifa&quot;, in its genitive form &quot;Cifan&quot;, combined with the Old English word &quot;ōra&quot; (&#x27;flat-topped ridge&#x27;). Thus the name once meant &#x27;Cifa&#x27;s flat-topped ridge&#x27;. The ridge in question runs from west to east along the north bank of the River Taw, from Heanton Punchardon to Tutshill Wood on the northern fringe of Barnstaple. Like Heanton Punchardon, RM Chivenor lies at the west end of the ridge.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
In February 1940 the Air Ministry constructed an aerodrome on the site of Chivenor farm near a civilian airfield. RAF Chivenor opened on 25 October 1940 within No. 17 Group, Coastal Command. There were two units based there initially, No. 3 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit RAF and No. 252 Squadron RAF, both operating Bristol Beaufighters, Bristol Blenheims and Bristol Beauforts.

=== 1942–1945 ===
From 1942 onward the role of Chivenor was changed from training to anti-submarine patrolling. From 1942 to 1943 the squadron flew the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, then in 1943 the Chivenor squadron converted to the Vickers Wellington equipped with the ASV radar and Leigh lights.

; November 1941 to September 1943
: No. 51 Squadron RAF: (51 Sqn) Whitleys
: No. 77 Squadron RAF: (77 Sqn) Whitleys / Wellingtons
: No. 502 (Ulster) Squadron RAF: (502 Sqn) Whitleys / Wellingtons
: No. 1417 (Leigh Light Trials) Flight: (1417 Flt) Wellington Leigh light training and development unit
; July 1942 to September 1943
: No. 235 Squadron RAF: (235 Sqn) Beaufighters
: No. 236 Squadron RAF: (236 Sqn) Beaufighters
: No. 248 Squadron RAF: (248 Sqn) Beaufighters
; September 1943 to the end of the war
: No. 172 Squadron RAF: (172 Sqn) Wellingtons
: No. 407 (Demon) Squadron RCAF: (407 Sqn) Wellingtons
: No. 612 (County of Aberdeen) Squadron RAuxAF: (612 Sqn) Wellingtons
: No. 304 Polish Bomber Squadron: (304 Sqn) Wellingtons
; Plan for post war 1945
: No. 14 Squadron RAF (14 Sqn)
: No. 36 Squadron RAF (36 Sqn)

In November 1941 the structure of the base changed with three new squadrons 51, 77 and 502 flying a mixture of Whitleys and Wellingtons, and one new flight, 1417, that was used to training crews on the Leigh light and radar Wellingtons. In July 1942 three squadrons of Beaufighter were located at Chivenor to offer long range protection in the Bay of Biscay. By September 1943 all of the Whitleys had been taken out of active service at Chivenor, and four squadrons of Wellingtons, 172, 407, 612 and 304, were located at the base. No 172 was the Wellington Training Squadron, taking over from 1417 Flight. The base had personnel from Canada, Poland and the UK. The Plan for the post war, was for Chivenor to become a full-time anti-submarine wing with two squadron&#x27;s 14 and 36 Squadron.

=== 1946—1949 ===
After the Second World War ended, the future of the station was not certain. In 1946 a group of miscellaneous meteorological and anti-aircraft units moved to Chivenor, including Handley Page Halifaxes of Nos 517 and 521 Squadrons which flew 10-hour sorties to collect weather information. At the same time the station played host to No 248 Squadron (de Havilland Mosquitoes), No 254 Squadron (Beaufighters), and the Supermarine Spitfires and Miles Martinets of No 691 Squadron, Army Air Corps. In October 1946, No. 11 Group RAF Fighter Command took command of the station with No. 203 Advanced Flying School. This lasted until July 1949 when the station was transferred to 5 and 7 Squadrons, Army Air Corps and No. 1 Overseas Ferry Unit. This latter unit had the duties to ferry Gloster Meteors, de Havilland Vampires and Mosquitoes to the Middle East and the Far East.

=== 1950—1974 ===
In February 1950 the Chivenor station flight was formed with de Havilland Tiger Moths. It was at this time that post-war civilian flying restarted, with Wrafton flying club later changing its name to the Puffin flying club. At this time the RAF was operating as No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit which flew Vampires and Meteors. Then in mid 1955 the first of the Hawker Hunter operational conversion courses was started: flying was still mainly on the Vampire FB5 with approximately 20 hrs on the Hunter F1 before pilots were sent to their operational squadrons. During the next two years the Vampires were phased out and the course became all Hunter once the Hunter T7, a two-seater trainer version, became available. There were 2 squadrons called simply 1 and 2, each capable of training a student from conversion to operational and weaponry training. Operational Units were 229 OCU, consisting of 2 squadrons and Chivenor Station Flight.

In May 1957 the RAF exercise &#x27;Vigilant&#x27; changed Chivenor&#x27;s Squadrons&#x27; status. They assumed a wartime reserve role and were renumbered as Nos 145 and 234 Squadrons. The squadrons were now flying the Hunter F4 and T7 until the F4 was replaced by the F6. The two squadrons were numbered and then renumbered until they became 63 (Reserve) and 79 (Reserve) Squadrons, tasked with training RAF fighter pilots. Hunter FR.10 fighter reconnaissance aircraft were also flown by 229 OCU in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In March 1967 the oil tanker ran aground on Seven Stones Reef near Lands End, spilling oil. For three days, Hunters from Chivenor and other bases fired training rockets at the ship to hole it below the waterline, before bombing it with high explosives and napalm in an unsuccessful effort to burn off the oil.  The final Hunter unit based at Chivenor was the Singapore Operational Training Flight. In 1974, 229 OCU was transferred to RAF Brawdy and the station was put into a rebuilding programme. It was in June 1957 that a new chapter in Chivenor&#x27;s story started with the arrival of &#x27;E&#x27; Flight 275 Squadron with their Bristol Sycamore HR14s on search and rescue duties. In 1958 &#x27;E&#x27; Flight changed to &#x27;A&#x27; Flight 22 Squadron, which has over 50 years of twenty-four-hour search and rescue experience operating from Chivenor.

=== Hawks at RAF Chivenor ===
In 1979 the RAF rebuilding programme ended and the station was reactivated, hosting 2 TWU, flying British Aerospace Hawk T1&#x27;s with No. 63 Squadron RAF (63(R)) and No. 151 Squadron RAF (151(R)) squadrons, training fast jet pilots and navigators. In 1992, the government&#x27;s options for change defence review resulted in the structure of the station changing with 2 TWU being re-designated as No. 7 Flying Training School RAF (7 FTS), the squadrons changing identities from 63(R) and 151(R) to No. 19 Squadron RAF (19(R)) and No. 92 Squadron RAF (92(R)). 7 FTS operated in conjunction with No. 4 Flying Training School RAF (4 FTS) at RAF Valley, as the so-called Mirror Image Training Course which lasted for three years until 1995. when the Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced that RAF Chivenor would close, which it did on 1 October 1995.

== Operational Units ==

=== 1979-1992 ===

: No. 151(R) Squadron RAF

=== 1992-1995 ===

; 7 FTS
: No. 19(R) Squadron RAF
: No. 92(R) Squadron RAF

== Post-RAF use ==

From 1 October 1995 onwards, the Royal Marines took control of the base, it being renamed Royal Marines Base Chivenor (RMB Chivenor) and is home to the Commando Logistics Regiment, Royal Marines and 24 Commando Regiment Royal Engineers.

The airfield is still an operational airfield used by the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and RAF as well as No. 624 Volunteer Gliding Squadron RAF (624 VGS) operating Grob Vigilant T1 motor gliders, providing flights for the Air Training Corps and Combined Cadet Force.

<text>Ernst Christian Wilhelm Ackermann (14 June 1761, in Weimar – 4 October 1835, in Jena) was a German public servant and writer.

He studied in Leipzig and Jena between 1779 and 1782, and was a childhood friend of August von Kotzebue. In the following years, he worked as judiciary auditor under his father in Ilmenau, and later as private lecturer. In 1790, he became adjunct and when his father died in 1792, Ernst Ackermann took his place as judiciary bailiff. Ackerman resigned when Ilmenau was annexed to Weimar and economic conditions became less favourable. Consequently, he was assigned Privy Referendar at the Ministry of Justice where he stayed until 1826, when he retired.

Ackermann made a large number of anonymous contributions to different journals. After the death of Kotzebue, he remained the sole editor of the &quot;Literarisches Wochenblatt&quot;.

<doc id="935003" wikidata="Q1059359" url="?curid=935003" title="Varaždin County (former)">
<text>Varaždin County (; ) was an administrative subdivision (&quot;županija&quot;) of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Croatia-Slavonia was an autonomous kingdom within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Transleithania), the Hungarian part of the dual Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its territory is now in northern Croatia. The capital of the county was Varaždin (Croatian, in Hungarian: &quot;Varasd&quot;).

==Geography==
Varaždin County shared borders with the Austrian land Styria, the Hungarian county of Zala, and the Croatian-Slavonian county of Bjelovar-Križevci and Zagreb. It comprised the towns and market towns of Ivanec, Jalžabet, Lepoglava, Ludbreg, Prelog, Čakovec, Klanjec, Krapina, Novi Marof and Varaždinske Toplice. 

The river Drava formed its northern border after Međimurje became part of Hungarian Zala County in 1720. Its area was 2521 km² around 1910.

==History==
The territory of Varaždin County was part of the Kingdom of Croatia when it entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1102, and with it became part of the Habsburg monarchy in 1526. After 1607, the position of the county&#x27;s was hereditary, given to the Erdődy noble family. Until the 18th century it was part of the Varaždin Generalate of the Military Frontier.

In 1850, following the revolutions of 1848, Varaždin County gained Međimurje from the Hungarian Zala County (except for the area around Legrad, which went to Križevci County). It was divided into four (political) districts ():
* Warasdin
* Klanjec
* Krapina
* Csakaturn (Čakovec)

In 1854, as part of Bach&#x27;s absolutism, it was restructured again, absorbing much of Križevci County. The 1850 districts were replaced with a different system (still referred to as but functionally different).

The cities of Kreutz (Križevci), Kopreinitz (Koprivnica) and Warasdin/Varasdin (Varaždin) themselves were city-districts () separate from the districts listed above (which were ).

Its territory was restored to its pre-1850 state in 1860.
In 1871 the Varaždin Generalate of the Military Frontier was integrated into Croatia-Slavonia. As a result the territory of the surrounding counties was altered; Varaždin County gained some territory from both Zagreb and Križevci Counties. In 1886 its territory was altered again, with some returned to Zagreb and some more gained from Križevci (which became part of Bjelovar-Križevci County in the same reform). This configuration would remain in place until the county&#x27;s dissolution.

In 1918 Croatia-Slavonia &quot;de facto&quot; seceded from Austria-Hungary as part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia) soon after. This was recognised in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. The county was formally abolished in 1922 when the Vidovdan Constitution came into force. Since 1991, when Croatia became independent from Yugoslavia, the county is part of the Republic of Croatia.

<text>The Independence Day Derecho of 1977 was a derecho, or long-lived windstorm associated with a fast-moving band of thunderstorms, that swept across the Great Lakes region of the U.S. on July 4, 1977. It lasted around 15½ hours. The derecho formed in western Minnesota around 10 a.m. CDT on July 4 and became more intense around noon in the central part of the state. The derecho produced winds of in northern Wisconsin, felling thousands of trees.

==Wisconsin==
As the storm raced through Burnett, Washburn, Sawyer, Price, and Oneida counties, it caused a band of damage wide. Nearly of forest were badly damaged or destroyed. The derecho caused $24M in property damage. One person was killed and 35 were injured.

Here is a summary of damage by county:
* Sawyer County, Wisconsin - A wind gust of was measured at the Hayward airport. The downburst winds destroyed several homes and barns. Winds of were estimated at the Flambeau River State Forest. A woman was killed when a tree fell on her camper at Connors Lake. Nearby, an area of old-growth forest was almost completely destroyed.
* Price County, Wisconsin - The storm continued to damage several homes and injured 20 people. The gust front reached Phillips around 2:55 p.m. CDT and the severe winds lasted for 25 minutes. An anemometer at the airport registered a wind gust. All the homes in the Phillips area were damaged. Thirty were damaged beyond repair.
* Oneida County, Wisconsin - The derecho continued to damage homes and blow down large areas of forest. The gust front entered Rhinelander around 3:30 p.m. CDT. A wind speed of was recorded at the airport. Seven people were injured in this county. The severe winds continued through northeastern Wisconsin and across Lake Michigan.

==Michigan==
The derecho was not nearly as strong in Michigan as it was in Wisconsin. Many trees blew over and caused damage to homes and buildings as it moved into Manistee and Ludington. The storm spawned tornadoes as it moved into central Lower Michigan and two people were injured—one from an overturned mobile home and another from an overturned camper.

The derecho moved through Lower Michigan throughout the afternoon and evening before dissipating in northern Ohio around 1:30 a.m. EDT on July 5. A total of of forest were damaged or destroyed, and the storm caused a total of $30M damage (1977 dollars).

==Bow Echo discovered==
After the storm, Dr. T. Theodore Fujita became aware of the extreme wind damage over northern Wisconsin and decided to conduct an investigation. He noticed that there were three areas of extreme damage from northeastern Minnesota to extreme northwestern Wisconsin, and then two more areas of forest blowdowns extending from Hayward to Rhinelander.

He then went back and looked at the radar echos, and he noticed that they evolved into a bow signature. It was during this investigation that Dr Fujita discovered the &quot;bow&quot; or &quot;spearhead radar echo&quot;.

<doc id="935020" wikidata="Q928745" url="?curid=935020" title="Virovitica County">
<text>Virovitica County (; ) was an administrative subdivision () of the Medieval Kingdom of Croatia, the Kingdom of Slavonia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Slavonia was an autonomous kingdom within both Croatia and Hungary, themselves within the Habsburg Monarchy/Austrian Empire; Croatia-Slavonia, its successor, was an autonomous kingdom within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Transleithania), the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary. Its territory is now in eastern Croatia. The name of the county comes from the town of Virovitica (). The capital of the county moved from Virovitica to Osijek (Croatian; ) in the late 18th century.

==Geography==
Virovitica County shared borders with the Hungarian counties of Somogy, Baranya, Bács-Bodrog, and the Croatian-Slavonian counties of Srijem, Požega and Bjelovar-Križevci. The county stretched along the right (southern) bank of the river Drava, down to its confluence with the river Danube. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
The territory of Virovitica County was part of the Kingdom of Croatia when it entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1102, and with it became part of the Habsburg monarchy in 1526. It was conquered by the Ottoman Empire between 1541 and 1552. Ottoman rule in it lasted until 1687. The County was re-established as a county of the Kingdom of Slavonia in 1718, after it was retaken from Ottoman rule.

In 1854, as part of Bach&#x27;s reforms, it was renamed Osijek County () and its territory changed: its western areas around Voćin, Slatina and Virovitica passed to Požega County and it absorbed the western parts of the former County of Syrmia around Vukovar. (The eastern part of Syrmia now belonged to the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar.) These changes were reversed in 1860.

In 1868 it became part of Croatia-Slavonia.

In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon the county became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). It was formally abolished in 1922 when the Vidovdan Constitution came into effect. The county&#x27;s former territory has been part of Croatia since it became independent from Yugoslavia 1991.

<text>Gissi (Abruzzese: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; located in the Province of Chieti, Abruzzo, Italy.

It is bordered by two tributaries of the Sinello River and is surrounded by vineyards and olive groves.

== History ==

Gissi has been populated since prehistoric times. In the 12th century it was under the influence of the D&#x27;Avalos family.

== Main sights==

The &quot;Palazzo Carunchio&quot; and the ruins of the Castle are exemplary of the town&#x27;s buildings, balconies, and alleys. Built in the 19th century, the Palazzo Carunchio now serves as the Town Hall, and houses the town&#x27;s administrative offices. The town has other fine examples of &quot;palazzi&quot; from the 18th and 19th centuries, adorned with fine architectural details. Also notable is that many Gissi homes are covered with gesso, a material obtained from nearby caves and hills.

The Church of &quot;Santa Maria Assunta&quot; is Gissi&#x27;s oldest church, which was remodeled in 1955. Inside, it houses silver crosses from the Neapolitan School dating to the 17th and 18th centuries, a 17th-century wooden statue of Saint Pamphilus, and a wooden cross from the late 12th. Its ceiling contains a reproduction of the &quot;Annunciation&quot; attributed to Guido Reni, and its 16th century wooden organ is carved and gilded with gold. The church also has two chapels dedicated to the Immaculate Conception and Sacred Heart.

Another church is the &quot;Cappella di Santa Lucia&quot; located in La Pineta, a pine tree park which affords views of the surrounding countryside, including the Adriatic Sea.

== Culture ==

Gissi is home to a variety of feasts and festivals, many of which are religious feasts in celebration of saints. These include the 20 May feast of St. Bernardino of Siena, who is buried at L&#x27;Aquila in the cathedral dedicated in his name. Other feasts include the Feast of St. Lucy on August 20 and the Feast of St. Roch on August 19.

== People==

<doc id="935037" wikidata="Q1068742" url="?curid=935037" title="ICOCA">
<text>ICOCA () is a rechargeable contactless smart card used on the JR West rail network in Japan. The card was launched on November 1, 2003, for usage on the Urban Network, which encompasses the major cities of Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe (Keihanshin). It is now usable on many other networks nationwide. The ICOCA area has gradually been expanded, and now includes the San&#x27;yo region through the Okayama and Hiroshima urban areas, and some lines in northern Shikoku, San&#x27;in and Hokuriku regions as of 2024.

ICOCA is an abbreviation of &quot;IC Operating Card&quot; and is also a play on the phrase , an informal, Kansai dialect invitation meaning &quot;Shall we go?&quot;

The mascot for ICOCA is a blue platypus named . Platypus characters for the children&#x27;s ICOCA also exist and are named and .

== Functions and services ==
Usage of the card involves passing it over a card reader. The technology allows for the card to be read at some distance from the reader, so contact is not required, and many people leave the card in their wallet and just pass the wallet over the reader as they enter the ticket gate.

The balance on the card is displayed when passing through fare gates or inserting it into a ticket vending machine. A travel record is stored on the card, and may be displayed or printed out at fare adjustment or ticket vending machines.

On occasion, when traveling to a station where ICOCA is not supported, the card must be handed over to railway staff at the ticket gate so that they may calculate the fare to deduct, and to provide riders with a transfer slip, which can be given to staff at the next station where ICOCA is used.

ICOCA functions as a also supports functionality. However, for express services, such as the Haruka service to Kansai airport, on which an additional fee is required, ICOCA can only be used as , for passing the ticket gate, for non-reserved travel, while the express ticket must purchased from the conductor on board the train (see train tickets in Japan).

=== Variants ===
*Standard ICOCA
**ICOCA 定期券 (&quot;teikiken&quot;) – with commuter pass
**こどもICOCA (&quot;kodomo&quot;) – children&#x27;s ICOCA (discounted fare)
**こどもICOCA 定期券 – children&#x27;s ICOCA with commuter pass
*Smart ICOCA
**Smart ICOCA 定期券 – with commuter pass

Cards that are functionally equivalent to the standard ICOCA but with a visually different front design are sold by JR Shikoku, IR Ishikawa Railway, Ainokaze Toyama Railway, and Hapi-Line Fukui.

The KIPS ICOCA variant was formerly sold by Kintetsu Railway.

== Interoperation ==

Since March 2013, ICOCA has been part of Japan&#x27;s Nationwide Mutual Usage Service, allowing it to be used in major cities across the country. Prior to this system of interoperability between the 10 IC cards, a number of bilateral partnerships were formed with other companies and operators:
* On August 1, 2004, in a reciprocal agreement with JR East, ICOCA became usable in the Tokyo-Kantō area. Conversely, JR East&#x27;s Suica became usable on JR West rail services.
* On January 21, 2006, ICOCA became usable at all locations accepting Osaka PiTaPa smart cards.
* On September 1, 2007, ICOCA became usable in the Hiroshima and Okayama areas, in agreement with local transit operators.
* On March 29, 2008, in a reciprocal agreement with JR Central, ICOCA became usable in the Nagoya metropolitan area. Similarly, JR Central&#x27;s TOICA became usable on JR West rail services.
* On March 5, 2011, in a reciprocal agreement with JR Kyushu, ICOCA became usable in the Fukuoka–Saga area. Similarly, JR Kyushu&#x27;s SUGOCA became usable on JR West rail services.
* On June 1, 2011, ICOCA became usable on Keihan lines.
* On March 17, 2012, ICOCA became usable in some stations of JR Shikoku, such as in the Takamatsu area.
* On December 1, 2012, ICOCA became usable on Kintetsu lines.

==Retail==
These cards are available at card vending machines at the train stations. Cards cost 2000 yen, which includes a 500 yen deposit that will be returned if the card is returned. The remaining 1500 yen is immediately available for use on transit, and more money can be charged on to the card at similar ticket vending machines or fare adjustment machines inside each station.

Cards may only be returned in JR West stations, meaning that travelers who start their trip in JR West&#x27;s service area and finish their trip elsewhere may not be able to return it before departure. Shikoku ICOCA are sold at several stations in Shikoku and can only be returned at those stations, and feature a special design.

== Technology ==
The card incorporates contactless RFID technology developed by Sony called FeliCa. The same technology is also deployed in other IC cards across Japan, in Edy electronic cash cards, and in the Octopus card in Hong Kong.

== Mobile devices ==
A version for mobile phones known as , which uses Mobile FeliCa and Osaifu-Keitai functionality, was launched in March 2023.

<doc id="935041" wikidata="Q59950" url="?curid=935041" title="Urbanism">
<text>Urbanism is the study of how inhabitants of urban areas, such as towns and cities, interact with the built environment. It is a direct component of disciplines such as urban planning, a profession focusing on the design and management of urban areas, and urban sociology, an academic field which studies urban life.

Many architects, planners, geographers, and sociologists investigate the way people live in densely populated urban areas. There is a wide variety of different theories and approaches to the study of urbanism. However, in some contexts internationally, &quot;urbanism&quot; is synonymous with urban planning, and &quot;urbanist&quot; refers to an urban planner.

The term &quot;urbanism&quot; originated in the late nineteenth century with the Spanish civil engineer Ildefons Cerdà, whose intent was to create an autonomous activity focused on the spatial organization of the city. Urbanism&#x27;s emergence in the early 20th century was associated with the rise of centralized manufacturing, mixed-use neighborhoods, social organizations and networks, and what has been described as &quot;the convergence between political, social and economic citizenship&quot;.

Urbanism can be understood as placemaking and the creation of place identity at a citywide level, however as early as 1938 Louis Wirth wrote that it is necessary to stop &#x27;identify[ing] urbanism with the physical entity of the city&#x27;, go &#x27;beyond an arbitrary boundary line&#x27; and consider how &#x27;technological developments in transportation and communication have enormously extended the urban mode of living beyond the confines of the city itself.&#x27; 

==Concepts==
===Network-based theories===
Gabriel Dupuy applied network theory to the field of urbanism and suggests that the single dominant characteristic of modern urbanism is its networked character, as opposed to segregated conceptions of space (i.e. zones, boundaries and edges).

Stephen Graham and Simon Marvin argue that we are witnessing a post-urban environment where decentralized, loosely connected neighborhoods and zones of activity assume the former organizing role played by urban spaces. Their theory of &quot;splintering urbanism&quot; involves the &quot;fragmentation of the social and material fabric of cities&quot; into &quot;cellular clusters of globally connected high-service enclaves and network ghettos&quot; driven by electronic networks that segregate as much as they connect. Dominique Lorrain argues that the process of splintering urbanism began towards the end of the 20th century with the emergence of the gigacity, a new form of a networked city characterised by three-dimensional size, network density and the blurring of city boundaries.

Manuel Castells suggested that within a network society, &quot;premium&quot; infrastructure networks (high-speed telecommunications, &quot;smart&quot; highways, global airline networks) selectively connect together the most favored users and places and bypass the less favored. Graham and Marvin argue that attention to infrastructure networks is reactive to crises or collapse, rather than sustained and systematic, because of a failure to understand the links between urban life and urban infrastructure networks.

===Other modern theorists===
Douglas Kelbaugh identifies three paradigms within urbanism: New Urbanism, Everyday Urbanism, and Post-Urbanism.

Paul L. Knox refers to one of many trends in contemporary urbanism as the &quot;aestheticization of everyday life&quot;.

Alex Krieger states that urban design is less a technical discipline than a mind-set based on a commitment to cities.

Other contemporary urbanists such as Edward Soja and Liz Ogbu focus on urbanism as a field for applying principles of community building and spatial justice.

<doc id="935042" wikidata="Q2755519" url="?curid=935042" title="Nigel Walker (athlete)">
<text>Nigel Walker (born 15 June 1963) is a former Welsh track and field athlete and Wales international rugby union player. He is currently Welsh Rugby Union&#x27;s acting CEO, after the resignation of Steve Phillips. He was born in Cardiff.

Walker represented Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 1984 Summer Olympics in the 110 metres hurdles. In 1988 and 1992 he failed to make the squad for the Summer Olympics and in 1992 turned to rugby union. Walker holds the fastest non-winning time for the 200-metre hurdles. At Cardiff in 1991, he ran 22.77 seconds into a 0.3 m/s headwind.

As a rugby player, he played on the wing for Cardiff RFC. Walker made his Wales debut on 6 March 1993 in the five nations match against Ireland. He went on to win 17 caps for Wales, scoring 12 tries and making his final appearance 21 February 1998 against England.

Walker was a participant in &quot;Catchphrase&quot;, a Welsh learning programme broadcast on Radio Wales in 2000. Walker was appointed Head of Sport at BBC Wales in 2001. In 2010, Walker became the National Director at the English Institute of Sport (EIS). In 2018, celebrating Black History Month in the United Kingdom, Walker was included in a list of 100 &quot;Brilliant, Black and Welsh&quot; people.

Walker left his role at the EIS in Autumn 2021, to take up the position of Performance Director at the Welsh Rugby Union. He became the acting CEO of the WRU in January 2023 following the resignation of Steve Phillips.

Contrary to a frequent rumour, he did not participate in &quot;Gladiators&quot;. Walker dispelled the rumour: &quot;I didn’t compete in Gladiators. It’s a big myth. Glen Webbe did, I didn’t. I have corrected it on Wikipedia three times and it keeps coming back up&quot;.

<doc id="935048" wikidata="Q1438082" url="?curid=935048" title="Monarch of the Glen (TV series)">
<text>Monarch of the Glen is a British drama television series produced by Ecosse Films for BBC Scotland and broadcast on BBC One for seven series between February 2000 and October 2005 with 64 episodes in total.

The first five series of &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; told the story of young restaurateur Archie MacDonald trying to restore his childhood home in the Scottish Highlands, starring Alastair Mackenzie, Richard Briers, Susan Hampshire and Dawn Steele. The final two series focused on new Laird Paul Bowman trying to modernise the estate, primarily starring Lloyd Owen, Tom Baker, Alexander Morton and Susan Hampshire.

The series is loosely based on Sir Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;Highland Novels&quot;, which are set in the same location but in the 1930s and 1940s. The first book in that series is called &quot;The Monarch of the Glen&quot;, which was a reference to the famous painting of the same name by Landseer.

The series was created by Michael Chaplin and produced by Nick Pitt, Paddy Higson, Jeremy Gwilt, Stephen Garwood and Rob Bullock. The show saw many directors, most notably Edward Bennett, Richard Signy, Rick Stroud and Robert Knights; and many writers including Chaplin, Niall Leonard, John Martin Johnson, Leslie Stewart and Jeremy Front. Filming took between six and eight months per series in the Badenoch and Strathspey area of the Scottish Highlands, in particular at Ardverikie House, which was the location for the fictional &quot;Glenbogle House&quot;.

In September 2023, the series was made permanently available on BBC iPlayer.

Archie faces a tough decision: whether to help the debt-ridden Glenbogle or to return to Justine in London. Archie meets the local school headteacher, Katrina Finlay, with whom he begins a complicated friendship. The feisty staff of Glenbogle — Lexie, Golly and Duncan — also prove hard to handle.

Hector visits an old flame to try to get the trails on the estate approved by the local council.

He asks Katrina to go with him, and she leaves because Archie will not state his love for her. Archie chases her train but discovers from Fergal that she has already disembarked.

When Molly discovers that Andrew has proposed to many women and painted them all wearing his mother&#x27;s engagement ring, she realises she cannot trust him.

== Cast ==

===Regular cast===

The following is a list of the regular cast of &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; who were credited in the opening credits of the show (in appearance order).

===Recurring roles===

The following is a list, in order of appearance, of actors who were in three or more episodes of &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; as the same character but who were not credited as a regular in the opening titles of the show.

==Locations==
While the fictional Glenbogle estate in Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s Highland novels place the estate near Ben Nevis, the series is filmed in and around the Cairngorms, Badenoch and Strathspey, with Ben Nevis replaced by the fictional Ben Bogle.

Ardverikie House, designed by John Rhind in 1870 and built in the Scottish baronial style, depicts Glenbogle Castle in &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot;, while location filming took place in Kingussie and Laggan and scenes involving the loch use Loch Laggan. The majority of the programme was filmed on and around the Ardverikie Estate situated on the South-East bank of Loch Laggan. Glenbogle Station was filmed at Broomhill railway station, near Nethy Bridge. This station is the terminus of the Strathspey Railway, a restored steam railway.

The River Pattack just up from the Ardverikie Estate was used several times. Glenbogle Church is the Cille Choirille Church near Roy Bridge. Lord Kilwillie&#x27;s Castle is Balavil House, off the A9 road 2 miles north-east of Kingussie.

==Broadcast history==
Seven series were filmed, totaling 64 episodes (including a Hogmanay Special). The series was broadcasting internationally USA (BBC America and PBS), Australia (ABC), Canada (BBC Canada), Norway, Sweden, Hong Kong, New Zealand, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Vietnam and Dubai. The series is shown to more than 100 countries on BBC Entertainment (formerly BBC Prime), the BBC&#x27;s 24-hour global entertainment channel, broadcast to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Publicity in the United States included front-page coverage in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; was Australia&#x27;s most popular BBC drama in 2002 and 2003.

&quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sunday evenings on BBC One, usually at 20.00 GMT. British ratings in the first five series were high, but lowered after the departure of several of the main characters (Archie, Hector, Lexie, Duncan and Katrina). A petition was formed by 21-year-old &quot;Boglie&quot; Emma Richards to ensure that lead character Archie stayed on the show, but it failed when the actor left the show midway through the fifth series.

Ratings hit an all-time low in 2004, and BBC bosses axed the show, but promised that they would bring back many of the cast from earlier series for a fantastic series finale. The seventh and final series saw the return of Richard Briers, Hamish Clark and Julian Fellowes as promised by the BBC, but the reunion did not include Archie or Lexie.

==DVD releases==

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Kohlrausch (14 October 1840 – 17 January 1910) was a German physicist who investigated the conductive properties of electrolytes and contributed to knowledge of their behaviour. He also investigated elasticity, thermoelasticity, and thermal conduction as well as magnetic and electrical precision measurements.

Nowadays, Friedrich Kohlrausch is classed as one of the most important experimental physicists. His early work helped to extend the absolute system of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber to include electrical and magnetic measuring units.

==Biography==

===Education===
Son of Rudolf Kohlrausch, Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Kohlrausch was born on October 14, 1840, in Rinteln, Germany. After studying physics at Erlangen and Göttingen, Friedrich Kohlrausch completed his doctorate in Göttingen.

===Teaching===
After a two-year work as a lecturer in Frankfurt, Kohlrausch was appointed a professor of physics at the University of Göttingen (1866–70).
During 1870 Kohlrausch became a professor at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. One year later, he moved to the Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany.

In 1875, he responded to an offer from the University of Würzburg in southern Germany, where he subsequently conducted his experiments in quantity determination and the conductivity of electrolytes. From 1888 he researched and taught at Strasbourg University.

He refused a professorship at the Humboldt University in Berlin in 1894, but from 1900 he was also a professor there. He was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1900 and an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1901. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences during 1902. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1909.

==Research work==
Kohlrausch was an important researcher of electrochemistry for many reasons. First, the experiments from which he deduced his law of independent migration of ions became canonical and disseminated from Kohlrausch&#x27;s laboratories in Göttingen, Zürich, and Darmstadt; Svante Arrhenius, Wilhelm Ostwald and Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff, the original Ionists, all trained with methods and equipment of Kohlrauschian lineage. Moreover, because Kohlrausch also continued to test and confirm the Ionist theory after it had been first proposed, his work tied &quot;measuring physics&quot; and its consequent capability of producing plenty of empirical data to the results and methods of the Ionists and their devotees.

===Electrolyte conductivity in solution===
In 1874 he demonstrated that an electrolyte has a definite and constant amount of electrical resistance. By observing the dependence of conductivity upon dilution, he could determine the transfer velocities of the ions (charged atoms or molecules) in solution. He used alternating current to prevent the formation of electrolysis products ( and gas evolution, or metal deposition); this enabled him to obtain very precise results.

From 1875 to 1879, he examined numerous salt solutions, acids and solutions of other materials. His efforts resulted in the law of the independent migration of ions, that is, each type of migrating ion has a specific limiting molar conductivity no matter what combination of ions are in solution, and therefore that a solution&#x27;s electrical resistance is due only to the migrating ions of a given substances. Kohlrausch showed for weak (incompletely dissociated) electrolytes that the more dilute a solution, the greater its molar conductivity due to increased ionic dissociation.

===Measuring techniques and instruments===
During 1895 he succeeded Hermann von Helmholtz as President of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR – Imperial Physical Technical Institute), an office which he held until 1905.

Here, as in the past, his activities were focused on experimental and instrumental physics: he constructed instruments and devised new measuring techniques to examine electrolytic conduction in solutions. He concluded the setup of the PTR, a task which had not yet been completed on the death of its first president. He introduced fixed regulations, work schedules and working hours for the Institute.

Under direction of Kohlrausch, the PTR created numerous standards and calibration standards which were also used internationally outside Germany.

Kohlrausch was intent on creating optimum working conditions in the laboratories and to shield the labs from unwanted external influences. For six years, for instance, he fought against a streetcar line which was due to be laid near the PTR. However, before the streetcar was to make its first journey, the institute succeeded in developing an astatic torsion magnetometer which was uninfluenced by disturbing electromagnetic fields. The use of this instrument and the shielded wire galvanometer developed by du Bois and Rubens meant that precision electrical and magnetic work continued to be possible.

Over the years, Kohlrausch added experiments which met the needs of physical chemistry and electrical technology in particular. He improved precision measuring instruments and developed numerous measuring methods in almost all of the fields of physics known during his lifetime, including a reflectivity meter, a tangent galvanometer, and various types of magnetometers and dynamometers. The Kohlrausch bridge, which he invented at that time for the purpose of measuring conductivity, is still well known today. 
Like Helmholtz and Siemens, Kohlrausch also saw the possibilities inherent in applied and basic research in the natural sciences and technology. He lay the foundations for scientific knowledge which promoted and advanced industry and technology. The PTR developed standardized precision instruments for university research institutes and industrial laboratories. It introduced uniform electrical units for Germany and also played a significant role in their international usage. In the period to 1905, there were many examples of the importance of the PTR for German industry, in particular for the high technologies of the time – the electrical, optical and mechanical industries.

Overall, Kohlrausch was involved in the measurement of electrical, magnetic and electrochemical phenomena for almost 50 years. In 1905 Kohlrausch retired from his post as President of the PTR.

Friedrich Kohlrausch died in Marburg on 17 January 1910 at the age of 69.

===Writings===
In the University of Göttingen, Kohlrausch documented his practical experiments resulting in the book &quot;Leitfaden der praktischen Physik&quot; (Guidelines to Practical Physics), which was published in 1870 as the first book of its type in Germany. It contained not only descriptions of experiments, experimental setups and measuring techniques, but also tables of physical quantities. It was issued in many editions (the 9th enlarged and revised edition of 1901 being entitled &quot;Lehrbuch der praktischen Physik&quot;; a more elementary work based on it being entitled &quot;Kleiner Leitfaden der praktischen Physik&quot;) and translated into English. It was considered the standard work on physical laboratory methods and measurements.

To this day, the textbook &quot;Praktische Physik&quot; (Practical Physics), which originated in Kohlrausch&#x27;s &quot;Leitfaden der praktischen Physik&quot;, is standard reading for physicists and engineers in Germany. This is attributable, above all, to the detailed descriptions provided of the measuring methods that form the basis of technical and experimental applications in many fields in physics.

Kohlrausch was also the author of &quot;Ueber den absoluten Leitungswiderstand des Quecksilbers&quot; (On the electrical resistance of mercury, 1888), and of many papers contributed to the &quot;Annalen der Physik und Chemie&quot;, and other scientific journals.

<text>Gavin King, better known by his stage name Aphrodite, is a British jungle and drum and bass DJ/producer on the Urban Takeover label. Also known as &quot;A Zone&quot; or DJ Aphro, he contributed to and influenced the genre&#x27;s styles and techniques. He was born in Aberystwyth, Wales, and moved to London with his family as a toddler. He has studied computer science. He was one half of breakbeat hardcore group Urban Shakedown (with Claudio Giussani) who scored a UK top 40 hit with &quot;Some Justice&quot;. The duo appeared in an article of Amiga Format magazine after using two Amiga 500 computers to help create the track.

DJ Aphrodite is behind Aphrodite Recordings which was inspired by a club he ran in 1988 called &#x27;Aphrodite&#x27;. His debut album was a self-titled effort under V2 Recordings, released in 1999. The follow-up was &quot;Aftershock&quot; which was again released under V2 Recordings on 24 June 2002.

<doc id="935066" wikidata="Q706678" url="?curid=935066" title="Lloyd Bacon">
<text>Lloyd Francis Bacon (December 4, 1889 – November 15, 1955) was an American screen, stage, and vaudeville actor and film director. As a director, he made films in virtually all genres, including westerns, musicals, comedies, gangster films, and crime dramas. He was one of the directors at Warner Bros. in the 1930s who helped give that studio its reputation for gritty, fast-paced &quot;torn from the headlines&quot; action films. And, in directing Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;42nd Street&quot;, he joined the movie&#x27;s song-and-dance-number director, Busby Berkeley, in contributing to &quot;an instant and enduring classic [that] transformed the musical genre&quot;.

==Early life==
Lloyd Bacon was born on December 4, 1889, in San Jose, California, the son of actor/playwright Frank Bacon - the co-author and star of the long-running Broadway show Lightnin&#x27; (1918) - and Jennie Weidman. Lloyd Bacon was not, contrary to some accounts, related to actor Irving Bacon, although he did direct him in a number of his films. Bacon attended Santa Clara University, and would later include highlights from the Bronco Football program in the end of his famous film, &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;. When America entered the First World War in 1917, Bacon enlisted in the United States Navy, and was assigned to the photographic department. Many of his later films as a director harked back fondly to his time in the Navy.

==Career==
Bacon started in films as an actor with Charlie Chaplin and Broncho Billy Anderson and appeared in more than 40 total. As an actor, he is best known for supporting Chaplin in such films as 1915&#x27;s &quot;The Tramp&quot; and &quot;The Champion&quot; and 1917&#x27;s &quot;Easy Street&quot;.

He later became a director and directed over 100 films between 1920 and 1955. He is best known as director of such classics as 1933&#x27;s &quot;42nd Street&quot; and &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;, 1937&#x27;s &quot;Ever Since Eve&quot; (from a screenplay by playwright Lawrence Riley &quot;et al&quot;.), 1938&#x27;s &quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot; with Edward G. Robinson, 1939&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Stripes&quot; with George Raft and Humphrey Bogart, 1939&#x27;s &quot;The Oklahoma Kid&quot; with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, 1940&#x27;s &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; with Pat O&#x27;Brien and Ronald Reagan (as &quot;the Gipper&quot;), 1943&#x27;s &quot;Action in the North Atlantic&quot; with Humphrey Bogart, and 1944&#x27;s &quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot; with Anne Baxter and Thomas Mitchell. He also directed &quot;Wake Up and Dream&quot; (1946).

==Death==
Bacon died on November 15, 1955, of a cerebral hemorrhage and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

At the time of his death, he was survived by his ex-wives, son, Frank (1937–2009) and daughter, Betsey.

For his contributions to the film industry, Bacon was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star in 1960. His star is located at 7011 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>OK Soda is a discontinued soft drink created in 1993 that courted the American Generation X demographic with unusual advertising tactics, including neo-noir design, chain letters and deliberately negative publicity. After the soda did not sell well in select test markets, it was officially declared out of production in 1995 before reaching nationwide distribution. The drink&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Things are going to be OK.&quot;

==History==
In 1993, Coca-Cola CEO Roberto Goizueta rehired Sergio Zyman to be the chief of marketing for all Coca-Cola beverage brands, a surprising choice given that Zyman had worked closely with the New Coke campaign, possibly the largest marketing failure in Coke&#x27;s history. However, after revamping the can design and print advertising campaigns for Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Classic with great success, Zyman was given free rein to design new products with aggressive, offbeat marketing campaigns.

International market research done by The Coca-Cola Company in the late 1980s revealed that &quot;Coke&quot; was the second most recognizable word across all languages in the world. The first word was &quot;OK&quot;. Zyman (who also conceived Fruitopia) decided to take advantage of this existing brand potential and created a soft drink with this name. He conceived of a counter-intuitive advertising campaign that intentionally targeted people who did not like advertising. He predicted that the soft drink would be a huge success, and promised Goizueta that the soft drink would take at least 4% of the US beverage market. Coca-Cola&#x27;s special projects manager Brian Lanahan explained to &quot;Time Magazine&quot; that they chose the name &quot;OK&quot; because &quot;It underpromises. It doesn&#x27;t say, &#x27;This is the next great thing.&#x27; It&#x27;s the flip side of overclaiming.&quot; Coca-Cola marketing consultant Tom Pinko told National Public Radio, &quot;People who are 19 years old are very accustomed to having been manipulated and knowing that they&#x27;re manipulated,&quot; and that OK Soda&#x27;s audience possessed a &quot;lethargy [that] probably can&#x27;t be penetrated by any commercial message.&quot;

===Testing===

Despite a US-wide advertising campaign and intense media attention, OK Soda was marketed only in select areas, representing different demographic areas during the summer of 1993. Four separate can designs were used (with each test market getting all four designs). The Coca-Cola Corporation announced at the time that they would continually update the cans with new designs (later designs can be identified by having an explanatory tag saying that it is &quot;A unique fruity soda&quot;). Some of the testing locations were:
* Atlantic Canada
* Austin, Texas
* Boston, Massachusetts
* Denver, Colorado
* Colorado Springs, Colorado
* Cincinnati, Ohio
* Detroit, Michigan
* Fargo, North Dakota
* Knoxville, Tennessee
* Little Rock, Arkansas
* Lynden, Washington
* Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota
* Northern Wisconsin
* Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
* Omaha, Nebraska
* Portland, Oregon
* Providence, Rhode Island
* Sacramento, California
* Seattle, Washington

OK Soda never captured more than 3% of the beverage market in any of the target locations, failing to match Zyman&#x27;s hype. The project was canceled by Coca-Cola just seven months after its kickoff, and the soft drink was never widely released to the public.

==Marketing==
OK Soda has been remembered more for its unique advertising campaign than for its fruity flavor. The name and advertising campaign attempted to poke fun at the &quot;I&#x27;m OK, You&#x27;re OK&quot; pop-psychology of the early 1970s. OK Soda was intentionally marketed at the difficult Generation X markets, and attempted to cash in on the group&#x27;s existing cynicism, disillusionment and disaffection with standard advertising campaigns. OK Soda&#x27;s concept was that the youth market was already aware that they were being manipulated by mass-media marketing, so this advertising campaign would just be more transparent about it. Its indirect advertising was a form of rebel advertising similar to the McDonald&#x27;s commercials for the Arch Deluxe. The campaign was designed by Portland, Oregon-based advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy. Spokespeople for the company and their advertisers were very frank about the fact that they were marketing the drink entirely on the &quot;feeling&quot; rather than the taste. OK Soda&#x27;s own advertisements went so far as to disparage the beverage&#x27;s taste comparing it to things like &quot;carbonated tree sap&quot;.

The general public did not respond to the offbeat campaign, and most critics point out that the campaigning was too overt in its courting of the youth and teen market.

===Can design===
Both the cans and the print advertisements for the soft drink, created by Wieden+Kennedy creative director Charlotte Moore, conceptual artist Peter Wegner, and designer Todd Waterbury, featured work by popular &quot;alternative&quot; cartoonists Daniel Clowes (&quot;Eightball&quot;, &quot;Ghost World&quot;) and Charles Burns (&quot;Black Hole&quot;, &quot;The Believer)&quot;, as well as work from illustrator Calef Brown. Though skeptical of the campaign, Clowes took the job because his work illustrating a couple of cans and a few posters paid more than publishing five books of comics. In an act of subverting OK Soda&#x27;s already subversive marketing scheme, Clowes gave his OK Soda mascot the facial features of Charles Manson, saying that none of the contracts he signed said, &quot;Don&#x27;t put a mass murderer on the can.&quot;

Unlike the brightly colored Coca-Cola cans, they were decorated in drab shades of gray, with occasional red text. In addition to the primarily two-tone illustrations, the cans featured a special code that could be entered at the toll-free number &quot;1-800-I-FEEL-OK&quot; that led callers through a series of true-or-false prompts inspired by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Cans also sported a &quot;Coincidence&quot; in the form of an odd OK Soda-themed urban legend set in various towns around the United States, each anecdote ending with the statement, &quot;This is a coincidence.&quot; OK Soda&#x27;s marketing team also mailed out these &quot;Coincidences&quot; in the form of chain letters to promote the soda, and in turn these chain letters were read on TV spots for OK Soda.

===Prize can===
Randomly included with OK Soda selections in vending machines was an OK Soda &quot;prize can&quot;. Similar to a can of instant soup, the top could be peeled completely off revealing the prize inside. Prizes included some form of OK Soda merchandise rolled to fit (usually a hat) and an additional two quarters to purchase another can of OK Soda. The design of the prize can was different from the others and represented a fifth design overall. It was also more cylindrical in shape, considerably lighter (without soda inside) and included a light-blue banner, the only such design to include this color. This program was similar to Coke&#x27;s previous MagiCan campaign.

===Manifesto===
Excerpts from the OK Soda manifesto, written by associate creative director Peter Wegner, were printed on the cans, and were also available for a short while on OK Soda&#x27;s website. Some of the sayings were:
*What&#x27;s the point of OK? Well, what&#x27;s the point of anything?
*OK Soda emphatically rejects anything that is not OK, and fully supports anything that is.
*The better you understand something, the more OK it turns out to be.
*OK Soda says, &quot;Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking there has to be a reason for everything.&quot;
*OK Soda reveals the surprising truth about people and situations.
*OK Soda does not subscribe to any religion, or endorse any political party, or do anything other than feel OK.
*There is no real secret to feeling OK.
*OK Soda may be the preferred drink of other people such as yourself.
*Never overestimate the remarkable abilities of &quot;OK&quot; brand soda.
*Please wake up every morning knowing that things are going to be OK.

==Composition and taste==
OK Soda had a more &quot;citric&quot; taste than traditional colas, almost like a fruit punch version of Coke&#x27;s Fresca. It has been described as &quot;slightly spicy&quot; and likened to a combination of orange soda and flat Coca-Cola.

===Ingredients===
Carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sucrose, citric acid, caramel color, potassium benzoate (to protect taste), phosphoric acid, acacia, natural flavors, potassium citrate, caffeine, dipotassium phosphate, glycerol ester of wood rosin, brominated vegetable oil, Red 40

==Legacy==
After its production ceased, OK Soda enjoyed a cult following on the internet, including the use of a newsgroup at alt.fan.ok-soda, which was fairly active for several years. Fans would reminisce about the offbeat advertising materials, sell merchandise and intact cans, and trade recipes for home-brewed OK Soda facsimiles.

While OK Soda appears on retrospective lists of failed soft drinks and fluke ad campaigns, Analyst Thomas Flight posits that OK Soda may have been &quot;ahead of its time&quot; in its attempts at &quot;brand disillusionment&quot; through its subversion of traditional marketing. For example, Liquid Death has used similar &quot;lifestyle play&quot; marketing techniques with great success. Meanwhile OK Soda&#x27;s original merchandise, cans and advertising material can still be found readily on eBay with asking prices sometimes in hundreds of U.S. dollars.

<text>Super Écran (French: &quot;Super Screen&quot;) is a Canadian French-language premium television network owned by Bell Media. It airs a mix of commercial-free films and television series. Films are primarily sourced from the United States and Canada, while the television series mostly consist of original series and programs from HBO and Showtime in the United States.

== History ==
Launched on February 1, 1983 under the name Premier Choix (French: &quot;First Choice&quot;), the channel was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to provide a national 24-hour-a-day French-language pay television network. It was owned and operated by First Choice Canadian Communications.

Premier Choix had a difficult time attracting enough subscribers, as did a regional Quebec-based pay-television network called TVEC which was licensed in November 1982. Rogers Cable in Toronto couldn&#x27;t add the channel until September 1983, and Videon Cable in Winnipeg didn&#x27;t have the additional channel capacity to add it until its dispute with Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS) over ownership of the cable plant was settled.

In the early years, before Réseau des sports and MusiquePlus were licensed, programming consisted of 70% movies and 30% sports.

TVEC (Télévision de l&#x27;Est du Canada Inc. (French: &quot;Eastern Canada Television Inc.&quot;)) was licensed in November 1982 as a regional French-language pay-TV channel from Quebec, serving Quebec, eastern Ontario, and Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick).

In February 1984 these two channels combined to form Super Écran.

In the late 1980s, Premier Choix: TVEC was awarded licenses for three additional specialty services, including Canal D and Le Canal Famille.

The network was granted authorization for national distribution across Canada in 1996.

On October 30, 2006, Astral Media launched an HD simulcast of Super Écran. Later, Astral launched HD feeds for all three remaining channels.

On March 4, 2013, the Competition Bureau approved the takeover of Astral Media by Bell Media. Bell filed a new application for the proposed takeover with the CRTC on March 6, 2013; the CRTC approved the merger on June 27, 2013.

On January 21, 2020, Bell announced that it would expand its subscription streaming service Crave into the French-language market on January 28, adding a selection of French-language content for all subscribers, as well as a premium Super Écran tier (equivalent to the &quot;Crave + Movies + HBO&quot; tier tied to Crave&#x27;s English-language linear service, formerly known as The Movie Network). With the changes, the Super Écran Go apps were discontinued, with subscribers being directed to the Crave app for TV Everywhere video on-demand access. This is not currently available to Vidéotron subscribers, as they have not yet reached a carriage agreement to allow use of the Crave app.

== Multiplexes and programming ==
Super Écran offers an extensive variety of Hollywood and Canadian movies, television series from HBO, Showtime and others distributors, and original content. Super Écran operates four multiplex channels, numbered from 1 to 4 in standard and high-definition. A video on demand service, &quot;Super Écran Sur Demande&quot;, was offered for digital cable and satellite subscribers, and &quot;Super Écran Go&quot;, a TV Everywhere platform for mobile and TV streaming set-top box, both featuring programming from the Super Écran channels. Go ceased operations on January 28, 2020, with their programming moving to the Crave platform while &quot;Sur Demande&quot; was only removed for Videotron Subscribers.

==International distribution==

<text>Ramsden is a lunar impact crater located on the western stretch of the Palus Epidemiarum. It was named after British instrument maker Jesse Ramsden. To the east-southeast is the crater Capuanus, and to the north lies Dunthorne.

The floor of the crater has been flooded with lava, and contains several small impact craters. The rim is somewhat oval and irregular in outline, with depressions at the north and south walls. It has a slight , but lacks s, a central peak, or a ray system.

The crater lies directly across a rille system named the Rimae Ramsden. These span an area 130 kilometers across, sprawling over the western Palus Epidemiarum. A branch reaches northwest to the Mare Nubium, passing between the craters Campanus and Mercator.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Ramsden.

<text>Eastnor Castle, Eastnor, Herefordshire, is a 19th-century mock castle. Eastnor was built for John Cocks, 1st Earl Somers, who employed Robert Smirke, later the main architect of the British Museum. 

The castle was built between 1811 and 1820. Major schemes of interior decoration were carried out by A.W.N. Pugin in 1849–1850. Eastnor remains a private home, and is currently the residence of James Hervey-Bathurst, the grandson of Arthur Somers-Cocks, 6th Baron Somers. It is a Grade I listed building. The surrounding gardens and parkland are designated Grade II*. 

==History==
The estate was established in the late 16th century when the Cocks family purchased land in the area. Subsequent marriages into the Somers and Nash families helped provide the wealth and substance necessary to build the present imposing building, designed to look like one of the medieval castles guarding the Welsh borders.

The castle was built to the designs of Robert Smirke in 1812–20. A.W.N. Pugin made some internal alterations – including the decoration of the Gothic drawing room – in 1849–50, and George E. Fox made further changes in the 1860s. It is constructed of ashlar stonework, with a lead and slate roof concealed behind an embattled parapet. Cast-iron was used for the roof trusses and floor beams. It was constructed at a cost of £85,000, the equivalent of approximately £5.1 million at 2024 prices.

The castle was criticised by Charles Locke Eastlake later in the 19th century: 
It is a massive and gloomy-looking building, flanked by watch-towers, and enclosing a keep. To preserve the character at which it aimed, the windows were made exceedingly small and narrow. This must have resulted in much inconvenience within...The building in question might have made a tolerable fort before the invention of gunpowder, but as a residence it was a picturesque mistake.

The castle still has an operating flour mill, &quot;one of the oldest in the county&quot;, built in the 18th century as Clencher&#x27;s. In the 21st century, the water supply was &quot;reinstated and the machinery overhauled so it is now workable&quot;. As of 2020, the family occupied only a small part of the castle, &quot;smaller rooms, and we mostly live in the kitchen, which was enlarged in 1992&quot;, according to James Hervey-Bathurst, who inherited the property from his mother, the Hon. Mrs Elizabeth Hervey-Bathurst, in 1988.

The castle&#x27;s business was affected for some time in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but by mid-July 2020, restrictions were easing. The ironwork bridge over the weir, first installed in 1828, was reopened after restoration in 2021. The castle is open to tours by the public on certain months of the year; it is also a wedding venue.

==Eastnor Obelisk==
In 1812 John Somers-Cocks, 2nd Earl Somers commissioned the construction of an obelisk on the Eastnor estate, to honour various members of his family. The architect was almost certainly Robert Smirke. Family members commemorated with plaques on the monument include John Somers, 1st Baron Somers, who served William III as Lord Chancellor, and Edward Charles Cocks, who was an intelligence officer on the Duke of Wellington’s staff and died during the Siege of Burgos in the Peninsular War in 1812. The obelisk is situated in Eastnor Deer Park just over a mile away from the castle, and is now a Grade II* listed building.

==Media appearances and events==
The car manufacturer Land Rover uses the Eastnor estate as a venue for potential customers to test-drive their vehicles. The castle has been used as a location for various films, television programmes and music videos, including &quot;One More Time&quot;, starring Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr, the Slade video &quot;Run Runaway&quot;, the 1986 film adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, the BBC TV adaptation of Little Lord Fauntleroy in 1995, the American reality competition programme &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, ITV&#x27;s 2015 adaptation of &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot;, and two episodes of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Succession&quot;.

<text>The , also known as Capcom Play System 2 or CPS-2, is an arcade system board that Capcom first used in 1993 for &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;. It was the successor to their previous CP System, CP System Dash and Capcom Power System Changer arcade hardware and was succeeded by the CP System III hardware in 1996, of which the CPS-2 would outlive by over four years. The arcade system had new releases for it until the end of 2003, ending with &quot;Hyper Street Fighter II&quot;. Technical support for the CPS-2 ended on February 28, 2019.

==History==

Capcom announced the development of the CP System II (or CPS-2) in 1990. They had planned to complete and release the CP System II hardware in 18 months. They also originally had plans for the system to be capable of 3D graphics.

The earlier Capcom system board, the original CP System (or CPS-1), while successful, was very vulnerable to bootleggers making unauthorized copies of games. In order to rectify the situation, Capcom took the CP System hardware (with QSound) with minimal changes and employed encryption on the program ROMs to prevent software piracy. Due to the encryption, the system was never bootlegged until unencrypted program data became available.

The CP System II consists of two separate parts; the &quot;A&quot; board, which connects to the JAMMA harness and contains components common between all CP System II games, and the &quot;B&quot; board, which contains the game itself. The relationship between the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; board is very similar to that between a home video game console and cartridge. CP System II &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; boards are color-coded by region, and each board can only be used with its same-colored mate. The exception to this is that the blue and green boards can be used together.

The &quot;B&quot; boards hold battery-backed memory containing decryption keys needed for the games to run. As time passes, these batteries lose their charge and the games stop functioning, because the CPU cannot execute any code without the decryption keys. This is generally referred to as a &quot;suicide battery&quot;. It is possible to bypass the original battery and swap it out with a new one in-circuit, but this must be done before the original falls below 2V or the keys will be lost. Consequently, the board would just simply die, even if used legally it would not play after a finite amount of time unless a fee was paid to Capcom to replace it.

Due to the heavy encryption, it was believed for a long time that CP System II emulation was next to impossible. However, in January 2001, the CPS-2 Shock group was able to obtain unencrypted program data by hacking into the hardware, which they distributed as XOR difference tables to produce the unencrypted data from the original ROM images, making emulation possible, as well as restoring cartridges that had been erased because of the suicide system.

In January 2007, the encryption method was fully reverse-engineered by Andreas Naive () and Nicola Salmoria. It has been determined that the encryption employs two four-round Feistel ciphers with a 64-bit key. The algorithm was thereafter implemented in this state for all known CPS-2 games in MAME.

In April 2016, Eduardo Cruz, Artemio Urbina and Ian Court announced the successful reverse engineering of Capcom&#x27;s CP System II security programming, enabling the clean &quot;de-suicide&quot; and restoration of any dead games without hardware modifications.

Capcom ceased manufacturing the CP System II hardware on December 22, 2003, with &quot;Hyper Street Fighter II&quot; being the final game released for the hardware. Capcom ended most of the technical support for the hardware and its games on March 31, 2015. Battery replacements ended on February 28, 2019, ending all official support of the CP System II hardware and software.

<doc id="935095" wikidata="Q175368" url="?curid=935095" title="Regiomontanus (crater)">
<text>Regiomontanus is an ancient lunar impact crater located in the southern highlands region to the southeast of Mare Nubium. It is joined at the chaotic northern rim by the crater Purbach, and to the south-southeast is Walther.

==Characteristics==
The crater is heavily worn from impact erosion, and the rim is irregular, mountainous and distinctly oval in outline. The walls on the southern and western edges have been almost completely degraded. A prominent ridge lies off-center to the northwest, with the small crater Regiomontanus A at its summit. The crater floor is lava-flooded, and has a number of small crater impacts.

The summit crater Regiomontanus A was once considered proof of volcanic activity on the Moon. However this feature is actually an impact crater, and is offset slightly from the summit of the central peak.

==Name==
Regiomontanus is named after the 15th century German astronomer and mathematician Johannes Müller von Königsberg, known as Regiomontanus. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Christinae Reg. Suec.&quot; after Christina, Queen of Sweden. And Johannes Hevelius grouped it with Purbach and Walther as &quot;Mons Libanus&quot; after Mount Lebanon.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Regiomontanus.

<text>Alex Reece (born Alexander Reece, from England, West London Borough Ealing is a drum and bass musician. He popularized the use of two-step breaks in drum and bass, and was an influence of the jazzstep sound, a mix of drum and bass and jazz. Reece was one of the musicians in the Metalheadz collective, and has also worked under the pseudonym of Fallen Angels.

==Career==
Reece began DJing in the late 1980s. In 1992, Jack Smooth offered Reece a trainee studio engineer job, and Reece went on to engineer for Smooth on many of the early Basement Records releases. Reece first tried house (recording with his brother, Oscar, under the name of XE-DUS), but graduated to drum and bass. Though his preferred genres were acid house and Detroit techno, Reece become known for jungle music in the mid-1990s. 

His initial releases appeared on Liquid Wax with DJ Phantasy under The Reece Project, Basement Records and Creative Wax labels. However, Reece made his name with Goldie&#x27;s MetalHeadz Records with the single releases &quot;Basic Principles&quot; (1994) and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1995). They became jungle standards, standing out for their minimal approach. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was released in 1995 as a single on MetalHeadz, his surname was incorrectly listed as &quot;Reese&quot; on the first batch. Fabio was thinking of releasing on his new label Creative Source, but delays with that lend to it going to MetalHeadz label.

&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was also later released on an album by Goldie, again on his MetalHeadz label, preventing Reece from putting it out on his own album &quot;So Far&quot; on the label, 4th &amp; Broadway. Instead Reece produced a remake of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; called &quot;Pulp Friction&quot;, released in 1996. The two-step break and Reese Bassline used in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; became Drum and Bass Standards.

Reece cemented his reputation with additional recordings as Jazz Juice, from 1995, with Paul Saunders (for Precious Materials), Lunar Funk (for Mo&#x27;Wax), and the Original Playboy (for R&amp;S). In early 1995, Reece secured a recording contract when Island Records recruited him for their Quango subsidiary. His debut album, &quot;So Far&quot; was released in September 1996 with 2 singles being previously released from his So Far album Feel the Sunshine&quot; in December 1995 making introductory Drum and Bass chart success and &quot;Candles&quot; released in 1996 all produced at his studio &quot;Acid Lab&quot; these were released under the Fourth &amp; Broadway banner with real commercial success. He is now back working on new drum and bass music with his brother Stewart Reece under the Metalheadz label.

<doc id="935107" wikidata="Q1034233" url="?curid=935107" title="CP System">
<text>The , also known as Capcom Play System, CPS for short, and retroactively as CPS-1, is an arcade system board developed by Capcom that ran game software stored on removable daughterboards. More than two dozen arcade titles were released for CPS-1, before Capcom shifted game development over to its successor, the CP System II. Technical support for the CPS-1 ended on March 31, 2015.

Among the 33 titles produced for the system, the CP System is known for its many beat &#x27;em up titles such as &quot;Dynasty Wars&quot;, &quot;Final Fight&quot;, &quot;The King of Dragons&quot;, &quot;Captain Commando&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Round&quot;, &quot;Warriors of Fate&quot;, &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot;, and &quot;The Punisher&quot;. It is also known for its famous fighting games such as &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and &quot;Muscle Bomber&quot;.

==History==
After a number of arcade game boards designed to run only one game, Capcom embarked upon a project to produce a system board that could be used to run multiple games, in order to reduce hardware costs and make the system more appealing to arcade operators.

Capcom began developing the CPS hardware around 1986, when Capcom president Kenzo Tsujimoto came up with the concept inspired by the success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). He saw the rise of home video games as competition for the arcades, so said the &quot;only way we can make money is to give people twice what they can get at home&quot;.

Capcom developed the CPS hardware for about two-and-a-half years, during which time they developed two custom microchips that they called the CPS Super Chips, equivalent to the power of ten normal arcade printed circuit boards (PCBs) at the time. The two chips cost £5,500,000 or to develop.

The system was plagued by many bootleg versions of its games. In particular, there were so many bootleg versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; that they were more common in some countries than the official version. This problem was virtually eliminated by Capcom in the later CP System II.

The CP System hardware was also utilized in Capcom&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt at home console market penetration, the Capcom Power System Changer (or CPS Changer), a domestic version of the CP System similar to the Neo Geo AES.

Capcom ceased production of the CP System hardware on May 11, 1995; however, new software continued to be released for the hardware as late as 2000. Capcom ended technical support for the CP System hardware and its games on March 31, 2015.

==CP System Dash==

A year before releasing the CP System II, Capcom released an enhanced version of the original CP System dubbed the CP System Dash, which had some features that would later be used in the CP System II, such as the QSound chips. The CP System Dash boards have four interlocking PCBs contained in gray plastic boxes. The concept of arcade PCBs encased in a special plastic enclosure would later be reused for the CP System II hardware.

To combat piracy, &quot;suicide batteries&quot; were implemented, which power the volatile RAM which contained the manual configuration of the display hardware registers, as well as the priorities registers. If the batteries&#x27; voltage drops below +2V, the registers manually defined in factory by Capcom in RAM would be lost, and the PPU would no longer have access to the hardware specific register set on the game used. This renders the game inoperable, necessitating the operator sending the board to Capcom to be fixed at their own expense. Unlike the CP System II, the CP System Dash sound ROMs were encrypted using &quot;Kabuki&quot; Z80s. The CP System Dash 68000 code is not encrypted at all.

==Capcom Power System Changer==

A home version of the CP System, the Capcom Power System Changer (or CPS Changer), was released in late 1994 in Japan to compete against SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo. It was Capcom&#x27;s attempt at selling their arcade games in a home-friendly format. 

The CPS Changer was sold as a package deal containing the console itself, one CPS Fighter joystick controller, and &quot;Street Fighter II (Dash) Turbo&quot; for 39,800 yen. Additional games were sold for about 20,000 yen. Upon its launch in November 1994, Capcom initially manufactured only 1,000 units in Japan.

The CPS Changer&#x27;s adapter was basically an encased SuperGun (i.e. Television JAMMA adapter), and was compatible with most JAMMA standard PCBs. Capcom&#x27;s &quot;protection&quot; against people using the CPS Changer on other arcade boards was the physical shape of the device. On a normal JAMMA PCB, it would not attach firmly and would lean at odd angles, but it would work. The CPS Changer has outputs for composite video, S-video and line-level mono audio. The CPS Changer also featured Super Famicom/Super NES controller ports, allowing the use of all Super Famicom/Super NES controllers, including their own six-button joystick, the &quot;CPS Fighter&quot;.

All of the CPS Changer games used the CP System arcade hardware. The CPS Changer games were simply arcade PCBs in a special plastic shell suitable for home use. This concept had already been done with the CP System II hardware a year prior. The plastic shells are identical to that of CP System Dash games. Some CPS-1 games were changed slightly for home release, sometimes including debugging features or other easter eggs.

The final game for the CPS Changer was a back-ported version of &quot;Street Fighter Zero&quot; (also known as &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;) in 1995, originally released for the CP System II hardware. This special CPS Changer version, released at a premium 35,000 yen in 1996, was degraded slightly for the older hardware: it had fewer frames of animation for the game characters, fewer onscreen colors, a different sounding soundtrack with less sound effects, as well as the sound and music effects being sampled at a lower rate. This release was also available in limited quantities overseas in the arcades for publicity testing purposes, including those that couldn&#x27;t afford the upgrade to the CP System II hardware.

Around the same time the CPS Changer version of &quot;Street Fighter Zero&quot; was being developed, a back-ported version of &quot;Rockman: The Power Battle/Mega Man: The Power Battle&quot; (originally released for the CP System II hardware that same year) also appeared. It was not released for the CPS Changer, however (especially since &quot;Street Fighter Zero&quot; was the last title released for the CPS Changer); instead, it was made as a standard CP System release. Like the CPS Changer version of &quot;Street Fighter Zero&quot;, this version has several differences to accommodate the older hardware, which included among others, a different sounding-soundtrack and lower-sampled sound effects. Similar to the CPS Changer version of &quot;Street Fighter Zero&quot;, it was also released in limited quantities overseas for publicity testing purposes, especially for those who couldn&#x27;t afford to upgrade to the CP System II hardware. This version is included in &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot; and &quot;Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium&quot;.

<text>The Turnmills building was a warehouse originally on the corner of Turnmill Street and Clerkenwell Road in the London Borough of Islington. It became a bar in the 1980s, then a nightclub. The club closed in 2008 and the building was later demolished, replaced with an office building.

== History==
The Victorian building opened in 1886 and was originally used as a warehouse and stables by the Great Northern Railway Company. The building later became a warehouse for Booth&#x27;s Dry Gin distillery before changing hands in 1985 and becoming a bar. The Clerkenwell area was well known for its gin distilleries during the Victorian era. Gordon&#x27;s Gin distillery was originally sited in Goswell Road/Moreland Street, EC1, not far from Turnmills.

In a bid to try to save the building from demolition, various objections were put forward to Islington Council. William Palin, secretary of Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage, said that &quot;It may not be as architecturally stunning as the Sessions House across the road but it’s a really good-quality commercial and industrial building. It’s a good example of an old building that’s been successfully re-used in a number of ways.&quot;

Although English Heritage argued that the building possessed historic and aesthetic value, the building was finally deemed not to be of considerable significance to be saved from the wrecking ball. The building finally closed on 24 March 2008.

==Club==
In 1985 John Newman purchased the lease on the building and opened a bar/restaurant on the site. In 1990, the venue evolved into a nightclub. The first successful club night held at Turnmills was &quot;Xanadu,&quot; run and co-hosted by London club promoters Robert Pereno and Laurence Malice.

The venue was the first to obtain a 24-hour alcohol licence in the UK, spearheading the move to all-night clubbing in the 1990s and became the home of several club nights including &quot;Trade&quot;, the first legal after-hours club in Britain.

== Closure ==
On 24 January 2008, Danny Newman announced the building would close on 23 March 2008 as a clubbing venue, due to the expiry of the lease on the building.
The building was later demolished and a new office building (despite objections) was built in its place. Publicis Sapient are now located in the new building.

<doc id="935117" wikidata="Q644906" url="?curid=935117" title="Thebit (crater)">
<text>Thebit is a lunar impact crater located on the southeast shore of Mare Nubium. To the north-northwest is the crater Arzachel, and Purbach lies to the south-southwest. To the southwest is the flooded remnants of Thebit P, which is actually larger in diameter than Thebit itself.

The rim of Thebit is generally circular in outline, with a double-notch in the southwest wall. A prominent bowl-shaped crater, Thebit A, lies across the west-northwestern rim. The west-northwestern rim of this crater is overlain in turn by the even smaller Thebit L. Together this forms an elegant arrangement that makes Thebit relatively simple to identify. The floor of Thebit crater is rough and has no central peak. The rim displays a , and has a hilly outer .

Due west of Thebit is a 110-kilometer-long ridge named Rupes Recta, which rises to 240 meters. This linear feature runs north-northwest to south-southeast across the Mare Nubium.

Thebit is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Name==
Thebit is a Latinization of the name of the 9th century Iraqi astronomer and mathematician Thābit ibn Qurra.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Thebit.

==Ancient Thebit==
Thebit lies on the eastern rim of a much older, 220-km diameter crater informally known as &quot;Ancient Thebit.&quot; Its eroded rim is still present to the northwest and southwest of Thebit, and unnamed wrinkle ridges in Mare Nubium may correlate with the western rim that is now buried by mare lava. The Rupes Recta, Birt, and Rima Birt are all within Ancient Thebit.

<text>Aquasky is an English electronic group composed of Dave Wallace, Kieron Bailey, and Brent Newitt. In early 1995 they got together to produce their own music. Shortly afterwards they sent a demo tape to Moving Shadow records and the seeds of a musical alliance were sown. The first single &#x27;Dezires / Images&#x27; (Shadow 64) was released three months later and remixed by Krust (Shadow 64R).

Originally a drum and bass outfit, the trio have also become involved in the breaks scene using the moniker Aquasky vs. Masterblaster to denote their breaks projects. They retained Aquasky for drum and bass projects. The addition of Masterblaster however led to great confusion amongst fans. So Masterblaster was dropped and everything is once again being released under the name Aquasky. The trio are also responsible for creating and running the Passenger label established in 1997 (as well as its sister label 777 established in 2004) which continues to release their style of heavy drum and bass influenced breaks. Their latest effort is the &#x27;Teamplayers&#x27; EP which features collaborations with many influential electronic artists including The Breakfastaz, Tayo, The Ragga Twins and Meat Katie.

The trio now operate under the name &quot;Black Noise&quot; releasing electro house songs for &quot;Southern Fried Records&quot;

<doc id="935120" wikidata="Q2634041" url="?curid=935120" title="CP System III">
<text>The or CPS-3 is an arcade system board that was first used by Capcom in 1996 with the arcade game &quot;Red Earth&quot;. It was the second successor to the CP System arcade hardware, following the CP System II. The arcade system saw new releases up until mid 1999. Technical support for the CPS-3 ended on February 28, 2019. It would be the last proprietary system board Capcom would produce before moving on to the Dreamcast-based Naomi platform.

Like its forerunners, games can be exchanged without altering the core hardware. This is accomplished on the CPS-3 by providing the necessary CD and game-specific security cartridges, where the contents of the CD are then loaded into memory with the security cartridge decrypting the contents stored within the system memory in run time.

==History==
The CP System III became the final arcade system board to be designed by Capcom. It features a security mechanism; games are supplied on a CD, which contains the encrypted game contents, and a security cartridge containing the game BIOS and the SH-2 CPU with integrated decryption logic, with the per-game key stored in battery-backed SRAM. Capcom chose the CD medium in order to keep down the price of the system.

In a change from its predecessors, the CP System III consists of a single board instead of two separate boards. The board contains components common to all CP System III games, and includes a slot for the security cartridge. The games themselves are stored on a CD instead of on a separate board, which is then readable by the provided SCSI CD-ROM drive that is connected to the main board. A unique feature of the CP System III is the ability to display games in widescreen, making it the first and only proprietary system board made by Capcom to include this feature. It was only officially used in one game, &quot;Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact&quot;.

When the CP System III board is first powered on, the contents of the CD are loaded into a bank of Flash ROM SIMMs on the motherboard, where it is executed. The program code is then decrypted at run time via the security cartridge. The security cartridge is sensitive to any sort of tampering, which will result in the decryption key being erased and the cartridge being rendered useless. Games become unplayable when the security cartridge has been tampered with or when the battery inside the security cartridge dies. The lone exception is &quot;Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact&quot;, which uses a default set of decryption keys that are written to dead cartridges on boot, making it the few, if not the only CPS-3 games prevalent after support was dropped, due to its immunity to cartridge tampering or suicide.

In June 2007, the encryption method was reverse-engineered by Andreas Naive, making emulation possible. Later developments led to the eventual bypassing of the suicide and security routines of the games as well as a development of a so-called &quot;super cartridge&quot; capable of running all CPS-3 games.

Capcom ceased manufacturing the CP System III hardware after 1999. Capcom ended most of the technical support for the hardware and its games on March 31, 2015. Battery replacements ended on February 28, 2019, ending all official support of the CP System III hardware and software.

<doc id="935129" wikidata="Q541596" url="?curid=935129" title="John Moisant">
<text>John Bevins Moisant (April 25, 1868 – December 31, 1910) was an American aviator, aeronautical engineer, flight instructor, businessman, and revolutionary. He was the first pilot to conduct passenger flights over a city (Paris), as well as across the English Channel, from Paris to London. He co-founded an eponymous flying circus, the Moisant International Aviators.

Moisant funded his aviation career with proceeds from business ventures in El Salvador, where he had led two failed revolutions and coup attempts against President Figueroa in 1907 and 1909.

Only months after becoming a pilot, Moisant died after being ejected from his airplane over a field just west of New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was competing for the 1910 Michelin Cup. The site of his crash is the location of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, which was originally named Moisant Field in his memory.

==Early life==
He was born in L&#x27;Erable, Illinois to Medard Moisant (1838–1887) of St-Cyprien-de-Léry and Josephine Fortier (1841–1901). Both parents were French-Canadian immigrants. His siblings include: George Moisant (1866–1927); Ann Marguerite Moisant (1877–1957); Matilde Moisant (1878–1964) who was the second American woman to receive her pilot&#x27;s license; Alfred J. Moisant (1862–1929); Louisa Josephine Moisant (1882–1957); and possibly Eunice Moisant (1890–?) who was born in Illinois. Alfred and Matilde were also aviators.

In 1880, the family was living in Manteno, Illinois and Moisant&#x27;s father was working as a farmer. In the late 1880s, after the death of Moisant&#x27;s father, the family moved to Alameda, California.

==El Salvador==
He and his brothers moved to El Salvador in 1896 and bought sugarcane plantations that generated a substantial sum for the family. In 1909, José Santos Zelaya, president of Nicaragua, asked John to go to France to investigate airplanes.

==Aviation career==

===Early aeronautical engineering===

John Moisant entered the aviation field in 1909 as a hobby, after attending the Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation de la Champagne air show in Reims, France in August 1909. He designed and built two aircraft between August 1909 and 1910, before he became an officially licensed pilot. His first was the Moisant Biplane, alternatively known as &quot;L&#x27;Ecrevisse&quot;, which he had built in Issy-les-Moulineaux, Paris, France. This experimental aircraft constructed entirely from aluminum and steel by workers hired by Moisant from Clément-Bayard was the first all-metal aircraft in the world. This aircraft was completed in February 1910; the Moisant biplane&#x27;s inaugural flight, and Moisant first flight, ultimately resulted in a crash after ascending only 90 feet with limited airtime.

Moisant&#x27;s second project, begun in January 1910, resulted in the Moisant Monoplane, alternatively known as &quot;Le Corbeau&quot;, which was partially built out of the wreckage of L&#x27;Ecrevisse. The alternative design had difficulty staying upright on the ground and was never flown.

===Training in France===

In the spring of 1910, Moisant took four flying lessons at the Blériot School, headed by Louis Blériot, in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France, beginning his short but distinguished flying career. Later, Moisant was granted a pilot&#x27;s license from the Aéro-Club de France, which he transferred to the Aero Club of America to become the thirteenth registered pilot in the United States.

===Significant flights and aviation records===
On August 9, 1910, Moisant flew his third flight as a pilot in his first recently purchased Blériot XI from Étampes to Issy-les-Moulineaux over Paris, landing the aircraft at the starting line of the Le Circuit de l&#x27;Est aerial time trial circuit. Accompanying Moisant as a passenger on the flight was his mechanic, making the trip the first passenger flight over a city in the world. At the time Moisant was still considered a novice pilot and had been previously denied entry into Le Circuit de l&#x27;Est competition by the Aéro-Club de France. That same day, he followed this performance with an encore, flying over Paris again with Roland Garros, who would become a future member of the Moisant International Aviators flying circus, as his passenger.

On August 17, 1910, he flew the first flight with a passenger across the English Channel. His passengers on the flight were Albert Fileux, his mechanic, and his cat, Mademoiselle Fifi. This feat was accomplished on Moisant&#x27;s sixth flight as a pilot.

===Competitive events===
At the International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park, New York, John Moisant flew his Blériot XI around a marker balloon 10 miles (16 kilometers) away, and returned to the racetrack in only 39 minutes, winning an $850 prize. After this initial competition, Moisant collided his brake-less Blériot into another aircraft while both were taxiing, causing it to flip over, but had repairs completed in time for the next event. On October 30, 1910, at the same show, he competed in a race to fly around the Statue of Liberty. He won the race, beating Claude Grahame-White, a British aviator, by 42.75 seconds. However, he was later disqualified because officials ruled that he had started late. The $10,000 prize later went to Count Jacques de Lesseps not Grahame-White, because the latter had fouled during the race.

On December 30, 1910, in New Orleans, he raced his Blériot XI five miles (eight kilometers) against a Packard automobile, but lost.

===Entrepreneurship: the Moisant International Aviators===
With his brother, Alfred Moisant, he formed the Moisant International Aviators, a flying circus which went barnstorming around the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. Initially, John Moisant was one of the pilots in the exhibitions, along with Charles K. Hamilton, Rene Simon, Rene Barrier, J.J. Frisbie, C. Audemars, and Roland Garros.

==Death==
Moisant died on the morning of December 31, 1910, in an air crash near Harahan, Louisiana. He was making a preparatory flight in his attempt to win the 1910 Michelin Cup and its $4,000 prize for the longest sustained flight of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;T-P 1/1/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While attempting to land at an airfield in Harahan, located about four miles from the New Orleans city limits, Moisant was caught in a gust of wind and thrown from his Blériot XI monoplane in view of a crowd of spectators. He fell about 25 feet to the ground and landed on his head, breaking his neck. Apparently still alive, Moisant&#x27;s body was hurriedly placed aboard a nearby railroad car and driven into the city, where he was then pronounced dead. The crash was later blamed on a &quot;loss of equilibrium caused by an extra load of gasoline, placed aboard the plane for the endurance flight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;T-P 11/18/41&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow aviator Arch Hoxsey died the same day in a similar crash in Los Angeles.

John Moisant was buried at the Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. His body was later moved to the Portal of Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation, also in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==

John Moisant was one of the first to advocate for monoplanes with one set of fixed wings. Additionally, he believed in the potential of the use of aircraft in armed conflict.

Moisant&#x27;s touring show was among the first in aviation, and one of the first to introduce Americans to airplanes.

===Cessna===
Among the people influenced by Moisant&#x27;s exhibitions was aviation pioneer Clyde Cessna, who saw the Moisant troupe&#x27;s 1911 performance in Oklahoma City. Cessna helped uncrate and assemble, then disassemble and re-crate, a Blériot XI monoplane used in the show. From his memory of that activity, Cessna built his first airplane—the first airplane built and flown successfully on the Great Plains by a resident... and the first of hundreds of thousands of airplanes, worldwide, that would bear the &quot;Cessna&quot; name.
Cessna would become one of the United States&#x27; first major advocates of monoplanes, carrying forward Moisant&#x27;s support of the then-controversial concept.

According to some historical accounts (reportedly later disputed by Cessna, himself), Cessna went to the Queen Aeroplane Company in New York, and worked in their factory for a month, learning the art of construction of Bleriot-type monoplanes. According to these accounts, when Moisant was killed, Cessna purchased a Queen/Bleriot fuselage that was being assembled at the Queen factory for Moisant—and that became the basis for Cessna&#x27;s first airplane.

===Moisant Field===
The international airport of New Orleans, Louisiana was originally named Moisant Field in his honor, though it has since been renamed Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. The airport retains its &quot;MSY&quot; identifier, thought to be derived from &quot;Moisant Stock Yards&quot;, and is located in suburban Kenner, only a few miles from the field where Moisant&#x27;s fatal airplane crash occurred.

<doc id="935134" wikidata="Q946745" url="?curid=935134" title="Broncho Billy Anderson">
<text>Gilbert M. &quot;Broncho Billy&quot; Anderson (born Maxwell Henry Aronson; March 21, 1880 – January 20, 1971) was an American actor, writer, film director, and film producer, who was the first star of the Western film genre. He was a founder and star for Essanay studios. In 1958, he received a special Academy Award for being a pioneer of the film industry.

==Early life==
Anderson was born Maxwell Henry Aronson in Little Rock, Arkansas, the sixth child of Henry and Esther (Ash) Aronson, both natives of New York. His younger sister was actress and singer Leona Anderson. His family was Jewish, his father&#x27;s parents having emigrated to the United States from Prussia, and his mother&#x27;s from the Russian Empire. His family moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas when he was three years old. He lived in Pine Bluff until he was 8, when he moved with his family to St. Louis, Missouri. When he was 18, he moved to New York City and appeared in vaudeville and the theater, supplementing his income as a photographer&#x27;s model and newspaper vendor. In 1903, he met Edwin S. Porter, who hired him as an actor and occasional script collaborator.

==Film==
Anderson played the dancing tenderfoot and the train passenger who gets shot and bandit #1 in &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903). Seeing the film for the first time at a vaudeville theater and being overwhelmed by the audience&#x27;s reaction, he decided to work in the film industry exclusively. He began to write, direct, and act in his own Westerns under the name Gilbert M. Anderson.
In 1907 in Chicago, Anderson and George Kirke Spoor founded Essanay Studios (&quot;S and A&quot; for Spoor and Anderson), one of the major early movie studios. In 1909, he directed the film with the first known instance of the pie-the-face gag, &quot;Mr. Flip&quot;. Anderson acted in over 300 short films. He played a wide variety of characters, but he gained enormous popularity from a series of 148 silent Western shorts and was the first film cowboy star, &quot;Broncho Billy.&quot; Many of these were shot in Niles, a small town in Alameda County, California, south-east of San Francisco, where the nearby Western Pacific Railroad route through Niles Canyon proved to be a very suitable location for the filming of Westerns.

Writing, acting, and directing most of these movies, Anderson also found time to direct a series of &quot;Alkali Ike&quot; comedy Westerns starring Augustus Carney. In 1916, Anderson sold his ownership in Essanay and retired from acting. He returned to New York City, bought the Longacre Theatre and produced plays, but without permanent success. He then made a brief comeback as a producer with a series of shorts with Stan Laurel, including his first work with Oliver Hardy in &quot;A Lucky Dog&quot; (filmed in 1919, released in 1921). After a series of failures as a Broadway producer, he retired again after 1920, this time permanently.

Anderson sued Paramount Pictures for naming a character &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; in &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1943) and for depicting the character as a &quot;washed-up and broken-down actor,&quot; which he felt reflected badly on him. He asked for $900,000, but the outcome of the suit is unknown.

In 1958, Anderson received an Honorary Academy Award as a &quot;motion picture pioneer&quot; for his &quot;contributions to the development of motion pictures as entertainment.&quot;

At age 85, Anderson came out of retirement for a cameo role in &quot;The Bounty Killer&quot; (1965).

==Personal life and death==
For the last years of his life, Anderson lived at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. In his later years, his legs were paralyzed as the result of a back injury that occurred while he was making a film.

He died of a heart attack in 1971 at the age of 90, at a Braewood sanitarium in South Pasadena, California.

==Legacy==
In 1918, Albert Levering drew a celebrity comic, &quot;Broncho Billy&quot;, based on the Hollywood western star. 

Anderson was honored posthumously in 1998 with his image on a U.S. postage stamp. In 2002, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. For the past nine years, Niles (now part of Fremont), California, site of the western Essanay Studios, has held an annual &quot;Broncho Billy Silent Film Festival.&quot;

Anderson has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1651 Vine Street in Hollywood.

A Chicago Park District park, not far from the site of the Chicago Essanay Studio lot, was named Broncho Billy Park in his honor.

On March 21, 2018, a historical roadside marker was dedicated in Little Rock, Arkansas, across the street from his birthplace, 713 Center Street. The marker was donated by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation in cooperation with the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum and Little Rock&#x27;s First United Methodist Church.

<doc id="935138" wikidata="Q2415420" url="?curid=935138" title="Ann Rule">
<text>Ann Rae Rule (&quot;née&quot; Stackhouse; October 22, 1931 – July 26, 2015) was an American author of true crime books and articles. She is best known for &quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot; (1980), about the serial killer Ted Bundy, with whom Rule worked and whom she considered a friend, but was later revealed to be a murderer. Rule wrote over 30 true crime books, including &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot;, about Oregon child murderer Diane Downs. Many of Rule&#x27;s books center on murder cases that occurred in the Pacific Northwest and her adopted home state of Washington.

== Early life and education ==

Ann Rae Stackhouse was born on October 22, 1931, in Lowell, Michigan. She was one of two children of Sophie Marie (Hansen) and Chester R. Stackhouse. Her mother was a teacher, specializing in developmentally disabled children, and her father was a football and track and field coach. As Rule did during young adulthood, her family members had careers in law enforcement. Rule&#x27;s grandfather and uncle were sheriffs in Michigan. Another uncle was a medical examiner and a cousin was a prosecutor. Rule spent summers with her grandparents doing volunteer work at the local jail.

She graduated from Coatesville High School in Chester County, Pennsylvania and later earned an associate degree from Highline Community College in Des Moines, Washington. Rule also attended the University of Washington, studying creative writing, criminology and psychology.

== Career ==
Rule&#x27;s career path included working as a law enforcement officer for the Seattle Police Department as well as writing for publications geared toward women. Beginning in 1969, she wrote for &quot;True Detective&quot; magazine under the pen name &quot;Andy Stack&quot;.

While volunteering at a suicide crisis hotline center in Seattle in 1971, Rule met Ted Bundy, a work-study student who was studying psychology at the University of Washington. After Bundy moved to Utah for law school, he was arrested in 1975 for kidnapping a young woman and later identified as a serial murderer with an unknown number of victims dating to at least 1974 if not earlier. During the time they worked together, Rule observed nothing disturbing in Bundy&#x27;s personality, and saw him as &quot;kind, solicitous, and empathetic&quot;. 

Her first book, &quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot;, is considered one of the most definitive biographies of Bundy. First published in 1980, the year Bundy was convicted of murder, the book was written under her own name rather than the pen name she had previously used. In the book, Rule reveals that Bundy told her the number of women he murdered was much larger than police believed. In 2003, Rule was portrayed by Barbara Hershey in the movie version of the book. The made-for-TV film adaptation also starred Billy Campbell as Bundy.

Rule&#x27;s next three books, &quot;The Lust Killer&quot; about Jerry Brudos, &quot;The Want-Ad Killer&quot; about Harvey Carignan, and &quot;The I-5 Killer&quot; about Randall Woodfield, were released with her pen name but following the success of the book about Bundy, they were re-released under Rule&#x27;s name. Rule&#x27;s 1987 work, &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot;, tells the story of Diane Downs, an Oregon woman who in May 1983 murdered her daughter and attempted to murder her other two children. The book was filmed for television in 1989, with Farrah Fawcett in an Emmy-nominated and Peabody-cited performance.

In April 2012, &quot;48 Hours Mystery&quot; covered Rule&#x27;s successful effort to help a mother prove her daughter&#x27;s 1998 death was actually a murder. The resulting book was &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;. One of her last books, &quot;Practice to Deceive&quot;, about a 2003 murder on Whidbey Island, Washington, was released in October 2013. On the island for the launch of a book tour, Rule fell in the hotel and broke her hip, forcing the cancellation of the event.

== Methods and themes ==
In its obituary for Rule, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Rule on her approach to true crime writing and her favorite themes, writing, &quot;To choose a book subject, I weed through about 3,000 suggestions from readers. I&#x27;m looking for an &#x27;antihero&#x27; whose eventual arrest shocks those who knew him (or her): attractive, brilliant, charming, popular, wealthy, talented, and much admired in their communities — but really hiding behind masks.&quot; A &quot;Guardian&quot; article about Rule developed the idea further, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s tough, she says, but she doesn&#x27;t want to hear about killers who are &#x27;ugly, mean and have no charm. We’re not interested in the kind of person who looks like he would commit murder. We want to know about the kind who you could not imagine having this monstrous self behind the pleasant face.&#x27;&quot;

Rule&#x27;s style of true crime writing brought some criticism. An evaluation of her influence on the genre noted negative commentary on her approach to her most infamous subject. Despite the commercial success of her books, the critical and public reception of &quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot; was not always generous. After Rule&#x27;s death in 2015, Victoria Beale wrote a piece for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; titled &quot;Too Close to Ted Bundy&quot; in which Beale accused Rule of making poor ethical choices in reporting the story and her involvement in Bundy&#x27;s life after he went to jail, including sending money to Bundy while he was in jail. &quot;Rule&#x27;s role shifts from being inadvertently involved with a serial killer to an author considering how lucrative her access could be,&quot; Beale writes.&quot;

== Legal dispute ==
After the release of Rule&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;Heart Full of Lies&quot;, which chronicles the manslaughter conviction in the 2000 shooting death of Liysa Northon&#x27;s husband Chris, Northon filed a defamation lawsuit against Rule and her publisher. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the suit in January 2011. While Northon was serving 12 years in prison for the killing, her fiancé Rick Swart wrote a front-page article for the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; newspaper that accused Rule of &quot;sloppy storytelling&quot; in Rule&#x27;s &quot;Heart Full of Lies&quot; book. Swart did not disclose in the article that he was engaged to marry Northon, nor did his editors at the paper know of the relationship.
In response to the article, Rule in 2013 filed a libel suit against the newspaper and the writer through attorney Anne Bremner, stating that Rule had been defamed by the article&#x27;s criticism, causing damage to her reputation.

In February 2014, a judge dismissed Rule&#x27;s claims, finding that there were no false or defamatory statements about her in the article. The judge then awarded the defendants $10,000 each in damages plus attorney fees and costs. Rule appealed the judgment, and on June 22, 2015, the Washington state Court of Appeals vacated the earlier judgment against Rule and remanded the case to trial. After Rule&#x27;s death in July 2015, as of January 2017, there had been no further developments in the case.

== Personal life and death ==
Rule lived in Normandy Park, Washington and had four children, including author Leslie Rule. Rule&#x27;s family also included five grandchildren and a foster son. She was married to Bill Rule, from whom she was divorced in 1972.

In April 2015, Normandy Park Police charged Rule&#x27;s two sons with theft against their mother. Neither man was jailed. The charges against the sons were dropped on August 14, 2015, following Rule&#x27;s death. King County Senior Deputy Prosecutor Amanda Froh wrote to the court, &quot;Given the recent death of victim Ann Rule on July 26, 2015, the interests of justice are best served by dismissal of this case.&quot;

Rule&#x27;s family and publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, announced on July 26, 2015, that Rule had died a day earlier as a result of congestive heart failure. Her death followed an emergency-room visit because of a heart attack. Rule had been moved to hospice care the day before her death.

<text>Charles Bradley Templeton (October 7, 1915 – June 7, 2001) was a Canadian media figure and a former Christian evangelist. Known in the 1940s and 1950s as a leading evangelist, he became an agnostic and later embraced atheism after struggling with doubt. Afterwards, he worked at various times in journalism, radio and writing.

== Early life ==

Charles Templeton was born on October 7, 1915, in Toronto, Canada. He attended the high school Parkdale Collegiate Institute.

== Cartoonist ==

In 1932, at age 17, Charles Templeton was hired to create Chuck Templeton&#x27;s Sportraits, a daily sports cartoon, for &quot;The Toronto Globe&quot; (now &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;), leaving high school to pursue the job. His work became syndicated and earned him a comfortable living. He converted to Christianity while working as a cartoonist, and in 1936, left his job to become a preacher.

== Christian evangelist ==

After he quit his first job, Templeton became a mass evangelist. From 1936 to 1938, he toured the United States, preaching in 44 states and gaining international recognition as a leading evangelist. In 1941, Templeton started the Nazarene Avenue Road Church where he served as its preacher, renting a building that once housed a Presbyterian church. In 1955, he became the Presbyterian Church in the United States&#x27;s secretary of evangelism.

Eager to deepen his understanding about Christianity, Templeton attended Princeton Theological Seminary in the 1940s. He later received an honorary doctorate from Lafayette College.

He hosted the religious television show &quot;Look Up and Live&quot;.

Charles Templeton began to struggle with doubts about his religion eventually becoming an agnostic. This caused a wide backlash from Christian communities.

Templeton was a close friend of fellow evangelist Billy Graham, and the two shared billing as they co-founded (along with Torrey Johnson) Youth for Christ International. After Templeton became an agnostic, they remained friends but became more distant.

== Media ==

=== Journalist ===

In 1959, Templeton quit evangelism and transitioned into a media career. That same year, he was hired as executive managing editor of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, a position he held until 1964, when he entered politics. Furthermore, he founded the advertising company Technamation Canada, working there until CTV hired him as director of public affairs in 1967. In 1969, he briefly served as editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine for seven months.

=== Radio ===

Templeton became an interviewer for the radio show &quot;Close-Up&quot;. He later collaborated with Pierre Berton on the radio show &quot;Dialogue&quot; from 1966 to 1970 on CFRB, and from 1970 to 1984 on CKEY, where Templeton also served as the morning news reader.

He won two ACTRA Awards for broadcasting and in 1992, he was awarded the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal.

=== Author ===

Templeton wrote several plays that were performed on television. Templeton&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Kidnapping of the President&quot; (1974), became a bestseller and was adapted into a 1980 film. He wrote several other novels. In &quot;Farewell to God&quot; (1995 or 1996), he described his conversion to agnosticism and explained his reasons for doing so. Templeton also won the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith book award.

== Politics ==

He came second in an election for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party, although he was its vice-president in 1964 and 1965.
== Inventor ==

Templeton made his own unsuccessful designs of a child-resistant medicine cap, a cigarette filter and a pipeline. However, his design for a teddy bear that could stay warm for many hours was widely manufactured.

== Personal life ==

While he was an evangelist, Templeton married fellow evangelist and singer Constance Oroczy in 1939. In 1957, they divorced. In 1959, he married singer Sylvia Murphy, whom he met while producing a television drama; they divorced in 1976. Templeton and Murphy had four children: lawyer Michael Templeton, broadcaster Deborah Burgess, internet entrepreneur Brad Templeton, and comic book artist Ty Templeton.

In 1980, he married author Madeleine Helen Stevens Leger, and they remained married until his death.

== Death ==

On June 7, 2001, Charles Templeton died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1992–1997)===
Stone Sour was founded by Corey Taylor, who later became the vocalist of Slipknot, and former drummer Joel Ekman. The band&#x27;s name comes from a cocktail menu at a local bar. Taylor&#x27;s longtime friend Shawn Economaki joined shortly after, and filled in as the bass player. During these formative years, Stone Sour recorded two demo tapes, in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, Jim Root, who is now part of Slipknot with Taylor, joined the band. In 1996, this lineup recorded another demo tape, songs from which would be used in 2002 on their self-titled debut album. In 1997, the band went on hiatus, during which Taylor and Root spent most of their time with Slipknot, who were another up-and-coming act in Des Moines and would soon earn a record deal.

===&quot;Stone Sour&quot; and hiatus (2000–2004)===
After Josh Rand joined the band, the band recorded their debut self-titled album in Cedar Falls. Upon release, the album charted at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The song &quot;Bother&quot;, which was featured on the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; soundtrack (credited only to Taylor), peaked at number 2 on the Mainstream Rock Chart as well as number 4 on the Modern Rock Tracks and 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The next single, &quot;Inhale&quot;, peaked at 18 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The group received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Metal Performance for the singles &quot;Get Inside&quot; and &quot;Inhale&quot; in 2003 and 2004 respectively. The album went on to achieve Gold certification. The band toured for six months with label mates Sinch and Chevelle before going on a temporary hiatus as Taylor and Root went back to join Slipknot for another album and tour.

===&quot;Come What(ever) May&quot; (2005–2007)===
The band came back in 2006 to release their second studio album, &quot;Come What(ever) May&quot;. They parted ways with drummer Joel Ekman, currently drumming for Isaac James, who left to take care of his cancer-stricken son, and later recruited current drummer, Roy Mayorga (Soulfly, and later Amebix and Hellyeah). The track &quot;30/30-150&quot; was recorded with Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin. The album was released on August 1, 2006. It was met with positive reviews from critics, and sold 80,000 copies in the first week, allowing it to debut at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band toured for the next year and a half, releasing the &quot;Live in Moscow&quot; album exclusively to iTunes on August 14, 2007.

The single &quot;Sillyworld&quot; peaked at number 2 on the Mainstream Rock charts in 2006. &quot;Through Glass&quot; proved to be successful peaking at number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart, 2 on the Modern Rock Tracks, 12 on the Adult Top 40 and 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 also in 2006. They released two more singles in 2007, &quot;Made of Scars&quot; and &quot;Zzyzx Rd.&quot;, which managed to peak at numbers 21 and 29 on the Mainstream Rock charts respectively. In 2006 they received a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance nomination for the single &quot;30/30-150&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grammy Award 30/30-150&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Audio Secrecy&quot; (2009–2011)===

The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Audio Secrecy&quot;, was recorded at the Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee with producer Nick Raskulinecz, who was the producer for the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Come What(ever) May&quot;. and released on September 7, 2010. 

Stone Sour played the first annual Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar Festival with Avenged Sevenfold and Hollywood Undead among others. Stone Sour set the release date of &quot;Audio Secrecy&quot; as September 7. Stone Sour were part of the Soundwave Festival in late February/early March in Australia 2011. Stone Sour headlined The Avalanche Tour in 2011, supported by Theory of a Deadman, Skillet, Halestorm and Art of Dying. It was also announced that a Stone Sour live DVD will be released, filmed at the Brighton Centre in the United Kingdom. The band toured with Avenged Sevenfold, New Medicine and Hollywood Undead on the &quot;Nightmare After Christmas Tour&quot; 2011.

On April 16, 2011, it was announced that bassist Shawn Economaki had left the tour for personal reasons. Jason Christopher, who had played with Corey Taylor previously during his solo performances and with the Junk Beer Kidnap Band, filled in for the tour. In May 2011, Stone Sour canceled the remaining dates from their headline tour as drummer Roy Mayorga suffered a minor stroke. He made a full recovery. The band played their last show of 2011 at the second day of the Rock in Rio IV festival, which took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between September 23 – October 2. Drummer Roy Mayorga was not present at the show as he was expecting his first child back home, and filling-in for him was ex-Dream Theater and The Winery Dogs drummer Mike Portnoy.

===&quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones&quot; (2012–2013)===

The band released a song called &quot;The Pessimist&quot; as a free download on their Facebook page on March 27, 2012. The song was previously only available on the iTunes deluxe version of the . They also released their first DVD Live at Brighton in the same year, capturing their performance on November 7, 2010.

It was announced via Instagram on May 3, 2012, that bassist Shawn Economaki had parted ways with the band on amicable terms. He was replaced in the studio by current Skid Row bassist Rachel Bolan. Stone Sour started recording their fourth studio album in early 2012. Corey Taylor stated that the album would end up being a double album or concept album, and described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; meets Alice in Chains&#x27;s &quot;Dirt&quot;&quot;. It was later announced that the new material would be released as two separate albums. The first album, &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones – Part 1&quot; was released worldwide on October 23, 2012, and the second album &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones – Part 2&quot; was released worldwide on April 9, 2013. The project also has a 4-part graphic novel series that accompanies the albums, telling the linear storyline featured in the twin albums&#x27; lyrics.

The first two songs from &quot;Part 1&quot;, &quot;Gone Sovereign&quot; and the first official single, &quot;Absolute Zero&quot; were released for radio airplay in mid/late August 2012. The first single from &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones Part 2&quot; was &quot;Do Me a Favor&quot;. It was released digitally on February 12. Guitarist Josh Rand stated in an interview with O2 Academy that there was a song recorded for Part 1, an instrumental which was deemed &#x27;not up to par&#x27; by the band. The song will likely be released in the future once James Root and Josh Rand do &#x27;some stuff to it guitar-wise&#x27;.

On October 5, 2012, Johny Chow of Fireball Ministry and Cavalera Conspiracy was announced as the bassist for the band on the &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones&quot; tour cycle. Stone Sour subsequently played Soundwave Festival 2013 in Australia and on the Sunday at Download Festival 2013. Guitarist James Root did not tour with Stone Sour in the winter of 2013, as he had to take a brief hiatus from the group to work on &quot;.5: The Gray Chapter&quot; with Slipknot, although it was later revealed that he was fired from the band due to musical differences. He claimed that the band wanted to focus on &quot;radio play and money,&quot; which Root fought against, leading to his departure.

===The &quot;Burbank&quot; EP duology (2014–2016)===

On October 5, 2014, it was announced via Stone Sour&#x27;s Facebook page that the band had begun recording a covers EP, which is due to be titled &quot;Meanwhile in Burbank...&quot; and released in 2015. Corey Taylor stated about the covers EP: &quot;This is something that we&#x27;ve been talking about since the first album came out, with [Stone Sour]. We&#x27;ve always wanted to do this. Even as people have come, people have gone, this is still something we&#x27;ve always come back to, and we just never had the opportunity to do it. And we just kind of said, &#x27;Well, screw it.&#x27;&quot; On February 9, 2015, Stone Sour released an official music video and track, which is a cover version of the Metal Church&#x27;s song &quot;The Dark&quot;. The EP was released on April 18, 2015. Corey Taylor confirmed that two more covers EPs are to be produced, they will be titled &quot;Straight Outta Burbank&quot; and &quot;No Sleep Till Burbank&quot; and will feature covers of songs by Rage Against The Machine, Mötley Crüe, Bad Brains and Violent Femmes. 

&quot;Straight Outta Burbank...&quot;, the second volume in the series, has since been released.

Per Blabbermouth.net, On March 29, 2016, frontman Corey Taylor told the &quot;Someone Who Isn&#x27;t Me&quot; podcast: &quot;Originally we were going to do three [covers EPs], and now it sounds like we&#x27;re just going to do the two and just keep the other stuff we recorded as extra content for when we make the next album.&quot;

===&quot;Hydrograd&quot; (2017–2019)===
On July 26, 2016, Taylor announced the band had written and demoed 18 songs for their sixth studio album, with plans to enter the studio in January for a likely mid-2017 release. On January 23, 2017, Taylor revealed that the band was in the process of recording their upcoming album named &quot;Hydrograd&quot;. Taylor indicated that the album would incorporate heavy metal elements found in previous releases, alongside hard rock styles. Four singles have been released ahead of the album in promotion; &quot;Fabuless&quot;, &quot;Song #3&quot;, &quot;Taipei Person/Allah Tea&quot; and &quot;Mercy&quot; (A live recording from Sphere Studios), with St. Marie being released as single following the album&#x27;s release. Hydrograd released worldwide on June 30, 2017, to generally positive reviews. 

On November 6, 2019, the band announced that they would be releasing a live album titled, &quot;Hello, You Bastards: Live in Reno&quot;, on December 13 of the same year.

===Indefinite hiatus (2020–present)===
On August 10, 2020, Taylor announced on &#x27;The Green Room with Neil Griffiths&#x27; podcast that Stone Sour was taking a hiatus, saying: &quot;I feel like Stone Sour has kinda run its course for now,&quot; &quot;We all talked as a band and decided to kinda put Stone Sour in indefinite hiatus. That&#x27;s the way it is. We&#x27;ve put it on the shelf for now. Everyone&#x27;s kind of going and doing their own thing.&quot;

==Musical style==
Their style has been described as alternative metal, hard rock, post-grunge, and alternative rock. Their music features double bass drum patterns, heavy guitar riffs, dual guitar harmonies, and a combination of screaming and singing.

Guitarist Josh Rand stated in an interview that he tries to bring a metal aspect and elements of thrash metal in their music. He also stated that his writing style is different than Slipknot&#x27;s writing style.

Stone Sour&#x27;s fourth and fifth albums, &quot;House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; are notable for their concept album format, and have led to comparisons to progressive rock bands. When asked about this, Josh Rand stated: &quot;I still think it&#x27;s us. We never said that we would be Genesis or Dream Theater or Yes or any of those types of bands. We&#x27;re not a prog band. We said we&#x27;re going to adopt the ideas of those stories and stuff, but it&#x27;s still going to be a Stone Sour record, where you can still pull those individual songs. We just wanted to offer something more - in a world where it&#x27;s all about singles, we just wanted to do something different. We&#x27;ve always evolved from record to record, if you listen to our entire catalog.&quot;

<doc id="935151" wikidata="Q1414611" url="?curid=935151" title="Crisis hotline">
<text>A crisis hotline is a phone number people can call to get immediate emergency telephone counseling, usually by trained volunteers. The first such service was founded in England in 1951 and such hotlines have existed in most major cities of the English speaking world at least since the mid-1970s. Initially set up to help those contemplating suicide, many have expanded their mandate to deal more generally with emotional crises. Similar hotlines operate to help people in other circumstances, including rape, bullying, self-harm, runaway children, human trafficking, and people who identify as LGBTQ+ or intersex. Despite crisis hotlines being common, their effectiveness in reducing suicides is not clear.

==Effectiveness==
Even though crisis hotlines are common, they have not been well studied for efficacy. One study found that people&#x27;s thoughts of suicide decreased during a call to a crisis line, and were lessened for several weeks after their call. Some callers frequently call crisis helplines, which can take up time from those with more immediate crises.

==History==
Such services began in 1953, when Chad Varah, an English vicar, founded The Samaritans service, which soon established branches throughout the United Kingdom. The first Samaritans branch in the United States was established in Boston in 1974. 

Crisis and Suicide Hotline started in Seattle, WA in 1964 run by Crisis Connections, formerly Crisis Clinic after the assault of a 12-year old girl by a letter carrier. 
In addition to Boston, there are currently Samaritan branches in Falmouth, Massachusetts (serving the Cape Cod and Islands area), the Merrimack Valley, and the Fall River/New Bedford area. Outside of Massachusetts, there are branches in New York City, Providence, Hartford, Albany, and Keene, New Hampshire.

In the United States, the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center was founded in 1958 and was the first in the country to provide a 24-hour suicide prevention crisis line and use community volunteers in providing hotline service. Bernard Mayes started the San Francisco Suicide Prevention with a hotline named &quot;Call Bruce&quot; in 1962. A similar service, Lifeline, was established in Australia in 1963.

Another service, the volunteer-run crisis helpline Lifelink Samaritans Tas. Inc, originally called Launceston Lifelink, was established in 1968 by concerned citizens of Launceston, Tasmania, who decided to create a phone service based on the principles of The Samaritans. The rationale was that people often become suicidal because they cannot discuss their emotional pain with family and friends.

This service provides emotional support 24 hours a day to people throughout Tasmania and does not have any religious affiliations. The organization is a member of Befrienders Worldwide and has a &quot;twinning&quot; relationship with Northampton Samaritans in the UK. Lifelink Samaritans is the oldest telephone befriending service in Tasmania and the fourth oldest in Australia and receives at least 5,000 calls a year. In December 2018 Lifelink Samaritans celebrated 50 years of service.

== Telephone counseling ==
Telephone emotional support and crisis hotlines provide a similar telephone support service, and both usually accept crisis and non-crisis calls. In the United States, many college campuses have established telephone counseling lines serviced by volunteers. These hotlines serve callers in crisis, but also serve to provide a listening ear for people who &quot;just need to talk&quot;. Typically, hotlines are staffed by trained professionals, and are not intended to replace professional, long-term counseling services. They are rather intended to carry callers through an immediate situation. Such hotlines exist at the University of Maryland, the University of Minnesota, Tufts University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Drexel University, Caldwell University, and Texas A&amp;M University.

The term &quot;emotional support helpline&quot; is sometimes used – which does not imply crisis or counseling, and can include email and text messaging. Such services have allowed for the wider dissemination of resources for people facing mental health crises.

With developments in mobile telephony, the use of text or SMS (short message service) has been utilized by counseling services. Youthline, a youth-oriented crisis helpline in New Zealand, began providing a text messaging counseling support line in 2004.

<doc id="935155" wikidata="Q1975027" url="?curid=935155" title="Perfectionism (philosophy)">
<text>In ethics and value theory, perfectionism is the persistence of will in obtaining the optimal quality of spiritual, mental, physical, and material being. Thomas Hurka describes perfectionism as follows:
This moral theory starts from an account of the good life, or the intrinsically desirable life. And it characterizes this life in a distinctive way. Certain properties, it says, constitute human nature or are definitive of humanity—they make humans human. The good life, it then says, develops these properties to a high degree or realizes what is central to human nature. Different versions of the theory may disagree about what the relevant properties are and so disagree about the content of the good life. But they share the foundational idea that what is good, ultimately, is the development of human nature.

==History==
Perfectionism, as a moral theory, has a long history and has been addressed by influential philosophers. Aristotle stated his conception of the good life (eudaimonia). He taught that politics and political structures should promote the good life among individuals; because the &quot;polis&quot; can best promote the good life, it should be adopted over other forms of social organization.

The philosopher Stanley Cavell develops the concept of moral perfectionism as the idea that there is an unattained but attainable self that one ought to strive to reach. Moral perfectionists believe that the ancient questions such as &quot;Am I living as I am supposed to?&quot; make all the difference in the world and they describe the commitment we ought to have in ways that seem, but are not, impossibly demanding. We do so because it is only in the keeping such an &quot;impossible&quot; view in mind that one can strive for one&#x27;s &quot;unattained but attainable self.&quot;

In his book &quot;Cities of Words: Pedagogical Letters on a Register of the Moral Life&quot; (2005), based on a lecture course called &quot;Moral Perfectionism&quot; that he first gave at Harvard University in the 1980s, Stanley Cavell characterizes moral perfectionism in general, and what he calls &quot;Emersonian perfectionism,&quot; the form of moral perfectionism he embraces and defends, not as a theory of moral philosophy comparable to Immanuel Kant’s deontological view that there is a universal moral law (the categorical imperative) by which we can rationally determine whether an action is right or wrong, or John Stuart Mill’s utilitarian view that the good action is that which will cause the least harm, or the greatest good for the greatest number. For Cavell, moral perfectionism is an outlook or register of thought, a way of thinking about morality expressed thematically in certain works of philosophy, literature and film. As William Rothman summarizes the idea, Cavell &quot;takes it to be our primary task as human beings—at once our deepest wish, whether or not we know this about ourselves, and our moral obligation—to become more fully human, to realize our humanity in our lives in the world, which always requires the simultaneous acknowledgment of the humanity of others (our acknowledgment of them, and theirs of us).&quot; &quot;Cities of Words&quot; pairs chapters on major philosophers in the Western tradition, such as Plato, Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, John Stuart Mill, Sigmund Freud and John Rawls, endorsing Cavell&#x27;s understanding of moral perfectionism and such artists as William Shakespeare, Henry James, Henrik Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw, with chapters on a film, all but one (&quot;A Tale of Winter&quot; (1992) by Eric Rohmer) a member of the classical Hollywood genres; what he called &quot;the comedy of remarriage&quot; and &quot;the melodrama of the unknown woman&quot;. Cavell&#x27;s argument is that these films are illustrative of moral perfectionism (and, more specifically, Emersonian perfectionism).The moral questions couples in remarriage comedies like &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; address in their witty give- and-take, for example, are, as Cavell puts it, &quot;formulated less well by questions concerning what they ought to do, what it would be best or right for them to do, than by the question how they shall live their lives, what kind of persons they aspire to be.&quot;7

==Happiness==
Perfection means more than—or something different from—happiness or pleasure, and perfectionism is distinct from utilitarianism in all its forms. A society devoted to perfectionist principles may not produce happy citizens—far from it. Kant regarded such a society as government paternalism, which he denied for the sake of a &quot;patriotic&quot; state (&quot;imperium non paternale, sed patrioticum&quot;). While the individual is responsible for living a virtuous life, the state should be limited to the regulation of human coexistence.

Alfred Naquet was of the view that there are no universal parameters of perfection. Individuals and cultures choose those values that, for them, represent the ideal of perfection. For example, one individual may view education as leading perfection, while to another beauty is the highest ideal. 

He wrote in this regard:

The true role of collective existence ... is to learn, to discover, to know. Eating, drinking, sleeping, living, in a word, is a mere accessory. In this respect, we are not distinguished from the brute. Knowledge is the goal. If I were condemned to choose between a humanity materially happy, glutted after the manner of a flock of sheep in a field, and a humanity existing in misery, but from which emanated, here and there, some eternal truth, it is on the latter my choice would fall.
From a critical perspective, similar sentiments were expressed by Matthew Arnold in his Culture and Anarchy essays. According to the view he advanced in the 1869 publication, &quot;Culture [...] is a study of perfection&quot;. He further wrote that: &quot;[Culture] seeks to do away with classes; to make the best that has been thought and known in the world current everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetness and light [...]&quot;.

Moreover, in the preface of that text, he wrote: 

The whole scope of the essay is to recommend culture as the great help out of our present difficulties; culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world, and, through this knowledge, turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stock notions and habits, which we now follow staunchly but mechanically, vainly imagining that there is a virtue in following them staunchly which makes up for the mischief of following them mechanically.
==Transhumanism==
Philosopher Mark Alan Walker argues that rational perfectionism is, or should be, the ethical imperative behind transhumanism.

<doc id="935160" wikidata="Q1121749" url="?curid=935160" title="Perfectionism (psychology)">
<text>Perfectionism, in psychology, is a broad personality trait characterized by a person&#x27;s concern with striving for flawlessness and perfection and is accompanied by critical self-evaluations and concerns regarding others&#x27; evaluations. It is best conceptualized as a multidimensional and multilayered personality characteristic, and initially some psychologists thought that there were many positive and negative aspects.

Maladaptive perfectionism drives people to be concerned with achieving unattainable ideals or unrealistic goals that often lead to many forms of adjustment problems such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD, OCPD and low self-esteem. These adjustment problems often lead to suicidal thoughts and tendencies and influence or invite other psychological, physical, social, and further achievement problems in children, adolescents, and adults.

Although perfectionist sights can reduce stress, anxiety, and panic, recent data, compiled by British psychologists Thomas Curran and Andrew Hill, show that perfectionist tendencies are on the rise among recent generations of young people.

== Definition ==
Perfectionists strain compulsively and unceasingly toward unattainable goals. They measure their self-worth by productivity and accomplishments to the point that some tendencies even lead to distraction from other areas of life. Perfectionists pressure themselves to achieve unrealistic goals that inevitably lead to disappointment. Perfectionists tend to be harsh critics of themselves, their work, and their failure to meet their own expectations.

===Normal vs. neurotic===
In 1978, D. E. Hamachek argued for two contrasting types of perfectionism, classifying people as tending towards normal perfectionism or neurotic perfectionism. Normal perfectionists are more inclined to pursue perfection without compromising their self-esteem, and derive pleasure from their efforts. Neurotic perfectionists are prone to strive for unrealistic goals and feel dissatisfied when they cannot reach them. Hamachek offers several strategies that have been proven useful in helping people change from maladaptive towards healthier behavior. Contemporary research supports the idea that these two basic aspects of perfectionist behavior, as well as other dimensions such as &quot;nonperfectionism&quot;, can be differentiated. They have been labeled differently, and are sometimes referred to as positive striving and maladaptive evaluation concerns, active and passive perfectionism, positive and negative perfectionism, and adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism. Although there is a general perfectionism that affects all realms of life, some researchers contend that levels of perfectionism are significantly different across different domains (i.e. work, academic, sport, interpersonal relationships, home life).

However, it is debated whether perfectionism can be adaptive and has positive aspects. In fact, recent research suggests that what is termed &quot;adaptive perfectionism&quot; is associated with suicidal thinking, depression, eating disorders, poor health and early mortality. Some researchers argue that, certainly, a construct that causes people to think more about suicide, and places them at risk for depression, eating disorders, poor health, and early mortality is far from one that is adaptive. In fact, there is no empirical support for the assertion that a healthy form of perfectionism exists. Instead, what has been termed adaptive perfectionism has little relation to perfectionism and has more to do with striving for excellence. A relentless striving for unreasonably high expectations that are rarely achieved and an avoidance of imperfection at all costs is what distinguishes perfectionism from excellencism. Perfectionism therefore extends beyond adaptive strivings and is not a synonym for excellence or conscientiousness. Numerous researchers advise against using the term &quot;adaptive perfectionism&quot; as it is inappropriate for a personality trait.

There is some literature that supports the usage of adaptive perfectionism when used in comparison with maladaptive perfectionism. Differences were found when these two dimensions of perfectionism were paired with the Big Five personality traits. For example, adaptive perfectionism was found to predict openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, while maladaptive perfectionism was found to predict neuroticism.

===Strivings vs. concerns===
J. Stoeber and K. Otto suggested in a narrative review that perfectionism consists of two main dimensions: perfectionist strivings and perfectionist concerns. perfectionist strivings are associated with positive aspects of perfectionism; perfectionist concerns are associated with negative aspects (see below).
* Healthy perfectionists score high in perfectionist strivings and low in perfectionist concerns.
* Unhealthy perfectionists score high in both strivings and concerns.
* Non-perfectionists show low levels of perfectionist strivings.
Prompted by earlier research providing empirical evidence that perfectionism could be associated with positive aspects (specifically perfectionist strivings), they challenged the widespread belief that perfectionism is only detrimental through a non-empirical narrative review. They claimed that people with high levels of perfectionist strivings and low levels of perfectionist concerns demonstrated more self-esteem, agreeableness, academic success and social interaction. This type of perfectionist also showed fewer psychological and somatic issues typically associated with perfectionism, namely depression, anxiety and maladaptive coping styles. However, empirical meta-analytic reviews have failed to replicate these claims.

=== The Comprehensive Model of Perfectionist Behaviour ===
The Comprehensive Model of Perfectionism (CMPB) operationalizes perfectionism as a multilevel and multidimensional personality style that contains a trait level, a self-presentational level, and a cognitive level.

The stable, dispositional, trait-like level of this model includes self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as other-oriented perfectionism. Self-oriented perfectionism is characterized by requiring perfection from oneself, while socially prescribed perfectionism refers to the need to obtain acceptance by fulfilling actual or perceived expectations imposed by others. In contrast, other-oriented perfectionists direct their perfectionism towards external sources and are preoccupied with expecting perfection from others.

The second component of the Comprehensive Model of Perfectionism contains the interpersonal expression of perfection through impression management and self-monitoring. This relational component reflects the need to appear, rather than be, perfect via the promotion of perfection and the concealment of imperfection. Like the perfectionism traits, these components are also multifaceted. One of its facets, perfectionist self-promotion, refers to the expression of perfectionism by actively presenting a flawless, though often false, image of oneself. Another interpersonal facet, nondisplay of imperfection, is the expression of perfectionism through concealment of attributes or behaviours that may be deemed as imperfect, such as making mistakes in front of others. Similarly, nondisclosure of imperfection is also associated with concealment of self-aspects, but focuses on avoiding verbal disclosure of imperfections, such as not revealing personal information that may be judged negatively or admitting failures. All three facets are used as an (alleged) protection from feelings of low self-worth and possible rejection.

The self-relational/intrapersonal component of the CMPB refers to ruminative, perfectionist thinking and is characterized by cognitive processes concerning the need for perfection, as well as self-recriminations and a focus on the discrepancy between one&#x27;s actual and ideal self. This component therefore entails the information processing related to perfectionism. These three components of the Comprehensive Model of Perfectionism are independent but interrelated, and can be present in individuals in heterogeneous, idiosyncratic patterns with different combinations.

=== The Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model ===
The Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model (PSDM) is a dynamic-relational model describing perfectionism and its consequences in an interpersonal context. This model asserts that perfectionism, via an interpersonal style characterized by aloofness and inauthenticity, leads to the social disconnection and rejection perfectionists aim to avoid. According to the PSDM, perfectionism develops in an early interpersonal context through asynchrony between child and caregiver, when there is a lack of attunement (&quot;fit&quot;) between the temperament of the child and caregiver responses, leading to unfulfilled needs for belonging, acceptance, and self-esteem. This creates a relational schema of others as critical, and rejecting, and an internal model of oneself as defective which makes perfectionists highly sensitive to the potential for judgment and rejection in interpersonal encounters. Consequently, according to the PSDM, perfectionism serves an interpersonal purpose and the person relies on it as a means of fulfilling the needs for belonging and self-esteem. In an attempt to gain a sense of acceptance and connection while avoiding possible judgment and rejection, these individuals aim to be or appear flawless. Paradoxically, this often rigid, aloof, and self-concealing relational style increases the potential for alienation and rejection and can lead to social disconnection. In this way, the very behaviours that perfectionists consider as purportedly fulfilling unmet relational needs exert a detrimental influence on interpersonal encounters, so the alleged solution to social disconnection actually generates it. The PSDM also provides a link between perfectionism and its maladaptive consequences since the estrangement from oneself and others generated by perfectionism is associated with a number of adverse outcomes, such as interpersonal difficulties, depression, and suicide risk.

==Measurement==

===Multidimensional perfectionism scale (MPS)===
Randy O. Frost et al. (1990) developed a multidimensional perfectionism scale (now known as the &quot;Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale&quot;, FMPS) with six dimensions:
#Concern over making mistakes
#High personal standards (striving for excellence)
#The perception of high parental expectations
#The perception of high parental criticism
#The doubting of the quality of one&#x27;s actions, and
#A preference for order and organization.

Hewitt &amp; Flett (1991) devised another &quot;multidimensional perfectionism scale&quot;, a 45-item measure that rates three aspects of perfectionist self-presentation:
# Self-oriented perfectionism
# Other-oriented perfectionism, and
# Socially prescribed perfectionism.

Self-oriented perfectionism refers to having unrealistic expectations and standards for oneself that lead to perfectionist motivation. Other-oriented perfectionism is having unrealistic expectations and standards for others that in turn pressure them to have perfectionist motivations of their own. Socially prescribed perfectionism is characterized by developing perfectionist motivations due actual or perceived high expectations of significant others. Parents who push their children to be successful in certain endeavors (such as athletics or academics) provide an example of what often causes this type of perfectionism, as the children feel that they must meet their parents&#x27; lofty expectations.

A similarity has been pointed out among Frost&#x27;s distinction between &quot;setting high standards for oneself&quot; and the level of &quot;concern over making mistakes in performance&quot; (the two most important dimensions of the FMPS) and Hewitt &amp; Flett&#x27;s distinction between &quot;self-oriented&quot; versus &quot;socially prescribed perfectionism&quot;.

===Perfectionist Self-Presentation Scale (PSPS)===
Hewitt et al. (2003) developed the perfectionist Self-Presentation Scale (PSPS), a 27-item self-report measure assessing the three interpersonal, expressive components of the Comprehensive Model of Perfectionism. It includes three subscales pertaining to perfectionist self-presentation, i.e., to the need to appear flawless:

#perfectionist self-promotion
#Non-display of imperfection
#Nondisclosure of imperfection

The PSPS measures the expression (the process) of the trait of perfectionism and is directly linked to the perfectionism traits, particularly self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism. Additionally, the dimensions of the PSPS correlate with measures of psychological distress, such as anxiety symptoms, indicating that perfectionist self-presentation is a maladaptive, defensive tendency.

===Perfectionism Cognitions Inventory (PCI)===
The Perfectionism Cognitions Inventory (PCI) developed by Flett, Hewitt, Blankstein, and Gray (1998) is a 25-item inventory measuring the self-relational, cognitive component of perfectionism in the form of automatic thoughts about attaining perfection. It includes statements about perfectionism-themed cognitions, such as references to social comparison and awareness of being imperfect and failing to attain high expectations. Rather than emphasizing trait-like statements, the PCI is characterized by state-like statements, focusing on the varying situational and temporal contexts that can lead to different perfectionist thoughts.

The PCI is associated with the presence of negative automatic thoughts and scoring high on this measure has been linked to a high degree of self-criticism, self-blame and failure perseveration.

=== Almost perfect scale-revised (APS-R) ===
Slaney and his colleagues (1996) developed the &quot;Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R)&quot;. People are classified based on their scores for three measures:
#High Standards
#Order, and
#Discrepancy

Discrepancy refers to the belief that personal high standards are not being met, which is the defining negative aspect of perfectionism. Those with high scores in what the APS-R considers maladaptive perfectionism typically yield the highest social stress and anxiety scores, reflecting their feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. However, whether high standards as measured by APS-R actually assess perfectionism is debatable.

In general, the APS-R is a relatively easy instrument to administer, and can be used to identify perfectionist adolescents as well as adults, though it has yet to be proven useful for children. Two other forms of the APS-R measure perfectionism directed towards intimate partners (Dyadic Almost Perfect Scale) and perceived perfectionism from one&#x27;s family (Family Almost Perfect Scale).

The validity of the APS-R has been challenged. Namely, some researchers maintain that high standards are not necessarily perfectionist standards. For instance, it has been shown that when the APS-R is re-worded to reflect more perfectionist terms, outcomes differ in comparison to the original wording of this scale. Specifically, only the reworded, more perfectionist scale is associated with maladjustment, such as depression and anxiety, while only the original scale is related to adaptive outcomes. This suggests that what is labelled as &quot;adaptive perfectionism&quot; in the original APS-R may simply reflect high standards. Moreover, a number of researchers view the relevance of discrepancy to the perfectionism literature as suspect given the number of negative mood terms included. Including negative mood terms in items, such as the discrepancy subscale, greatly increases the likelihood for discovering a relation between perfectionism and neuroticism which may be simply due to wording rather than a perfectionism-neuroticism link.

===Physical appearance perfectionism scale (PAPS)===
The &quot;Physical Appearance Perfectionism Scale (PAPS)&quot; explains a particular type of perfectionism: the desire for a perfect physical appearance. The PAPS is a multidimensional assessment of physical appearance perfectionism that provides the most insight when the sub-scales are evaluated separately.

In general, the PAPS allows researchers to determine participants&#x27; body image and self-conceptions of their looks, which is critical in present times when so much attention is paid to attractiveness and obtaining the ideal appearance. The two sub-scales it uses to assess appearance concerns are:
# Worry About Imperfection, and
# Hope For Perfection.

Those that obtain high &quot;Worry About Imperfection&quot; scores are usually greatly concerned with attaining perfection, physical appearance, and body control behavior. They also demonstrate low positive self-perceptions of their appearance, whereas those scoring highly on &quot;Hope for Perfection&quot; yielded high positive self-perceptions. Hope For Perfection also corresponded with impression management behaviors and striving for ambitious goals.

In summary, Worry About Imperfection relates to negative aspects of appearance perfectionism, while Hope For Perfection relates to positive aspects. One limitation of using the PAPS is the lack of psychological literature evaluating its validity.

==Psychological implications==
Perfectionists tend to dissociate themselves from their flaws or what they believe are flaws (such as negative emotions) and can become hypocritical and hypercritical of others, seeking the illusion of virtue to hide their own vices.

Researchers have begun to investigate the role of perfectionism in various mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, autism and personality disorders, as well as suicide. Each disorder is associated with varying levels of the three subscales on the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. For instance, socially prescribed perfectionism in young women has been associated with greater body-image dissatisfaction and avoidance of social situations that focus on weight and physical appearance.

The relationship that exists between perfectionist tendencies and methods of coping with stress has also been examined in some detail. Those who displayed tendencies associated with perfectionism, such as rumination over past events or fixation on mistakes, tended to utilize more passive or avoidance coping. They also tended to utilize self-criticism as a coping method. This is consistent with theories that conceptualize self-criticism as a central element of perfectionism.

== Consequences ==
Perfectionism can be damaging. It can take the form of procrastination when used to postpone tasks and self-deprecation when used to excuse poor performance or to seek sympathy and affirmation from other people. These, together or separate, are self-handicapping strategies perfectionists may use to protect their sense of self-competence. In general, perfectionists feel constant pressure to meet their high expectations, which creates cognitive dissonance when expectations cannot be met. Perfectionism has been associated with numerous other psychological and physiological complications. Moreover, perfectionism may result in alienation and social disconnection via certain rigid interpersonal patterns common to perfectionist individuals.

===Suicide===
Perfectionism is increasingly considered to be a risk factor for suicide. The tendency of perfectionists to have excessively high expectations of self and to be self-critical when their efforts do not meet the expectations they have established, combined with their tendency to present a public image of flawlessness increases their risk of suicidal ideation while decreasing the likelihood of seeking help when it is needed. Perfectionism is one of many suicide predictors that affect individuals negatively via pressure to fulfill other- or self-generated high expectations, feeling incapable of living up to them, and social disconnection.

Importantly, the relation between suicidality and perfectionism depends on the particular perfectionism dimensions. perfectionist strivings are associated with suicidal ideation while perfectionist concerns are predictive of both suicidal ideation and attempting suicide. Additionally, socially prescribed perfectionism, a type of perfectionist concern, was found to be associated with both baseline and long-term suicidal ideation. This implies that perfectionist concerns, such as socially prescribed perfectionism, are related to more pernicious outcomes in the context of suicide.

=== Anorexia nervosa ===
Perfectionism has been linked with anorexia nervosa in research for decades. Researchers in 1949 described the behavior of the average anorexic person as being &quot;rigid&quot; and &quot;hyperconscious&quot;, observing also a tendency to &quot;neatness, meticulosity, and a mulish stubbornness not amenable to reason [which] make her a rank perfectionist&quot;. Perfectionism is an enduring characteristic in the biographies of anorexics. It is present before the onset of the eating disorder, generally in childhood, during the illness, and also, after remission. The incessant striving for thinness among anorexics is itself a manifestation of this personality style, of an insistence upon meeting unattainably high standards of performance.

Because of its chronicity, those with eating disorders also display perfectionist tendencies in other domains of life than dieting and weight control. Over-achievement at school, for example, has been observed among anorexics, as a result of their overly industrious behavior.

The level of perfectionism was found to have an influence on individual&#x27;s long-term recovery of anorexia. Those who scored a lower range of perfectionism were able to have a faster recovery rate than patients who scored high in perfectionism.

===General applications===
Perfectionism often shows up in performance at work or school, neatness and aesthetics, organization, writing, speaking, physical appearance, and health and personal cleanliness. In the workplace, perfectionism is often marked by low productivity and missed deadlines as people lose time and energy by paying attention to irrelevant details of their tasks, ranging from major projects to mundane daily activities. This can lead to depression, social alienation, and a greater risk of workplace &quot;accidents&quot;. Adderholdt-Elliot (1989) describes five characteristics of perfectionist students and teachers which contribute to underachievement: procrastination, fear of failure, an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; mindset, paralyzed perfectionism, and workaholism.

According to C. Allen, in intimate relationships, unrealistic expectations can cause significant dissatisfaction for both partners. Greenspon lists behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that typically characterize perfectionism. Perfectionists will not be content with their work until it meets their standards, which can make perfectionists less efficient in finishing projects, and they therefore will struggle to meet deadlines.

In a different occupational context, athletes may develop perfectionist tendencies. Optimal physical and mental performance is critical for professional athletes, which are aspects that closely relate to perfectionism. Although perfectionist athletes strive to succeed, they can be limited by their intense fear of failure and therefore not exert themselves fully or feel overly personally responsible for a loss. Because their success is frequently measured by a score or statistics, perfectionist athletes may feel excessive pressure to succeed.

===Medical complications===
Perfectionism is a risk factor for obsessive–compulsive disorder, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, eating disorders, social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, workaholism, self harm and suicide, substance abuse, and clinical depression as well as physical problems like heart disease. In addition, studies have found that people with perfectionism have a higher mortality rate than those without perfectionism. A possible reason for this is the additional stress and worry that accompanies the irrational belief that everything should be perfect.

Therapists attempt to tackle the negative thinking that surrounds perfectionism, in particular the &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; thinking in which the client believes that an achievement is either perfect or useless. They encourage clients to set realistic goals and to face their fear of failure.

Since perfectionism is a self-esteem issue based on emotional convictions about what one must do to be acceptable as a person, negative thinking is most successfully addressed in the context of a recovery process which directly addresses these convictions.

=== Impact on psychological treatment ===
A number of studies suggest that perfectionism can limit the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Namely, perfectionism impedes treatment success across seeking, maintaining, and ultimately benefiting from help. Unfavourable attitudes and negative beliefs towards seeking help present a barrier to treatment among perfectionists. When they do attend treatment, perfectionists, especially those high in perfectionist self-presentation, are more likely to experience initial clinical interviews as anxiety-provoking and appraise their performance as inadequate. Perfectionism can also affect treatment adherence. For example, a study demonstrated that other-oriented perfectionism is associated with treatment attrition. Further, treatment effectiveness may be compromised by perfectionists&#x27; tendency to present an image of flawlessness and avoid self-disclosures because of an excessive sensitivity to judgment and rejection. Most importantly, treatment success may be negatively impacted due to the interpersonal disconnection prevalent among perfectionists which is associated with a failure to develop or strengthen a positive therapeutic alliance.

== Narcissism ==
According to Arnold Cooper, narcissism can be considered as a self-perceived form of perfectionism – &quot;an insistence on perfection in the idealized self-object and the limitless power of the grandiose self. These are rooted in traumatic injuries to the grandiose self.&quot; In support, research suggests some forms of perfectionism are associated with grandiose narcissism while others are associated with vulnerable narcissism. Similar to perfectionism, narcissism, particularly in its vulnerable form, is associated with a contingent self-worth and a need for validation. Narcissists often are pseudo-perfectionists and require being the center of attention and create situations where they will receive attention. This attempt at being perfect is cohesive with the narcissist&#x27;s grandiose self-image. Behind such perfectionism, self psychology would see earlier traumatic injuries to the grandiose self.

Vulnerable narcissism is mostly covert and is characterized by a need for other people&#x27;s recognition (e.g., validation or admiration) and a sense of self-worth that is contingent upon this recognition. If a perceived state of perfection is not attained and recognition is not forthcoming or doubtful, this can result in a lowered self-worth, social withdrawal and avoidance behaviours as the individual fear that he or she will lose validation and admiration.

==Personality traits==
Perfectionism is one of Raymond Cattell&#x27;s 16 Personality Factors. According to this construct, people who are organized, compulsive, self-disciplined, socially precise, exacting will power, controlled, and self-sentimental are perfectionists. In the Big Five personality traits, perfectionism is an extreme manifestation of conscientiousness and can provoke increasing neuroticism as the perfectionist&#x27;s expectations are not met.

Perfectionist concerns are more similar to neuroticism while perfectionist strivings are more similar to conscientiousness.

==Children and adolescents==
The prevalence of perfectionism is high in children and adolescents, with estimates ranging from 25% to 30%. Similar to adults, perfectionism in young people is a core vulnerability factor for a variety of negative outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In order to measure the two trait components of self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism in this age group, the widely used Child-Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS) can be useful.

==Treatments==

=== Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) ===
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to successfully help perfectionists in reducing social anxiety, public self-consciousness, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) behaviors, and perfectionism. By using this approach, a person can begin to recognize their irrational thinking and find an alternative way to approach situations.

=== Psychodynamic/interpersonal therapy (PI) ===
Consistent with the development and expression of perfectionism within an interpersonal context, this treatment focuses on the dynamic-relational basis of perfectionism. Rather than targeting perfectionist behaviour directly and aiming merely for symptom reduction, dynamic-relational therapy is characterized by a focus on the maladaptive relational patterns and interpersonal dynamics underlying and maintaining perfectionism. According to research by Hewitt et al. (2015), this form of treatment is associated with long-lasting reductions in both perfectionism and associated distress.

=== Exposure and response prevention (ERP) ===
Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is also employed by psychologists in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, including perfectionism. This form of therapy is premised on encouraging individuals to stop their perfectionist behavior in tasks that they would normally pursue toward perfection. Over time, anxiety may decrease as the person finds that there are no major consequences of completing particular tasks imperfectly.

=== Acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) ===
Acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) was demonstrated to have a major contribution to treat perfectionism from increasing awareness, increasing acceptance, and living a meaningful life. These practices were shown to help reduce anxiety, depression, and social phobia. This approach has been shown to be effective six months post to the therapy.

<doc id="935171" wikidata="Q1056267" url="?curid=935171" title="Runaway (dependent)">
<text>A runaway is a minor or (depending upon the local jurisdiction) a person under a specified age who has left their parents or legal guardians without permission.

==Causes==
Current studies suggest that the primary cause of youth homelessness is family dysfunction in the form of parental neglect, physical or sexual abuse, family substance use disorder, and family violence. Nearly half of runaway youths report that at least one of their parents struggles with alcohol addiction, and at least one third reported a parent struggling with drug addiction.

Studies also show that 89% of child runaways were encouraged to do so by their peers.

==Consequences of running away==
Runaways have an elevated risk of destructive behavior. Approximately fifty percent of runaways experience difficulties with schooling, including dropping out, expulsion, or suspension. Running away can increase the risk of delinquency for adolescents, and expose them to the risk of victimization. There have been many studies in multiple countries about &quot;street children&quot;—youth who have run away and are presently homeless—showing that they have a high risk of taking illicit drugs, developing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), unintended pregnancy, depression, suicide attempts, and sexual exploitation. Greater proportions of runaway youths experience clinically significant post-traumatic stress disorder than normative youths. Trauma generally begins with runaway youth&#x27;s experiences within the family and is increased by prolonged traumatic events. The likelihood of depression among female runaways is typically related to family conflict and communication. Depression in male runaways is typically related to paternal alcohol use disorder and poor family relationships. Negative interactions in relationships within the family appear to greatly influence depressive symptoms for both of these genders.

==Runaways in international contexts==

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong, 51.1 percent of at-risk youth identified by social workers have been a runaway during the age range of 11 to 18.

===India===
Approximately 47 million runaway and homeless adolescents are estimated to be on the streets of India. Studies have shown a higher prevalence of adolescent boys running away than adolescent girls.

Familial respect is important in India. Much of the Indian runaway population describes themselves as young people doing everything right at home, but having received harsh treatment from family members all throughout life. Mistreatment consists of anything from favoring one child over another to extreme abuse.

===Mainland China===
Social control theory describes the runaway situation in China. Adolescent friendships can interfere with positive influences parents place in the adolescent&#x27;s life. According to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, approximately 150,000 runaway children and youth were documented in 2006. Unrealistic expectations of school has caused many adolescents to run away. Many runaways are low achievers who reported they were constantly criticized by their teachers and experienced their teachers indifferent attitude toward them. Overbearing parents&#x27; authoritarian, overprotective, and neglectful styles have led to adolescents running away.

===United States===

In the United States, a runaway is a minor who leaves home without permission and stays away either overnight (14 years old and younger or older and mentally incompetent) or away from home two nights (15 or over) and chooses not to come home when expected to return. A runaway is different from child abandonment or a &quot;throwaway&quot; youth (a youth who isn&#x27;t formally abandoned by parents, but is frequently ignored in favor of another sibling). Runaway youth are evenly divided male and female, although girls are more likely to seek help through shelters and hotlines. In the United States, runaway children or youth are widely regarded as a chronic and serious social problem. It is estimated that each year, there are between 1.3 and 1.5 million runaway and homeless youth in the United States According to a 1983 training report on the United States Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs website, a large percentage of runaways in the US leave their home to escape sexual assault.

Running away from home is considered a crime in some jurisdictions, but it is usually a status offense punished with probation, or not punished at all. Giving aid or assistance to a runaway instead of turning them in to the police is a more serious crime called &quot;harboring a runaway&quot;, and is typically a misdemeanor. The law can vary considerably from one jurisdiction to another; in the United States, there is a different law in every state. A 2003 FBI study showed that there were 123,581 arrests for runaway youths in the United States.

The Family and Youth Services Bureau of the United States Department of Health and Human Services funds grant programs to help runaway and homeless youth. The organization also provides funding for the National Runaway Switchboard, a national hotline for runaway youth, youth who are thinking about running away or are in crisis, parents, and other concerned adults.

== Notable runaways ==

* Isa Hasan al-Yasiri – (1942), Iraqi-Canadian poet. When he was ten years old, he ran away from school without the knowledge of his family to the village of his maternal uncles. He traveled there with a caravan of camels, walking with them all night long. He stated years later at the age of 74 that he had defined his childhood self-concept based on freedom.

<doc id="935174" wikidata="Q3815090" url="?curid=935174" title="Kid Eternity">
<text>Kid Eternity is a fictional character, a comic book superhero that premiered in &quot;Hit Comics&quot; #25 written by Otto Binder, drawn by Sheldon Moldoff, and published by American company Quality Comics in December 1942. DC Comics acquired Kid Eternity, among other characters, after Quality Comics shut down. In the 1980s, Kid Eternity was folded into the &quot;Shazam&quot; series and revealed to be Christopher Freeman, the brother of Freddy Freeman / Captain Marvel Jr.

Kid Eternity was rebooted in 1991 by Grant Morrison with a new focus and backstory; the character has appeared sporadically since then.

==Quality Comics==

Prior to issue #25, &quot;Hit Comics&quot; had a series of rotating cover features, including Hercules, the Red Bee, Stormy Foster and Neon the Unknown. However, December 1942 saw the entire line-up of comics at Quality change their features (if not always the cover feature). Kid Eternity was brought in from the start as the new cover feature for &quot;Hit&quot;.

The character may have been based on the 1941 film &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, in which a prizefighter dies too soon in a plane crash and is given a new life by a celestial guide.

Kid Eternity received a self-titled solo series in spring 1946. His antagonists, Her Highness and Silk were given their own strip in &quot;Hit Comics&quot; #29 through #57.

By the late 1940s, however, Quality Comics was experiencing the post-war bust that most superhero comics were. In November 1949, Kid Eternity&#x27;s self-titled magazine was discontinued and his lead slot in &quot;Hit Comics&quot; was given to Jeb Rivers, a riverboat captain.

===Character origin and powers===
The Kid was originally a nameless boy (who remembered being called only &#x27;Kid&#x27; by his &#x27;Gran&#x27;pa&#x27;) who was killed when a U-boat sank his grandfather&#x27;s fishing boat during World War II. Due to a supernatural mix-up, however, he was killed 75 years too soon.

To rectify the error, the Kid was brought back to life for another 75 years with the mission of upholding good in the world. He was given the power to summon any good historical or mythological figure or animal by saying the word &quot;Eternity&quot; as well as to use the same word to make himself material or immaterial and invisible. Kid Eternity was further assisted on his duties by the clerk who had made the error, Mr. Keeper. He is sometimes shown summoning fictional figures, like Jean Valjean or the Three Witches.

According to &quot;Jess Nevins&#x27; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&quot;, &quot;with the help of people like Sir Launcelot, Merlin and Hercules, [Kid Eternity] fights against crime, evil, the Germans, the super-strong Mr. Puny, Master Man (Satan&#x27;s personal servant, who can summon history&#x27;s greatest villains), and Dr. Pain, the master of agony&quot;.

===Villains===
* Her Highness and Silk: An elderly woman (complete with glasses and white hair) and her young, attractive assistant. Thieves and confidence scammers, the characters were humorous in nature, almost never succeeding in their plans but always willing to try another &quot;get rich quick&quot; scheme. Their first appearance was in &quot;Hit Comics&quot; #27 (April 1943). They were quickly spun off into their own feature; in the next issue, Her Highness was on the cover, and their spin-off lasted until issue #57. In 1982, she and Silk appeared in a Captain Marvel story guest-starring Kid Eternity (&quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; #282).
* Master Man: Kid Eternity&#x27;s opposite number, Master Man was given powers similar to the Kid&#x27;s by the Devil. When Master Man said &quot;Stygia&quot;, he could summon any evil historical or mythological figure from Stygia.
* Thuggoths: Evil creatures, part man, part beast, who were imprisoned in a pyramid 3000 years ago by Tutankhamun, but escape and plan to take over the world, killing experts on Egyptology so it is not known how to kill them. Kid Eternity tracks them to the pyramid, is attacked by one but summons up William Tell who slays it with an arrow, and later summons up Tut, who finally destroys them with fire. He only appears in &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; #1.
* Dr. Marko: A world-renowned scientist who after being paid by foreign agents to set off radio controlled mines in a city harbour, thus killing hundreds of people, is sentenced to hanging. He decides to travel through time to attack America when it was smaller and weaker, and invents a time-globe to travel to the past, although he takes the Kid with him after they realise a mortal is meddling with Eternity, not realising who he is. Marko attempts to change history twice but is foiled. Mr. Keeper then take Marko back to the day of his execution, where he is hanged, and sends the globe far into the future, where men will learn to use its great powers. Dr. Marko appeared only in &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; #2.

* Mr. Keeper&#x27;s evil brother: An evil twin brother of Mr. Keeper, who was banished to Stygia by Mr. Keeper using the Cup of Jove, for rewarding evil and punishing good, but escapes to get revenge and uses his powers to help criminals. He fights Mr. Keeper, distracting him and knocks him out, before binding him and impersonating him. He is banished once more with the Cup of Jove.
* Frank Malone: Leader of a group of kidnappers who kidnap a rich girl, called Kathryn, the Greenbriar heiress, and demand a $50,000 ransom. The Kid foils the Kidnappers, and saves the girl from a fire in the car, even though she was supposed to die that day.

== DC Comics ==

DC Comics acquired Kid Eternity in the 1950s and revived his title in the 1980s. He is revealed to be Christopher Freeman, the brother of Captain Marvel Jr. (Freddy Freeman). Initially depicted as inhabiting Earth-S, Kid Eternity is transported to the main universe following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

In post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Kid Eternity is a servant of the Lords of Chaos, who manipulated him into serving them. Furthermore, the entities he summons are demons who assume the form of the figures he desires.

In &quot;JSA&quot;, Kid Eternity is killed by Mordru. He later returns, but is killed by the Calculator.

In The New 52 continuity reboot, Kid Eternity is a police coroner who can resurrect the dead.

== In other media ==

* Kid Eternity appears in &quot;&quot; #6.
* Kid Eternity appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<doc id="935178" wikidata="Q541987" url="?curid=935178" title="Trypanosoma">
<text>Trypanosoma is a genus of kinetoplastids (class Trypanosomatidae), a monophyletic group of unicellular parasitic flagellate protozoa. Trypanosoma is part of the phylum Euglenozoa. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;trypano-&quot; (borer) and &quot;soma&quot; (body) because of their corkscrew-like motion. Most trypanosomes are heteroxenous (requiring more than one obligatory host to complete life cycle) and most are transmitted via a vector. The majority of species are transmitted by blood-feeding invertebrates, but there are different mechanisms among the varying species. &quot;Trypanosoma equiperdum&quot; is spread between horses and other equine species by sexual contact. They are generally found in the intestine of their invertebrate host, but normally occupy the bloodstream or an intracellular environment in the vertebrate host.

Trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases, including the fatal human diseases sleeping sickness, caused by &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;, and Chagas disease, caused by &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi.&quot;

The mitochondrial genome of the &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, as well as of other kinetoplastids, known as the kinetoplast, is made up of a highly complex series of catenated circles and minicircles and requires a cohort of proteins for organisation during cell division.

==History==

In 1841, Gabriel Valentin found flagellates that today are included in &quot;Trypanoplasma&quot; in the blood of trout.

The genus (&quot;T. sanguinis&quot;) was named by Gruby in 1843, after parasites in the blood of frogs.

In 1903, David Bruce identified the protozoan parasite and the tsetse fly vector of African trypanosomiasis.

== Taxonomy ==
A number of different methods demonstrate that the traditional &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; genus is not monophyletic, with the biflagellate Bodonida nested within. The American and African trypanosomes constitute distinct clades, implying that the major human disease agents &quot;T. cruzi&quot; (cause of Chagas&#x27; disease) and &quot;T. brucei&quot; (cause of African sleeping sickness) are not closely related to each other.

Phylogenetic analyses suggest an ancient split between a branch containing all Salivarian trypanosomes and a branch containing all non-Salivarian lineages. The latter branch in turn splits into a clade containing bird, reptilian and the Stercorarian trypanosomes infecting mammals, and a clade with a branch of fish trypanosomes and a branch of reptilian or amphibian lineages.

Salivarians are trypanosomes of the subgenera of &quot;Duttonella&quot;, &quot;Trypanozoon&quot;, &quot;Pycnomonas&quot; and &quot;Nannomonas&quot;, which are passed to the vertebrate recipient in the saliva of the tsetse fly (&quot;Glossina spp.&quot;). Antigenic variation is a characteristic shared by the Salivaria, which has been particularly well-studied in &quot;T. brucei&quot;. The &quot;Trypanozoon&quot; subgenus contains the species &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;, &quot;T. rhodesiense&quot; and &quot;T. equiperdum&quot;. The subgenus &quot;Duttonella&quot; contains the species &quot;T. vivax&quot;. &quot;Nannomonas&quot; contains &quot;T. congolense&quot;.

Stercorians are trypanosomes passed to the recipient in the feces of insects from the subfamily &quot;Triatominae&quot; (most importantly &quot;Triatoma infestans&quot;). This group includes &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;, &quot;T. lewisi&quot;, &quot;T. melophagium&quot;, &quot;T. nabiasi&quot;, &quot;T. rangeli&quot;, &quot;T. theileri&quot;, &quot;T. theodori&quot;. The subgenus &quot;Herpetosoma&quot; contains the species &quot;T. lewisi&quot;.

The subgenus &quot;Schizotrypanum&quot; contains &quot;T. cruzi&quot; and a number of bat trypanosomes. The bat species include &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma dionisii&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma erneyi&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma livingstonei&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma wauwau&quot;. Other related species include &quot;Trypanosoma conorhini&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma rangeli&quot;.

===Evolution===
The ancestor of modern trypanosomes absorbed a green alga around one billion years ago and co-opted some of its genetic material. This has resulted in modern trypanosomes such as &quot;T. brucei&quot; containing essential genes for the breakdown of sugars that are most closely related to plants. This difference may be used as the target of therapies.

The relationships between the species have not been worked out to date. It has been suggested that &quot;T. evansi&quot; arose from a clone of &quot;T. equiperdum&quot; which lost its maxicircles. It has also been proposed that &quot;T. evansi&quot; should be classified as a subspecies of &quot;T. brucei&quot;.

It has been shown that &quot;T. equiperdum&quot; has emerged at least once in Eastern Africa and &quot;T. evansi&quot; at two independent occasions in Western Africa.

==Hosts, life cycle and morphologies==

Two different types of trypanosomes exist, and their life cycles are different, the salivarian species and the stercorarian species.

Stercorarian trypanosomes infect insects, most often the triatomid kissing bug, by developing in the posterior gut followed by release into the feces and subsequent depositing on the skin of the vertebrate host. The organism then penetrates and can disseminate throughout the body. Insects become infected when taking a blood meal.

Salivarian trypanosomes develop in the anterior gut of insects, most importantly the Tsetse fly, and infective organisms are inoculated into the host by the insect bite before it feeds.

As trypanosomes progress through their life cycle they undergo a series of morphological changes as is typical of trypanosomatids. The life cycle often consists of the trypomastigote form in the vertebrate host and the trypomastigote or promastigote form in the gut of the invertebrate host. Intracellular lifecycle stages are normally found in the amastigote form. The trypomastigote morphology is unique to species in the genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;.

==Meiosis==

Evidence has been obtained for meiosis in &quot;T. cruzi&quot;, and for genetic exchange. &quot;T. brucei&quot; is able to undergo meiosis within the salivary glands of its tsetse fly host, and meiosis is considered to be an intrinsic part of the &quot;T. brucei&quot; developmental cycle. An adaptive benefit of meiosis for &quot;T. crucei&quot; and &quot;T. brucei&quot; may be the recombinational repair of DNA damages that are acquired in the hostile environment of their respective hosts.

<text>Melanie Louise Banville (born June 22, 1987) is a Canadian gymnast who competed at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.

Born in Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, she lived in nearby Long Sault, Ontario and trained in Ottawa, Ontario. Starting gymnastics at age five she was highly motivated by the competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics and then made it her goal to compete in the Olympic Games. Banville&#x27;s twin brother Eric was also a gymnast.

After becoming known as one of Canada&#x27;s best young gymnasts, Banville went to the 2004 Summer Olympics where she finished 24th in the individual all-round competition. Melanie&#x27;s coaches at the Ottawa Gymnastics Center were Tobie Gorman, Lori Ierullo and Matthew Sparks. Matthew Sparks (currently head coach at Cirque du Soleil) also coached Melanie&#x27;s twin brother Eric.

<text>Jdate is an online dating service aimed at Jewish singles. The service is one of a number of demographically focused online match-making websites operated by Spark Networks, Inc.

Because of the focus on relationships between Jewish singles, Jdate is considered a special-interest online dating site. Former CEO Adam Berger calls this type of service &quot;niche&quot; dating.

==History==
Jdate was founded in 1997 by Alon Carmel and Joe Shapira following the failure of their previous venture, Matrix Video Corporation. After the launch, membership grew rapidly by word of mouth in tight-knit Jewish communities.

The site won a 2006 Webby award for social networking.

On November 10, 2014, Jdate launched a dating app designed for Jewish singles.

==Members==
Jdate has members worldwide, with users concentrated in the US and Israel. Individuals do not have to be Jewish in order to join Jdate. While Jdate is oriented towards the Jewish population, it has also attracted those seeking Jewish mates. The reasons cited often have to do with perceived cultural traits, whether stereotypical or true: &quot;nice&quot; or wealthy Jewish men who treat women well; take-charge, and independent Jewish women who hold on to tradition. While many Jdate members respond in kind, others view the phenomenon as an intrusion that defeats the purpose of the site.

Members can mark their Jewish affiliation on their profile. Options include Conservadox, Conservative, Hasidic, Orthodox (Modern, Baal Teshuva and Frum), Reconstructionist, Reform, and &quot;Culturally Jewish&quot;. Members can also select options like &quot;Willing to Convert&quot;.

Jdate members have the option to seek heterosexual or homosexual relationships on the site. Profiles include options like &quot;men seeking men&quot; and &quot;women seeking women&quot; to help users connect with their desired matches.

Past and present celebrity Jdate members include:
* Steve Rothman, American politician, U.S. House of Representatives, from New Jersey
* Brad Sherman, American politician, U.S. House of Representatives from California
* Jesse McCartney, American musician
* Dan Markel, Canadian-born attorney and a law professor, who wrote various works on retribution in criminal law and sentencing, with a focus on the role of punishment in the criminal justice system.

==Operations==
Previously based in Beverly Hills, Spark Networks is now based in Berlin, Germany, with additional offices in Lehi, Utah.

In 2013, the company authorized the repurchase of $5 million of its outstanding common stock as a reflection of confidence in the long-term business.

On November 2, 2017, Spark Networks SE (NYSE American: LOV) announced the successful completion of the previously announced merger of Spark Networks, Inc. and Affinitas GmbH in a stock-for-stock transaction.

<doc id="935187" wikidata="Q347864" url="?curid=935187" title="Edwin S. Porter">
<text>Edwin Stanton Porter (April 21, 1870 – April 30, 1941) was an American film pioneer, most famous as a producer, director, studio manager and cinematographer with the Edison Manufacturing Company and the Famous Players Film Company. Of over 250 films created by Porter, his most important include &quot;What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City&quot; (1901), &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (1902), &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot; (1903), &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903), &quot;The European Rest Cure&quot; (1904), &quot;The Kleptomaniac&quot; (1905), &quot;Life of a Cowboy&quot; (1906), &quot;Rescued from an Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1908), and &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1913).

==Birth and education==
Porter was born and raised in Connellsville, Pennsylvania, to Thomas Richard Porter, a merchant, and Mary (Clark) Porter; he was the fourth of seven children with four brothers (Chales W., Frank, John, and Everett Melbourne) and two sisters (Mary and Ada). Named Edward at birth, he later changed his name to Edwin Stanton, after Edwin Stanton, the Democratic politician from Ohio who had served as Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of War. After attending public schools in Connellsville, Porter worked, among other odd jobs, as an exhibition skater, a sign painter, and a telegraph operator. He developed an interest in electricity at a young age, and shared a patent at age 21 for a lamp regulator. Eventually becoming a merchant tailor, Porter was battered by the Panic of 1893. He filed for bankruptcy on June 15 and enlisted in the United States Navy four days later on June 19. He served three years as a gunner&#x27;s mate, serving on the USS New York (ACR-2) and at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

==Career==
===Early career===
He was employed initially in the electrical department of William Cramp &amp; Sons, a Philadelphia ship and engine building company. During his three years&#x27; service he showed aptitude as an inventor of electrical devices to improve communications.

Porter entered motion picture work in 1896, the first year movies were commercially projected on large screens in the United States. He was briefly employed in New York City by Raff &amp; Gammon, agents for the films and viewing equipment made by Thomas Edison, and then left to become a touring projectionist with a competing machine, Kuhn &amp; Webster&#x27;s Projectorscope. He traveled through the West Indies and South America, showing films at fairgrounds and in open fields. He later made a second tour through Canada and the United States.

Returning to New York City in early 1898, Porter found work at the Eden Musée, a Manhattan wax museum and amusement hall which had become a center for motion picture exhibition and production and licensee of the Edison Manufacturing Company. While at Eden Musée, Porter worked assembling programs of Edison films, most particularly exhibitions of films of the Spanish–American War, Edison productions which helped stir an outbreak of patriotic fever in New York City. As an exhibitor, Porter had tremendous creative control over these programs, presenting a slate of films accompanied by a selection of music and live narration.

===Edison===
Porter joined the Edison Manufacturing Company in November 1900. Soon afterward he took charge of motion picture production at Edison&#x27;s New York studios, operating the camera, directing the actors, and assembling the final print. He collaborated with several other filmmakers, including George S. Fleming. During the next decade Porter became the most influential filmmaker in the United States. From his experience as a touring projectionist, Porter knew what pleased crowds, and he began by making trick films and comedies for Edison. One of his early films was &quot;Terrible Teddy, the Grizzly King&quot;, a satire made in February 1901 about the then Vice President-elect, Theodore Roosevelt. Like all early filmmakers, he took ideas from others, but rather than simply copying films he tried to improve on what he borrowed. In his &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (1902) and &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot; (1903) he followed earlier films by France&#x27;s Georges Méliès and members of England&#x27;s Brighton School, such as James Williamson. Instead of using abrupt splices or cuts between shots, however, Porter created dissolves, gradual transitions from one image to another. In &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot; particularly, the technique helped audiences follow complex outdoor movement. &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, was the first American film to use intertitles which helped the audience follow the story by identifying the scenes and some of the principal characters.

===&quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; and after===
Porter&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903) took the archetypal American Western story, already familiar to audiences from dime novels and stage melodrama, and made it an entirely new visual experience. The one-reel film, with a running time of twelve minutes, was assembled in twenty separate shots, along with a startling close-up of a bandit firing at the camera. It used as many as ten different indoor and outdoor locations and was groundbreaking in its use of &quot;cross-cutting&quot; in film editing to show simultaneous action in different places. No earlier film had created such swift movement or variety of scene. &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was enormously popular. For several years it toured throughout the United States, and in 1905 it was the premier attraction at the first nickelodeon. Its success firmly established motion pictures as commercial entertainment in the United States.

After &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; Porter continued to try out new techniques. He presented two parallel stories in &quot;The Kleptomaniac&quot; (1905), a film of social commentary like his technically more conventional film of 1904, &quot;The Ex-Convict&quot;. In &quot;The Seven Ages&quot; (1905) he used side lighting, close-ups, and changed shots within a scene, one of the earliest examples of a filmmaker departing from the theatrical analogy of a single shot for each scene. He also directed trick films such as &quot;Dream of a Rarebit Fiend&quot; (1906), based on the comic strip by Winsor McCay. Between 1903 and 1907 he successfully demonstrated most of the techniques that were to become the basic modes of visual communication through film. For instance, he helped to develop the modern concept of continuity editing, notably in &quot;The Trainer&#x27;s Daughter; or, A Race for Love&quot; (1907), and is often credited with discovering that the basic unit of structure in film was the &quot;shot&quot; rather than the scene (the basic unit on the stage), paving the way for D. W. Griffith&#x27;s advances in editing and screen storytelling. Yet he seemed to regard them only as separate experiments and never brought them together in a unified filmmaking style. Porter directed future filmmaker Griffith in &quot;Rescued from an Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1908).

===Defender and Rex Film Companies===

In 1909 after tiring of the industrial system set up to feed the booming nickelodeon business, Porter left Edison and founded a company to manufacture Simplex motion picture projectors. In 1910 he founded Defender Film Company, which folded after one year. In 1911 he joined with others in organizing the Rex Motion Picture Company. In 1912 he sold out and accepted an offer from Adolph Zukor to become chief director of the new Famous Players Film Company, the first American company that regularly produced feature-length films. He directed stage actor James K. Hackett in their first feature film, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1913). He also directed Mary Pickford in her first feature film, &quot;A Good Little Devil&quot; (1913), also directing Pauline Frederick and John Barrymore.

===3D movie pioneer===
But his directorial skills had not kept pace with rapid changes in motion picture art, although his technical skills were piqued by 3D. Porter&#x27;s last film premiered on June 10, 1915, &quot;Niagara Falls&quot;, the first 
anaglyph 3D movie. In 1916 he left Famous Players during a reorganization.

===Precision Machine Company===
From 1917 to 1925 Porter served as president of the Precision Machine Company, manufacturers of the Simplex projectors. After his retirement in 1925 he continued to work on his own as an inventor and designer, securing several patents for still cameras and projector devices. During the 1930s he was employed by an appliance corporation.

==Death==

Aged 71, he died in 1941 at the Hotel Taft in New York City and was buried in Husband Cemetery, Somerset, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife, Caroline Ridinger, whom he had married on June 5, 1893; they had no children.

==Legacy==

Porter remains an enigmatic figure in motion picture history. Though his significance as director of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; and other innovative early films is undeniable, he rarely repeated an innovation after he had used it successfully, never developed a consistent directorial style, and in later years never protested when others rediscovered his techniques and claimed them as their own. He was a modest, quiet, cautious man who felt uncomfortable working with the famous stars he directed starting in 1912. Zukor said of Porter that he was more an artistic mechanic than a dramatic artist, a man who liked to deal with machines better than with people.

<text>Li Ning (; born March 10, 1963, in Liuzhou, Guangxi) is a Chinese billionaire entrepreneur, the founder of the eponymous sportswear company Li-Ning, and retired gymnast of Zhuang ethnicity. He lives in Hong Kong.

== Gymnastics career ==
Li Níng started training when he was eight and was selected for the national team in 1980. In 1982, he won six of the seven medals awarded at the Sixth World Cup Gymnastic Competition, earning him the title &quot;Prince of Gymnastics&quot; ().

Li Níng is most famous for winning six medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics, the first Olympics in which the People&#x27;s Republic of China participated. He won three gold medals (in floor exercise, pommel horse, and rings), two silver medals, and one bronze medal. Li became the most decorated Chinese athlete at the first Olympics that China participated in after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic in October 1949.

Li Níng won 11 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships medals, including gold medals in the rings (1985) and team all-around (1983).

Li Níng took part in his second Olympics at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, despite carrying injuries. It ended an illustrious gymnastic career, as he was off-form.

== Post-gymnastics ==
Li retired from sporting competition in 1988, and in 1990 he founded Li-Ning Company Limited, which sells footwear and sporting apparel in China. Li remains chairman of the company&#x27;s board of directors. According to Hurun Report&#x27;s China Rich List 2014, he has an estimated fortune of RMB 5 billion, making him the 407th wealthiest person in China.

Li was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2000, becoming the first Chinese inductee.

In 2017, a statue was erected in his honor on the shores of Lake Geneva in Montreux.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Li Ning ignited the cauldron at the opening ceremony after being hoisted high into the air with cables and miming running around the stadium&#x27;s rim.

== Personal life ==
Li is married to Chen Yongyan, a fellow gymnast who won an Olympic bronze in 1984.

<text>In Harm&#x27;s Way is a 1965 American epic historical romantic war film produced and directed by Otto Preminger and starring John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Patricia Neal, with a supporting cast featuring Henry Fonda in a lengthy cameo, Tom Tryon, Paula Prentiss, Stanley Holloway, Burgess Meredith, Brandon deWilde, Jill Haworth, Dana Andrews, and Franchot Tone. Produced with Panavision motion picture equipment, it was one of the last black-and-white World War II epics, and Wayne&#x27;s last black-and-white film. The screenplay was written by Wendell Mayes, based on the 1962 novel &quot;Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, by James Bassett.

The setting of the film is the entry of the United States into World War II. It depicts the lives of several U.S. naval officers based in Hawaii and their wives or lovers. The title of the film comes from a quote from an American Revolutionary naval commander: 

The film presents a relatively unromantic picture of the U.S. Navy and its officers from the night of December 6, 1941, through the first year of the U.S. participation in World War II, complete with bureaucratic quarreling among the senior officers and sometimes disreputable private actions by individuals. Its sprawling narrative is typical of Preminger&#x27;s works in which he examined institutions and the people who run them, such as the United States Congress and the Presidency of the United States in &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot;, the Catholic Church in &quot;The Cardinal&quot;, and the British Intelligence Service in &quot;The Human Factor&quot;.

==Plot==
U.S. Navy Captain Rockwell &quot;Rock&quot; Torrey is a divorced son of a career chief petty officer. A Naval Academy graduate and career officer himself, Torrey is removed from command of his heavy cruiser for boldly pursuing the enemy but then being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Torrey&#x27;s executive officer, Commander Paul Eddington, is a wayward sort of career officer who has resigned as a naval aviator and returned to the surface navy because of an unhappy marriage. His wife&#x27;s numerous affairs and drunken escapades have become the talk of Honolulu, and her death during the Pearl Harbor attack—in the company of an Army Air Corps officer, with whom she had just had a wild fling on a local beach—drives Eddington into a bar brawl, a stint in the brig, and exile in a hated land-based logistics command.

After several months of desk duty ashore in Hawaii and recuperation from a broken arm he suffered in the attack on his cruiser, Torrey finds his way into a romance with a divorced Navy Nurse Corps lieutenant named Maggie Haynes, who tells him that his estranged son Jeremiah is now an ensign in the Naval Reserve. A strained visit with Jeremiah brings Torrey in on a South Pacific island-hopping offensive codenamed &quot;Skyhook&quot;, which is under command of the overly cautious and micro-managing Vice Admiral B.T. Broderick. On additional information from his roommate, intelligence officer Egan Powell, Torrey guesses that the aim of Skyhook is to capture a strategic island named Levu-Vana, whose central plain would make an ideal airfield for B-17 bomber squadrons. Shortly thereafter, Maggie informs him that her unit is to be shipped out to the same area in preparation for the offensive.

In the summer of 1942, Torrey is promoted to rear admiral and given tactical command of Skyhook, an assignment requiring the same sort of guts and gallantry he previously displayed as commanding officer of his cruiser. He personally selects Paul Eddington to be his Chief of Staff, and infuriates Broderick by immediately planning and executing an operation to overrun Gavabutu, an island to be used as a staging base for the invasion of Levu-Vana. This proves unexpectedly easy as the Japanese have withdrawn their garrisons from Gavabutu. As Torrey turns his attention to Levu-Vana, his attempts to secure more material and manpower are frustrated by General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s simultaneous and much larger campaign in the Solomon Islands. Reconnaissance aircraft prove especially difficult to come by, and surface combatant forces amount to little more than several cruisers and destroyers, including Torrey&#x27;s former command.

Meanwhile, Eddington&#x27;s instability drives him to rape navy nurse Annalee Dorne who is engaged to Torrey&#x27;s son. The traumatized nurse, fearing she might be pregnant, commits suicide with an overdose of sleeping pills. As the truth is about to be revealed, Eddington – still a qualified aviator – commandeers a PBJ patrol bomber and flies solo on an unauthorized reconnaissance flight to locate elements of the Japanese fleet. He goes down in a fiery death in a redeeming act of sacrifice, giving advance warning of a large Japanese task force centered around the super-battleship , on its way to blast Torrey&#x27;s much smaller force off the islands.

Despite the new seaborne threat, Torrey nevertheless mounts the invasion of Levu-Vana and proceeds with a full attempt to turn back the enemy force. Tragically, his son Jere is killed during a nighttime PT boat action. The following morning sees a pitched surface action off the shores of Levu-Vana, with the Americans drawing first blood and the &quot;Yamato&quot; decimating much of the U.S. force in response. Severely injured at the height of the battle, Torrey is rescued by his flag lieutenant, William &quot;Mac&quot; McConnell, and is returned to Pearl Harbor aboard a hospital ship under Maggie&#x27;s devoted care. Expecting to be court-martialed, Torrey is instead congratulated on successfully repelling the Japanese advance and allowing his Marines to take Levu-Vana.

===Uncredited cast===
== Background and production ==
It has been speculated that Wayne&#x27;s low-key performance was due to the fact that he was seriously ill with lung cancer when the film was made. Shortly after filming ended in September 1964, he was diagnosed with the disease and a month later underwent surgery to remove his entire left lung and two ribs. Co-star Franchot Tone was soon to also develop lung cancer and died of the disease in September 1968.

Many of the non-military costumes and hairstyles worn by the women throughout the film were contemporary to the mid-1960s period during which the film was made, rather than of the early 1940s. This is particularly noticeable at the dance which opens the film. Many of the extras in this scene were, in fact, current active duty military officers and their spouses assigned to various commands on Oahu.

The film was shot in black-and-white by Loyal Griggs, who composed his scenes in a wide-screen Panavision format often using deep focus. Griggs was nominated for a Best Cinematographer Academy Award for his work. Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s musical score is also notable, as is the work of Saul Bass in the credit titles sequence (this sequence comes at the end of the film, a departure at the time from the norm in a major Hollywood production).

The film received extensive cooperation from the U.S. Department of Defense, especially the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps, with substantial filming occurring both aboard warships at sea and ashore at Naval Station Pearl Harbor (to include Ford Island) and Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay.

Stanley Holloway played an Australian coastwatcher. A number of coastwatchers appeared on screen in the early 1960s in part due to increased awareness of their role in the war (President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s life had been saved by a coastwatcher).

One of many problems encountered during production was that at the time of the filming (mid and late 1964), very few ships then in active Navy service resembled their World War II configuration of two decades earlier. Only one WW II-vintage heavy cruiser, the , still retained most of her wartime configuration (and as a result she stood in for a couple of unnamed cruisers during the movie) although she didn&#x27;t enter service until 1943, and an accompanying destroyer, , which entered service in 1942, took on the role of USS &quot;Cassiday&quot; were extensively filmed on. Other U.S. Navy ships that participated included the cruiser (though only the forward two-thirds of the ship could be shown as she had missiles installed aft), destroyers , , , , submarine and the attack transport . All of the destroyers had to have their modern (1960s) anti-submarine warfare (ASW) gear covered over with fake gun-mounts or deck houses. Additional smaller vessels were provided in support, as well as an HU-16 Albatross amphibious aircraft painted in World War II markings, even though said aircraft did not enter the U.S. military inventory until 1949. The HU-16 likely substitutes for a PBY Catalina, of which no flyable examples were likely available for the film schedule at that time.

Another anachronism is the widespread use of the M151 light utility vehicle as a World War II jeep instead of the World War II-era Willys MB and/or Ford GPW, the M151 having not even entered production until 1959. Also used were a few 1950s vintage 63-ft U.S. Coast Guard rescue launches that were made over to resemble Elco 80-ft PT boats, as the few that existed were not available for use.

Reference near the start of the film is mentioned to the &quot;picket destroyer &quot;Ward&quot;&quot; dropping depth charges what she believes to be a submarine near the entrance to Pearl Harbor. This refers to which dropped depth charges on what has since been established to be a Japanese two-man mini submarine. The incident appears in the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;. USS &quot;Ward&quot; was sunk by kamikaze action in December 1944.

George Tomasini, one of the film&#x27;s editors, died months before the film was released.

==Reception==
&quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; was nominated for the 1965 Academy Award for Cinematography (Black-and-White) for cinematographer Loyal Griggs. It was also screened at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.

Patricia Neal received a 1966 BAFTA Film Award as Best Foreign Actress for her performance in the film.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. The film holds a 37% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the film, observing, &quot;This is a slick and shallow picture that Mr. Preminger puts forth here, a straight, cliché-crowded melodrama of naval action in the Pacific in World War II ...&quot; and characterized it as &quot;a film that is virtually awash with flimsy and flamboyant fellows with all the tricks of the trade of Hollywood.&quot; However, other reviews have been more positive. Bruce Eder, writing for &quot;Allmovie.com&quot;, notes that &quot;&#x27;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; has endured extraordinarily well for an epic war movie made in the 1960s, owing to a multitude of virtues. For starters, it was the last big-budget, all-star Hollywood movie to be shot in black-and-white, and that gives the film a harder, sharper, more defined edge than it ever could have had if it had been photographed in color...Add to those virtues the unexpectedly lively pacing and stunning special effects...and &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; seems like a very fast-moving two and a half hours&#x27;.

Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote &quot;Preminger&#x27;s latest is simply one more overlong epic of the naval war against the Japanese, with conventional story lines, characters, resolution&quot;.

<text>The Lillie Parsons was an American two-masted schooner which sank in the Saint Lawrence Seaway near Brockville, Ontario, Canada, in 1877.

The ship was launched on September 14, 1868, in Tonawanda, New York. On August 5, 1877, she hit a rock, took on water and sank after her cargo shifted during a squall.

The wreck was discovered on August 6, 1963, by three members of the local diving club, complete with 500 tons of coal on board. She rests at a depth of about , off the shore of Sparrow Island.

<text>Louise McCarren Herring (September 20, 1909 – November 2, 1987), was an Ohio native, recognized as one of the pioneer leaders of the not-for-profit cooperative credit union movement in the United States. Herring is universally regarded in the United States credit union movement as being the “Mother of Credit Unions” for her work with the movement since its earliest days.

==Early life==
Louise McCarren was born to Joseph McCarren. She graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1932.

==Career==
Herring worked in the personnel department of Kroger prior to 1933. Herring also served as the longtime manager of KEMBA (Kroger Employees Mutual Benefit Association) Credit Union in Cincinnati.

===Banking career===
Herring was one of the attendees at the 1934 Estes Park, Colorado, meeting that established the Credit Union National Association (better known as CUNA). Also attending the Estes Park meeting were Edward Filene, Claude Clark, and Dora Maxwell. Herring’s commitment to the value of credit unions elevated her to national leader of the movement. Herring is credited with helping to establish five hundred credit unions and was a supporter of the dual share insurance system, helping to establish the private National Deposit Guaranty Corporation, which is now known as American Share Insurance (ASI).

Herring served as the first paid executive secretary of the Ohio Credit Union League (now Ohio Credit Union System) which she co-founded. She was credited with organizing more than 500 credit unions in Ohio and the Midwest. She was a member of the consumer advisory council of the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington, D.C. She was president of the Communicating Arts Credit Union and treasurer of the Cincinnati Central Credit Union at the time of her death.

==Personal life==
She married Arthur S. Herring on October 21, 1939. They had three sons and two daughters, William A., Joseph G., Robert C., Sister Carren and M. Catherine. She lived in Pleasant Ridge, Cincinnati. She was a member of the Church of the Nativity in Pleasant Ridge.

Herring died on November 2, 1987, at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was buried at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Montgomery, Ohio.

==Awards and legacy==
In 1978, the Ohio legislature recognized Herring as the &quot;Mother of the Ohio Credit Union Movement&quot;. Herring was inducted into the National Cooperative Business Association&#x27;s Cooperative Hall of Fame in 1983. She was named to the Ohio Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1987, she received the YWCA Career Achievement Award.

CUNA annually awards the Louise Herring Award for Philosophy in Action, which recognizes those credit unions which “demonstrate the exceptional effort to integrate credit union philosophy” (not for profit but for service) into the daily operations of their credit unions and recognize their commitment to superior service to their member/owners. The Ohio Credit Union System tri-annually awards the Louise McCarren Herring Lifetime Achievement Award to those individuals who have demonstrated a lifetime dedication to the advancement of the credit union movement in Ohio.

<text>Puzzlewood () is an ancient woodland site and tourist attraction, near Coleford in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England. The site, covering , shows evidence of open-cast iron ore mining dating from the Roman period, and possibly earlier.

Over a mile of pathways were laid down in the early 19th century to provide access to the woods, and provide picturesque walks. The area contains strange rock formations, secret caves and ancient trees, with a confusing maze of paths.

The site is listed as a regionally important geological site in the &#x27;Forest of Dean Local Plan Review&#x27;.

== Geology ==
The geological features on show at Puzzlewood are known as scowles. Scowles originated through the erosion of natural cave systems formed in the Carboniferous Limestone many millions of years ago. Uplift and erosion caused the cave system to become exposed at the surface. This was then exploited by Iron Age settlers through to Roman times for the extraction of iron ore. It is usually impossible to date open-cast extraction precisely, although ores with a chemical signature consistent with those from the Forest of Dean were certainly used to make tools and weapons in the late prehistoric period.

== Roman coins ==

Over 3,000 Roman-era coins were found by workers in 1848. The coins were stored in three earthenware jars in a cavity in the rock formations. The origin of the coins is unknown.

== Literary influences==

&quot;Harry Potter&quot; author J. K. Rowling has also visited Puzzlewood. The Forbidden Forest within the series bears some similarities to the geography of the area. Additionally, the forest is believed to have been an inspiration for J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

== Filming location ==
Puzzlewood has been used as a filming location for both film and television in recent years. Notable examples include:&lt;br&gt;

<text>George Kirke Spoor (December 18, 1871 – 24 November 1953) was an early film pioneer who, with Gilbert M. &quot;Broncho Billy&quot; Anderson, founded Essanay Studios in Chicago in 1907. He was a founding partner of V-L-S-E, Incorporated, a film distribution firm, in 1915.

==Biography==
Spoor and Anderson were responsible for discovering stars such as Wallace Beery, Francis X. Bushman, Ben Turpin, Gloria Swanson and Charlie Chaplin. Allan Dwan, who was hired as a screenwriter, went on to become a famous Hollywood director. Louella Parsons, also hired by Spoor as a screenwriter, later became a famous Hollywood gossip columnist.

In 1894, while box office manager of the Phoenix Opera House in Waukegan, Illinois, George K. Spoor teamed up with the inventor Edward Hill Amet (1860–1948) to build and exhibit &quot;The Magniscope&quot;, the first practical 35 mm movie projector ever designed and used in a large audience display. Spoor and Amet made films and distributed them with this device before the 1895 device by the Lumière brothers of France. Thomas Edison&#x27;s more famous Kinetoscope was exhibited in 1891, but was only able to be viewed by one person at a time through a peephole.

Spoor and Amet are credited for having filmed: the world&#x27;s first newsreel, a film of the first inauguration of President William McKinley in 1897; the first use of film miniatures (&quot;The Battle of Santiago Bay&quot;) in which tin replicas and cigar smoke created the illusion of live war footage; the first to experience local censorship (due to the graphic images of &quot;China&#x27;s Boxer Rebellion&quot;); the first &quot;fake newsreel&quot; in which Spoor used neighbors to act out battles such as the Battle of San Juan Hill in a local park.

Spoor is also remembered for having produced, in 1918, the movie &quot;Men Who Have Made Love to Me&quot; by controversial feminist Mary MacLane, the first serious cinematic work to break the fourth wall. and the first to unite writer, narrator, subject, and star.

In 1926, Spoor and P. John Berggren invented &quot;Natural Vision&quot;, an early 65 mm widescreen process which was only used for a few films, including &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; (1926), &quot;Rollercoaster Ride&quot; (1926), &quot;The American&quot; (1927) and &quot;Danger Lights&quot; (RKO Radio Pictures, 1930). The trademark Natural Vision was later used for an unrelated system of making 3-D films in 1953.

In 1948, Spoor received an Oscar, specifically an Academy Honorary Award, for his contribution to developing motion pictures as entertainment. 

He died on November 24, 1953.

== Selected filmography ==

Spoor is credited with having been the producer of:
* &quot;&quot; (1909), starring Ben Turpin
* &quot;A Burlesque on Carmen&quot; (1915), starring Edna Purviance, directed by Charlie Chaplin
* &quot;Men Who Have Made Love to Me&quot; (1918), starring Mary MacLane, Ralph Graves and Paul Harvey
* &quot;A Pair of Sixes&quot; (1918), starring Taylor Holmes
* &quot;The American&quot; (1927), starring Bessie Love and Charles Ray

<text>Emmi is a Finnish singer-songwriter who sings in English. She was born on October 10, 1979, in Vilppula, Finland. She became famous thanks to her single &quot;Breakable&quot;, which was released in February 2001. In May 2001 her second single &quot;Crashing Down&quot; and her debut album &quot;Solitary Motions&quot; were released. Two other quite well known songs from that album are &quot;Green Car&quot; and &quot;Solitary Motions&quot;. She was nominated as the Best Nordic Act by MTV Europe Music Awards in 2001. However, the award was won by the Danish band Safri Duo.

There are two versions of Emmi&#x27;s second album &quot;No Nothing&quot;. The first one was released only for Finnish market in October 2002. The second one was released for international as well as Finnish market in early 2003. The differences between the versions are the order of songs and the fact that the second version contains two tracks that are not contained in the first version, namely &quot;Into The World&quot; and &quot;World Is Crazy&quot;. Conversely, the song &quot;Toss Me Down&quot; is contained in the first version but not in the second one.

The single &quot;Eileen&quot; was released in 2005. On October 5, 2005, Emmi&#x27;s third album &quot;Can Full of Joy&quot; was released.

<doc id="935232" wikidata="Q1340698" url="?curid=935232" title="Scott Lobdell">
<text>Scott Lobdell (; born 1960) is an American comic book writer and screenwriter known for his work on numerous X-Men series for Marvel Comics in the 1990s, various work for DC Comics in the 2010s, namely &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws, Teen Titans,&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;, and comics for other publishers, including the &quot;Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers&quot; series by Papercutz or &quot;Fathom&quot; by Aspen MLT. He also wrote the script to the 2017 slasher film &quot;Happy Death Day&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
Lobdell did not begin to read comics until he was 17 years old, while lying in bed after lung surgery. Later, he went to college to study psychology, but quit two years later when he began to write. While in college, he wrote for the college newspaper and interviewed Marvel editor Al Milgrom. Lobdell started submitting various stories to Marvel, but was systematically rejected by various editors, including Tom DeFalco. Later, DeFalco started editing Marvel Comics Presents (a bi-weekly book) requiring many writers, pencillers and inkers. Lobdell submitted a story about a character from &quot;Contest of Champions&quot;. Because the characters involved were rather obscure, DeFalco did not need to extract approval from other editors, and he decided to give Lobdell a chance.

===Marvel Comics===
In the 1990s, Lobdell worked on Marvel Comics&#x27; X-Men-related titles, specifically &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and the spin-off series &quot;Generation X&quot;. He wrote the first 28 issues of &quot;Generation X&quot; along with runs on &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;X-Factor&quot;. Lobdell was the primary creative force behind most of the major X-title related storylines throughout a majority of the 1990s, including &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;Fatal Attractions&quot;, &quot;Phalanx Covenant&quot;, &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, the &quot;Onslaught&quot; saga, and &quot;&quot;.

Lobdell had writing stints on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot;,&quot; Alpha Flight&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix&quot; and early issues of issues of &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; during the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; event. Lobdell wrote the 1992 issue of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; in which the superhero Northstar – originally intended to be gay, but closeted by the publisher&#x27;s existing policy against openly LGBT characters – declared that he is gay, in a storyline intended to also address the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Lobdell returned to Marvel in 2001 to conclude plots he left behind with one last storyline, &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;, as well as the epilogue of &quot;X-Men: Gambit&quot;, co-plotted with Joe Pruett with pencils by Georges Jeanty.

===Other work===
Lobdell wrote the script to &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Mosaic&quot; and an upcoming film from POW! Entertainment featuring Ringo Starr. He also participated in the Marvel Comics and Image Comics (from Jim Lee&#x27;s WildStorm) crossover mini-series &quot;WildC.A.T.s/X-Men&quot;.

In 2008 Lobdell became the regular writer for &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, a series published by IDW Publishing, with art by Ilias Kyriazis, centered on the eve of the relaunch of the &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; series, now titled &quot;Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues&quot;.

To date, he has written the majority of The Hardy Boys Graphic Novel series by Papercutz.

Lobdell has also performed as a stand-up comedian.

Lobdell created &quot;Paranormal Activity: The Search for Katie&quot; with art from Mark Badger it was released in December 2009 on iPhone.

Lobdell wrote the screenplay for Blumhouse’s slasher film &quot;Happy Death Day&quot;. The film was released on October 13, 2017 by Universal Pictures.

Lobdell&#x27;s original comic book series &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; sold to Netflix on May 14, 2020. The comic is being adapted into a feature film starring Dwayne &quot;the Rock&quot; Johnson and Emily Blunt. Emily V. Gordon is writing the screenplay.

===DC Comics===
In 2011, Lobdell took on the writing duties for &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot;, which debuted as part of DC Comics&#x27; company-wide title relaunch, The New 52. His portrayal of Starfire/Koriand&#x27;r in the first issue was criticized as shallow and sexist by some critics.

He also wrote a new &quot;Teen Titans&quot; comic starring Red Robin, Superboy, Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, and three new characters, including the gay Hispanic superhero Bunker. His run on Teen Titans ended with Volume 4 Issue 30, the series was relaunched soon afterwards.

In 2019, Lobdell wrote a new &quot;Flash&quot; book focusing on Wally West following the limited series &quot;Heroes in Crisis&quot;, titled &quot;Flash Forward&quot;, which began publication in November.

===Awards===
His work has won him recognition in the comic books industry, such as a nomination for the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; Award for &quot;Favorite Writer&quot; in 1997.

==Controversy==
In 2011, Lobdell explained that among the reasons he no longer had a social media presence was the unintended spillover from his personal to professional life, and a run-in he had had with writer Ron Marz on Twitter. Lobdell had accused Marz of having a &quot;brain tumor&quot; in response to comments in which Marz characterized as &quot;racist&quot; complaints by some fans that Afro-Latino character Miles Morales would replace Peter Parker in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, and that African-American actor Laurence Fishburne had been cast as Perry White in the film &quot;Man of Steel.&quot;

In 2013, Lobdell admitted to sexually harassing comic book artist/writer MariNaomi on stage during a Prism Comics panel at Long Beach Comic Con. MariNaomi had submitted an article to XoJane describing how they had felt harassed by an unnamed fellow panelist, who had questioned their sexuality on stage, made offensive comments about their appearance and Asian features, and made sexually inappropriate jokes about them during the panel. Lobdell later identified himself as the panelist in question, and issued an apology to MariNaomi through Heidi MacDonald of ComicsBeat.com.

<text>James Scott Skinner (5 August 1843 – 17 March 1927) was a Scottish dancing master, violinist, fiddler and composer. He is considered to be one of the most influential fiddlers in Scottish traditional music, and was known as &quot;the Strathspey King&quot;.

==Early years==
Skinner was born on 5 August 1843 in Arbeadie in the parish of Banchory, Aberdeenshire, the youngest of six children. His father William Skinner was a dancing teacher. His mother, Mary Skinner (née Agnew) originally came from Strathdon. His father died in 1845. When his mother remarried seven years later, he moved to Aberdeen where he lived with his sister Annie and attended Connell&#x27;s School.

His elder brother Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Forbes Skinner gave him lessons in violin and cello, and he started playing at local dances with local fiddler Peter Milne.

==Career ==
Three years later he left to join Dr Mark&#x27;s Little Men, a travelling orchestra. This involved spending six years intensive training at their headquarters in Manchester. It also involved touring round the UK. The orchestra gave a command performance before Queen Victoria at Buckingham on 10 February 1858. Skinner attributed his own later success to meeting Charles Rougier in Manchester, who taught him to play Beethoven and other classical masters. Finally he took a year&#x27;s dancing tuition from William Scott. Skinner could now earn his living as a dancing master for the district around Aberdeen.

In 1862 he won a sword-dance competition in Ireland. The following year he won a strathspey and reel competition in Inverness. Gradually he broadened his district of clients until Queen Victoria learned of his reputation. She requested him to teach callisthenics and dancing to the royal household at Balmoral. In 1868 he had 125 pupils there. In the same year his first collection of compositions was published. By 1870 he had married and was soon living in Elgin. For twelve years he continued as a dancing master and violinist. He gave virtuoso concerts, with his adopted daughter joining him as a pianist. In 1881 his wife became seriously ill and died a couple of years later. For the next ten years he spent little time in any one place. The 1880s did see three more collections of tunes published. In 1893 he toured the United States with Willie MacLennan, the celebrated bagpiper and dancer.

After returning to Scotland he virtually gave up dancing and concentrated on the fiddle. In 1897 he remarried and wrote some of his best work. In 1899 he made his first cylinder recordings. In 1903, he wrote one of his best known tunes, Hector the Hero, a lament for Scottish Major-General Hector MacDonald, a friend of Skinner&#x27;s who committed suicide following accusations of homosexuality. In 1904, Skinner published The Harp &amp; Claymore Collection, his biggest collection of music, edited by Gavin Greig.

In the period from 1906 to 1909 he lived a settled life in Monikie but had so little money that he could not afford to publish his work. He sent manuscripts to friends who copied them out and played them to create a market. Those precious scraps of paper, the backs of envelopes and hand-bills are now in museums. Skinner frequently used the word &quot;genius&quot; to describe himself. This might explain the fact that in 1909 his wife &quot;resigned&quot; and moved to Rhodesia. He threw himself into another round of concert tours. Several of his 1910 recordings for Columbia in London are available on a CD on the Temple label. These include traditional tunes as well as his own works, presenting a unique window into early twentieth century fiddle playing and probably back to the 1850s.

In 1925 he was still top of the bill on five tours of the UK. Skinner entered a reel and jig competition in the United States in 1926. He immediately had musical differences with the pianist and strode off stage without completing his test pieces. He died on 17 March 1927 without giving another public performance. His body was buried in Aberdeen, where his marble memorial gravestone, by the artist and sculptor Frederick William George, was unveiled by Sir Harry Lauder.

==Publications ==
Over 600 of his compositions were published, among the best known being &quot;The Bonnie Lass of Bon Accord,&quot; &quot;Cradle Song,&quot; &quot;Bovaglie&#x27;s Plaid,&quot; &quot;The Music o&#x27; Spey,&quot; and &quot;Hector the Hero.&quot; He made over 80 recordings.

<text>The Icy Strait is a strait in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska, at about .

==Geography==
Icy Strait separates Chichagof Island to the south and the Alaska mainland to the north. The strait is from its west side at the intersection of the Cross Sound and Glacier Bay to its east side at Chatham Strait and the Lynn Canal. The two largest islands in the strait are Pleasant Island and Lemesurier Island.

The Cape Spencer Light is an important former lighthouse and remains an active aid to navigation.

The nearby cruise ship destination Icy Strait Point is named in reference to Icy Strait.

==History==

At 9:57 p.m. on September 13, 1886, the sidewheel steamer , a cargo liner, ran aground on an uncharted rock in Icy Strait within of Point Gustavus while attempting to enter Glacier Bay. After three hours, she floated free on the rising tide at 1:00 a.m. on September 14, and her captain beached her on a sandy shore about from the rock to prevent her from sinking. She was refloated on October 2, 1886, and, after initial repairs, run ashore again in Bartlett Cove for additional repairs. She finally proceeded to Juneau, Alaska, for permanent repairs. A United States Coast and Geodetic Survey team sent to chart the rock in November 1886 named it &quot;Ancon Rock,&quot; and a buoy moored at the site now warns ships of the submerged Ancon Rock. &quot;Ancon&quot; returned to service in mid-December 1886.

The cruise ship &quot;Empress of the North&quot; ran aground near Rocky Island and took on some water there on May 14, 2007, causing the evacuation of her passengers. None were injured.

<doc id="935261" wikidata="Q2166799" url="?curid=935261" title="Simon Mann">
<text>Simon Francis Mann (born 26 June 1952) is a British mercenary and former officer in the SAS. He trained to be an officer at Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Scots Guards. He later became a member of the SAS. On leaving the military, he co-founded Sandline International with fellow ex-Scots Guards Colonel Tim Spicer in 1996. Sandline operated mostly in Angola and Sierra Leone, but a contract with the government of Papua New Guinea attracted a significant amount of negative publicity in what became known as the Sandline affair.

On 7 March 2004, Mann is alleged to have led the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup attempt. He was arrested by Zimbabwean police in Harare airport along with 64 other mercenaries. He eventually served three years of a four-year prison sentence in Zimbabwe, and less than two years of a 34 years and four months sentence in Equatorial Guinea.

==Early life==
Simon Mann&#x27;s father, George, captained the England cricket team in the late 1940s and was an heir to a stake in the Watney Mann brewing empire that closed in 1979, having been acquired by Grand Metropolitan (which, in 1997, became Diageo plc on its merger with Guinness). His mother, Margaret, was South African.

==Military career==
After leaving Eton College, Mann trained to be an officer at Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Scots Guards on 16 December 1972. By 1976, he held the rank of Lieutenant. He later became a member of the SAS and served in Cyprus, Germany, Norway and Northern Ireland before leaving the forces in 1985. He volunteered as a reservist for the Gulf War.

==Post-military career==
===Executive Outcomes===
Mann then entered the field of computer security; however, his interest in this industry lapsed when he returned from his service in the Gulf and he entered the oil industry to work with Tony Buckingham. Buckingham also had a military background and had been a diver in the North Sea oil industry before joining a Canadian oil firm. In 1993, UNITA rebels in Angola seized the port of Soyo, and closed its oil installations. The Angolan government under José Eduardo dos Santos sought mercenaries to seize back the port and asked for assistance from Buckingham who had by now formed his own company.

===Sandline International===

Mann went on to establish Sandline International with fellow ex-Scots Guards Colonel Tim Spicer in 1996. The company operated mostly in Angola and Sierra Leone, but in 1997 Sandline received a commission from the government of Papua New Guinea to suppress a rebellion on the island of Bougainville and the company came to international prominence, but received much negative publicity following the Sandline affair. Sandline International announced the closure of the company&#x27;s operations on 16 April 2004. In an interview on the &quot;Today Programme&quot;, Mann indicated that the operations in Angola had netted more than £10,000,000.

==Equatorial Guinean coup attempt==
On 7 March 2004, Mann and 69 others were arrested in Zimbabwe when their Boeing 727 was seized by security forces during a stop-off at Harare&#x27;s airport to be loaded with £100,000 worth of weapons and equipment. The men were charged with violating the country&#x27;s immigration, firearms and security laws and later accused of engaging in an attempt to stage a coup d&#x27;état in Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, fourteen suspected mercenaries, one of whom later died in prison, were detained in Equatorial Guinea in connection with the alleged plot. Mann and the others claimed that they were not on their way to Equatorial Guinea but were in fact flying to the Democratic Republic of Congo to provide security for diamond mines. Mann and his colleagues were put on trial in Zimbabwe, and, on 27 August, Mann was found guilty of attempting to buy arms for an alleged coup plot and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. 66 of the others were acquitted.

On 25 August 2004, Sir Mark Thatcher, son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was arrested at his home in Cape Town, South Africa. He eventually pleaded guilty (under a plea bargain) to negligently supplying financial assistance for the plot. The 14 men in the mercenary advance guard that were caught in Equatorial Guinea were sentenced to jail for 34 years.

Among the advance guard was Nick du Toit who claimed that he had been introduced to Thatcher by Mann. Investigations later revealed in Mann&#x27;s holdings&#x27; financial records that large transfers of money were made to du Toit, as well as approximately US $2 million coming in from an unknown and untraceable source. On 10 September, Mann was sentenced to seven years in jail. His compatriots received one-year sentences for violating immigration laws and their two pilots got 16 months. The group&#x27;s Boeing 727 was seized, as well as the US$180,000 that was found on board the plane.

===Exposure===
A friend of Mann, Nigel Morgan, who has ties to the South African Secret Service, was alleged to have betrayed his knowledge of the plot to the South African authorities. The journalist Adam Roberts has argued that Morgan was in the unusual situation of being both a supporter of the coup and also an agent for the government, and that Mann knew Morgan was acting as an informant, but as a way of sounding out whether or not the South African government would care. 

Academic R.W. Johnson, on the other hand, argued that only the &#x27;shambolic state of the South African intelligence services&#x27; explains why an aborted 19 February attempt by Mann – which fell apart when a plane set to meet them in Zambia suffered a bird strike – was allowed to get off the ground in Polokwane Airport. He emphasises that Morgan had personal and professional ties to Johann Smith, a South African Special Forces veteran and security adviser to President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, and most likely alerted President Thabo Mbeki after the failed first attempt, who in turn tipped off the government of Robert Mugabe.

Peter Fabricius, writing in the &quot;South African Journal of International Affairs&quot;, suggested that then President South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, once informed of Mann&#x27;s plan, allowed the plotters to take off and then be caught on the tarmac in Zimbabwe, in order to make a public example of the Wonga coup and deter further mercenary activity.

===Charges dropped and extradition===
On 23 February 2007, charges were dropped against Mann and the other alleged conspirators in South Africa. Mann remained in Zimbabwe, where he was convicted of charges from the same incident. On 2 May 2007, a Zimbabwe court ruled that Mann should be extradited to Equatorial Guinea to face charges, although the Zimbabweans promised that he would not face the death penalty. His extradition was described as the &quot;oil for Mann&quot; deal, in reference to the large amounts of oil that Mugabe has managed to secure from Equatorial Guinea. Mann lost his last appeal against the decision to extradite him. In a last-ditch effort on 30 January 2008, Mann tried to appeal the judgment to the Zimbabwean Supreme Court. The following day, Mann was deported to Equatorial Guinea in secret, leading to claims by his lawyers that the extradition was hastened to defeat the possibility of appeal to the Supreme Court. In Equatorial Guinea Mann was incarcerated in Black Beach Prison, one of Africa&#x27;s most notorious prisons and often viewed as synonymous with brutality.

===Response by UK Parliamentarians===
Concern for Mann&#x27;s plight was raised in the UK Parliament in the year of his arrest in Zimbabwe by three Conservative Members of Parliament. During the two years after the government of Equatorial Guinea applied for his extradition, three further Conservative Party MPs submitted written questions.

The sudden extradition drew the greatest response. Julian Lewis said in Parliament: 
That position was supported by three other Conservative MPs during the debate. Written questions were submitted by a fourth.

There was a request that the United States administration, which had access to Simon Mann in Black Beach Prison on 6 February 2008, exert its influence &quot;to secure [his] safe return&quot;. UK officials were granted access to him on 12 February 2008. Labour and other parties expressed little concern about Mann or the others. The only non-Conservative Party MP to submit a question in Parliament about him was Vince Cable, although an Early Day Motion about his treatment in prison received some cross-party support.

On 8 March 2008, Channel 4 in the UK won a legal battle to broadcast an interview with Mann in which he named British political figures, including Ministers, alleged to have given tacit approval to the coup plot. In testimony, he spoke frankly about the events leading to the botched attempt to topple Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s president.

Despite their charges being unrelated, Mann was tried alongside six Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea activists being held on weapons charges, including opposition leader Severo Moto&#x27;s former secretary Gerardo Angüe Mangue. On 7 July 2008, Mann was sentenced by an Equatoguinean court to more than 34 years in prison.

===Release===
On 2 November 2009, he was given &quot;a complete pardon on humanitarian grounds&quot; by President Obiang. He lives in New Forest.

===Release of emails and unpublished memoirs===
In 2024, Mann provided &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; with access to emails and unpublished memoirs providing additional information. On the 20th anniversary of the coup attempt, the newspaper published an article on the coup.

==In popular media==
* In 2002, Mann played Lieutenant-Colonel Derek Wilford of the Parachute Regiment for Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, a dramatisation by Paul Greengrass of the events of Bloody Sunday.
* The alleged coup planned for Equatorial Guinea is the subject of the film &quot;Coup!&quot;, written by John Fortune. Mann is played by Jared Harris, with Robert Bathurst as Mark Thatcher. It was broadcast on BBC Two on 30 June 2006 and on ABC in Australia on 21 January 2008.
* Mann was interviewed from prison in the documentary &quot;Once Upon A Coup&quot;, which aired on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Wide Angle&quot; in August 2009.

==Memoirs==
Mann&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Cry Havoc&quot;, was published in 2011, to mixed reviews.

<text>John Amery (14 March 1912 – 19 December 1945) was a British fascist and Nazi collaborator during World War II. He was the originator of the British Free Corps, a volunteer Waffen-SS unit composed of former British and Dominion prisoners of war.

Amery conducted recruitment efforts, and made propaganda broadcasts for Germany. He later gave direct support to Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. He was prosecuted by the British authorities and pleaded guilty to eight counts of high treason, for which he was sentenced to death, seven months after the war in Europe ended.

==Early life==
Born in Chelsea, London, John Amery (known as &quot;Jack&quot;) was the elder of two children of British statesman Leo Amery (1873–1955), a member of parliament and later Conservative government minister; Leo&#x27;s mother was a Hungarian Jew who had converted to Protestantism. John&#x27;s younger brother, Julian (1919–1996), also became an MP and served in a Conservative government.

Amery was a difficult child who ran through a succession of private tutors. He attended nursery (kindergarten) at Miss Ironside&#x27;s School, whose eponymous headmistress described him as &quot;unteachable&quot;. Like his father, he was sent to Harrow, but left after only a year, being described by his housemaster as &quot;without doubt, the most difficult boy I have ever tried to manage.&quot; Living in his father&#x27;s shadow, he strove to make his own way by embarking on a career in film production. Over a period, he set up a number of independent companies, all of which failed; these endeavours rapidly led to bankruptcy.

At the age of 21, Amery married Una Wing, a former prostitute, but was never able to earn enough to keep her for himself. He was constantly appealing to his father for money. A staunch anti-Communist, he came to embrace the doctrines of Nazi Germany on the grounds that they were the only alternative to Bolshevism. He left Britain permanently to live in France after being declared bankrupt in 1936. In Paris, he met the French fascist leader Jacques Doriot, with whom he travelled to Austria, Italy, and Germany to witness the effects of fascism in those countries.

Amery told his family he had joined Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and was awarded a medal of honour while serving as an intelligence officer with Italian volunteer forces (Corpo Truppe Volontarie). He actually worked for Franco as a liaison with French Cagoulard groups and gun-runners. After the Spanish war, Amery settled in France.

==Second World War==
===Occupied France===
Amery remained in France following the German invasion in June 1940. On 22 June, the Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed between France and Germany. Amery resided in the territory belonging to the collaborationist Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe Pétain. However, his personality soon antagonised the Vichy Regime, so he made several attempts to leave but was not allowed. The head of the German Armistice Commission offered Amery a chance to live in Germany to work in the political arena but he was unable to get Amery out of occupied France.

In September 1942, &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Werner Plack gained Amery the French travel permit he needed, and in October Plack and Amery travelled to Berlin to speak to the German English Committee. It was at this time that Amery suggested that the Germans consider forming a British anti-Bolshevik legion. Adolf Hitler was impressed by Amery and allowed him to remain in Germany as a guest. During this period, Amery made a series of pro-German propaganda radio broadcasts, attempting to appeal to the British people to join the war on communism.

===British Free Corps===

The idea of a British force to fight the communists languished until Amery re-encountered Jacques Doriot during a visit to France in January 1943. Doriot was part of the LVF (&quot;Légion des Volontaires Français&quot;), a French volunteer force fighting alongside the Germans on the eastern front.

Amery rekindled his idea of a British unit and aimed to recruit 50 to 100 men for propaganda purposes and to establish a core of men with which to attract additional members from British prisoners of war. He also suggested that such a unit could provide more recruits for the other military units made up of foreign nationals.
Amery&#x27;s first recruiting drive for what was initially to be called the British Legion of St George took him to the Saint-Denis POW camp outside Paris. Amery addressed between 40 and 50 inmates from British Commonwealth countries and handed out recruiting material. This first effort at recruitment was a complete failure, but he persisted.

Amery&#x27;s drive for recruits found two men, of whom only one, Kenneth Berry, joined what was later called the BFC. Amery&#x27;s link to the unit ended in October 1943, when the Waffen SS decided his services were no longer needed, and it was officially renamed the British Free Corps.

===Arrest===
Amery continued to broadcast and write propaganda in Berlin until late 1944 when he travelled to Northern Italy to lend support to Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Salò Republic. On 25 April 1945, Amery was captured along with his French mistress Michelle Thomas by Italian partisans from the Garibaldi Brigade near Como. Amery and Thomas were initially to be executed, but both of them were eventually sent to Milan, where they were handed over to Allied authorities. Amery was wearing the uniform of the &quot;Muti Legion&quot;, a fascist paramilitary organisation. The British army officer who took him into custody was Captain Alan Whicker, later known as a broadcaster.

Amery was returned to the United Kingdom by air. With him on the flight was William Joyce, the propaganda broadcaster widely known as &quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;. They were escorted by three armed soldiers and Leonard Burt, a senior police officer seconded to the British Army Intelligence Corps.

===Prosecution and execution===
Amery was prosecuted for treason in London. In a preliminary hearing, he argued that he had never attacked Britain and was an anti-Communist, not a Nazi. At the same time, his brother Julian attempted to show that John had become a Spanish citizen, and therefore would legally be incapable of committing treason against the United Kingdom.

His counsel, Gerald Osborne Slade KC, meanwhile, tried to show that the accused was mentally ill. Amery&#x27;s sanity was questioned by his own father, Leo, but all efforts to have the court consider his mental state were unsuccessful. Further attempts at a defence were suddenly abandoned on the first day of his scheduled trial, 28 November 1945, when to general astonishment, Amery pleaded guilty to eight charges of treason, and was sentenced to death. The hearing lasted just eight minutes.

Before accepting Amery&#x27;s guilty plea, the judge, Mr Justice Humphreys, made certain that Amery realised the only permissible penalty would be death by hanging. After satisfying himself that Amery fully understood the consequences of pleading guilty, the judge announced this verdict:
Amery was hanged in Wandsworth Prison on 19 December 1945 by executioner Albert Pierrepoint and buried in the prison cemetery. Amery actually quipped as he was led to the scaffold, &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to meet you, Mr Pierrepoint, though not of course under these circumstances!&quot; In 1996, Julian Amery had his brother&#x27;s remains exhumed and cremated, scattering his ashes in France.

An epitaph by his father appears in &quot;The Empire at Bay. The Leo Amery Diaries. 1929–1945&quot;:
==Cultural references==
Ronald Harwood&#x27;s play &quot;An English Tragedy&quot;, charting the weeks leading up to Amery&#x27;s execution following his arrest in Italy and trial in London, adapted for radio by Bert Coules, was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 8 May 2010 and 13 April 2012. The cast included Geoffrey Streatfeild as Amery and Sir Derek Jacobi as Leo Amery.

<doc id="935268" wikidata="Q1248471" url="?curid=935268" title="Love Is a Many Splendored Thing (TV series)">
<text>Love Is a Many Splendored Thing is an American daytime soap opera that aired on CBS from September 18, 1967, to March 23, 1973. The series was created by Irna Phillips, who served as the first head writer. She was replaced by Jane Avery and Ira Avery in 1968, who were followed by Don Ettlinger, James Lipton and finally Ann Marcus. John Conboy served as producer for most of the show&#x27;s run.

==Beginnings and controversy==
The serial was a spin-off from the original 1955 20th Century-Fox film, although its title omitted the hyphen found in the film&#x27;s title. In turn, the film was based on the 1952 autobiographical novel &quot;A Many-Splendoured Thing&quot; by Han Suyin. The show was originally a coproduction of CBS and 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s television division.

&quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; focused on lives and loves in San Francisco, California. Its title sequence showed the title over a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge, with a slightly reworked rendition of the film&#x27;s signature hit theme. In a rare move for daytime serials of the era, live shots of junk boats from Hong Kong were interspersed with pictures of the real San Francisco. In 1968, when CBS became sole producer and distributor of the show, its more well-known sequence was introduced showing just the picture of the Golden Gate Bridge. A revised version of the theme song was played by Eddie Layton, the long-time organist at Yankee Stadium and a popular recording artist. Layton played the Hammond X-66 (then owned by CBS) throughout most of his time on the program.

Veteran serial writer and creator Irna Phillips was hired to adapt the film for television, picking up the story some years after the end of the film. In the beginning, the star of the show was Nancy Hsueh as Mia Elliott, daughter to the characters portrayed by William Holden and Jennifer Jones in the 1955 film. Mia left Hong Kong to study medicine in San Francisco, her late father&#x27;s hometown, and there she became involved with two men: Vietnam War pilot Paul Bradley, and, later, Dr. Jim Abbott. However, CBS censors balked at an interracial love story between a white man and an Amerasian woman. The network was also uncomfortable with a developing subplot in which Jim Abbott was implicated in the death of a young patient, the result of a botched abortion. Unwilling to compromise her story for CBS executives, Phillips quit the series, as the character of Mia Elliott was written out of the series in March 1968, never to be mentioned again. Phillips&#x27; resignation led to the end of Fox&#x27;s role as coproducer and distributor.

In February 1968, Phillips was replaced by husband-and-wife writing team Jane and Ira Avery, who quickly refocused the series on two families, the Donnellys and the Elliotts. The Donnelly family was headed by widower Dr. Will Donnelly (Judson Laire), who had three adult children: Tom, a police lieutenant, Iris, a troubled college graduate and Laura, a fragile novitiate nun. The Elliotts consisted of wealthy Phillip and Helen Elliott and their son Mark (Sam Wade), a Vietnam War vet who was engaged to marry Iris but secretly desired her sister Laura. As with the Mia Eliott story, &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; courted controversy again as Laura tried unsuccessfully to fight off carnal desires for her sister&#x27;s boyfriend. A storm of controversy necessitated Laura&#x27;s sudden departure from the church, and CBS dropped the storyline within weeks of Phillips&#x27; departure. However, the Averys continued to focus on the conflict between two beautiful sisters who loved the same man, a plot that would bring the series strong fan devotion as well as a spike in the Nielsen ratings, and would drive the plotline for the remainder of the serial&#x27;s network run.

==Storyline synopsis==
1967: Mia Elliott, daughter of late war correspondent Mark Elliott and physician Han Suyin, arrives in San Francisco to study medicine. Mia meets Phillip and Helen Elliott, her aunt and uncle, cousin Mark Elliott, her father&#x27;s namesake, and sisters Iris and Laura Donnelly. At first Mia dates pilot Paul Bradley (Nicholas Pryor), but she later develops a serious relationship with Dr. Jim Abbott (Robert Milli). Laura Donnelly, also known as Sister Cecilia (Donna Mills), fights her attraction to Mark Elliott as she prepares to take her final vows. Iris, unsure of Mark&#x27;s feelings for her and sensing Laura&#x27;s attraction to him, begins to drink heavily and consort with sneering playboy Jock Porter (John Karlen). During an argument with Mark, a drunken Iris crashes their car, but both escape serious injury.

1968 : When it is revealed that Jock Porter paid Jim Abbott to perform an illegal abortion on girlfriend Terry Andrews, who later died, a disenchanted Mia decides to return to Hong Kong. Iris becomes emotionally involved with Jim, but the scandal surrounding Terry Andrews forces him to leave San Francisco for New York. Laura decides not to take her final vows and leaves the church for Mark, who ends his relationship with Iris and begins a career as an architect. Lt. Tom Donnelly (Robert Burr) helps Helen (Grace Albertson, Gloria Hoye) overcome her grief when husband Phillip (Len Wayland) dies suddenly, and after a short courtship, the two marry. Iris finds herself attracted to Spencer Garrison (Michael Hanrahan, Ed Power) a handsome lawyer/senatorial candidate trapped in an unhappy marriage.

1969: Laura and Mark (now played by David Birney) marry, and shortly afterward, Laura discovers that she&#x27;s pregnant. Spence leaves his insidious wife Nancy (Susan Browning) for Iris, who also becomes pregnant. During a flight to Lake Tahoe, Spence and Iris&#x27; private plane crashes, resulting in a serious brain injury that leaves Iris blinded. Mark has an extramarital affair with Jean Garrison (Jane Manning), the stepmother of Spence, that is publicly exposed after Jean&#x27;s ex-husband Steve Hurley (Mark Gordon, Paul Stevens) is murdered. Mark&#x27;s trial for murder causes Laura to miscarry their baby and have a nervous breakdown. Later, learning that she can never carry another child, Laura instigates divorce proceedings. After Iris learns that her brain injury will cause her death within a year, she and Spence agree that their baby would be better off with childless Laura; however, the court rejects the adoption on the grounds that Laura will be a single mother. Iris persuades Mark and Laura to reconcile for the sake of her baby, and gives birth to William Alex Garrison (Arthur Benoit, Jr.). Andy Hurley (Don Scardino, Russ Thacker) works for the &#x27;Garrison for Senator&#x27; campaign and falls in love with Nikki Cabbott (Jody Locker), a ballerina who later is revealed to be his illegitimate sister. They plan to leave San Francisco, but she drops dead onstage while dancing.

1970: Tom (now played by Albert Stratton)&#x27;s relationship with Helen is strained by the arrival of his ex-wife Martha, an out-of-work actress now calling herself Julie Richards (Beverlee McKinsey). Julie threatens to sue for custody of their son Ricky (Shawn Campbell) if Tom and Helen don&#x27;t pay her off. After Laura and Mark gain custody of Iris and Spence&#x27;s son Billy (played by Thomas Beirne III), Iris is cured from experimental laser surgery performed by brilliant neurosurgeon Dr. Peter Chernak (Paul Michael Glaser, Michael Zaslow, Vincent Baggetta). Will is smitten with Peter&#x27;s mother Lily (Diana Douglas), while Peter&#x27;s independent sister Dr. Betsy Chernak (Andrea Marcovicci) also joins the hospital staff. When Iris demands that Laura give up custody of Billy (Thomas Beirne III), Laura goes insane and kidnaps the child, nearly killing them both in a car crash. Tom is arrested for the murder of Julie&#x27;s conniving boyfriend Jim Whitman (Berkeley Harris), but eventually Julie confesses that she accidentally killed him during a violent argument, and she leaves town.

1971: A contrite Laura (now played by Veleka Gray) submits to psychiatric therapy and agrees to adopt a baby with husband Mark (now played by Michael Hawkins). Iris (now played by Bibi Besch) and Laura are delighted when their father Will marries Lily Chernak (Diana Douglas). Peter Chernak romances sweet Angel Allison (Suzie Kay Stone) and marries her, but has an extramarital fling with Jean Garrison. During their separation Angel is dating Dr. Doug Preston (Gene Lindsey). Visiting an orphanage, Laura and Mark decide to adopt a young girl named Maria (Judy Safran), unaware that she has a very troubled past. Laura then miraculously gets pregnant again. Jealous of Mark, Maria subtly manipulates tension into the Elliott marriage, and when she&#x27;s unsuccessful at separating the couple, she locks Mark in the garage and sets it on fire, but Mark is ultimately saved. Maria is quickly turned in by her best friend Tommy Hale (Chris Pape). When Laura confronts Maria about trying to kill Mark in the fire, she chases her down the steps and falls. As a result of the fall, Laura suffers her second miscarriage. She is committed to a sanitarium. Tom decides to leave the police force and pursue a law degree.

1972: Betsy Chernak begins a stormy romance with Joe Taylor (Leon Russom) who runs a children&#x27;s daycare but also works for Senator Al Preston, Spence&#x27;s opponent in the Senatorial primary campaign and older brother of Dr. Doug Preston. Laura (now played by Barbara Stanger) is now out of the sanitarium and despondent over being childless. She drives Mark (now played by Tom Fuccello) to drink heavily. One night in a drunken stupor, he mistakes Iris for Laura and rapes her, resulting in a pregnancy. Fearing that the scandal will harm his chances for election in the 1972 Senatorial election, Iris agrees to keep the rape a secret and pass off the baby as Spence&#x27;s child. However, blackmailer Walter Travis (John Carpenter) forces Joe Taylor into recording a meeting at Spence and Iris&#x27;s apartment that ends up being cancelled when instead it turns out to be a conversation between Iris and Betsy, revealing Mark as a rapist and father of Iris&#x27; baby she is carrying. Travis plans to use the tape to get Spence to drop out of the race but the plan backfires when Senator Al Preston dies in a car crash. Peter reconciles with Angel, and they settle down in wedded bliss with their baby daughter, Nicole. Joe confides to Betsy that Walter Travis is blackmailing him over the murder of Travis&#x27; wife, Joe&#x27;s lover, seven years ago. Iris gives birth to a baby girl she names Maggie. Spence finally wins the election to become San Francisco, California&#x27;s next state senator.

1973 : While under Betsy&#x27;s care in the hospital for minor surgery, Walter Travis is murdered with an overdose of Demerol. Fearing that Joe&#x27;s possible involvement in Travis&#x27; wife&#x27;s murder will surface, Betsy confesses to the crime. Tom agrees to represent Betsy, who confesses the truth to him. Tom and Joe discover that Travis actually murdered his wife, not Joe, and later prove that Al Preston&#x27;s secretary Celia Winters (Abigail Kellogg) killed Travis. Joe promises Iris and Mark that Laura and Spence (now played by Brett Halsey) will never hear the truth about Maggie&#x27;s parentage, but before she&#x27;s committed to a sanitarium, a deranged Celia reveals the truth to Laura. Iris&#x27;s ex-flame Dr. Jim Abbott (Ron Hale) returns to San Francisco nearly five years later along with his fiancée, Holly McCallister (Joan McMonagle), yet he never forgot Iris and pursues her even though she&#x27;s married to Spence, who is now a state senator. Joe leaves the daycare to become Spence&#x27;s administrative assistant while Holly becomes his secretary. Desperate for a baby, Laura schemes with Jim to get custody of Maggie after he figures out through a medical record that Mark is her biological father; however, Tom arranges a private adoption for Laura and Mark, and Laura reconciles her differences with Iris. Laura and Mark adopt a baby boy they name Philip Elliot. Peter learns that Angel has incurable cancer and vows to make her last days the happiest of her life.

In the final telecast on March 23, 1973, Joe and Betsy, surrounded by all of their friends and family, are married in a beautiful outdoor ceremony. Judson Laire, as Dr. Will Donnelly, steps out of character and addresses the audience, &quot;There go Betsy and Joe, off to a new life. I think this is probably the happiest moment for the Donnellys and the Chernaks, the Garrisons, and the Elliotts, and the Taylors. But, it&#x27;s a very sad moment for those of us actors who played those characters. I think by now most of you must know that &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; is going off the air with this episode. On behalf of my fellow actors, I would like to tell you how much we enjoyed the privilege of coming into your home for these five and half years. It&#x27;s not going to be easy for us; it&#x27;s hard to say goodbye. But, maybe we&#x27;ll live on in your memories. It now becomes my sad duty to say goodbye to you on behalf of the entire company: the cast, the crew, the production staff, the writers and the directors ... all of us. Goodbye, and God bless you.&quot;

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; owed its existence to CBS daytime head Fred Silverman, who openly favored serials over game shows. Its predecessor at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time was the original run of &quot;Password&quot;, which had run aground against NBC&#x27;s serial &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Newlywed Game.&quot; However, &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; struggled against its competition and could not maintain the viewers from its lead-in, the top-rated serial &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

On September 11, 1972, CBS moved &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; to 3:00 p.m. ET. Procter &amp; Gamble, which produced four of the network&#x27;s serials, wanted its shows aired consecutively. CBS moved &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, which had been airing at 2:30 p.m. ET since its expansion to 30 minutes in 1968, into &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot;&#x27;s former 2:00pm timeslot and moved &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; from its longtime 3:30 p.m. ET slot to 2:30 p.m. to complete the request; the schedules of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which aired at 1:30 p.m., and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, which aired at 12:30 p.m., were unaffected and the network did not program the 30 minutes between those shows. Shortly before the time change, the show&#x27;s subject matter was changed from a love story to political intrigue and blackmail. Despite having maintained fairly strong ratings throughout its run, averaging an 8.5 rating and 29% share, &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; still struggled in its new timeslot of 3:00 p.m. against two new competitors: ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot;, which consistently won the timeslot. These same two soaps also competed against sister CBS soap &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; in this timeslot six years earlier. On February 12, 1973, CBS announced that &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; would end its run on March 23.

The lead characters on &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; were recast multiple times. The departure of stars Charleson, Birney and Mills led to a revolving door of cast replacements, such as Bibi Besch. The show focused upon other characters, such as the strong-willed Betsy Chernak Taylor (Andrea Marcovicci), and complex storylines involving politics and blackmail, but its ratings failed to recover quickly enough to avoid cancellation.

Immediately after the cancellation, CBS moved the highly popular &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; into the vacant timeslot.

==Legacy==
The show is notable for its strong focus on young characters. Along with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; particularly targeted young viewers along with soap operas&#x27; traditional audience. The show predated the premieres of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1968) and &quot;All My Children&quot; (1970), two other soap operas that also attracted young audiences.

Organist Eddie Layton introduced the influences of jazz and pop music to the show&#x27;s score in contrast to the heavy symphonic and theatrical organ style of more established soap operas. Later soaps would continue to move away from organ music to contemporary light orchestral and synthesizer-based scoring.

==Surviving episodes==
All 1,430 episodes of &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; were recorded on videotape at the CBS Broadcast Center Studio #41 in New York City. As with most soap operas of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the show&#x27;s tapes were routinely wiped for reuse. Although the master tapes were erased, some rare kinescopes of episodes remain in the possession of private collectors. Only seven videotapes of the series are confirmed to exist, archived as non-circulating copies at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The archived episodes were telecast on March 8, 16 and 24, 1971, April 1 and 9, 1971 and March 12 and 20, 1973.

A 1967 kinescope episode in the public domain episode may be viewed at the Internet Archive.

<text>Royal Air Force Leconfield or more simply RAF Leconfield is a former Royal Air Force station located in Leconfield (near Beverley), East Riding of Yorkshire, England. 

The site is now used by the MoD Defence School of Transport Leconfield or [[Defence School of Transport|DST Leconfield]].

==History==
Leconfield opened on 3 December 1936 as part of RAF Bomber Command with Handley Page Heyford bombers from No. 166 Squadron RAF using the airfield from January 1937 until early September 1939. 

===Second World War===

On the night of 3 September 1939, the first night of the war, ten Whitley bombers from Leconfield became the first British aircraft to penetrate German airspace, dropping propaganda leaflets over Germany. In October 1939 it was taken over by RAF Fighter Command and the Supermarine Spitfire I&#x27;s of 72 squadron arrived from RAF Church Fenton. During the Battle of Britain, the station was a temporary home to many other squadrons of Fighter Command which made short stays here to rest and re-group. During this period there was also a decoy airfield at nearby Routh.

During the war the RAF squadrons based at Leconfield were: 
* No. 51 Squadron between 20 April 1945 and 21 August 1945 with the Short Stirling Mk.V before moving to RAF Stradishall.
* No. 166 Squadron between 20 January 1937 and 17 September 1939 using the Handley Page Heyford III before switching to the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley I in June 1939 and moving to RAF Abingdon.
* No. 196 Squadron between 22 December 1942 and 19 July 1943 flying the Vickers Wellington X before moving to RAF Witchford.
* No. 234 Squadron reformed at Leconfield on 30 October 1939 with the Fairey Battle, Bristol Blenheim IF, Gloster Gauntlet II before settling on the Supermarine Spitfire Mk. I. The squadron moved to RAF Church Fenton on 22 May 1940.
* No. 466 Squadron between 22 December 1942 and 3 June 1944 with the Handley Page Halifax II/III before moving to RAF Driffield.
* No. 610 Squadron between 29 August 1941 and 14 January 1942 with the Supermarine Spitfire IIA/VB before moving to RAF Hutton Cranswick.
* No. 640 Squadron formed at the airfield on 7 January 1944 with the Halifax III before switching to the Mk. VI in March 1945 and disbanding on 7 May 1945.

The station was also the place of formation of the Polish No. 302 Squadron &quot;Poznański&quot;, and the place of rest of the Polish No. 303 &quot;Kościuszko&quot; Squadron after it had its turn in the defence of London. One of 303&#x27;s pilots, Tadeusz Sawicz, was at the time of his death in 2011 believed to be the last surviving Polish pilot to have fought in the Battle of Britain.

===Post War===
In the 1950s Leconfield was a nominated &#x27;dispersal base&#x27; for the RAF V bomber force. Also, after being transferred from RAF Catfoss in October 1945, and into the early 1950s, it was home to the Central Gunnery School which, among other functions, trained air gunnery instructors in Wellington bombers and pilot attack instructors in Spitfire and Mosquito aircraft. This school was later transformed into the Fighter Weapons School. The aircraft then flown were mainly single-seat Venoms and Meteors, plus twin-seat Vampire T11, Meteor trainers and Hawker Hunters for trials with ADEN cannons in 1957. Bristol Sycamore HR 14 helicopters of No. 275 Squadron RAF arrived on 9 October 1957 before being re-equipped with the Westland Whirlwind HAR 4 in March 1959 with the HAR 2 version being added in August 1959, however on 1 September 1959 the squadron was disbanded.

On 29 June 1959 19 Squadron joined with their Hawker Hunter F.6&#x27;s before being re-equipped with the English Electric Lightning F.2 in December 1962 and moving to RAF Gütersloh on 23 September 1965, being joined at RAF Gütersloh by No. 92 Squadron on 24 January 1968 which had also been stationed at Leconfield with their Hunter F.6&#x27;s also later FGA9&#x27;s (The Blue Diamonds). It then became home to No. 60 Maintenance Unit RAF (MU) and also 202 &#x27;B&#x27; Flight with Westland Whirlwind helicopters. 60MU was responsible for the major servicing of the EE/BAC Lightnings, plus several other tasks. No. 202 Squadron became the first SAR unit to rescue people off of Britain&#x27;s first offshore oil rig, the &quot;Sea Gem&quot;. The rig had capsized on the 27 December 1965 and the crew of a Whirlwind rescued three men from the freezing water in a horrendous snowstorm. The crew were later awarded medals and commendations for their actions.

In the 1970s the control tower at Leconfield developed a reputation for being haunted by a Flight Lieutenant who had been killed, along with an airman passenger, when a Meteor 7 he was piloting crashed when coming into land in 1956. 

In July 2024, a former Commanding Officer of RAF Leconfield, Group Captain John &quot;Paddy&quot; Hemingway, at the age of 105 would be recognized as the last surviving RAF fighter pilot of the Battle of Britain.

RAF Leconfield closed on 1 January 1977.

RAF Leconfield archive footage from summer 1961 shows Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother going to tea at the home of Sgt Denys French and family, including his daughter Dawn French, aged 3 years and 9 months. A section of the footage was included in French&#x27;s comedy tour/video &quot;Thirty Million Minutes&quot;.

==Units==
The following units were here at some point:
==Current role==

Leconfield is now home to the Defence School of Transport (DST Leconfield) and is one of the Schools that make up the Defence College of Logistics Policing and Administration (DCLPA) it is a Tri-Service establishment. DST Leconfield is Europe&#x27;s largest driver training establishment, the accommodation is designated as Normandy Barracks.

Although flying operations were not the main role of Leconfield, two Sea King helicopters of &#x27;E&#x27; Flight, 202 Sqn were based here in the Search and Rescue role however this changed as a private company took over the services and the aircraft were retired. Flying operations ceased on 1 April 2015 with the departure of the two Sea King helicopters. The Search and rescue function has been assumed by the Maritime and Coastguard agency based at Humberside Airport.

<text>Comet Giacobini–Zinner (officially designated as 21P/Giacobini–Zinner) is a periodic comet in the Solar System. It was discovered by Michel Giacobini, who observed it in the constellation of Aquarius on 20 December 1900. It was recovered two orbits later by Ernst Zinner, while he was observing variable stars near Beta Scuti on 23 October 1913.

== Physical properties ==
The comet nucleus is estimated to be in diameter. During its apparitions, Giacobini–Zinner can reach about the 7-8th magnitude, but in 1946 it underwent a series of outbursts that made it as bright as 5th magnitude. It is the parent body of the Giacobinids meteor shower (also known as the Draconids). The comet currently has a minimum orbit intersection distance to Earth of .

During the apparition of 2018, the optical spectra have revealed the comet is depleted in carbon-chain molecules and carbon dioxide, likely indicating its origin in relatively warm portion of the Solar system.

== Exploration ==

Giacobini–Zinner was the target of the International Cometary Explorer spacecraft, which passed through its plasma tail at a distance of on 11 September 1985, becoming the first comet ever visited in space exploration. Earlier in the same month the comet was observed by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter. In addition, Japanese space officials considered redirecting the &quot;Sakigake&quot; interplanetary probe toward a 1998 encounter with Giacobini–Zinner, but that probe lacked the propellant for the necessary maneuvers and the project was abandoned.

== 2025 Perihelion ==
21P/Giacobini-Zinner will next pass perihelion on 25 March 2025, and will have its closest approach to Earth 4 days before, on 21 March. It is expected to brighten to magnitude ~11.
