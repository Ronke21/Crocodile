<text>Pendragon, or King Arthur Pendragon, is a Tabletop role-playing game (RPG) in which players take the role of knights performing chivalric deeds in the tradition of Arthurian legend. It was originally written by Greg Stafford and published by Chaosium, then was acquired by Green Knight Publishing, who in turn passed on the rights to White Wolf Publishing in 2004. White Wolf sold the game to Stewart Wieck in 2009. Wieck formed Nocturnal Media, who updated and reissued the 5th edition originally published by White Wolf. In 2018, it returned to Chaosium.

After it was published in 1985, &quot;Pendragon&quot; won several industry awards, and reviewers highly recommended it; in following years, it was included in several &quot;Best of&quot; industry lists.

== Setting ==
Like several other RPGs from Chaosium (most notably &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;), &quot;Pendragon&quot; has a literary basis, in this case the fifteenth-century Arthurian romance, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. It studiously avoids fantasy RPG cliches in favor of its source material. This has caused it to become something of a cult game, even within the narrow confines of the RPG market.

Adventures are often political, military, or spiritual in nature, rather than dungeon crawls, and are often presented as taking place congruently with events from Arthurian legend.

An important part of the game is the time between adventures, during which player characters manage their estates, get married, age, and have children. Typically, the characters will have one adventure per year, and campaigns often carry over across generations, with players retiring their character and taking the role of that character&#x27;s heir. This is quite different from most role-playing games, where one set of characters is played fairly intensively, and there is typically little consideration made of what happens to their family or descendants. The influence of this idea can be seen in the &quot;Ars Magica&quot; RPG, which also encourages stories taking years or decades to unfold (and which is also set in medieval Europe).

The default &quot;Pendragon&quot; setting is a pastiche of actual fifth- and sixth-century British history, high medieval history (10th to 15th centuries), and Arthurian legend. The political forces are roughly those actually present in sub-Roman Britain: Celts fighting Germanic, Irish, and Pictish invaders in the wake of the collapse of Roman authority. However, Technology and many aspects of culture progress in an accelerated fashion, such that King Arthur&#x27;s Britain is depicted as thoroughly feudal. Knights bear unique coats of arms, joust in tournaments, follow chivalric customs, and pursue courtly love. In effect, many trappings of the milieu in which the Arthurian romances were composed are projected backwards. Many of the campaign events and personalities come from the great mass of Arthurian literature composed from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. That being said, it is also possible to run a &quot;Pendragon&quot; campaign set firmly in the Dark Ages or in a more fantastic vision of Arthurian Britain.

== System ==
The rules system of &quot;Pendragon&quot; is most notable for its system of personality traits and passions that both control and represent the character&#x27;s behavior. Otherwise, it uses fairly traditional game mechanics for normal play, based to some degree on the &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; (&quot;BRP&quot;) system. It also has a set of charts and tables for determining what happens to a character&#x27;s family in between adventures. The characters&#x27; ability scores are based on the &quot;BRP&quot; standard, but skills are resolved using d20, rather than d100.

===Personal Traits===

These are thirteen opposing values that represent a character&#x27;s personality. The Traits are: Chaste / Lustful, Energetic / Lazy, Forgiving / Vengeful, Generous / Selfish, Honest / Deceitful, Just / Arbitrary, Merciful / Cruel, Modest / Proud, Pious / Worldly, Prudent / Reckless, Temperate / Indulgent, Trusting / Suspicious, and Valorous / Cowardly. The values on the left side are Virtues and the values on the right are Vices. The Traits are 1-20 points split between the opposing values (e.g., 10/10, 14/6, 5/15). For every point above 10 on a Virtue, a point must be placed below 10 on another Virtue. Characters start during character creation with a base of 15/5 in Valorous/Cowardly (because they are heroes), a base of 13/7 in their Religious Virtues (because they are the good guys) and a base score of 10/10 in the remaining values.

A d20 roll is made to use a Virtue (e.g., Merciful to show mercy towards a captive mortal enemy) or resist a Vice (e.g., Deceitful to deceive a friend). If the roll is at or below the value, it Succeeds and the desired result occurs. If the roll exceeds the value, it is a Failure and the opposite result occurs. If a Virtue or Vice is rated at 20, the opposite is rated at 0; any roll on this trait is automatically successful (e.g., an Energetic character&#x27;s attempt to persist in a difficult or arduous task) or automatically unsuccessful (e.g., an Indulgent character who must use Temperate to resist gluttony or intoxication). This is congruent with Arthurian legend, in which a hero&#x27;s weaknesses are his downfall (like Lancelot&#x27;s lust for Guenevere) or a villain has a moment of nobility (like King Uriens of Gore showing mercy to Prince Arthur rather than striking him down).

The Chivalric Virtues are: Energetic, Generous, Forgiving, Just, Modest, Temperate, and Valorous. Characters possessing point values in these seven Virtues totaling above 80 are granted a bonus to Chivalry rolls.

The Chivalric Vices are: Lazy, Selfish, Vengeful, Arbitrary, Cruel, Proud, and Cowardly. Characters possessing point values in these seven Vices totaling above 80 suffer a penalty to Chivalry rolls.

The Christian Religious Virtues are: Chaste, Forgiving, Merciful, Modest, and Temperate. Christian Characters possessing one or more of these traits at a value of 16+ gain a Religious bonus.

The Romantic Virtues are: Forgiving, Generous, Honest, Just, Merciful, and Trusting. Characters possessing point values in these six Virtues totaling above 65 are granted a bonus to Romance rolls.

Later on, other cultures were added for players who wanted to play a non-Christian character.
* The Pagan Religious Virtues are Lustful, Energetic, Generous, Honest, and Proud. This covers British and Welsh pagans.
* The Heathen Religious Virtues are Vengeful, Honest, Arbitrary, Proud, and Worldly. This covers Saracens and Picts.
* The Wotanic Religious Virtues are Generous, Honest, Proud, Worldly, Reckless and Indulgent. This covers Germanic and Scandinavian pagans.

===Passions===

Passions are higher values that influence a character&#x27;s behavior. They are generated by rolling 2d6+6 or 3d6 (creating a base range between 3 and 18) and adding or subtracting various modifiers.

Passions roll on a d20, just like Traits. If a character fails a Passions roll, he goes into a state of Melancholy (hopeless depression) for violating his core belief. A critical failure or failed attempt to recover from Melancholy can lead to Madness, which forces the character to go into retirement until such time as he can redeem his actions or be forgiven by those he wronged.

*&quot;Loyalty&quot; is a sense of duty to obey a liege, ally, or friend. 
*&quot;Love&quot; is a feeling of affection for another person (a parent, sibling, friend, or lover) or people (allies / followers, friends, or family members) that the character has strong emotional ties to. 
*&quot;Love (Family)&quot;, an affection for family members, is common for daughters and firstborn sons. 
*&quot;Hospitality&quot; is the courtesy of providing shelter, lodging, and protection towards a guest. 
*&quot;Honor&quot; is a sense of duty towards following the rules of proper and noble behavior. 
Later editions added new Passions. 
*&quot;Amor&quot; is Romantic love for a person, replacing &quot;Love&quot; for a lover. 
*&quot;Hate&quot; is the obsessive dislike for a person, nation, or race.

A character&#x27;s Passion is often used to create dissonance and conflict. An example would be a Loyal knight faithfully obeying a cruel order from his unjust liege (or an Honorable knight refusing to do so, no matter the reason or excuse). Another would be an Hospitable host giving protection to a rude and discourteous guest (or an enemy who abuses the custom for insidious ends).

===Magic and Magic-Users===

Only the fourth edition of &quot;Pendragon&quot; included mechanics for magic and magician characters. All other versions of the game, including the later fifth edition, assumed that the character was a knight or lady and restricted magic to game master-controlled characters.

===Character Generation===

The first through fourth editions allowed random character generation of characters from a wide variety of cultures of Great Britain and western Europe, which was expanded by later supplements. The fifth edition supports only point-based creation of young landholding knights from the default homeland of Salisbury, which was a preferred option in the third and fourth editions as well. The supplement &quot;Book of Knights and Ladies&quot;, self-published by Greg Stafford in 2008, allows creation of more diverse characters for fifth edition.

The regions of Logres, Cumbria, and Cambria profiled in the following three supplements were internal to Arthur&#x27;s realm, and thus used standard character generation.
* &quot;Savage Mountains&quot; (1991) - Cambria (Wales); Welsh characters.
* &quot;Perilous Forest&quot; (1992) - Cumbria (Northern Britain); describes the lands of Cumbria (Northwest Britain) and Northumberland (Northeast Britain).
* &quot;Blood and Lust&quot; (1995) - Logres (Southern Britain); loosely describes the lands of Lindsey, East Anglia, Middle Anglia, Mercia, and Wessex and the Saxon Shore of Essex, Sussex and Kent.

Over its history the game spawned a number of supplements dealing with areas within or beyond Arthurian Britain and creating characters outside the culture of the Celtic Britons:
* &quot;Pagan Shore&quot; (1994) - Ireland; Irish character generation, including Feudal Irish and two types of tribal peoples: the &quot;Cruithni&quot; (Irish Picts) and &quot;Lochlannach&quot; (somewhat ahistorical Norse raiders).
* &quot;Beyond the Wall: Pictland &amp; The North&quot; (1995) - Pictland (Caledonia, roughly modern Scotland); Pictish character generation.
* &quot;Land of Giants&quot; (1996) - Scandinavia and the Nordic areas of Britain during the era of &quot;Beowulf&quot;; Northmen character generation.
* &quot;Saxons!&quot; (1999) - The origins of Anglo-Saxon England (Southeast Britain); Jute (Jutland), Angle (Schleswig-Holstein), Frisian (Friesland), Saxon (Germany) &amp; Frankish (France) character generation.

== Publication history ==
The first edition was a boxed set published by Chaosium in 1985, and was designed and written by Greg Stafford. Chaosium planned a second edition, with minor changes to the rules, but this was never actually released. They released a third edition, with rules revised by Stafford, as a single softbound book in 1990. The fourth edition, published by Chaosium in 1993 and reprinted by Green Knight Publishing in 1999, was also released as a softbound manual: the core rules remained consistent with the third edition, but the book was expanded to include rules for player-character magicians and for advanced character-generation (the latter had originally appeared separately in the third-edition supplement &quot;Knights Adventurous&quot;). Green Knight Publishing also released a cut-down version of the fourth edition aimed at beginning players, &quot;The Book of Knights.&quot;

Original designer Greg Stafford produced a much-streamlined fifth edition, which was published as a hardcover book by White Wolf in December 2005. The most notable supplement for this edition is &quot;The Great Pendragon Campaign&quot;, a massive (432-page) hardcover scenario book which details events, adventures and characters from Uther Pendragon&#x27;s reign in 485 through to the end of the Arthurian era. In Ownership passed from White Wolf to Nocturnal Media. In 2017 Nocturnal Media Kickstarted . Using the Pendragon rules system, it is set in medieval Europe with players playing young Frankish squires or knights in the service of Charlemagne. The Pendragon line returned to Chaosium in 2018.

In 2020, a Quickstart preview for a sixth edition was published by Chaosium. In June 2023, Chaosium released a sixth edition boxed starter set.

==Reception==
In the December 1985 issue of &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, Graham Staplehurst gave an effusive review, saying despite the very high price (£25.95) &quot;Pendragon&quot; &quot;looks to be one of the best systemised role-playing games around.&quot; Staplehurst liked the fact that the Arthurian background was generally known by players already, and lauded the research done in order to produce a timeline, and British folk beasts. He called the character generation system &quot;adept.&quot; Staplehurst gave an overall rating of 9 out of 10, saying, &quot;I would not hesitate to recommend the game to any rolegaming aficionado... were it not for the dreadful price.&quot;

In the March 1986 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 107), Ken Rolston was effusive in his praise, calling it &quot;in subject, mechanics, and presentation... the best designed, most attractive, and most effective traditional role-playing game I have ever seen. The process of playing the game, from the reading of the Player’s Book through the creation of a character to the playing of a simple introductory scenario, was one of the most satisfactory role-playing experiences of my life.&quot; Rolston noted the simplified combat system, saying &quot;&quot;Pendragon&quot; has attractively simple and streamlined versions of conventional RPG combat mechanics while offering innovative mechanics supporting role-playing and character development. (If you are interested in the wargaming aspect of fantasy role-playing, you may prefer another system with greater detail in combat mechanics and with player-character magic.)&quot; He concluded by recommending it: &quot;In presentation, &quot;Pendragon&quot; is attractive and pleasurable reading. The &quot;Pendragon&quot; boxed set is an excellent value, certainly one of the most important RPG releases of 1985, and belongs on every serious fantasy role-playing gamer’s shelf.
In the February–March 1987 edition of &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 77), Steven List recommended it, saying, &quot;It presents ample opportunity for both desperate combat and imaginative interactive play, with an orientation different from the typical fantasy campaign.&quot;

Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Pendragon&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #7 (1987), rating it a 10 out of 10 and stated that &quot;Pendragon is as perfect a game as I have ever played. It is obviously a labor of love. Designer Greg Stafford is obviously well versed in the Arthurian legends.&quot;

&quot;The Games Machine&quot; reviewed &quot;Pendragon&quot; and stated that &quot;In &quot;Pendragon&quot; Greg Stafford and friends have produced a truly outstanding game, treating their theme with all the respect and thoroughness it deserves. Any gaming group with an interest in the Arthurian theme should give this game a try.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this game &quot;a masterful design ... that perfectly captures the grandeur and romance of the era.&quot; Swan noted that the game &quot;places an extraordinary emphasis on actual role-playing as opposed to resolving violent confrontations.&quot; Swan concluded by giving &quot;Pendragon&quot; his top rating of 4 out of 4, saying, &quot;With brilliant game mechanics, a gorgeous presentation, and remarkable insight, &quot;Pendragon&quot; is as close to a work of art as a role-playing game can get.&quot;

Stewart Wieck reviewed the 2nd edition of &quot;Pendragon&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #24 (Dec./Jan., 1990), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;Pendragon&quot; had my unreserved approval and appreciation. If you play fantasy RPGs, then you MUST play &quot;Pendragon&quot;. Even if you are not very interested in the Athurian saga, the quality of roleplaying that this game promotes is something that you should expose yourself to.&quot;

Chris Hind reviewed the fourth edition of &quot;King Arthur Pendragon&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #41 (March, 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;the fourth edition of &quot;King Arthur Pendragon&quot; is an excellent value. For [the price], you get a complete system - playable rules, a detailed and intriguing campaign setting, various character types, an introductory adventure and story ideas.&quot;

Andrew Rilstone reviewed &quot;Pendragon&quot; 4th Edition for the British games magazine &quot;Arcane&quot;, and commented, &quot;Every rule and every bit of background meshes together to produce a game in which you can&#x27;t help but think and act and even feel - like one of King Arthur&#x27;s knights.&quot; Rilstone concluded by giving it an excellent rating of 9 out of 10 overall, saying, &quot;Running a full campaign, and seeing the young squires from the first session growing up to be the veterans in the final battle, has been one of the best experiences in my roleplaying career.&quot; Rilstone comments that 

Later that year, in a reader poll conducted by &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the top 50 role-playing games of all time, &quot;Pendragon&quot; was ranked 12th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented, &quot;Pendragon is a game with a huge amount of charm. It&#x27;s extremely character orientated, and so players have the opportunity to spend time developing a separate persona, rather than having to deal with too much action. It has intrigue and complicated plots, but these are geared around the characters instead of merely being an excuse for the characters to do something.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named &quot;Pendragon&quot; as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Underrated Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring said, &quot;&quot;Pendragon&quot; is one of the few RPGs that has a moral point of view ... And it&#x27;s a great melding of game system with game world.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Gaming Report&quot; called the 5th edition of &quot;Pendragon&quot; one of the &quot;Best Retreads&quot; in 2006.

Over twenty years after its publication, &quot;Pendragon&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Shannon Appelcline stated, &quot;&quot;King Arthur Pendragon&quot; could be lauded as a top RPG solely based upon the innovation it brought to the industry. Its concentration on epic storytelling and its traits mechanic were both notable and original when the game was released in 1985. However, even today, &quot;Pendragon&quot; remains vital. It provides a picture-perfect model of literary knighthood and, through its well-crafted and well-considered design, effortlessly conjures its theme — so successfully, in fact, that few other publishers in the last 20 years have even tried to bring another Arthurian roleplaying game to market. You just can&#x27;t improve on perfection.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Pendragon&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, John ONeill said &quot;&quot;Pendragon&quot; had lots of interesting ideas. The game mechanics included ways to trigger powerful passions — love, hate, and loyalty — in your player character, which could in turn produce feats of valor, acts of mercy or cowardice, cruelty, and much more.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath warned, &quot;This endeavor, of course, is not for everyone. If a player has no interest in the legends of Arthur or the romance of knighthood, &quot;Pendragon&quot; will likely bore them to tears.&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;There is very little daylight between the mechanics of the game and the narratives it encourages, which is why &quot;Pendragon&quot; is a perfect game, &quot;for what it aims to be&quot; ... I can think of no other roleplaying game that so deftly marries theme, system and source material.&quot;

==Awards==
*At the 1986 Origins Awards, the supplement &quot;The Pendragon Campaign&quot; won &quot;Best Roleplaying Supplement of 1985.&quot;
*At the 1991 Origins Awards, the third edition of &quot;Pendragon&quot; won &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1990.&quot;
*In 2007, the revised and retitled supplement &quot;The Great Pendragon Campaign&quot; won the Diana Jones Award for &quot;excellence in gaming.&quot;

==Pendragon Fiction Line==
The Pendragon fiction series was a trade paperback line that offered reprints of &quot;lost&quot; classics of Arthurian fiction, as well as original novels and anthologies.

Thompson served as consulting editor for the entire series. Green Knight hired James Lowder to direct the line as executive editor in 1999.

<doc id="904401" wikidata="Q6200911" url="?curid=904401" title="Jimmy Naifeh">
<text>James O. Naifeh (born June 16, 1939) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party from the State of Tennessee. He served as the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1991 to 2009, serving longer in that position than anyone else in Tennessee history.

==Early life==

Naifeh is a second-generation Lebanese-American from Covington, a town north of Memphis. His family was in the grocery business. After graduating from the University of Tennessee, Naifeh served in the United States Army as an infantry officer.

==Political career==

===Election to the House===
He was first elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1974, and was Speaker from 1991 to 2009. He represents House District 81, which includes most of Tipton County and all of Haywood County. Prior to his election as Speaker served in other positions in the Democratic Caucus such as chairman of the Rules Committee, Majority Floor Leader, and chairman of the Rural West Tennessee Democratic Caucus.

===Marriage===
From 1995 to 2008, Naifeh was married to Betty Anderson, considered by many Tennessee political observers to be the most influential lobbyist in the state.

===Contested 2004 election===
In December 2002, African American physician Jesse Cannon, a Republican and Naifeh&#x27;s personal doctor, announced that he would oppose Naifeh in 2004. On November 2, 2004, Naifeh defeated Cannon by a margin of approximately 58% to 42%.

===Republican majority in 2008===
In the 2008 November elections Republicans won the majority of the state House, winning 50 of the 99 seats, with the Democrats holding 49. This is the first time the GOP has had a majority in the Tennessee House since 1971, and the first time both House and Senate have had Republican majorities since Reconstruction. This ended Naifeh&#x27;s long term as Speaker, but the Republicans&#x27; narrow majority in the House did not allow them to elect their preferred Speaker. While 49 Republicans voted for Jason Mumpower, the 49 Democrats and Republican Representative Kent Williams voted for Williams to succeed Naifeh as Speaker.

Naifeh, who was chairing the House for the last time, helped to engineer Williams&#x27; election by instructing the House clerk to depart from the normal practice of conducting a roll call of the members in alphabetical order, instead calling first on the Democrats, then on the Republicans. This allowed Williams to vote last, so that before he voted he knew that his vote for himself would be the deciding vote.

===Retirement===

On March 8, 2012; Naifeh announced he would not run for a 20th term in November.

<text>Oscar Augustus Constantine Lund (May 21, 1885 – May 2, 1963) was a Swedish-born silent film actor, screenwriter and director of the American and Swedish motion picture industry.

==Early life==
Oscar A. C. Lund was born May 21, 1885, in Gothenburg, Sweden, the son of Swedish actor and theater director Carl Ludvig Lund (1858–1893). He emigrated in 1900 to the United States. 

==Career==
Lund joined the burgeoning motion picture industry, directing his first film in 1912 titled &quot;The Wager&quot;. The following year, Lund filmed &quot;The Great Unknown&quot; in Canada.

Lund also wrote the screenplay as well as acted in many of the films he directed. In 1917 he wrote &quot;Mother Love and the Law&quot; based on a real life child-custody case in Illinois.
Between 1912 and 1924, Lund directed more than 60 films in the United States. These included the first feature film made by the New Jersey–based U.S. division of the French Éclair Film Company in 1914 titled &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;. He was a director and writer for &quot;Together&quot; (1918), &quot;The Nature Girl&quot; (1918) and &quot;Peg of the Pirates&quot; (1918). He frequently worked with director and screenwriter B. A. Rolfe (1879–1956) and with the British actress Barbara Tennant (1892–1982), directing her in more than half a dozen films.

Lund was a member of the New York brank of the Motion Picture Directors Association and served as Outer Guard in 1922.

Lund returned to Sweden in 1931, and to filmmaking, directing his first and only talkie, a Swedish language film titled &quot;Kärlek och dynamit&quot; (1933).

Lund died May 2, 1963.

<doc id="904411" wikidata="Q4934168" url="?curid=904411" title="Bob Tewksbury">
<text>Robert Alan Tewksbury (born November 30, 1960) is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher and current Mental Skills Coordinator for the Chicago Cubs. He played professionally for the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, Texas Rangers, San Diego Padres and the Minnesota Twins.

Bob Tewksbury has the second-lowest ratio of base on balls per innings pitched for any starting pitcher to pitch in the major leagues since the 1920s, and the lowest ratio for any pitcher to pitch since the 1800s except for Deacon Phillippe, Babe Adams, Dan Quisenberry, and Addie Joss.

==Early life==
Tewksbury was born in Concord, New Hampshire and attended Merrimack Valley High School in Penacook, New Hampshire. He played college baseball at Rutgers and Saint Leo University. In 1979 and 1980, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star in 1979.

==Playing career==

Tewksbury&#x27;s talent was initially discovered by Andy Michael in Concord. Michael contacted the New York Yankees and Tewksbury was drafted by them out of Saint Leo University in the 19th round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft. He earned a spot in the Yankees&#x27; rotation in 1986 after pitching 20 straight scoreless innings in spring training. In his major league debut on April 11, 1986, he allowed two runs in innings against the Milwaukee Brewers, was credited with the win in New York&#x27;s 3–2 victory, and received a standing ovation from the fans at Yankee Stadium. After the game, team owner George Steinbrenner sent him a bottle of champagne, which the pitcher never opened and kept as a souvenir. He played for the Yankees for two years, and was then sent to the Chicago Cubs. As a free agent in 1988, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals, where he would stay until 1994. Again a free agent, he went to the Texas Rangers for a year. In 1996, he signed with the San Diego Padres for one more year. In December 1996, he signed with the Minnesota Twins and played for two years with the team, but shoulder problems effectively ended his baseball career after that.

Due to the shoulder and arm problems he faced over the course of his playing career, Tewksbury became known as an excellent control pitcher. His best year was 1992, in which he went 16–5 on the season and had a 2.16 ERA in 233 innings pitched. He appeared in the All-Star game and was third in the Cy Young Award voting that year. His injury problems marred his success from that point forward, with his best post-Cardinals year being in San Diego, where he helped the Padres capture the NL West division title.

In 1992 Tewksbury walked only 20 batters in 233 innings, the best ratio in the major leagues in over half a century. The next season Tewksbury came very close to ending the season with more wins than bases on balls allowed, an elusive feat only accomplished 4 times by 3 different starting pitchers in MLB history. He had 17 wins with only 18 walks allowed late in the season but gave up a walk apiece in his last two starts and did not achieve a win in either game, ending the season with 17 wins on 20 walks. Tewksbury has the third-lowest career walks per 9 innings for any MLB pitcher that pitched after 1927 behind only Josh Tomlin who pitched in the 21st century and famed relief pitcher Dan Quisenberry.

Tewksbury was a better than average fielding pitcher in his major league career. He recorded a career .980 fielding percentage with only 10 errors in 492 total chances covering 1,807 innings pitched over 302 pitching appearances, which was 24 points higher than the league average at his position.

Tewksbury was primarily a starting pitcher (302 appearances, 277 as a starter) but on April 13, 1990, he picked up his one and only save. Tewksbury pitched the final 3 innings of a 11-0 Cardinals victory over the Phillies. He saved the game for starting pitcher John Tudor.

During and after his baseball career, he became well known for his philanthropy. He has done a lot of work for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, as well as hospital visits for sick children.

==Pitching style==
Tewksbury was a &quot;changeup artist,&quot; according to Rory Costello of the Society for American Baseball Research. Since his fastball was relatively slow, he relied on deception and strategic location of his pitches to win ballgames. He was not afraid of the ball getting hit, realizing that most balls put in play are outs. Tewksbury would also vary the speeds of his offerings to frustrate the batters&#x27; timing. In 1997, the ever-crafty Tewksbury threw an Eephus pitch, joining an elite few who have thrown the &quot;junkiest pitch in baseball.&quot; He threw it to power-hitter Mark McGwire in an interleague play game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and McGwire grounded out on the pitch – twice. Tewksbury&#x27;s son, Griffin, has been quoted as calling this pitch &quot;The Dominator.&quot;

==After retirement==
After retiring, Tewksbury worked as a player development consultant for the Boston Red Sox and appeared as a commentator for Red Sox coverage on the New England Sports Network He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in physical education at St. Leo University in 2000 and earned his master&#x27;s degree in psychology at Boston University in 2004.

Tewksbury has been a sports psychology coach since 2004. After earning a master&#x27;s degree in the subject from Boston University, he served as the sports psychologist for the Boston Red Sox and, later, the San Francisco Giants. He is an Adjunct Professor of Sport Psychology &amp; Exercise at NHTI, Concord&#x27;s Community College. Tewksbury still lives in New Hampshire, continuing his charitable work.

Tewksbury played himself in the movie &quot;The Scout&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Tewksbury was inducted into the Saint Leo Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2018, he became one of the inaugural members of the Merrimack Valley High School Hall of Fame.

<doc id="904426" wikidata="Q560098" url="?curid=904426" title="Samuel T. Cohen">
<text>Samuel Theodore Cohen (January 25, 1921 – November 28, 2010) was an American physicist who is generally credited as the father of the neutron bomb.

==Biography==
Cohen&#x27;s parents were Austrian Jews who emigrated from London, England. He was born on January 25, 1921, in Brooklyn and raised in New York City. He studied mathematics and physics at University of California, Los Angeles before joining the United States Army after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1944 he worked on the Manhattan Project in the efficiency group at Los Alamos and calculated how neutrons behaved in Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan. After the war he studied for his Ph.D. at Berkeley before dropping out to join the RAND Corporation. At RAND Corporation in 1950, his work on the intensity of fallout radiation first became public when his calculations were included as a special appendix in Samuel Glasstone&#x27;s book &quot;The Effects of Atomic Weapons&quot;. Cohen was personally responsible for recruiting the famous strategist Herman Kahn into the RAND Corporation.
During the Vietnam War, Cohen argued that using small neutron bombs would end the war quickly and save many American lives, but politicians were not amenable to his ideas and other scientists ignored the neutron bomb in reviewing the role of nuclear weapons. He was a member of the &quot;Los Alamos Tactical Nuclear Weapons Panel&quot; in the early 1970s. President Carter delayed development of the neutron bomb in 1978, but during Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Cohen claims to have convinced Reagan to make 700 neutron bombs, 350 shells to go into the 8 inch (200-millimeter) howitzer and 350 W70 Mod. 3 warheads for the Lance missile.

===&quot;Clean&quot; nuclear tests===
In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced the testing of a 95% &quot;clean&quot; (2-stage) fusion weapon, later identified to have been the July 11 &quot;Navajo&quot; test at Bikini Atoll during &quot;Operation Redwing&quot;. This weapon had a yield of 4.5 megatons. Previous &quot;dirty&quot; weapons had fission proportions of 50–77%, due to the use of uranium-238 as a &quot;pusher&quot; around the lithium deuteride (secondary) stage. This is deliberate; the fusion reactions give off large quantities of 14.1 MeV neutrons, which have more energy than the 1.1 MeV &quot;fission threshold&quot; for U-238. This means the neutrons, which would otherwise escape, create fission reactions in the neutron reflecting &#x27;tamper&#x27;, increasing the overall yield of the weapon essentially &quot;for free&quot;.

The 1956 &quot;clean&quot; tests used a lead pusher, while in 1958 a tungsten carbide pusher was employed. Hans A. Bethe supported clean nuclear weapons in 1958 as chairman of a presidential science advisory group on nuclear testing:
... certain hard targets require ground bursts, such as airfield runways if it is desired to make a crater, railroad yards if severe destruction of tracks is to be accomplished ... The use of clean weapons in strategic situations may be indicated in order to protect the local population.– Dr. Hans Bethe, Working Group Chairman, 27 March 1958 &quot;Top Secret – Restricted Data&quot; Report to the NSC Ad Hoc Working Group on the Technical Feasibility of a Cessation of Nuclear Testing, p 9.

In consequence of Bethe&#x27;s recommendations, on July 12, 1958, the &quot;Hardtack-Poplar&quot; shot of the Mk-41C warhead was carried out on a barge in the lagoon yielded 9.3 megatons, of which only 4.8% was fission, and thus 95.2% &quot;clean&quot;.

In 1958, Cohen investigated a low-yield &quot;clean&quot; nuclear weapon and discovered that the &quot;clean&quot; bomb case thickness scales as the cube root of yield. So a larger percentage of neutrons escapes from a small detonation, due to the thinner case required to reflect back X-rays during the secondary stage (fusion) ignition. For example, a 1-kiloton bomb only needs a case one-tenth the thickness of that required for 1-megaton.

So, although most neutrons are absorbed by the casing in a 1-megaton bomb, in a 1-kiloton bomb they would mostly escape. A neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10–15 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.

===U.S. Department of Defense manual on the neutron bomb===
Cohen&#x27;s neutron bomb is not mentioned in the unclassified manual by Glasstone and Dolan, &quot;The Effects of Nuclear Weapons&quot; 1957–1977, but is included as an &quot;enhanced neutron weapon&quot; in chapter 5 of the declassified (formerly secret) manual edited by Philip J. Dolan, &quot;Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons&quot;, U.S. Department of Defense, effects manual DNA-EM-1, updated 1981 (U.S. Freedom of Information Act).

Under most atmospheric conditions no fallout effects would occur from the use of a neutron bomb, according to that manual, as the combination of 500-meter burst altitude and low yield prevents fallout in addition to significant thermal and blast effects. The reduction in damage outside the target area is a major advantage of such a weapon to deter massed tank invasions. An aggressor would thus be forced to disperse tanks, which would make them easier to destroy by simple hand-held anti-tank missile launchers.

Cohen&#x27;s backing of investigations into these controversial ideas won him some media attention after many years of being ignored. In 1992 he was featured in the award-winning BBC TV series &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, episode &quot;To the Brink of Eternity&quot;, discussing his battles with officialdom and colleagues at the RAND Corporation. Cohen controversially argued: &quot;When we started this systems analysis business, we stepped through the looking glass where people did the weirdest things and (used) the most perverse kind of logic imaginable and yet claimed to have the most precise understanding of everything.&quot;

==Alleged support from the Pope for low-yield tactical nuclear bombs==
Cohen reportedly worked in France on low-yield, highly discriminate tactical nuclear weapons in 1979–80. He claimed that he was awarded a medal by Pope John Paul II in 1979 for his bid to reform modern warfare. Author Charles Platt reported in a 2005 profile of Sam Cohen that &quot;... he showed me the Medal of Peace that he had received from the Pope in 1979.&quot;

At the time, Warsaw Pact forces had a massive tank superiority in Europe (though NATO maintained an overall strategic superiority); the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported in 1981 that there were &quot;19,500 tanks in the Soviet-controlled forces of the Warsaw Pact aimed at Western Europe. Of these, 12,500 are Soviet tanks in Soviet units. NATO has 7,000 tanks on its side facing the 19,500.&quot; A deterrent which was designed to minimise civilian casualties was a step away from the risk of indiscriminate warfare. The neutron bomb&#x27;s killing by neutron radiation is different from the fallout of a normal high yield thermonuclear weapon because it can be controlled more precisely, restricted to military targets and kept away from civilians.

The speed of modern warfare meant that the civilian population would be unlikely to be able to withdraw from combat zones and would suffer a large number of deaths in a nuclear war where the blast yields and fallout were significant. Because neutron bombs do not produce the indiscriminate blast (only 40 kilopascals at ground zero from a 1 kt blast yield detonation at 500 m altitude, and only 7 kPa at 2 km distance), heat, and fallout damage of other nuclear weapons, they were more credible as a deterrent to Soviet tanks. However, many people believed that the very deployment of the neutron bomb threatened an escalation to full-scale nuclear retaliation, thus canceling out the supposed benefits. Advances in precision anti-tank weapons ultimately made the neutron bomb redundant tactically in its original objective. The debate over &quot;clean&quot; low yield nuclear weapons continues with earth penetrator technology (&quot;nuclear bunker busters&quot;).

===Red Mercury claims===
More recently, Cohen was the main proponent of what most consider to be a mythical substance, red mercury. If the &quot;conventional story&quot; is to be believed, red mercury was a disinformation campaign led by US government agencies in order to lure potential terrorists into being captured. The story that was released was that red mercury was developed by the Soviet Union as a &quot;shortcut&quot; to a fusion bomb, and that with the fall of the Soviet Union it was being offered on the market by the Soviet mafia. When prospective buyers showed up to take delivery of the material, they were arrested.

During the height of the story, in the 1990s, Cohen became a proponent of red mercury. He claimed not only that it existed, but that he knew its nature; it was a powerful ballotechnic material that directly compressed the fusion fuel without the need for a fission primary. Bombs using red mercury had no real critical mass and could be developed at any size. He further claimed that the Soviets had produced a number of &quot;micro-nukes&quot; based on red mercury, which are described as being about as large as a baseball and weighing 10 pounds. According to Cohen, their existence meant that any effort to control nuclear proliferation based on fissile material was thus hopeless. A reiteration of the claim can be seen in &quot;The Nuclear Threat That Doesn&#x27;t Exist – or Does It or No?&quot;, by Cohen and Joe Douglass in a March 11, 2003, guest editorial in &quot;Financial Sense Online&quot;.

===Political involvement===
In 1984, in a cover story for the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot;, Cohen expressed support for the construction of a nuclear-radiation field along the borders of Israel as a means of protecting it from the military forces of other nations and killing anyone who approached it via gamma radiation. &quot;What I am suggesting is the construction of a border barrier whose most effective component is an extremely intense field of nuclear radiation (produced by the operation of underground nuclear reactors), sharply confined to the barrier zone, which practically guarantees the death of anyone attempting to breach the barrier,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Establishing such a &#x27;nuclear wall&#x27; at the borders of a threatened country can make virtually impossible any successful penetration by ground forces – as well as a preemptive ground attack by the threatened country.&quot;

Cohen spoke at an April 2000 fundraiser in La Canada, California, for then-Reform Party presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan. Irv Rubin was prominently present at this event, with his organization, the Jewish Defense League (JDL), and with members of the Libertarian Party, to protest. The JDL posted Cohen&#x27;s home phone number and address on its website, urging its members to contact him, to persuade him to stop supporting Buchanan.

In her address to the 2000 Reform Party National Convention, Buchanan&#x27;s running mate, Ezola Foster, cited Cohen&#x27;s endorsement of Buchanan to refute the claim that the candidate was anti-Semitic.

==Support for Baptist pastor and author William P. Grady==
As part of a self-described unusual friendship, Cohen wrote the afterword to William P. Grady&#x27;s 2005 bestseller titled &quot;How Satan Turned America Against God&quot;. Cohen explained that although he was an unbelieving Jew, and thus could not relate to the spiritual content of the book, he concurred with Grady&#x27;s grasp of America&#x27;s disastrous foreign policy.

==Death==
He died on November 28, 2010, in Brentwood, Los Angeles, from complications of his stomach cancer.

==In popular culture==
On the DVD of the film &quot;Repo Man&quot; (which contains a fictional character loosely based on Cohen and the neutron bomb as a plot device), Cohen is interviewed in the commentary on the deleted scenes. During the interview, Cohen asserts that the neutron bomb conforms to just war theories.

The &quot;Neutron Bomb&quot; documentary film by Peter Kuran (released in 2022) was partly based on a prior interview with Cohen.

<doc id="904427" wikidata="Q961338" url="?curid=904427" title="John R. Cash (album)">
<text>John R. Cash is the 51st overall album by country singer Johnny Cash, released in 1975 on Columbia Records. It consists mostly of covers of other musicians&#x27; songs. The first track on the album, a song titled &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;, is not the state song of Kentucky, but a composition by Randy Newman which had been previously recorded by the Osborne Brothers in 1970 and Three Dog Night in 1972; Cash&#x27;s version, like that of the Osborne Brothers five years previous, was released as the second single from the album, though the previously issued single &quot;The Lady Came from Baltimore&quot; had achieved greater success on the charts, reaching #14. The Cash original &quot;Lonesome to the Bone&quot; had previously appeared on &quot;Ragged Old Flag&quot; (1974) and would make one more appearance on &quot;Silver&quot; (1979).

Cash himself disliked &quot;John R. Cash&quot;, criticizing both the album and its production process in his 1997 autobiography, &quot;&quot;. He said the release was &quot;[the CBS bosses&#x27;] idea of an album to restore [Cash&#x27;s] sales potential&quot;, mentioning that the instrumental tracks were recorded separately from the vocals, a standard practice Cash didn&#x27;t usually follow himself. In addition, this was the first Johnny Cash album on which his regular backing group, The Tennessee Three did not participate; instead, producer Gary Klein recruited a number of session musicians including members of Elvis Presley&#x27;s TCB Band concert backing group, including guitarist James Burton, pianist Larry Muhoberac and drummer Ron Tutt.

<text>The Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State was a transitional post established in January 1922, lasting until the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922.

The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 was passed by the Irish Republic&#x27;s Dáil Éireann. The British government also required it to be passed by the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, and for a legal government to be established. Michael Collins became Chairman of the Provisional Government (i.e. prime minister). He also remained Minister for Finance of Arthur Griffith&#x27;s republican administration.

After Collins and Griffith&#x27;s deaths in August 1922, W. T. Cosgrave became both Chairman of the Provisional Government and President of Dáil Éireann, and the distinction between the two became increasingly confused and irrelevant until the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922.

<text>Ageratina, commonly known as snakeroot, is a genus of over 300 species of perennials and rounded shrubs in the family Asteraceae.

These plants grow mainly in the warmer regions of the Americas and West Indies. Over 150 species are native to Mexico. Some flourish in the cooler areas of the eastern United States. Two Mexican species have become a pest in parts of Australia and Taiwan. &quot;Ageratina&quot; used to belong to the genus &quot;Eupatorium&quot;, but it has been reclassified.

The genus name &quot;Ageratina&quot; means &quot;like &quot;Ageratum&quot;&quot; and consists of &quot;Ageratum&quot; and &quot;-ina&quot;, the feminine form of the Latin adjectival suffix .

==Description==

The inflorescence consists of multiple fluffy, red or pinkish-white capitula in clusters. These lack the typical ray flowers of the composites.

They have multiple, much-branched woody stems. The petioles are rather long. The leaves are triangular, serrate and opposite with a foul-smelling, musky scent.

== Toxicity==

Milk from cows that have eaten snakeroot can cause illness if ingested because the milk becomes toxic. Symptoms of milk sickness include vomiting.

== Medicinal use ==
&quot;Ageratina pichinchensis&quot; is a traditional Mexican treatment for superficial fungal infections of the skin. These plant extracts contain encecalin which has activity to inhibit and kill the fungus. Studies have compared its effectiveness in treating toenail fungus with ciclopirox.

Long used in India to treat snakebite, epilepsy, mental disorders. It was also discovered to be useful in regulating hypertension discovered in 1949, but it causes various side effects. Used to treat schizophrenia due to the alkaloid reserpine it contains.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to human–computer interaction:

[[Human–computer interaction|Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)]] – the intersection of computer science and behavioral sciences — this field involves the study, planning, and design of the interaction between people (users) and computers. Attention to human-machine interaction is important, because poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example of this is the Three Mile Island accident where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partially responsible for the disaster.

== Definitions ==

Human–Computer Interaction can be described as all of the following:
* A field of science – systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
** An applied science – field that applies human knowledge to build or design useful things.
*** A field of computer science – scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications.
** An application of engineering – science, skill, and profession of acquiring and applying scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge, to design and also build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes.
*** An application of software engineering – application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.
**** A subfield of computer programming – process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages (such as Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP etc.). The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors.
** A social science – academic discipline concerned with society and human behavior.
*** A behavioral science – discipline that explores the activities of and interactions among organisms. It involves the systematic analysis and investigation of human and animal behavior through controlled and naturalistic observation, and disciplined scientific experimentation. Examples of behavioral sciences include psychology, psychobiology, and cognitive science.
* A type of system – set of interacting or interdependent components forming an integrated whole or a set of elements (often called &#x27;components&#x27; ) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** A system that includes software – software is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer. In other words, software is a set of programs, procedures, algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system.
* A type of technology – making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, methods of organization, to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species&#x27; ability to control and adapt to their natural environments.
** A form of computer technology – computers and their application.

<doc id="904450" wikidata="Q810441" url="?curid=904450" title="Basquiat (film)">
<text>Basquiat is a 1996 American biographical drama film directed, written and co-composed by Julian Schnabel in his feature directorial debut. The film is based on the life of American postmodernist/neo expressionist artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. It is the first film about an American painter written and directed by another painter.

Jeffrey Wright portrays Basquiat, a Brooklyn-born artist who used his graffiti roots as a foundation to create collage-style paintings on canvas. David Bowie plays Basquiat&#x27;s friend and mentor, pop artist Andy Warhol. Additional cast members include Gary Oldman as a character based on Schnabel, Michael Wincott as the poet and art critic Rene Ricard, Dennis Hopper as Bruno Bischofberger, Parker Posey as gallery owner Mary Boone, and Claire Forlani, Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, Courtney Love, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, and Benicio del Toro in supporting roles as &quot;composite characters&quot;.

== Plot ==

The film is a lightly fictionalized account of Basquiat&#x27;s life. A struggling artist living in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square Park works his way up the rungs of the New York art world in the eighties, thanks in part to his association with Andy Warhol, the art dealer Bruno Bischofberger, poet and critic René Ricard, and fellow artist Albert Milo.

Alongside the development of his artistic career, the film follows Basquiat&#x27;s tumultuous relationship with Gina, a fellow aspiring artist he meets while she is working as a waitress at the diner he frequents with his friend Benny. Their romance is affected by Basquiat&#x27;s affair with &quot;Big Pink&quot;, a woman he picks up on the street, and his heroin addiction. Eventually, Basquiat finds himself isolated by his fame, the death of Warhol, and his drug use. The film ends with an intertitle stating that Basquiat died of a heroin overdose on August 12, 1988, at the age of 27.

===Writing===
Julian Schnabel had given seed money to another film that was being developed about Jean-Michel Basquiat, but when he read an early script that he believed misrepresented Andy Warhol, he decided to make the film himself. Schnabel said, &quot;In the film, I wanted to make a requiem for Jean and Andy ... They were so attacked. Andy cared about Jean-Michel. He was really human. He wasn&#x27;t a vampire. His death broke Jean-Michel&#x27;s heart.&quot;

The film has a screenplay by Schnabel and a story by Lech Majewski.

===Schnabel&#x27;s art in film===
As director, Schnabel inserted himself into the film as the fictional character Albert Milo (Gary Oldman), based on himself. Schnabel also added cameo appearances by his mother, father, and daughter (as Milo&#x27;s family). Schnabel appeared as an extra as a waiter.

&quot;Basquiat&quot; was the first commercial feature film about a painter made by a painter. Schnabel said:

&quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to be attacked as an artist. I know what it&#x27;s like to be judged as an artist. I know what it&#x27;s like to arrive as an artist and have fame and notoriety. I know what it&#x27;s like to be accused of things that you never said or did. I know what it&#x27;s like to be described as a piece of hype. I know what it&#x27;s like to be appreciated as well as degraded.&quot;
Basquiat died in 1988 of mixed-drug toxicity (he had been combining cocaine and heroin, known as &quot;speedballing&quot;). Basquiat&#x27;s estate denied permission for his work to be used in the film. Schnabel and his studio assistant Greg Bogin created paintings &quot;in the style of&quot; Basquiat for the film.

===Casting===
After the film was released, Jeffrey Wright said that &quot;I think my performance was appropriated, literally, and the way I was edited was appropriated in the same way his [Basquiat&#x27;s] story has been appropriated and that he was appropriated when he was alive. [...] Julian made him out to be too docile and too much of a victim and too passive and not as dangerous as he really was. It&#x27;s about containing Basquiat. It&#x27;s about aggrandizing himself through Basquiat&#x27;s memory.&quot;

Comparing Bowie&#x27;s Warhol to earlier portrayals, Paul Morrissey (who directed many Warhol films) said &quot;Bowie was the best by far. You come away from &quot;Basquiat&quot; thinking Andy was comical and amusing, not a pretentious, phony piece of shit, which is how others show him.&quot; He also noted that &quot;Bowie at least knew Andy. They went to the same parties.&quot; Bowie was able to borrow Warhol&#x27;s actual wig, glasses and jacket from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh for the film. Writer Bob Colacello, who edited Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine in the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s, said &quot;[Crispin] Glover walked the most like [the real] Andy, [Jared] Harris talked the most like Andy, and Bowie looked the most like Andy. When I first saw Bowie on the set, it was like Andy had been resurrected.&quot;

In 2018, musician and actor Lenny Kravitz said in an interview with &quot;V Magazine&quot;, that Schnabel had asked him to take the role of Basquiat. Kravitz said, &quot;I look back and I&#x27;m like, wow, I probably should have done that&quot;.

Joseph Glasco, a friend of Schnabel&#x27;s, had a small acting role in the film and provided some voice over narration. He died May 31, 1996 before the film was released in August. Schnabel dedicated the film to Glasco in the final film credit.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Basquiat&quot; opened theatrically on August 9, 1996 in 6 venues, earning $83,863 in its first weekend. The film ultimately grossed $3,011,195 domestically.

===Critical reception===

The film received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 67% rating based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;With affected strokes, &quot;Basquiat&quot; paints an expressionist portrait of a misfit artist, masterfully rendered by a riveting Jeffrey Wright.&quot; Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars stating that in Schnabel&#x27;s portrayal of Basquiat &quot;is a quiet, almost wordless presence, a young man who rarely says what he is thinking and often deliberately chooses to miss the point of a conversation. He is dreamy, sweet, and pensive. There are deep hurts and angers&quot;. Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;bold, attention-getting and more than a little facile, a stylish-looking film without the connective tissue to give it real depth.&quot;

David Bonetti of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film a poor review due to his perception of the inexperience of the director, stating, &quot;Schnabel can&#x27;t decide whether he wants to tell a traditional rise-and-fall morality tale or make an art film. His attempt at telling Basquiat&#x27;s story straightforwardly collapses under its own banality&quot;. Similarly, the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Basquiat&quot; does not seem interested in anything that doesn&#x27;t advance its director&#x27;s personal agenda.&quot; The review stated that &quot;Though as a writer-director, Schnabel&#x27;s work is not the total fiasco the debut films of fellow artists David Salle (&quot;Search and Destroy&quot;) and Robert Longo (&quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;) were, it is fascinating to see what a compendium of Troubled Genius movie cliches he has turned out.&quot; Like several of the negative reviews, the review picked out for praise the acting of Jeffrey Wright as Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying &quot;&quot;Basquiat&#x27;s&quot; only genuine inspiration was casting Jeffrey Wright, who won a Tony for his work in &quot;Angels in America&quot; on the New York stage, as the artist. An actor whose talent is visible even in this standard role, Wright&#x27;s ability creates more interest in Basquiat&#x27;s fate than would otherwise exist.&quot;

The reviews in the art press focused more on the relation of Schnabel as director to his portrayal of Schnabel as artist in the film, and on changes to the facts of Basquiat&#x27;s life introduced by Schnabel to make a more accessible film. In &quot;Art in America&quot;, the art critic Brooks Adams wrote:

&quot;Basquiat&quot; can be seen as a huge, lurking self-portrait of the artist-Schnabel, not Basquiat. So laden is the film with the innumerable coincidences of Basquiat and Schnabel&#x27;s enthusiasms (among others, for pajamas and surfing) that the movie should be more appropriately called My Basquiat... To a remarkable degree, the movie succeeds, by dint of its authorial slant, in popularizing the myth of Basquiat as a young, gorgeous, doomed, yet ultimately transcendent black male artist, even as it extends and reinflates the myth of Schnabel as a protean, Picassoid white male painter... Yet for all one&#x27;s apprehension about the very idea of Schnabel making such a film, Basquiat turns out to be a surprisingly good movie...It is also an art work.

<doc id="904458" wikidata="Q231074" url="?curid=904458" title="Madeleine of Valois">
<text>Madeleine of Valois (10 August 1520 – 7 July 1537) was a French princess who briefly became Queen of Scotland in 1537 as the first wife of King James V. The marriage was arranged in accordance with the Treaty of Rouen, and they were married at Notre-Dame de Paris in January 1537, despite French reservations over her failing health. Madeleine died in July 1537, only six months after the wedding and less than two months after arriving in Scotland, resulting in her nickname, the &quot;Summer Queen&quot;.

== Early life ==

Madeleine was born at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, the fifth child and third daughter of King Francis I of France and Claude, Duchess of Brittany, herself the eldest daughter of King Louis XII of France and Anne, Duchess of Brittany.

She was frail from birth, and grew up in the warm and temperate Loire Valley region of France, rather than at Paris, as her father feared that the cold would destroy her delicate health. Together with her sister, Margaret, she was raised by her aunt, Marguerite de Navarre until her father remarried and his new wife, Eleanor of Austria, took them into her own household. By her sixteenth birthday, she had contracted tuberculosis.

== Marriage negotiations ==
Three years before Madeleine&#x27;s birth, the Franco-Scottish Treaty of Rouen was made to bolster the Auld Alliance after Scotland&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Flodden. A marriage between a French princess and the Scottish King was one of its provisions. In April 1530, John Stewart, Duke of Albany, was appointed commissioner to finalize the royal marriage between James V and Madeleine. However, as Madeleine did not enjoy good health, another French bride, Mary of Bourbon, was proposed.

James V sent his herald James Atkinhead to see Mary of Bourbon, and a contract was made for James to marry her. King James travelled to France in 1536 to meet Mary of Bourbon, but smitten with the delicate Madeleine, he asked Francis I for her hand in marriage. Fearing the harsh climate of Scotland would prove fatal to his daughter&#x27;s already failing health, Francis I initially refused to permit the marriage.

James V met Francis I and the French royal household between Roanne and Lyon on 13 October. He continued to press Francis I for Madeleine&#x27;s hand, and despite his reservations and nagging fears, Francis I reluctantly granted permission to the marriage only after Madeleine made her interest in marrying James very obvious. The court moved down the Loire Valley to Amboise, and to the Château de Blois, and the marriage contract was signed on 26 November 1536.

== Wedding at Notre-Dame ==

In preparation for the wedding, Francis I bought clothes and furnishings for Madeleine; jewels and gold chains were supplied by Regnault Danet, linen and cloths by Marie de Genevoise and Phillipe Savelon, clothes by the tailors Marceau Goursault and Charles Lacquait, veils by Jean Guesdon, and trimmings by Victor de Laval, who also made passementerie for a bed that Francis gave the couple. The goldsmith Thibault Hotman made silver plate for Madeleine. The merchants of the royal &quot;argenterie&quot;, René Tardif and Robert Fichepain supplied silks and woollen cloth. A quantity of gold and silver trimmings for embroidering the clothes of Madeleine and her ladies were ordered from Baptiste Dalverge, a wire-drawer. A platform walkway was constructed from the Bishop&#x27;s Palace to Notre-Dame de Paris.

After a Royal Entry into Paris on 31 December 1536, they were married at Notre-Dame on 1 January 1537. There was a banquet that night in the Great Hall of the Palais de la Cité. Over the next two weeks there were further celebrations and tournaments at the Château de la Tournelle and Louvre. The wedding festivities in 1537 were similar to those of 24 April 1558, for the wedding of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Francis, Dauphin of France.

Francis I provided Madeleine with a generous dowry of 100,000 écu, and a further 30,000 francs settled on James V. According to the marriage contract made at Blois, Madeleine renounced her and any of her heirs&#x27; claims to the French throne. If James died first, Madeleine would retain for her lifetime assets including the Earldoms of Fife, Strathearn, Ross, and Orkney with Falkland Palace, Stirling Castle, and Dingwall Castle, with the Lordship of Galloway and Threave Castle.

== Queen of Scots ==

In February the couple moved to Chantilly, to Senlis and Compiègne, where James received the Papal gift of hat and sword. They stayed two nights at the Château de La Roche-Guyon. After months of festivities and celebrations, the couple left France for Scotland from Le Havre in May 1537. The French ships were commanded by Jacques de Fountaines, Sieur de Mormoulins. On 15 May, English sailors sold fish to the Scottish and French fleet off Bamburgh Head. Madeleine&#x27;s health deteriorated even further, and she was very sick when the royal pair landed in Scotland. They arrived at Leith at 10 o&#x27;clock on Whitsun-eve, 19 May 1537.

According to John Lesley the ships were laden with her possessions;&quot;besides the Quenes Hienes furnitour, hinginis, and appareill, quhilk wes schippit at Newheavin and careit in Scotland, was also in hir awin cumpanye, transportit with hir majestie in Scotland, mony costlye jewells and goldin wark, precious stanis, orient pearle, maist excellent of any sort that was in Europe, and mony coistly abilyeaments for hir body, with mekill silver wark of coistlye cupbordis, cowpis, &amp; plaite.&quot;

A list or inventory of wedding presents from Francis I also survives, including Arras tapestry, cloths of estate, rich beds, two cupboards of silver gilt plate, table carpets, and Persian carpets. Francis I also gave James V three of the ships, the &quot;Salamander&quot;, &quot;Morsicher&quot;, and &quot;Great Unicorn&quot;. Madeleine took up residence at Holyrood Palace on 21 May 1537.

The French courtiers who came with her to Scotland to form her household included; her former governess, Anne de Boissy Gouffier, Madame de Montreuil; Anne de Viergnon, Madame de Bren or Bron; Anne Le Maye; Marguerite de Vergondois her chamberer; Marion Truffaut, her nurse; her secretary, Jean de Langeac, Bishop of Limoges; master household, Jean de St Aubin; squires and cupbearers Charles de Marconnay and Charles du Merlier; the physician Master Partix; pages John Crammy and Pierre de Ronsard; furrier Gillan; butcher John Kenneth; barber Anthony. A physician from Paris, Jacques Lecoq, set out later to join her in Scotland.

== Death ==
Madeleine wrote to her father from Edinburgh on 8 June 1537 saying that she was better and her symptoms had diminished. James V had written to Francis I asking him to send the physician Master Francisco, and Madeleine wrote that he was now needed only to perfect her cure. She signed this letter &quot;Magdalene de France&quot;. However, a month later, on 7 July 1537, (a month before her 17th birthday), Madeleine, the so-called &quot;Summer Queen&quot; of Scots, died in her husband&#x27;s arms at Holyrood Palace.

James V wrote to Francis I informing him of his daughter&#x27;s death. He called Madeleine &quot;my dear companion&quot; – &quot;votre fille, ma trés chére compaigne&quot;.

Queen Madeleine was interred in Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh, next to King James II of Scotland. Black mourning clothes were worn at her funeral, and an order was sent to the merchants of Dundee to provide black cloth. Her household servants were provided with &quot;dule gowns&quot;, and horses at the procession had black cloths and trappings. The chapel at Holyrood Palace was draped with cloth from Milan. The grave was desecrated by a mob in 1776 and her allegedly still beautiful head was stolen.

One of her gentlewomen, Madame de Montrueil or Motrell, visited London on her way back to France. She said that Madeleine &quot;had no good days after her arrival there (in Scotland), but always sickly with a catarrh which descended into her stomach, which was the cause of her death&quot;.

An inventory made of the king&#x27;s goods in 1542 includes some of her clothes, furnishings for her chapel, six stools for her gentlewomen to sit upon, and gold cups and other items made for her when she was a child.

==Commemoration==
Madeleine&#x27;s marriage and death were commemorated by the poet David Lyndsay&#x27;s &quot;Deploration of Deith of Quene Magdalene&quot;; the poem describes the pageantry of the marriage in France and Scotland:O Paris! Of all citeis principall!&lt;br&gt;Quhilk did resave our prince with laud and glorie,&lt;br&gt;Solempnitlie, throw arkis triumphall. [arkis = arches]&lt;br&gt;* * * * * *&lt;br&gt;Thou mycht have sene the preparatioun&lt;br&gt;Maid be the Thre Estaitis of Scotland&lt;br&gt;In everilk ciete, castell, toure, and town&lt;br&gt;* * * * * *&lt;br&gt;Thow saw makand rycht costlie scaffalding&lt;br&gt;Depaynted weill with gold and asure fyne&lt;br&gt;* * * * * *&lt;br&gt;Disagysit folkis, lyke creaturis devyne,&lt;br&gt;On ilk scaffold to play ane syndrie storie&lt;br&gt;Bot all in greiting turnit thow that glorie. [greiting = crying: thow = death]

Epitaphs in Latin were composed by the French writers Etienne Dolet, Nicolas Desfrenes, Jean Visagier, and an anonymous poet. Gilles Corrozet and Pierre de Ronsard wrote verses in French.

Less than a year after her death, following negotiations completed by David Beaton, James V married the widowed Mary of Guise. She had attended his wedding to Madeleine, and perhaps her uncle, Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine, suggested her to Francis I as a bride for the Scottish king. Twenty years later, listed amongst the treasures in Edinburgh Castle were two little gold cups, an agate basin, a jasper vase, and crystal jug given to Madeleine when she was a child in France.

<doc id="904466" wikidata="Q677458" url="?curid=904466" title="Lungi">
<text>The lungi is a clothing similar to the sarong that originated in the Indian subcontinent. The lungi, which usually multicoloured, is a men&#x27;s skirt usually tied around the lower waist below the navel. It can be worn as casual wear and night wear. It is favoured in hot and humid climates where the airflow it allows makes it more comfortable than alternatives.

==Design==
They are especially worn in hot regions. There are also cheaper &quot;open&quot; lungis, in identical dimensions but not sewn into a tube shape. The standard adult lungi is in height and in length, when open. Children&#x27;s lungis are approximately two-thirds of this size. They are normally woven from cotton and come in a variety of designs and colors. Silk lungis are used for ceremonial purposes such as weddings. The most common styles are solid-colored and plaid, reflecting the relative ease and cost-effectiveness of producing these patterns on a power loom. Blue is particularly popular, since it fades to pleasant tones in contrast to other colors. Regardless of the design or color, lungis are often lined at the top and bottom with a black/white stripe containing reinforced weaving to prevent fraying.

==Usage==
Depending on local tradition, lungis can be worn by men or, more rarely, women. They are tied or fastened in various ways and can be used in different cultural activities, ranging from normal daily life to elaborate wedding ceremonies. For daily purposes, a simple &quot;double twist&quot; knot is most popular, where two points in the upper edge of lungi are brought together and twisted around twice, with the ends tucked in at the waist. However, it is also common for wearers to simply tie a double &quot;pretzel knot&quot; from 2 points on the upper border, which produces a more secure knot. The lungi&#x27;s length can also be adjusted, for example, by tucking in the lungi at the waist to make it resemble a short skirt. This is mostly used for labourers who have to work for a long time under a hot sun.

==Regional variations==
=== Bangladesh ===

The lungi (), is the most commonly seen dress of Bangladeshi men, although it is not normally worn for formal occasions. In Bangladesh, lungis are worn by men, almost universally indoors, but commonly outdoors as well. Elaborately designed tartan cotton, batik, or silk lungis are often presented as wedding gifts to the groom in a Bangladeshi wedding. The typical Bangladeshi lungi is a seamless tubular shape, as opposed to the single sheet worn in other parts of South and Southeast Asia. In Bangladesh, the lungi industry is concentrated in Sirajganj, Kushtia, Pabna, and Khulna. Bangladeshi women do not wear lungis, although non-Bengali tribal women do wear similar garments in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The lungi tradition of Bangladesh can be traced back to Bengal Sultanate when Men used to wear lungis or sarongs of cotton fabrics of various colors along with turbans, dhutis, leather shoes, and belts to wrap their robes on the waist. The word Lungi is a Burmese influenced word in the Bengali vocabulary, came from the word &quot;Longyi&quot;. Lungi is also believed to be a variation of Dhoti, the word Dhoti came from the Bengali word &quot;Dhowa&quot; which means &quot;Wash&quot;.

In April 2013, the Baridhara Housing Society—a housing society in Dhaka—banned the lungi and began refusing entry to those who wore them. Many opposed the ban, however, taking to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to criticize the decision. A march took place on 13 April to oppose the ban. U.S Ambassador Dan Mozena has been seen wearing a lungi in front of his house.

In India, the customs of wearing lungis vary by state. It can be worn with or without the traditional unsewn kaupinam or modern sewn langot, both of which are types of traditional loincloth undergarments.

In Kerala, the lungi is generally colourful and available in various designs, and is worn by both men and women. It is also called &#x27;kaili (കൈലി)&#x27;. Labourers typically wear it while working. A mundu/dhoti is a variation of the lungi and is mostly plain white. It often bears golden embroidery (kasavu), especially at the border. It is worn as formal attire and on ceremonial occasions like weddings, festivals, etc. Saffron-coloured lungis are known as &quot;kaavi mundu&quot;. Men sometimes tuck up their &quot;mundus&quot; or lungis with the bottom of the garment being pulled up and tied back on to the waist. In this case, the mundu or lungi only covers the body from the waist to the knees.

In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, only men wear this garment. It is also known as &quot;kaili&quot; or &quot;sāram&quot;/&quot;chāram&quot; in South Tamil Nadu.

In Punjab, lungis are worn by both men and women. The male lungi is also called a , while the female lungi is called a . They are part of traditional dance attire in Bhangra dance groups, but are also popular in rural areas as home wear. They are generally tied in a different way than in other parts of India and are, as a rule, unstitched and very colourful. Wearing the lungi has declined in the Punjab region in recent years.
In Odisha and West Bengal, the lungi is primarily worn at home by men of all societal classes. Hindu men generally avoid wearing lungis on the street. In Odisha, Sambalpuri with the Sambalpuri pattern and mule based lungis from Khordha are available in addition to normal cotton fabric lungis.

In Bihar and Haryana, the lungi is considered a night garment for men. They are not worn outside the homes

In Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh the lungi is often worn by tribal people. Previously, they used to wear a small cloth around their waist.

=== Maldives ===

===Myanmar===

In Myanmar, it is spelt longyi. For men, the longyi is known as a &quot;paso&quot; (Burmese: ပုဆိုး), and for women, it is known as a &quot;htamein&quot; (Burmese: ထဘီ). Longyis of different fabrics, including cotton and silk, are worn for both informal and formal occasions.

<text>The Tennessee Senate is the upper house of the U.S. state of Tennessee&#x27;s state legislature, which is known formally as the Tennessee General Assembly.

The Tennessee Senate has the power to pass resolutions concerning essentially any issue regarding the state, country, or world. The Senate also has the power to create and enforce its own rules and qualifications for its members. The Senate shares these powers with the Tennessee House of Representatives. The Senate alone has the power to host impeachment proceeding and remove impeached members of office with a 2/3 majority. The Tennessee Senate, according to the state constitution of 1870, is composed of 33 members, one-third the size of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Senators are to be elected from districts of substantially equal population. According to the Tennessee constitution, a county is not to be joined to a portion of another county for purposes of creating a district; this provision has been overridden by the rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (369 U.S. 182, 1962) and &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (337 U.S. 356, 1964). The Tennessee constitution has been amended to allow that if these rulings are ever changed or reversed, a referendum may be held to allow the senate districts to be drawn on a basis other than substantially equal population.

Until 1966, Tennessee state senators served two-year terms. That year the system was changed, by constitutional amendment, to allow four-year terms. In that year, senators in even-numbered districts were elected to two-year terms and those in odd-numbered districts were elected to four-year terms. This created a staggered system in which only half of the senate is up for election at any one time. Senators from even-numbered districts are elected in the same years as presidential elections, and senators from odd-numbered districts are elected in the same years as mid-term elections. Districts are to be sequentially and consecutively numbered; the scheme basically runs from east to west and north to south.

Republicans attained an elected majority in the Senate in the 104th General Assembly (2005–07) for the first time since Reconstruction; a brief majority in the 1990s was the result of two outgoing senators switching parties. Following the 2018 elections, there were no Democratic senators from East Tennessee. There were three Democrats from Memphis in West Tennessee, and three from Middle Tennessee, two from Nashville and one from the Nashville suburb of Goodlettsville.

==Speaker of the Senate==
According to Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, the speaker of the Senate assumes the office of governor in the event of a vacancy. The Senate elects one of its own members as speaker and the speaker automatically becomes the lieutenant governor. The speaker appoints a speaker pro tempore who presides over the Senate in the absence of the speaker as well as a deputy speaker to assist the speaker in his or her duties. The current speaker of the Senate and lieutenant governor is Randy McNally, who was elected to the position in 2017. One of the main duties of the speaker is to preside over the Senate and make Senate committee appointments based upon ability and preference of members, seniority, and party representation. The speaker also maintains the power to remove members from Committee appointments. The speaker, in cohort with the speaker of the House of Representatives, chairs the Joint Legislative Services Committee which provides assistance to the General Assembly. The speaker also controls staffing and office space with Senate staff. The speaker serves as an ex-officio member of all standing committees.

== Oath and qualifications of office ==
=== Oath of office ===
&quot;I [name of official] do solemnly swear that, as a member of this, the [number, ex. One Hundred Eleventh] General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, I will faithfully support the Constitution of this State and of the United States, and I do solemnly affirm that as a member of this General Assembly, I will, in all appointments, vote without favor, affection, partiality, or prejudice; and that I will not propose or assent to any bill, vote or resolution, which shall appear to me injurious to the people, or consent to any act or thing, whatever, that shall have a tendency to lessen or abridge their rights and privileges, as declared by the Constitution of this state.&quot;

=== Qualifications for office ===
&quot;No person shall be a senator unless he shall be a citizen of the United States, of the age of thirty years, and shall have resided three years in this state, and one year in the county or district, immediately preceding the election.&quot;

<doc id="904472" wikidata="Q3222444" url="?curid=904472" title="Bart-Mangled Banner">
<text>&quot;Bart-Mangled Banner&quot; is the twenty-first and penultimate episode of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 16, 2004. The episode was written by John Frink and directed by Steven Dean Moore.

In this episode, Bart accidentally disrespects the American flag, and the situation escalates until the United States hates Springfield and the Simpson family is arrested. The episode received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
Homer and Marge take the kids to get their shots. Just before Dr. Hibbert is about to inject Bart, he escapes. After a chase through town, Hibbert finally outsmarts Bart, by having Barney (as well as Moe) wear a latex mask, and finally injects him. However, the shot causes Bart&#x27;s earholes to swell shut as a side effect, making him temporarily deaf and Hibbert also tricks Homer into signing a malpractice waiver. Marge wants Bart to stay home from school; however, Bart wants to play in the donkey basketball game.

While at the Springfield Elementary School donkey basketball game, Bart taunts a donkey with a carrot, unaware that the school is reciting the national anthem. After he places the carrot in his shorts, the donkey takes it and literally eats Bart&#x27;s shorts. While Bart is bent over to keep his privates covered with his shirt, the US flag is put up behind him and a photo is taken, which results in the crowd assuming that Bart is mooning the US flag. Shortly afterwards, the &quot;Springfield Shopper&quot; takes the story and completely turns it around, making it seem as if Bart had deliberately mooned the flag. Marge tries to convince Skinner that Bart was deaf at the time; however, because of Bart&#x27;s history of similar pranks, Skinner is not convinced. Bart and his family soon are hated by all of Springfield.

The Simpsons are later asked to appear on a talk show and tell their side of the story. Homer advises Marge to not take it too far. However, due to the several misunderstandings, the host declares that Springfield hates the US. The US then turns their back on Springfield (though there is widespread celebration in praise of Springfield in the Middle East), so Mayor Quimby frantically decides to change the name of Springfield to &quot;Libertyville.&quot; Everything in town is quickly patriotized; the traffic light colors are changed to red, white, and blue, everything costs $17.76., Apu starts selling Homeland Noodles with Uncle Sam Balls and changes his octuplets&#x27; names to &quot;Lincoln&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Condoleezza&quot;, &quot;Coke&quot;, &quot;Pepsi&quot;, &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, &quot;Apple Pie&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;, claiming their previous names to be &quot;pre-witchhunt&quot;, and the family&#x27;s last name to McGillicuddy. While at church, Lisa speaks her opinion about patriotism, and the Simpsons are arrested by SWAT, in violation of the &quot;Government Knows Best Act.&quot;

The Simpsons are taken to the &quot;Ronald Reagan Re-education Center&quot;, a prison which houses Michael Moore, the Dixie Chicks, Elmo, Al Franken, and Bill Clinton, as well as a man who moans &quot;My only crime was driving a van full of explosives in from Canada!&quot;. Marge feels bad that she took it too far after Homer warned her not to. With some help from the last-registered Democrat, the Simpsons escape the prison (in a parody of the escape scene from The Blues Brothers), but realize that the re-education center is actually Alcatraz Prison. While they are swimming to land (choosing to swim to Oakland instead of San Francisco because they &quot;aren&#x27;t made of money&quot;), they are picked up by a French freighter and are brought to France. They are well adjusted, but still miss the United States, mainly because it is where all their stuff is. They then move back to the US dressed as 19th century immigrants from Europe where Homer speaks of plans of integration into the United States.

==Cultural references==
At church, Lisa talks about the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, part of the United States Bill of Rights. After the family is arrested, they are made to watch a cartoon that describes the Bill of Rights as the Constitution&#x27;s &quot;crazy drunken cousin&quot;.

The cable debate show &quot;Headbutt&quot; that the Simpsons appear on is a reference to the CNN debate show &quot;Crossfire&quot; with Nash Castor being a parody of then-current host Tucker Carlson.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode earned a 3.2 rating and was watched by 8.69 million viewers, the 46th most-watched show that week.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; thought the episode may have had more impact at the time it aired, but thought the episode was &quot;heavy-handed and shrill&quot; eight years later. He liked the episode until it started the social commentary.

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Brendan Dando thought the episode had &quot;no direction&quot; where the events spiral out of control while Guy Davis thought the episode reflected the time after the September 11 attacks where comedians thought they needed to comment on the aftermath.

===Themes and analysis===
The episode was seen to be a reaction to the Dixie Chicks&#x27; remarks about George W. Bush in 2003 that were perceived to be unpatriotic. Matthew A. Henry writes that the episode was a satire of the incident with the Dixie Chicks that escalated to national news and their music being banned from radio stations. In this episode, a incident of Bart disrespecting the American flag leads to the Simpsons family being hated and Marge shocking the country by saying she hates Americans.

<text>Kinlochbervie (, ) is a scattered harbour village in the north west of Sutherland, in the Highland region of Scotland. It is the most northerly port on the west coast of Scotland.

==Geography==
Sandwood Bay, a scenic beach, is about a drive or a walk north of Kinlochbervie. Other scenic areas close to the village include Oldshoremore Beach and Rhiconich.

==Fishing==
The majority of local industry is based upon fishing. Although the fleet of ships actually based in Kinlochbervie is rather small, many ships from the east coast of Scotland land their catches in Kinlochbervie. The dominant feature of the town is the large fish handling depot. From here catches are loaded onto large refrigerated lorries for transport by road throughout Europe. The importance of this link to the outside world to the local economy means that Kinlochbervie has surprisingly good road links, given its remote location and rugged local geography.

==Tourism==
The local scenery is a tourist attraction and is also an important part of the local economy. There are many holiday homes and small bed and breakfast businesses in the area. The largest in the village is Kinlochbervie Hotel.

==Sports==
The village also has a rather successful amateur football team, which competes in the local amateur league along with Durness, Tongue, Bettyhill, Lochinver and Melvich. In 2005 they won the league trophy, the prestigious Stafford Cup, for the first time in many years. The team also won The Guy Cup in the same year by winning a tournament of local teams. This was the first time a team west of the Kyle of Tongue had won it.

The sport of shinty has recently been resurrected in Kinlochbervie by the local school, shinty was once played across North Sutherland until the 20th century but never competitively. Kinlochbervie Camanachd Club now compete at junior level against teams from across the Highlands.

==Cultural references==
The village features prominently in Irish writer Brian Friel&#x27;s play &quot;Faith Healer.&quot; Sailor Frank Dye started his journey to Iceland in a small Wayfarer dinghy from the village in 1963.

==&quot;Time Team&quot; ==
Divers from &quot;Time Team&quot; explored the waters off the coast of Kinlochbervie, about below the sea&#x27;s surface after a shipwreck and artefacts were discovered by divers from RAF Lossiemouth. The artefacts found included two anchors, five iron cannons and Spanish pottery from the 16th century. The site was designated as a Historic Maritime Protected Area in 2013. The episode was first broadcast on Sunday 20 January 2002.

<doc id="904489" wikidata="Q489816" url="?curid=904489" title="Valdiguié">
<text>Valdiguié is a red wine grape grown primarily in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France, where it is generally known by the alias Gros Auxerrois. In California it has been known as Napa Gamay or Gamay 15. Until 1980 Napa Gamay was believed to be the Gamay of Beaujolais, but following genetic analysis the name &quot;Napa Gamay&quot; has been banned from U.S. wine labels since June 23, 1997. Confusingly, both the Pinot noir clone Gamay Beaujolais and Valdiguié were sometimes also labelled as &quot;Gamay Beaujolais&quot; until that name was banned on labels in April 2007.

Other synonyms include Valdiguer, Cahors, Jean-Pierrou at Sauzet, Quercy and Noir de Chartres.

==Description==

Valdiguié was first commercially propagated in 1874, although its origin is unclear. There are three main theories :

* M. Valdiguié (1745-1817) selected a seedling from the Merille variety
* Guillaume Valdiguié found it in the vineyard of a Templar monastery in Aujols
* Jean Baptiste Valdiguié found it in a vineyard in Puylaroque and sold it from 1874

It produces medium to large conical clusters of dark blue-black fruit. It is a high yielding vine that is fairly resistant to oidium (powdery mildew).

==Cultivation and winemaking==
Valdiguié produces dark colored wines that are low in alcohol. The wines tend to be of light to medium body and are frequently made in a style similar to the true Gamay of Beaujolais.

<doc id="904490" wikidata="Q7261159" url="?curid=904490" title="Pure submodule">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the field of module theory, the concept of pure submodule provides a generalization of direct summand, a type of particularly well-behaved piece of a module. Pure modules are complementary to flat modules and generalize Prüfer&#x27;s notion of pure subgroups. While flat modules are those modules which leave short exact sequences exact after tensoring, a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence (known as a pure exact sequence) that remains exact after tensoring with any module. Similarly a flat module is a direct limit of projective modules, and a pure exact sequence is a direct limit of split exact sequences.

==Definition==

Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring (associative, with 1), let &quot;M&quot; be a (left) module over &quot;R&quot;, let &quot;P&quot; be a submodule of &quot;M&quot; and let &quot;i&quot;: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;M&quot; be the natural injective map. Then &quot;P&quot; is a pure submodule of &quot;M&quot; if, for any (right) &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;X&quot;, the natural induced map id&quot;X&quot; ⊗ &quot;i&quot; : &quot;X&quot; ⊗ &quot;P&quot; → &quot;X&quot; ⊗ &quot;M&quot; (where the tensor products are taken over &quot;R&quot;) is injective.

Analogously, a short exact sequence
:formula_1
of (left) &quot;R&quot;-modules is pure exact if the sequence stays exact when tensored with any (right) &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;X&quot;. This is equivalent to saying that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is a pure submodule of &quot;B&quot;.

==Equivalent characterizations==
Purity of a submodule can also be expressed element-wise; it is really a statement about the solvability of certain systems of linear equations. Specifically, &quot;P&quot; is pure in &quot;M&quot; if and only if the following condition holds: for any &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix (&quot;a&quot;&quot;ij&quot;) with entries in &quot;R&quot;, and any set &quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;m&quot; of elements of &quot;P&quot;, if there exist elements &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; in &quot;M&quot; such that
:formula_2
then there also exist elements &quot;x&quot;1′, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;′ in &quot;P&quot; such that
:formula_3
Another characterization is: a sequence is pure exact if and only if it is the filtered colimit (also known as direct limit) of split exact sequences

:formula_4

==Examples==

* Every direct summand of &quot;M&quot; is pure in &quot;M&quot;. Consequently, every subspace of a vector space over a field is pure.

==Properties==
Suppose
:formula_1
is a short exact sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules, then: 
# &quot;C&quot; is a flat module if and only if the exact sequence is pure exact for every &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. From this we can deduce that over a von Neumann regular ring, &quot;every&quot; submodule of &quot;every&quot; &quot;R&quot;-module is pure. This is because &quot;every&quot; module over a von Neumann regular ring is flat. The converse is also true.
# Suppose &quot;B&quot; is flat. Then the sequence is pure exact if and only if &quot;C&quot; is flat. From this one can deduce that pure submodules of flat modules are flat.
# Suppose &quot;C&quot; is flat. Then &quot;B&quot; is flat if and only if &quot;A&quot; is flat.
If formula_1 is pure-exact, and &quot;F&quot; is a finitely presented &quot;R&quot;-module, then every homomorphism from &quot;F&quot; to &quot;C&quot; can be lifted to &quot;B&quot;, i.e. to every &quot;u&quot; : &quot;F&quot; → &quot;C&quot; there exists &quot;v&quot; : &quot;F&quot; → &quot;B&quot; such that &quot;gv&quot;=&quot;u&quot;.

<text>Acid techno, sometimes known generally as &quot;[[acid (electronic music)|acid]]&quot;, is a genre of techno that was derived from acid house and developed in Europe in the late 1980s to early 1990s. It saw younger artists apply the &quot;squelching&quot; synthesizer sound of Chicago acid house to harder-edged techno material.

==Characteristics==
The acid style was obtained largely through Roland instruments, most prominently the TB-303 bass synthesizer. The term &quot;Acid&quot; specifically refers to the harsh &quot;acidic&quot; squelching sound of the Roland 303. The acid sound is achieved by turning up the filter resonance and turning down the cutoff frequency parameters of the synthesizer, along with programming the 303&#x27;s accent, slide, and octave parameters.

In addition to acid records imported from the US, the style was influenced by sources such as hardcore, German trance, and Belgian rave music.

==History==
Early exponents of the style included Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman), Aphex Twin, Dave Clarke, Hardfloor, solarquest, and Damon Wilde. Other mainstays included London acts such as Liberators, Henry Cullen (aka D.A.V.E. The Drummer), Guy McAffer (aka The Geezer), and DDR. In London, the acid techno scene developed via illegal network of parties; the 1997 compilation &quot;It&#x27;s Not Intelligent…And It&#x27;s Not From Detroit…But It&#x27;s F**king &#x27;Avin It&quot; was subtitled &quot;The Sound of London&#x27;s Acid Techno Underground&quot; and helped to solidify the genre in the underground consciousness. In recent years, Acid Techno had a comeback with artists of the younger generation such as Regal or Boston 168 releasing critically acclaimed Acid music and bringing the sound to big stages.

<text>The Tennessee General Assembly (TNGA) is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is a part-time bicameral legislature consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Speaker of the Senate carries the additional title and office of Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee. In addition to passing a budget for state government plus other legislation, the General Assembly appoints three state officers specified by the state constitution. It is also the initiating body in any process to amend the state&#x27;s constitution.

==Organization==

===Constitutional structure===
According to the Tennessee State Constitution of 1870, the General Assembly is a bicameral legislature and consists of a Senate of thirty-three members and a House of Representatives of ninety-nine members.

The representatives are elected to two-year terms; according to a 1966 constitutional amendment the senators are elected to four-year terms which are staggered, with the districts with even numbers being elected in the year of Presidential elections and those in the districts with odd numbers being elected in the years of Tennessee gubernatorial elections.

According to the Tennessee Constitution each representative must be twenty-one years old, a citizen of the United States, have been a resident of the state for three years and also a resident of the county they represent a year prior to the election. The state constitution also states that each senator must be thirty years of age, a citizen of the United States, resided three years in Tennessee, and resided in the district one year prior to the election.

===Part-time legislature===
To keep the legislature a part-time body, it is limited to ninety &quot;legislative days&quot; per two-year term, plus up to fifteen days for organizational purposes at the start of each term. A legislative day is considered any day that the House or Senate formally meets in the chambers of each house. Legislators are paid a base salary of $24,316 along with a per diem expense of $284 per legislative day (2020). If the legislature remains in session longer than ninety legislative days, lawmakers cease to draw their expense money.

Legislators also receive an &quot;office allowance&quot; of $1,000 per month, ostensibly for the maintenance of an office area devoted to their legislative work in their homes or elsewhere within their district. Traditionally, it has been easier, politically speaking, to raise the per diem and office allowance than the salary.

The speaker of each house is entitled to a salary triple that of other members. Under a law enacted in 2004, legislators will receive a raise equal to that given to state employees the previous year, if any.

The governor may also call &quot;extraordinary sessions&quot;, limited to the topic or topics outlined in the call, and limited to another twenty days. Two-thirds of each house may also initiate such a call by petitioning for it.

=== Joint Committees ===
Each chamber sets up its own committee system; however, there are a number of committees which are composed of members of both the House and Senate.

Joint Fiscal Review Committee

The Joint Fiscal Review Committee continuously reviews items such as revenue collections, the proposed budget and other budget requests, appropriations, state debt, and various state funds, among other items. It also prepares estimates of revenues from the Tennessee Education Lottery and oversees the financial operations of state departments and agencies. Further, it prepares the fiscal note attached to each bill presented in the General Assembly, describing the estimated cost of the bill&#x27;s contents on state and local government.

It was set up as a special continuing committee of the General Assembly in 1967 and is composed of six senators and nine representatives, each elected by their respective chambers. Additionally, &quot;ex officio&quot; members include the Speaker of each house and each house&#x27;s chairman of the Finance, Ways, and Means committee. The current members are as follows:

Joint Government Operations Rule Review Committee

The Joint Government Operations Rule Review Committee is composed of all members of the House and Senate Government Operations Committees. It reviews rules and regulations created by state departments and agencies.

It has three subcommittees.

Joint Committee on Pensions and Insurance

It is composed of the officers of the House and Senate Finance, Ways, and Means committees, three members appointed by each finance committee chair, and two members appointed by each speaker. Furthermore, the Comptroller of the Treasury, state treasurer, and commissioners of Human Resources and Finance and Administration, as well as the director of the state retirement system, are included on an &quot;ex-officio&quot; basis.

TACIR

The Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is considered to be a joint committee of the legislature.

==Work of the General Assembly==

===Legislative schedule===
Legislative days are scheduled no more than three days a week during the session. Legislative sessions in both the House and Senate occur on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Tuesdays and the majority of Wednesdays are used primarily for committee meetings and hearings rather than actual sessions. Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the Tennessee Capitol also take on an eclectic flavor most weeks, as varied and diverse constituent groups set up display booths to inform lawmakers about their respective causes.

Sessions begin each year in January and usually end by May; during recent fiscal crises meetings have spilled over into July. The time limit on reimbursed working days and the fact that the Tennessee state government fiscal year is on a July 1 – June 30 basis puts considerable time pressure on the General Assembly, especially with regard to the adoption of a budget.

Membership in the legislature is best regarded as being a full-time job during the session and a part-time job the rest of the year due to committee meetings and hearings (for which legislators are reimbursed their expenses and receive a mileage allowance). A few members are on enough committees to make something of a living from being legislators; most are independent businesspeople and attorneys, although the latter group is perhaps no longer the absolute majority of members that it at one time comprised. In keeping with Tennessee&#x27;s agricultural roots, some senators and representatives are farmers.

Lobbyists are not allowed to share meals with legislators on an individual basis, but they are not forbidden from inviting the entire legislature or selected groups to events honoring them, which has become a primary means of lobbying. Members are also forbidden from holding campaign fundraising events for themselves during the time they are actually in session.

===Leadership===
Each house sets its own rules and elects its own speaker; the Speaker of the Senate carries the additional title and office of Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee. For over three decades, both speakers were from West Tennessee; this caused considerable resentment in the eastern two-thirds of the state. From 1971 until January 2007, Tennessee had the same lieutenant governor, John S. Wilder, a Democrat. Wilder was re-elected to the position even after Tennessee Republicans re-took the state senate in the 2004 election. However, in January 2007, after Republicans gained additional seats in the 2006 General Assembly elections, the Senate elected Republican Ron Ramsey (from East Tennessee) to the office of lieutenant governor. The current lieutenant governor is Republican Randy McNally, who was elected in January 2017. The 111th General Assembly of Tennessee has 32 new legislators, with 28 of those legislators in the House. The 111th General Assembly also had a new Speaker of the House and majority leader in the Senate, respectively, and new lawmakers in leadership positions. The current speaker of the House is Cameron Sexton who was elected in 2019.

=== Layout of districts ===
The General Assembly districts of both houses are supposed to be reapportioned based on population as determined by the U.S. federal census on a decennial basis. This was not done between 1902 and 1962, resulting in the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (369 U.S. 186), which required this action to be taken. Afterwards, there were other lawsuits, including one which resulted in an order for the body to create a black-majority district in West Tennessee for the House in the late 1990s.

==Powers==

===Legislation===
Tennessee legislators&#x27; objectives are to enact, amend, and repeal Tennessee Laws. Powers specific to Tennessee legislators include appropriation of money, the levy and collection of taxes, and the right to authorize counties and towns to tax. The General Assembly is recognized by the state constitution as the supreme legislative authority of the state. It is the General Assembly&#x27;s responsibility to pass a budget for the functioning of the state government. Each year, the governor outlines their budget priorities in the State of the State address. The Assembly, in a joint session, is present for the speech. Bills may originate in either the House or Senate, and can be either a general or local bill. A general bill affects the state, while a local bill affects a town or county. A local bill must be passed in the state legislature and ratified by the local area it affects. The Tennessee Constitution states that after a bill has been rejected by the General Assembly, no bill with the same substance can be passed into law during the same session. The Tennessee Constitution states that each bill must be passed on three separate days in both houses. In order for a new bill to pass it requires a constitutional majority.

===Appointments===
According to the state constitution, three positions in state government collectively referred to as the &quot;Constitutional Officers&quot; — the secretary of state, state treasurer, and the Comptroller of the Treasury — are selected by the General Assembly in joint session, where each member of the General Assembly is afforded a single vote. Each office is awarded to the first candidate to receive a majority of the votes (67 of 132).

The General Assembly selects the seven members of the State Election Commission. It selects four members from the majority party (the one controlling the majority of the 132 total seats) and three members from the minority party.

===Gubernatorial election dispute===
A contested gubernatorial election is supposed to be decided by a joint session of the General Assembly, according to statutory law. The General Assembly is also required to decide the result of the gubernatorial election by joint session according to the state constitution in the event of an exact tie in the popular vote, an extremely unlikely election result.

===Amending the State Constitution===

The General Assembly can propose amendments to the state constitution, but only through one of the two available time-consuming processes:

====Legislative initiative====
For the legislature to propose amendments to the state constitution directly, an amendment must first be passed by an absolute majority of the membership of each house during one term of the Assembly. Then, during the next General Assembly term, each house must pass the amendment again, this time by a two-thirds majority.

The amendment must then be put on the statewide ballot, but only at a time when an election for governor is also being held. The amendment to be passed must receive over half of the total votes cast in the gubernatorial election in order to be ratified and come into effect.

The 1870 constitution of Tennessee had never been amended in this manner until 1998, when the &quot;Victims&#x27; Rights Amendment&quot; was added. A similar process was used in 2002 to enact the state lottery.

Two amendments proposed by the General Assembly were presented to voters on the 2006 ballot. In 2005 the &quot;Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment,&quot; specifying that only marriages between a man and a woman could be legally recognized in the state, was approved for submission to the voters in 2006. The ACLU had previously challenged the validity of the amendment by asserting that a constitutional obligation to publicly advertise the amendment had not been satisfied. However, on February 23, 2006, Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle ruled that the proposed amendment would be on the ballot in 2006. Both that amendment and an amendment authorizing exemption of senior citizens from property tax increases were approved by voters in November 2006.

In 2010, voters approved an amendment providing a right to hunt and fish within state regulations.

====Constitutional convention====
The other method of amending the state constitution, and the one used for all amendments prior to 1998, is for the General Assembly to put on the ballot the question of whether a limited constitutional convention should be called for the purpose of considering amendments to certain specified provisions of the constitution.

If the voters approve this in a statewide election they then, at the next statewide election, elect delegates to this convention. This body then meets (in the House chamber of the Tennessee State Capitol) and makes its recommendations. These recommendations can be voted on in any election, either one specially called or in conjunction with other statewide elections, and need only pass by a simple majority of those casting votes.

This method can not be employed more often than once every six years.

<doc id="904502" wikidata="Q1512242" url="?curid=904502" title="Holland Codes">
<text>The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes (RIASEC) refers to a taxonomy of interests based on a theory of careers and vocational choice that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland.

The Holland Codes serve as a component of the interests assessment, the Strong Interest Inventory. In addition, the US Department of Labor&#x27;s Employment and Training Administration has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the &quot;Interests&quot; section of its free online database O*NET (Occupational Information Network) since its inception during the late 1990s.

==Overview==
Holland&#x27;s theories of vocational choice, &quot;The Holland Occupational Themes&quot;, &quot;now pervades career counseling research and practice&quot;. Its origins &quot;can be traced to an article in the &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot; in 1958 and a subsequent article in 1959 that set out his theory of vocational choices. ... The basic premise was that one&#x27;s occupational preferences were in a sense a veiled expression of underlying character.&quot; The 1959 article in particular (&quot;A Theory of Vocational Choice&quot;, published in the &quot;Journal of Counseling Psychology&quot;) is considered the first major introduction of Holland&#x27;s &quot;theory of vocational personalities and work environments&quot;. 

Holland originally labeled his six types as &quot;motoric, intellectual, esthetic, supportive, persuasive, and conforming&quot;. He later developed and changed them to: &quot;Realistic (Doers), Investigative (Thinkers), Artistic (Creators), Social (Helpers), Enterprising (Persuaders), and Conventional (Organizers)&quot;. Holland&#x27;s six categories show some correlation with each other. It is called the RIASEC model or the hexagonal model because the initial letter of the region is equal to R-I-A-S-E-C when it is expressed as a circle connecting the regions of high correlation. Professor John Johnson of Penn State suggested that an alternative way of categorizing the six types would be through ancient social roles: &quot;hunters (Realistic), shamans (Investigative), artisans (Artistic), healers (Social), leaders (Enterprising), and lorekeepers (Conventional)&quot;. Holland offers full definitions of each type in his book, &quot;Making Vocational Choices: A Theory of Vocational Personalities and Work Environments (Third Edition)’’ (1997). 

According to the &quot;Committee on Scientific Awards&quot;, Holland&#x27;s &quot;research shows that personalities seek out and flourish in career environments they fit and that jobs and career environments are classifiable by the personalities that flourish in them&quot;. Holland also wrote of his theory that &quot;the choice of a vocation is an expression of personality&quot;. Furthermore, while Holland suggested that people can be &quot;categorized as one of six types&quot;, he also argued that &quot;a six-category scheme built on the assumption that there are only six kinds of people in the world is unacceptable on the strength of common sense alone. But a six category scheme that allows a simple ordering of a person&#x27;s resemblance to each of the six models provides the possibility of 720 different personality patterns.&quot;

== Related model ==

=== Prediger&#x27;s two-dimensional model ===
Prediger constructed the scale of &quot;work task&quot; and &quot;work relevant abilities&quot; based on Holland&#x27;s model, and carried out factor analysis and multidimensional scale analysis to clarify the basic structure. As a result, two axes of Data/Ideas and Things/People were extracted. Although Prediger&#x27;s inquiry did not start from interest per se, it eventually led to the birth of models other than RIASEC, suggesting that the structure of occupational interest may provide a basic dimension.

=== Tracey and Rounds&#x27;s octagonal model ===
In the United States, the energetic trial is being made with the aim of the new model which surpasses Holland hexagon model in 1990&#x27;s. Tracey &amp; Rounds&#x27;s octagonal model is one such example. Based on the empirical data, they argue that occupational interests can be placed circularly in a two-dimensional plane consisting of People/Things and Data/ldeas axes, and the number of regions can be arbitrarily determined. According to their model, only Holland&#x27;s hexagonal model does not adequately represent the structure of occupational interest, and it is possible to retain validity as an octagonal or 16 square model if necessary.

Tracey, Watanabe, &amp; Schneider conducted an international comparative study of job interests among Japanese and U.S. university students, and the results suggest that the Tracey &amp; Rounds&#x27;s octagonal model is more fitted to Japanese students than Holland&#x27;s hexagonal model.
=== Tracey and Rounds&#x27;s spherical model ===
Tracey &amp; Rounds criticizes that the conventional models of occupational interest structure do not correctly depict the positional relationship of occupations because they neglect occupational prestige, i.e., &quot;social prestige&quot; or &quot;high socioeconomic status&quot; and proposes a spherical model that assigns occupations to a 3-dimensional space incorporating occupational prestige. In this model, 18 regions of interest are displayed on a spherical space. The left hemisphere has a high status area, with Health Sciences at the top. The right hemisphere has a low status area, with Service Provision as the lowest ground.

Though this model is excellent in the point of more accurately describing the relation between various occupations, it makes the occupation interest structure more complicated, and there is a weak point that it is difficult to be adapted to the data except for the U.S.

==List of types==
===R: Realistic (Doers)===
Holland defines the &quot;Realistic Type&quot; as a person who has “a preference for activities that entail the explicit, ordered, or systematic manipulation of objects, tools, machines, and animals…these behavioral tendencies lead in turn to the acquisition of manual, mechanical, agricultural, electrical, and technical competencies.” Sample majors and careers include:

<text>Henry Alexander Baldwin or Harry Alexander Baldwin (January 12, 1871 – October 8, 1946) was an American businessman and politician who served as Congressional Delegate to the United States House of Representatives representing the Territory of Hawaii. He was one of the earliest leaders of the Hawaii Republican Party. He was president of the Maui Agricultural Company and director of Baldwin Bank, which later became part of First Hawaiian Bank.

== Life ==
Baldwin was born on January 12, 1871, in the Baldwin house at the Paliuli sugar mill, between the towns of Pāia and Makawao, on Maui, Kingdom of Hawaii. His father Henry Perrine Baldwin and uncle Samuel Thomas Alexander had established Alexander &amp; Baldwin, one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; corporations that dominated Hawaii economics in the early twentieth century, in 1869. His father was son of early missionary Dwight Baldwin, and his mother Emily Whitney Alexander was daughter of early missionary William P. Alexander. Baldwin was educated in Honolulu at Punahou School. His parents sent him to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 1889. In 1894, Baldwin obtained a degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity.

He returned to work for his father and uncle on the Haiku sugarcane plantation. From 1897 to 1904 he became manager. Sugarcane production became very profitable with increasing trade with the United States and annexation of Hawaii in 1898. Haiku merged with the Pāia plantation, and he became president of the combined operation called the Maui Agricultural Company. 
He served as president of Maui Telephone Company, and Maui Publishing Company. He was a director of Baldwin Bank, which later became part of First Hawaiian Bank. In 1916, during World War I, he served as colonel of the 3rd Regiment of the Hawaii National Guard. On July 19, 1897, he married Ethel Frances Smith (1879–1967), daughter of lawyer William Owen Smith in Honolulu — his younger brother Samuel would later marry sister Katherine Smith. They had one daughter, Frances Hobron (1904–1996) who married J. Walter Cameron (1895–1976), manager of the pineapple plantation in Honolua.
Cameron&#x27;s company Maui Pineapple Company merged with Baldwin&#x27;s pineapple business to become the Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Company. The Camerons&#x27; son Colin Cameron founded the Kapalua Bay Hotel &amp; Villas resort.
The pineapple business continued until 2009.

== Politics ==
Baldwin became county chairman for the Hawaii Republican Party in 1912.
He entered local politics in 1913 when he was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate. He was territorial senator until 1921 when he was called to higher office to fulfill the unexpired term of Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaole in Washington, D.C., who had died. Baldwin was elected to fill the vacancy for Congressional Delegate from March 25, 1922, to March 3, 1923. Despite pleas to continue service, he retired from politics and returned to his private business ventures. Baldwin emerged from retirement to serve in the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives in 1933. Following a single term, Baldwin returned to the upper chamber where he became territory senate president in 1937. He died at Pāia, Maui on October 8, 1946, and was buried in Makawao Cemetery.

==Legacy==
A beach park near Pāia, originally a company recreation facility, is named for him at .
The 1917 mansion designed by his cousin architect Charles William Dickey called Kaluanui is now the home of Hui Noeau Visual Arts Center. It is located at 2841 Baldwin Avenue, Makawao, .

<text>Altan are an Irish folk music band formed in County Donegal in 1987 by lead vocalist Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh and her husband Frankie Kennedy. The group were primarily influenced by traditional Irish language songs from Donegal and have sold over a million records.

The group were the first traditional Irish group to be signed to a major label when they signed with Virgin Records in 1994. The group has collaborated with Dolly Parton, Enya, The Chieftains, Bonnie Raitt, Alison Krauss, and many others.

== Origin ==
As an 18-year-old young student and musician from Belfast, Frankie Kennedy used to travel to Gweedore, County Donegal on his summer holidays, learning Irish and playing traditional Irish music on Irish flute and tin whistle. There he met native 14-year-old Irish-speaker and musician Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, the daughter of musician Proinsias Ó Maonaigh from Gweedore and the two fell in love with each other but Ní Mhaonaigh being very young, an innocent friendship began. When she was 15, she was allowed to go to dances under her brother Gearóid Ó Maonaigh&#x27;s watchful eye, and gradually Frankie Kennedy and Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh became a couple. They both took jobs as trainee teachers at St. Patrick&#x27;s College in Dublin. In 1979, the two musicians made their recording debut as accompanists for the well-known Belfast singer and Gaelic enthusiast Albert Fry on his self-titled debut album. (In total, Ní Mhaonaigh and Kennedy would feature on the first three albums of Albert Fry.) Two years later, in 1981, Ní Mhaonaigh and Kennedy graduated from college and married when Mairéad was 21.

==History==
=== Pre-Altan years: Ní Mhaonaigh &amp; Kennedy ===
Kennedy and Ní Mhaonaigh had moved to Dublin and were both teaching at St. Oliver Plunkett primary school in Malahide. At the time, they were also playing music in the folk clubs around Dublin. Ní Mhaonaigh had learned the Donegal style of fiddle-playing from her father. However, Donegal music was little known outside of the county at the time. Kennedy&#x27;s repertoire included a number of obscure northern flute tunes drawn from his travels in County Tyrone and County Fermanagh.

In the early 1980s, Ní Mhaonaigh formed a (short-lived) band named Ragairne with Kennedy, Gearóid Ó Maonaigh (Mairéad&#x27;s brother) and a then unknown musician from Gweedore, Eithne Ní Bhraonáin, later known as Enya. People became interested in their repertoire of Donegal tunes. The group&#x27;s members contributed to Mairéad and Frankie&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ceol Aduaidh&quot; (which means &quot;Music of the North&quot;), produced by Nicky Ryan and released in 1983 by Gael-Linn Records. The album is a collection of Gaelic songs and Ulster jigs and reels.

After the release of their first album, Kennedy and Ní Mhaonaigh were invited to America, and they quickly realised there was a market there. They then took a career break from teaching, which ultimately became permanent.

The two started to tour with two additional members Ciarán Curran (on bouzouki) and Mark Kelly (on guitar), performing their first ever live concert as a four-member ensemble on 1 June 1985 at St. John&#x27;s Church in Listowel, County Kerry, Ireland, this line-up – with no name yet – being the core of the future Altan band.

Inspired by the success of their debut effort, they began to work on a new group of ballads and jigs from the North. The result was the album &quot;Altan&quot;, released in 1987 on the Green Linnet Records label, named after a lake which sits in the shadow of Errigal near Gweedore, County Donegal. In the Irish language, &quot;altan&quot; also means &quot;stream&quot;. The album features many of the musicians who would later join the band.

=== 1987–1994: &quot;Horse with a Heart&quot;, &quot;The Red Crow&quot;, &quot;Harvest Storm&quot;, &quot;Island Angel&quot; ===
Shortly after the release in 1987 of &quot;Altan&quot;, their second studio album, Ní Mhaonaigh and Kennedy named their ensemble &quot;Altan&quot; after the name of the album, the band&#x27;s line-up remaining unchanged as a quartet including Kennedy on flute, Ní Mhaonaigh on fiddle and vocals, Ciarán Curran on bouzouki and Mark Kelly on guitar. Later on, Dublin&#x27;s Paul O&#x27;Shaughnessy joined the band on fiddle, participating in the first three Green Linnet recordings (1989–1992).

In 1989, Altan released their debut album, &quot;Horse with a Heart&quot;.

In 1990, Altan released &quot;The Red Crow&quot;, which became the first of three Altan albums to win the &quot;Celtic/British Isles Album of the Year&quot; award from the National Association of Independent Record Distributors and Manufactures (NAIRD).

In 1992, Ciarán Tourish on fiddle &amp; whistle and Dáithí Sproule on guitar joined the band for the &quot;Harvest Storm&quot; recording. With the arrival of Dáithí Sproule, Mark and Dáithí shared the role of guitarist, Mark touring with the band in Europe and Dáithí in the United States. In June 1992, Frankie Kennedy learned he had Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma, a type of cancer that attacks bone structure. He endured surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy simultaneously continuing his work with Altan.

In 1993, the band released &quot;Island Angel&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; cited &quot;Island Angel&quot; as the fourth-best-selling album of world music in 1994. In 1994, they were asked by US President Bill Clinton to perform at the White House on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, and they played for him again on his visit to Ireland in 1998. Also, the President of Ireland Mary McAleese requested they accompany her on several State visits.

=== 1994–2000: Kennedy&#x27;s death, major label, &quot;Blackwater&quot;, &quot;Runaway Sunday&quot; ===
While battling with cancer, Frankie Kennedy continued to steer the band to international recognition, negotiating with Virgin Records UK to sign the band. Frankie Kennedy died on 19 September 1994. After a period of mourning, the band resumed their touring as requested by Kennedy himself before he died. They became the first traditional group to be signed to a major label when they signed with Virgin Records.

Dermot Byrne, who had previously guested on accordion on two Altan recordings &quot;The Red Crow&quot; (1990) and &quot;Island Angel&quot; (1993), officially joined the band in 1994. The recording line-up became Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh (vocals, fiddle), Ciarán Tourish (fiddle), Mark Kelly (guitar), Ciarán Curran (bouzouki), Dáithí Sproule (guitar) and Dermot Byrne (accordion) and remained unchanged until Dermot Byrne&#x27;s departure in 2013.

In 1995, Green Linnet Records released Altan&#x27;s first greatest-hits package titled &quot;The First Ten Years&quot;.

In April 1996, Altan released &quot;Blackwater&quot;, their first album on Virgin Records.

In July 1997, Altan released their next album, &quot;Runaway Sunday&quot;, which featured their version of &quot;Gleanntáin Ghlas&#x27; Ghaoth Dobhair&quot;, a song written by Mairéad&#x27;s father and a favourite at all their live shows.

=== 2000–2009: &quot;Another Sky&quot;, &quot;The Blue Idol&quot;, hiatus ===
In 2000, the group released &quot;Another Sky&quot;, their first album on the Narada label.

In 2002, &quot;The Blue Idol&quot; featured the vocals of American singer Dolly Parton, who became close friends with the group after she invited them to play on her 2001 album &quot;Little Sparrow&quot;. The album garnered them the award for &quot;Best Group&quot; at the BBC &quot;Radio 2 Folk Awards&quot;.

In 2002, Altan, along with other artists signed to Green Linnet such as Cherish the Ladies, sued for unpaid royalties. Most artists were paid and most claims were settled in 2006 as Compass Records (who would later sign Altan) bought the company.

In 2003, they released another greatest hits compilation CD called &quot;The Best of Altan: The Songs&quot;.

In 2005, they released &quot;Local Ground&quot; which met with positive reviews.

Altan then went on hiatus. Some members released their debut solo album: Ciarán Tourish released &quot;Down The Line&quot; (2005), Dáithí Sproule released &quot;The Crow in the Sun&quot; (2007) and Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh released &quot;Imeall&quot; (2009).

=== 2009–2011: 25th anniversary ===
In April 2009, Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh announced that the band would be going into the studio in early May 2009 to record a new Altan album with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra just after a show on 7 May 2009 in Pornichet, France (near Saint-Nazaire).

In July 2009, Ní Mhaonaigh announced that Altan would also release their first DVD as the video recording of a concert on 14 August 2009 in the National Concert Hall (NCH), Dublin, Ireland (again with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra).

To commemorate their 25th anniversary, Altan released &quot;25th Anniversary Celebration&quot;, a compilation album of studio re-recordings of previous material (plus one brand new song) with the contribution of the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. It was made available in January 2010 in Japan (where it had its launch in December 2009 during Altan&#x27;s Winter 2009/2010 Japanese tour), in February 2010 in Ireland and the UK and in March 2010 in North America.

After a few European dates in January, February and April 2010 and an extensive 18-date (March to April) tour of the United States, Altan launched on 23 April 2010 in Dublin, Ireland their 14-date &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; tour of Ireland which would run from April to June. During Summer 2010, Altan took part in a few European festivals. A 10-date tour of UK and Ireland took place in September 2010.

=== 2011–2014: &quot;Gleann Nimhe – The Poison Glen&quot; and touring ===
From April 2011 to January 2012, Altan recorded a new studio album titled &quot;Gleann Nimhe – The Poison Glen&quot;.

After celebrating the launch of the 18th Frankie Kennedy Winter School programme on 29 November 2011 by performing a show taking place during the Liffey Banks Sessions at The Grand Social, Dublin, Ireland, Altan celebrated the New Year 2012, then forthcoming release of their new studio album &quot;Gleann Nimhe – The Poison Glen&quot; on the occasion of their performance on 1 January 2012 at Scoil Gheimhridh Frankie Kennedy, Ionad Cois Locha, Gweedore, County Donegal, Ireland during which they played some new tracks from it.

Exactly seven years after &quot;Local Ground&quot;, Altan released &quot;Gleann Nimhe – The Poison Glen&quot;, their new studio album of original material, on Compass Records in the US on 28 February 2012, in Europe &amp; Australia on 8 March 2012, in Ireland on 9 March 2012 and in the UK on 12 March 2012. Started in April 2011, the recording took place in famous sound engineer &amp; bass player Billy Robinson&#x27;s Steeples Studios in Ramelton, Ireland and ended in early January 2012.

The album features &quot;An Ghealóg&quot;, a song composed by Martin Tourish who would later join the band replacing Dermot Byrne, temporarily starting from the Autumn 2013 (mostly) German tour and permanently since Dermot Byrne&#x27;s departure from the band in early 2014.

=== 2014–2017: &quot;The Widening Gyre&quot; and touring ===
;2014 
On 3 June 2014, on their Twitter page and the Pledge Music website, Altan announced that they were working on a new studio album to be recorded in Nashville, Tennessee. The band had started rehearsing potential material for the album with the intention to perform some of these new pieces at various concerts over the summer.

While on a 5-show US tour in July–August 2014, the band – Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, Ciarán Tourish, Ciarán Curran, Daíthí Sproule, Mark Kelly and Martin Tourish (replacing Dermot Byrne) – began recording their new album in Nashville, Tennessee.

In October 2014, Altan confirmed that their new album was being mixed and that they &quot;hope[d] to have it [released] in the Spring of 2015&quot;, and that it would contain &quot;loads of surprises&quot;.

On 5 November 2014, Altan published a snippet of a new track titled &quot;White Birds&quot; which was recorded with an undisclosed musical guest.

In late November 2014, Altan announced the names of some guest musicians who they collaborated with: Eddi Reader on vocals, Jerry Douglas (from Union Station and Transatlantic Sessions) on Dobro, Alison Brown, Bruce Molsky, Mike McGoldrick, Natalie Haas, Jim Higgins and Darol Anger.

On 5 December 2014, Altan took part in the Great British Folk Festival in Skegness, Lincolnshire, UK. During the show, Ciarán Tourish announced that they &quot;have a new album almost finished [which] has been mastered&quot; and about which they &quot;can do any more with it [for] it&#x27;s done&quot; just before the band went into playing a new medley (taken from it) entitled &quot;The Tin Key / Sam Kelly&#x27;s Jig / The Gravediggers&quot;.

On 19 December 2014, Altan revealed the names of the final guests having participated in the recording of the new album: Mary Chapin Carpenter, Todd Phillips, Garry West, Julee Glaub Weems, Kenny Malone and Stuart Duncan and offered (for listening and downloading) a (very) short audio excerpt (18 seconds) of one new instrumental titled &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot;.

;2015 
In January 2015, Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh explained why Altan called on Pledge Music&#x27;s services in order to produce the new studio album and thanked all the pledgers for helping Altan with the fundraising campaign and for bringing it to completion (reaching, at that time, 101% of goal): &quot;The music business is a changing world for professional musicians as ourselves. We depend more on live concerts to make our living. We can no longer depend on big record company funding to get our music out there, we have to do it ourselves. Now with your help we have funded our latest album which we are really happy with.&quot; She also stated that Altan have licensed the new album to Compass Records in the US, that Gary West of Compass co-produced it and that after 30 years recording studio albums, Altan &quot;have taken a new approach with this one.&quot; The Altan Pledge Music pre-order page announced that all exclusive pre-orders would be fulfilled by 17 February 2015.

The band later announced that the new album would be released in Ireland on 20 February 2015, in the UK on 23 February 2015 and in the US on 24 February 2015, and would be titled &quot;The Widening Gyre&quot;, taken from &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, a poem by W. B. Yeats, the first Irishman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh revealed the album&#x27;s cover artwork, by artist friend Édaín O&#x27;Donnell, who previously designed the &quot;Gleann Nimhe – The Poison Glen&quot; cover.

On 26 January 2015, Altan&#x27;s official website published a presentation of their new studio album entitled anew &quot;The Widening Gyre&quot; giving many details about the new album: the new musical direction taken by the band, the album recording process and the participation of numerous guest musicians as well as the titles of some of the new tracks. The very same day, on their &quot;Widening Gyre&quot; iTunes page, Altan revealed the titles of the 14 tracks from their new studio album and released them for sale.

On 27 January 2015, on their &quot;Widening Gyre&quot; Compass Records page, Altan made available short snippets of their new tracks.

On 22 February 2015 in Charleston, WV (at Culture Center Theater, Mountain Stage Radio), Altan embarked on an extensive 25-date Winter/Spring North American tour which ended on 3 April 2015 in Greeley, Colorado (at the Union Colony Civic Center) visiting the Canada only twice: on 18 March 2015 in St. Albert, Alberta (at the Arden Theatre) and on 19 March 2015 in North Vancouver, BC (at the Centennial Theatre Centre).

;2016 
Almost a year after the beginning of their extensive 25-date Winter/Spring 2015 North American tour, Altan embarked on 19 February 2016 in Northampton, Massachusetts in another extensive North American tour (but exclusively visiting the US), their 25-date Winter/Spring 2016 US tour which ended on 25 March 2016 in Spokane, Washington. An extensive (18-date) Spring 2016 UK tour followed in April and May 2016, including one Scotland leg and two England legs from 8 April in Hindhead, Surrey to 7 May 2016 in Stornoway, Scotland, including a London show at Kings Place on 9 April 2016.

;2017 

Altan celebrated their 30th anniversary year with a Winter tour of Europe in January 2017, visiting The Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland and France within this month. On this tour, the core of the band (made of Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, Ciarán Curran, Ciarán Tourish, Mark Kelly, Martin Tourish) is joined with a newcomer, John Joe Kelly on bodhrán. Altan have also announced for 2017 a 17-date US Winter tour in February and March 2017.

After more than 25 years as a band member (he had joined Altan in September 1991 for the &quot;Harvest Storm&quot; recording sessions), Ciarán Tourish (fiddle, backing vocals) left the band (for personal reasons) after the show Altan performed on 29 July 2017 in Lyon, France, at Les Nuits de Fourvière Festival. He was not replaced until fiddle player Clare Friel joined the band, at first as a guest musician for the Autumn 2022 and Spring 2023 US tours, then as a permanent member in July 2023.

=== 2017–2024: &quot;The Gap of Dreams&quot; and touring ===

On 23 February 2018, Altan embarked on a new (one-month) North-American tour.

On 2 March 2018, Altan released their new studio album entitled &quot;The Gap of Dreams&quot; which they had recorded in November 2017.

On 15 March 2020, Altan announced that their ongoing US Spring Tour 2020 had come to a halt because of the coronavirus situation and that they had been advised to return to Ireland as soon as possible. Altan&#x27;s booking agency was due to reschedule all 9 remaining (15–29 March 2020) concerts for the following Autumn 2020 or next Spring 2021 but the pandemic prevented it. Nevertheless, it appears that Altan performed their last two scheduled shows in Ireland on 18 April 2020 at Copper Coast TradFest in Dunhill, County Waterford and on 24 April 2020 at Club Ceol Aislann in Kilcar, County Donegal. Besides, Altan&#x27;s bus tour with Hammond Tours scheduled for 12–19 September 2020 might have happened as well.

After a unique 2021 show on 26 November 2021 at Áislann Chill Chartha, Kilcar, Co. Donegal and their annual week residence at Scoil Gheimhridh Ghaoth Dobhair, Ghaoth Dobhair (also Co. Donegal) from 27 December 2021 to 1 January 2022, Altan resumed touring in March 2022, performing 3 shows in London and 3 shows in France this month, and another 6 shows in Ireland from March to October.

Two extensive (23-date) US Autumn and (15-date) US Spring tours ensued, respectively in October–November 2022 and March 2023 (after a unique show in Ireland on 3 February 2023 at Seamus Heaney HomePlace, Bellaghy, Magherafelt, County Londonderry). These new US dates marked Altan&#x27;s first shows in the US in two and a half years (since the aborted US Spring Tour in March 2020).

Since then, Altan embarked on a 4-show tour of Ireland in the Spring and Summer of 2023 and performed 2 shows in France: on 1 April 2023 at La Coursive (scène nationale), La Rochelle, Nouvelle-Aquitaine and with l&#x27;Orchestre National de Bretagne on 9 August 2023 at the Lorient Interceltic Festival, Lorient, Brittany.

Born in Glasgow with her family roots firmly entrenched in the Donegal Gaeltacht (Derrynamansher), fiddle player Clare Friel permanently joined Altan in July 2023. She is the first female member to join the band since Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh since the band&#x27;s start. A former Gradaim Cheoil Young Musician of the Year winner, Clare Friel is from The (Anna, Sheila and Clare) Friel Sisters and from The SíFiddlers.

=== 2024–present: new album &quot;Donegal&quot; and touring ===
On 24 January 2024, Altan performed at the Glasgow Celtic Connections with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the Scottish fiddle female quartet RANT.&quot; A 5-date tour of Ireland ensued: starting on 26 January in Dublin at Temple Bar Tradfest, it included concerts on 1 February with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra in Kildare at the C. Kildare St. Brigid&#x27;s Cathedral and on 2 February in Galway at the Town Hall Theatre. It is due to include a performance on 23 February at the Belfast Winter Tradfest and to end on 3 March 2024 in Killarney at the Gathering Traditional Irish Music Festival. Altan is due to embark on a 15-date US tour on 8 March 2024 in Sacramento at Sofia Tsakopoulos Center, due to end on 27 March 2024 in Chicago at the Old Town School of Folk Music.

On 7 February 2024, it was officially announced the upcoming release on 1 March 2024 on Compass Records of Altan&#x27;s new studio album entitled &quot;Donegal&quot;. This is their first studio album to be released in 6 years. The announcement reads: &quot;&quot;Donegal&quot; captures the essence of the region which has inspired Altan since the band&#x27;s inception and further cements Altan&#x27;s legacy as one of the great cultural treasures of Ireland.&quot;

== Band members ==
=== Recording line-up ===
Since the arrival of accordionist Dermot Byrne in 1994, the band recording line-up has remained unchanged until his definitive departure from the band some time in 2013 and his lasting replacement since then by Martin Tourish (Ciarán Tourish&#x27;s cousin). Incidentally, Martin Tourish wrote (but didn&#x27;t record) the song &quot;An Ghealóg&quot; from the 2012 Altan studio album &quot;Gleann Nimhe – The Poison Glen&quot;.

Since July 2023, the band recording line-up has become:
* Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh – lead vocal, fiddle
* Ciarán Curran – bouzouki
* Mark Kelly – guitar
* Dáithí Sproule – guitar, vocals
* Martin Tourish – accordion
* Clare Friel – fiddle

=== Touring line-up ===
Based on the recording line-up, the band touring line-up may differ at times:
* Dáithí Sproule (guitar) replaces Mark Kelly when touring with the band, mostly in the US but also in Europe (for instance during the entire 14-date Spring 2012 Norwegian tour).
* Martin Tourish on accordion has permanently replaced Dermot Byrne, starting from the extensive Autumn 2013 (mostly) German tour (from 12 to 30 November 2013) after an 8-month hiatus (starting from March 2013) during which Altan had no longer been playing with any accordionist (as Dermot Byrne had not been playing with the band since then).
* Clare Friel joined the band as a guest musician on fiddle for the Autumn 2022 and Spring 2023 US tours. She permanently joined the band in July 2023.

<doc id="904516" wikidata="Q1426877" url="?curid=904516" title="Foreign object damage">
<text>In aviation and aerospace, the term foreign object damage (FOD) refers to any damage to an aircraft attributed to foreign object debris (also referred to as &quot;FOD&quot;), which is any particle or substance, alien to an aircraft or system which could potentially cause damage to it.
External FOD hazards include bird strikes, hail, ice, sandstorms, ash-clouds or objects left on a runway or flight deck. Internal FOD hazards include items left in the cockpit that interfere with flight safety by getting tangled in control cables, jam moving parts or short-out electrical connections.

==To jet engines==
Jet engines can suffer major damage from even small objects being sucked into the engine. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that all engine types pass a test which includes firing a fresh chicken (dead, but not frozen) into a running jet engine from a small cannon. The engine does not have to remain functional after the test, but it must not cause significant damage to the rest of the aircraft. Thus, if the bird strike causes it to &quot;throw a blade&quot; (break apart in a way where parts fly off at high speed), doing so must not cause loss of the aircraft.

==Engine and airframe designs which avoid FOD==
Some military aircraft had a unique design to prevent FOD from damaging the engine. The design included an S-shaped bend in the airflow, so that air entered the inlet, was bent back towards the front of the plane, and bent back again towards the back before entering the engine. At the back of the first bend a strong spring held a door shut. Any foreign object flying in the intake flew in, hit the door, opened it, flew through, and then exited the aircraft. Thus, only small objects swept up by the air could enter the engine. This design did indeed prevent FOD problems, but the constriction and drag induced by the bending of the airflow reduced the engine&#x27;s effective power, and thus the design was not repeated.

A similar approach is used on many turboshaft-powered helicopters, such as the Mi-24, which use a &quot;vortex-type&quot; or &quot;centrifugal&quot; intake, in which the air is forced to flow through a spiral path before entering the engine; the heavier dust and other debris are forced outwards, where it is separated from the airflow before it enters the engine inlet.

The Russian Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighters have a special intake design to prevent ingestion of FOD during take-off from rough airfields. The main air intakes could be closed with mesh doors and special inlets on the top of the intakes temporarily opened. This would allow enough airflow to the engine for take-off but reduced the chances of the engine sucking up objects from the ground.

Another interesting design to minimize the risk of FOD is that of the Antonov An-74, which has a very high placement of the engines.

Boeing offered a gravel runway kit for early 737s that allows the plane to be used from unimproved and gravel runways, in spite of having very low-slung engines. This kit included gravel deflectors on the landing gear; foldaway lights on the bottom of the plane; and screens that prevented gravel, which would enter the open wheelwells when the gear was extended, from hitting critical components. The kit also included vortex dissipators, devices which would reduce the airflow into the engine from the bottom so as to reduce the likelihood of ingesting gravel.
Airbus engineers are investigating a novel approach to reducing FOD. By developing, in conjunction with Israel Aerospace Industries, the Taxibot, a tractor controlled by the pilot, aircraft will not need to use jet engines while taxiing, and therefore they will not be vulnerable to FOD on aprons or taxiways.

==Examples==

===Vehicle tire track-in===
Debris is often trapped in the treads of tires from vehicles coming onto an airfield. Types of debris trapped in a vehicle tire can include rocks, mud, stones, loose hardware (screws, washers, bolts, etc.) and many other forms of small materials. These can be crew and fuel trucks, maintenance vehicles and many others that inadvertently bring debris to a flight line and deposit it there. These types of FOD are very difficult to track and manage once they are introduced onto the airfield. A jet engine intake, engine blast, and propeller or helicopter rotor draft then can pick up the debris easily. This material, once loose around operational aircraft, can lead to serious safety concerns, including personnel injury and equipment and property damage.

===Runway debris===
The crash of a Concorde, Air France Flight 4590, at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris on 25 July 2000 was caused by FOD; in this case a piece of titanium debris on the runway which had been part of a thrust reverser that had fallen from a Continental Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10 during takeoff about four minutes earlier. The debris strike caused a tire to explode. Rubber debris from the tire struck the wing, rupturing a fuel tank and starting a severe fire leading to loss of control. All 100 passengers and nine crew on board the flight, as well as four people on the ground, were killed.

A Gates Learjet 36A, registration number N527PA, was taking off from Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport in Virginia on March 26, 2007, when the crew heard a loud &quot;pop&quot;. Aborting the takeoff, the crew tried to control the &quot;fishtailing&quot; and activate the drogue parachute. The parachute did not work and the Learjet ran off the runway, its tires blown. Airport personnel reported seeing rocks and pieces of metal on the runway after the accident. The National Transportation Safety Board said that the accident was caused by FOD on the runway. Failure of the drogue parachute contributed to the accident.

===Volcanic ash===
On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9 en route to Perth, Australia, flew into a volcanic ash cloud over the Indian Ocean. The Boeing 747-200B suffered engine surges in all four engines until they all failed. The passengers and crew could see a phenomenon known as St. Elmo&#x27;s fire around the plane. Flight 9 dived down until it exited the cloud allowing the airborne ash to clear the engines, which were then restarted. The cockpit windshield was badly pitted by the ash particles but the aircraft landed safely.

On 15 December 1989, KLM Flight 867, en route to Narita International Airport, Tokyo flew through a thick cloud of volcanic ash from Mount Redoubt, which had erupted the day before. The Boeing 747-400&#x27;s four engines flamed out. After descending more than 14,000 feet, the crew restarted the engines and landed safely at Anchorage International Airport.

Although unrelated to volcanic ash, in 1991, an MD-81 operated by SAS, force landed in a forest after ice was reportedly ingested into both engines. All 129 people survived, the aircraft was written off.

===Item jettisoned from aircraft===
An unusual case of FOD occurred on 28 September 1981 over Chesapeake Bay. During flight testing of an F/A-18 Hornet, the Naval Air Test Center of the United States Navy was using a Douglas TA-4J Skyhawk as a chase plane to film a jettison test of a bomb rack from the Hornet. The bomb rack struck the right wing of the Skyhawk, shearing off almost half the wing. The Skyhawk caught fire within seconds of being struck; the two persons on board ejected.

===Bird strikes===

On 20 November 1975 a Hawker Siddeley HS.125 taking off at Dunsfold Aerodrome flew through a flock of northern lapwings immediately after lifting off the runway and lost power in both engines. The crew landed the aircraft back on the runway but it overran the end and crossed a road. The aircraft struck a car on the road, killing its six occupants. Although the aircraft was destroyed in the ensuing fire, the nine occupants of the aircraft survived the crash.

On 17 November 1980 a Hawker Siddeley Nimrod of the Royal Air Force crashed shortly after taking off from RAF Kinloss. It flew through a flock of Canada geese, causing three of its four engines to fail. The pilot and copilot were killed; the pilot was subsequently posthumously awarded an Air Force Cross for his actions in maintaining control of the aircraft and saving the lives of the 18 crew. The remains of 77 birds were found on or near the runway.

On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 flew into a flock of Canada geese shortly after takeoff and suffered a double engine failure. The pilot ditched the aircraft in the Hudson River, saving the lives of all on board.

==Wildlife and wetlands near airports==
Significant problems occur with airports where the grounds were or have become nesting areas for birds. While fences can prevent a moose or deer from wandering onto a runway, birds are more difficult to control. Often airports employ a type of bird scarer that operates on propane to cause a noise loud enough to scare away any birds that might be in the vicinity. Airport managers use any means available (including trained falcons as well as robird flapping-wing falcon-like drones) to reduce bird populations. Another solution under investigation is the use of artificial turf near runways, since it does not offer food, shelter, or water to wildlife.

===Conferences===
In the United States, the most prominent gathering of FOD experts has been the annual National Aerospace FOD Prevention Conference. It is hosted in a different city each year by National Aerospace FOD Prevention, Inc. (NAFPI), a nonprofit association that focuses on FOD education, awareness and prevention. Conference information, including presentations from past conferences, is available at the NAFPI Web site. However, NAFPI has come under some critique as being focused on tool control and manufacturing processes, and other members of the industry have stepped forward to fill the gaps. BAA hosted the world&#x27;s first airport-led conference on the subject in November 2010.

==Detection technologies &amp; FOD prevention==

There is some debate regarding FOD detection systems as the costs can be high and the domain of responsibility is not clear. However, one airport claims that their FOD detection system may have paid for itself in a single incident where personnel were alerted to a steel cable on the runway, before a single aircraft was put at risk. The FAA has investigated FOD detection technologies, and has set standards for the following categories:
*Radar
*Electro-optical (visible band imagery (standard CCTV) and low light cameras)
*Hybrid
*RFID on metal
*Manufactured FODS Mats - Track-Out Prevention &amp; Track-In Control

==Damage tolerance improvements==
The negative effects from FOD can be reduced or eliminated by introducing compressive residual stresses in critical fatigue areas into the part during the manufacturing process. These beneficial stresses are induced into the part through cold working the part with peening processes: shot peening, or laser peening. The deeper the compressive residual stress the more significant the fatigue life and damage tolerance improvement. Shot peening typically induces compressive stresses a few thousandths of an inch deep, laser peening typically imparts compressive residual stresses 0.040 to 0.100 inches deep. Laser peen induced compressive stresses are also more resistant to heat exposure.

==Technologies, information and training materials helpful in preventing FOD==

*Aerospace tool control systems
*FOD prevention program manuals
*Magnetic bars
*Promotional and awareness materials
*Tool and parts control/retrieval
*Tow-behind friction sweeper
*Tow-behind sweepers
*Training materials
*Vacuum truck sweepers
*Walk-behind sweepers
*FOD prevention mats

==Economic impact==
Internationally, FOD costs the aviation industry US$13 billion per year in direct plus indirect costs. The indirect costs are as much as ten times the direct cost value, representing delays, aircraft changes, incurred fuel costs, unscheduled maintenance, and the like. and causes expensive, significant damage to aircraft and parts and death and injury to workers, pilots and passengers.

It is estimated that FOD costs major airlines in the United States $26 per flight in aircraft repairs, plus $312 in such additional indirect costs as flight delays, plane changes and fuel inefficiencies.

&quot;There are other costs that are not as easy to calculate but are equally disturbing,&quot; according to UK Royal Air Force Wing Commander and FOD researcher Richard Friend. &quot;From accidents such as the Air France Concorde, Flight AF 4590, there is the loss of life, suffering and effect on the families of those who died, the suspicion of malpractice, guilt, and blame that could last for lifetimes. This harrowing torment is incalculable but should not be forgotten, &quot;ever&quot;. If everyone kept this in mind, we would remain vigilant and forever prevent foreign object debris from causing a problem. In fact, many factors combine to cause a chain of events that can lead to a failure.&quot;

==Studies==
There have only been two detailed studies of the economic cost of FOD for civil airline operations. The first was by Brad Bachtel of Boeing, who published a value of $4 billion USD per year. This top-down value was for several years the standard industry figure for the cost of FOD. The second work (2007) was by Iain McCreary from the consultancy Insight SRI Ltd. This more detailed report offered a first-cut of the cost of FOD, based on a bottom-up analysis of airline maintenance log records. Here, data was broken into &quot;per flight direct costs&quot; and &quot;per flight indirect costs&quot; for the top 300 global airports, with detailed footnotes on the supporting data. The Insight SRI research was a standard reference for 2007–2009 as it was the only source presenting costs and thus was quoted by regulators, airports, and technology providers alike.

However, while that 2007 Insight SRI paper remains the best free public source of data, the new analysis (2010) from Insight SRI offers new numbers. The author of the new report (not free) says &quot;Readers are cautioned not to rely on or in the future refer to numbers from the 2007-08 Insight SRI paper &quot;The Economic Cost of FOD to Airlines&quot;. This earlier effort was &#x27;The&#x27; first document detailing the direct and indirect cost of FOD that was based on airline maintenance data (the entire document was a single page of data, followed by 8 pages of footnotes).&quot;

Per-flight direct costs of $26 are calculated by considering engine maintenance spending, tire replacements, and aircraft body damage.

Per-flight indirect costs include a total of 33 individual categories:

#Airport efficiency losses
#Carbon / environmental issues
#Change of aircraft
#Close airport
#Close runway
#Corporate manslaughter/criminal liability
#Cost of corrective action
#Cost of hiring and training replacement
#Cost of rental or lease of replacement equipment
#Cost of restoration of order
#Cost of the investigation
#Delay for planes in air
#Delays at gate
#Fines and citations
#Fuel efficiency losses
#Hotels
#In-air go-around
#Increased insurance premiums
#Increased operating costs on remaining equipment
#Insurance deductibles
#Legal fees resulting
#Liability claims in excess of insurance
#Loss of aircraft
#Loss of business and damage to reputation
#Loss of productivity of injured personnel
#Loss of spares or specialized equipment
#Lost time and overtime
#Missed connections
#Morale
#Reaction by crews leading to disruption of schedule
#Replacement flights on other carriers
#Scheduled maintenance
#Unscheduled maintenance

The study concludes that when these indirect costs are added, then the cost of FOD increases by a multiple of up to 10 times.

Eurocontrol and the FAA are both studying FOD. Eurocontrol released a preliminary assessment of FOD detection technologies in 2006, while the FAA is conducting trials of the four leading systems from Qinetiq (PVD, Providence T. F. Green Airport), Stratech (ORD, Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport), Xsight Systems (BOS, Boston Logan International Airport), and Trex Aviation Systems (ORD, Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport) during 2007 and 2008. Results of this study should be published in 2009.

<text>Orestes Augustus Brownson (September 16, 1803 – April 17, 1876) was an American intellectual, activist, preacher, labor organizer, and writer. Brownson was also a noted Catholic convert.

Brownson was a publicist, a career which spanned his affiliation with the New England Transcendentalists through his subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism.

==Early years and education==
Brownson was born on September 16, 1803, to Sylvester Augustus Brownson and Relief Metcalf, who were farmers in Stockbridge, Vermont. Sylvester Brownson died when Orestes was young and Relief decided to give her son up to a nearby adoptive family when he was six years old.

The adopting family raised Brownson under the strict confines of Calvinist Congregationalism on a small farm in Royalton, Vermont. He did not receive much schooling but enjoyed reading books. Among these were volumes by Homer and Locke and the Bible. In 1817, when he was fourteen, Brownson attended an academy briefly in New York. This was the extent of his formal education.

==Religious unease==
In 1822, Brownson was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in Ballston, New York, but he quickly complained that Presbyterians associated only with themselves, and that the Reformed doctrines of predestination and eternal sin were too harsh.

After withdrawing from Presbyterianism in 1824 and teaching at various schools in upstate New York and Detroit, Brownson applied to be a Universalist preacher. Universalism, for Brownson, represented the only liberal variety of Christianity he knew of. He became the editor of a Universalist journal, &quot;Gospel Advocate and Impartial Investigator&quot;, in which he wrote about his own religious doubt and criticized organized faiths and mysticism in religion.

Later, rejecting Universalism, Brownson became associated with Robert Dale Owen and Fanny Wright in New York City and supported the Working Men&#x27;s Party of New York. In 1830, for a few months, Brownson was editor of the &quot;Genesee Republican&quot; in Batavia, New York.

In 1831, Brownson moved to Ithaca, New York, where he became the pastor of a Unitarian community. There, he began publishing the magazine &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;.

==Transcendentalism==

After the demise of the &quot;Philanthropist&quot; in 1832, Brownson moved to Walpole, New Hampshire, where he became a part of the Transcendentalist movement. He read in English Romanticism and English and French reports on German Idealist philosophy, and was passionate about the work of Victor Cousin and Pierre Leroux. In 1836, Brownson participated in the founding of the Transcendental Club.

Also in 1836, Brownson moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, to set up his own church, calling it &quot;The Society for Christian Union and Progress&quot;, he also published his first book, &quot;New Views of Christianity, Society, and the Church.&quot; This work combined Transcendentalist religious views with radical social egalitarianism, sharply criticizing the unequal social distribution of wealth as un-Christian and unprincipled. After President Martin Van Buren appointed George Bancroft as Collector of Customs at Boston in 1837, Bancroft in turn gave a job to Brownson.

In 1838, Brownson founded the &quot;Boston Quarterly Review&quot;, and served as its editor and main contributor for four years. Other contributors included George Bancroft, Margaret Fuller, George Ripley, and Elizabeth Peabody. Brownson originally offered use of the &quot;Boston Quarterly Review&quot; as a literary vehicle for the Transcendentalists; they declined and instead created &quot;The Dial&quot;.

Brownson&#x27;s essays were political, intellectual, and religious. Among these was a favourable review of Thomas Carlyle’s &quot;Chartism&quot;, separately published as &quot;The Laboring Classes&quot; (1840). The article critiques Carlyle for putting the onus of reform on individual poor people themselves, rather than on the system that impoverishes them. It also objects to the inheritability of private property. The article and Brownson&#x27;s review of it are sometimes blamed for causing Van Buren, whom Brownson avidly supported, to lose the 1840 election to William Henry Harrison. In fact, Van Buren himself is said to have &quot;blamed [Brownson] as the main cause of his defeat&quot; because the &quot;Boston Quarterly Review&quot; had recently promoted socialist ideas.

In 1840 Brownson published his semi-autobiographical work, &quot;Charles Elwood; Or, The Infidel Converted&quot;. Through the protagonist Elwood, Brownson railed against organized religion and questioned the Bible&#x27;s infallibility, or truthfulness. In 1842, Brownson ceased separate publication of the &quot;Boston Quarterly Review&quot;, and it was merged into &quot;The United States Magazine and Democratic Review&quot;. He found it necessary to break with the &quot;Review&quot; after a series of his essays created new scandal.

==Conversion to Catholicism==
In the spring of 1843, rumors spread that Brownson was considering converting to Catholicism, especially when he met with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston. Brownson finally converted on October 20, 1844. He began to believe, in contrast to his Transcendentalist colleagues, in the inherent sinfulness of humanity. Further, he began to associate Protestantism with capitalist notions he despised.

Brownson soon renounced what he now considered the errors of his past, including Transcendentalism and liberalism, and devoted himself to writing articles dedicated to converting America to Catholicism. He used his articles to strike out against his former friends in the Transcendental movement, who, he wrote, would be damned unless they converted as well. He succeeded in persuading Sophia Ripley, wife of George Ripley, to convert, but few others.

According to one scholar, after his conversion, Brownson&#x27;s writing changed, and the work he published in &quot;Brownson&#x27;s Quarterly Review&quot; expressed &quot;&quot;&quot;liberal views [that] frequently got Brownson into trouble, sometimes with the Catholic hierarchy.&quot; His conversion prompted him to be overzealous in defense of the Catholic Church. His unruly enthusiasm resulted in letters from local Catholic journalists and even the bishop of his diocese requesting that he cease leveling such harsh criticisms. Brownson&#x27;s stance had much in common with the liberal Catholicism of Charles de Montalembert, with whom he corresponded, and he published articles in French liberal Catholic publications such as &quot;Le Correspondant&quot;, taking the side of the liberals against the conservative Catholics such as Louis Veuillot.

Brownson had also been writing many articles for the Paulist Fathers&#x27; &quot;Catholic World&quot; publication. Brownson now saw Catholicism as the only religion that could restrain the undisciplined American citizens and thus ensure the success of democracy. To him, the United States was to be a model to the world, and the ideal model was a Catholic America. He repudiated his earlier Fourierist and Owenite ideas, now criticizing socialism and utopianism as vigorously as he had once promoted them.

A staunch Douglas Democrat, Brownson, like Douglas, supported the Union in the Civil War and polemicized against the Confederacy and against Catholic clergy who endorsed secession. He avidly supported emancipation and even made several trips to Washington to discuss the importance and urgency of emancipation with President Lincoln. He encouraged all Americans, especially Catholics, to be patriots in the country’s time of turmoil.

After Brownson&#x27;s conversion, he revived his former publication, now renamed &quot;Brownson&#x27;s Quarterly Review&quot;, in 1844. From 1844 to 1864, Brownson maintained the &quot;Review&quot; as a Catholic journal of opinion, including many reviews of &quot;inspirational novels&quot; meant to encourage Catholic belief.

In 1853, Brownson wrote a series of articles that claimed that the Church was supreme over the State. These writings caused a controversy among Catholic immigrants and the entire Catholic community in general. This controversy caused bishops all over New England to begin condemning his writings. He became increasingly lonely as a result of his being shunned from Boston communities, so he moved the &quot;Review&quot; and his family to New York in 1855, where he revived his interest in Catholic political philosophy.

In 1860, Brownson announced that the Catholic Church must progress towards a welcoming intellectual environment. He argued forcefully and eloquently that &quot;neither the friends nor the enemies of religion have anything to fear from adopting the great principle of civil and religious liberty, and asserting a free Church in a free State.&quot; Brownson noted with dismay how few European Catholics supported abolition, and applauded liberal Catholics like Montalembert for being &quot;the only Catholics in Europe who sympathize with the loyal people of the Union.&quot; He posited that conscience must remain free to believe as it decides, and religion deals with the spiritual, not the civil realm. The State should protect such a right and restrict itself to governance of the external realm. He thus adopted a new form of liberalism that remained with him until his death, although his enthusiasm for such a liberalism must be balanced by a near simultaneous and unambiguous repudiation of liberalism which he expressed in the resuscitated &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; in 1873. There he rejected the kind of liberalism that makes &quot;this world and its interests supreme.&quot; In 1862, he was nominated for a Republican Congressional spot in third district of New Jersey, but was met with failure that was blamed on his open Catholic views.

In 1864, John Frémont, whom Brownson strongly supported, withdrew from the Presidential race. After these two defeats, Brownson’s declining health, spirit, and subscribers caused him to stop publishing the &quot;Review&quot; the same year. The journal was relaunched again later in Brownson&#x27;s life after a nearly ten-year hiatus, in 1873. The &quot;Review&quot; finally ceased publication in 1875, the year before Brownson&#x27;s death. In 1857, Brownson wrote a memoir, &quot;The Convert; or, Leaves from My Experience&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Brownson died on April 17, 1876, in Detroit, Michigan, aged 72. Originally, he was interned at Mt. Elliott Cemetery in Detroit. His remains were subsequently transferred to the crypt of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at the University of Notre Dame, where his personal papers are also archived.

==Legacy and criticism==

Response to Brownson&#x27;s views was mixed during his lifetime. He was invited to New Orleans in 1855 by the publication &quot;Le Propagateur&quot;, because he was viewed as a figure whom both Protestants and Catholics might enjoy hearing from, because of his multiple political and religious associations during his life. Although various newspapers recorded contradictory opinions on his lectures, all praised his &quot;eloquent&quot; speech.

In 1850s, among his many intellectual contributions, in the midst of Irish and German immigration debate and related nativist moral panic, Brownson introduced the term &quot;Americanization&quot; into the public discourse while delivering a lecture, &quot;Church and the Republic&quot;, at St. John’s College, future Fordham University. His attempts to harmonize ethnic immigrant identities with American democratic tradition without social and cultural homogenization are considered as an early move in the direction of multiculturalism. Brownson is often incorrectly credited with being the person to coin the term Odinism, referring to his 1848 &quot;Letter to Protestants&quot;.

Brownson was summed up by poet and critic James Russell Lowell in his satirical &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot; as someone trying to bite off more than he could chew: &quot;his mouth very full with attempting to gulp a Gregorian bull&quot;.

Edgar Allan Poe refers to Brownson in his &quot;Autography&quot; series, calling him &quot;an extraordinary man,&quot; though he &quot;has not altogether succeeded in convincing himself of those important truths which he is so anxious to impress upon his readers.&quot; He is also mentioned in Poe&#x27;s story &quot;Mesmeric Revelation,&quot; referring to Brownson&#x27;s 1840 novel &quot;Charles Eldwood; or, The Infidel Converted&quot;.

While reviewing Brownson&#x27;s biography penned by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Henry Steele Commager noted that: &quot;In his day Orestes Brownson was respected and feared as were few of his contemporaries; European philosophers regarded him with hope; American politicians enlisted his vitriolic pen; denominations competed for his eloquence; and when he listed himself among the three most profound men in America there were those who took him seriously.&quot; Peter J. Stanlis has pointed out that &quot;In the generation following the founding fathers of the American republic, Orestes Brownson, together with John C. Calhoun, was probably the most original and profound political thinker of the nineteenth century. Woodrow Wilson considered his most important book, &quot;The American Republic&quot; (1865), the best study of the American constitution.&quot;

Additionally, Brownson was held in high regard by many European intellectuals and theologians, including Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry, who called Brownson &quot;the keenest critic of the 19th century, an indomitable logician, a disinterested lover of truth, a sage, as sharp as Aristotle, as lofty as Plato.&quot; Lord Acton visited with Brownson and later wrote that &quot;Intellectually, no American I have met comes near him.&quot;

==Family==
Brownson&#x27;s brother, Oran, joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the same time Orestes became a Roman Catholic. One of Oran&#x27;s main reasons for joining the LDS Church was its belief in authority.

Two of Brownson&#x27;s sons served the Union as regular Army officers during the Civil War: Major Henry F. Brownson (1835–1913) and Captain Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Brownson (1843–1864). Edward was published during the war under pseudonyms. Brownson&#x27;s daughter Sarah Brownson (1839–1876) was an author and poet whose writings supported the war effort.

Henry published a three-volume biography of his father in 1900 and also edited his father&#x27;s collected works.

<text>Michael den Elzen (born 1962) is a musician and music producer based in Melbourne, Australia. He has performed for over 30 years with many well-known Australian and New Zealand artists, principally as a guitarist, and has contributed music for several Australian movie soundtracks.

==Early career==
Den Elzen spent his early life in Boort and Mansfield (Victoria) and started playing guitar at about 10 years of age. At the age of 15, he was performing in Melbourne with the band &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot;, who made it to the finals of the Channel 9 TV talent competition &quot;Safeway New Faces&quot;. He co-founded local bands &quot;Notorious Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;The U-Boats&quot;, and did recording studio session work. At age 19, he joined Broderick Smith for his first solo album and toured in his band for about three years. He went on to perform with Venetta Fields; with Tim Finn as a guitarist on his 1985 &quot;Big Canoe&quot; tour; and with Stephen Cummings on his &quot;This Wonderful Life&quot; album, and Australian and US tours.

In the mid 80s, den Elzen formed Melbourne band Schnell Fenster with ex-Split Enz members Phil Judd, Nigel Griggs and Noel Crombie. They released two albums, &quot;The Sound of Trees&quot; and &quot;OK Alright A Huh Oh Yeah&quot; and toured in Australia and New Zealand.

==1990s==
After the breakup of Schnell Fenster, den Elzen played on and co-produced Deborah Conway&#x27;s 1991 successful &quot;String of Pearls&quot; album. He went to America to perform for Peter Case on &quot;Six-Pack of Love&quot;. The band on the album includes producer and keyboardist Mitchell Froom, bassist Bruce Thomas (&quot;Elvis Costello and The Attractions&quot;) and drummer Gary Mallaber (&quot;Van Morrison&quot;, &quot;Steve Miller Band&quot;).

He recorded and toured as bass player and musical director with Tim Finn on Finn&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Before and After&quot;; and toured and recorded with Richard Pleasance; and then toured and recorded with Melbourne band Rebecca&#x27;s Empire for their &quot;Way of All Things&quot; album.

At the end of the 1990s, he joined Australian rock outfit Deadstar co-producing their final album &quot;Somewhere Over The Radio&quot;.

==Soundtracks==
Den Elzen started composing music for films in the 80s, the first being &quot;As The Mirror Burns&quot; (1990 release date). He worked with Phil Judd and Schnell Fenster on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Rikky and Pete&quot; (1988), and was also involved with Phil Judd on the soundtrack for &quot;The Big Steal&quot; (1990) and &quot;Mr. Reliable&quot; (1996). Three Schnell Fenster songs feature in the Jane Campion film &quot;Sweetie&quot; (1989).

He did the soundtrack to David Batty&#x27;s &quot;Rodeo Road&quot; (1999) which led to producing, recording, and co-writing the music for the TV series &quot;Bush Mechanics&quot; (2001) in Yuendumu about 300 km north-west of Alice Springs, and the soundtracks to other David Batty films, &quot;Sisters, Pearls and Mission Girls&quot; (2003) and &quot;Taylor Made&quot; (2003), as well as the TV series &quot;Inventions From The Shed&quot; (2005), all aired on the ABC.

Den Elzen also worked on a project with painter and artist David Munro called Birdbrain, whose music was used in the TV series &quot;The Secret Life of Us&quot; and in the film &quot;Ghosts of the Civil Dead&quot; (1988).
Other composer credits include &quot;Trespass&quot; (2001), &quot;Beyond Sorry&quot; (2004), &quot;Bush Bikes&quot; (2003), &quot;Us Mob&quot; (2005) and &quot;Aurukun-Voices From The Cape&quot; (2008) by David Vadiveloo, &quot;Case 442&quot; (2005) by C.A.A.M.A., &quot;Going Bush&quot; (2006) by SBS TV, &quot;Marree Man&quot; (2007), the series &quot;Halal Mate&quot; (2007) (for which he was nominated in the category of &quot;Best Music for a Documentary&quot; at the 2008 APRA-AGSC Screen Music Awards), &quot;That&#x27;s Australia&quot; (2007), &quot;Desert Heart&quot; (2007), &quot;Wedding Makers&quot; (2008), &quot;Coniston&quot; (2012), &quot;Kabelbel&quot; (2013), &quot;Black As&quot; series 1-4 (2016-2022) and &quot;Truck Hunters&quot; (2018-2020) (Ten Network) by Rebel Films, &quot;Artists at Work – David Frazer&quot; (2007), &quot;IOU – Lloyd Rees&quot; (2007) and &quot;Tom Moore – Glassorama&quot; (2008) by Tony Wyzenbeek at ABC TV, the SBS series &quot;Love&#x27;s Harvest&quot; (2007) by Brian McKenzie and Rebel Films, and &quot;God Is A Wandjina&quot; (2021) by Paul Bell (Feral Films) for &quot;Compass&quot; (ABC TV). Michael also collaborated with Justin Marshall on the soundtrack for the second series of &quot;The Art Life&quot; (2008) by Frank Haines Films, which aired on ABC TV.

==Other work==
He produced, recorded and played most instruments on &quot;Take Me to the Place&quot; by Tess McKenna after collaborating on a song for the film soundtrack to &quot;Curtains for My Cabin&quot; and played guitars on &quot;March&quot; also by Tess McKenna – year uncertain since dates are not given on the album, and on her 2019 release &quot;Before You Wandered In&quot; . He played guitar and recorded with David Bridie and has also written and performed with Renée Geyer, Mark Seymour and Pound System. Other artists Michael has recorded with include Zulya Kamalova (he is also accredited with mixing her album &quot;Tales of Subliming&quot;), Margaret Urlich, Diana Aniad, Bollywood Prog Metal band; BaK and Mimori Yusa (Japan). Michael also mixed tracks for Kim Salmon &amp; The Surrealists including &quot;I Won&#x27;t Tell&quot; from the album &quot;Ya Gotta Let Me Do My Thing&quot;, and has a musical credit on the film &quot;The Man Who Sued God&quot;.

Den Elzen has visited far north-western South Australia (Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara / APY Lands) over the years to record songs by local musicians promoting awareness of issues to do with health and well-being, supported by Nganampa Health Council in Alice Springs. The resulting CDs are called &quot;UPK2 Tilun Tilun Ta&quot; (2003), &quot;UPK3 Kunma Piti-la&quot; (2004), &quot;UPK4 Ulkiyala&quot; (2005) and &quot;UPK5 Katji Kuta-la&quot; (2011).

In 2017 he released the album &quot;Music For Listening And Relaxation&quot; with former band-mate Rebecca Barnard. An eclectic soundscape featuring Rebecca&#x27;s haunting vocals, Michael produced and co-wrote the songs, and played all the instruments apart from some acoustic guitar by Barnard.
Michael continues to work on film sound production. He is accredited with audio-post production and music composition on the SBS series &quot;Halal Mate&quot;, &quot;Kabelbel&quot;, &quot;Maree Man&quot;, &quot;Black As&quot;, &quot;Truck Hunters&quot; and audio-post production for &quot;Little J and Big Cuz&quot;. He is currently composing for another project.

<text>Schnell Fenster were a New Zealand rock band formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1986 by Noel Crombie on drums and percussion, Nigel Griggs on bass guitar and backing vocals, Phil Judd on lead vocals and guitar, and Eddie Rayner on keyboards and piano – who were all former members of New Zealand-formed rock group, Split Enz. Fellow founder, Michael den Elzen on lead guitar had worked with Tim Finn Band, another band formed by a Split Enz alumnus. Judd&#x27;s band were briefly named The Wanx: but Rayner soon left and they changed their name to faux-German for &quot;quick window&quot;, because it &quot;appealed to [their] perversity&quot;. The group formed the core members of Noel&#x27;s Cowards, a short-term ensemble, whose sole output was six tracks for the soundtrack of a feature film, &quot;Rikky and Pete&quot;, in 1988. Schnell Fenster released two studio albums, &quot;The Sound of Trees&quot; (1988) and &quot;Ok Alright a Huh Oh Yeah&quot; (1990), before disbanding in 1992. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989 they were nominated for Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;The Sound of Trees&quot;, Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Whisper&quot; and Best Cover Art for Judd&#x27;s graphic art.

== History ==
Schnell Fenster (&quot;schnelles Fenster&quot; is German for &quot;fast window&quot;) were formed in Melbourne as a pop, rock group in 1986 by Noel Crombie on drums and percussion (ex-Split Enz, the Slaughtermen), Michael den Elzen on lead guitar (ex-Broderick Smith Band, Tim Finn Band, Stephen Cummings Band), Nigel Griggs on bass guitar and backing vocals (ex-Octopus, Steve Hillage&#x27;s Khan [both in England], Split Enz), Phil Judd on lead vocals and guitar (ex-Split Enz, Suburban Reptiles, the Swingers) and Eddie Rayner on keyboards and piano (ex-Orb, Split Enz, Space Waltz). Rayner left soon after its formation to join the Rock Party and later was a touring member of Crowded House – another Split Enz-related group. The band&#x27;s name is from &quot;the nickname given to an experimental steam locomotive built in the 1930s. It reached incredible speeds but was declared unsafe.&quot;

Laurence Boswell of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; interviewed Crombie in August 1987; Boswell asserted, &quot;For me, Noel personified the intersection of music and art on the fringe. He was an essential ingredient of the Split Enz magic – in sound, performance and image. His percussion was
perfection, his spoon solos bedazzled, and those haircuts and clothes!&quot; For Crombie the group &quot;began as a kind of a hobby — &#x27;an enthusiasts&#x27; band&#x27;. As rehearsals developed the music into full-fledged songs, the decision was made to work towards recording an album. Live gigs will be a rarity until the album is released.&quot; He continued, &quot;after a year, we&#x27;re keen to get into a studio. We&#x27;ve got a lot of songs together and we&#x27;re keen to get them recorded.&quot;

In August 1987 Crombie indicated they were working on the soundtrack for a feature film, &quot;Rikky and Pete&quot; (1988). Rayner was &quot;working on the film as well, doing the underscore.&quot; (see The Makers) Noel&#x27;s Cowards, formed as a studio-only ensemble, consisted of the extant Schnell Fenster members, plus Wendy Matthews (vocals), Michael Harris (fiddle), Louis McManus (mandolin), Vika Bull and Lisa Edwards (backing vocals). They provided six &quot;country-tinged&quot; tracks for &quot;Rikky and Pete&quot; and the related single, &quot;Fingers Crossed&quot;, in 1988. Schnell Fenster&#x27;s track, &quot;Run a Mile&quot;, was also used on the soundtrack.

Schnell Fenster released their debut studio album, &quot;The Sound of Trees&quot;, in September 1988 via EMI Records/Warner Music Australasia for the Australasian market and Atlantic Records, internationally. The music was composed by all four members with lyrics written by Judd. They had signed with EMI in January of that year after, &quot;it became evident that actual songs were emerging from these [jam] sessions, the band started recording demo tapes.&quot; The album was co-produced by the group with English producers, Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, at Platinum Studios, Melbourne. It peaked in the ARIA top 100.

Another &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; reporter, Kathryn Whitfield opined that the album&#x27;s, &quot;music is bizarre, though not extraordinary. It is similar in parts to those weird wonders produced by the Cure. These off-beat ditties are all over the place like a dog&#x27;s dinner, with synthesised gurgles crashing about the seemingly opium-induced lyrics... coupled with the high-pitched whining vocals of Judd, it is more than one person should have to bear.&quot;

Boswell and Whitfield&#x27;s fellow journalist, Amanda Lynch, described the group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Whisper&quot; (August), which &quot;has a subtle Split Enz feel to it but in general, the music of Schnell Fenster is very different. It lacks the clarity and energetic enthusiasm that was the Split Enz trademark.&quot; &quot;Whisper&quot; peaked in top 60 in Australia and top 50 in New Zealand.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989 the group were nominated for Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;The Sound of Trees&quot;, Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Whisper&quot; and Best Cover Art for Judd&#x27;s graphic art. The album had provided two further singles, &quot;Love-Hate Relationship&quot; (late 1988) and &quot;This Illusion&quot; (1989). The band performed across Australia to promote their material and then toured New Zealand in 1989, as a support act for Crowded House. Renewed interest in Split Enz had led to an American album release later that year, but with no tour and little record company support, it did not chart there.

Schnell Fenster&#x27;s second album, &quot;Ok Alright a Huh Oh Yeah&quot;, was released in 1990. It was produced by the group and included Venetta Fields on backing vocals. They had recorded it at Metropolis Music and Effects Platinum, Atlanta. AllMusic&#x27;s Chris Woodstra observed, &quot;Though the songs aren&#x27;t quite as strong as those on the debut [album, it] is still a solid, well produced effort, worthwhile for longtime Split Enz fans.&quot; Crombie&#x27;s worsening tinnitus led to cessation of touring, and Schnell Fenster disbanded in 1992. Woodstra related how former members were, &quot;playing a more active role behind the scenes in the music business.&quot;

<doc id="904525" wikidata="Q1101303" url="?curid=904525" title="John Lanchbery">
<text>John Arthur Lanchbery OBE (15 May 1923 – 27 February 2003) was an English-Australian composer and conductor, famous for his ballet arrangements. He served as the Principal Conductor of the Royal Ballet from 1959 to 1972, Principal Conductor of the Australian Ballet from 1972 to 1977, and Musical Director of the American Ballet Theatre from 1978 to 1980. He continued to conduct regularly for the Royal Ballet until 2001.

Lanchbery was widely considered (including by Nureyev) to be the greatest ballet conductor of his time, and to be ‘a conductor and music director of unmatched experience’ who was ‘directly responsible for raising the status and the standards of musical performance&#x27;. Maina Gielgud, Artistic Director of Australian Ballet, stated that &quot;He [Lanchbery] is not only the finest conductor for dance of his generation and probably well beyond&quot;. One critic wrote that ‘the music was always on its best behaviour’ when Lanchbery was conducting. He was also famous for his re-adaptation of canonical works.

==Early life==

Lanchbery was born in London on 15 May 1923, where he began violin lessons and music composition when he was eight years of age. He was educated at Alleyn&#x27;s School, where he formed a collaborative partnership with Peter Stanley Lyons who was later a famous chorister, and with Kenneth Spring who was the founder of the National Youth Theatre and whose composer mother encouraged Lanchbery&#x27;s musical talent. Lanchbery was in 1942 awarded the Henry Smart Composition Scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied under Sir Henry Wood until his studies were interrupted by the war, during which he served in the Royal Armoured Corps, after which Lanchbery returned to the RAM to study for two more years before he returned to Alleyn&#x27;s School as a music master. He was declined the job of Alleyn&#x27;s School&#x27;s Director of Music, and subsequently worked for a music publisher.

==Musical career==
===Conductor of London Metropolitan Ballet and Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Ballet: 1948–1959===
Lanchbery was recommended to apply for the post of Conductor of the Metropolitan Ballet. He obtained the position and made his debut with them at Edinburgh in 1948. Two years later the orchestra collapsed for lack of funds. However, working with choreographer Celia Franca, Lanchbery wrote &quot;The Eve of St Agnes&quot; (the story was based on John Keats&#x27; poem of the same name), one of the first commissioned ballets to be shown on BBC television. He composed film scores for Eric Robinson before joining the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Ballet (later the Royal Ballet touring company) in 1951, with whom he proceeded to orchestrate, in 1953, the first professional ballet choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan: &quot;Somnambulism&quot; whose music was composed with music by Stan Kenton. Lanchbery also orchestrated &quot;The House of Birds&quot; (&quot;La Casa de los Pájaros&quot;) in 1955, with original music by Federico Mompou.

===Principal Conductor of Royal Ballet: 1959–1972===
Lanchbery served as Principal Conductor of the Royal Ballet from 1959 from 1972. He arranged the music for the ballet &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot;, to choreography by Frederick Ashton, for the Royal Ballet in 1960. The pastiche score for Ashton&#x27;s &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot; included music by Donizetti, Martini, Rossini, and Peter-Ludwig Hertel, as well as material composed by Lanchbery himself. The music for the famous &quot;Clog Dance&quot;, originally by Hertel, was used for many years as a theme tune for &quot;Home This Afternoon&quot; on BBC radio. In 1960 the dancer Rudolf Nureyev staged &quot;The Kingdom of the Shades&quot; scene from Marius Petipa&#x27;s ballet &quot;La Bayadère&quot; for the Royal Ballet, and Lanchbery was commissioned to create a new arrangement of Ludwig Minkus&#x27;s music. Eventually he would create a new version of the complete score.

In addition to the revenue from his recordings, Lanchbery had his income supplemented by the copyright he earned from his orchestral arrangements, which were used by ballet companies all over the world. With Ashton, he composed &quot;The Two Pigeons&quot;; &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;; &quot;The Dream&quot;; and one of the most critically acclaimed ballet versions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

In 1966 Rudolf Nureyev asked Lanchbery to reorchestrate Ludwig Minkus&#x27;s score for the ballet &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

Although he resigned from the position of Director of the Royal Ballet in 1972, he continued to conduct regularly for the company until 2001.

===Principal Conductor of Australian Ballet: 1972–1977===
Notable successes for Lanchbery included the arrangement of the Liszt music for Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s stormy multi-act Mayerling, which premiered at Covent Garden in 1978, and the arrangement of the Franz Lehár score for the first full-length ballet production of The Merry Widow for the Australian Ballet in 1976.
In 1971, he composed the music for the ballet film &quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot;. His sources were many and varied, including the operas of Michael William Balfe and Arthur Sullivan. He also arranged the music and conducted the orchestra for &quot;Nijinsky&quot; in 1980.

Lanchbery was the first to convert operas into ballets (&quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;), and he also wrote music for some British films of the 1950s, including &quot;Deadly Nightshade&quot; (1953) and &quot;Colonel March Investigates&quot; (1955). He was involved in &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977), starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne, and his score for &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1982) was based on songs by Cole Porter, a memorable rendition of &quot;You&#x27;re The Top&quot; by Diana Rigg. He also wrote scores for two silent film classics: D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Horse&quot;.

===Director of American Ballet Theatre: 1978–1980===
The American Ballet Theatre used 14 Lanchbery arrangements between 1962 and 2002: he was the Musical Director of the Company between 1978 and 2002. Their productions included his arrangement, for Natalia Makarova, Minkus&#x27;s &quot;La Bayadère&quot; in 1980. Lanchbery arranged more than 30 pieces by Franz Liszt for Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Mayerling&quot;, which premiered at Covent Garden in 1978. Nureyev staged the full-length &quot;La Bayadère&quot; for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1992, which proved to be his final production before his death. Minkus&#x27;s score was presented in its original orchestration for Nureyev&#x27;s version, the parts having been obtained from the Mariinsky Theatre&#x27;s library by Nureyev himself. Nureyev photo copied the score himself, which were poorly done with entire parts of the pages cut off. This required Nureyev to call upon Lanchbery to fix the passages of the score that were missing, but always staying true to Minkus&#x27;s original intentions. Nureyev considered Lanchbery to be the greatest ballet conductor of his time.

==Visiting conductor==

In addition to London, Australia, and Sweden, Lanchbery was a guest conductor at many of the world&#x27;s leading opera houses, including Paris, Stockholm, Rio de Janeiro, New York and Houston. He also toured Japan, Russia and China. He received honours from Russia and Sweden.

==Honours==
Lanchbery was the first non-Soviet conductor to receive the Bolshoi Medal. He also received the Carina Ari Medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award, Britain&#x27;s highest professional award. In 1990 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

==Personal life==
Lanchbery married a Sadler&#x27;s Wells principal Elaine Fifield in 1951. They had a daughter, Margaret Lanchbery, and divorced in 1960: Elaine died in 1999. Lanchbery became an Australian citizen in 2002, making his home in Melbourne, where he died on 27 February 2003. He was survived by his daughter, Margaret, of Melbourne, and his companion, Thomas Han.

He was a member of the Garrick Club.

==Works==

Some of the most popular ballets are arrangements of works written for a different purpose. Perhaps the best-known is Alexander Glazunov&#x27;s arrangement of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s piano music into the ballet &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;. Another famous example is &quot;La boutique fantasque&quot;, an arrangement of Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s music by Ottorino Respighi in 1919. However, Lanchbery was the most successful and prolific arranger of music for ballet.

<text>LPMud, abbreviated LP, is a family of multi-user dungeon (MUD) server software. Its first instance, the original LPMud game driver, was developed in 1989 by Lars Pensjö (the LP in LPMud). LPMud was innovative in its separation of the MUD infrastructure into a virtual machine (termed the &quot;driver&quot;) and a development framework written in the programming language LPC (termed the &quot;mudlib&quot;).

==Development==
Lars Pensjö had been an avid player of TinyMUD and AberMUD. He had wanted to create a world with the flexibility of TinyMUD and the style of AberMUD but did not want to have sole responsibility for creating and maintaining the game world. He once said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to design a good adventure. By allowing wizards coding rights, I thought others could help me with this.&quot; The result was the creation of a new, C-based, object-oriented programming language, LPC, that made it simple for people with minimal programming skills to add elements like rooms, weapons, and monsters to a virtual world.

To accomplish his goal, Lennart Augustsson convinced Pensjö to write what today would be called a virtual machine, the LPMud driver. The driver managed the interpretation of LPC code as well as providing basic operating system services to the LPC code. By virtue of this design, Pensjö made it more difficult for common programming errors like infinite loops and infinite recursion made by content builders to harm the overall stability of the server. His choice of an OO approach made it easy for new programmers to concentrate on the task of &quot;building a room&quot; rather than programming logic.

Pensjö created &quot;Genesis&quot; in April 1989 as the first implementation of the LPC language, and therefore the first LPMud, in which the developer (commonly known as a wizard within the MUD) could code their own objects.

Pensjö&#x27;s work has been extended or reverse engineered in a number of projects:
* LPMud 3.2, better known as the Amylaar driver, after its lead developer, Jörn &quot;Amylaar&quot; Rennecke
* MudOS
* DGD, Dworkin&#x27;s Game Driver, a conceptual rather than code derivative of LPMud developed by Felix &quot;Dworkin&quot; Croes
* SWLPC, Shattered World&#x27;s fork of LPMud 2.4.5

Though an LPMud server can be used to implement nearly any style of game, LPMuds are often thought of as having certain common characteristics as a genre, such as a mixture of hack and slash with role-playing, quests as an element of advancement, and &quot;guilds&quot; as an alternative to character classes.

==LPMud talkers==
LPMud was used as the basis for the first Internet talker, &quot;Cat Chat&quot;, which opened in 1990.

==TMI Mudlib==
The TMI Mudlib from The Mud Institute was an attempt to create a framework driven mudlib for the MudOS LPMud driver. It consisted of many contributors to MudOS as well as people who became influential in the LPMud community. When TMI began work in 1992, a mudlib was generally packaged with both an LPMud driver and a complete world built on top of the mudlib. As a framework-driven mudlib, the goal of the TMI mudlib was to provide only examples for world objects and place the burden of building a working world on the game developers using TMI.

TMI implemented the first InterMUD communications network, when MudOS added network socket support in 1992.

In 1992, MIRE, a multi-user information system producing customised newspapers was built based on a modified TMI driver.

In 1993, the TMI-2 mudlib was used to create &quot;PangaeaMud&quot;, an academic research project designed as an interactive geologic database tool.

Notable MUDs based on TMI-derived mudlibs include &quot;The Two Towers&quot; set in Tolkien’s universe and &quot;Threshold&quot;.

== Server software ==
MudOS is a major family of LPMud server software, implementing its own variant of the LPC (programming language). It first came into being on February 18, 1992. It pioneered important technical innovations in MUDs, including the network socket support that made InterMUD communications possible and LPC-to-C compilation.

FluffOS started as a collection of patches of last unreleased version of MudOS, FluffOS has evolved into an independent and enhanced project, providing a powerful platform for crafting interactive and immersive virtual worlds, it is the best choice of running LPMUD lib now, as well as creating new ones. For more information, you can visit the main website at FluffOS Official Website at.

&quot;Genocide&quot; was an important development testbed for MudOS from 1992 to 1994, but switched back to the main LPMud branch, citing speed concerns.

<doc id="904531" wikidata="Q2156836" url="?curid=904531" title="Robert Dale Owen">
<text>Robert Dale Owen (7 November 1801 – 24 June 1877) was a Scottish-born Welsh-American social reformer who was active in Indiana politics as member of the Democratic Party in the Indiana House of Representatives (1835–39 and 1851–53) and represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives (1843–47). As a member of Congress, Owen successfully pushed through the bill that established the Smithsonian Institution and served on the Institution&#x27;s first Board of Regents. Owen also served as a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850 and was appointed as U.S. &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; (1853–58) to Naples.

Owen was a knowledgeable exponent of the socialist doctrines of his father, Robert Owen, and managed the day-to-day operation of New Harmony, Indiana, the socialistic utopian community he helped establish with his father in 1825. Throughout his adult life, Robert Dale Owen wrote and published numerous pamphlets, speeches, books, and articles that described his personal and political views, including his belief in spiritualism. Owen co-edited the &quot;New-Harmony Gazette&quot; with Frances Wright in the late 1820s in Indiana and the &quot;Free Enquirer&quot; in the 1830s in New York City. Owen was an advocate of married women&#x27;s property and divorce rights, and secured inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools and established the position of Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. Owen is also noted for a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 that favored the abolition of slavery and supported general emancipation, as well as a suggestion that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen.

==Early life and education==
Robert Dale Owen was born on 7 November 1801, in Glasgow, Scotland, to Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale and Robert Owen. His mother was the daughter of David Dale, a Scottish textile manufacturer; his Welsh-born father became part-owner and manager of the New Lanark Mills, his father-in-law&#x27;s textile mill at New Lanark, Scotland. Robert Dale was the eldest surviving son of eight children; his younger siblings (three brothers and three sister) were William, Ann (or Anne) Caroline, Jane Dale, David Dale, Richard Dale, and Mary.

Owen grew up in Braxfield, Scotland, and was privately tutored before he was sent at the age of sixteen to Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg&#x27;s school at Hofwyl, Switzerland. The Swiss school exposed Owen to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi&#x27;s method of education. After completing his formal education, Owen returned to Scotland to join his father in the textile business at New Lanark.

Owen&#x27;s father, a successful textile manufacturer and philanthropist, became a noted socialist reformer whose vision of social equality included, among other projects, the establishment of experimental utopian communities in the United States and the United Kingdom. Robert Dale Owen, who shared many of his father&#x27;s views on social issues immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and helped his father manage the socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana. Owen&#x27;s three surviving brothers (William, David, and Richard) and his sister, Jane, also immigrated to the United States and became residents of New Harmony.

==Early career==
Between 1825 and 1828, Owen managed the day-to-day operations of the socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana, while his father returned to Britain to resume his social reform and philanthropic work in Europe. In addition to his other work, Owen and Frances Wright, a wealthy, Scottish philanthropist and radical reformer, published articles in the &quot;New-Harmony Gazette&quot;, the town&#x27;s liberal weekly newspaper, and served as its co-editors. Established in 1825, the &quot;Gazette&quot; was one of Indiana&#x27;s earliest newspapers; however, it ceased publications in February 1829.

After the New Harmony utopian community dissolved in 1827, Owen traveled in Europe before returning to the United States in 1829. During this period Owen wrote &quot;Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question&quot; (1830), a controversial pamphlet on the topic of population control. It was one of the first books in the United States to advocate birth control, along with Dr. Charles Knowlton&#x27;s &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot;. Knowlton and Owen were contemporaries and apparently knew each other. Content from Knowlton&#x27;s book appears in Owen&#x27;s, and the second edition of Knowlton&#x27;s book includes some of Owen&#x27;s content.

Owen moved to New York City, where he and Wright co-edited the weekly &quot;Free Enquirer&quot; until 1831–32. As they had done in the &quot;New Harmony Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Free Enquirer&quot; continued to express their radical views on a variety of subjects, including abolition of slavery, women&#x27;s rights, universal suffrage, free public education, birth control, and religion. Owen returned to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1833, after he and Wright discontinued their editorship of the New York newspaper.

==Marriage and family==
Owen and Mary Jane Robinson were married before a justice of the peace on 12 April 1832, in New York City. After an extended trip to Europe, they relocated to New Harmony, Indiana. The couple had six children, two of whom died at an early age. Their surviving children were Florence (b. 1836), Julian Dale (b. 1837), Ernest (b. 1838), and Rosamond (b. 1843).

On June 23, 1876, five years after the death of his first wife, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York; he died a year later.

==Politician and statesman==
===Working Men&#x27;s Party leader===
During 1829–30, Owen became an active leader in the Working Men&#x27;s Party in New York City. In contrast to Democratic Presidents Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, Owen was opposed to slavery, although his partisanship distanced him from other leading abolitionists of the era.

===Indiana legislator===
After Owen&#x27;s return to New Harmony, Indiana in 1833, he became active in state politics. Owen served in the Indiana House of Representatives (1835–38; 1851–53). He distinguished himself as an influential member of the Indiana General Assembly during his first term by securing appropriations for the state&#x27;s tax-supported public school system. In addition, Owen was instrumental in introducing legislation and argued in support of widows and married women&#x27;s property rights, but the bill was defeated. He also proposed laws granting women greater freedom of divorce.

In addition to serving in the state legislature, Owen was elected as a delegate from Posey County, Indiana, to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850. At the convention, Owen initiated a proposal to include provisions for women&#x27;s property rights in the state constitution. Although it was not approved, this early effort to protect women&#x27;s rights led to later laws that were passed to secure women&#x27;s property, divorce, and voting rights. One of Owen&#x27;s lasting legacies was his authorship and efforts to secure the inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided state funding for a uniform system of common schools that are free and open to all and established the office of the state&#x27;s superintendent of public instruction.

===U.S. Congressman===
After his first term in the Indiana legislature and two unsuccessful campaigns for election to the U.S. Congress in 1838 and in 1840, Owen was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1842. He served from 1843 to 1847 in the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses. Owen was chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals during the Twenty-eighth Congress. He was also involved in the debates about the annexation of Texas and an Oregon boundary dispute in 1844 that led to the establishment of the U.S-British boundary at the 49th parallel north, the result of the Oregon Treaty (1846).

While serving as a member of Congress, Owen introduced and helped to secure passage of the bill that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. Owen was appointed to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s first Board of Regents and chaired its Building Committee, which oversaw the construction of the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C., and recommended James Renwick Jr. as architect, James Dixson and Gilbert Cameron as the contractors, and the Seneca Quarry for its distinct, dark-red sandstone.

Owen, his brother David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, were involved in developing preliminary plans for the Smithsonian Building. These early plans influenced Renwick&#x27;s choice of the Romanesque Revival architectural style (sometimes referred to as Norman-style architecture) and his three-story design for the building, which was finally selected, although not without controversy. Owen&#x27;s book &quot;Hints on Public Architecture&quot; (1849) argued the case for the suitability of Renwick&#x27;s Romanesque Revival (Norman) architectural style for public buildings such as the Smithsonian &quot;Castle,&quot; which he discussed in detail. Seven full-page illustrations and details of the building&#x27;s architectural elements were prominently featured in the book, leading some to criticize Owen for his bias toward Renwick and his preference for Norman-style architecture over other popular styles.

===U.S. diplomat===
Owen was defeated in his bid for re-election to Congress in 1846; however, he remained active in public service and was once again elected to serve in the Indiana General Assembly. On 24 May 1853, while Owen was serving as a state legislator in Indiana, President Franklin Pierce appointed him as U.S. minister (&quot;Chargé d&#x27;Affaires&quot; and Minister Resident) to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at Naples. Owen served in the diplomatic post until 20 September 1858, and then retired from political life, although he remained actively interested in public affairs and social reform issues.

===Other political activities===
During the American Civil War, Owen served in the Ordnance Commission to supply the Union Army; on 16 March 1863, he was appointed to the Freedman&#x27;s Inquiry Commission. The commission was a predecessor to the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau.

In 1862 Owen wrote a series of open letters to U.S. government officials, including President Abraham Lincoln and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, to encourage them to support general emancipation. Owen&#x27;s letter of 23 July 1862, was published in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; on 8 August 1862, and his letter of 12 September 1862, was published in the same newspaper on 22 September 1862. In another open letter that Owen wrote to President Lincoln on 17 September 1862, he urged the president to abolish slavery on moral grounds. Owen also believed that emancipation would weaken the Confederate forces and help the Union army win the war. On 23 September 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary version of the Emancipation Proclamation (as he had first resolved to do in mid-July). In &quot;Emancipation is Peace&quot;, a pamphlet that Owen wrote in 1863, he confirmed his view that general emancipation was a means to end the war. In &quot;The Wrong of Slavery, the Right of Emancipation, and the Future of the African Race in the United States&quot;, a report that Owen wrote in 1864, he also suggested that the Union should provide assistance to freedmen.

Toward the end of his political career, Owen continued his effort to obtain federal voting rights for women. In 1865 he submitted an initial draft for a proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would not restrict voting rights to males. However, Article XIV, Section 2, in the final version of the Amendment, which became part of the U.S. Constitution in 1868, was modified to limit suffrage to males who were U.S. citizens over the age of twenty-one.

==Spiritualism==
In &quot;The authenticity of the Bible&quot; (1833), Owen remarked :

For a &quot;century and a half&quot;, then, after Jesus&#x27; death, we have no means whatever of substantiating even the existence of the Gospels, as now bound up in the New Testament. There is a perfect blank of 140 years; and a most serious one it is.

Like his father, Owen converted to Spiritualism and was the author of two books on the subject: &quot;Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World&quot; (1859) and &quot;The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next&quot; (1872).

==Later years==
Although he retired from active public service at the conclusion of his work as a member of the Freedman&#x27;s commission on 15 May 1864, Owen continued his writing career. Major writing projects in retirement included &quot;Beyond the Breakers&quot; (1870), a novel; &quot;The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next&quot; (1871), one of his two books on spiritualism; and &quot;Threading My Way&quot; (1874), his autobiography. Owen also wrote several articles that were published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;.

In 1875 Owen suffered a mental breakdown that was severe enough for him to be hospitalized at the Indiana Hospital for the Insane in Indianapolis, where he underwent three months of treatment. Owen recovered from the illness, was released from the hospital, and resumed writing. On 23 June 1876, a year before his death, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York.

==Death and legacy==
On 24 June 1877, Owen died at his summer home at Crosbyville on Lake George, New York. Initially he was buried in the town of Lake George in Warren County, New York. Later, his remains were exhumed and interred at New Harmony, Indiana, beside his first wife, Mary Jane Owen.

One of Owen&#x27;s most significant legacies in Indiana was to secure the inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools and established the position of Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. His early efforts to protect women&#x27;s rights were another of his political legacies. Although he was unsuccessful in adding provisions to protect women&#x27;s rights to Indiana&#x27;s state constitution of 1851, his efforts paved the way for others to follow. Eventually, Indiana laws granted women&#x27;s property and voting rights, as well as greater freedom in divorce.

As a U.S. Congressman, Owen introduced federal legislation that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. He was also a member of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s first Board of Regents and its Building Committee. His vision for the Smithsonian Institution Building, along with the preliminary plans and suggestions made by his brother, David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, influenced architect James Renwick Jr.&#x27;s design for the Romanesque Revival-style building in Washington, D.C.

Owen&#x27;s impact on the issues of slavery and emancipation is less direct. In a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 and in publications that followed, Owen encouraged the abolition of slavery on moral grounds, supported general emancipation, and suggested that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen. Some historians have concluded that these open letters and Civil War-era pamphlets &quot;helped immeasurably to solidify public opinion&quot; in favor of emancipation.

==Honors and tributes==
The town of Dale, Indiana, was named in Owen&#x27;s honor.

In 1911, the women of Indiana dedicated a memorial to Owen on the grounds of the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis that included a bronze bust of the statesman created by New Castle, Indiana native Frances Goodwin. The bust of Owen disappeared in the early 1970s; only its pedestal remains.

==Selected published works==

<doc id="904536" wikidata="Q1196897" url="?curid=904536" title="Kumaso">
<text>The were a mythical people of ancient Japan mentioned in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, believed to have lived in the south of Kyūshū until at least the Nara period. The last leader of the Kumaso, Torishi-Kaya was killed by Yamato Takeru in 397. The name of Kumamoto Prefecture originates from the Kumaso people. 

== Hypothesized Origin ==
Scholars, such as Kakubayashi Fumio, &quot;although information is extremely limited&quot; concluded that they were of Austronesian origin based on some linguistic and cultural evidence, theorising that the word &quot;kaya&quot;, present in personal names or titles, such as Torishi-Kaya, has the same root as Tagalog &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;ability; capability; competence; resources; wealth&quot; and Malay and Indonesian &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;rich, wealthy, having wealth&quot;. The &quot;So&quot; present in Kumaso was also theorised to have the same origins as &quot;tsuo, tsau, thau, sau, tau, &quot; supposedly meaning &quot;people&quot; in Austronesian languages. Alexander Vovin defended that the question of whether the Kumaso language was not Japonic is moot because not a single word of it is attested. Him and Mark Hudson also theorised there is a probability that the Kumaso and the Hayato represented the same ethnic group.

== Overview ==
William George Aston, in his translation of the &quot;Nihongi&quot;, says &quot;Kumaso&quot; refers to two separate tribes, &quot;Kuma&quot; (meaning &quot;bear&quot;) and &quot;So&quot; (written with the character for &quot;attack&quot; or &quot;layer on&quot;). In his translation of the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, Basil Hall Chamberlain records that the region is also known simply as &quot;So district&quot;, and elaborates on the Yamato-centric description of a &quot;bear-like&quot; people, based on their violent interactions or physical distinctiveness. (The people called &quot;tsuchigumo&quot; by the Yamato people provide a better-known example of the transformation of other tribes into legendary monsters. &quot;Tsuchigumo&quot;—the monstrous &quot;ground spider&quot; of legend—is speculated to refer originally to the native pit dwellings of that people.) 

Geographically, Aston records that the Kumaso domain encompassed the historical provinces of Hyūga, Ōsumi, and Satsuma (contemporaneous with Aston&#x27;s translation), or present-day Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures.

The last leader of the Kumaso, Torishi-Kaya, aka Brave of Kahakami, was assassinated in the winter of 397 by Prince Yamato Takeru of Yamato, who was disguised for this as a woman at a banquet.

== Legacy ==
The word Kuma (&#x27;Bear&#x27;) survives today as Kumamoto Prefecture (&#x27;source of the bear&#x27;), and Kuma District, Kumamoto. Kuma District is known for a distinct dialect, Kuma Dialect.

==People of the Kumaso mentioned in the Nihongi==
*Torishi-Kaya (aka Brave of Kahakami): a leader of the Kumaso
*Atsukaya: a leader of the Kumaso
*Sakaya: a leader of the Kumaso
*Ichi-fukaya: Emperor Keikō married her 82 AD and in the same year put her to death, since she was involved in the assassination which killed her father.
*Ichi-kaya: younger sister of Ichi-fukaya

<text>Bapsi Sidhwa (; 11 August 1938 – 25 December 2024) was a Pakistani novelist who wrote in English and was resident in the United States.

Sidhwa was best known for her collaborative work with Indo-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta: Sidhwa wrote both the 1991 novel &quot;Ice Candy Man&quot; which served as the basis for Mehta&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Earth&quot; as well as the 2006 novel &quot;Water: A Novel&quot;, on which Mehta&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Water&quot; is based&quot;.&quot; A documentary about Sidhwa&#x27;s life called &quot;Bapsi: Silences of My Life&quot; was released on the official YouTube channel of &quot; The Citizens Archive of Pakistan&quot; on 28 October 2022 with the title &quot; First Generation -Stories of partition: Bapsi Sidhwa&quot;.

==Background==
Sidhwa was born to Parsi Zoroastrian parents Peshotan and Tehmina Bhandara in Karachi, Bombay Presidency. She is of Gujarati Parsi Zoroastrian descent.

Roughly three months after her birth, she moved with her family to Lahore, Punjab Province. She was two years old when she contracted polio, requiring severe surgeries as a young child and leaving an impact throughout her life.

Sidhwa grew up having to live through distressing events during Partition, producing experiences that would shape her writing in the future. For example, a young Sidhwa was walking with her gardener a few months before Partition when they came across a gunny sack, which hid a young man&#x27;s corpse inside. This experience in particular is mirrored in her novel &quot;Cracking India,&quot; in addition to showing up in Mehta&#x27;s &quot;Earth.&quot; Sidhwa uses her experiences living through Partition as a background for the novel and creating the main character, Lenny.

Sidhwa received her BA from Kinnaird College for Women University in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1957. Shortly after graduating, she got married at the age of 19 and moved to Bombay, a change in scenery which she recalls as an initial shock which became easier to handle once she was able to engage with a community of other Zoroastrians. Sidhwa had a daughter and a son, though her marriage ended after five years, and she moved back to Lahore. Her son remained in Mumbai with his father&#x27;s family, and Sidhwa was unable to see him for many years due to heightened border restrictions.

Sidhwa eventually remarried in Lahore to her husband, Noshir, who is also a Zoroastrian. She had three more children and began her career as an author. One of her children is Mohur Sidhwa, who is a candidate for state representative in Arizona.

She was residing in Houston in the US. She described herself as a &quot;Punjabi-Parsi&quot;. Her first language was Gujarati, her second language was Urdu, and her third language was English. She could read and write best in English, but she was more comfortable talking in Gujarati or Urdu and often translated literally from Gujarati or Urdu to English.

Sidhwa died in Houston, Texas on 25 December 2024, at the age of 86.

==Teaching==
After attending a fellowship at Harvard University, Sidhwa started her first teaching job at Columbia University. Teaching writing to graduate students, Sidhwa initially experienced difficulty in teaching due to lack of experience, frequently experiencing panic attacks before her lectures.

Sidhwa left Columbia after one academic term and started living in Houston, teaching at the University of St. Thomas before eventually teaching at Rice University&#x27;s School of Continuing Studies. Sidhwa also taught at the University of Houston, Mount Holyoke College, and Brandeis University.

<text>Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre Headley Court (abbreviated to DMRC Headley Court, and more commonly known as Headley Court), formerly RAF Headley Court, was an United Kingdom Ministry of Defence facility in Headley, near Epsom, Surrey, England. The site was sold by the MoD in 2018, upon purchase of Stanford Hall, and its conversion to the Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre.

It was used as a rehabilitation centre for injured members of the British Armed Forces between 1985 and 2018.

==History and overview==
Headley Court was an Elizabethan farm house bought by the Cunliffe family, from Tyrrell&#x27;s Wood, Leatherhead. They later sold this farm house and built in 1899 the imposing mansion at the centre of Headley Court to the north, namely under Lord Cunliffe, who was Chairman of the Bank of England. Its architect was Edward Warren. During World War II, it was used as the Headquarters for the VII Corps and then for the Canadian Corps. During the war, nearby Headley Heath was used as a training ground for engineers building airstrips and trench systems then demolishing them again.

It was purchased after that war with money from the Royal Air Force Pilots and Crews Fund, a public collection as a tribute to the deeds, including the Battle of Britain efforts of the RAF. Since the war and until 2019, it was used as a Royal Air Force and Joint Services medical rehabilitation centre. which aimed to return all those service personnel injured or seriously ill to full fitness.

In November 2005, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the centre. They met Major David Bradley of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment who had been given a five per cent chance of survival, after coming under fire from a Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher (RPG) in Basra, southern Iraq in 2004. Other notable patients in 2006/2007 include Sgt Mark Sutcliffe, The Royal Anglian Regiment, Sgt Stuart Pearson, 3 PARA and many others.

In July 2014, the Minister of Defence, Philip Hammond, announced that the services provided by Headley Court would be transferred to a new centre to be developed at Stanford Hall. The opening of the new Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre by the Duke of Cambridge took place in June 2018. The centre at Headley Court ceased operations in September 2018 and the site was bought by Angle Property in May 2019. The plan was to redevelop the site including substantial new housing replacing many of the existing ancillary buildings.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the site was offered to the National Health Service and on 4 May 2020 it was re-opened as the NHS Seacole Centre (in tribute to Mary Seacole and the BAME contribution to the NHS), aimed at treatment of non-critical COVID-19 patients and rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients.

In 2024, work started to demolish all the more recent buildings, retaining the listed Mansion House, which will be the centre of a Retirement Community owned and operated by Audley.

==Facilities==

Rehabilitation staff averaged around 200 per year from all three services&#x27; medical and nursing branches, the longest established here being Princess Mary&#x27;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service. These comprised specialist medical officers, nurses, remedial instructors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, a cognitive therapist, social workers, engineers, and administration support staff. Not only did the centre deal with patients with new physical disabilities but it also dealt with patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The rehabilitation areas of the unit consisted of hydrotherapy pools, gymnasiums, and workshops for prosthetics. The high, wooded countryside setting and grounds of the unit were welcomed by staff and those recovering; Headley Heath and the North Downs Way share the escarpment and there is a high concentration of woodland wildlife. The 28 bed Peter Long Ward had single showers and nursing staff on call 24 hours a day, internet access and a kitchen area with washing and drying facilities for clothing. A further large ward opened in September 2010 of 30 beds, rest areas and equipment. Headley Court was in need of further facilities, particularly a full size swimming pool, as patients had to share a leisure centre in Leatherhead. The charity Help for Heroes was set up in late 2007, with a first objective of raising money to build these facilities.

<text>Scleractinia, also called stony corals or hard corals, are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that build themselves a hard skeleton. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc in which a mouth is fringed with tentacles. Although some species are solitary, most are colonial. The founding polyp settles and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body. Solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter. These polyps reproduce asexually by budding, but remain attached to each other, forming a multi-polyp colony of clones with a common skeleton, which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species.

The shape and appearance of each coral colony depends not only on the species, but also on its location, depth, the amount of water movement and other factors. Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues. These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains. Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones, and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes. Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton, but a few species brood their eggs. Asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation, when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere.

Stony corals occur in all the world&#x27;s oceans. Much of the framework of modern coral reefs is formed by scleractinians. Reef-building or hermatypic corals are mostly colonial; most of these are zooxanthellate and are found in the shallow waters into which sunlight penetrates. Other corals that do not form reefs may be solitary or colonial; some of these occur at abyssal depths where no light reaches.

Stony corals first appeared in the Middle Triassic, but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose corals of the Paleozoic is currently unresolved. In modern times stony corals numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.

== Anatomy ==

Scleractinian corals may be solitary or colonial. Colonies can reach considerable size, consisting of a large number of individual polyps.

=== Soft parts ===
Stony corals are members of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the polyp secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre of the oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls. The polyp is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like retractor muscles.

The polyps are connected by horizontal sheets of tissue known as coenosarc extending over the outer surface of the skeleton and completely covering it. These sheets are continuous with the body wall of the polyps, and include extensions of the gastrovascular cavity, so that food and water can circulate between all the different members of the colony.
In colonial species, the repeated asexual division of the polyps causes the corallites to be interconnected, thus forming the colonies. Also, cases exist in which the adjacent colonies of the same species form a single colony by fusing. Most colonial species have very small polyps, ranging from in diameter, although some solitary species may be as large as .

=== Skeleton ===

The skeleton of an individual scleractinian polyp is known as a corallite. It is secreted by the epidermis of the lower part of the body, and initially forms a cup surrounding this part of the polyp. The interior of the cup contains radially aligned plates, or septa, projecting upwards from the base. Each of these plates is flanked by a pair of mesenteries.

The septa are secreted by the mesenteries, and are therefore added in the same order as the mesenteries are. As a result, septa of different ages are adjacent to one another, and the symmetry of the scleractinian skeleton is radial or biradial. This pattern of septal insertion is termed &quot;cyclic&quot; by paleontologists. By contrast, in some fossil corals, adjacent septa lie in order of increasing age, a pattern termed serial and produces a bilateral symmetry. Scleractinians secrete a stony exoskeleton in which the septa are inserted between the mesenteries in multiples of six.

All modern scleractinian skeletons are composed of calcium carbonate in the form of crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (&quot;Coelosimilia&quot;) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid as is the case in the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.

=== Growth ===
In colonial corals, growth results from the budding of new polyps. There are two types of budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp develops on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, as is the case in the meandroid corallites of brain corals.

Extratentacular budding always results in separate polyps, each with its own corallite wall. In the case of bushy corals such as &quot;Acropora&quot;, lateral budding from axial polyps form the basis of the trunk and branches. The rate at which a stony coral colony lays down calcium carbonate depends on the species, but some of the branching species can increase in height or length by around a year (about the same rate as human hair grows). Other corals, like the dome and plate species, are more bulky and may only grow per year. The rate of aragonite deposition varies diurnally and seasonally. Examination of cross sections of coral can show bands of deposition indicating annual growth. Like tree rings, these can be used to estimate the age of the coral.

Solitary corals do not bud. They gradually increase in size as they deposit more calcium carbonate and produce new whorls of septa. A large &quot;Ctenactis echinata&quot; for example normally has a single mouth, may be about long and have more than a thousand septa.

== Distribution ==
Stony corals occur in all the world&#x27;s oceans. There are two main ecological groups. Hermatypic corals are mostly colonial corals which tend to live in clear, oligotrophic, shallow tropical waters; they are the world&#x27;s primary reef-builders. Ahermatypic corals are either colonial or solitary and are found in all regions of the ocean and do not build reefs. Some live in tropical waters but some inhabit temperate seas, polar waters, or live at great depths, from the photic zone down to about .

== Ecology ==

Scleractinians fall into one of two main categories:
* Reef-forming or hermatypic corals, which mostly contain zooxanthellae;
* Non-reef-forming or ahermatypic corals, which mostly do not contain zooxanthellae

In reef-forming corals, the endodermal cells are usually replete with symbiotic unicellular dinoflagellates known as zooxanthellae. There are sometimes as many as five million cells of these per of coral tissue. Up to 50% of organic compounds produced by symbionts are used as food by polyps. The oxygen byproduct of photosynthesis and the additional energy derived from sugars produced by zooxanthellae enable these corals to grow at a rate up to three times faster than similar species without symbionts. These corals typically grow in shallow, well-lit, warm water with moderate to brisk turbulence and abundant oxygen, and prefer firm, non-muddy surfaces on which to settle.

Most stony corals extend their tentacles to feed on zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take correspondingly larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many stony corals also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few stony corals, this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being &quot;Acropora acuminata&quot;. Caribbean stony corals are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthellae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.

Non-zooxanthellate corals are usually not reef-formers; they can be found most abundantly beneath about of water. They thrive at much colder temperatures and can live in total darkness, deriving their energy from the capture of plankton and suspended organic particles. The growth rates of most species of non-zooxanthellate corals are significantly slower than those of their counterparts, and the typical structure for these corals is less calcified and more susceptible to mechanical damage than that of zooxanthellate corals.

Scleratinians were previously believed to be obligatory hosts of another group of barnacles, the pyrgomatids, but a recent study recorded evidence of living pyrgomatids in stylasterids, casting doubt on this idea.

== Life cycle ==
Stony corals have a great range of reproductive strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having both male and female gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.

=== Asexual reproduction ===

The most common means of asexual reproduction in colonial stony corals is by fragmentation. Pieces of branching corals may get detached during storms, by strong water movement or by mechanical means, and fragments fall to the sea bed. In suitable conditions, these are capable of adhering to the substrate and starting new colonies. Even such massive corals as &quot;Montastraea annularis&quot; have been shown to be capable of forming new colonies after fragmentation. This process is used in the reef aquarium hobby to increase stock without the necessity to harvest corals from the wild.

Under adverse conditions, certain species of coral resort to another type of asexual reproduction in the form of &quot;polyp bail-out&quot;, which may allow polyps to survive even though the parent colony dies. It involves the growth of the coenosarc to seal off the polyps, detachment of the polyps and their settlement on the seabed to initiate new colonies. In other species, small balls of tissue detach themselves from the coenosarc, differentiate into polyps and start secreting calcium carbonate to form new colonies, and in &quot;Pocillopora damicornis&quot;, unfertilised eggs can develop into viable larvae.

=== Sexual reproduction ===

The overwhelming majority of scleractinian taxa are hermaphroditic in their adult colonies. In temperate regions, the usual pattern is synchronized release of eggs and sperm into the water during brief spawning events, often related to the phases of the moon. In tropical regions, reproduction may occur throughout the year. In many cases, as in the genus &quot;Acropora&quot;, the eggs and sperm are released in buoyant bundles which rise to the surface. This increases the concentration of sperm and eggs and thus the likelihood of fertilization, and reduces the risk of self-fertilization. Immediately after spawning, the eggs are delayed in their capability for fertilization until after the release of polar bodies. This delay, and possibly some degree of self-incompatibility, likely increases the chance of cross-fertilization. A study of four species of &quot;Scleractinia&quot; found that cross-fertilization was actually the dominant mating pattern, although three of the species were also capable of self-fertilization to varying extents.

== Evolutionary history ==

There is little evidence on which to base a hypothesis about the origin of the scleractinians; plenty is known about modern species but very little about fossil specimens, which first appeared in the record in the Middle Triassic (). It was not until 25 million years later that they became important reef builders, their success likely a result of teaming up with symbiotic algae. Nine of the sub-orders were in existence by the end of the Triassic and three more had appeared by the Jurassic (200 million years ago), with a further suborder appearing in the Middle Cretaceous (100 million years ago). Some may have developed from a common ancestor, either an anemone-like coral without a skeleton, or a rugose coral. A rugose coral seems an unlikely common ancestor because these corals had calcite rather than aragonite skeletons, and the septa were arranged serially rather than cyclically. However, it may be that similarities of scleractinians to rugosans are due to a common non-skeletalized ancestor in the early Paleozoic. Alternatively, scleractinians may have developed from a Corallimorpharia-like ancestor. It seems that skeletogenesis may have been associated with the development of symbiosis and reef formation, and may have occurred on more than one occasion. DNA sequencing appears to indicate that scleractinian corals are a monophyletic group.

The earliest scleractinians were not reef builders, but were small, phaceloid or solitary individuals. Scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest diversity in the Jurassic and all but disappeared in the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous, about 18 out of 67 genera surviving. Recently discovered Paleozoic corals with aragonitic skeletons and cyclic septal insertion – two features that characterize Scleractinia – have strengthened the hypothesis for an independent origin of the Scleractinia. Whether the early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an open question. The phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during the Tertiary, and the genera &quot;Astrangia&quot;, &quot;Madracis&quot;, &quot;Cladocora&quot; and &quot;Oculina&quot;, all in different families, each have both zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate members.

The fact that zooxanthellate coral make up only about half of the order is unusual, as symbiosis is almost always an all-or-nothing phenomenon. This symbiotic equilibrium suggests that there must be evolutionary processes simultaneously maintaining and limiting symbiotic relationships. This is likely because despite the energetic benefits it provides, photosymbiosis appears to be an evolutionary disadvantage during mass extinctions. Traits that generally enable corals to survive mass extinction include deep-water or large habitat range, non-symbiotic, solitary or small colonies, and bleaching resistance, all of which tend to characterize azooxanthellate (non-symbiotic) corals. Endosymbionts, on the other hand, which rely on specialized conditions and access to light to survive, are especially vulnerable to prolonged darkness, temperature change, and eutrophication, all of which have been hallmarks of past mass extinctions. This makes zooxanthellate coral especially vulnerable to unstable conditions. Therefore, it is possible that coral and zooxanthellate coevolved loosely, with the relationship dissolving when advantages decreased, then reforming when conditions stabilized.

== Classification ==

The taxonomy of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described before the advent of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when that description is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.

Even the concept of &quot;the species&quot; is suspect, with regard to corals which have large geographical ranges with a number of sub-populations; their geographic boundaries merge with those of other species; their morphological boundaries merge with those of other species; and there are no definite distinctions between species and subspecies.

The evolutionary relationships among stony corals were first examined in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex skeletal characters; The 1857 classification of the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime&#x27;s was based on macroscopic skeletal characters, while Francis Grant Ogilvie&#x27;s 1897 scheme was developed using observations of skeletal microstructures, with particular attention to the structure and pattern of the septal trabeculae. In 1943, the American zoologists Thomas Wayland Vaughan and John West Wells, and Wells again in 1956, used the patterns of the septal trabeculae to divide the group into five suborders. In addition, they considered polypoid features such as the growth of the tentacles. They also distinguished families by wall type and type of budding.

The 1952 classification by French zoologist J. Alloiteau was built on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill stressed the importance of microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.

The rise of molecular techniques at the end of the 20th century prompted new evolutionary hypotheses that were different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results of molecular studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for hypotheses about extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that molecular data supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but not into the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree. In addition, there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades, only molecular differences.

The Australian zoologist John Veron and his co-workers analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.

==Conservation==

<text>Lars Levi Laestadius (; 10 January 1800 – 21 February 1861) was a Swedish Sami writer, ecologist, mythologist, and ethnographer as well as a pastor and administrator of the Swedish state Lutheran church in Lapland who founded the Laestadian pietist revival movement to help his largely Sami congregations, who were being ravaged by alcoholism. Laestadius himself became a teetotaller (except for his ongoing use of wine in holy Communion) in the 1840s, when he began successfully talking his Sami parishioners out of alcoholism. Laestadius was also a noted botanist and an author.

==Early life==
===Birth and education===
Laestadius was born in Swedish Lapland at Jäckvik near Arjeplog in a western mountainous part of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden, to Carl Laestadius (1746-1832)—a Swedish hunter, fisherman, tar-maker, and one-time silver mine bailiff, who lost his job due to alcoholism—and Anna Magdalena (née Johansdotter) (1759-1824), who was the elder Laestadius&#x27;s second wife. Both were of distant Sami descent. The family lived in poverty due to Carl Laestadius&#x27;s alcoholism and extended absences. However, with help from Lars Levi&#x27;s older half-brother Carl Erik Laestadius (1775-1817), a pastor at Kvikkjokk, with whom Lars Levi and his younger brother Petrus (1802-1841) lived part of their childhood, the boys were able to pursue educations, first at Härnösand and starting in 1820, at Uppsala University. Due to their benefactor half-brother&#x27;s death in 1817, the boys were constantly short of funds from the outset of their university studies. Nevertheless, Lars Levi proved to be a brilliant student. Because of his interest in botany, he was made assistant in the botany department while pursuing studies in theology. 
Lars Levi Laestadius was ordained a Lutheran priest in 1825 by the bishop of Härnösand, Erik Abraham Almquist.

===Marriage and family===
In 1827 Laestadius married Brita Katarina Alstadius, a local Sami woman who was a childhood friend of his; and together they had twelve children, at least two of whom died in childhood.

==Laestadius&#x27;s Lutheran ministry and revival movement==

===Parishes where he served===
Laestadius&#x27;s first parish was at Arjeplog in Lapland, where he became the regional missionary for the Pite district. From 1826 to 1849 he was the vicar in Karesuando parish in Lapland. Near the end of his tenure in Karesuando, Laestadius applied for the positions of dean in Pajala parish in Norrbotten County and inspector of the Lapland parishes. After he complemented his exams in Härnösand as required, he took over these offices in 1849 and held them until his death in 1861.

===Revival movement===
At the time of Laestadius&#x27;s 1826 arrival in Karesuando, the people of Lapland parish suffered from widespread misery and alcoholism.

====Laestadius&#x27;s awakening====
Laestadius met a Sami woman named Milla Clementsdotter of Föllinge (also known as Lapp Mary by the Laestadian Lutheran Church) in the municipality of Krokom in Jämtland during an 1844 inspection tour of Åsele in Lapland. She belonged to a revival movement marked by pietistic and Moravian influences and led by pastor Pehr Brandell of the parish of Nora in the municipality of Kramfors in Ångermanland.

She told Laestadius about her experiences on her journey to living faith. This was an important meeting for Laestadius because after it, he said he first understood the secret of living faith. He had a religious experience, and he wrote later that he at last saw the path that leads to eternal life. His sermons acquired, in his own words, &quot;a new kind of colour&quot; to which people began to respond. The movement spread quickly from Sweden to Finland and Norway.

====Initial effect on parishioners====
According to an account from the Sami cultural perspective,

:&quot;[T]he Sami began to notice that...Laestadius had changed. His sermons were filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand. He preached about a God who cared about the lives of the people. He attacked priests and traders who lined their pockets at the expense of others... After twenty years, something new had begun to happen between the pastor and his parishioners. Young and old alike wanted to learn to read. There was also a bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness (within [Finnish] Laestadianism this was known as liikutuksia, a kind of ecstasy). Not everybody liked it, of course... Those who had previously earned a lot of money through the sale of liquor saw their incomes disappear and derided the new morals... Drunkenness and the theft of reindeer diminished, which had a positive influence on the Sami&#x27;s relationships, finances and family life.&quot;

====Resistance====
The resistance to Laestadius&#x27;s radical Christian ethics and morals and to his way of confronting the parishioners about their sins was greater in Pajala where Laestadius moved in 1849; and the bishop decided in 1853 that two separate church services should be held, one for the Laestadians and one for the others. It could be said that Laestadianism, the religious revival named after him, became a movement in its own right at this time, although it remained within and never separated from the Church of Sweden.

==== Rise of Laestadianism among the Sami ====
The rapid rise of Laestadianism among the Sami was due to several factors. Laestadius proudly self-identified as Southern Sami through his mother and spoke and preached in two Sami dialects. Further he chose uneducated lay preachers from the Sami reindeer herders to travel year around with them and preach to the unrepented. Additionally, in the early days of the movement, Laestadius, in order to find common ground with his parishioners, borrowed the Samis&#x27; own familiar pagan deities and concepts and adapted them to Christianity. Another factor in the rise of Laestadianism among the Sami was that the state-mandated boarding schools soon came to be populated by Laestadian personnel. Next, the strict moral code including strict temperance of Laestadianism appealed to the Sami. Whole communities that had been wrecked by alcoholism went dry virtually overnight. This had the added positive effect of improving the Samis&#x27; social standing with the outside world. 

Finally, Laestadianism was a faith that the Sami could identify as originating from within insofar that Laestadius himself professed to have come to know the true living faith only upon his encounter with Milla Clementsdotter.

====Successor====
When Laestadius died in 1861, he was succeeded by Johan Raattamaa as the leader of the Laestadian movement.

==Botanist==
Laestadius undertook his first botanic trip as a student. Later the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences paid him to travel to Skåne in southern Sweden and to Lapland, to study and make drawings of plants, to be used in Swedish botany scientific work. He was as an internationally recognized botanist and a member of the Edinburgh Botanical Society as well as the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala.

A number of plant species have been named for Laestadius, e.g.:
* &quot;Salix laestadiana&quot; Hartm.
* &quot;Carex laestadii&quot; Holmb.
* &quot;Papaver laestadianum&quot; Nordh.

Laestadius named many plant species:

==La Recherche Expedition (1838-1840)==
While attending to his pastoral duties, Laestadius continued his interest in botany and authored a number of articles on plant life in Lapland. Because of the wide recognition for his knowledge of botany and the Sami, the French Admiralty invited Laestadius to participate in the La Recherche Expedition to Samiland of 1838–40. As an expedition member, Laestadius served as field guide for the islands and the interior of Northern Norway and Sweden, studying both plant life and the culture of the Sami inhabitants.

During the expedition, Laestadius at the request of the organizers began his manuscript. Eventually published for the first time more than 150 years later &quot;Fragments of Lappish Mythology&quot; provides a snapshot of Sami traditional religious beliefs that by the 1830s were passing into history due to the Church of Sweden&#x27;s Christianization mandate in full swing at that time. However, Laestadius did not finish the manuscript until long afterward, and the completed work was lost for many years. Due to these and other reasons, the manuscript was not published until 1997, over 150 years after the expedition.

For his participation in the La Recherche Expedition, Laestadius was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Legion of Honor of France after 1841. He was the first Scandinavian to receive this honor.

==Languages spoken==
Laestadius&#x27;s mother tongues were Southern Sami from his mother and Swedish, the language of his childhood home, from his father. Laestadius also spoke Pite Sami. After a year in Karesuando, Laestadius spoke Finnish and Northern Sami as well. He usually held his services in Finnish since it was the most widespread language in the area, but on occasion also preached in the Northern Sami and Swedish languages.

==Family deaths and personal illnesses==
After the death of his older half-brother and financial support, Carl Erik, when Lars Levi was only a teenager, Laestadius mourned the deaths of his mother in 1824, his father in 1832, and his younger brother Petrus in 1841. At least two of Laestadius&#x27;s own sons reportedly predeceased him as well.

Around 1833 Laestadius suffered from an ailment which the doctors first thought was pneumonia. He recovered. In the 1840s, Laestadius suffered from severe typhoid fever and later tuberculosis. Towards the end of his life, Laestadius experienced &quot;impending blindness&quot; and contracted a cholera-like illness.

<text>William Paul Jarrett (August 22, 1877 – November 10, 1929) was a sheriff and congressional delegate representing the Territory of Hawaii.

==Biography==
Jarrett was born August 22, 1877, and grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu, and attended Saint Louis School. Of Native Hawaiian descent, his father was William Haalilo Jarrett and mother was Emma Kaoo Stevens. He married Mary Heanu Kalanienohoikawaiohilo Kekaiulaokala Clark with whom he had six children.

Jarrett became one of the earliest leaders of the Hawaii Democratic Party. Jarrett served as deputy Sheriff of the City and County of Honolulu from 1906 to 1908, Sheriff until 1914, and High Sheriff of the Territory of Hawaii from 1914 to 1922.

From March 4, 1923, to March 3, 1927, Jarrett served in the United States Congress as a territorial delegate. He won elections in November 1922 and 1924, but lost the bid for re-election in 1927. He died on November 10, 1929.

He was interred at Diamond Head Memorial Park. William P. Jarrett Middle School, established in 1955, was named after him.

<text>Royal Air Force Henlow or more simply RAF Henlow is a Royal Air Force station in Bedfordshire, England, equidistant from Bedford, Luton and Stevenage. It houses the RAF Centre of Aerospace Medicine and the Joint Arms Control Implementation Group (JACIG), and was home to the Signals Museum, which closed in June 2024. It formerly hosted light aircraft flying and 616 Volunteer Gliding Squadron. The Ministry of Defence announced on 6 September 2016 that the base is set to be closed. As of January 2024, the closure and disposal of the station is expected to take place from 2026. Flying activity ceased in July 2020.

==History==
Henlow was chosen as a military aircraft repair depot in 1917 and was built by MacAlpine during 1918. Four Belfast Hangars were built and are now listed buildings. Henlow Camp, a civilian settlement, grew up around the base at that time.

Originally a repair depot for aircraft from the Western Front, the Station officially opened on 18 May 1918 when Lt Col Robert Francis Stapleton-Cotton arrived with a party of 40 airmen from Farnborough. In May 1920, RAF Henlow became the first parachute testing centre and was later joined by another parachute unit from RAF Northolt. Parachute testing was undertaken with Vimy aircraft and parachutists hanging off the wings and allowing the chute to deploy and enable them to drift back to the ground. The Officers Engineering School moved there in 1924 from Farnborough.

After the First World War, Henlow was home to four aircraft squadrons; No. 19 Squadron RAF, No. 23 Squadron RAF, No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 80 Squadron RAF. Between 1932 and 1933, Sir Frank Whittle was a student at the RAF technical College on the base. He later spent some time in charge of aero engine testing on the base before being sent to Cambridge. An additional hangar was added to the inventory in the 1930s and this too is now listed.

During the Second World War Henlow was used to assemble the Hawker Hurricanes which had been built at the Hurricane factory operated by Canadian Car and Foundry in Fort William, Ontario, Canada, under the leadership of Elsie MacGill. After test flying in Fort William, they were disassembled and sent to Henlow in shipping containers and reassembled. During Operation Quickforce in 1941, 100 fitters from the base were deployed onto carriers which were shipping Hurricane fighters to Malta. The finished Hurricanes were completed on the decks of the carriers and flown out to Malta. Over 1,000 Hurricanes (about 10% of the total) were built by Canadian Car and Foundry and shipped to Henlow. Henlow was also used as a repair base for many aircraft types under the direction of No. 13 Maintenance Unit.

The empty packing crates that the Hurricane aircraft were shipped in were used to make the original control tower (which has now been replaced by a more modern two-storey Portakabin type). The original tower and parts of the airfield were seen in several scenes in the 1969 war film &#x27;The Battle of Britain&#x27;.

A major RAF technical training college was also formed at Henlow in 1947. This was formed from the RAF School of Aeronautical Engineering, formerly at RAF Farnborough, and its purpose was to train cadets and engineering officers. The college was amalgamated with RAF College Cranwell in 1965. The RAF Officer Cadet Training Unit then moved in, but this also moved to Cranwell in 1980.

Henlow then hosted the RAF Signals Engineering Establishment and the Radio Engineering Unit, established in 1980. In 1983, the Land Registry took over part of the site.

In December 2011, RAF Henlow along with 14 other Ministry of Defence sites in the United Kingdom were designated as being dangerously radioactive. The 15 bases were poisoned by &quot;radium that was used to coat the dials of aircraft...so that they could be seen in the dark&quot; during the Second World War.

Administratively, RAF Henlow was part of a combined base, RAF Brampton Wyton Henlow, until RAF Brampton was closed in 2013.

Flying activity ceased in July 2020.

<doc id="904585" wikidata="Q1495657" url="?curid=904585" title="Gastrointestinal bleeding">
<text>Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), also called gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIB), is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black stool. Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out. Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present.
Bleeding is typically divided into two main types: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Causes of upper GI bleeds include: peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis and cancer, among others. Causes of lower GI bleeds include: hemorrhoids, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease among others. Small amounts of bleeding may be detected by fecal occult blood test. Endoscopy of the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract may locate the area of bleeding. Medical imaging may be useful in cases that are not clear. Bleeding may also be diagnosed and treated during minimally invasive angiography procedures such as hemorrhoidal artery embolization.
Initial treatment focuses on resuscitation which may include intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. Often blood transfusions are not recommended unless the hemoglobin is less than 70 or 80 g/L. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, octreotide, and antibiotics may be considered in certain cases. If other measures are not effective, an esophageal balloon may be attempted in those with presumed esophageal varices. Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum or endoscopy of the large bowel are generally recommended within 24 hours and may allow treatment as well as diagnosis.
An upper GI bleed is more common than lower GI bleed. An upper GI bleed occurs in 50 to 150 per 100,000 adults per year. A lower GI bleed is estimated to occur in 20 to 30 per 100,000 per year. It results in about 300,000 hospital admissions a year in the United States. Risk of death from a GI bleed is between 5% and 30%. Risk of bleeding is more common in males and increases with age.

==Classification==

Gastrointestinal bleeding can be roughly divided into two clinical syndromes: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. About 2/3 of all GI bleeds are from upper sources and 1/3 from lower sources. Common causes of gastrointestinal bleeding include infections, cancers, vascular disorders, adverse effects of medications, and blood clotting disorders. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) is when a source is unclear following investigation.

===Upper gastrointestinal===

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is from a source between the pharynx and the ligament of Treitz. An upper source is characterised by hematemesis (vomiting up blood) and melena (tarry stool containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcers). Esophageal inflammation and erosive disease are the next most common causes. In those with liver cirrhosis, 50–60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. Other causes include Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia.

A number of medications are found to cause upper GI bleeds. NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk about fourfold. SSRIs, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants may also increase the risk. The risk with dabigatran is 30% greater than that with warfarin.

===Lower gastrointestinal===

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is typically from the colon, rectum or anus. Common causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding include hemorrhoids, cancer, angiodysplasia, ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and aortoenteric fistula. It may be indicated by the passage of fresh red blood rectally, especially in the absence of bloody vomiting. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding could also lead to melena if the bleeding occurs in the small intestine or proximal colon.

==Signs and symptoms==
Gastrointestinal bleeding can range from small non-visible amounts, which are only detected by laboratory testing, to massive bleeding where bright red blood is passed and shock develops. Rapid bleeding may cause syncope. The presence of bright red blood in stool, known as hematochezia, typically indicates lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Digested blood from the upper gastrointestinal tract may appear black rather than red, resulting in &quot;coffee ground&quot; vomit or melena. Other signs and symptoms include feeling tired, dizziness, and pale skin color.

A number of foods and medications can turn the stool either red or black in the absence of bleeding. Bismuth found in many antacids may turn stools black as may activated charcoal. Blood from the vagina or urinary tract may also be confused with blood in the stool.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is often based on direct observation of blood in the stool or vomit. Although fecal occult blood testing has been used in an emergency setting, this use is not recommended as the test has only been validated for colon cancer screening. Differentiating between upper and lower bleeding in some cases can be difficult. The severity of an upper GI bleed can be judged based on the Blatchford score or Rockall score. The Rockall score is the more accurate of the two. As of 2008 there is no scoring system useful for lower GI bleeds.

===Clinical===
Gastric aspiration and or lavage, where a tube is inserted into the stomach via the nose in an attempt to determine if there is blood in the stomach, if negative does not rule out an upper GI bleed but if positive is useful for ruling one in. Clots in the stool indicate a lower GI source while melana stools an upper one.

===Laboratory testing===
Recommended laboratory blood testing includes: cross-matching blood, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, coagulation time, and electrolytes. If the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine is greater than 30 the source is more likely from the upper GI tract.

===Imaging===
A CT angiography is useful for determining the exact location of the bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract. Nuclear scintigraphy is a sensitive test for detecting occult gastrointestinal bleeding when direct imaging with upper and lower endoscopies are negative. Direct angiography allows for embolization of a bleeding source, but requires a bleeding rate faster than 1mL/minute.

==Prevention==
In patients with significant varices or cirrhosis nonselective β-blockers reduce the risk of future bleeding. With a target heart rate of 55 beats per minute B-blockers reduce the absolute risk of bleeding by 10%. Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is also effective at improving outcomes. Either B-blockers or EBL is recommended as initial preventative measures. In patients who have had a previous variceal bleed both treatments are recommended. Some evidence supports the addition of isosorbide mononitrate. Testing for and treating those who are positive for &quot;H. pylori&quot; is recommended. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may be used to prevent bleeding in people who re-bleed despite other measures.

Among patients admitted to the ICU with high risk of bleeding, a PPI or H2RA appears useful.

==Treatment==
The initial focus is on resuscitation beginning with airway management and fluid resuscitation using either intravenous fluids and or blood. A number of medications may improve outcomes depending on the source of the bleeding.

===Peptic ulcers===
Based on evidence from people with other health problems crystalloid and colloids are believed to be equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment before endoscopy may decrease the need for endoscopic hemostatic treatment, however it is not clear if this treatment reduces mortality, the risk of re-bleeding, or the and the need for surgery. Oral and intravenous formulations may be equivalent; however, the evidence to support this is suboptimal. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. There is tentative evidence of benefit for tranexamic acid which inhibits clot breakdown. Somatostatin and octreotide, while recommended for varicial bleeding, have not been found to be of general use for non variceal bleeds. After treatment of a high risk bleeding ulcer endoscopically giving a PPI once or a day rather than as an infusion appears to work just as well and is less expensive (the method may be either by mouth or intravenously).

===Variceal bleeding===
For initial fluid replacement, colloids or albumin is preferred in people with cirrhosis. Medications typically include octreotide or, if not available, vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal venous pressures. Terlipressin appears to be more effective than octreotide, but it is not available in many areas of the world. It is the only medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in acute variceal bleeding. This is in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In those with cirrhosis, antibiotics decrease the chance of bleeding again, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and decrease mortality. Octreotide reduces the need for blood transfusions and may decrease mortality. No trials of vitamin K have been conducted.

===Blood products===
The evidence for benefit of blood transfusions in GI bleed is poor with some evidence finding harm. In those in shock O-negative packed red blood cells are recommended. If large amounts of pack red blood cells are used additional platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be administered to prevent coagulopathies. In alcoholics FFP is suggested before confirmation of a coagulopathy due to presumed blood clotting problems. Evidence supports holding off on blood transfusions in those who have a hemoglobin greater than 7 to 8 g/dL and moderate bleeding, including in those with preexisting coronary artery disease.

If the INR is greater than 1.5 to 1.8 correction with fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex may decrease mortality. Evidence of a harm or benefit of recombinant activated factor VII in those with liver diseases and gastrointestinal bleeding is not determined. A massive transfusion protocol may be used, but there is a lack of evidence for this indication.

===Procedures===

The benefits versus risks of placing a nasogastric tube in those with upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopic evaluation within 24 hours is recommended, in addition to medical management. A number of endoscopic treatments may be used, including: epinephrine injection, band ligation, sclerotherapy, and fibrin glue depending on what is found. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endoscopy can decrease the amount of blood in the stomach and thus improve the operators view. They also decrease the amount of blood transfusions required. Early endoscopy decreases hospital and the amount of blood transfusions needed. A second endoscopy within a day is routinely recommended by some but by others only in specific situations. Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. High and low dose PPIs appear equivalent at this point. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72 hours. Those at low risk of re-bleeding may begin eating typically 24 hours following endoscopy. If other measures fail or are not available, esophageal balloon tamponade may be attempted. While there is a success rate up to 90%, there are some potentially significant complications including aspiration and esophageal perforation.

Colonoscopy is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of lower GI bleeding. A number of techniques may be employed including clipping, cauterizing, and sclerotherapy. Preparation for colonoscopy takes a minimum of six hours which in those bleeding briskly may limit its applicability. Surgery, while rarely used to treat upper GI bleeds, is still commonly used to manage lower GI bleeds by cutting out the part of the intestines that is causing the problem. Angiographic embolization may be used for both upper and lower GI bleeds. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may also be considered.

==Prognosis==
Death in those with a GI bleed is more commonly due to other illnesses (some of which may have contributed to the bleed, such as cancer or cirrhosis) than the bleeding itself. Of those admitted to a hospital because of a GI bleed, death occurs in about 7%. Despite treatment, re-bleeding occurs in about 7–16% of those with upper GI bleeding. In those with esophageal varices, bleeding occurs in about 5–15% a year and if they have bled once, there is a higher risk of further bleeding within six weeks. Testing and treating &quot;H. pylori&quot; if found can prevent re-bleeding in those with peptic ulcers. The benefits versus risks of restarting blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin and anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs need to be carefully considered. If aspirin is needed for cardiovascular disease prevention, it is reasonable to restart it within seven days in combination with a PPI for those with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.

==Epidemiology==
Gastrointestinal bleeding from the upper tract occurs in 50 to 150 per 100,000 adults per year. It is more common than lower gastrointestinal bleeding which is estimated to occur at the rate of 20 to 30 per 100,000 per year. Risk of bleeding is more common in males and increases with age.

<text>Long Beach Island (colloquially known as LBI, The LBI Region, or simply The Island) is a barrier island and summer colony along the Atlantic Ocean coast of Ocean County, New Jersey, United States, on the Jersey Shore. Aligned north to south, the northern portion generally has more expensive low-density housing, whereas the southern portion possesses higher-density housing and considerable commercial development. Long Beach Island is 1-2 miles away from Mainland New Jersey. The primary industries include tourism, fishing, and real estate. The only access point to the island by land is a single causeway. The island is the southernmost point of the New York Metropolitan Area.

The island is home to about 10,000 people on a year-round basis. The population is distributed among six separate municipalities, the largest of which is Long Beach Township. However, the island&#x27;s population swells significantly during the summer months and reaches about 100,000 people, including part-time residents and tourists, who are often referred to as &quot;shoobies&quot;. The island&#x27;s close-knit communities are largely affluent and contain vacation homes for wealthy individuals who reside elsewhere, primarily New Jersey as well as New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.

The island and its properties and economy are expected to be severely affected by sea level rise. By 2013, sea level had increased by six inches and is expected to rise at least another six inches by 2030. Most projections suggest over a meter of sea level rise by 2100 and would require significant climate change adaptation to survive, making both property protection and an engineered retreat economically unattractive.

==Geography==


Long Beach Island is located north of Atlantic City east-southeast of Philadelphia and south of New York City. LBI is approximately in length, which includes three miles (5 km) of marsh protected as part of Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge located on the southern tip. The island is about a half-mile wide (800 m) at its widest point in Ship Bottom, and spans a fifth of a mile (300 m) at its narrowest point in Harvey Cedars.

Long Beach Island is bisected by State Route 72, formerly &quot;South 40&quot;, which connects the mainland to the island at Ship Bottom. It is the sole access point for road vehicles to the mainland over Manahawkin Bay. This results in the division of the island into a northern portion and a southern portion. From the bridge northward, the island includes the communities of Surf City, North Beach (a section of Long Beach Township), Harvey Cedars, Loveladies (a section of Long Beach Township), High Bar Harbor (the northernmost section of Long Beach Township), and Barnegat Light. From the bridge southward, the island includes the communities of Ship Bottom, North Beach Haven (a census-designated place in Long Beach Township that includes Brant Beach and Beach Haven Gardens), Beach Haven, and the Holgate section of Long Beach Township at the southernmost tip of the island.

==History==
The Lenape people were the original inhabitants of Long Beach Island, utilizing the island primarily as a summer retreat for fishing and clamming due to its abundant natural resources in the early 1600s. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1969s, when the island became continuously settled on, initially by hunters and Europeans. Barnegat Inlet, to the north of the island, was an important path for freight shipments and whaling from the 17th century through the 20th century. Due to the inlet&#x27;s importance and its turbulent waters, a lighthouse tower was constructed in 1835 to guide shippers through the area. Still, it was inadequate to ships, constantly being mistaken for another passing ship because the light was fixed. Erosion problems destroyed the tower in 1857, two years before the current Barnegat Lighthouse was completed in 1859, flashing at each compass point every 10 seconds. It was constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the supervision of George Gordon Meade, famous for leading the Union forces to victory four years later during the Civil War at the Battle of Gettysburg. The United States Life-Saving Service built Station #17 in Barnegat Light (then known as Brownsville) around 1872, which continues today as a United States Coast Guard station.

A developing tourism sector prompted the Tuckerton Railroad (a short line running from Tuckerton to Whiting) to build a bridge across Barnegat bay that ran from Barnegat city to Beach Haven; the tracks were completed in 1886 and were leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). The Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 included a fatal attack in Beach Haven, killing University of Pennsylvania student Charles Vansant in July 1916, which partly inspired the book &quot;Jaws&quot;. A severe winter storm in 1920 destroyed most of the beaches along the island, several hotels, and reopening the new inlet in Holgate. A storm in 1923 further diminished the tourism sector, resulting in the discontinuation of train service to Barnegat City between 1923 and 1926. In 1935, the railroad bridge to the mainland washed out, leaving the entire island without rail service.

Several storms throughout the island&#x27;s history have resulted in the island being split in two, with the division occurring at the island&#x27;s narrowest point in Harvey Cedars. The most famous of such storms was the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, which split Long Beach Island into numerous pieces and nearly destroyed the island in its entirety. The storm caused the destroyer USS Monssen to run aground in Beach Haven Inlet, Long Beach Township. The existing Route 72 Causeway was erected in the late 1950s, which replaced a low-level two-lane automobile bridge which in itself had replaced the previously destroyed railroad bridge.

===Hurricane Sandy===

In late October 2012, portions of Long Beach Island were significantly damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Residents were evacuated, and portions of the island were severely flooded, with the ocean meeting the bay in isolated spots. Streets were left covered with up to four feet of sand in some spots. The nine-foot storm surge and 18-foot seas that pounded the barrier island damaged several homes along the ocean and bayfront communities.

The Manahawkin Bay Bridge remained closed to residents for a full 13 days following the storm. Locals were prohibited from returning to the island except for brief visits to retrieve belongings. Bulldozers and front-end loaders moved hundreds of tons of sand, along with power lines and boats, in an attempt to make the roadways passable. Long Beach Island was finally re-opened to residents and building owners on November 10, with the exception of the Holgate section of Long Beach Township, where infrastructure and road damage was still too dangerous. However, island officials warned that some areas were still without sewerage, water and electric service at that time.

Damage was distributed unevenly throughout the island. Areas with a protective dune system had limited damage, while areas without dunes or where dunes were breached received significantly more damage. In those neighborhoods — in sections like Holgate, on the island&#x27;s southern tip — destruction was severe. The protective dunes, an ambitious project developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, have been a source of controversy in recent years and have led to conflict between local officials arguing for the need of dunes and property owners who felt that the dunes devalued their property. As such, the work is incomplete and there are significant breaks in the dune system. Other hard-hit areas included Loveladies and North Beach. Areas where the dune system was in place fared much better, such as Harvey Cedars, Ship Bottom, Surf City and Barnegat Light.

Electricity was restored to 70% of the Island by November 4, 2012. By November 20, 2012, natural gas service was restored to nearly the entire Island.

By mid-November, many businesses were re-opened on Long Beach Island with life resuming as normal for much of the Island by mid-December.

==Demographics==
There are six separate municipalities on Long Beach Island. Long Beach Township is the largest of these, and subdivides into multiple neighborhoods:

* Barnegat Light
* Beach Haven
* Harvey Cedars
* Long Beach Township
** Brant Beach
** Beach Haven Crest
** Beach Haven Gardens
** Beach Haven Inlet
** Beach Haven Park
** Beach Haven Terrace
** Brighton Beach
** Haven Beach
** High Bar Harbor 
** Holgate
** Loveladies
** North Beach Haven
** North Beach
** Peahala Park
** South Beach Haven
** Spray Beach
* Ship Bottom
* Surf City

==Culture==
In the 1970s, an article in &quot;Philadelphia Magazine&quot; quipped that, &quot;The haves turn right (south) and the have mores turn left (north),&quot; referring to the option of turning right or left when arriving on the island from the bridge. Nominally accurate, the low-density northern end of the island, Loveladies, North Beach, and the surrounding neighborhoods are home to an assortment of large-scale waterfront homes which attract considerable attention from visitors and are often the source of rumors regarding vacationing celebrities during the summertime. The southern community of Beach Haven features historic and elegant Victorian homes that have survived the many storms. The south end contains significantly more commercial zoning, which generally decreases north of the bridge. Year-round residents and businesses in operation are more common toward the southern end of the island, particularly in the larger boroughs of Beach Haven and Ship Bottom.

Long Beach Island typically attracts a family-oriented crowd during the summertime, unlike more frenzied beach vacation destinations such as Belmar and Seaside Heights. The island has not contained a boardwalk since the one in Beach Haven was washed away by the 1944 hurricane, and the nightlife is limited to a few bars. Visitors generally participate in activities such as miniature golf, parasailing, jet-skiing, walking, shopping, and relaxing on the beaches. The island has a reputation as a base for many long-range recreational fishing and charter boats, whose trips can range from from one of the island&#x27;s two inlets (at Barnegat Light in the north and Beach Haven in the south.) In 2009, the Lighthouse International Film Festival was launched on the island. The three-day event screens films in venues throughout the island. Other art venues include the Surflight Theatre in Beach Haven and numerous art galleries throughout the island. The Surflight Theatre was closed due to foreclosure but has now reopened with plans to expand the number of shows presented yearly.

===Beach replenishment===
Some of the island&#x27;s of beaches have experienced significant erosion in recent decades, threatening the multimillion-dollar waterfront homes in the area. In 2005, with the help of the Army Corps of Engineers, work began on a $75 million project to build a high, wide dune the length of the island using sand pumped from offshore. In front of the dunes, a wide stretch of sand separates the dune from the ocean. The beach replenishment project began in Ship Bottom and Surf City. With work on those beaches now complete, the project continues toward the northern end of the island. Beach replenishment has been a hugely controversial topic. Many surfers and swimmers argue that pumping the sand destroys the sandbars that create waves and provide a better swimming environment. Some homeowners claim dunes will reduce property value, while island officials argue dunes are necessary to counter beach erosion and protect the island from storms.

==Transportation==
Bisecting the developed region is the sole access point for road vehicles, via State Route 72, which consists of the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge (locally known as &quot;The Causeway&quot;, though the term is incorrect in its application). The bridge is known for its &quot;String of Pearls&quot;, a row of lights mounted on the railings lining the length of the bridge. The bridge was designed by an African American, New Jersey Department of Transportation engineer, Dorland J. Henderson who also designed the unique bridge lights. The bridge extends from Manahawkin on the mainland to Ship Bottom on the island. The island can also be reached by water transport. A $155-million plan unveiled by the New Jersey Department of Transportation in 2005 added a second span and will replace the existing bridge.

The new southern span was opened in 2016 and the original bridge was built over the following three years, with the project finishing in 2019.

Within the island, one road forms the backbone of all transportation: County Route 607. This road, which is known as Bay Avenue in Beach Haven, Central Avenue and Broadway in Barnegat Light, and Long Beach Boulevard across the remainder of the island, runs the length of LBI and connects all the separate municipalities on the island as well as the separate sections of Long Beach Township.

For public transit, NJ Transit Bus 559 Lakewood-Atlantic City runs to Manahawkin.
Ocean Ride local service is provided on the OC9 Long Beach Island route.

TransportAzumah offers daily service during the summer season between Midtown Manhattan in New York City and Long Beach Island with a stop at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The LBI Shuttle runs the 18-mile length of the island on Long Beach Boulevard. It provides $2 service from 10am to 10pm and $5 service from 10pm to close. It serves the Long Beach Island municipalities / communities of Barnegat Light, Loveladies, Harvey Cedars, North Beach, Surf City, Ship Bottom, Long Beach Township, Beach Haven and Holgate.

==Notable locations==
The historic Barnegat Lighthouse is located in Barnegat Lighthouse State Park at the northern tip of the island, along the Barnegat Inlet. The conical tower stands 165 feet (50 m) tall, and the park includes several trails through native foliage and along the jetty constructed in the 1990s. The scallop boat &quot;Lindsay L&quot;, docked near Viking Village in Barnegat Light, was used in the movie &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;. The lighthouse is open daily from 10 AM to 4:30 PM (weather permitting) from Memorial Day through Labor Day. There is a $3 fee per person to enter the lighthouse from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Children ages 6 to 11 are $1, and children ages 5 and under are free and must be accompanied by an adult. Visitors can also catch the views from the top without climbing the 217 steps, thanks to four cameras that transmit live images of the view to a display in the adjacent Interpretive Center.

Loveladies is home to the Long Beach Island Foundation of the Arts and Sciences, established in 1948 by artist Boris Blai. The organization provides arts, science and recreation programs to area residents and visitors. The foundation offers an After School Arts Education Program to area schools, an Artists Residency and Retreat Program for New Jersey Artists, Visiting Artists in Ceramics during the summer season, and ceramics scholarships and residency opportunities.

To the south, in Beach Haven, the Fantasy Island Amusement Park is the only full-time location on the island with standard-fare amusement rides (including a classically designed carousel). Fantasy Island offers rides, games, food, live entertainment, and a family-style casino arcade. Entertainment, admission, and parking are free. The annual Festival Of The Sea carnival also makes an appearance at the St. Francis Community Church in Brant Beach every August for one week per year. Lucille&#x27;s Oh Fudge! Candies has a large salt water taffy display in front of its shop in Brant Beach, a candy that was first created in nearby Atlantic City. Lucille&#x27;s candy also has a location on Route 72 in Manahawkin. Thundering Surf Water Park, the island&#x27;s only water park, offers fun for all ages. With six water slides, a kids&#x27; area, a lazy river, miniature golf, and a Flow House, the water park is a popular attraction for families.

Two significant commercial establishments are Schooner&#x27;s Wharf/Bay Village, in Beach Haven, and Viking Village, in Barnegat Light. The latter includes numerous family-owned shops generally oriented toward the local fishing industry and the many fishing charter boats that set sail there, though a variety of handmade crafts can also be found. The former is geared more specifically toward the tourism industry, featuring a variety of eateries and more mainstream shops. Across from the Thundering Surf Water Park, Bay Village began in 1965 when John Maschal purchased a half-block around his shop &quot;Country Kettle Fudge&quot; — which had opened four years earlier — and developed it into the existing shopping area. When Bay Village opened, it adjoined the Lucy Evelyn, a three-masted schooner that had been set on land and turned into a gift shop and museum. The Lucy Evelyn, 140&#x27; long with a 32&#x27; beam and 10&#x27; draft, built in 1917 in Harrington, Maine, burned to the ground in January 1972. It was replaced by a building that resembles a schooner. One of the original &quot;Seaman&#x27;s Shacks&quot; that surrounded the Lucy Evelyn still remains on the north-western outskirts of Bay Village. The annual Chowderfest clam chowder competition is held at Schooner&#x27;s Wharf/Bay Village in Beach Haven every October, drawing a significant influx of tourists during the off-season. For the past 20 years, island restaurants have competed in Manhattan and New England clam chowder categories. Recent winners include Stefano&#x27;s Pizza and Pasta, Howard&#x27;s Restaurant, Country Kettle Chowda, Buckalew&#x27;s Restaurant and Tavern, and the Black Whale Bar and Fish House.

During the winter months, episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values &lt; 0 °F (&lt; -18 °C). The plant hardiness zone at 9th St Beach, Ship Bottom is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 3.8 °F (-15.7 °C). The average seasonal (Nov-Apr) snowfall total is between , and the average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity.


===Ecology===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Long Beach Island, New Jersey would have a dominant vegetation type of Northern Cordgrass (&quot;73&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (&quot;20&quot;).

===Media===
 The SandPaper, an award-winning weekly newsmagazine published 50 weeks a year, has for several decades been the leading source of news coverage for communities on the island, as well as on the mainland, in addition to providing much in the way of cultural, historical and entertainment features and commentary.

&quot;The Press of Atlantic City&quot; provides daily news coverage of the towns, as does WPGG radio. The governments of the towns provide columns and commentary to &quot;The Southern Ocean Times&quot;, which is one of seven weekly papers from Micromedia Publications. There is also a website called LBI Eats, which is written by locals and shares island news, restaurant and bar reviews and details about the destination&#x27;s best features.

<text>Lincoln Loy McCandless (September 18, 1859 – October 5, 1940) was a United States cattle rancher, industrialist and politician for the Territory of Hawaii. McCandless served in the United States Congress as a territorial delegate. A former member of the Hawaii Republican Party, McCandless was one of the earliest leaders of the Hawaii Democratic Party.

==Life==
Born September 18, 1859, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, his mother was Eliza Ann Newman and father Thomas McCartney McCandless.
McCandless grew up in Volcano, West Virginia. McCandless moved to Hawaii in 1882 to employ his expertise in oil drilling and mining to construct artesian wells. He joined his older brothers James S. McCandless (born 1855) who had arrived in 1880, and John A. McCandless (born 1853) who had arrived in 1881, forming the McCandless Brothers family firm.
On May 24, 1904, he married Elizabeth Janet Cartwright of New York.

McCandless entered political life as a member of the Republic of Hawaii House of Representatives from the 5th district from 1898 to 1900.
After the United States annexed the islands to form the Territory of Hawaii, McCandless was elected to the territorial legislature as a senator from 1902 to 1906. He started his career in the Hawaii Republican Party. But by 1906, he started to challenge the long-serving Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana&#x27;ole.

By 1908 McCandless switched to join the Hawaii Democratic Party to oppose Kūhiō as non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives for Hawaii Territory&#x27;s at-large congressional district, 
He was also nominated in 1910, and in 1912, losing all those elections, but Democrat William Paul Jarrett was nominated and won the elections in 1922 and 1924.
McCandless was nominated and won the election on November 8, 1932, and served one term from March 4, 1933, to January 3, 1935. Losing a bid for reelection, McCandless directed the construction of roads, buildings, and a sewer system for Honolulu. He died in Honolulu, on October 5, 1940, and was cremated and interred in Oahu Cemetery in the Nuuanu Valley.

<text>The timeline of [[luminiferous aether]] (light-bearing aether) or ether as a medium for propagating electromagnetic radiation begins in the 18th century. The aether was assumed to exist for much of the 19th century—until the Michelson–Morley experiment returned its famous null result. Further experiments were in general agreement with Michelson and Morley&#x27;s result. By the 1920s, most scientists rejected the aether&#x27;s existence.

== Timeline ==

=== Antiquity ===
: 4th-century BC – Aristotle publishes &quot;Physics&quot;, in which the aether is briefly described as being an element lighter than air that surrounds celestial bodies. He describes the aether in relation to other elements – aether is lighter than air and is located above it, whereas air is lighter than water, and water is lighter than earth. In Aristotle&#x27;s view, each element returns to its proper place when displaced, which explains why air rises, why earth and water fall, and why the heavens remain in place.

=== Early experiments ===
:17th century: Robert Boyle was a proponent of an aether hypothesis. According to Boyle, the aether consists of subtle particles, one sort of which explains the absence of vacuum and the mechanical interactions between bodies, and the other sort of which explains phenomena such as magnetism (and possibly gravity) that are, otherwise, inexplicable on the basis of purely mechanical interactions of macroscopic bodies. 
: 1690 – Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Light&quot; hypothesized that light is a wave propagating through an aether.
: 1704 – Isaac Newton publishes &quot;Opticks&quot;, in which he proposes a particle theory of light. This had trouble explaining diffraction, so he adds a &quot;fudge factor,&quot; claiming that an &quot;Aethereal Medium&quot; is responsible for this effect, and going further to suggest it might be responsible for other physical effects such as heat.
: 1727 – James Bradley measures stellar aberration for the first time, proving (again) that light has a finite speed as well as that the Earth is moving.
: 1818 – Augustin Fresnel introduces the wave theory of light, which proposes light is a transverse wave travelling in an aether, thereby explaining how polarization can exist. It is important to note that both Newton&#x27;s particle theory and Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory both assume an aether exists, albeit for different reasons. From this point on, no one even seems to question its existence.
: 1820 – Discovery of Siméon Poisson&#x27;s &quot;Bright Spot&quot;, supporting the Wave Theory.
: 1830 – Fresnel develops a formula for predicting and measuring aether dragging by massive objects, based on a coupling constant. Such dragging seems to be at odds with aberration however, which would require the Earth &quot;not&quot; to drag the aether in order to be visible.
:: George Gabriel Stokes becomes a champion of the dragging theory.
: 1851 – Armand Fizeau carries out his famous experiment with light travelling through moving water. He measures fringing due to motion of the water, perfectly in line with Fresnel&#x27;s formula. However he sees no effect due to the motion of the Earth, although he does not comment on this. Nevertheless this is seen as very strong evidence for aether dragging.
: 1868 – Martinus Hoek carries out an improved version of Fizeau&#x27;s using an interferometer experiment with one arm in water. He sees no effect at all, and cannot offer an explanation as to why his experiment is so at odds with Fizeau&#x27;s.
: 1871 – George Biddell Airy re-runs Bradley&#x27;s experiment with a telescope filled with water. He too sees no effect. It appears that aether is &quot;not&quot; dragged by mass.
: 1873 – James Clerk Maxwell publishes his &quot;Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot;.
: 1879 – Maxwell suggests absolute velocity of Earth in aether may be optically detectable.
: 1881 – Albert Abraham Michelson publishes his first interferometer experiments, using the device for the measurement of extremely small distances. To Michelson&#x27;s dismay, his experiment finds no &quot;ether drag&quot; slowing light, as had been suggested by Fresnel.
:: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz finds Michelson&#x27;s calculation have errors (i.e., doubling of the expected fringe shift error).
: 1882 – Michelson acknowledges his interpretation errors.

===Crisis===
: 1887 – the Michelson–Morley experiment (MMX) produces the famous null result. A small drift is seen, but it is too small to support any &quot;fixed&quot; aether theory, and is so small that it might be due to experimental error.
:: Many physicists dust off Stokes&#x27; work, and dragging becomes the &quot;standard solution&quot;
: 1887 to 1888 – Heinrich Hertz verifies the existence of electromagnetic waves.
: 1889 – George FitzGerald proposes the Contraction Hypothesis, which suggests that the measurements are null due to changes in the length in the direction of travel through the aether.
: 1892 – Oliver Lodge demonstrates that aether drag is invisible around rapidly moving celestial bodies.
: 1895 – Lorentz proposes independently the Contraction Hypothesis.
: 1902 to 1904 – Morley and Morley conduct a number of MM experiments with a 100 ft interferometer, producing the null result.
: 1902 to 1904 – Lord Rayleigh and DeWitt Bristol Brace found no signs of double refraction (due to FitzGerald–Lorentz Contraction) of moving bodies in the aether.
: 1903 – the Trouton–Noble experiment, based on an entirely different concept using electrical forces, also produces the null result 
: 1905 – Miller and Morley&#x27;s experiment data is published. Test of the Contraction Hypothesis has negative results. Test for aether dragging effects produces null result.
: 1908 – the Trouton–Rankine experiment, another experiment based on electrical effects, does not detect the FitzGerald–Lorentz Contraction.

===Change===
: 1904 – Hendrik Lorentz publishes a new theory of moving bodies, without discarding the stationary (electromagnetic) ether concept.
: 1905 – Henri Poincaré shows that Lorentz&#x27;s theory fulfills the principle of relativity, and publishes the Lorentz transformations. His model was still based on Lorentz&#x27;s ether, but he argues that this aether is perfectly undetectable.
: 1905 – Albert Einstein publishes an observationally equivalent theory, but complete with a derivation from principles alone (leaving the ether aside). Einstein also emphasized that this concept implies the relativity of space and time. He later labelled it special relativity.
: 1908 – Trouton–Rankine experiment shows that length contraction of an object according to one frame does not produce a measurable change of resistance in the object&#x27;s rest frame
: 1913 – Georges Sagnac uses a rotating MMX device and receives a clearly positive result. The so-called Sagnac effect was considered excellent evidence for aether at the time, but was later explained via general relativity. Good explanations based on SR also exist.
: 1914 – Walther Zurhellen uses observations of binary stars to determine if the speed of light is dependent on movement of the source. His measurements show that it is not to 10−6. This is claimed to be additional evidence against aether dragging.
: 1915 – Einstein publishes on the general theory of relativity.
: 1919 – Arthur Eddington&#x27;s Africa eclipse expedition is conducted and appears to confirm the general theory of relativity.
: 1920 – Einstein says that special relativity does not require rejecting the aether, and that the gravitational field of general relativity may be called aether, to which no state of motion can be attributed.
: 1921 – Dayton Miller conducts aether drift experiments at Mount Wilson. Miller performs tests with insulated and non-magnetic interferometers and obtains positive results.
: 1921 to 1924 – Miller conducts extensive tests under controlled conditions at Case University.
: 1924 – Miller repeats his experiments at Mount Wilson and yields a positive result.
:: Rudolf Tomaschek uses stars for his interferometer light source, getting the null result.
: 1925 – the Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment produces a positive result while attempting to detect the effect of Earth&#x27;s rotation on the velocity of light. The significance of the experiment remains debated to this day, but this planetary Sagnac effect is measured by ring laser gyros and taken into account by the GPS system.
: 1925 April – Meeting of the National Academy of Sciences.
:: Arthur Compton explains the problems with the Stokes aether drag solution.
:: Miller presents his positive results of the aether drag.
: 1925 December – American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting.
:: Miller proposes two theories to account for the positive result. One consists of a modified aether theory, the other a slight departure from the Contraction Hypothesis.
: 1926 – Roy J. Kennedy produces a null result on Mount Wilson
:: Auguste Piccard and Ernest Stahel produce a null result on Mont Rigi.
: 1927 – Mount Wilson conference.
:: Miller talks of partial entrainment
:: Michelson talks about aether drag and altitude differential effects
:: K. K. Illingworth produces a null result using a clever version of the MMX with a step in one mirror that dramatically improves resolution. The resolution is so good that most partial entrainment systems can be eliminated.
: 1929 – Michelson and F. G. Pease perform the Pearson experiment and produce a null result.
: 1930 – Georg Joos produces a null result using an extremely accurate interferometer placed entirely in vacuum.
: 1932 – the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment uses an interferometer with arms of different lengths and not at right angles. They measure over several seasons and record on photographs to allow better post-measurement study. The Kennedy Thorndike experiment becomes one of the fundamental tests for SR, proving the independence of light speed wrt to the speed of the emitting source. The other two fundamental tests are Michelson–Morley experiment (proves light speed isotropy) and Ives–Stilwell experiment (proves time dilation)
: 1934 – Georg Joos publishes on the Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment, stating that it is improbable that aether would be entrained by translational motion and not by rotational motion.
: 1935 – Hammar experiment disproves aether entrainment
: 1951 – Paul Dirac writes that currently-accepted quantum field theory requires an aether, although he never formulated this theory completely.

===Debate slows===
: 1955 – R. S. Shankland, S. W. McCuskey, F. C. Leone, and G. Kuerti performed an analysis of Miller&#x27;s results and explained them as stemming from systematic errors (Shankland&#x27;s explanation is now widely accepted).
: 1958 – Cedarholm, Havens, and Townes use two masers frequency locked to each other and send the light in two directions. They receive the null result. The experiment is not as precise as earlier light-based MMX experiments, but demonstrates a novel setup that would become much more accurate in the future.
: 1964 – Jaseja, Javan, Murray and Townes repeat the earlier experiment with newer and much more precise masers.
: 1969 – Shamir and Fox repeat the MMX experiment with the &quot;arms&quot; in acrylic glass waveguides and a highly stable laser as the source. The experiment should detect a shift as small as ~0.00003 of a fringe, and none is measured.
: 1972 – R. S. Shankland admits he would not likely have given the effort to question Dayton Miller&#x27;s work had it not been for Albert Einstein&#x27;s &quot;interest and encouragement.&quot;
: 1973 – Trimmer finds a null result in a triangular interferometer with one leg in glass.
: 1977 – Brecher repeats Zurhellen&#x27;s experiment with binary pulsars, showing no difference in light speed to 2*10−9 
: 1979 Brillet and Hall use the Townes setup with highly accurate lasers, demonstrating no drift to 3 parts in 1015. The experiment also demonstrates a leftover 17 Hz signal, but the authors assume it is linked to the laboratory.
: 1984 – Torr and Kolen find a cyclic phase shift between two atomic clocks, but the distance between is relatively short (0.5 km) and they are clocks of the less-precise rubidium type
: 1988 – Gagnon et al. measure one way light speed and detect no anisotropy
: 1990 – Hils and Hall repeat the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment with lasers, taking measurements over the period of a year. They find no shifting in 2 10−13

: Krisher et al., Phys. Rev. D, 42, No. 2, pp. 731–734, (1990) use two hydrogen masers fixed to the earth and separated by a 21 km fiber-optic link to look for variations in the phase between them. They put an upper limit on the one-way linear anisotropy of 100 m/s.
: 1991 – Over a six-month period, Roland DeWitte finds, over a 1.5 km underground coaxial cable, a cyclic component in the phase drift between higher-precision caesium-beam clocks on more-or-less the same meridian; the period equals the sidereal day

<text>Lars Sven &quot;Lasse&quot; Hallström (; born 2 June 1946) is a Swedish film director. He first became known for directing almost all the music videos by the pop group ABBA, but came to international attention with his 1985 feature film &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. He is also known for &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (1993), &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (1999), and &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000).

==Early life and education==
Lars Sven &quot;Lasse&quot; Hallström was born on 2 June 1946 in Stockholm, Sweden. His father was a dentist and keen amateur videographer; his mother was the author and poet Karin Lyberg.
He attended Adolf Fredrik&#x27;s Music School in Stockholm, where he made his first music video and 8 mm films.

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Hallström worked as a director of short pop music clips at Sveriges Television.

He made his directorial debut in 1973, directing the comedy series &quot;Pappas pojkar&quot; for Swedish TV. He frequently collaborated with comic actors Magnus Härenstam and Brasse Brännström during his Swedish period.

Between 1974 and 1982, Hallström worked with the Swedish group ABBA on many of their music videos and also directed their 1977 film &quot;&quot;. Almost all of ABBA&#x27;s promotional films were directed and shot by Hallström, with only seven exceptions: &quot;When I Kissed the Teacher&quot; (1977); &quot;Chiquitita&quot; (1979), which was made by the BBC; &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; (1979); &quot;On and On and On&quot; (1980); &quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot; (1981); &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot; (1982), and &quot;Under Attack&quot; (1982), the latter two being directed by Kjell Sundvall and Kjell-Åke Andersson. 

After the international success of &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot; (1985), Hallström started working in Hollywood. His first English-language film was &quot;Once Around&quot;, but his first notable English-language success was &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (1993), starring Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. 

Hallström made a number of successful film adaptations from novels. In 1999, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; was released. He followed that success the following year by directing &quot;Chocolat&quot;, starring Johnny Depp, Juliette Binoche, and Judi Dench, which was a critical and box-office success. His 2001 film &quot;The Shipping News&quot; was adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by E. Annie Proulx and starred Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, Julianne Moore, and Cate Blanchett.

His 2011 film &quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot;, based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Paul Torday and starred Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt.

His 2017 film, &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Purpose&quot;, based on the 2010 novel of the same name, was billed as &quot;a celebration of the special connection between humans and their dogs&quot;.

Hallström directed and executive produced the 2024 American-Icelandic Nordic Noir thriller television series &quot;The Darkness&quot;, starring his wife Lena Olin, who has collaborated with him on other films.

<text>Montastraea is a genus of colonial stony coral found in the Caribbean seas. It is the only genus in the monotypic family Montastraeidae and contains a single species, Montastraea cavernosa, known as great star coral. It forms into massive boulders and sometimes develops into plates. Its polyps are the size of a human thumb and fully extend at night.

==Description==

Great star coral colonies form massive boulders and domes over 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter in waters of shallow and moderate depths. In deeper waters, this coral has been observed growing as a plate formation. It is found throughout most reef environments, and is the predominant coral at depths of 40–100 feet (12.2–30.5 m).

This coral occasionally has a fluorescent red or orange color during daytime; it has recently been suggested that this hue is due to phycoerythrin, a cyanobacterial protein. It appears that, in addition to symbiotic zooxanthella, this coral harbors endocellular symbiotic cyanobacteria, possibly to help it fix nitrogen. However more recently, Oswold &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) showed an absence of functional phycoerythrin in &quot;M. cavernosa&quot;.

The species is gonochoric (colonies can be either male or female) and spawns one week after the full moon in late August. Skeletons show sex-related differences, with females having a less dense skeleton compared to males, which is presumably due to reallocating energy to egg production.

==Bleaching==
The distinction of bleaching in reefs of &quot;M. cavernosa&quot; from merely white-coloured corals was shown to be difficult using standard reflectance techniques. A survey in the Bay of All Saints concluded that this may lead to nearly two-fold overestimation of bleaching.

<text>165 University Avenue or Lucky Building or Karma Building is a small rented office building on University Avenue, the main commercial street in downtown Palo Alto, California, that gave rise to Plug and Play Tech Center and to the Amidi Group. It is run by Rahim &amp; Saeed Amidi, whose family fled from the Iranian revolution in the 1970s. Located near Stanford University, the building has served as an incubator for several noted Silicon Valley companies, including Logitech, Google, PayPal, Danger, Inc (bought by Microsoft), BridgeBio Pharma, BetterWorks, Milo.com (bought by eBay), WePay (acquired by J.P. Morgan) and Yummly (bought by Whirlpool). YouTube also provides this location as the example address when setting the location of an uploaded video. Until 2000, the ground floor was home to a Palo Alto institution, Chimaera Books &amp; Music. Like many independent bookstores, its closure was due, in part, to competition from the dot com economy.

<text>Andrew Hendy was a Hereditary Chief of the Mosquito Reservation.

He was proclaimed by the Nicaraguans on the death of his cousin George V, who died on 8 November 1888. He was repudiated by many people of the Miskitu Nation and abdicated in favour of his cousin Jonathan I, on 8 March 1889. He retired to Nicaraguan territory where he became a Miskitu Jefe Inspector and River Magistrate. He was subsequently chosen as a rival Chief by General Rigoberto Cabezas who deposed Robert Henry Clarence in 1894. He was reappointed for the third time and formally installed at the Government Palace, Bluefields, on 20 November 1894. He was later accepted as chief by his own relatives and others who resided around the Wangki River within traditional Nicaraguan territory, but was opposed by the vast majority, who saw him as a Nicaraguan stooge and rebelled against him in 1896, 1899 and 1900.

<text>is a historical Japanese derogatory term for renegade local clans, and also the name for a race of spider-like in Japanese folklore. Alternative names for the mythological &quot;Tsuchigumo&quot; include and . In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and in &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the name was phonetically spelled with the four kanji (for the four morae &quot;tsu-chi-gu-mo&quot;), and these words were frequently used in the of Mutsu Province, Echigo Province, Hitachi Province, Settsu Province, Bungo Province and Hizen Province as well as others.

The name is believed to be derived from . means &quot;earth&quot; and means &quot;hiding&quot;. The word is thought to have referred to a local clan of powerful people who did not obey the imperial court and lived in caves. As a local clan, the were described as short in stature but long in limbs, with the temperament of a wolf and the heart of an owl, and living an uncivilized life.

Historian Sōkichi Tsuda (ja) points out that unlike Kumaso and Emishi, is not treated as a group in the , but as an individual name. The historian Yoshiyuki Takioto (ja) also deduces that the were local chieftains with shamanism as their power background from the fact that the in the of Kyushu appear as sorcerers related to agriculture who appease angry .

The giant spider-like figure of the as a -like first appeared in medieval literary works. The most representative work among these tales is &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, compiled in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) in the first half of the 13th century, in which it appears under the name . As the passed through the ages, it became a more bizarre-looking . In the 14th-century , the is depicted as a giant 60 meters long, and when it was exterminated, 1990 heads of the dead came out of its belly. Minamoto no Yorimitsu and Watanabe no Tsuna, who participated in the extermination of the in these stories, are legendary heroes in Japan; they also appear in the legend of the powerful . The as a also appeared as the subject of Noh, Jōruri and Kabuki plays.

==In history==
===Tsuchigumo of the Katsuragi===
Of the clans referred to as tsuchigumo, those of the Mount Yamato Katsuragi are particularly well known. was said to be the remains where Emperor Jimmu captured tsuchigumo and buried their head, body and feet separately to prevent their grudges from harming the living.

In historic Yamato Province, the unique physical characteristics of the tsuchigumo were that they were tailed people. In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the founder of the Yoshino no Futo (吉野首) were written to be &quot;with a glowing tail,&quot; the founder of Yoshino no Kuzu (国樔) were stated to &quot;have tails and come along pushing rocks (磐石, iwa),&quot; presenting the indigenous people of Yamato as non-humans. Even in the Kojiki, they shared a common trait with the people of Osaka (忍坂) (now Sakurai city) in that they were &quot;tsuchigumo (土雲) who have grown tails.&quot;

===Records from the Keiko generation and others===
In the &quot;Hizen no Kuni Fudoki&quot;, there is an article writing that when Emperor Keiko made an imperial visit to Shiki island (志式島, Hirado island) (year 72 in the legends), the expedition encountered a pair of islands in the middle of sea. Seeing smoke rising from inland, the Emperor ordered an investigation of the islands, and discovered that the tsuchigumo Oomimi (大耳) lived on the smaller island, and Taremimi (垂耳) lived on the larger island. When both were captured and about to be killed, Oomimi and Taremimi lowered their foreheads to the ground and fell prostrate, and pleaded, &quot;we will from now on make offerings to the emperor&quot; and presented fish products and begged for pardon.

Also, in the &quot;Bungo no Kuni Fudoki&quot;, there appeared many tsuchigumo, such as the Itsuma-hime (五馬姫) of Itsuma mountain (五馬山), the Uchisaru (打猴), Unasaru (頸猴), Yata (八田), Kunimaro (國摩侶), and Amashino (網磯野), of Negi field (禰宜野), the Shinokaomi (小竹鹿臣) of Shinokaosa (小竹鹿奥), and the Ao (青) and Shiro (白) of Nezumi cavern (鼠の磐窟). Other than these, there is also the story of Tsuchigumo Yasome (土蜘蛛八十女), who made preparations in the mountains to resist against the imperial court, but was utterly defeated. This word &quot;Yaso&quot; (八十), literally &quot;eighty,&quot; is a figurative term for &quot;many,&quot; so this story is interpreted to mean that many of the female chief class opposed the Yamato imperial court, and met a heroic end, choosing to die alongside their men. In the story, Yaso, one local female chief, was greatly popular among the people, and she separated her allies from those resisting the imperial forces. Tsuchigumo Yasome&#x27;s whereabouts were reported to the emperor, and for her efforts she was spared.

According to writings in the Nihon Shoki, in the 12th year of emperor Keiko (year 82 in the legends), in winter, October, emperor Keiko arrived in Hayami town, Ookita (now Ooita), and heard from the queen of the land, Hayatsuhime (速津媛) that there was a big cave in the mountain, called the Nezumi cave, where two tsuchigumo, Shiro and Ao, lived. In Negino (禰疑野), Naoiri, they were informed of three more tsuchigumo named Uchizaru (打猿), Yata (八田), and Kunimaro (国摩侶, 国麻呂). These five had great amount of allies, and would not follow the emperor&#x27;s commands.

==Yōkai tsuchigumo==


From the Japanese middle ages (Kamakura/Muromachi/Azuchi-Momoyama periods, or the late 12th to the early 17th centuries) onward, &quot;tsuchigumo&quot; began to be depicted as giant, monstrous spiders.

A commonly cited early text depicting the &quot;yōkai tsuchigumo&quot; is &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, or rather some variant texts of the &quot;Heike&quot;. This work, which was passed down orally among &quot;biwa&quot; lute players, has a complicated textual history and numerous variants, including the massively expanded &quot;Genpei Jōsuiki&quot;, and some versions include an extended passage on swords, known as the &quot;Sword Scroll&quot;, or &quot;tsurugi-no-maki&quot;. This is regarded as one of the most important and influential texts that depict the conflict between Yorimitsu and the &quot;tsuchigumo&quot;, and is the source for many later artistic representations. It describes Yorimitsu&#x27;s using the sword to defeat a &quot;yamagumo&quot;, which led to his renaming it &#x27;Kumokiri&#x27; (蜘蛛切, &quot;Spider-Cutter&quot;). At present, Daikaku-ji Temple, Hakone Shrine and an individual, have &quot;tachi&quot; that have been handed down as &quot;Hizamaru&quot;, which are also called by other names such as &#x27;Kumokiri&#x27;, &#x27;Hoemaru&#x27; and &#x27;Usumidori&#x27; based on various legends.

Works such as the 14th-century picture scroll &quot;Tsuchigumo Sōshi&quot; and the 15th-century Noh drama &quot;Tsuchigumo&quot; envision various versions of a legend in which Minamoto no Yorimitsu, also known as Raikō, a famous 10th-century general and ancestor of the Minamoto clan defeat an enormous spider &quot;yōkai&quot; referred to as a &quot;tsuchigumo&quot; or &quot;yamagumo&quot; (&quot;earth spider&quot; or &quot;mountain spider&quot;, respectively). In some versions, Yorimitsu and his retainer Watanabe no Tsuna pursue the spider, which takes various forms such as a beautiful woman, and when they defeat it they cut it open and skulls pour out of its torso, while in others, Yorimitsu is incapacitated and a young retainer hunts the spider down in his stead.

&quot;Tsuchigumo Sōshi&quot; (see scrolling image below) interestingly contains a visual depiction that doesn&#x27;t appear to match the accompanying text, as the text has Yorimitsu and Tsuna take down an enormous, 60-foot monster that they later realize is a giant spider, but the imagery shows them doing battle with two &quot;oni&quot;, or ogre-demons, resembling Gozu and Mezu, which perhaps represent another of the &quot;tsuchigumo&quot;″s transformations.

<doc id="904622" wikidata="Q1562040" url="?curid=904622" title="Play for Today">
<text>Play for Today is a British television anthology drama series, produced by the BBC and transmitted on BBC1 from 1970 to 1984. During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original television plays, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were (with a few exceptions noted below) between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, subsequently became television series in their own right.

==History==
The strand was a successor to &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;, the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission moved to Thursday to make way for a sport programme. Some works, screened in anthology series on BBC2, like Willy Russell&#x27;s &quot;Our Day Out&quot; (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;, Graeme MacDonald and Irene Shubik, transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973 while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Kenith Trodd (1973–1982), David Rose (1972–1980), Innes Lloyd (1975–1982), Margaret Matheson (1977–1979), Sir Richard Eyre (1978–1980), and Pharic MacLaren (1974–1982).

Plays covered all genres. In its time, &quot;Play for Today&quot; featured contemporary social realist dramas, historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction (&quot;The Flipside of Dominick Hide&quot;, 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.

Writers who contributed plays to the series included Ian McEwan, John Osborne, Dennis Potter, Stephen Poliakoff, Sir David Hare, Willy Russell, Alan Bleasdale, Arthur Hopcraft, Alan Plater, Graham Reid, David Storey, Andrew Davies, Rhys Adrian and John Hopkins.

Several prominent directors also featured, including Stephen Frears, Alan Clarke, Michael Apted, Mike Newell, Roland Joffé, Ken Loach, Lindsay Anderson, and Mike Leigh. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include &quot;Edna, the Inebriate Woman&quot; (1971), &quot;The Foxtrot&quot; (1971), &quot;Home&quot; (1972), &quot;The Fishing Party&quot; (1972), &quot;Bar Mitzvah Boy&quot; (1976), &quot;The Other Woman&quot; (1976), &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; (1977), &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; (1979) and &quot;Just a Boys&#x27; Game&quot; (1979). Certain other plays, including &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot; (1974) and &quot;Nuts in May&quot; (1976), were commissioned by David Rose of the BBC&#x27;s English Regions Drama department based in Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham.

Some installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series, including &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, which was produced as a one-off in the &quot;Play for Today&quot; strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for Thames Television, again with Leo McKern. Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;The Black Stuff&quot;, was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;. It was never part of the &quot;Play For Today&quot; strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.

Other offshoots were &quot;Gangsters&quot;, &quot;Headmaster&quot;, and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as &quot;Play for Tomorrow&quot;. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by Graham Reid. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred Kenneth Branagh as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from RADA.

There were also some groups of plays transmitted that – for various reasons – did not go out under the &quot;Play for Today&quot; banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the &quot;Play for Today&quot; canon.

Several plays were BAFTA award winners. John Le Mesurier and Patricia Hayes were named Best Actor and Actress, respectively, for their roles in the 1971 series &quot;Traitor&quot; and &quot;Edna, The Inebriate Woman&quot;, the latter also being named Best Drama Production. Dame Celia Johnson was named Best Actress for &quot;Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont&quot;, broadcast in 1973. &quot;Stocker&#x27;s Copper&quot; (1972), &quot;Kisses At Fifty&quot; (1973), &quot;Bar Mitzvah Boy&quot; (1976), &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend!&quot; (1977), &quot;Licking Hitler&quot; (1978), and &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; (1979) were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.

Videotapes of thirty-seven of the episodes produced between 1970 and 1975 were wiped after transmission, and no copies of many of them are known to exist.

Two plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;Brimstone &amp; Treacle&quot; in 1976 and Roy Minton&#x27;s &quot;Scum&quot; the following year. In the case of &quot;Brimstone &amp; Treacle&quot; it was due to concerns over the play&#x27;s depiction of a disabled woman&#x27;s rape at the hands of a man who may possibly have been the devil, and with &quot;Scum&quot; the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a borstal. &quot;Scum&quot; and &quot;Brimstone &amp; Treacle&quot; were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films. Another play &quot;Pillion&quot; recorded in 1979 was never broadcast.

One play, &quot;The Other Woman&quot;, generated some mild controversy for its &quot;graphic depiction&quot; of lesbianism, and for the onscreen kiss between Jane Lapotaire and Lynne Frederick.

==Demise and legacy==
After fourteen series and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in August 1984, although two series of single dramas without &quot;Play for Today&quot; billing were broadcast on BBC1 in a similar time slot from July to December 1983 and from November 1984 to February 1985. Thereafter the strand of single dramas became &quot;Screen Two&quot; on BBC2 from January 1985, and later also &quot;Screen One&quot; on BBC1 from September 1989. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as Film on Four on Channel 4, they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama&#x27;s roots in the theatre that &quot;Play for Today&quot; and earlier series on both the BBC and ITV had often demonstrated.

Nonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the British Film Institute produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from &quot;Play for Today&quot;.

A new programme publicised as a return of &quot;Play for Today&quot;, but under the working title of &quot;The Evening Play&quot;, was announced at the beginning of March 2006, but nothing has been heard from it since. Kevin Spacey, film star and director of the Old Vic, in March 2008 told BBC News that he would like to see the return of the show,
but the journalists Michael Gove and Mark Lawson expressed disagreement, Gove (by then a Conservative MP) describing them as &quot;exercises in viewer patronisation&quot;. Jan Moir in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote in support of Spacey, saying &quot;the British loved &quot;Play for Today&quot; once, and would do so again. A good piece of drama looks at the human condition, and tells us something we should know about ourselves.&quot;

A book detailing the origins of the series, &quot;Play for Today: The First Year&quot; by Simon Farquhar, was published in 2021.

==Productions==
The following list was sourced according to the BBC Genome archive of &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazines. Titles that carried the tag &quot;Play For Today&quot; on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats such as the repeat of the &quot;Days of Hope&quot; quartet, where the initial broadcast was not branded &quot;Play for Today&quot;, but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1, except for the delayed broadcast of &quot;Scum&quot; in 1991 which was broadcast on BBC2.

Some early episodes are missing or no longer exist in colour.


==Home media==
The BFI have released three box sets of the series on Blu-ray, each consisting of various plays from throughout the show&#x27;s run.

<doc id="904623" wikidata="Q983933" url="?curid=904623" title="Damageplan">
<text>Damageplan was an American heavy metal band from Dallas, Texas, formed in 2003. Following the demise of their previous group Pantera, brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul Abbott wanted to start a new band. The pair recruited former Halford guitarist Patrick Lachman on vocals, and later Bob Zilla on bass. Damageplan released &quot;New Found Power&quot;, their only album, in February 2004. &quot;New Found Power&quot; debuted at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 44,676 copies in its first week.

While Damageplan was promoting the album at a concert on December 8, 2004 at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio, deranged fan Nathan Gale climbed on stage and killed guitarist Dimebag Darrell and three others before being fatally shot by a police officer. Although no motive was found, some of Gale&#x27;s friends reported that he believed that Pantera had stolen his lyrics and that its former members were attempting to steal his identity. Damageplan&#x27;s manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has been inactive since the incident. Vinnie and Zilla joined the band Hellyeah, and Lachman joined the Mercy Clinic. Vinnie Paul died in 2018.

== History ==
===Formation===
By 2003, drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell were plagued with difficulties that their previous metal band, Pantera, was experiencing. Both described the performance level of Pantera&#x27;s vocalist, Phil Anselmo, as &quot;hit and miss, depending on what type of chemicals he was on&quot;. Following the release of Pantera&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; and the subsequent tour, Anselmo and bassist Rex Brown started to focus on their side projects, and remained out of contact with the brothers, affecting their ability to write or record any future Pantera material. Both Abbott brothers eventually chose to move on from Pantera, as they began writing new material on their own.

A demo of the song &quot;Crawl&quot; was sent to former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman who auditioned as vocalist. Lachman was hired, and New Found Power was formed in early 2003 with former Jerry Cantrell guitarist Shawn Matthews on bass initially, who was replaced after the album recording with the brothers&#x27; tattoo artist, Bob Zilla. When writing music, Paul claimed; &quot;we put no boundaries on it ... we wanted it to be very diverse&quot;, and Darrell said &quot;We wanted to stretch out and expand our capabilities to their fullest.&quot; The band changed its name to Damageplan and decided to name the first album &quot;New Found Power&quot;.

===&quot;New Found Power&quot;===
The single &quot;Save Me&quot; debuted on American radio on January 26, 2004, and the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;New Found Power&quot;, was released in the United States on February 10. The album was recorded at the brothers&#x27; backyard studio, Chasin&#x27; Jason, in Arlington, Texas, where previous Pantera albums were also recorded. The Abbott brothers found out that during recording, everyone was willing to contribute and &quot;put 100% effort into it&quot; while with Pantera, but they found it too difficult to have Anselmo in the recording studio. Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society, and Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains made guest appearances on the tracks &quot;Fuck You&quot;, &quot;Soul Bleed&quot;, and the bonus track &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; respectively, and Sterling Winfield handled co-production duties.

&quot;New Found Power&quot; sold 44,676 copies in its first week to debut at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album received mixed reviews from music critics; Christine Klunk of PopMatters commented &quot;I&#x27;m not in the least bit interested in where this band goes or what new and exciting ways they&#x27;ll think of to abuse the listeners,&quot; while Johnny Loftus of AllMusic felt it was a &quot;blazing new beginning&quot;.

Alice in Chains&#x27; vocalist/guitarist Jerry Cantrell attended a Thanksgiving party hosted by the Abbott brothers. Darrell and Paul had a demo of the first song they wrote, titled &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;. Lachman insisted that it was on the &quot;backburner&quot; until Cantrell showed interest. The band entered the Abbott brothers&#x27; backyard studio with Cantrell to record &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;. Although the song was not completed in time to be featured on &quot;New Found Power&quot;, it was included on the Japanese version, and for the soundtrack &quot;The Punisher: The Album&quot;. To promote &quot;New Found Power&quot;, the band toured with Hatebreed, Drowning Pool, and Unearth on the second installment of the Headbangers Ball.

===Death of Dimebag Darrell===

On December 8, 2004, the band was on a tour at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. Moments into the concert, Nathan Gale, a deranged 25-year-old fan, climbed onto the stage, drew a 9 mm Beretta 92FS, and shot Dimebag Darrell five times in the head, killing him. The band&#x27;s head of security Jeffery &quot;Mayhem&quot; Thompson then engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Gale, which allowed Paul and other members to escape. However, Thompson was shot and killed in the ensuing struggle. A fan named Nathan Bray, who attempted to give CPR to Thompson and Darrell, and Erin Halk, a U.S. Marine-turned-roadie who tried to disarm Gale while he was reloading, were both shot and killed as well. Once the police arrived, Columbus Police officer James Niggemeyer approached the stage from behind, and saw Gale holding his weapon to a hostage. Niggemeyer shot Gale once in the head with a 12-gauge Remington Model 870, killing him instantly. Fifteen shots were fired by Gale, and an additional 36 rounds were found in his possession.

A police investigation did not find any motive behind the shooting, although Gale&#x27;s mother stated that he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and that he believed the Abbott brothers had stolen his lyrics while trying to steal his identity. She was unaware if her son took the medication he was given for his condition, but was proud of his military service following his discharge, and had given him the weapon that was used in the shooting. Major Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps spokesman at The Pentagon, was unable to comment on Gale&#x27;s discharge.

A foundation called The Dimebag Darrell Memorial Fund was founded after the incident, which donated its profits to cover medical expenses of drum technician John Brooks and tour manager Chris Paluska, who were among those injured during the shooting. A public memorial service for Darrell took place on December 14, 2004 at Arlington Convention Center in Arlington, Texas. Many musicians paid tribute to Darrell on message boards and at live performances.

In May 2005, Niggemeyer was called before a grand jury, which was convened by the Franklin County prosecutor&#x27;s office to examine the actions taken on the night of Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s demise, a standard practice when deadly force is used. The jury found that there was no wrongdoing on Niggemeyer&#x27;s part. Franklin County prosecutor Ron O&#x27;Brien commented, &quot;There was little doubt [the shooting] was lawful, given the 200 eyewitnesses and the circumstances that surrounded the shooting. Nevertheless, we still have an independent body review the facts&quot;. Niggemeyer was nominated for a bravery award on the TV show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.

===Aftermath===
In a 2005 interview, Damageplan manager Paul Bassman said that unreleased recordings before Darrell&#x27;s death were near completion. He commented, &quot;Vinnie Paul has said there will be a follow-up album down the road, as Dime would have wanted his music to be heard.&quot; Rumors circulated of another album, although nothing has been released.

Following the events since Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s death, Paul was unsure if he wanted to continue playing music. He was invited to join the band called Hellyeah, which included members of Mudvayne and Nothingface, but declined the offer. However, bassist Jerry repeatedly called Paul, and he accepted the offer to join the project as he thought &quot;Everybody had their head in the right place.&quot; Hellyeah released its debut album on April 10, 2007. One week later, Zilla joined the band as its new bassist, after left due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;. The album was recorded at Abbott&#x27;s backyard studio, Chasin&#x27; Jason, where &quot;New Found Power&quot; was also recorded.

Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided the grieving process. He commented, &quot;you have to get back on the horse. You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything. I&#x27;m happy to have walked away with my life after the situation I was thrown into. But, I mean, what do you do? I&#x27;m a musician. I&#x27;m going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, &#x27;You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.&#x27; So, that&#x27;s what I did.&quot; Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo stated in the December 2004 edition of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; that Dimebag &quot;deserves to be severely beaten&quot;. He apologized and said the &quot;severely beaten&quot; comment was a joke, although Paul requested &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; to provide the audio tapes to discern the nature of the comments. Paul concluded that the quote was not a joke and referred to Anselmo as the &quot;master of lies&quot;.

A book titled &quot;A Vulgar Display of Power: Courage and Carnage at the Alrosa Villa&quot; was penned by author Chris Armold. For 14 months, Armold interviewed people and researched the events leading up to December 8, stating &quot;It&#x27;s not a book about rock stars, but heroes, regular guys who made the ultimate sacrifice.&quot; In his research, Armold found no evidence that the comments Anselmo made before Darrell&#x27;s death had influenced Gale&#x27;s actions. The book was released in 2007.

In a 2017 interview with Loudwire, Paul had stated that he had planned to release all unreleased Damageplan recordings at some point in the future, many of which have no vocals. He even stated having some of Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s favorite musicians, such as Rob Halford of Judas Priest to record vocals for the songs.

Vinnie Paul died on June 22, 2018, at the age of 54.

==Lyrical themes and style==
According to Johnny Loftus of AllMusic, Damageplan incorporated elements of traditional heavy metal, post-grunge, metalcore, and death metal. Damageplan&#x27;s sound has been described as groove metal, nu metal and thrash metal.

The lyrical process was a collaborative effort consisting of Paul, Darrell, and Lachman. Themes explored on the album included the brothers&#x27; experiences, Darrell commented, &quot;the crumbling of one empire and then starting over ... So there are a lot of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new.&quot; This is exemplified in the songs &quot;Reborn&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, and &quot;Breathing New Life&quot;. &quot;Blunt Force Trauma&quot; is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it, &quot;it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle&quot;.

When writing music, the Abbott brothers suggested guitar riffs and &quot;grooves&quot;, while Lachman added his input to modify the song&#x27;s structure. The band&#x27;s sound has been described by music critics to be similar to Pantera. Christine Klunk of &quot;PopMatters&quot; disliked the similarities and commented, &quot;aside from a constant, driving rhythm, repetitive riffs, and unintelligible lyrics about (I&#x27;m assuming) kicking ass—there&#x27;s nothing of interest to pay attention to&quot;. The song &quot;Breathing New Life&quot; features 180 beats-per-minute bass drum pedaling, what Vik Bansal of MusicOMH described as &quot;exploding into a blaze of riffage and a cool chorus&quot;. Bansal was impressed with certain elements of the song such as the switch from downbeat singing to &quot;a big chorus lodged in power chord heaven&quot;, and the incorporated groove rhythms. However, he felt Dimebag &quot;borrow[ed]&quot; Anthrax&#x27;s guitar solo from the song &quot;Only&quot;.

<doc id="904624" wikidata="Q13156645" url="?curid=904624" title="Mundu">
<text>The mundu (Malayalam: ; ) is a garment worn around the waist in the Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, the Lakshadweep archipelago, and the Indian Ocean island nation of Maldives. It is closely related to sarongs like dhotis and lungis. It is normally woven in cotton and coloured white or cream. The colour is dependent on whether the cotton is bleached or unbleached. A is made using handlooms. When unbleached, the mundu is called . In modern times, two types of mundu are prevalent—the single and the double. A single mundu is wrapped only once around the waist, while the double one is folded in half before wearing. A mundu is usually starched before use.

==Men==
A mundu usually has a line of comparatively thicker cloth woven into it near the border called the &quot;kara&quot;. The &quot;kara&quot; can be coloured and comes in various sizes. There is also double coloured and ornamental &quot;kara&quot; (a strip of colour at the end of the mundu). For more ceremonial occasions (like weddings), a mundu has a golden embroidery known as kasavu. The wearer highlights the &#x27;kara&#x27; by carefully folding the end of the mundu.
Unspoken rules of etiquette govern the way the mundu is worn. Men belonging to Islam should wear the mundu facing right side (kara facing right side) and Christian or Atheist men need to wear it kara facing in the middle.Mundu is compulsory in Hindu culture especially when Hindu men are entering into a Goddess Temple.Also Muslim men prefer to wear mundu with different colours of Kara while its a compulsion for Hindu men to wear mundu with golden kara 

The &quot;melmundu&quot; is an upper garment similar to the or . that is worn by women; &#x27;mundu&#x27; and &#x27;melmundu&#x27; are part of the traditional Malayali costume worn by men.

Despite the considerable influence of western dressing forms in South Indian culture, Hindu traditional ceremonies of Kerala (some Hindu castes in other south Indian states) it is mandatory for the men to wear the Mundu. For Hindu weddings, men have to wear Mundu along with either shirt or a &quot;mel mundu&quot;. 
Mundu along with is worn during religious occasions by Kerala Brahmins.
It is also considered appropriate for men to wear Mundu during their visits to the temples and attending religious functions, though it is not mandatory at all places. However, it is a mandatory requirement to wear mundu and &quot;mel mundu&quot; for men to visit some famous temples in Kerala like the Guruvayur Temple, the Padmanabhaswamy Temple) etc. For the convenience of devotees, temple managements may provide these on rent in the temple premises.

==Women==
A variant called a mundum neriyatum is used more often by women. The &quot;mundum neriyatum&quot; is a set of two mundus, both having matching &quot;kara&quot;. The set contains a lower garment similar to those worn by men. The upper mundu, worn with a blouse, is wrapped once around the waist and upper body and left hanging from the left shoulder, resembling a sari. This is often called a set-mundu. This is usually worn during festivals or special occasions.

A &quot;veshti&quot; is a small piece of cloth (generally put on the shoulders) along with a mundu, which is worn in Kerala amongst Malayalis for formal occasions.

==Kerala Lungi==
In Kerala, the lungi, also called or , is worn by both men and women. Labourers prefer to wear lungis while working. Most men in Kerala use lungi as casual wear or as a house dress, as it is quite comfortable to wear. Lungis are generally colourful, and with varying designs. They are not worn during occasions such as weddings or other religious ceremonies. Saffron-coloured lungis () are also commonly worn by men.

<text>Oldman (died 1687), King of the Mosquito Nation from c. 1625 until his death in 1687, was the son of a Miskito leader. This earlier king went to England, according to a memorial left in Jamaica by one of his descendants, during the reign of Charles I (1625–1649) but during the time when the Providence Island Company was operating in the region (c. 1631–1641). He was followed by another visitor, alleged to be a &quot;prince&quot; of the same group.

According to the testimony of his son Jeremy I, as recorded in 1699 by an English witness called W. M., Oldman was taken to England and received in audience by &quot;his brother king&quot;, Charles II &quot;soon after the conquest of Jamaica&quot; (1655). He was given a lace hat as a sort of crown and a written commission &quot;to kindly use and relieve such straggling Englishmen as should chance to come that way&quot;.

He was succeeded in 1687 by his son, Jeremy I.

<text>David H. Douglass (born 1932) is an American physicist at the University of Rochester.

== Background ==

==Climate change ==

A 2005 study by Douglass and fellow University of Rochester physicist Robert S. Knox argued that global climate models underestimated the climate response to the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The study also contended that global temperature returned to normal much faster after the eruption than the models had predicted.

A 2007 paper by Douglass and coworkers questioned the reliability of 22 of the most commonly used global climate models analyzed by Benjamin D. Santer and used by the IPCC to predict accelerated warming in the troposphere. The study had originally been submitted to &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; the previous year, but was rejected in September 2006 on Santer&#x27;s recommendation. Santer and 17 co-authors later rebutted Douglass&#x27; paper.

Douglass was named a fellow of Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1963 and elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1969. He is a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.

<text>Kerstin Anita Marianne Ekberg (29 September 193111 January 2015) was a Swedish actress active in American and European films, known for her beauty and curvaceous figure. She became prominent in her iconic role as Sylvia in the Federico Fellini film &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960). Ekberg worked primarily in Italy, where she became a permanent resident in 1964.

==Early life==
Anita Ekberg was born on 29 September 1931, in Malmö, Skåne (Sweden), the sixth of eight children. In her teens, Anita worked as a fashion model. Ekberg entered the Miss Malmö competition in 1950 at her mother&#x27;s urging. This led to the Miss Sweden contest which she won. Despite speaking very little English, she went to the United States to compete for the 1951 Miss Universe title (an unofficial beauty pageant at that time, it became official in 1952).

==Career==

===Universal Studios===
Although Ekberg did not win the Miss Universe pageant, as one of six finalists, she did earn a starlet&#x27;s contract with Universal Studios.

As a starlet at Universal, she received lessons in drama, elocution, dancing, horseback riding, and fencing. She appeared briefly in &quot;The Mississippi Gambler&quot; (1953) with Tyrone Power, &quot;Abbott and Costello Go to Mars&quot; (1953) (playing a woman on Venus), &quot;Take Me to Town&quot; (1953) with Ann Sheridan, and &quot;The Golden Blade&quot; (1953) with Rock Hudson and Piper Laurie.

Ekberg skipped many of her drama lessons, restricting herself to riding horses in the Hollywood Hills. Ekberg later admitted she was spoiled by the studio system and played, instead of pursuing bigger film roles. Universal dropped her after six months.

===Batjac and Paramount===

The combination of Ekberg&#x27;s voluptuous physique and colourful private life (such as her well-publicized romances with Hollywood&#x27;s leading men like Frank Sinatra, Tyrone Power, Yul Brynner, Rod Taylor, and Errol Flynn) appealed to the gossip magazines, like &quot;Confidential&quot; and she soon became a major 1950s pin-up, appearing in men&#x27;s magazines like &quot;Playboy&quot;. Additionally, Ekberg participated in publicity stunts. She once admitted that an incident in which her dress burst open in the lobby of London&#x27;s Berkeley Hotel was prearranged with a photographer.

Ekberg toured Greenland with Bob Hope, entertaining American servicemen. Hope spoke of her beauty and John Wayne signed her to a contract with his Batjac Productions at $75 a week.

By the mid-1950s, after several modelling jobs, Ekberg finally broke into the film industry. She guest-starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1955) and &quot;Private Secretary&quot;.

She had a small part in the film &quot;Blood Alley&quot; (1955) starring John Wayne and Lauren Bacall, made for Wayne&#x27;s Batjac Productions. It was her first real speaking role in a feature.
She appeared alongside the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis comedy act in &quot;Artists and Models&quot; (1955), directed by Frank Tashlin for Paramount, playing &quot;Anita&quot;.

Ekberg&#x27;s greatest opportunity was when Paramount cast her in &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956) which was shot in Rome, alongside Mel Ferrer and Audrey Hepburn, directed by King Vidor. For a time, she was even publicised as &quot;Paramount&#x27;s Marilyn Monroe&quot;.

Ekberg was third billed in a thriller for Batjac, &quot;Man in the Vault&quot; (1956). It was distributed by RKO Pictures who had given Ekberg an excellent part in &quot;Back from Eternity&quot; (1956), directed by John Farrow.

Ekberg signed a deal with Warwick Pictures, the company of producers Albert Broccoli and Irwin Allen, who made films in England. She did &quot;Zarak&quot; (1956) with Victor Mature.

Ekberg returned to Hollywood to make a second film with Martin and Lewis (and Tashlin), &quot;Hollywood or Bust&quot; (1956). Ekberg made a second film for Warwick with Mature, &quot;Interpol&quot; (1957). In 1956, Hedda Hopper said her fee was $75,000 per picture.

She was announced for &quot;Glare&quot; directed by Budd Boetticher, but it was not made.

When John Wayne split up with his producing partner Robert Fellows, Fellows took over Ekberg&#x27;s contract.

===Gerd Oswald===
Ekberg returned to Hollywood to make &quot;Valerie&quot; (1957) with Sterling Hayden and her then-husband Anthony Steel for director Gerd Oswald. She co-starred with Bob Hope and Fernandel in &quot;Paris Holiday&quot; (1958). This film was also directed by Oswald, as was &quot;Screaming Mimi&quot; (1958). She did a third for Warwick, &quot;The Man Inside&quot; (1958) with Jack Palance. Another film was announced for her, entitled &quot;A Lot of Woman&quot;, but it was not made.

===Italy and &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;===
Ekberg went to Italy to star in &quot;Sheba and the Gladiator&quot; (1959), playing Zenobia.

She stayed in Rome to make &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) for Federico Fellini, performing as Sylvia Rank, the unattainable &quot;dream woman&quot; of the character played by Marcello Mastroianni. The film features a scene of her cavorting in Rome&#x27;s Trevi Fountain alongside Mastroianni, which has been called &quot;one of cinema&#x27;s most iconic scenes&quot;.

The movie was an international sensation and Ekberg settled in Rome. She had the lead in an Italian-French co production, &quot;Last Train to Shanghai&quot; (1960) (aka &quot;The Dam on the Yellow River&quot;), then was in &quot;Le tre eccetera del colonnello&quot; (1960), &quot;The Call Girl Business&quot; (1960), &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Mongols&quot; (1961), which had an American director (Andre de Toth) and co star (Jack Palance).

She later said &quot;things became a little bit boring for me after &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; because every producer or director in Italy, England and America wanted me to recreate the same role – the movie star from America who comes over to Italy.&quot;

Ekberg then appeared in &quot;Boccaccio &#x27;70&quot; (1962), a film that also featured Sophia Loren and Romy Schneider. Soon thereafter, Ekberg was being considered by Broccoli to play the first Bond girl, Honey Ryder in &quot;Dr. No&quot;, but the role went to the then-unknown Ursula Andress. However Broccoli then cast her in &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; (1963) with Bob Hope. &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; was featured in the second Bond film, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, during a sequence where Ali Kerim Bey assassinates the Russian agent Krilencu with a sniper rifle. Krilencu attempts to escape through a window, which is situated in Anita Ekberg&#x27;s mouth, on the wall-sized poster: &quot;She should have kept her mouth shut&quot;, Bond quips.

Ekberg co-starred with Andress, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin in the western-comedy &quot;4 for Texas&quot; (1963). She returned to Europe to make &quot;Love Factory&quot; (1964) and &quot;Who Wants to Sleep?&quot; (1965). She went to England for an Agatha Christie adaptation, &quot;The Alphabet Murders&quot; (1965), directed by Frank Tashlin who had directed her two Martin and Lewis films.

Ekberg was in the Italian &quot;How I Learned to Love Women&quot; (1966) then had a small role in a Jerry Lewis comedy, &quot;Way... Way Out&quot; (1966). She was in &quot;Pardon, Are You For or Against?&quot; (1966), an Alberto Sordi comedy; &quot;The Cobra&quot; (1967), an Italian crime film with Dana Andrews; &quot;The Glass Sphinx&quot; (1967) with Robert Taylor; &quot;Woman Times Seven&quot; (1967), an anthology directed by Vittorio De Sica, in a segment with Michael Caine; and &quot;Crónica de un atraco&quot; (1968).

She had a cameo in &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot; (1969) and the lead in &quot;Fangs of the Living Dead&quot; (1969), &quot;Death Knocks Twice&quot; (1969), and &quot;A Candidate for a Killing&quot; (1969).

===Later career===
Fellini called Ekberg back for a cameo in &quot;The Clowns &quot;(1970). She had bigger parts in &quot;The Divorce&quot; (1970) with Vittorio Gassman; &quot;The Conjugal Debt&quot; (1970); &quot;Quella chiara notte d&#x27;ottobre&quot; (1970); &quot;The French Sex Murders&quot; (1972), a giallo; and &quot;Deadly Trackers&quot; (1972).

She went to Asia to make a Hollywood film, &quot;Northeast of Seoul&quot; (1972). In 1972, she sued an Italian magazine for publishing naked photographs of her.

Ekberg was also in &quot;Gold of the Amazon Women&quot; (1979), &quot;Killer Nun&quot; (1979), &quot;S.H.E: Security Hazards Expert&quot; (1980), &quot;Cicciabomba&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Seduction of Angela&quot; (1986). Fellini used her in &quot;Intervista&quot; (1987), appearing as herself in a reunion scene with Mastroianni.

Later performances included &quot;Count Max&quot; (1991), &quot;Ambrogio&quot; (1992), &quot;Cattive ragazze&quot; (1992), &quot;Witness Run&quot; (1996), and &quot;Bámbola&quot; (1996), in a part turned down by Gina Lollobrigida. She had a good part in &quot;Le nain rouge&quot; (1998).

She guest-starred in the Italian TV series &quot;Il bello delle donne&quot; (2001).

In 2021 actress Monica Bellucci co-produced and starred in a mockumentary dedicated to Ekberg, called “The girl in the fountain” presented as a special event at the 2021 Torino Film festival.

==Personal life==

Both of Ekberg&#x27;s marriages were to actors, but neither of them succeeded. She was married to Anthony Steel from 22 May 1956 until their divorce on 14 May 1959 and to Rik Van Nutter from 9 April 1963 until their divorce in 1975. In a 2006 interview she said she wished she had a child, but stated just the opposite six months later. Ekberg&#x27;s great love was Gianni Agnelli, the Italian industrialist and owner of Fiat. They were lovers for several years, although he was married.

Ekberg was often outspoken in interviews, &quot;e.g.&quot;, naming famous people she reportedly &quot;couldn&#x27;t bear&quot;. She was also frequently quoted as saying that it was Fellini who owed his success to &quot;her&quot;, rather than &quot;vice versa&quot;: &quot;They would like to keep up the story that Fellini made me famous, that Fellini discovered me&quot;, she said in a 1999 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 1960, after paparazzi followed her home to her villa from a nightclub, she was photographed kneeing one of them in the groin, and pulling out a bow and arrow to threaten others. Felice Quinto claimed she shot arrows at him. 

Ekberg did not live in Sweden after the early 1950s and rarely visited the country. However, she welcomed Swedish journalists into her home outside Rome and in 2005, appeared on the popular radio program &quot;Sommar&quot;, talking about her life. She stated in an interview that she would not move back to Sweden but would be buried there.

In 1963, she was sued by her publicist. In 1977, she was robbed in August and in December.

On 19 July 2009, she was admitted to the San Giovanni Hospital in Rome after falling ill in her home in Genzano, according to a medical official in the hospital&#x27;s neurosurgery department. Despite her condition not being serious, Ekberg was put under observation in the facility.

In December 2011, it was reported that the 80-year-old Ekberg was &quot;destitute&quot; following three months in a Rimini hospital with a broken hip, during which time her home was robbed of jewelry and furniture, and her villa was badly damaged by fire. Ekberg applied for help from the Fellini Foundation, which also found itself in difficult financial straits.

==Death==
Ekberg died on 11 January 2015, at the age of 83, at the clinic San Raffaele in Rocca di Papa, Roman Castles, from complications of chronic illnesses. The actress had been in a wheelchair for several years after being knocked down by one of her pet Great Danes, which broke her hip. Ekberg&#x27;s funeral service was held on 14 January 2015, at the Lutheran-Evangelical Christuskirche in Rome, after which her body was cremated and her remains were buried at the cemetery of Skanör Church in Sweden, in accordance with her wishes to be buried in the land of her birth.

<text> is a Finnish word variously translated as stoic determination, of purpose, grit, bravery, resilience, and hardiness. It is held by Finns to express their national character. It is generally considered not to have a single-word literal equivalent in English (tenacity, grit, resilience, and hardiness are much the same things, but do not necessarily imply stoicism or bravery).

In recent years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted research on , attempting to quantify it and identify its effects, beneficial and harmful, in both individuals and populations.

==Meaning==
 is extraordinary determination in the face of extreme adversity, and courage that is presented typically in situations where success is unlikely. It expresses itself in taking action against the odds, and displaying courage and in the face of adversity; in other words, deciding on a course of action, and then adhering to it even if repeated failures ensue. It is in some ways similar to equanimity, though entails an element of stress management.

The English &quot;gutsy&quot; invokes a similar metaphor (one also found in other languages): the Finnish usage derives from , translated as &quot;interior&quot;, and as &quot;entrails&quot; or &quot;guts&quot;. See also the colloquial phrase &quot;intestinal fortitude&quot;. Another closely related English concept evokes the metaphor grit.

==As a psychological capacity==
 is a term which dates back hundreds of years. It is described as being integral to understanding Finnish culture. It is a term for going beyond one&#x27;s mental or physical capacity, and is a central part of the country&#x27;s culture and collective discourse. However, hardly any empirical research has been done to explore the meaning of this construct as a possible psychological strength resource, and it has long seemed to have a somewhat elusive nature. It has been usually studied as a cultural component among Finns and Finnish Americans, but as a psychological construct long remained under-researched and poorly defined.

As early as the 1940s, attempts were made to grasp the essence of . The Finnish newspaper &quot;Uusi Suomi&quot; reached out to its audience for their definition of , and conducted a contest. &quot;Uusi-Suomi&quot; wrote: &quot;All of us somewhat know what is... [it] has for long been a topic for discussion here in Finland and abroad. But how do we describe and define what really is?&quot; The quest to define the essence of has evidently been around for almost a century. More recently, William R. Aho, professor emeritus of sociology at Rhodes College, said &quot;we need a good deal of organized, systematic scientific research to discover the scope and depth of , geographically and situationally, and the depth and strength of both the beliefs and behaviors surrounding and emanating from .&quot;

Research that began in 2013 sought to offer more precise language for discussing the term. While examining within the psychological framework, it sought to render it less elusive as a construct by giving it an easily citable definition rooted within the field of positive psychology. as a &quot;psychological power potential&quot; was introduced for the first time at the 3rd World Congress on Positive Psychology in Los Angeles on 29 June 2013. In the study, is described as a psychological key competence which enables extraordinary action to overcome a mentally or physically challenging situation. also contributes to what has been named &quot;the action mindset&quot;; a consistent, courageous approach toward challenges which at first seem to exceed our capacities. , as measured by the Sisu Scale questionnaire, has been established in contemporary psychological research as a strong correlate with well-being and stress. The Sisu Scale is composed of harmful and beneficial . 

A related online survey conducted between March and May 2013 tracked the cultural representations of among contemporary Finns and Finnish Americans. It revealed that is still deeply valued, and that there is public interest for cultivating this strength capacity as well. The study received over 1,000 responses; its data was the basis for thematic analysis. Among the main findings was the perception of as a reserve of power which enables extraordinary action to overcome mentally or physically challenging situations, rather than being the ability to pursue long-term goals and be persistent.

 is a psychological potential that enables the individual to tap into strength beyond their pre-conceived resources. Wielding in the face of adversity helps individuals push through what first seemed like the boundaries of their mental or physical capacities. provides the final empowering push when we would otherwise hesitate to act. can be conceptualized as taking action against the odds. Even though 53% of the respondents believed some people innately have more , a majority of 83% of the respondents believed that is a flexible quality that can be cultivated through conscious practice, rather than being a fixed quality, and the majority of respondents were interested in developing this capacity. Research on is currently continuing at Aalto University School of Science in Espoo, Finland.

 is not always an entirely positive quality. In Finnish, , literally translated, means &quot;one possessing bad &quot;, a description of a hostile and malignant person. The answers from the survey indicate that there can be too much , and according to the survey answers this leads to bull-headedness, foolhardiness, self-centeredness, and inflexible thinking. The study suggests that should be informed by reason and cultivated and practiced with self-compassion.

Like any trait or psychological capacity, is the complex product of genetic, psychological, biological, and social factors, and its comprehensive understanding will require studies from multiple scientific perspectives. Finland may have the initial monopoly on as a cultural construct, but it is a universal capacity and the potential for it exists within all individuals.

The transformative power of narrative is widely acknowledged. People develop their values and contribute to cultural values by communicating with other people in their culture. Fostering may very well be embedded in such behavior, rather than being a genetic trait one is born with. is a new term in the field of positive psychology, and it may contribute to our understanding of the determinants of resilience, as well as of achievement and the good life. It is suggested that positive psychology research could benefit from focusing on and by examining relevant constructs from other cultures.

==Cultural significance==
 has been described as &quot;the word that explains Finland&quot;, and the Finns&#x27; &quot;favorite word&quot;—&quot;the most wonderful of all their words.&quot;
As defined by Roman Schatz in his book &quot;From Finland with Love&quot; (2005), is an ability to finish a task successfully. During the Winter War of 1939–1940, the Finnish perseverance in the face of the invasion by the Soviet Union popularized this word in English for a generation.
In what may have been the first use of in the English language, on 8 January 1940, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported:
In 2009, was described as so essential to the Finnish national character that &quot;to be a real Finn&quot; you must have it: &quot;willpower, tenacity, persistency.&quot;

===Examples===
Singled out for kudos for this attribute was &quot;Finland&#x27;s wiry old peasant President, Kyösti Kallio—full of ...&quot;
The word was also used to describe the Finnish stubbornness in sticking to its loose alliance with The Third Reich from 1941 to 1944 (in the war against the Soviet Union, which had attacked Finland on 30 November 1939):
During the 1952 Summer Olympics, was further described in the context of the continuing Cold War looming over the Finnish capital city of Helsinki:
Well into the 1960s, was used to describe the Finnish resistance to the invasion of 20 to 30 years prior and its continuing discontents. In 1960, Austin Goodrich&#x27;s book, &quot;Study in : Finland&#x27;s Fight for Independence&quot;, was published by Ballantine. Also in 1960, a notable reviewer of Griffin Taylor&#x27;s novel, &quot;Mortlake&quot;, wrote:
In 2004, Jorma Ollila, CEO of Nokia, described his company&#x27;s &quot;guts&quot; by using the word :
A Finnish heavy metal rock singer injured himself, without noticing, at a concert, to which a reviewer wrote:
The concept is widely known in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is home to a large concentration of Finnish Americans. This has extended to include a popular bumper sticker saying &quot;got ?&quot; or simply &quot;&quot;. In 2010, a 63-year-old Yooper named Joe Paquette Jr. of Munising, Michigan, walked 425 miles to the Detroit Lions training facility to bring the spirit of to the team.

The non-profit documentary &quot;: Family, Love and Perseverance from Finland to America&quot; was made by Finnish-American filmmaker Marko Albrecht. The documentary looks at by means of a profile of his late mother, his Finnish-American family, and his uncle Heikki&#x27;s fight against pancreatic cancer. The film was called a time-capsule of modern Finnish-American life.

In a 2008 episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, F1 racer Mika Häkkinen described to James May:
The platinum trophy of the Finnish-made video game Alan Wake 2, given to players who earn every other trophy in the game, is called Sisu.

==As a proper name==

Due to its cultural significance, is a common element of brand names in Finland.
For example, there are Sisu trucks (and Sisu armored vehicles), the icebreaker &quot;MS &quot;, a brand of strong-tasting pastilles manufactured by Leaf and Suomen Sisu, a Finnish nationalist organisation with connections to other far-right groups.

Sisu is also a male name with increasing popularity. More than 2,000 Finnish men have this name, most of them being born after 2010. The son of The Dudesons&#x27;s Jukka Hilden is called Sisu.

Globally, there were several fitness-related organizations and endurance sports teams such as the Sisu Project based in Haverhill and Worcester, Massachusetts, U.S.A. that carried the name and based their philosophy on the characteristics included in the concept , including courage, integrity, honesty, and determination.

Mount Sisu is the name of a mountain first ascended by mountain climbers Veikka Gustafsson and Patrick Degerman in the Antarctic.

 is also the name of a London-based hedge-fund, operated by several directors including Joy Seppala. The firm bought the football club Coventry City FC in 2007.

In Norway there is a seafood company named Sisu Seafood Norway AS that exports Norwegian seafoods.

On the Western end of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, the SISU Ski Fest is a popular annual event, highlighting a 21- and 42-kilometer cross-country ski race &quot;finishing&quot; in historic downtown Ironwood.

===In popular culture===

In season two of McLaren&#x27;s animated program &quot;Tooned&quot;, Sisu is a planet and the true origin of two-time Formula One Drivers&#x27; Champion Mika Häkkinen (and possibly 2007 Drivers&#x27; Champion Kimi Räikkönen as well, based on a Sisu scene near the end of the episode in question). Häkkinen and Räikkönen are both Finnish and have driven for McLaren; Häkkinen won both of his titles with the team while Räikkönen won his after leaving McLaren for Ferrari.

A starship with a crew of partly Finnish descent in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1957 science fiction novel &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; is named .

A World War II movie titled &quot;Sisu&quot;, directed by Jalmari Helander and starring Jorma Tommila, was released in April 2023.

<text>Naked Video is a BBC Scotland sketch show that was aired on BBC2 from 12 May 1986 to 18 November 1991. The show was created by Colin Gilbert who had previously created &quot;A Kick Up the Eighties&quot; and &quot;Naked Radio&quot; (the latter being a radio sketch show that was aired on BBC Radio Scotland, began its ten-year run on 22 January 1981, covered all aspects of Scottish society and featured a lot of topical satire material rather than parody). The series originally starred Ron Bain, Gregor Fisher, Andy Gray, Elaine C. Smith, Tony Roper, Helen Lederer and Jonathan Watson, but they were later joined by Kate Donnelly and Louise Beattie. The series&#x27; producer was Colin Gilbert and its script editor was Philip Differ.

&quot;Naked Radio&quot; proved a popular part of the local schedule, and in 1985, the cast mounted the series on stage at the year&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Gilbert realised the series had potential for television and &quot;Naked Video&quot; was created. It proved popular at a time when alternative comedy was at its peak. The &quot;Naked Radio&quot; series ended in 1991, when it was cancelled along with &quot;Naked Video&quot;. The show also spawned a radio spin-off: the football-themed &quot;Only an Excuse?&quot;, which later also made the transition to television.

In 2000, the cast reunited for a theatre show and radio broadcast, and in 2005, Gerard Kelly presented a documentary for the &quot;Radio Roots&quot; season on BBC Radio Scotland, looking at how the series &quot;sprouted a generation of TV writing and performing talent&quot;.

==Regular characters==
&quot;Naked Video&quot; featured many characters (most of which were one-offs) but some of the recurring ones were:
*Rab C. Nesbitt (Gregor Fisher, Series 1–4): A stereotypical Glaswegian alcoholic, dressed in a string vest, a pinstripe suit and a grubby headband covering a shrapnel wound. He was arguably the most popular character (his wife Mary Nesbitt, played by Elaine C. Smith, and his neighbour &quot;Jamesy&quot; Cotter, played by Tony Roper, also first appeared in this series) and he later went on to receive his own series in 1988 (which was produced and directed by Colin Gilbert, and written by Ian Pattison) which became a successful sitcom (however, his sons, Gash and Burney Nesbitt, did not appear in Series 4).
*The Baldy Man (Gregor Fisher): A vain halfwit who has only a few strands of hair across his head. The character later went on to receive his own series on ITV in 1995, produced and directed by Colin Gilbert, who also worked with Fisher on &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;.
*Drunk Sloane (Helen Lederer): An attractive, but stupid, woman who props up a wine bar and delivers monologues to the camera.
*Bitter Divorcee Lizzie (Elaine C. Smith): An attractive thirty-something woman who, like Drunk Sloane, delivers monologues to the camera about her divorce from her husband (whom she had given the nickname &quot;Fast Eddy&quot;), only from her bedroom as opposed to a wine bar.
*Highlander Angus (Gregor Fisher, Series 3–5): A Gaelic television presenter for the &quot;Outer Hebrides Broadcasting Corporation&quot; who made up news headlines for clips of real-world footage (in one episode, he also held a phone-in competition to win an OHBC vest). He replaced the two presenters (played by Andy Gray and Helen Lederer) who introduced each episode of Series 1 and 2.
*Bernard and Miriam (Gregor Fisher and Helen Lederer, Series 3–5): A repressed middle-aged couple. In one episode, Bernard made an electric chair for Miriam&#x27;s mother, and when Miriam took offence, she put Bernard into it and electrified him (but it did not kill him).
*Siadwell (John Sparkes): A naive young Welsh poet delivering monologues from his bedroom. At the end of the third series, he was killed off, after willingly drinking himself to death.

==Episodes==
A total of thirty 25-minute episodes were produced over five six-episode series. The third series was also produced in 1988 prior to the pilot episode of &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot; (as evidenced by a VHS tape named &quot;Mary and Jim&#x27;s Wedding, 2nd November 1988&quot; which dropped out of a Polaroid camera and had an &quot;18&quot; sticker placed on it at the end of its third episode), but it was not transmitted until 19 January 1989.

On 17 July 2006, Series 1 was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide and 2Entertain, followed by Series 2 on 9 October of the same year, and Series 3 on 29 January 2007. As of 2021, Series 4 and 5 have not been released, whilst series 1-3 have been discontinued and are hard to locate.

<text>U.S. Route 89 (US 89) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway with two sections, and one former section. The southern section runs for from Flagstaff, Arizona, to the southern entrance of Yellowstone National Park. The northern section runs for from the northern entrance of Yellowstone National Park in Montana, ending at the Canadian border. Unnumbered roads through Yellowstone connect the two sections. Before 1992, US 89 was a Canada–Mexico, border-to-border highway that ended at Nogales, Arizona, on its southern end.

Sometimes called the National Park Highway, US 89 links seven national parks across the Mountain West. In addition, 14 other national park areas, mostly national monuments, are also reachable from this backbone through the Colorado Plateau, Wasatch Mountains and northern Rockies.

National Geographic named US Route 89 the No. 1 Driver&#x27;s Drive in the world.

==Route description==

===Arizona===

US 89 begins at Flagstaff, Arizona. The highway proceeds north passing near Grand Canyon National Park and through the Navajo Nation. Near the Utah state line, the highway splits into US 89 and US 89A. The alternate is the original highway; what is now the main highway was constructed in the 1960s to serve the Glen Canyon Dam and Page. The main branch passes over the Colorado River just south of the dam and Lake Powell and then enters Utah. The US 89A branch turns westward and crosses the Colorado River via the Navajo Bridge at Marble Canyon near Lees Ferry. It then climbs on to the Kaibab Plateau, connecting with Arizona State Route 67 at Jacob Lake which provides access to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Just before entering Utah, a junction with Arizona State Route 389 in Fredonia serves the Pipe Spring National Monument. The two highways rejoin in Kanab, Utah.

Historically, the route extended south to Nogales and served numerous sites of the National Park System in Arizona. Just north of the Mexican border is the Tumacacori National Monument (now Tumacacori National Historical Park), while further north Saguaro National Monument (now Saguaro National Park) in Tucson was reached. Short links took motorists to the Casa Grande National Monument and the Hohokam Pima National Monument south of Phoenix. In the vicinity of Flagstaff there is a quartet of parks: Tuzigoot National Monument, Walnut Canyon National Monument, Sunset Crater National Monument, and Wupatki National Monument. North of Flagstaff, US 89 offers access to both the South Rim and North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.

===Utah===
The first city in Utah along either US 89 or US 89A is Kanab where the two routes re-unite. From Kanab US 89 proceeds north passing by Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks National Monument, and Bryce Canyon National Park. It eventually enters Sevier County and the Sanpete Valleys. The highway then passes by Thistle, a ghost town that was destroyed by a lake resulting from a landslide in 1983. The highway then enters the Wasatch Front where US 89 becomes State Street, the main street for many cities in Utah and Salt Lake Counties. The highway is also often in the shadows of Interstate 15 (I-15) during its route along the Wasatch Front. US 89 runs concurrently with I-15 from Bountiful to Farmington, where it departs and runs at the base of the Wasatch Mountains until it reaches Ogden. In Ogden, the highway is Washington Boulevard. From Ogden the highway runs north until it meets US 91 at Brigham City, where it turns east to serve Cache Valley and Logan, concurrent with US 91. In Logan, US 89 forms the southern portion of Main Street before splitting off to the east, passing by the campus of the Utah State University. The highway next proceeds up Logan Canyon to Bear Lake where the highway exits Utah.

Two sections of US 89 in Utah have been designated Scenic Byways. The &quot;Kanab to Mt. Carmel and Long Valley Scenic Byway&quot; is a designated Utah Scenic Byway. The segment from Logan to Bear Lake is designated as the Logan Canyon Scenic Byway by the National Scenic Byways project.

The section of US 89 in Utah, other than concurrencies with I-70, I-15, US 6, and US 91, is defined in the Utah Code Annotated § 72-4-114(8).

Utah is dominated by the Colorado Plateau. Along US 89 are Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and Cedar Breaks National Monument. Although not readily adjacent to US 89, Capitol Reef National Park is accessible from US 89. US 89 leaves northern Utah well north of Salt Lake City and Timpanogos Cave National Monument and the Golden Spike National Historic Site.

===Idaho===
In Idaho, the highway partially circumnavigates Bear Lake, which straddles the Utah–Idaho state line.

===Wyoming===

In Wyoming, US 89 passes through many scenic sites including Grand Teton National Park, the Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River Canyon, and Star Valley.

Passing northward along the western border of Wyoming with Idaho, US 89 enters the Grand Teton National Park. Here, US 89 is the backbone visitor highway for two U.S. National Parks. Leaving the Tetons, the road enters a lesser known park, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, before ending at the South Entrance of Yellowstone National Park. While US 89 and other U.S. Routes are officially discontinuous through the park, some commercially produced maps show these highways running inside Yellowstone National Park itself along its unnumbered roads and across the Wyoming–Montana state line.

===Montana===
US 89 enters Montana at the North Entrance of Yellowstone National Park. It traverses the width of the state before approaching Glacier National Park. At St. Mary, Montana, US 89 is the access highway to Glacier Route One, also known as the Going-to-the-Sun Road.

The Kings Hill Scenic Byway passes through the Little Belt Mountains in the Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana. The route is home to a wide variety of wildlife and provides many recreational opportunities for travelers on the route. The byway is a route that begins on US 89 at its junction with US 12. From the junction of the byway it travels north through the Lewis and Clark National Forest through the communities of Neihart and Monarch and on to its junction with US 87. The route offers access to the Showdown Ski Area and Sluice Boxes State Park. The route travels over the Kings Hill Pass which snow removal crews work to keep open throughout the winter season.

The northern terminus of US 89 is at the Canadian border. There, the highway continues into Canada as Alberta Highway 2.

==History==

When US 89 was first created, it ran as far north as Spanish Fork, Utah. This was the case until 1934, when it was extended to more or less of its current alignment up to the Piegan Port of Entry north of Babb, Montana.

North of Great Falls, Montana, US 89&#x27;s current route was originally numbered as US 87 until 1934. After US 89 took over that route, US 87 ended in Great Falls until 1945, when it was extended to its current northern terminus near Havre, Montana.

Prior to 1992, the southern terminus of US 89 was at Nogales, Arizona, and the highway proceeded to Flagstaff, Arizona, along what is now I-19, State Route 79, US 60, US 93, and State Route 89 between Prescott and Flagstaff via Williams. In addition, there was another US 89A in Arizona between Prescott and Flagstaff via Sedona on which is now State Route 89A.

In central Arizona, the need for a north–south U.S. Highway was largely superseded by the completion of I-17, which now carries the bulk of the traffic and all of the heavy trucks along this north–south corridor. I-17 connects I-40 in Flagstaff with I-10 in Phoenix, Arizona, along a very hilly route that also passes through the Verde Valley.

US 89 in central Utah was discontinuous for most of 1983 due to a landslide that destroyed the town of Thistle and closed the highway for about eight months.

From early 2013 to mid 2015, US 89 was closed approximately south of Page, due to a geological event that caused the roadway to buckle and subside. Traffic was being re-routed via of secondary and tertiary roads on the Navajo Nation. US 89T opened on August 29, 2013, a paved portion of a Navajo route to serve as a long-term bypass of the closed section.

<text>Sir Stephen Arthur Frears (born 20 June 1941) is a British director and producer of film and television, often depicting real life stories as well as projects that explore social class through sharply-drawn characters. He has received numerous accolades including three BAFTA Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards. In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named Frears among the 100 most influential people in British culture. In 2009, he received the Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He received a knighthood in 2023 for his contributions to the film and television industries.

Born in Leicester and educated at Gresham&#x27;s School and Trinity College, Cambridge, Frears started his career working as an assistant director in theatre and film while directing many television plays. Frears directed his debut feature film &quot;Gumshoe&quot; in 1971 and received critical acclaim for his films in the 1980s such as &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; (1985), &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (1987), and &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988). He also received two Academy Award nominations for directing &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Queen&quot; (2006).

Frears is also known for his work on various television programmes, including the television films &quot;Fail Safe&quot; (2000), &quot;The Deal&quot; (2003), and &quot;Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Greatest Fight&quot; (2013). He directed the Jeremy Thorpe BBC One biographical miniseries &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot; (2018), for which he earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

==Early life and education ==
Frears was born on 20 June 1941 in Leicester, England. His mother, Ruth M. (&quot;née&quot; Danziger), was a social worker, and his father, Russell E. Frears, was a general practitioner and accountant. Frears was brought up Anglican. He did not learn that his mother was Jewish until he was in his late 20s.

From 1954 to 1959, Frears was educated at Gresham&#x27;s School, an independent boarding school for boys (now co-educational) in the market town of Holt in Norfolk. This was followed by Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned a BA Law.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
At the University of Cambridge, Frears was assistant stage manager for the 1963 footlights Revue, which starred Tim Brooke-Taylor, John Cleese, Bill Oddie and David Hatch. After graduating from the university, Frears worked as an assistant director on the films &quot;Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (1966), directed by Karel Reisz, and &quot;if...&quot; (1968), directed by Lindsay Anderson. Frears also worked with Albert Finney on &quot;Charlie Bubbles&quot; (1968).

With Finney&#x27;s company Memorial Productions, Frears made &quot;The Burning&quot;, a 31-minute adaptation of a short story by Roland Starke. Although set in South Africa, it was filmed in Tangier. It was released theatrically attached to François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot;.

Frears spent most of his early directing career in television, mainly for the BBC but also for the commercial sector. He contributed to several anthology series, such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot;. He also produced a series of Alan Bennett&#x27;s plays for LWT, including &quot;The Old Crowd&quot; (1979, director: Lindsay Anderson). His directorial film debut was the noir detective spoof &quot;Gumshoe&quot; (1971).

=== 1980s ===

In the late 1980s, Frears came to international attention as a director of feature films. In 1985, Frears found widespread acclaim with &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;. Based on Hanif Kureishi&#x27;s screenplay, the film focuses on an interracial gay romance. It received an Academy Award nomination and two nominations for BAFTA Awards. The success of the film helped launch the careers of both Frears and actor Daniel Day-Lewis.

Frears worked with Adrian Edmondson on &quot;Mr Jolly Lives Next Door&quot;, a 45-minute programme starring Peter Cook in &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot; television comedy series that aired on Channel Four in 1988. In 1985, Frears had also directed a Comic Strip parody of Daphne Du Maurier&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;.

Frears next directed the Joe Orton biopic &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (1987), a collaboration with playwright Alan Bennett. His second film adapted from a Kureishi screenplay was &quot;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid&quot; (1987).

In 1988, Frears directed &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; to widespread critical acclaim. The film was shot in France, with a cast that included Americans Glenn Close, John Malkovich, and Michelle Pfeiffer, and Uma Thurman. Based on the late 18th-century French novel of romantic game-playing and adapted by Christopher Hampton, the film received seven Academy Award nominations. These included for Best Picture and Best Actress for Glenn Close and Best Supporting Actress for Michelle Pfeiffer. The film also received ten British Academy Film Award nominations, including for Frears for Best Direction.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Frears directed the neo-noir crime thriller &quot;The Grifters&quot;, starring John Cusack, Anjelica Huston, and Annette Bening. Martin Scorsese served as a producer on the film. The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Film, and was declared one of the Top 10 films of 1990 by The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. Frears was also nominated for the US Academy Award for Best Director.

In 1992, Frears directed the comedy drama &quot;Hero&quot;, released in the United Kingdom as &quot;Accidental Hero&quot;. The film starred Dustin Hoffman, Geena Davis, Andy Garcia, and Joan Cusack. Many critics compared the film to those of Preston Sturges and Frank Capra, as did Roger Ebert, who wrote, &quot;It [the film] has all the ingredients for a terrific entertainment, but it lingers over the kinds of details that belong in a different kind of movie. It comes out of the tradition of those rat-a-tat Preston Sturges comedies of the 1940s.&quot; While the film was met with generally positive critical reviews, it was not a box office success. Columbia Pictures lost $25.6 million.

Frears has also directed two films adapted from novels by Roddy Doyle, &quot;The Snapper&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Van&quot; (1996). Frears&#x27;s other films include the horror film &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; and the Western &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot; (1998).

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Frears directed &quot;High Fidelity&quot; starring John Cusack, Jack Black, Lisa Bonet, and Joan Cusack. The film is based on the 1995 British novel of the same name by Nick Hornby. It is set in Chicago rather than London, and the name of the lead character was changed. After seeing the film, Hornby expressed his happiness with Cusack&#x27;s performance, saying that &quot;at times, it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book&quot;.

The film received positive reviews from critics and has a score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The critical consensus states: &quot;The deft hand of director Stephen Frears and strong performances by the ensemble cast combine to tell an entertaining story with a rock-solid soundtrack.&quot;

In 2002, Frears directed social thriller, &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot;, a film about two immigrants living in London. The film starred Audrey Tautou, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. It won a British Independent Film Award for Best Independent British Film in 2003. For his performance as Okwe, Chiwetel Ejiofor won the 2003 British Independent Film Award for Best Actor.

In 2003, Frears was attached to direct the James Bond spin-off &quot;Jinx&quot;, featuring Halle Berry as her character from &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002) co-starring with Michael Madsen and Javier Bardem. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were scheduled to return to write the screenplay, and Wade described it as &quot;a very atmospheric, Euro thriller, a Bourne-type movie&quot;. Producer Barbara Broccoli described it as the beginning of a &quot;Winter Olympics&quot;-style alternative to the conventional Bond films. However, the project was cancelled due to &quot;creative differences&quot; between Eon Productions and MGM, and in order to focus on the reboot of the series with &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006).

In 2003, Frears returned to directing for television with &quot;The Deal&quot; (2003), which depicts an alleged deal between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over which of them should become leader of the Labour Party in 1994. Michael Sheen portrayed Tony Blair to great acclaim. In 2005, Frears directed the British theatre comedy &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot; starring Judi Dench, Bob Hoskins. The film was praised for its performances by Dench and Hoskins, with Dench receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

Frears’s next film project was &quot;The Queen&quot; (2006), a film that depicts the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997, and the reaction of members of the monarchy and the public. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where Mirren won Best Actress and Peter Morgan won Best Screenplay. Frears was nominated for the Golden Lion. When released within the United States, the film achieved box-office success and awards. At the Academy Awards, Frears received his second Academy Award nomination for best direction. Helen Mirren won numerous awards for playing the title role, including the Academy Award for Best Actress.

=== 2010s ===

Frears holds the &quot;David Lean Chair in Fiction Direction&quot; at the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, where he teaches.

In 2013, Frears directed the drama, &quot;Philomena&quot; (2013), which was based on the book &quot;The Lost Child of Philomena Lee&quot; (2009) by journalist Martin Sixsmith. This explored the story of Philomena Lee&#x27;s 50-year search for her son, who was taken from her when she was a young unwed mother at a Catholic convent, and adopted by an American family. It also recounted Sixsmith&#x27;s efforts to help her find the son. The film starred Judi Dench and Steve Coogan.

The film premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival to great acclaim and writers Jeff Pope and Steve Coogan won the best screenplay award for the film. The film won the People&#x27;s Choice Award Runner-Up prize at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was nominated for four Oscars at the 86th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress (for Dench), and Best Original Score. It was also nominated for four British Academy Film Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. The same year, HBO released Frears&#x27;s television drama &quot;Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Greatest Fight,&quot; starring Christopher Plummer and Frank Langella. It explores the United States Supreme Court deliberation over banning Muhammad Ali from boxing for refusing to serve in the US Army during the Vietnam War.

Frears directed a biopic of cycling champion Lance Armstrong, &quot;The Program&quot;, starring Ben Foster, which premiered in the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Many of Frears&#x27;s films are based on stories of living persons, but he has never sought to meet any of his subjects. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1316/07) with Stephen Frears in 2008 for its The Legacy of the English Stage Company collection held by the British Library.

In 2016, Frears directed the film, &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot;, starring Meryl Streep. The title character is a New York heiress known as an aspiring opera singer despite her poor singing abilities. Hugh Grant plays her manager and long-time companion, St. Clair Bayfield. Other cast members include Simon Helberg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Nina Arianda. The film was a critical and commercial success, with many praising Streep and Grant for their performances.

At the 89th Academy Awards, it was nominated for Best Costume Design and earned Streep her 20th nomination for Best Actress. It received four Golden Globe nominations, including Best Picture in a Comedy or Musical. In 2017, Frears reunited with Judi Dench, this time in &quot;Victoria &amp; Abdul&quot;, about the real-life relationship between Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her Indian Muslim servant Abdul Karim. The film also stars Ali Fazal, Michael Gambon, Eddie Izzard, Tim Pigott-Smith (in his final film role), and Adeel Akhtar. The film had its world premiere at the 74th Venice Film Festival, and was theatrically released on 15 September 2017 in the United Kingdom. It has grossed more than $65 million worldwide.

In 2018, Frears returned to the limited series with &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot;, which premiered on BBC One and later on Amazon Prime. The project is a three-part 2018 British television comedy-drama miniseries based on John Preston&#x27;s 2016 book of the same name. It is a dramatisation of the 1976–1979 Jeremy Thorpe scandal and more than 15 years of events leading up to it. The series stars Hugh Grant as the politician Jeremy Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw as his lover Norman Scott. The limited series gained great acclaim in both the United Kingdom and the United States. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 97% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 9.05/10. Rotten Tomatoes&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw impress in &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot;, an equally absorbing and appalling look at British politics and society&quot;. Grant received Primetime Emmy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award, British Academy Television Award, and Critics Choice Award nominations for his performance while Whishaw earned an Emmy, and BAFTA win.

In 2022, it was reported that Frears would be directing a film about Billy Wilder titled &quot;Wilder &amp; Me&quot;. An adaptation by Christopher Hampton of the novel &quot;Mr Wilder and Me&quot; (2020) by Jonathan Coe, the film is scheduled to begin shooting in early 2025, produced by Jeremy Thomas.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Frears married Mary-Kay Wilmers, with whom he had two sons, Sam and Will. The couple divorced in the early 1970s. Will Frears became a stage and film director.

Early in his career, Frears made a programme featuring the band the Scaffold. He is name-checked (&quot;Mr Frears had sticky-out ears...&quot;) in their hit song &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;.

 Frears lived in London with Anne Rothenstein and their two children.

Frears was knighted in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to film and television.

==Political views==
A convinced republican, in April 2015, Frears was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of Caroline Lucas at the 2015 general election, but not other Green Party candidates.

In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, Frears signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election.

<text>U.S. Route 197 (US 197) is a north–south United States Highway, of which all but 2.76 miles of its 69.93 miles (4.44 of 112.54 km) are within the state of Oregon. The highway starts in rural Wasco County in Central Oregon at an intersection with US 97. US 197 travels north as a continuation of The Dalles-California Highway No. 4 through the cities of Maupin, Tygh Valley, and Dufur to The Dalles. Within The Dalles, the highway becomes concurrent with US 30 and intersects Interstate 84 (I-84) before it crosses over the Columbia River on The Dalles Bridge into Washington. The highway continues through the neighboring city of Dallesport in Klickitat County and terminates at a junction with State Route 14 (SR 14).

US 197 was established in 1952 using the existing The Dalles-California Highway, itself created as a part of the initial named Oregon highways in 1917. US 197 traveled from its current northern terminus at Dallesport to US 97 in Maryhill along Primary State Highway 8 (PSH 8) and US 830, successors to the original State Road 8 designated along the corridor in 1907. The Dallesport–Maryhill section was transferred to SR 14 in 1979, but was not recognized by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) until 2006.

==Route description==

US 197 runs in Oregon and Washington and is maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT).

===Oregon===
US 197 begins at an intersection with US 97 at Shaniko Junction in Wasco County, located between the cities of Madras and Shaniko in Central Oregon. The highway, a continuation of The Dalles-California Highway No. 4, travels northwest over the Criterion Summit and down along Stag Canyon through the community of Criterion towards Maupin. US 197 crosses the Deschutes River and a BNSF rail line on a warren truss bridge, becoming Deschutes Avenue as it passes South Wasco County High School and through the city of Maupin. The highway continues west into the Juniper Flat and intersects Oregon Route 216 (OR 216), designated as Wapinitia Highway No. 44, and forms a concurrency. US 197 and OR 216 travel north and northwest to Tygh Valley, where OR 216 leaves the concurrency and heads east on Sherars Bridge Highway No. 290 towards Grass Valley. The lone highway continues north up Butler Canyon onto Tygh Ridge, passing through the Tygh Grade Summit. US 197 travels east of Dufur and down into the Columbia River Gorge, entering the city of The Dalles. The highway begins a concurrency with US 30, traveling north over an east–west BNSF rail line to a diamond interchange with I-84. US 197 leaves the interchange and the state of Oregon on The Dalles Bridge, crossing over the Columbia River into Washington. An ODOT survey measuring traffic volume for any average day of the year, expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), was conducted in 2011 on US 197 and calculated that the busiest section of the highway in Oregon was on The Dalles Bridge, serving 5,800 vehicles, while the least busiest section of the highway was north of its terminus at US 97, serving 390 vehicles.

===Washington===
US 197 enters Washington on The Dalles Bridge, a steel cantilever truss bridge that crosses the Columbia River downstream of The Dalles Dam, and travels into Dallesport in Klickitat County. The highway continues north for past Columbia Gorge Regional Airport to its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 14. US 197 is defined by the Washington State Legislature as SR 197, part of the Revised Code of Washington as §47.17.382. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume, expressed in terms of AADT. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the Washington section of US 197 served between 3,700 and 6,100 vehicles, mostly on The Dalles Bridge.
==History==
US 197 within Washington was added to the state highway system in 1907 as State Road 8, later designated as PSH 8 in 1937, traveling east along the Columbia River from Vancouver to Maryhill. US 197 within Oregon is designated as a segment of The Dalles-California Highway No. 4, created as part of the initial named state highway system, adopted by the Oregon State Highway Commission on November 27, 1917. The highway traveled south from The Dalles through Central Oregon to the California state line south of Klamath Falls. Under the United States Numbered Highway system, approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926, State Road 8 in Washington was co-signed with US 830 from Vancouver to Maryhill and The Dalles-California Highway in Oregon was co-signed with US 97 from Shaniko Junction to the California state line. The Oregon State Highway Department created a numbered state highway system to complement the U.S. route system on May 18, 1937, and The Dalles-California Highway from Shaniko Junction to The Dalles was numbered as OR 50. OR 50 was renumbered to OR 23 on May 26, 1950, and became the Oregon section of US 197 when it was established in 1952.

US 197 traveled north onto the newly constructed The Dalles Bridge over the Columbia River to US 830 and PSH 8 northeast of Dallesport and traveled east with the two highways to end at US 97 in Maryhill. US 830 and its concurrency with US 197 were removed from the U.S. route system in 1968, leaving US 197 concurrent with the successor to PSH 8, SR 14, after the 1964 state highway renumbering. The concurrency with SR 14 was removed from the Washington state highway system in 1979, but remained as a part of US 197 as defined by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) until September 22, 2006.

<text>[[Asturias]], an autonomous community in Spain, is divided into eight comarcas (&quot;cotarros&quot; in Asturian). These &quot;comarcas&quot; are not an administrative division of the autonomous community, and are only used as a system to homogenize the statistical data collected by the Principality of Asturias.

The &quot;comarcas&quot; in Spain are a grouping of municipalities that are encouraged (but not required) to work together to achieve objectives. The term &quot;Comarca&quot; is a Spanish word roughly equivalent to the English word county.

==List==
The comarcas of Asturias are listed here, each with its Spanish-language name first, followed by its Asturian-language name if that differs:

<text>MoneyGram International, Inc. is an American interstate and international peer-to-peer payments and money transfer company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It has an operations center in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, and regional and local offices around the world. 

On June 1, 2023, Madison Dearborn Partners completed the acquisition of MoneyGram.

==Overview==
MoneyGram businesses are divided into two categories: Global Funds Transfers and Financial Paper Products. The company provides its services to individuals and businesses through a network of agents and financial institutions.

In 2014, it was the second largest provider of money transfers in the world. MoneyGram operates in more than 200 countries and territories with a global network of about 400,000 agent offices.

== History ==
MoneyGram International was formed when two businesses merged: Minneapolis-based Travelers Express and Denver-based Integrated Payment Systems Inc.

MoneyGram was established as a subsidiary of Integrated Payment Systems, later became an independent company, and was acquired by Travelers in 1998. In 2004, Travelers Express became what is today called MoneyGram International.

=== Travelers Express (1940–1997) ===
The Minneapolis-based Travelers Express Co. Inc. was founded in 1940. In 1965, Travelers Express was acquired by The Greyhound Corporation (later known as Viad Corp) and became the nation&#x27;s largest provider of money orders before initiating a company reorganization plan in 1993.

===MoneyGram Systems (1988–1997)===
MoneyGram was formed in 1988 as a subsidiary of Integrated Payment Systems Inc. Integrated Payment Systems was a subsidiary of First Data Corporation, which was itself a subsidiary of American Express. In 1992, First Data was spun off from American Express and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. First Data Corporation later merged with First Financial, the owners of rival Western Union. In order to approve the merger, the Federal Trade Commission forced First Data to sell Integrated Payment Systems.

Thomas Cook Global Foreign Exchange, under the stewardship of John Bavister, launched a re-engineered money transfer service in 1994. Branded as MoneyGram, the venture saw the partnering of the global travel giant with First Data Corp.

In 1996, Integrated Payment Systems, the nation&#x27;s second largest non-bank consumer money transfer business, became its own publicly traded company and was renamed MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. In 1997, James F. Calvano, former president of Western Union, became MoneyGram Payment Systems CEO. By the late 1990s, MoneyGram Payment Systems had served customers at over 22,000 locations in 100 countries.

MoneyGram International Ltd. was established in 1997 by MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. and Thomas Cook, a year after the company had gone public. At the time when MoneyGram International was established, MoneyGram Payment Systems owned 51 percent of the company, while the other 49 percent was owned by the Thomas Cook Group.

===MoneyGram International (1998–present)===
In April 1998, Viad Corp acquired MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. for $287 million. MoneyGram was then folded into Viad&#x27;s Travelers Express in Minneapolis. In November 2000, the MoneyGram brand and business was sold to Travelex as part of its acquisition of Thomas Cook Financial Services for £400m. In 2003, Travelers Express gained full ownership of the MoneyGram network, including MoneyGram International. Later that year, Viad spun off Travelers Express as an independent company. In January 2004, Travelers Express was renamed to MoneyGram International Inc. In June 2004, Viad sold MoneyGram and it became a publicly traded, individual entity.

By 2006, MoneyGram International had expanded internationally to include over 96,000 agents in regions such as the Asian-Pacific, Eastern Europe, and Central America. The company had also introduced additional services such as bill payment and online money transfers.

During the financial crisis of 2007–2008, MoneyGram&#x27;s shares fell 96 percent from 2007 to 2009. It lost more than $1.6 billion from investments in securities backed by risky mortgages in 2008, and the losses led the company to sell a majority stake to Thomas H. Lee Partners and Goldman Sachs in exchange for a cash infusion. During the drop, U.S. Bancorp shifted its money transfer services to Western Union. The company became profitable again in 2009.

Amid MoneyGram&#x27;s turnaround, Pamela Patsley became the executive chairwoman of the company in January 2009 and was later named CEO in September of that year. In November 2010, MoneyGram officially relocated its global headquarters to Dallas, Texas. The company continues to maintain global operations and information technology centers in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

In 2014, after MoneyGram lost a relationship with Wal-Mart, it began restructuring to cut costs. From a peak in 2013 until late 2015, shares fell about 70%. MoneyGram closed a call center in Lakewood, Colorado resulting in over 500 layoffs, and closed its 376-person Brooklyn Center operation in 2015. MoneyGram moved numerous positions to Warsaw, Poland from its Colorado and Minnesota locations to cut costs further. 

In 2015, the company&#x27;s agent network in Africa reached 25,000 locations, including an agreement with the Mauritius Post Office.

Between late October 2016 and January 2017, MoneyGram&#x27;s shares doubled in value. On January 26, 2017, Ant Financial Services Group announced a deal to acquire MoneyGram International for $880 million; the deal subsequently collapsed after it was rejected by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

On June 17, 2019, MoneyGram announced a partnership with Ripple to utilize the digital asset XRP for cross-border remittance. Within 6 months, in February 2021 MoneyGram announced the end of the partnership after the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple for violating investor protection laws; later that year MoneyGram announced a new partnership with Ripple&#x27;s competitor Stellar to facilitate cross-border blockchain transactions settled in the USDC stablecoin.

In July 2020, Digital Financial Services LLC and MoneyGram have collaborated to provide overseas remittance services in the UAE. Through this partnership, eWallet consumers would be able to initiate real-time foreign money transfers to friends and families in more than 200 countries and territories around the world through a network of mobile wallet providers, bank account deposit facilities, and more than 350,000 walk-in locations.

In February 2022, MoneyGram agreed to be acquired for $1 billion in cash by Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity firm. The acquisition was completed in June 2023.

==Legal cases==
In November 2012, MoneyGram International admitted to anti-money laundering (AML) and wire fraud violations as a result of a criminal complaint filed in the Middle District of Pennsylvania charging MoneyGram with willfully failing to maintain an effective AML program and aiding and abetting wire fraud MoneyGram services were used by unrelated parties involved in mass marketing and consumer phishing scams that defrauded thousands of victims in the United States.

As a part of the settlement, it created a $100 million victim compensation fund. MoneyGram also retained a corporate monitor who reported regularly to the United States Department of Justice for a five-year period, subsequently extended for 30 months after the deferred prosecution amendment was amended. Upon successful completion of the DPA terms in June 2021, the charges of aiding and abetting wire fraud were dismissed. 

The company also terminated any agents complicit in the 2009 scams and invested more than $84 million in improvements to the company&#x27;s consumer anti-fraud systems and consumer awareness education. In February 2015, MoneyGram assisted a Houston reporter in shutting down a fraud scam after discovering a scheme that utilized an account with the company.

In February 2016, MoneyGram agreed to pay $13 million to end a probe stemming from customer complaints that scam artists duped them into wiring funds via the money transfer service. The settlement, with attorneys general in 49 states and Washington, D.C., includes $9 million for a nationwide fund that will facilitate the return of money to some MoneyGram customers and $4 million to cover states&#x27; costs and fees, according to numerous announcements by state attorneys general.

In April 2022, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and New York Attorney General filed a complaint against MoneyGram alleging repeated violations of the law, ignoring customer complaints and government warnings. The complaint states that the company has repeatedly &quot;stranded&quot; recipients waiting for their money, provided senders inaccurate information about transfer completion and failed to address customer complaints in accordance with the 2013 rule. (See Consumer Financial Protection Bureau et al v MoneyGram International Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03256.)

In September 2024, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas granted summary judgment in favor of the US Chamber of Commerce and other trade associations, holding that the CFPB operated outside its constitutionL authority when it attempted to regulate “unfair acts” of practices under the Dodd-Frank Act when it updated its examination manual. The CFPB has appealed to the US Supreme Court. As a result, most all high-level litigation brought by the CFPB is on hold awaiting US Supreme Court review and action on the pending appeal.

==Philanthropy and marketing==
MoneyGram launched the MoneyGram Foundation in 2013, which focuses on distributing grants internationally to support education. The MoneyGram Foundation distributed grants in 19 countries in its first year of operations. The Foundation gets the bulk of its funding from MoneyGram International, and builds on MoneyGram&#x27;s previous Global Giving Program.

Through MoneyGram, Global Giving made a donation of $100,000 to World Vision International for education and school supplies, and another donation of $30,000 for the Girls Exploring Math and Science program in Dallas.

MoneyGram participated in relief aid following the 2010 Haiti earthquake by reducing their fees to only $1 for any transactions to Haiti along with a $10,000 grant to Pan American Development Foundation and American Red Cross. In 2012, MoneyGram contributed to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts by pledging to donate $1 per transaction up to $200,000 to the American Red Cross. Moneygram also contributed to relief efforts following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 in the Philippines. 

The company has also participated in the One Laptop per Child initiative and Habitat for Humanity through the MoneyGram Foundation.

On October 20, 2022, MoneyGram announced a multi-year title sponsorship deal with Haas F1 Team (with the team renamed as &quot;MoneyGram Haas F1 Team&quot;) for the 2023 Formula One season onwards.

As of the end of 2023, MoneyGram facilitated more than 955,000 transactions totaling more than $307 million for its partners Red Rose and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), representing vital aid in seven European countries (Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary).

<text>Joseph Ferdinand Martial Asselin (February 3, 1924 – January 25, 2013) was a Canadian politician and the 25th Lieutenant Governor of Quebec (1990–1996).

==Life and career==
Born in La Malbaie, Quebec, the son of Ferdinand Asselin and Eugénie Tremblay, he was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1951. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1967. From 1957 to 1963, he was the mayor of La Malbaie.

Asselin was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1958 election as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament in the Diefenbaker sweep. He represented the riding of Charlevoix.

Asselin was defeated in the 1962 election. Despite no longer having a seat, Diefenbaker appointed Asselin to the position of Minister of Forestry in 1963, in the hope that he and the Tories would both win the upcoming 1963 election. He served for only a month until the defeat of the Conservatives and Asselin&#x27;s failure to regain his seat.

He returned to the House of Commons in the 1965 election, and he was re-elected in the 1968 election.

Prior to the 1972 election, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of Canada. He sat in the Senate until 1990, when he was appointed as lieutenant governor by the Governor General, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Asselin was in office during the 1995 Quebec Referendum for sovereignty. In 1996, he was made an officer of the Order of Canada.

In 1992, he was given the right to use the honorific style of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;, which is granted for life and to very few eminent Canadians. On January 25, 2013, Asselin died at the Hôpital de l&#x27;Enfant-Jésus de Québec in Quebec City. He was 88 years old.

<text>Kilsbergen is a low mountainous ridge that separates Närke from Värmland. It is the southernmost extension of the taiga in Scandinavia and shows a flora and fauna that are unusual for the latitude. There are several skiing and hiking facilities in Kilsbergen. &lt;br&gt;
Kilsbergen is especially known for its elk population. It was awarded the 1998 Elk Protection medal by Hans Hoffberg in 1993 and these magnificent beasts continue to thrive in the area. The highest elevation is at Tomasbodahöjden, above sea level and the highest point of the province of Närke. The administrative region of Örebro County has higher slopes further to the north.

==Climate==
Being located in the slope formation, the Suttarboda weather station has a humid continental climate. The area has frequent orographic lift and temperature inversion during nights compared to the surrounding plains where the nearest town Örebro is located. The diurnal temperature variation is also often low, courtesy of daytime air cooling at the higher elevation in the slope. SMHI have hosted a weather station since August 1995, leading to records being confined to a shorter timespan than other Swedish stations. Still, during that timeframe, Örebro&#x27;s airport station has recorded several degrees both warmer and colder extremes than Kilsbergen.

<text>U.S. Route 195 (US 195) is a north–south United States Highway, of which all but 0.65 miles of its 94.02 miles (1.05 of 151.95 km) are within the state of Washington. The highway starts in rural Idaho north of the city of Lewiston as a state highway in an interchange with US 95. As the road crosses into Washington it becomes a state highway that connects communities in the Palouse region of Eastern Washington. US 195 travels north, serving the cities of Pullman, Colfax and Rosalia in Whitman County before continuing into Spokane County to its terminus in the city of Spokane at an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90).

The first section of US 195 designated as part of Washington&#x27;s state highway system was codified in 1913 from Colfax to Spokane as the Inland Empire Highway and from the Idaho state line to Pullman as the Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway. The two highways were included as part of State Road 3 in 1923 and US 195 during the creation of the US Highway System on November 11, 1926. Originally, the northern terminus of the highway was at US 95 in Sandpoint, but was truncated to Spokane after US 2 was extended west from Bonners Ferry in 1946.

US 195 was cosigned with Primary State Highway 3 (PSH 3) from US 95 to Spokane and PSH 6 from Spokane to Newport from the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 until the 1964 highway renumbering. US 195 was extended south into Idaho after the relocation of US 95, designated as the North and South Highway in 1916, onto its present freeway in 1975. Bypasses of Pullman, Rosalia, and Plaza were completed during the early 1970s, converting portions of US 195 into a divided highway.

==Route description==
US 195 runs in Idaho and Washington and is listed in its entirety as part of the National Highway System, a system of roads crucial to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense and mobility. As a state highway in both states, the roadway is maintained by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) and Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT).

===Idaho===
US 195 travels within Idaho for from an interchange with US 95 to the Washington state line, entirely north of Lewiston atop the Lewiston Hill in unincorporated Nez Perce County. ITD surveys the roads under its control on a regular basis to measure the amount of traffic using the state&#x27;s highways. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. A July 2011 survey reported average daily traffic of 6,761 vehicles being served the US 95 interchange.

Administratively, US 195 does not exist in Idaho. According to ITD&#x27;s milepoint log, the highway is officially a US 95 ramp into Washington state.

===Washington===

US 195 travels north through the Palouse region of Eastern Washington, from the Idaho state line north to Spokane. The highway serves as an important link between Pullman and Spokane as well as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway and a main north–south route in the region alongside State Route 27 (SR 27).&lt;ref name=&quot;wsdot2011/12-map&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; US 195 enters Washington north of Clarkston in unincorporated Whitman County and travels west to an intersection with its spur route, providing a connection to US 95 northbound towards Moscow. The highway continues northwest through farmland and the towns of Uniontown and Colton along Union Flat Creek towards Pullman. US 195 intersects SR 27, also part of the Palouse Scenic Byway, and travels west of Pullman on a highway bypass of the city. The bypass travels through the termini of SR 194 and SR 270 as it leaves the Pullman area heading north towards Colfax along the South Fork Palouse River. US 195 becomes Main Street within Colfax and travels through the town along a WSDOT rail line to the eastern terminus of SR 272 and SR 26. The highway continues north along Pine Creek and the WSDOT rail line past the northern terminus of SR 271, a diamond interchange south of Rosalia, before leaving the Palouse Scenic Byway at the Spokane County border. The roadway heads north through a diamond interchange in Plaza and along Spangle Creek past the community of Spangle. US 195 enters the city of Spokane as a four-lane highway along Hangman Creek and ends at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-90, cosigned with US 2 and US 395.

US 195 is defined by the Washington State Legislature as SR 195. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of AADT, which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of US 195 within Washington was in Hangman Valley before the I-90 interchange in Spokane, serving 19,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was between Pullman and Colfax, serving 3,100 vehicles. The entire route of US 195 is designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance by WSDOT, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington.

==History==
The Inland Empire Highway was originally a collection of gravel county roads that have existed since 1898 in the Spokane area and 1905 in the Pullman area. These roads roughly followed an early territorial highway built in the 1870s between Colfax and Spokane. The highway was added to the state highway system in 1913, traveling within the Palouse region between Colfax and Spokane. The Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway was also established in 1913, traveling northwest from Sampson Trail Y at the Idaho–Washington state line to Pullman. The Idaho portion of US 195 became part of the North and South Highway in 1916 and was not numbered under Idaho&#x27;s state highway system in 1953. The gap in the Second Division between Pullman and Colfax was named by Whitman County as a highway of importance the following year and was not built until 1925 as part of State Road 3. State Road 23, connecting Spokane to Newport, was designated in 1915 before it was renamed to the Pend O&#x27;Reille Highway and renumbered to State Road 6 in 1923. The Inland Empire Highway was numbered as State Road 3 in 1923 and retained the designation as PSH 3 in 1937, while State Road 6 became PSH 6.
The United States Highway System was established on November 11, 1926, during its adoption by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and included US 195, traveling north from US 95 within Washington through Pullman and Spokane before ending at US 95 in Sandpoint, Idaho. The present four-lane divided highway along Hangman Creek in Spokane was constructed in 1939 as part of general improvements to Eastern Washington highways, relocating the route of the creek and a nearby Northern Pacific Railway line. The section of US 195 between Spokane and Sandpoint became co-signed with an extension of US 2 from Bonners Ferry, Idaho to Everett, Washington in 1946, and the highway was truncated to US 10 and US 395 in 1969. During the 1964 highway renumbering, Washington converted its highways to the present state route system, to take effect in 1970. US 195 replaced PSH 3 and its branches along its present route, with its southern terminus at US 95 atop Lewiston Hill in Idaho and its northern terminus at I-90 in Spokane at an interchange that was opened in December 1965, along with a new segment between Thornton and Rosalia.

Between 1973 and 1975, State Department of Highways completed construction of three highway bypasses around Pullman, Rosalia, and Plaza. Funds that were originally intended for the canceled Bay Freeway project in Seattle were instead redirected to the bypasses earlier in the decade. A four-lane bypass of Colfax was approved for construction in 1971, but deferred indefinitely due to a lack of funding. The western bypass of Pullman was completed in 1974 at a cost of $1.04 million.

US 95 was relocated onto its present freeway, bypassing Washington state, in 1977 and US 195 was extended south into Idaho to the new interchange with a spur route traveling towards northbound US 95. The highway between Uniontown and Rosalia was designated as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway on December 19, 2002, as part of the Washington State Scenic and Recreational Highways program. In 2002, WSDOT adopted a long range plan to upgrade US 195 within the Hangman Valley in Spokane to limited-access standards by constructing new interchanges at four intersections. One of the interchanges, at Cheney–Spokane Road, was completed in 2014 at a cost of $9.4 million. Funding for the remaining interchange projects, estimated to cost $106 million in 2002 dollars, was not allocated and WSDOT is instead considering lower-cost improvements to the intersections. Increased traffic congestion on US 195 in Spokane lead to a development moratorium in place until capacity improvements are made to the highway. The first ramp meter in the Spokane area was installed at US 195&#x27;s interchange with I-90 in 2019.

==Major junctions==





==Spur route==
US 195 has a spur route near its southern terminus on the Washington–Idaho state line that travels east from US 195 to serve US 95 northbound atop Lewiston Hill. The unsigned highway, also known as the Genesee Spur, was established in 1979 on the former alignment of US 95 as it passed briefly through Washington before it was moved onto its present alignment. WSDOT included the road in its annual AADT survey in 2012 and calculated that 100 vehicles per day used the spur route. ITD designates the spur route as US-95 Spur in their milepoint log.
