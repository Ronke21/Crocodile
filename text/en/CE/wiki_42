<text>Begging (also known in North America as panhandling) is the practice of imploring others to grant a favor, often a gift of money, with little or no expectation of reciprocation. A person doing such is called a beggar or panhandler. Beggars may operate in public places such as transport routes, urban parks, and markets. Besides money, they may also ask for food, drink, cigarettes or other small items.

Internet begging is the modern practice of asking people to give money to others via the Internet, rather than in person. Internet begging may encompass requests for help meeting basic needs such as medical care and shelter, as well as requests for people to pay for vacations, school trips, and other things that the beggar wants but cannot ostensibly afford.

Beggars differ from religious mendicants in that some mendicants do not ask for money. Their subsistence is reciprocated by providing society with various forms of religious service, moral education, and preservation of culture.

==History==

Beggars have existed in human society since the dawn of recorded history. Street begging has happened in most societies around the world, though its prevalence and exact form vary.

===Greece===
Ancient Greeks distinguished between the &quot;pénēs&quot; (Greek: πένης, &quot;active poor&quot;) and the &quot;ptōchós&quot; (Greek: πτωχός, &quot;passive poor&quot;). The &quot;pénēs&quot; was somebody with a job, only not enough to make a living, while the &quot;ptōchós&quot; depended on others entirely. The working poor were accorded a higher social status. The New Testament contains several references to Jesus&#x27; status as the savior of the &quot;ptochos&quot;, usually translated as &quot;the poor&quot;, considered the most wretched portion of society. In the rich man and Lazarus parable, Lazarus is called &#x27;ptochos&#x27; and presented as living in extreme poverty.

===Great Britain===
&quot;A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds&quot;, was first published in 1566 by Thomas Harman. From early modern England, another example is Robert Greene in his coney-catching pamphlets, the titles of which included &quot;The Defence of Conny-catching,&quot; in which he argued there were worse crimes to be found among &quot;reputable&quot; people. &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay. &quot;The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew&quot; was first published in 1745. There are similar writers for many European countries in the early modern period.

According to Jackson J. Spielvogel, &quot;Poverty was a highly visible problem in the eighteenth century, both in cities and in the countryside... Beggars in Bologna were estimated at 25 percent of the population; in Mainz, figures indicate that 30 percent of the people were beggars or prostitutes... In France and Britain by the end of the century, an estimated 10 percent of the people depended on charity or begging for their food.&quot;

The British Poor Laws, dating from the Renaissance, placed various restrictions on begging. At various times, begging was restricted to the disabled. This system developed into the workhouse, a state-operated institution where those unable to obtain other employment were forced to work in often grim conditions in exchange for a small amount of food. The welfare state of the 20th century greatly reduced the number of beggars by directly providing for the necessities of the poor from state funds.

===India===

Begging is an age-old social phenomenon in India. In the medieval and earlier times begging was considered to be an acceptable occupation which was embraced within the traditional social structure. This system of begging and almsgiving to mendicants and the poor is still widely practiced in India, with over 500,000 beggars in 2015.

In contemporary India, beggars are often stigmatized as undeserving. People often believe that beggars are not destitute and instead call them professional beggars. There is a wide perception of begging scams. This view is refuted by grassroots research organizations such as Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan, which claim that beggars and other homeless people are overwhelmingly destitute and vulnerable. Their studies indicate that 99 percent of men and 97 percent of women resort to beggary due to abject poverty, distress migration from rural villages and the unavailability of employment.

===China===

====Ming dynasty====
After the establishment of the Ming dynasty, many farmers and unemployed laborers in Beijing were forced to beg to survive. Begging was especially difficult during Ming times due to high taxes that limited the disposable income of most individuals. Beijing&#x27;s harsh winters were a difficult challenge for beggars. To avoid freezing to death, some beggars paid porters one copper coin to sleep in their warehouse for the night. Others turned to burying themselves in manure and eating arsenic to avoid the pain of the cold. Thousands of beggars died of poison and exposure to the elements every year.

Begging was some people&#x27;s primary occupation. A Qing dynasty source states that &quot;professional beggars&quot; were not considered to be destitute, and as such were not allowed to receive government relief, such as food rations, clothing, and shelter. Beggars would often perform, or train animals to perform, to earn money from passers-by. Although beggars were of low status in Ming, they were considered to have higher social standing than prostitutes, entertainers, runners, and soldiers.

Some individuals capitalized on beggars and became &quot;Beggar Chiefs&quot;. Beggar chiefs provided security in the form of food for beggars and in return received a portion of beggars&#x27; daily earnings as tribute. Beggar chiefs would often lend their surplus income back to beggars and charge interest, furthering their subjects&#x27; dependence on them to the point of near slavery. Although beggar chiefs could acquire significant wealth, they were still looked upon as low-class citizens. The title of beggar chief was often passed down family lines and could stick with an individual through occupational changes.

==Religious begging==

Many religions have prescribed begging as the only acceptable means of support for certain classes of adherents, including Hinduism, Sufism, Buddhism, Christianity, and typically to provide a way for certain adherents to focus exclusively on spiritual development without the possibility of becoming caught up in worldly affairs.

Religious ideals of &quot;bhiksha&quot; in Hinduism, &quot;charity&quot; in Christianity besides others promote almsgiving. This obligation of making gifts to God by almsgiving explains the occurrence of generous donations outside religious sites like temples and mosques to mendicants begging in the name of God.

Tzedakah plays a central role in Judaism. The Jewish practice of maaser kesafim requires a contribution of 10% of one&#x27;s income as a monetary tithe, mostly to be given to the poor.

In Buddhism, monks and nuns traditionally live by begging for alms, as done by the historical Gautama Buddha himself. This is, among other reasons, so that Laity can gain religious merit by giving food, medicines, and other essential items to the monks. The monks seldom need to plead for food; in villages and towns throughout modern Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and other Buddhist countries, householders can often be found at dawn every morning streaming down the road to the local temple to give food to the monks. In East Asia, monks and nuns were expected to farm or work for returns to feed themselves.

The biblical figure Jesus is said to have lived a simple life. He is said to have encouraged his disciples &quot;to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.&quot;

Ming China was founded by former beggar Zhu Yuanzhang. Orphaned in childhood due to famine, Zhu Yuanzhang, turned to the Huangjue temple for help. When the temple ran out of resources to support its occupants he became a mendicant monk traveling China begging for food.

==Legal restrictions==

Begging has been restricted or prohibited at various times and for various reasons, typically revolving around a desire to preserve public order or to induce people to work rather than to beg. Various European Poor Laws prohibited or regulated begging from the Renaissance to modern times, with varying levels of effectiveness and enforcement. Similar laws were adopted by many developing countries.

&quot;Aggressive panhandling&quot; has been specifically prohibited by law in various jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, typically defined as persistent or intimidating begging.

===Afghanistan===
Begging is banned in Afghanistan, which mostly exists in Kabul, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif.

===Australia===
Each state and territory in Australia has specific laws regarding begging and panhandling. Begging for alms is illegal in Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Queensland.

===Austria===
There is no nationwide ban but it is illegal in several federal states.

===Belarus===
It is legal to beg in Belarus.

===Belgium===
Begging is legal in Belgium, but municipalities can restrict it.

===Brazil===
It is legal to beg in Brazil, and receive medical care provided by law in SUS (Unique Health System)

===Bulgaria===
Systematic begging is illegal in Bulgaria by article 329 of the penal code.

===Canada===
The province of Ontario introduced its Safe Streets Act in 1999 to restrict specific kinds of begging, particularly certain narrowly defined cases of &quot;aggressive&quot; or abusive begging. In 2001 this law was upheld under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The law was further upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in January 2007.

One response to the anti-panhandling laws which were passed was the creation of the Ottawa Panhandlers Union which fights for the political rights of panhandlers. The union is a shop of the Industrial Workers of the World.

British Columbia enacted its own Safe Streets Act in 2004 which resembles the Ontario law. There are also critics in that province who oppose such laws.

===Chile===
Begging in Chile has been decriminalized since 1998. Nevertheless, municipal governments from time to time attempt to reintroduce begging bans as city ordinances.

===China===
Begging in China is illegal if:
* Coercing, decoying or utilizing others to beg;
* Forcing others to beg, repeatedly tangling or using other means of nuisance.

Those cases are violations of the Article 41 of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. For the first case, offenders would receive a detention between 10 days and 15 days, with an additional fine under RMB 1,000; for the second case, it is punishable by a 5-day detention or warning.

According to Article 262(2) or the Criminal Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, organizing disabled or children under 14 to beg is illegal and will be punished by up to 7 years in prison, and fined.

===Denmark===
Historically beggars were controlled by the &quot;Stodderkonge&quot; or &#x27;beggar king&#x27; for a town or district. Today, begging in Denmark is illegal under section 197 of the penal code, which reads:
 Furthermore, begging which causes insecurity in the streets (so-called &quot;utryghedsskabende tiggeri&quot;) has a harsher penalty of up to 14 days prison.

===England and Wales===
Begging is illegal under the Vagrancy Act 1824. However, it does not carry a jail sentence and is not enforced in many cities, although since the act applies in all public places, it is enforced more frequently on public transport. Local authorities may issue public spaces protection orders for particular areas, making begging subject to a fine.

===Finland===
Begging has been legal in Finland since 1987 when the poor law was invalidated. In 2003, the Public Order Act replaced local government rules and decriminalized begging.

===France===

A law against begging ended in 1994; however, begging with aggressive animals or children is still outlawed.
===Greece===
Under article 407 of the Greek Penal Code, begging was punishable by up to 6 months in jail and up to a 3000 euro fine. However, this law was repealed in October 2018, after protests from street musicians in the city of Thessaloniki.

===Hungary===
Hungary has a nationwide ban. This may include stricter related laws in cities such as Budapest, which also prohibits picking things from rubbish bins.

===India===
Begging is criminalized in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi as per the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, BPBA (1959). Under this law, officials of the Social Welfare Department, assisted by the police, conduct raids to pick up beggars who they then try in special courts called &#x27;beggar courts&#x27;. If convicted, they are sent to certified institutions called &#x27;beggar homes&#x27;, also known as &quot;Sewa Kutir&quot;, for a period ranging from one to ten years for detention, training and employment. The government of Delhi, besides criminalizing alms-seeking, has also criminalized almsgiving at traffic signals, to reduce the &#x27;nuisance&#x27; of begging and ensure the smooth flow of traffic.

Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan and the People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) have criticized this Act and advocated for its repeal. Section 2(1) of the BPBA broadly defines &#x27;beggars&#x27; as those individuals who directly solicit alms, as well as those who have no visible means of subsistence and are found wandering around. Therefore, as a result of the enforcement of this law, the homeless are often mistaken for beggars. Beggar homes, which are meant to provide vocational training, have often been found to have abysmal living conditions.

In 2018, the Delhi High Court declared 25 provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act (1959) as unconstitutional, following petitions filed by Harsh Mander and Karnika Sawhney. In 2021, the Supreme Court refused to ban begging and observed that begging was a socioeconomic problem.

===Ireland===
&quot;Passive&quot; begging is legal in Ireland, but begging &quot;in an aggressive, intimidating or threatening manner&quot; is illegal, punishable by a fine. Gardaí (police) can also direct people begging in certain areas to move on, e.g. at an ATM, night safe, vending machine or shop entrance.

It is also illegal to &quot;organise or direct someone else to beg;&quot; under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011, punishable by a €200,000 fine or up to 5 years in prison; this law was adopted in response to organised begging by Romani gangs.

Prior to the 2011, begging was outlawed by the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847, adopted during the Great Famine, until a 2007 High Court ruling said that it was too vague and incompatible with the Constitution of Ireland&#x27;s protection of freedom of speech.

===Italy===
Begging with children or animals is forbidden, but the law is not enforced.

===Japan===
Buddhist monks appear in public when begging for alms.

===South Korea===
Most cases of begging are illegal. Especially, if it annoys someone, or bothers the traffic, or is for a personal purpose.

===Latvia===
Begging was made illegal in the historic city center of Riga in 2012. Begging in Riga outside the historic city center requires that the beggar carries ID.

===Lithuania===
It is illegal to beg in the capital Vilnius. It is also illegal to give money to a beggar. Both can receive a fine of up to 2,000 litas (€770).

===Luxembourg===
Begging in Luxembourg is legal, except when it is indulged in as a group or the beggar is a part of an organised effort. According to Chachipe, a Roma rights advocacy NGO, 1639 begging cases were reported by Luxembourgish law enforcement authorities. Roma beggars were arrested, handcuffed, taken to police stations and held for hours and had their money confiscated.

===Nepal===

Although the Begging (Prohibition) Act was introduced in 1962, this has not been enforced and the begging population in the capital, Kathmandu has since grown to over 5,000, according to police estimates. Besides the common begging tricks such as asking for money or asking for milk which will be returned to the shop for money, there is a unique scam in Nepal which involves asking a foreigner to buy a shoe box at an inflated price. This shoe box is claimed to help provide a sustainable livelihood for the beggar but in fact, will be returned to the seller for money.

===Norway===
Begging is banned in some counties and there were plans for a nationwide ban in 2015; however, this proposal was dropped after the Centre Party withdrew their support.

===Philippines===
Begging is prohibited in the Philippines under the Anti-Mendicancy Law of 1978 although this is not strictly enforced.

===Poland===
In Poland, it is illegal to beg under the Code of petty offences, if they are able to hold a job or &quot;beg in public in a pressing or fraudulently&quot; (Article 58). The beggar is due to a fine of €365. &quot;Who tends to beg a minor or helpless person or dependant relative depending on him or dedicated under his custody, shall be punishable by detention, restriction of liberty or a fine&quot; (Article 104).

===Portugal===
In Portugal, panhandlers normally beg in front of Catholic churches, at traffic lights or on special places in Lisbon or Oporto downtowns. Begging is legal in Portugal. Many social and religious institutions support homeless people and panhandlers and the Portuguese Social Security normally gives them a survival monetary subsidy.

===Qatar===
Under the article 278 of the Qatari penal code, the maximum sentence for begging is one year. This sentence was increased from a maximum of three months before July 2006. The alternative is housing in a specialized correctional facility. The money will be confiscated in any case. This law is enforced, with a police division dedicated solely for that purpose.

===Romania===
Law 61 of 1991 forbids the persistent call for the mercy of the public, by a person who is able to work, although begging still remains widespread in the country.

US State Department Human Rights reports note a pattern of Roma children registered for &quot;vagrancy and begging&quot;.

===United States===
In parts of San Francisco, California, aggressive panhandling is prohibited.

In May 2010, police in the city of Boston started cracking down on panhandling in the streets in downtown, and were conducting an educational outreach to residents advising them not to give to panhandlers. The Boston police distinguished active solicitation, or aggressive panhandling, versus passive panhandling of which an example is opening doors at a store with a cup in hand but saying nothing.

U. S. Courts have repeatedly ruled that begging is protected by the First Amendment&#x27;s free speech provisions. On August 14, 2013, the U. S. Court of Appeals struck down a Grand Rapids, Michigan, anti-begging law on free speech grounds. An Arcata, California, law banning panhandling within twenty feet of stores was struck down on similar grounds in 2012.

In Baltimore, Maryland, several non-profits have been working with the &quot;squeegee kids&quot; to get them off the streets instead of the police having to enforce the law and have the teens arrested.

==Use of funds==
A 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $638 Canadian dollars (CAD) – those interviewed spent a median of $200 on food and $192 on alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. The Fraser Institute criticized this study, citing problems with potential exclusion of lucrative forms of begging and the unreliability of reports from the panhandlers who were polled in the study.

In North America, panhandling money is widely reported to support substance abuse and other addictions. For example, outreach workers in downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, surveyed that city&#x27;s panhandling community and determined that approximately three-quarters use some of the donated money to buy tobacco products, while two-thirds buy solvents or alcohol.

===Vouchers===
Because of concerns that people begging on the street may use the money to support alcohol or drug abuse, some advise those wishing to give to beggars to give gift cards or vouchers for food or services, and not cash. Some shelters also offer business cards with information on the shelter&#x27;s location and services, which can be given in lieu of cash.

<text>Paris Métro Line 14 (French: &quot;Ligne 14 du métro de Paris&quot;) is one of the sixteen lines on the Paris Métro. It connects and Aéroport d&#x27;Orly on a north-west south-east diagonal via the three major stations of Gare Saint-Lazare, the Châtelet–Les-Halles complex, and Gare de Lyon. The line goes through the centre of Paris, and also serves the communes of Saint-Denis, Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, Clichy, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, Gentilly, Villejuif, Chevilly-Larue, L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses, Thiais and Paray-Vieille-Poste.

The first Paris Métro line built from scratch since the 1930s, it has been operated completely automatically since its opening in 1998, and the very positive return of that experiment motivated the retrofitting of Line 1 for full automation. Before the start of its commercial service Line 14 was known as project Météor, an acronym of &quot; MÉTro Est-Ouest Rapide&quot;.

The line has been used as a showcase for the expertise of the RATP (the operator), Alstom, Systra and Siemens Transportation Systems (constructors of the rolling stock and automated equipment respectively) when they bid internationally to build metro systems.

A northward extension to Mairie de Saint-Ouen opened in December 2020. The line extended further north to and south to Aéroport d&#x27;Orly, as part of the Grand Paris Express project, on 24 June 2024.

==Development==
===The Météor Project===

The original Line 14 linked Invalides with Porte de Vanves until 1976, when it was merged into the southern section of the current Line 13.

Paris&#x27;s east–west axis across has long been heavily travelled: Line 1 of the Métro began approaching saturation in the 1940s, necessitating the construction of Line A of the RER in the 1960s and &#x27;70s; which became the busiest urban routes in Europe (by 2010 there were more than a million passengers each working day). To improve service, the SACEM (&quot;Système d&#x27;aide à la conduite, à l&#x27;exploitation et à la maintenance&quot; --&quot;Assisted driving, control and maintenance system&quot;) was installed on the central run of Line A in September 1989. This improved efficiency and reduced the interval between trains to just two minutes, though an improvement ultimately insufficient to absorb the increasing demand. To cater permanently to demand on the busy artery between and Gare de Lyon new rail lines would have to be built.

Two proposals were made by the transport companies: the SNCF suggested a new tunnel between Châtelet and Gare de Lyon for Line D of the RER allowing traffic to circulate from the north and south-east of Île-de-France. More importantly it proposed &quot;Project EOLE&quot; (&quot;Est-Ouest Liaison Express&quot;), the creation of a new standard gauge line, initially from Paris&#x27;s eastern suburbs to Saint-Lazare, then an extension onwards to the western suburbs.

In 1987, the RATP proposed &quot;project Météor&quot;, (&quot;MÉTro-Est-Ouest-Rapide&quot;) the creation of a new Métro line, from Porte Maillot on the edge of the 16th arrondissement to the Maison Blanche district in the 13th, an area poorly served by transport despite its large population. The project would fit well with the regeneration of the Tolbiac district on the left bank around the new Bibliothèque Nationale de France, in that arrondissement.

The plans to go to Porte Maillot were eventually abandoned in favour of a terminus at Saint-Lazare, with the later possibility of extending the line to Clichy and assimilating the Asnières branch of Line 13, thus simplifying its complicated operation.

Given the pressing need, the council of Ministers of Michel Rocard&#x27;s government approved the project in October 1989. However, budgetary constraints forced the reduction of both. In the first stage, EOLE would be but a simple extension of trains from the suburbs to the new underground station at Saint-Lazare and Météor limited to the central Madeleine – Bibliothèque run, thus leaving the main railway station of Saint-Lazare and the heart of the 13th arrondissement unserved.

=== Construction ===
From November 1989 until the end of 1992, exploratory shafts and galleries were dug; tunnelling proper lasted from July 1993 until early 1995. In September 1993, &quot;Sandrine&quot; was baptised near la Bastille; a tunnel boring machine long and wide, it was capable of drilling a tunnel across. Working twenty-four hours a day, five days a week, she bored below the water table. The terrain, made mostly of loosely packed limestone and marl was favourable to drilling and the tunnel advanced at a respectable a month. The tunnel passes underneath seven Métro lines, the sewers, Clichy-Capucines, and four underground carparks and passes over two RER lines.

Works at the site and the excavation of excavated material from the bassin de l&#x27;Arsenal were delayed two weeks by a flood of the Seine, the waterway route having been chosen to minimise heavy traffic in the city. The tunnel reached the future Pyramides station on 17 January 1995, and Madeleine on 15 March; it stopped underneath boulevard Haussmann in August and was brought to the surface through shafts there the same month.

At the other end of the line, from Gare de Lyon to Tolbiac the tunnel was excavated directly from the surface. It crossed the Seine upstream from pont de Tolbiac, supported by submerged beams the traditional under fluvial support. The last was implanted on 28 September 1994.

As a cost-saving measure, the section from Gare de Lyon to the Bassin de l&#x27;Arsenal was excavated at the same time as the tunnels of Line D of the RER Châtelet–Les Halles. The of debris excavated is about twice the volume of the Tour Montparnasse, Paris&#x27;s largest building; and the of steel needed for re-inforced concrete and structural support is twice the mass of the Eiffel Tower.

=== Incidents ===
Travellers have been largely satisfied with Line 14&#x27;s speed and service. However, despite its automation it has not been free of accidents. While the platform doors prevent access to the rails, they are susceptible to electric outages which have halted service entirely. On 20 September 2004, two trains stopped entirely in the tunnel after a signalling failure. On 22 December 2006, passengers were trapped for one and a half hours after an electrical failure on the line which arose from a mechanical failure. Technological failures have occurred twice: on 21 March 2007 traffic was interrupted between Gare de Lyon and Bibliothèque François Mitterrand; and again on 21 August 2007 a technical failure stopped service.

=== Extensions ===
Traffic on the line grew quickly; after five years in service, there were 240,000 daily passengers in October 2003. That same year, service was interrupted several times to allow the installation of material for an extension north from Madeleine to Saint-Lazare. This section was opened on 16 December 2003, and the line saw a 30% increase in traffic thereafter; this northern terminus of Line 14 is the most important node on the network after Gare du Nord.

In 2007, the line was extended south to Olympiades, an area of high rise towers in the XIIIe arrondissement poorly served by the Métro. The construction of the extension was relatively simple, as the tunnel was built at the same time as the rest of the line. Initially planned to open in 2006, work was delayed by the collapse of a primary school courtyard during the night of 14–15 October 2006. Since then traffic has grown again: at the end of 2007, an average of 450,000 passengers used the line on a working day. Due to its use as a train maintenance area, a new maintenance area was constructed.

A second northern extension to Mairie de Saint-Ouen opened on 14 December 2020, somewhat helping to desaturate the section of Line 13 between this station and Saint-Lazare. This extension was originally supposed to open in 2017, but construction was postponed several times during the course of 2016 and 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic also hampered opening efforts during the course of 2020. The opening of this extension lengthened line 14 from to just shy of .

As part of the Grand Paris Express expansion plans, Line 14 was again expanded both north and south.
The northern extension from Saint-Lazare has a principal aim of reducing overcrowding on Line 13. The adopted solution crosses the two branches of Line 13 with stations at on the Asnières–Gennevilliers branch and on the Saint-Denis branch. Another station interconnects with the RER C station Saint-Ouen, another one with the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare lines at , and the last one with the RER D at . Construction on the extension began in 2014, and it was opened on 14 December 2020, except for Saint-Denis–Pleyel on 24 June 2024.

Line 14 was also extended south-eastwards from towards Orly Airport, with 6 intermediate stations. Both future ends of the line were connected with the completion of the digging of the final tunnel of the southern extension on 3 March 2021 and the one of the northern extension on 15 April 2021. The southern extension to Orly, along with the northern extension to Saint-Denis–Pleyel, was opened on 24 June 2024. A fare of €10.30, almost five times the standard Metro fare, applies for journeys starting or ending at Orly Airport. One station – Villejuif–Gustave Roussy – was not ready to open with the rest of the southern extension in June 2024 and only opened on 18 January 2025. It will provide a future connection on the orbital line 15.

In February 2012 the STIF announced that, with the two extensions planned, a brand new class of rolling stock, the MP 14 will replace the current line of MP 89CA (and upcoming MP 05) stock along Line 14 around 2020. This new stock will consist of eight-car train formations, longer than used to date on the Métro, with the MP 89CA and MP 05 stock reassigned to other lines (including the possibility of Lines 4, 6, or 11, should they one day become automated).

=== Statistics ===
The number of passengers grew year-by-year on the line.

==Impact==
The experience in automated control and doors has inspired several new projects. In 1998, the RATP began planning to automate several existing lines, despite the heavy cost. Automation work on Line 1 began in 2007, along with the introduction of doors on the platform. The upgrade was finished in 2012. In 2022, Line 4 was upgraded and automated following the successful Line 1 project.

The widespread introduction of platform doors for passenger safety is planned, despite the project&#x27;s cost. In January 2004, ground level signalling to indicate the doorways was tested on Line 13 at &quot;Saint-Lazare&quot; station. Several different door models were tested during 2006 and Kaba was chosen to supply them. After testing, platform doors will be rolled out across the network, first in certain stations on Line 13, then on the totality of Line 1 in preparation for its complete automation.

==Technology==
This new line parallel to Line A took the opportunity to incorporate innovations on the rest of the network: the stations are larger and, at , longer and thus can accommodate eight carriages. The runs between stations are longer, allowing a rolling speed of close to , close to double that of the other Paris metro lines and approaching that of the RER. Lastly, the line is completely automated and runs without any driver, the first large-scale metro line in a capital to do so (although driverless operation had been used on the VAL system in Lille and the MAGGALY technology of Lyon Metro Line D).

Some features of Line 14&#x27;s train control system are run under the OpenVMS operating system. Its control system is noted in the field of software engineering of critical systems because safety properties on some safety-critical parts of the systems were proved using the B-Method, a formal method.

Line 14 has some unusual design features – unlike other stations in Paris, its floor tiling is not bitumenised, and platform screen doors at stations prevent passengers from falling onto the track or from committing suicide.
===Signaling system===
Météor as CBTC (Communication-based train control) system was supplied by Siemens Transportation Systems including monitoring from an operations control centre, equipment for 7 stations and equipment for 19 six-car trains, resulting in a headway of 85 seconds. It was the base for the Trainguard MT CBTC, which then equipped other rapid transit lines throughout the world.

===Rolling stock===
Line 14 uses rubber-tyre rolling stock. Three types of trains were used: MP 89CA (21 trains as of 3 November 2013), MP 05 (11 trains as of 20 March 2016), and MP 14 (22 train as of November 2022). The last MP89 and MP05 ran on the line in 2023 and were moved to the newly automated Line 4. The MP89 and MP05 contained six cars, while the MP14 trains which displaced them have eight cars. All Line 14 stations were designed from the start to accommodate eight cars, and the introduction of the MP 14 greatly increased capacity on the line.

==Architecture==
The conceptual design of the stations sought to evoke space and openness. The size of stations, their corridors and transfer halls brings the line architecturally closer to those of the RER rather than the existing Métro lines. The RATP opted for a specific style of the new line, for instance lightly coloured tiling rather than bitumen. The use of space was designed in a contemporary manner: voluminous spaces mixed plenty of light with modern materials and overall eased the flow of passengers. According to the designers, the stations should be the reflection of a &quot;noble public space, monumental in spirit, urban in its choice of forms and materials&quot;. Four architects designed the first seven stations on the line: Jean-Pierre Vaysse &amp; Bernard Kohn six of them, and Antoine Grumbach &amp; Pierre Schall the station Bibliothèque.

Saint-Lazare benefits from a well of natural light visible on the platforms, even though they are five levels below the surface. The station&#x27;s exit is constructed from a glass bubble designed by Jean-Marie Charpentier and situated just in front of the Gare de Paris-Saint-Lazare, pointing towards the row of bus-stops.

Pyramides and Madeleine are endowed with a particular lighting, bright sunshine outside falls onto the platforms; a system which evidently does not work at night. Madeleine has several video projectors which allow cultural installations, for example, one on Marlène Dietrich, an actress, during the autumn of 2003.

Gare de Lyon offers travellers the view of a tropical garden on the right side of trains towards Olympiades, as one enters the station. This garden is situated underneath RATP House at the foot of which the station was built. It occupies a space originally reserved for the Transport Museum. Moreover, it is the only station equipped with a central platform, the only possible layout in light of the area&#x27;s underground construction density.

Bibliothèque François Mitterrand has its own unique design: monumental, fifteen metre pillars and stairs forming a semi-circle seventy metres in diameter.

Olympiades station was developed by the architects Ar.thème Associés following the line&#x27;s guiding principles, defined by Bernard Kohn from 1991. The station thus is in keeping with others in its choice of materials (polished concrete arches, wood on the ceilings, etc.) as much as in its lighting, height of its ceilings, and platforms larger than the average on other lines.

On the other hand, certain stations on the line are notable due to the disagreeable odour of humidity and sulfur that one can sometimes find as far as the changeover halls. Due to the line&#x27;s relative depth, it runs underneath the water-table, creating a constant risk of seepage, similar to that found on Line E of the RER.

<text>Red Dead Revolver is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. It is the first entry in the &quot;Red Dead&quot; series, and was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May 2004. Set in the 1880s, during the American frontier, the single-player story follows bounty hunter Red Harlow&#x27;s quest for revenge after the murder of his parents. A local multiplayer mode allows up to four players to face off against each other or AI-controlled bots in free-for-all battles.

Angel Studios began work on &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; with Capcom&#x27;s funding in 2000. During the development, Angel Studios was acquired and rebranded by Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. After Yoshiki Okamoto left Capcom in 2003, &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; was canceled until Rockstar Games acquired the rights to the game and revived it later that year. The game received mixed reviews from critics and sold moderately well. A successor, &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;, was released in May 2010, and a third game, &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, was released in October 2018, both of which were critically acclaimed.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; is a third-person shooter and action-adventure game with a linear storyline. Players can fight enemies using handguns, rifles, shotguns, and throwable weapons such as hunting knives, molotov cocktails, and dynamite. New weapons can be purchased at the end of each level. Levels usually end with a boss fight, and each boss has a bounty on their head that is collected once they are killed. Each level uses a rating system that rewards players with unlockable content, such as new weapons or characters for the game&#x27;s multiplayer component, depending on how well they completed specific objectives, such as the time taken to finish the level or weapon accuracy.

Though the game lacks an open-world, players may freely explore the small town of Brimstone between levels, where they can interact with NPCs. Throughout the storyline, players mainly assume the role of bounty hunter Red Harlow, but in some levels they get the chance to control other characters, such as English trick-shootist Jack Swift, rancher Annie Stoakes, Mexican Army General Javier Diego, Red&#x27;s Native American cousin Shadow Wolf, and an African American soldier known only as the &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;. Each playable character has a unique signature weapon, such as Red&#x27;s revolver, Jack&#x27;s twin pistols, and Shadow Wolf&#x27;s bow and arrow.

A game mechanic introduced in &quot;Revolver&quot; and later carried over into other &quot;Red Dead&quot; games is &quot;Dead Eye&quot;, a targeting system that temporarily puts the player in slow motion to place one or multiple precise shots on an enemy&#x27;s body. When the targeting sequence ends, the player character automatically fires to all marked locations in very quick succession, dealing high amounts of damage. Dead Eye is also utilized in the game&#x27;s duels, which consist of four stages:
* Grabbing – the player controls the character&#x27;s hand and must direct it towards the weapon.
*Drawing – the player moves the right analog stick back up to remove the weapon from its holster.
*Acquiring locks – the right analog stick is used to move the crosshairs over the opponent&#x27;s body and place several targets.
*Shooting – once the bullet time effect ends, the player character automatically fires bullets in rapid succession.

The game includes a local multiplayer component, which can be played by one to four players, alongside one to three AI-controlled bots. There are three game modes, mostly free-for-all battles, where the goal is to be the last man standing. The multiplayer component utilizes most maps and character models from the single-player campaign, with only a few exclusive ones.

==Plot==
In the 1870s, prospectors Nate Harlow (Kurt Rhoads) and Griff (Bert Pence) find gold in an area called Bear Mountain and celebrate by crafting two identical revolvers, each taking one. When Griff is later captured by the Mexican Army, he convinces corrupt army general Javier Diego (Robert Jimenez) to spare his life by offering to show him where the gold is hidden. Diego instructs his right-hand man, an American mercenary calling himself Colonel Daren (Dennis Ostermaier), to kill Nate and his family in order to conceal the gold&#x27;s location. Daren and a band of hired guns murder Nate and his Native American wife, Falling Star (Messeret Stroman), but their teenage son, Red (Jason Fuchs), escapes after shooting off Daren&#x27;s left arm with his father&#x27;s revolver, the heat from which burns a scorpion-shaped scar into his hand.

Twelve years later, Red (Robert Bogue) has become a ruthless bounty hunter. After slaughtering a gang of outlaws led by Bloody Tom (Christian Tanno), he takes their bodies to the town of Widows Patch for the bounty on their heads. There, he is ambushed by Ugly Chris (Erick Devine) and his men, who control the town. Red kills the gang with the help of Sheriff O&#x27;Grady (Stephen Schnetzer), though the latter is wounded during the shootout. Red takes O&#x27;Grady to Brimstone, the nearest town with a doctor, foiling a train robbery on the way there. In Brimstone, Red meets local lawman Sheriff Bartlett (Gene Jones), who offers him several bounties on vicious outlaws plaguing the area. While claiming one such bounty, Red meets and befriends English trick-shootist Jack Swift (Gregg Martin). After being saved by Red, Jack personally guns down his treacherous former employer and his henchmen.

After eliminating all his targets, Red returns to Bartlett, who informs that the wagon train carrying his payment hasn&#x27;t arrived yet. At the Brimstone Bank, Red overhears local rancher Annie Stoakes (Carrie Keranen) mentioning the gold his parents were killed over. Intrigued, he visits her at her ranch shortly after it is burned on the orders of Governor Griffon as retribution for Annie refusing to sell her property. Red offers to give her all his bounty money once he receives it in exchange for information on Bear Mountain, which Red learns is partially owned by Griffon. Later, at a saloon, Red overhears some thugs talking about Colonel Daren, and winds up killing them in a gunfight when they refuse to tell him more. Bartlett arrests Red, but quickly releases him upon learning he is Nate Harlow&#x27;s son, and reveals the circumstances surrounding his parents&#x27; murder.

Red leaves to exact revenge on Diego, but is captured by Daren after destroying one of their supply trains. While imprisoned and forced to work as a slave mining gold, Red befriends a fellow captive referred to only as the &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot; (Benton Greene), before the pair are rescued by Red&#x27;s Native American cousin Shadow Wolf (Chaske Spencer). After escaping from the mines, Red and Shadow Wolf storm Diego&#x27;s camp and kill Daren, though Shadow Wolf is mortally wounded during the battle. Diego then tries to escape via armored train, but Red chases him down and kills him. Meanwhile, Buffalo Soldier travels to Brimstone to seek Governor Griffon&#x27;s help, only for the governor to reveal his affiliation with Diego and order Buffalo imprisoned.

Later, Red, Annie, and Jack participate in Brimstone&#x27;s yearly quick-draw competition, hosted by Griffon and Bartlett. Griffon manipulates the competition to ensure Red is killed, but the latter defeats all his opponents. Enraged, Griffon pulls out his revolver to kill Red himself, but the latter notices the weapon is identical to his own revolver, and deduces Griffon is actually his father&#x27;s traitorous partner Griff. As Griffon makes his escape, he orders his henchman, Mr. Kelley (Joseph Melendez), to kill Red. After dealing with Kelley, Red storms Griffon&#x27;s mansion alongside Annie, Jack and Bartlett. After cutting their way through the governor&#x27;s bodyguards, Jack sacrifices himself to buy Red enough time to kill Griffon in a duel, while Annie finds and rescues Buffalo Soldier. His family finally avenged, Red thanks his allies for their help, and is offered the gold that he is owed by Bartlett, who thanks him for all the good he has done for Brimstone. Honouring his promise to Annie, Red tells the sheriff to give the gold to her and Buffalo Soldier, and leaves with Griffon&#x27;s revolver, saying that “it was never about the money.&quot;

==Development==
Angel Studios began working on &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; under the oversight and funding of Japanese video game publisher Capcom in 2000. The project stemmed from Angel Studios and Capcom&#x27;s partnership on the &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; port for the Nintendo 64. Capcom&#x27;s Yoshiki Okamoto then approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original intellectual property entitled &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; It later adopted a Western theme at Okamoto&#x27;s recommendation, redefining the acronym as &quot;Spaghetti Western Action Team&quot;. It is reported that inspiration for that came from Okamoto — who had previously worked on Capcom&#x27;s 1985 arcade shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Gun.Smoke&quot;—upon viewing the movie Blindman. Artist Akira Yasuda, also known as Akiman, moved to United States to work on &quot;Red Dead Revolver&#x27;s&quot; character design.

Capcom announced the game in March 2002. Its development was troubled, partially due to cultural differences between the two companies, and the game remained unplayable.

In November 2002, Take-Two Interactive, parent company of Rockstar Games, announced that they had acquired Angel Studios, with it being moved to the Rockstar Games label and being renamed Rockstar San Diego. Following the purchase, Rockstar Games executives reviewed projects in development at the studio, so to sort out what was worth keeping. Dan Houser, creative director at Rockstar Games, remarked that the game &quot;looked very good&quot; and caught the review team&#x27;s eyes, despite it being in an unplayable state. The troubled development led to that unplayable state of the game, with it missing both the 2002 European Computer Trade Show and the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Okamoto then left Capcom, which eventually cancelled the title in August 2003. However, Rockstar Games acquired the rights to &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; the following December, and let Rockstar San Diego go on to develop what would become the first installment in the acclaimed &quot;Red Dead&quot; series.

The PlayStation 2 version was released on PlayStation 4 on October 11, 2016, and the Xbox version was made available on Xbox One via backward compatibility on November 15, 2021.

==Reception==
&quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Capcom later in 2004, almost a year after the company had cancelled the title, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 31 out of 40.

&quot;The Times&quot; gave it four stars out of five, saying that it &quot;has a strong, coherent storyline that whisks Red from novice gunslinger to competent bounty hunter in what proves to be the mother of all shooting practice games.&quot; &quot;Maxim&quot; similarly gave it four stars out of five, saying that &quot;Show-offs can even stealthily duck behind cover and shoot at foes&#x27; feet to make &#x27;em jig like Michael Flatley sans Ritalin.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a C and said that &quot;The game misses its mark: Instead of the gritty, scrub-brush humor of a Sergio Leone pic, &quot;Revolver&quot; feels like a rootin&#x27;-tootin&#x27; Disneyland ride.&quot;

It was nominated for GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best Licensed Music&quot; award, which went to &quot;&quot;. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

===Sales===
According to market research firm The NPD Group, &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; sold 140,000 units during June 2004 and had lifetime sales of 920,000 by July 2010.

==Sequels==
The first glimpse at a sequel was in 2005 when Rockstar showed a teaser at a Sony press conference. The successor to &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot;, &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;, was officially announced for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009. After a few delays in release dates, it was finally released on May 18, 2010 in North America, and on May 21, 2010 in Europe and Australia to critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the game&#x27;s gameplay and technical improvements over its predecessor.

&quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; was confirmed by Rockstar in October 2016, and was released on October 26, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was released for Windows on November 5, 2019.

<doc id="916629" wikidata="Q3544893" url="?curid=916629" title="Protoculture Addicts">
<text>Protoculture Addicts was a Canadian-based anime and manga themed magazine published by Protoculture Inc., an Anime News Network company. The term &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; was also used by the Zentradi (an alien race that appeared in the &quot;Macross&quot; series) to refer to all the races that have been in contact with Protoculture.

Although it was a North American publication, it also covered many things about the state of anime and manga in France and the French-speaking world. Manga and anime are readily available in Europe, and the magazine was started in Montreal, Quebec, a francophone region of Canada with a mixture of French and English speakers.

==History==
&quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; was the first large mainstream anime and manga magazine in North America. Its name derives from the popularity of the &quot;Robotech&quot; anime series, and its namesake, Protoculture. It started as a &quot;Robotech&quot; fanzine, became officially licensed as such, and then expanded to cover anime in general. Many of the series that it reviewed and presented details of, including spoilers, were months in advance of legal release in the English-speaking West.

The first test release, Issue #0, was published by Claude J. Pelletier in the fall of 1987. Issue #1 officially launched the fanzine in the spring of 1988. It later became a standard commercial magazine.

===Acquisition by Anime News Network===
In 2005, with Issue #82, &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; became &quot;Anime News Network&#x27;s Protoculture Addicts&quot;, a sister publication to popular anime news and information website Anime News Network. In May 2006, the first full color issue (#88) of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; was released with the addition of a manga insert and several changes based on the readers feedback. Issue #89 was published later in end November and returned to its bimonthly schedule.

===End of regular production===
The last regularly released issue of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; was #97, the July/August 2008 edition. This was a symptom of the general collapse of the North American anime market which occurred throughout 2008 following the closure of Geneon USA in September 2007 However, it was also the result of increased competition with anime news websites, such as Anime News Network itself. Only a few months before, &quot;Newtype USA&quot; shut down in February 2008 This was followed not long afterwards by the closure of &quot;Anime Insider&quot; magazine in March 2009, the last anime news magazine published on a monthly basis in North America.

The magazine still technically exists, though only as a neglected subsidiary of Anime News Network, and for all intents and purposes it has been directly absorbed by ANN. According to their forum, Anime News Network officially discontinued efforts to release &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; as a regularly released magazine with issue #97, but hoped to continue the name as a bi-annual trade paperback, not focusing on news (a function which had been supplanted by the internet) but on special features and reviews. However, the project has not been given a high priority, and only two staffers were assigned to gradually produce the special trade-paperback issue, which was still going to be numbered &quot;&quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; #98&quot; to continue the legacy of the original magazine. A new issue of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; had not been published since 2008. This leaves &quot;Otaku USA&quot; as the only regularly published anime news magazine in North America, which is published on a bi-monthly schedule.

<doc id="916630" wikidata="Q1293321" url="?curid=916630" title="Patricia Manterola">
<text>Patricia Manterola (; born Bertha Patricia Manterola Carrión) is a Mexican singer and actress born in Mexico City.

==Background==
Patricia Manterola Carrion was born to Jorge Manterola and Maria Dolores Carrion, the second of three children. Her brother Jorge, is 11 months older, and her younger sister Michelle, who shares the same birth date as Patricia, is eight years younger.

Paty—as she is also known—attended elementary school at &quot;Colegio Miguel Angel&quot; and &quot;Franco-Espanol.&quot; She studied at &quot;Colegio Oxford&quot; in Cuernavaca during her middle school years, where she lived with her extended family for a while. For high school she attended &quot;Tecnológico de Monterey&quot; de Cuernavaca and graduated in Mexico City at &quot;Colegio Miguel Angel.&quot;

In addition to her academics, Paty studied dance, voice, and music. She was the main voice in the chorus of the &quot;Miguel Angel Institute.&quot; Since she was a little girl she demonstrated an affinity for the entertainment world, participating in school plays, until at the age of nine, she was part of the musical comedy &quot;Anita la Huerfanita,&quot; (Little Orphan Annie). Later, she was part of the festival &quot;Juguemos a Cantar&quot; (1982), together with her brother, Jorge, and two friends, she made it to the finals, which allowed her to record on a compilation album edited for the festival.

Manterola soon entered the world of modeling, which allowed her to meet the Mexican producer Luis de Llano, in 1989, creator of the band, &quot;Timbiriche&quot; and a successful producer of telenovelas (soap operas). De Llano eventually suggested she audition for the group, but noticing her talent, invited her to be part of a new project known as Garibaldi.

==Personal life==
On April 17, 1999, Paty married Javier Ortiz, a fellow ex-member of Garibaldi. Yet they divorced a little over five years later, in 2005. In a joint letter to the media, Manterola and Ortiz addressed their separation and asked for the public to respect their privacy during this difficult time.
She married Forrest Kolb on December 12, 2010 in Xcaret on the Mayan Riviera, Mexico. They were married in a small private wedding with 200 guests and she was dressed by her close friend, Nicolas Felizola. 

==Acting==
Manterola made her acting debut with &quot;¿Dónde Quedó La Bolita?&quot; (1993), a comedy featuring Garibaldi. In 1994, after a Garibaldi live performance in Acapulco, Manterola launched her solo career with the release of &quot;Hambre de Amor&quot;. Paty&#x27;s newfound acclaim allowed her to make the smooth transition into acting. Soon thereafter, Paty earned roles in various telenovelas (soap opera) such as &quot;Acapulco, Cuerpo y Alma&quot; (1995) and &quot;Gente Bien&quot; (1997). She received the newcomer of the year award from the Latin American soap opera magazine, &quot;TV y Novelas&quot; for her portrayal of Lorena on &quot;Acapulco, Cuerpo y Alma&quot;.

Within a few years, Manterola was a sought after star, acting in several telenovelas such as: &quot;Los Angeles de Charlie&quot; (Charlie&#x27;s Angels), &quot;Apuesta por un amor&quot; (Gamble for Love), and &quot;Destilando Amor&quot;. She has also done cameo appearances in &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, Muchas Muchachas and in La Fea Mas Bella. Manterola was nominated for a TVyNovelas Award for Best Lead Actress for her work on &quot;Apuesta por un amor&quot;.

While Manterola has received greater acclaim in her native Mexico, she has also had a transnational impact by appearing in American television and films. For instance, she has appeared in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Arli$$&quot;, &quot;Souvenir&quot; (1997), &quot;The Hazard City&quot; (2000), &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood!&quot; (2000) and &quot;Carman: The Champion&quot; (2001).

In her role as Gabriela in the &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; movie, Manterola demonstrated her bilingual ability as her character was pitted as Bo Duke&#x27;s (John Schneider) love interest. A few years prior to the movie&#x27;s release, she had enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to study English.

In addition, Manterola had roles on the movies &quot;The Singer&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Perfect Game&quot; (2009).

==Activism==
Manterola has also been a noted defender of animal rights. On her personal website, Manterola declares: &quot;Hasta los animales mas exoticos merecen vivir en libertad.&quot; (&quot;Even the most exotic animals deserve to live in freedom.&quot;)

As such, in 2001 she posed nude on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In 2004, she protested Kentucky Fried Chicken&#x27;s cruel treatment of chickens and urged the multimillion-dollar corporation to adhere to a kinder, gentler methodology. More recently, Paty has advocated on behalf of the monarch butterflies that migrate from Alaska to the Mexican state of Michoacán. She donated personal jewelry which was sold at auction to further the cause.

Manterola&#x27;s altruism is not solely restricted to animal rights and the environment. In January 2006, she personally donated 1,500 toys for the children of the &quot;Delegacion Miguel Hidalgo&quot; in Chapultepec. &quot;No hay con qué pagar la sonrisa de un niño,&quot; Manterola said. (&quot;A child&#x27;s smile is priceless.&quot;) In 2007, Patricia joined the Baja Una Estrella Foundation to help in the development of education, health, and social development for poor communities in Mexico.

==Designing career==
In 2004, Manterola planned to open a business in the Mexican city of Puebla, launching her own line of jeans, &quot;B-good&quot;, suitable for everybody.

<text>Ngāti Toa, also called Ngāti Toarangatira or Ngāti Toa Rangatira, is a Māori &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) based in the southern North Island and the northern South Island of New Zealand. Ngāti Toa remains a small iwi with a population of about 9,000. The iwi is centred around Porirua, Plimmerton, Kāpiti, Blenheim and Arapaoa Island. It has four marae: Takapūwāhia and Hongoeka in Porirua City, and Whakatū and Wairau in the South Island. Ngāti Toa&#x27;s governing body has the name &quot;Te Rūnanga o Toa Rangatira&quot;.

The iwi traces its descent from the eponymous ancestor Toarangatira. Ngāti Toa lived in the Kāwhia region of the North Island until the 1820s, when forced out by conflict with other Tainui iwi, led by Pōtatau Te Wherowhero ( – 1860), who later became the first Māori King (). Ngāti Toa, Ngāti Rārua and Ngāti Koata, led by Te Rauparaha ( – 1849), escaped south and invaded Taranaki and the Wellington regions together with three north Taranaki iwi, Te Āti Awa, Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Mutunga. Together they fought and conquered the people of Wellington, Ngāti Ira, who practically ceased to exist as an independent iwi.
After the 1820s, the region conquered by Ngāti Toa extended from Miria-te-kakara at Rangitikei to Wellington, and across Cook Strait to Wairau and Nelson.

== History ==
===Origins of the iwi===
The ancestors of the Ngāti Toa people came to New Zealand on the &quot;Tainui&quot; canoe. The tribe lived in the Kāwhia region, a western coastal part of the present-day Waikato Region, for many generations until the early 19th century.

Tū-pāhau, a descendant of Hoturoa, the captain of the &quot;Tainui&quot;, received warning of an imminent attack by Tāmure, a priest of Tainui, and at once organised a plan of defence and attack. Tū-pāhau had only 300 warriors against Tāmure&#x27;s army of 2,000, but Tū-pāhau and his followers won the battle. Tū-pāhau spared Tāmure&#x27;s life, to which Tāmure responded, &quot;Tēnā koe Tū-pāhau, te toa rangatira!&quot;, meaning &quot;Hail Tū-pāhau the chivalrous warrior!&quot; (&quot;toa&quot; meaning &quot;brave man&quot; or &quot;champion&quot; and &quot;rangatira&quot; meaning &quot;gallant&quot;, &quot;grand&quot;, &quot;admirable&quot; or &quot;chiefly&quot;). From then on, Tū-pāhau&#x27;s tribe was known as Ngāti Toarangatira.

Later, Tū-pāhau&#x27;s son and daughter-in-law had a child who received the name &quot;Toarangatira&quot; to commemorate both this event and the subsequent peace made between Tāmure and Tū-pāhau. Due to his capabilities in leadership and warfare, Toarangatira took the senior leadership role, despite having an older brother. Ngāti Toa trace their descent from Toarangatira.

=== Migrations ===

From the late 18th century Ngāti Toa and related tribes constantly warred with the Waikato–Maniapoto tribes for control of the rich fertile land north of Kāwhia. The wars intensified with every killing of a major chief and with each insult and slight suffered, peaking with the huge battle of Hingakaka in the late 18th or early 19th century, in which Ngāti Toa and their allies were routed. The conflicts forced Ngāti Toa to migrate away from their Kāwhia homeland, first to Taranaki, then to the Cook Strait region, under the leadership of their chief Te Rauparaha in the 1820s. Together, the two migrations &quot;Heke Tahutahuahi&quot; and &quot;Heke Tātaramoa&quot; have the name &quot;Heke mai raro&quot;, meaning &quot;migration from the north&quot;. The carved meeting-house bearing the name &quot;Te Heke Mai Raro&quot;, which stands on Hongoeka Marae, immortalises the migration.

&quot;Heke Tahutahuahi&quot; (translatable as the &quot;fire lighting expedition&quot;) brought Ngāti Toa out of Kāwhia and into Taranaki in 1820. The Taranaki &quot;iwi&quot; Ngāti Mutunga presented Ngāti Toa with Pukewhakamaru Pā, as well as with the cultivations nearby. Pukewhakamaru lay inland of Ōkokī, up the Urenui River. Ngāti Toa stayed at Pukewhakamaru for 12 months. The Waikato–Maniapoto alliance followed Ngāti Toa to Taranaki and battles ensued there, most notably the battle of Motunui between Waikato–Maniapoto and the Ngāti Tama, Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Mutunga alliance.

The name &quot;Heke Tātaramoa&quot; (translatable as the &quot;bramble bush migration&quot;) commemorates the difficulties experienced during Ngāti Toa&#x27;s second migration. They left Ōkokī around February–March 1822 after harvesting crops planted for the journey. This &quot;heke&quot; also included some people from Ngāti Tama, Ngāti Mutunga and Te Āti Awa. The &quot;heke&quot; arrived in the Horowhenua–Kāpiti region in the early 1820s and settled first in Te Awamate, near the mouth of the Rangitīkei River, then at Te Wharangi (now Foxton Beach), at the mouth of the Manawatū River, and then eventually on Kapiti Island.

=== Te Rauparaha ===

Parekōwhatu of Ngāti Raukawa, the wife of Werawera of Ngāti Toa, gave birth to Te Rauparaha in about the 1760s. According to tribal tradition the birth took place near Kāwhia. Te Rauparaha became the foremost chief of Ngāti Toa, credited with leading Ngāti Toa forces against the Waikato and Ngāti Maniapoto &quot;iwi&quot; and then, after his defeat, with piloting the migration to, and the conquest and settlement of, the Cook Strait region in the 1820s. Later he crossed Cook Strait to attack the Rangitane people in the Wairau valley. His attempt to conquer the southern South Island iwi was thwarted by an outbreak of measles which killed many of his warriors.

Te Rauparaha signed the Treaty of Waitangi twice in 1840: first at Kapiti Island and then again at Wairau. Te Rauparaha resisted European settlement in areas that he claimed he had not sold. Later disputes occurred over Porirua and the Hutt Valley. But the major clash came in 1843 when Te Rauparaha and his nephew Te Rangihaeata tried to prevent the survey of lands in the Wairau plains. These lands had been claimed by the New Zealand Company &quot;on two grounds – alleged purchase by Captain Blenkinsop, master of a Sydney whaler in 1831-2; and the negotiations between their principal agent (Colonel Wakefield) and Rauparaha, the head of this tribe, in 1839&quot;. Te Rauparaha burnt down a whare that housed survey equipment. The Nelson magistrate ordered his arrest and deputised a number of citizens as police. Te Rauparaha resisted arrest and fighting broke out, resulting in the death of Te Rongo, the wife of Te Rangihaeata. Te Rangihaeata then killed the survey-party, who had surrendered, to avenge his wife&#x27;s death in an act of utu. This became known as the Wairau Affray or until modern times, the Wairau massacre, as most of the Europeans were killed after the fighting had stopped.

Following fighting in the Hutt Valley in 1846, Governor George Grey arrested Te Rauparaha after British troops discovered he was receiving and sending secret instructions to the local Māori who were attacking settlers. In a surprise attack on his pa, Te Rauparaha, who was now quite elderly, was captured and taken prisoner of war. The government held him as a prisoner for 10 months and then kept him under house arrest in Auckland on board a prison ship, the &quot;Driver&quot;. After his capture fighting stopped in the Wellington region. Te Rauparaha was released to attend a Māori peace conference at Kohimaramara in Auckland and then given his liberty after giving up any claim to the Wairau valley. Te Rauparaha&#x27;s last notable achievement came with the construction of Rangiātea Church (1846) in Ōtaki. He did not adopt Christianity, although he attended church services.

Te Rauparaha died on 27 November 1849. Many remember him as the author of the haka &quot;Ka Mate&quot;, which he composed after being hidden in a pit after a defeat in battle.

==Tribal sayings==

A saying delineates the tribe&#x27;s historical boundaries in central New Zealand:

The tribe lives mainly around Porirua and Nelson. An aphorism links tribal identity with ancestors and landmarks:

== &quot;Ka Mate&quot; haka ==
Concern over inappropriate commercial use of Te Rauparaha&#x27;s &quot;Ka Mate&quot; led the iwi to attempt to trademark it, but in 2006 the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand turned their claim down on the grounds that &quot;Ka Mate&quot; had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader.

In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the New Zealand government agreed to:
:... record the authorship and significance of the haka Ka Mate to Ngāti Toa and ... work with Ngāti Toa to address their concerns with the haka... [but] does not expect that redress will result in royalties for the use of Ka Mate or provide Ngāti Toa with a veto on the performance of Ka Mate ...

In November2021, tribal elders told anti-Covid-vaccine protesters in New Zealand to stop using the &quot;KaMate&quot; haka at their rallies.

==Marae and wharenui==

There are four marae (communal places) and wharenui (meeting houses) affiliated with Ngāti Toa:
* Hongoeka Marae (including Te Heke Mai Raro wharenui), Plimmerton
* Takapuwahia Marae (including Toa Rangatira wharenui), Porirua
* Wairau Marae (including Wairau wharenui), Spring Creek
* Whakatū Marae (including Kākāti wharenui), Nelson

==Governance==

Te Runanga o Toa Rangatira Inc is recognised by the New Zealand Government as the governance entity of Ngāti Toa following its Treaty of Waitangi settlement with the Crown under Ngāti Toa Rangatira Claims Settlement Act 2014. It is a mandated iwi organisation under the Māori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an &quot;iwi authority&quot; under the Resource Management Act, and a Tūhono organisation.

Te Runanga o Toa Rangatira is an incorporated society, governed by a board of 15 representatives, including three elected from iwi whānui, some appointed from Hamilton, Nelson and Wairau, and some appointed from marae and other Ngāti Toa organisations. As of 2016, the iwi chairperson is Taku Parai, the executive director is Matiu Rei, and the society is based in Porirua.

Wellington pan-tribal Māori radio station Te Upoko O Te Ika has been affiliated to Ngāti Toa since 2014. It began part-time broadcasting in 1983 and full-time broadcasting in 1987, and it is New Zealand&#x27;s longest-running Māori radio station. Atiawa Toa FM is an official radio station of Ngāti Toa and Te Atiawa. It began as Atiawa FM in 1993, broadcasting to Te Atiawa in the Hutt Valley and Wellington. It changed its name in Atiawa Toa FM in mid-1997, expanding its reach to Ngāti Toa in Porirua and Kāpiti Coast.

Ngāti Toa have interests in the territories of Greater Wellington Regional Council, Tasman District Council, Nelson City Council and Marlborough District Council. They also have interests in the territories of Kāpiti Coast District Council, Porirua City Council and Wellington City Council.

<text>The Canadian Jewish Congress (, , ) was, for more than ninety years, the main advocacy group for the Jewish community in Canada. Regarded by many as the &quot;Parliament of Canadian Jewry,&quot; the Congress was at the forefront of the struggle for human rights, equality, immigration reform and civil rights in Canada.

The organization disbanded in July 2011 following a reorganization of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, of which the CJA became a subsidiary in 2007.

==History==
===Founding and early history===

The immediate predecessor to the CJC was formed in 1915 by the Montreal chapter of Poalei Zion, a working class Labour Zionist organization. They were soon joined by thirteen other organizations, mostly other chapters of Poalei Zion and the Arbeiter Ring, in forming the Canadian Jewish Alliance. The organization, composed of elected officials, set out to represent all of Canadian Jewry on its major political, national and international affairs. It also aimed to respond to problems arising from the First World War, specifically the oppression of Jews overseas, the immigration of Jewish refugees, and Britain&#x27;s promises to create a Jewish state.

In 1919, over 25,000 Jews from across Canada voted for delegates to the first convention of the CJC held in Montreal that March. Groups including the Canadian Federation of Zionist Societies, Poalei Zion, Mizrachi, and the Arbeiter Ring were present at the convention. While there, they were addressed by the Solicitor General of Canada, and were entertained at Montreal City Hall, where a large Zionist flag was draped over the Mayor&#x27;s chair. The main decision at that meeting was the founding of the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society to assist Jewish settlers and refugees in Canada. They also passed motions expressing the Jewish community&#x27;s loyalty to Canada and others declaring their support for the Balfour Declaration. The convention elected Lyon Cohen, former President of the Montreal Clothing Manufacturers Union, as their President.

Despite this auspicious start, the CJC fell into abeyance and was inactive until 1934, due to lack of leadership and funding. With the rise in antisemitism and restricted immigration policies in the 1930s, the CJC re-convened in 1934 and held the Congress&#x27; second plenum in Toronto in January. Cohen&#x27;s friend and close colleague, Samuel William Jacobs, a prominent Jewish leader and Member of Parliament, became the revived Congress&#x27; first president.

In 1938, the Canadian Jewish Congress partnered with B&#x27;nai Brith Canada to create the Joint Public Relations Committee, with the goal of developing a strategy to combat discrimination and find allies within other minority groups.

===Post–World War II===

The CJC was active before and during World War II in lobbying the government (with limited success) to open the borders to Jewish refugees fleeing Europe. After the war, over 1,100 child Holocaust survivors immigrated to Canada in the War Orphans Project, a refugee resettlement program administered by the CJC. The CJC also organized relief aid for Holocaust survivors who were being detained in Displaced Persons camps. Along with the efforts of Senator Arthur Roebuck and Rabbi Avraham Aharon Price, the CJC helped obtain the release of young, Jewish refugees from internment camps, bringing them to study in Toronto.

The Congress&#x27; dominant figure from 1939 to 1962 was its president, Samuel Bronfman who was elected president following Jacobs&#x27; death in 1938. During the Cold War at Bronfman&#x27;s urging, the CJC expelled the United Jewish People&#x27;s Order and other communist Jewish organizations in 1951. At the time, the UJPO was one of the largest Jewish fraternal organizations in Canada. It would not be readmitted to the CJC until 1995.

In 1967, the CJC gifted approximately 7,000 volumes of rare Judaica to the National Library on behalf of the Canadian Jewish community in honour of the Canadian Centennial.

During the war between Israel and Lebanon in 1982, former Prime Minister Joe Clark issued a public rebuke to the CJC at its annual policy convention for its stance of unconditionally supporting the State of Israel in that war. During the speech, Clark was interrupted with heckles from the crowd and approximately 50 people left the room in protest. Near the end of his remarks, the audience began to sing &quot;Hatikvah&quot;, the Israeli national anthem.

One of the initiatives sponsored by the CJC was the International Jewish Correspondence, founded in 1978, whose goal was to link Jews around the world as pen-pals. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, IJC became less active and had folded by 2002. The organization also provided addresses for Jews living in Arab and Soviet Bloc countries as well as Jewish prisoners who were put in contact with others in the same situation. Jewish people from nearly 20 countries participated in the initiative, including those with declining Jewish populations such as Estonia, Morocco and Zimbabwe.

===Later history and disbandment===
In its later decades, the CJC launched campaigns to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jewish emigration, to pressure the Canadian government to prosecute Nazi war criminals who had settled in Canada, and to enact and use hate crimes legislation against antisemites and Holocaust deniers such as Ernst Zündel. The CJC actively opposed Quebec separatism in the 1990s and formed a national coalition of Canada&#x27;s Italian, Greek and Jewish communities during the debate on the Charlottetown Accord. The CJC also worked to promote tolerance and understanding between religious and ethnic groups, promote anti-racist work and other campaigns.

The CJC introduced significant changes to its internal organization in June 2007. The previous system of electing representatives to the Board of Directors was discarded, and a new system was introduced wherein Board members were chosen by indirect elections from &quot;regional Congress representatives&quot; and &quot;delegates from Jewish federations.&quot; Congress CEO Bernie Farber supported the change, arguing it would streamline a complicated process. Others argued that the new system would give disproportionate power to the Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy. One individual, described by &quot;The Canadian Jewish News&quot; as a &quot;close observer of Congress&quot;, argued that CIJA was &quot;stacking the deck&quot; in a bid to take over the CJC.

In 2011, the renamed Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) assumed the functions of the CJC after an 18-month restructuring process in which the functions of the Canadian Jewish Congress, the Canada-Israel Committee, the Quebec-Israel Committee, National Jewish Campus Life and the University Outreach Committee were consolidated, a move that left the Jewish community divided. On 1 July 2011 the CJC posted a message on its website declaring that it had halted its activities and that its functions would be assumed by CIJA.

<text>Garibaldi is a Mexican pop group, that wore a free version of the traditional charro costume while singing modern versions of traditional songs. Their dress and style of music caused controversy in their time. The name Garibaldi comes from Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City where mariachi bands can be found. The group remained active from 1988 through 1994, although it continues to be active as of 2023 with new members. The group was created by Mexican TV producer Luis de Llano Macedo during the celebration of the 175 years of Mexican Independence in the musical festival held in Acapulco, Guerrero.

==Reunion==

In 1999 the group reunited to record &quot;Reunion 10&quot;, in celebration of 10 years from their commencement. The group was dissolved months later after a mild reception from the public.

In 2010 the group reunited for a second time to record Garibaldi Bicentenario, in celebration of the 200 years of Mexican Independence. However, two of the original members abandoned the reunion project. At first, Víctor Noriega did not appear in the production release citing work exhaustion due to the completion of a recent soap opera. Patricia Manterola followed citing other work commitments as the cause of her departure. The remaining six members did perform a tour throughout Mexico and USA including the celebration of the Independence Day at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas on September 17, 2010.

<text>Jorge Campos Navarrete (born 15 October 1966) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

A notable player of Mexico in the 1990s and early 2000s, Campos was an eccentric player, known for his constant play outside the penalty area – often functioning as a sweeper-keeper, as well as his acrobatic, risky, and flamboyant style of goalkeeping, and his colourful playing attire. His main strengths as a goalkeeper were his leaping ability, athleticism, and speed when rushing off his line, as well as his ability to organize his defense, which enabled him to overcome his short stature. He was regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.

Campos also made for an effective striker, an example of versatility that is rarely seen in football. At times, he would start a game in goal, and transfer upfield later in the match, mostly at the club level. In total, he scored 35 goals throughout his career, scoring all but one while playing for UNAM. His trademark, self-designed bright kits contributed to his popularity.

==Club career==
Born in Acapulco, Campos started his career in 1988 in Mexico with Pumas. At that time the club&#x27;s first string goalkeeper was Adolfo Ríos, so because Campos desired first-team opportunities, he asked to be used as a striker. He performed notably in his first season, scoring 14 goals and contending for the title of top-goal scorer. In the following seasons he earned the position of first-choice goalkeeper and won the 1990–91 championship with Pumas.

He also won the championship with Cruz Azul in the Primera División de México Invierno 1997 (México First Division Winter 1997), although he was the second string goalkeeper to Óscar Pérez. He was regularly used as a substitute striker during this period.

As well as Pumas and Cruz Azul, Campos also played for such clubs Atlante, Tigres, and Puebla. He scored a notable bicycle kick goal for Atlante in the 1997 season. In that game, he started as goalkeeper, but as the forwards were failing to score a goal, the coach replaced a field player with another goalkeeper to send Campos to the attack.

He also played in the United States, where he starred in Major League Soccer&#x27;s first three seasons for the Los Angeles Galaxy and Chicago Fire. He was the first major foreign star to be signed by the league, and enjoyed considerable popularity in the United States. Campos played in back-to-back matches during a double-header event at the Rose Bowl on 16 June 1996, playing for Mexico against the United States and then the Galaxy against Tampa Bay.

==International career==
On the international stage, Campos started as goalkeeper for Mexico in two FIFA World Cup tournaments: 1994 and 1998. He was also called up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup but he did not play in the tournament. He would eventually collect 129 caps.

At the 1999 New Year&#x27;s Cup in Hong Kong, in which Mexico was invited as well as Egypt and Bulgaria, Campos&#x27; father was kidnapped in Mexico and Campos returned to Mexico to attend to the matter.
Campos was invited several times to play with the &quot;Rest of the World Team&quot; against clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Milan. His last game with Mexico was in 2004 in a friendly against Tecos.

He was selected as one of 3 overage players on the Mexico Olympic team at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

==Managerial career==
Campos served as the assistant manager to Ricardo La Volpe during his tenure with Mexico.

==Legacy==

Campos has appeared in commercials for the American sportswear company Nike. In 1996, wearing a black jersey (in contrast to the colorful jerseys he wore in games), Campos starred in a Nike commercial titled &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside football players from around the world, including Ronaldo, Paolo Maldini, Eric Cantona, Luís Figo and Patrick Kluivert, they defend &quot;the beautiful game&quot; against a team of demonic warriors, before it culminates with Cantona striking the ball and destroying evil.

Campos has appeared in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, featuring in the Classic XI for &quot;2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&quot;, &quot;FIFA 11&quot;, &quot;FIFA 12&quot;, &quot;FIFA 13&quot;, &quot;FIFA 15&quot; and &quot;FIFA 16&quot;. He also appeared in FIFA 23, FC 24 and FC 25&#x27;s Ultimate Team section, as a FUT Heroes Card.

Campos is also a commentator for TV Azteca.

<doc id="916659" wikidata="Q1529758" url="?curid=916659" title="Glass Houses (album)">
<text>Glass Houses is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on March 12, 1980. The record was a commercial success, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for six consecutive weeks. It features Joel&#x27;s first single to peak at on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart, &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;. It was ranked on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s 1980 year-end chart. The album is the 41st best-selling album of the 1980s, with sales of 7.1 million copies in the US alone. In 1981, Joel won a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for his work on &quot;Glass Houses&quot;. According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album featured &quot;a harder-edged sound&quot; compared to Joel&#x27;s other work, in response to the punk and new wave movements. This was also the final studio album to feature the original incarnation (Joel, Richie Cannata, Doug Stegmeyer, Russell Javors and Liberty DeVitto) of the Billy Joel Band, augmented by new lead guitarist David Brown. Multi-instrumentalist Cannata left the band just before the sessions began for Joel&#x27;s next studio album, 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot;.

== Background ==
This album was the third collaboration between Joel and producer Phil Ramone, following &quot;The Stranger&quot; and &quot;52nd Street&quot; and the final such collaboration in association with Home Run.

Opening with the sound of glass shattering, &quot;Glass Houses&quot; has more of a hard rock feel than Joel&#x27;s previous albums. The cover shows Joel poised to throw a rock through the two-story window of his real-life waterfront glass house in Cove Neck. On some versions, the back cover shows Joel looking through the hole that the rock made in the glass. This alludes to the adage that &quot;people in glass houses shouldn&#x27;t throw stones&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Paul Nelson stated: &quot;Billy Joel writes smooth and cunning melodies, and what many of his defenders say is true: his material&#x27;s catchy. But then, so&#x27;s the flu.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), Robert Christgau said: &quot;From the straight-up hubba-hubba of &#x27;You May Be Right&#x27; to the Rick Wakeman ostinatos of &#x27;Sometimes a Fantasy&#x27; to the McCartneyesque melodicism of &#x27;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Why&#x27; to the what-it-is of &#x27;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me,&#x27; it&#x27;s all rock and roll to him, but to me it&#x27;s closer to what pop meant before ironists and aesthetes, including yours truly, appropriated the term. Closer than any skinny-tie bands, that&#x27;s for sure: gregarious, shameless, and above all profitable. Of course, if it doesn&#x27;t make up in reach what it lacks in edge, ironists and aesthetes needn&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s there. And beyond &#x27;Sleeping With the Television On,&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t tell you thing one about side two, which I just played three times.&quot;

In 2004, the pop-culture journalist and rock critic Chuck Klosterman praised the album in an essay on Joel titled &quot;Every Dog Must Have His Every Day, Every Drunk Must Have His Drink&quot; from his book &quot;Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs&quot; (the title of the essay refers to a line from the &quot;Glass Houses&quot; song &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Why&quot;). Klosterman praised some of the more obscure tracks from the album including &quot;All for Leyna&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Alone&quot;, &quot;Sleeping with the Television On&quot; and &quot;Close to the Borderline&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: &quot;It may not be punk – then again, it may be his concept of punk – but &quot;Glass Houses&quot; is the closest Joel ever got to a pure rock album.&quot;

<text>Jules Joseph Lefebvre (; 14 March 183624 February 1911) was a French painter, educator and theorist.

==Early life==
Lefebvre was born in Tournan-en-Brie, Seine-et-Marne, on 14 March 1836. He entered the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in 1852 and was a pupil of Léon Cogniet.

==Career==
He won the prestigious Prix de Rome with his &quot;The Death of Priam&quot; in 1861. Between 1855 and 1898, he exhibited 72 portraits in the Paris Salon. Many of his paintings are single figures of beautiful women. Among the portraits of his considered the best were those of M. L. Reynaud and the Prince Imperial (1874). In 1891, he became a member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts.

He was professor at the Académie Julian in Paris. Lefebvre is chiefly important as an excellent and sympathetic teacher who numbered many Americans among his 1500 or more pupils. Among his famous students were Fernand Khnopff, Kenyon Cox, Félix Vallotton, Ernst Friedrich von Liphart, Georges Rochegrosse, the Scottish-born landscape painter William Hart, Walter Lofthouse Dean, and Edmund C. Tarbell, who became an American Impressionist painter. Another pupil was the miniaturist Alice Beckington as was Laura Leroux-Revault, the daughter of his friend Louis Hector Leroux. Jules Benoit-Lévy entered his workshop at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts.


Lefebvre died in Paris on 24 February 1911 and was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery with a bas-relief depiction of his painting &quot;La Vérité&quot; on his grave.

<doc id="916662" wikidata="Q950722" url="?curid=916662" title="Luis de Alba">
<text>Luis Alba Garcia (born March 7, 1945 in Veracruz) is a Mexican comedian, famous for his character &quot;El Pirrurris&quot; (the presumptuous son of a millionaire). He also made other characters such as &quot;El Raton Crispin&quot; (Crispin The Mouse) in which he dressed as a big fat rat from Veracruz. His typical line was, &quot;Te odio con odio Jarocho&quot;, which means &quot;I hate you with Jarocho (meaning from Veracruz) hatred&quot;. El Indio Maclovio and Juan Penas were also two very famous characters he acted out on several shows.

His most famous TV program was &quot;El Mundo De Luis de Alba&quot;, (&quot;The World Of Luis de Alba&quot;), where &quot;El Pirrurris&quot; and other characters regularly appeared. After this program was canceled he spent many years away from television but retransmissions of the show were popular. In 2004 he came back portraying the &quot;Pirrurris&quot; once again in one of Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo&#x27;s adult-oriented comedy shows, set in a primary school where the students are played by adult actors. In 2005 he got a new show where he plays the &quot;Pirrurris&quot; as well as his other characters. He is currently appearing in a show called &quot;Los Chuperamigos&quot; in Estrella TV with other actors such as &quot;La Chupitos&quot;.

==Characters==

===&quot;El Pirrurris&quot;===
Created sometime in the 1970s, the character is a very rich young man with a haircut similar to that used by the Beatles in their early years and depicts sarcastically and exaggeratedly the stereotype of a so-called &quot;fresa&quot;. He enjoys deprecating low- to middle-class people with illusions of grandeur, airs of importance, bad taste, and colorful (low class) slang, while at the same time emphasizing his own importance and class-superiority, using a lot of &quot;high class&quot; slang. The people he deprecates are pejoratively called &quot;nacos&quot;. &quot;Pirrurris&quot; refined the ridicule of nacos into &quot;nacology&quot;, the study of the &quot;naco&quot;. Sitting behind a desk, he would explain the &quot;naco&quot; to his audience in scientific terms.

So viewers would not take his remarks seriously, the character&#x27;s locution and mannerisms are a parody of the so-called &quot;juniors&quot;, the pompous young sons of upper-class Mexicans, known for their tendency to dismiss anyone else as a &quot;naco&quot;. He frequently refers to his millionaire &quot;Papi&quot; and expresses amazement at the most mundane problems faced by normal people. Incredibly narcissistic, he explains that his name comes from the mathematical constant pi and &quot;rorro&quot; (slang for handsome), in that he is &quot;3.1416 times handsome&quot;.

&quot;Pirrurris&quot; has become a common Mexican epithet for someone who looks down on others, is a materialist and superficial but however non-intelligent and air-headed (although not aware of this), and act as if one were above one&#x27;s real economic station. Mexican leftist politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador has used the term on different occasions to refer to his right-wing political opponents.

Luis de Alba started his artistic life when he was a child playing a character named &quot;Solin&quot;. Solin was the always companion of a supposed man with gifted powers (Kaliman). Kaliman was the name of a daytime radio drama transmitted to audiences exclusively by radio in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

<doc id="916664" wikidata="Q2542444" url="?curid=916664" title="Welsh Triads">
<text>The Welsh Triads (, &quot;Triads of the Island of Britain&quot;) are a group of related texts in medieval manuscripts which preserve fragments of Welsh folklore, mythology and traditional history in groups of three. The triad is a rhetorical form whereby objects are grouped together in threes, with a heading indicating the point of likeness; for example, &quot;Three things not easily restrained, the flow of a torrent, the flight of an arrow, and the tongue of a fool.&quot;

==Contents==
The texts include references to King Arthur and other semi-historical characters from sub-Roman Britain, mythic figures such as Brân the Blessed, undeniably historical personages such as Alan IV, Duke of Brittany (who is called &quot;Alan Fyrgan&quot;) and Iron Age characters such as Caswallawn (Cassivellaunus) and Caradoc (Caratacus).

Some triads simply give a list of three characters with something in common (such as &quot;the three frivolous bards of the island of Britain&quot;) while others include substantial narrative explanation. The triad form probably originated amongst the Welsh bards or poets as a mnemonic aid in composing their poems and stories, and later became a rhetorical device of Welsh literature. The Medieval Welsh tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; has many triads embedded in its narrative.

===Examples===

As edited and translated by Rachel Bromwich, two characteristic examples of the Welsh triads are:
36. Teir Gormes a doeth y&#x27;r Enys Hon, ac nyt aeth vrun dracheuyn:
Ỽn o nadunt Kywdaỽt y Corryanyeit, a doethant eman yn oes Caswallawn mab Beli, ac nyt aeth ỽn un onadunt dracheuyn. Ac or Auia pan hanoedynt.&lt;br&gt;
Eil, Goemes y Gwydyl Fychti. Ac nyt aeth ỽr un onadunt dracheuyn.&lt;br&gt;
Tryded, Gormes y Saesson, a Hors a Hengyst yn benaduryeit arnadunt.

:Three Oppressions that came to this Island, and not one of them went back:
One of them (was) the people of the Cor(y)aniaid, who came here in the time of Caswallawn son of Beli: and not one of them went back. And they came from Arabia.&lt;br&gt;
The second Oppression: the Gwyddyl Ffichti. And not one of them went back.&lt;br&gt;
The third Oppression: the Saxons, with Horsa and Hengist as their leaders.

46. Teir Pryf Uuch Enys Prydein:
Brech, buwch ỽaelgỽn Gwyned,&lt;br&gt;
a Thonnllwyt, buwch meibyon Eliffer Godgordỽawr,&lt;br&gt;
a Chornillo, buỽch Llawuroded ỽarỽaỽc.
:Three Principal Cows of the Island of Britain:
Speckled, cow of Maelgwn Gwynedd,&lt;br&gt;
and Grey-Skin, cow of the sons of Eliffer of the Great Warband,&lt;br&gt;
and Cornillo, cow of Llawfrodedd the Bearded.

==Earliest surviving collection==
The earliest surviving collection of the Welsh Triads is bound in the manuscript &quot;Peniarth 16&quot;, now at the National Library of Wales, which has been dated to the third quarter of the 13th century and contains 46 of the 96 triads collated by Rachel Bromwich. Other important manuscripts include &quot;Peniarth 45&quot; (written about 1275), and the pair White Book of Rhydderch (Welsh: &quot;Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch&quot;) and Red Book of Hergest (Welsh: &quot;Llyfr Coch Hergest&quot;), which share a common version clearly different from the version behind the collections in the Peniarth manuscripts.

==Later collections==
The 18th-century Welsh antiquarian Iolo Morganwg compiled a collection of triads, which he claimed to have taken from his own collection of manuscripts. Some of his triads are similar to those found in the medieval manuscripts, but some are unique to Morganwg, and are widely believed to have been of his own invention.

<doc id="916669" wikidata="Q621076" url="?curid=916669" title="Self-immolation">
<text>Self-immolation is the act of setting oneself on fire. It is mostly done for political or religious reasons, often as a form of protest or in acts of martyrdom. Due to its disturbing and violent nature, it is considered one of the most extreme methods of protest.

== Etymology ==

The English word &quot;&quot; originally meant (1534) &quot;killing a sacrificial victim; sacrifice&quot; and came to figuratively mean (1690) &quot;destruction, especially by fire&quot;. Its etymology was from Latin &quot;to sprinkle with sacrificial meal (mola salsa); to sacrifice&quot; in ancient Roman religion. In the Mewar region of India, women practiced a form of self-immolation called &quot;Jauhar&quot; to avoid being raped by invading armies.

==Effects==
Self-immolators frequently use accelerants before igniting themselves. This, combined with the self-immolators&#x27; refusal to protect themselves, can produce hotter flames and deeper, more extensive burns.
Self-immolation has been described as excruciatingly painful. Later the burns become severe, nerves are burnt and the self-immolator loses sensation at the burnt areas. Some self-immolators can die during the act from inhalation of toxic combustion products, hot air, and flames.

The human body has an inflammatory response to burnt skin, which happens after 25% is burnt in adults. This response leads to blood and body fluid loss. If the self-immolator is not taken to a burn centre in less than four hours, they are more likely to die from shock. If no more than 80% of their body area is burnt and the self-immolator is younger than 40 years old, there is a survival chance of 50%. If the self-immolator has over 80% burns, the survival rate drops to 20%.

==History==
Self-immolation is tolerated by some elements of Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism, and it has been practiced for many centuries, especially in India, for various reasons, including &quot;jauhar&quot;, political protest, devotion, and renouncement. An example from mythology includes the practice of Sati when the Hindu goddess Parvati&#x27;s incarnation of the same name (see also Daksayani) legendarily set herself on fire after her father insulted her in Daksha Yajna for having married Shiva, the ascetic god. Shiva and the army of ghosts attacked Daksha&#x27;s Yajna and destroyed the sacrifice, and Shiva beheaded and killed Daksha. Later, Daksha was revived by Shiva and Daksha Yajna was completed when Daksha apologized. Certain warrior cultures, such as those of the Charans and Rajputs, also practiced self-immolation.

There are several well-known examples from antiquity to modern times. Kalanos, also spelled Calanus () ( – 323 BCE), was an ancient Indian gymnosophist, and philosopher from Taxila who accompanied Alexander the Great to Persis and later, after falling ill, self-immolated by entering into a pyre, in front of Alexander and his army. Diodorus Siculus called him Caranus ().
Zarmanochegas was a monk of the Sramana tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius, met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch around 22 BC and burnt himself to death in Athens shortly thereafter.

The monk Fayu () (d. 396) carried out the earliest recorded Chinese self-immolation. He first informed the &quot;illegitimate&quot; prince Yao Xu ()—brother of Yao Chang who founded the non-Chinese Qiang state Later Qin (384–417)—that he intended to burn himself alive. Yao tried to dissuade Fayu, but he publicly swallowed incense chips, wrapped his body in oiled cloth, and chanted while setting fire to himself. The religious and lay witnesses were described as being &quot;full of grief and admiration&quot;.

Following Fayu&#x27;s example, many Buddhist monks and nuns have used self-immolation for political purposes. While some monks did offer their bodies in periods of relative prosperity and peace, there is a &quot;marked coincidence&quot; between acts of self-immolation and times of crisis, especially when secular powers were hostile towards Buddhism. For example, Daoxuan&#x27;s (c. 667) &quot;Xu Gaoseng Zhuan&quot; () records five monastics who self-immolated on the Zhongnan Mountains in response to the 574–577 persecution of Buddhism by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou (known as the &quot;Second Disaster of Wu&quot;).

For many monks and laypeople in Chinese history, self-immolation was a form of Buddhist practice that modeled and expressed a particular path that led towards Buddhahood.

Historian Jimmy Yu has stated that self-immolation cannot be interpreted based on Buddhist doctrine and beliefs alone but the practice must be understood in the larger context of the Chinese religious landscape. He examines many primary sources from the 16th and 17th century and demonstrates that bodily practices of self-harm, including self-immolation, were ritually performed not only by Buddhists but also by Daoists and literati officials who either exposed their naked body to the sun in a prolonged period of time as a form of self-sacrifice or burned themselves as a method of procuring rain.

During the Great Schism of the Russian Church, entire villages of Old Believers burned themselves to death in an act known as &quot;fire baptism&quot; (self-burners: &quot;samosozhigateli&quot;). A 1973 study by a prison doctor suggested that people who choose self-immolation as a form of suicide are more likely to be in a &quot;disturbed state of consciousness&quot;, such as epilepsy.

== Political protest ==

Regarding self-immolation as a form of political protest, the 14th Dalai Lama said in 2013 and 2015:

Self-immolations are often public and political statements that are often reported by the news media. They can be seen by others as a type of altruistic suicide for a collective cause, and are not intended to inflict physical harm on others or cause material damage.

=== South Vietnam Buddhist crisis ===
The Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam saw the persecution of the country&#x27;s majority religion under the administration of Catholic president Ngô Đình Diệm. Several Buddhist monks, including the most famous case of Thích Quảng Đức, immolated themselves in protest.

=== U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War ===
The example set by self-immolators in the mid 20th century sparked similar acts between 1963 and 1971, most of which occurred in Asia and the United States in conjunction with protests opposing the Vietnam War. Researchers counted almost 1000 self-immolations covered by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;.

On 2 November 1965, Norman Morrison, an anti-war activist, doused himself in kerosene and set himself on fire below the office of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara at the Pentagon, to protest United States involvement in the Vietnam War.

=== Soviet bloc ===

In 1968, the practice spread to the Soviet bloc with the self-immolation of Polish accountant and Armia Krajowa veteran Ryszard Siwiec, as well as those of two Czech students, Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc, and of toolmaker Evžen Plocek, in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

In 1972, Romas Kalanta, a 19-year-old Lithuanian student self-immolated to protest against the Soviet regime in Lithuania, sparking the 1972 unrest in Lithuania; another 13 people self-immolated in that same year.

In 1978, Ukrainian dissident and former political prisoner Oleksa Hirnyk burnt himself near the tomb of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko protesting against the russification of Ukraine under Soviet rule. On 2 March 1989, Liviu Cornel Babeș set himself on fire on the Bradu ski slope at Poiana Brașov as a sign of protest against the Communist regime.

=== India and Sri Lanka ===
In India, as many as 1,451 and 1,584 self-immolations were reported in 2000 and 2001, respectively. A particularly high wave of self-immolation was recorded during the Mandal Commission protests of 1990 against the caste-based system of reservation. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of self-immolators in India to date, although not all of them were politically motivated. Tamils in Indian and Sri Lanka have protested against the imposition of the Hindi language, the assassination of Indira Gandhi, and their mistreatment by the Sri Lankan government.

=== China and Tibet ===
As of June 2022, there had been 161 confirmed self-immolations in Tibet and ten others made in solidarity outside of Tibet. The 14th Dalai Lama placed the blame on &quot;cultural genocide&quot; by the Chinese. The Chinese government blamed the Dalai Lama and his supporters for inciting these acts. Several Tibetan scholars criticized the Dalai Lama for not speaking more strongly against self-immolations. In 2013, the Dalai Lama questioned the effectiveness of self-immolations but said they are caused by Beijing. The United States called on both sides to moderate their stance.

=== Arab Spring ===
A wave of self-immolation suicides occurred in conjunction with the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and North Africa, with at least 14 recorded incidents. The 2010–2011 Tunisian revolution was sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi. Other cases followed during the 2011 Algerian protests and the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

=== United States and the Israel-Hamas War ===
On 1 December 2023, a protester self-immolated in front of the Israeli consulate in Atlanta while draped in a Palestinian flag in response to the Israel–Hamas war.

On 25 February 2024, Aaron Bushnell, an active-duty U.S. Air Force service member, self-immolated outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., in protest against the United States&#x27; ongoing support for Israel. He lit himself on fire while shouting &quot;Free Palestine&quot;. It was filmed and livestreamed on Twitch. Bushnell died of his injuries on 26 February.

On 11 September 2024, a man named Matt Nelson self-immolated outside the Israeli consulate and the Four Seasons hotel in Boston, Massachusetts in protest of the United States&#x27; ongoing support for Israel. He recorded a video urging the United States government to stop sending weapons to Israel.

On 5 October 2024, a photojournalist named Samuel Mena Jr. attempted to self-immolate in front of the White House in Washington DC at a pro-Palestinian protest. He survived with burn injuries to his arm and was taken to a hospital.

<doc id="916673" wikidata="Q4216325" url="?curid=916673" title="Soup soy sauce">
<text>Soup soy sauce or &quot;guk-ganjang&quot; () is a type of Korean soy sauce () made entirely of fermented soybeans (&quot;meju&quot;) and brine. It is also a byproduct of &quot;doenjang&quot; production. Both lighter in colour and saltier than other Korean varieties, soup soy sauce is used mainly in &quot;guk&quot; (soup) and &quot;namul&quot; (a seasoned vegetable dish) in modern Korean cuisine.

== Names ==
Soup soy sauce is referred to by many different names. In the English-speaking world, it is most commonly known as &quot;soup soy sauce&quot;, which is a direct translation of (). The name &quot;soup soy sauce&quot; is used because it is used mainly for soup in modern Korean cuisine. Also, it is the name used by many popular soy sauce brands such as Sempio, Daesang&#x27;s Chung Jung One, and CJ Cheil Jedang&#x27;s Beksul. Other names for the sauce include:
* &quot;Hansik ganjang&quot; () – &quot;Korean-style soy sauce&quot; is a name used by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.
* &quot;Jaeraesik ganjang&quot; () – &quot;traditional soy sauce&quot; is a name used for soup soy sauce when compared to &quot;gaeryang ganjang&quot; (, &quot;modernized soy sauce&quot;), which is now the most widely used (and considered &quot;regular&quot;) type of soy sauce in modern Korean cuisine.
* &quot;Joseon-ganjang&quot; () – &quot;Joseon soy sauce&quot; is a name used for soup soy sauce, when compared to &quot;Wae-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;Japanese soy sauce&quot;). The term &quot;Wae soy sauce&quot; is used to refer to modernized &quot;gaeryang ganjang&quot;, which was introduced to Korea during the era of Japanese forced occupation.
* &quot;Jip-ganjang&quot; () – &quot;home soy sauce&quot; is a name used for home-brewed soup soy sauce.

== History ==
The earliest soy sauce brewing in Korea seems to have begun prior to the era of the Three Kingdoms. The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, a Chinese historical text written and published in the 3rd century, mentions that &quot;Goguryeo people are good at brewing fermented soy beans&quot;, in the section called &quot;Dongyi&quot; (Eastern foreigners), in the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;. Jangdoks used for soy sauce brewing are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No. 3 from 4th century Goguryeo.

In &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is mentioned that &quot;ganjang&quot; and &quot;doenjang&quot; along with &quot;meju&quot; and &quot;jeotgal&quot; were prepared for the wedding ceremony of King Sinmun in February 683. &quot;Sikhwaji&quot;, a section from &quot;Goryeosa&quot; (History of Goryeo), recorded that &quot;ganjang&quot; and &quot;doenjang&quot; were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as &quot;Guhwangchwaryo&quot; and &quot;Jeungbo sallim gyeongje&quot; contain detailed procedures on how to brew good-quality &quot;ganjang&quot; and &quot;doenjang.&quot; &quot;Gyuhap chongseo&quot; explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve &quot;ganjang&quot; and &quot;doenjang&quot;.

== Production ==

Soup soy sauce is made entirely of fermented soybeans and brine. The brewing process also produces &quot;doenjang&quot;, a Korean fermented bean paste.

&quot;Meju&quot;, Korean soybean brick, is made around &quot;ipdong&quot; in early November. Soybeans are soaked overnight, boiled in salt water, and then pounded in a mortar (&quot;jeolgu&quot;) or coarsely ground with a millstone. About a &quot;doe&quot; (≈1.8 litres) or two of pounded soybeans are chunked, compressed, and shaped into a cube or a sphere called &quot;meju&quot;. The meju bricks are then dried in a cool, shaded area for a week to several weeks until firm. When the bricks harden, they are tied with rice straws to the eaves of the house, or put in a warm ondol room with rice straw, to ferment. In Jeongwol, the first month of the lunar year, well-fermented &quot;meju&quot; bricks are washed and sun-dried.

After drying, the &quot;meju&quot; bricks are aged in &quot;onggi&quot; crocks (&quot;jangdok&quot;) with brine. Charcoal and chillies are added for their adsorbent and antibacterial properties, as well as folk-religious beliefs that they drive away evil spirits. As the fermentation progresses, the brine acquires flavour and colour. This aged brine is boiled to become &quot;ganjang&quot; (soy sauce), and the rest (aged &quot;meju&quot; chunks) is mashed to become &quot;doenjang&quot; (soybean paste).

== Types ==
The Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety&#x27;s &quot;Food Code&quot; classifies &quot;hansik ganjang&quot; into two categories by their ingredients:
* &quot;Jaerae-hansik-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;traditional Korean-style soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce made with traditional style &quot;meju&quot; and brine. 
* &quot;Gaeryang-hansik-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;modernized Korean-style soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce made with non-traditional &quot;meju&quot; (which can be made of regular soybean, rice, barley, wheat, or degreased soybean, and ripened using traditional method or aspergillus) and saline solution.

Depending on the length of aging, &quot;hansik ganjang&quot; can be divided into three main varieties: clear, middle, and dark.
* &quot;Haet-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;new soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce aged for a year. Also called &quot;cheongjang&quot; (, &quot;clear soy sauce&quot;).
* &quot;Jung-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;middle soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce aged for three to four years.
* &quot;Jin-ganjang&quot; (, &quot;dark soy sauce&quot;) – soy sauce aged for more than five years. Also called &quot;jinjang&quot; (, &quot;aged soy sauce&quot;), &quot;nongjang&quot; (, &quot;thick soy sauce&quot;), or &quot;jingamjang&quot; (, &quot;aged mature soy sauce&quot;).

<text>Wu Hui-ju (; born 12 November 1982 in Tainan) is an athlete from Republic of China. She competes in archery.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Wu represented the Republic of China (as Chinese Taipei) at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She placed 10th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 649. In the first round of elimination, she faced 55th-ranked Narguis Nabieva of Tajikistan. Wu defeated Nabieva 156–142 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced 23rd-ranked German archer Anja Hitzler, defeating her 9–8 in a tie-breaker after the first 18 arrows resulted in a tie at 156. Wu then defeated 7th-ranked Justyna Mospinek of Poland 160–151, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Wu faced Lee Sung Jin of Korea, losing to the 2nd-ranked and eventual silver medalist archer. The final score of 104–103 in the 12 arrow match placed Wu 6th overall in women&#x27;s individual archery. Wu was also a member of the team that won the bronze medal for Chinese Taipei in the women&#x27;s team archery competition.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Wu finished her ranking round with a total of 634 points. This gave her the 29th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Leydis Brito in the first round. The 36th seeded archer from Venezuela was too strong with 104-98 and advanced to the next round. Together with Yuan Shu-Chi and Wei Pi-Hsiu she also took part in the team event. With her 634 score from the ranking round combined with the 652 of Yuan and the 585 of Wei the Chinese Taipei team was in eighth position after the ranking round. In the first round they faced the Italian team, but were unable to beat them. Italy advanced to the quarter-finals with a 215–211 score.

<text>The Holden Apollo is a compact and later mid-size car that was distributed from 1989 to 1997 in Australia by Holden. As a successor to the GM-engineered Holden Camira, the Apollo was a badge engineered version of the Toyota Camry, also sold in Australia. In paralleling two generations of the Camry—the V20 coded as the JK and facelifted JL series Apollo—and the XV10 recoded as the JM and updated JP—there were minor cosmetic differences in the grille, lights and trim.

This model sharing occurred due to the United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI) joint venture between Toyota Australia and Holden starting in 1987 that resulted in model sharing between both automakers from August 1989. UAAI was in turn a result of the Button car plan, which aimed to make the Australian motor business more efficient and eliminate import tariffs. Production ceased in late 1996, although enough cars remained until the replacement Holden Vectra arrived in mid-1997. It was produced at Toyota&#x27;s Port Melbourne plant until 1994 and then at Altona.

<doc id="916702" wikidata="Q204950" url="?curid=916702" title="Rosser Reeves">
<text>Rosser Reeves (10 September 1910 – 24 January 1984) was an American advertising executive and pioneer of television advertising; Reeves generated millions for his clients. The Ted Bates agency, where he rose to chairman, exists today as Bates CHI &amp; Partners.

==Early life and start in advertising==
Reeves was born in Virginia to a Methodist preacher, and briefly attended the University of Virginia until he was expelled for drunkenly crashing a friend&#x27;s car during the Prohibition era. Luckily, he had just won one hundred dollars as a prize for a state-wide chemistry contest that served as his final exam for first year Chem 101. While other students wrote novel chemical formulae as their submission, Reeves, by virtue of not knowing anything about chemistry having spent the semester drinking, dancing and gambling, blithely submitted an essay titled &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot;. He would later use this title for DuPont Corporation campaign. The one hundred dollars was enough money to move to Richmond where he was hired at a new bank that was hiring young contest winners. Finding that he was a poor accountant but verbally gifted, he began writing advertisements. He soon moved to New York City to found Ted Bates &amp; Co with Ted Bates.

==Advertising style==
Reeves believed the purpose of advertising is to sell. He insisted that an advertisement or commercial should show off the value or unique selling proposition, (or USP) of a product, not the cleverness or humor of a copywriter. His most typical ad is probably that for Anacin, a headache medicine. The ad was considered grating and annoying by almost all viewers but it was remarkably successful, tripling the product&#x27;s sales. In 7 years the 59-second commercial made more money than the movie &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; had in a quarter-century.

His ads were focused around what he coined the unique selling proposition, the one reason the product needed to be bought or was better than its competitors. These often took the form of slogans — Reeves oversaw the introduction of dozens, some that still exist to this day, such as M&amp;M&#x27;s &quot;melts in your mouth, not in your hand.&quot; He argued that advertising campaigns should be unchanging with a single slogan for each product. His commercials for Bic pens, Minute Maid orange juice, M&amp;M&#x27;s candies, Colgate toothpaste and other products used similar methods, often making dramatic demonstrations.

Reeves pointed out that to work, advertising had to be honest. He insisted the product being sold actually be superior, and argued that no amount of advertising could move inferior goods. He also disagreed that advertising was able to create demand where it did not exist. Successful advertising for a flawed product would only increase the number of people who tried the product and became dissatisfied with it. If advertising is effective enough and a product flawed enough, the advertising will accelerate the destruction of the brand. Similarly, Reeves believed it was a waste of money to claim uniqueness that doesn&#x27;t exist, because consumers will soon find out, and they won&#x27;t come back to the brand. This is important because historically fortunes are made from repeat business. Money would be better spent building some kind of meaningful advantage into a product before launching a costly advertising campaign to promote it.

Reeves advised clients to be wary of brand image advertising which is less likely to be successful than his claim-based strategy. This is because when communication relies on an image, the claim is not articulated. An image can almost always be interpreted different ways, many if not most of which won&#x27;t do a product any good. The message that a viewer takes away from an image is often very different from what the advertiser had intended.

Or to put it another way: practically every product has a number of benefits that might be claimed. Commonly one of the benefits is more popular than the others, even more popular than the others combined. Therefore, it&#x27;s imperative to do everything to make people understand the most important benefit, to achieve credibility and to avoid distractions. The aim is to have as high a percentage of people as possible take out of an advertisement what the advertiser intends to put into it. This is most likely to be achieved if a claim is articulated and proven with credible evidence—in a brief commercial, some kind of dramatic demonstration.

Reeves is also notable for creating Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s presidential ads for the 1952 election. He packaged Eisenhower as a forthright, strong, yet friendly leader. The commercials all included a regular person asking a question to the upper right of the screen. They would cut to Eisenhower, not wearing glasses to look stronger, looking to the lower left and then turning to the camera and responding. They were created by letting Eisenhower speak for a number of hours. Then questions were crafted later that best fit his answers.

==Later years==
In the 1960s Reeves&#x27; techniques began to fail. Consumers became more savvy and learned to tune out uninteresting commercials, and within the advertising industry itself the Creative Revolution, exemplified by Doyle Dane Bernbach&#x27;s &quot;Think Small&quot; campaign for the Volkswagen Beetle. The Creative Revolution rejected many of his precepts though some might argue that the &quot;Think Small&quot; does conform to the rules set out in Reeves&#x27; book &quot;Reality in Advertising&quot; because it highlights what is most unusual about the Beetle, namely its small size and distinct shape. Reeves retired at age 55. He declared that he had always planned to retire at that age, but many of his competitors felt it was because of the decline in his influence.

He came out of retirement in 1967 to form the Tiderock Corporation, which he described as a &quot;think tank&quot; for corporate business.
One of its projects was a promotion in 1968 of a pro-smoking article by Stanley Frank published in &quot;True&quot; magazine. The promotion was paid for by the Tobacco Institute, who also paid Frank to write the article.
 This was common practice among advertising men of the time and wholly unremarkable from the perspective of 1960s-era business ethics. Reeves died of a heart attack on January 24, 1984, at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He was 73 years old.
In the late 1950s, Rosser Reeves bought the 138.72-carat star ruby, the largest star ruby ever. It is said that he carried the ruby around with him and that he considered it as his good luck charm. Mined in Sri Lanka, the original 140 carat ruby was cut down slightly to improve the star pattern in it. In 1965 Reeves donated the star ruby to the Smithsonian where it is currently on display in the Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.

==Published works==
Reeves expressed his views in his 1961 book, &quot;Reality in Advertising&quot; (Knopf) which is still taught at Harvard Business School. An interview with Reeves was included in &quot;The Art of Writing Advertising&quot; (1965). His greatest contributions were to express more clearly than anyone else the philosophy of a claim and to show how the philosophy could be applied to commercials that involve severe time constraints.

Reeves wrote a well received novel, &quot;Popo&quot; (Knopf) about a poet who leaves a life of material wealth to move to Greenwich Village in New York City, to pursue his poetry.

Reeves co-authored &quot;The 99 Critical Shots in Pool&quot; with Ray Martin to explain both Euclid and Sir Isaac Newtons&#x27; geometric proofs. 
Rosser Reeves&#x27; poem E=MC2 appeared in &quot;The Best From Fantasy and Science Fiction, Tenth Series&quot; in 1961. The editors commented:

<text>S Doradus (also known as S Dor) is one of the brightest stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located roughly 160,000 light-years away. The star is a luminous blue variable, and one of the most luminous stars known, having a luminosity varying widely above and below 1,000,000 times the luminosity of the Sun, although it is too far away to be seen with the naked eye.

==History==
S Doradus was noted in 1897 as an unusual and variable star, of Secchi type I with bright lines of Hα, Hβ, and Hγ. The formal recognition as a variable star came the assignment of the name S Doradus in 1904 in the second supplement to Catalogue of Variable Stars.

S Dor was observed many times over the following decades. In 1924, it was described as &quot;P Cygni class&quot; and recorded at photographic magnitude 9.5 In 1925, its absolute magnitude was estimated at −8.9. In 1933 it was listed as a 9th-magnitude Beq star with bright hydrogen lines. It was the most luminous star known at that time.

In 1943, the variability was interpreted as being due to eclipses of a binary companion, orbiting with a period of 40 years. This was refuted in 1956, when the variability was described as irregular and the spectrum as A0 with P Cygni profiles and emission for many spectral lines. The brightness was observed to decline by 0.8 magnitude from 1954 into 1955. At the same time, S Doradus was noted as being similar to the Hubble–Sandage variables, the LBVs discovered in M31 and M33. The brief 1955 minimum was followed by a deep minimum in 1964, when the spectrum was compared to Eta Carinae in strong contrast to the mid-A spectrum at normal brightness.

By 1969 the nature of S Doradus was still uncertain, considered possibly to be a pre-main-sequence star, but during the next decade the consensus settled on the S Doradus type variables and Hubble-Sandage variables being evolved massive supergiants. They were eventually given the name &quot;luminous blue variables&quot; in 1984, coined in part because of the similarity of the acronym LBV to the well-defined LPV class of variable stars. The classification system defined for the General Catalogue of Variable Stars pre-dated this and so the acronym SDOR is used for LBVs.

==Surroundings==

S Doradus is the brightest member of the open cluster NGC 1910, also known as the LH41 stellar association, visible in binoculars as a bright condensation within the main bar of the LMC. This is within the N119 emission nebula, which has a distinctive spiral shape. It is one of the visually brightest individual stars in the LMC, at some times the brightest. There are only a handful of other 9th-magnitude stars in the LMC, such as the yellow hypergiant HD 33579.

There are several compact clusters near S Doradus, within the general NGC 1910/LH41 association. The closest is less than four arc-minutes away, contains two out of the three WO stars in the entire LMC, and the entire cluster is about the same brightness as S Doradus. A little further away is NGC 1916. Another LBV, R85, is just two arc-minutes away. This rich star-forming region also hosts a third Wolf–Rayet star, at least ten other supergiants, and at least ten class O stars.

S Doradus has a number of close companion stars. The Washington Double Star Catalog lists two 11th-magnitude stars 5″ away, which at the distance of the LMC is about four light years. A much closer companion has been found using the Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor, 1.7″ away and four magnitudes fainter. There are other nearby stars, most notably a 12th-magnitude OB supergiant at 13″.

==Variability==

This star belongs to its own eponymous S Doradus class of variable stars, also designated as luminous blue variables or LBVs. LBVs exhibit long slow changes in brightness, punctuated by occasional outbursts. S Doradus is typically a magnitude 9 star, varying by a few tenths of a magnitude on timescales of a few months, superimposed on variations of about a magnitude taking several years. The extreme range of these variations is from about visual magnitude 8.6–10.4. Every few decades it shows a more dramatic decrease in brightness, to as low as magnitude 11.5. The nature of the variation is somewhat unusual for an LBV; S Doradus is typically in an outburst state, with only occasional fades to the quiescent state that is typical of most stars in the class.
The colour of S Doradus changes as its brightness varies, being bluest when the star is faintest. At the same time, the spectrum shows dramatic changes. It is typically an extreme mid-A supergiant with P Cygni profiles on many lines (e.g. A5eq or A2/3Ia+e). At maximum brightness, the spectrum can become as cool as an F supergiant, with strong ionised metal lines and almost no emission components. At minimum brightness, the spectrum is dominated by emission, particularly forbidden lines of Fe but also helium and other metals. At the deep minima these features are even more pronounced, and Fe emission also appears.

Attempts to identify regularity in the unpredictable changes of brightness suggest a period of around 100 days for the small amplitude variations near maximum brightness. At minimum brightness, these &quot;microvariations&quot; are considered to occur with periods as long as 195 days. The slower variations have been characterised with a period of 6.8 years, with an interval of 35–40 years between deep minima. The microvariations are similar to the brightness changes shown by α Cygni variables, which are less luminous hot supergiants.

==The instability strip==

S Doradus variables (LBVs) show distinct quiescent and outburst states. During the quiescent phase, LBVs lie along a diagonal band in the H–R diagram called the &quot;S Doradus Instability Strip&quot;, with the more luminous examples having hotter temperatures.

The standard theory is that LBV outbursts occur when the mass loss increases and an extremely dense stellar wind creates a pseudo-photosphere. The temperature drops until the wind opacity starts to decrease, meaning all LBV outbursts reach a temperature around 8,000–9,000 K. The bolometric luminosity during outbursts is considered to remain largely unchanged, but the visual luminosity increases as radiation shifts from the ultraviolet into the visual range. Detailed investigations have shown that some LBVs appear to change luminosity from minimum to maximum. S Doradus has been calculated to be less luminous at maximum brightness (minimum temperature), possibly as a result of potential energy going into expansion of a substantial portion of the star. AG Carinae and HR Carinae show similar luminosity decreases in some studies, but in the most convincing case AFGL 2298 increased its luminosity during its outbursts.

Rare larger eruptions can appear as long-lasting under-luminous supernovae, and have been termed supernova impostors. The cause of the eruptions is unknown, but the star survives and may experience multiple eruptions. Eta Carinae and P Cygni are the only known examples in the Milky Way, and S Doradus has not shown such an eruption.

==Stellar properties==

The temperature of an LBV is difficult to determine because the spectra are so peculiar and the standard colour calibrations don&#x27;t apply, so the luminosity changes associated with brightness variations cannot be calculated accurately. Within the margins of error, it has often been assumed that the luminosity stays constant during all LBV outbursts. This is likely if the outburst consists only of an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere to mimic a larger cooler star.

Better atmospheric physics and observations of luminosity changes during some LBV outbursts have cast doubt on the original models. The atmosphere of S Doradus has been modeled in detail between a normal minimum at magnitude 10.2 in 1985 and a maximum at magnitude 9.0 in 1989. The temperature was calculated to drop from 20,000 K to 9,000 K, and the luminosity dropped from to . This corresponds to an increase in the radius of the visible surface of the star from to . A simpler calculation of the variation from the deep 1965 minimum at magnitude 11.5 to the 1989 maximum gives a temperature drop from 35,000 K to 8,500 K, and the luminosity drop from to . For a brief period during the maximum in late 1999, the temperature dropped further to between 7,500 K and 8,500 K, without the brightness changing noticeably. This is normal in other LBVs at maximum and is as cool as they can get, but it has not been seen in S Doradus before, or since. Observations of AG Carinae have shown that any luminosity changes between minimum and maximum may occur abruptly over a small temperature range, with the luminosity approximately constant during the rest of the light curve.

The mass of an LBV is difficult to calculate directly unless it is in a binary system. The surface gravity changes dramatically and is difficult to measure from the peculiar spectral lines, and the radius is poorly defined. LBVs are thought to be the direct predecessors of Wolf–Rayet stars, but may be either just evolved from the main sequence or post-red supergiant stars with much lower masses. In the case of S Doradus, the current mass is likely to be in the range of .

<text>Michael Moriarty (born April 5, 1941) is an American-Canadian actor. He received an Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as a Nazi SS officer in the 1978 miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot; and a Tony Award in 1974 for his performance in the play &quot;Find Your Way Home&quot;. He played Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin Stone for the first four seasons (1990–1994) of the television show &quot;Law &amp; Order.&quot; Moriarty is also known for his roles in films such as &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, &quot;Q: The Winged Serpent&quot;, &quot;The Stuff&quot;, &quot;Pale Rider&quot;, &quot;Troll&quot;, &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;, and &quot;Shiloh&quot;.

==Early life==
Michael Moriarty was born in Detroit, Michigan, on April 5, 1941. He is the son of Eleanor (&quot;née&quot; Paul) and George Moriarty, a surgeon. His grandfather George Moriarty was a third baseman, umpire, and manager in major-league baseball for nearly 40 years.

Moriarty attended middle school at Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills before transferring to the University of Detroit Jesuit High School, graduating in 1959. He then matriculated at Dartmouth College, where he was a theatre major, in the class of 1963. After receiving his bachelor of arts degree, he left for London, England, where he enrolled in the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, having received a Fulbright Scholarship.

==Acting career==
Before gaining fame in films, Moriarty worked for several years as an actor at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. In 1973, Moriarty was cast as the egocentric baseball player Henry Wiggen in &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; opposite Robert De Niro as a slow-witted, terminally ill catcher. In the same year, Moriarty starred in a TV movie adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; with Katharine Hepburn. Coincidentally, the film also featured Sam Waterston, who later replaced Moriarty as the Executive Assistant District Attorney on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Moriarty&#x27;s role in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (as Jim, the Gentleman Caller; Waterston played the son Tom) won him an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He had a small part in &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, which was nominated for several Academy Awards. In 1974, Moriarty starred as rookie detective Bo Lockley in the acclaimed police drama &quot;Report to the Commissioner&quot;.

Moriarty won a Tony Award in 1974 for his performance in the play &quot;Find Your Way Home&quot;. His career on the screen was slow to develop, while his theatre career was flourishing. He played the lead character in &quot;Report to the Commissioner&quot; and had a significant role in &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;. He starred as the German SS officer Erik Dorf in the television miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot;, which earned him another Emmy. Through the 1980s, Moriarty starred in such Larry Cohen movies as &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;The Stuff&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Alive III: Island of the Alive&quot;, and &quot;A Return to Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; (much later, he appeared in &quot;Pale Rider&quot; and &quot;The Hanoi Hilton&quot;, as well as the &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; episode &quot;Pick Me Up&quot;, directed by Coen. In 1986, he starred in the fantasy science-fiction movie &quot;Troll&quot;, playing the role of Harry Potter, Sr. (unrelated to the Harry Potter series).

In 1989, Moriarty starred in the HBO production &quot;&quot;, which dramatized the Soviet Union&#x27;s shoot-down of Korean Air Lines flight 007 in 1983. He portrayed U.S. Air Force Major Hank Daniels, who was largely ignored (if not ridiculed) for showing how the ill-fated airliner had strayed off course into air space known by the Soviets to be used by U.S. Air Force electronic surveillance planes as they approached Soviet air space.

From 1990 to 1994, Moriarty starred as Executive Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. He left the show in 1994, alleging that his departure was a result of his threatening a lawsuit against then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who had cited &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; as offensively violent. Moriarty criticized Reno&#x27;s comment and claimed that she wanted to censor not only shows such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, but also such fare as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. He later accused &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; executive producer Dick Wolf of not taking his concerns seriously and claimed that Wolf and other network executives were &quot;caving in&quot; to Reno&#x27;s &quot;demands&quot; on the issue of TV violence. On September 20, 1994, on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, he made an offer to NBC, claiming that he would return to his role on the show if Wolf was fired. Moriarty published a full-page advertisement in a Hollywood trade magazine calling upon fellow artists to stand up with him against attempts to censor TV show content. He subsequently wrote and published &quot;The Gift of Stern Angels&quot;, his account of this time in his life. In the fictional &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; universe, Ben Stone resigns from the D.A.&#x27;s office in 1994 after a witness in one of his cases is murdered. The February 7, 2018, episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; shows Sam Waterston&#x27;s character, Jack McCoy, delivering a eulogy at Stone&#x27;s funeral.

Wolf and others working on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; contradict Moriarty&#x27;s account of how he left the series. On November 18, 1993, Moriarty and Wolf, along with other television executives, met with Reno to dissuade her from supporting any law that would censor the show. Wolf said that Moriarty overreacted to any effect the law was likely to have on the show. &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; producers claim they were forced to remove Moriarty from the series because of &quot;erratic behavior&quot;, an example of which reportedly happened during the filming of the episode &quot;Breeder&quot;, when, according to the episode&#x27;s director Arthur Forney, Moriarty began muttering to himself with a vacant look in his eyes, was unable to deliver his lines with a straight face, and had to be taken to a doctor. Series and network officials deny any connection between his departure and Janet Reno. Wolf also denies that the show has become less violent, graphic, or controversial since 1994.

Moriarty acted in &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;, &quot;Shiloh&quot;, &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;, and &quot;James Dean&quot;, for which he won his third Emmy. In 2007, he debuted his first feature-length film as screenwriter and performed the role of a man who thinks he is Adolf Hitler in &quot;Hitler Meets Christ&quot;.

==Other ventures==
In addition to his acting career, Moriarty is a semiprofessional jazz pianist and singer, as well as a classical composer. He has recorded three jazz albums (although the first, &quot;Reaching Out&quot;, went unreleased). He has regularly performed live in both New York City and Vancouver with a jazz trio and quintet. In a 1990 concert review, &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Stephen Holden called Moriarty &quot;a jazz pianist of considerable skill, an oddball singer with more than one vocal personality, and a writer of eccentric, jivey jazz songs.&quot;

Moriarty is politically active, describing himself as a &quot;centrist&quot; and sometimes as a &quot;realist&quot;. Moriarty announced his intention to run for the presidency in 2008 in an interview in the November 2005 issue of &quot;Northwest Jazz Profile&quot;, but he never formally declared his candidacy. He later endorsed fellow former &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; actor Fred Thompson for the presidency during the 2008 Republican primaries, as well as Carly Fiorina during the 2016 primary election cycle. He has been a frequent contributor of numerous political columns to the Enter Stage Right online &quot;Journal of Conservatism&quot;.

==Personal life==
Shortly after leaving &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Moriarty moved to Canada, declaring himself a political exile. He lived for a time in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he was granted Canadian citizenship, living in Toronto before settling in Vancouver.

In 2006, in the blog &quot;Enter Stage Right&quot; Moriarty wrote that he was a &quot;very bad drunk&quot;, but as of 2004, he had been sober for two years.

<text>CN Marine was a Canadian ferry company headquartered in Moncton, New Brunswick.

==History==
CN Marine was created by parent Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1977 as a means to group the company&#x27;s ferry operations in eastern Canada into a separate operating division. It had previously been part of the Canadian National Steamship Company. The majority of these ferries also required federal subsidies to supplement fares, thus CN was unwilling to have the operating losses appear in the railway&#x27;s accounts. CN Marine also operated the Newfoundland Dockyard in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

CN Marine undertook several major service improvements on the constitutionally mandated services to Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island by commissioning the construction of the new vessels &quot;Abegweit&quot; and &quot;Caribou&quot; in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1986, the federal government approved a restructuring at CN which saw the company remove itself completely from the east coast ferry service, which was renamed Marine Atlantic. This move was in advance of CN abandoning railway services on the islands of Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, which had required use of CN/CN Marine rail ferries. At the time of the changeover to Marine Atlantic, the last of the rail ferries to Newfoundland were retired, with that province&#x27;s railway abandoned in September 1988; Prince Edward Island followed in December 1989.

Marine Atlantic itself made many changes a decade later in 1997, virtually decimating the remnants of CN Marine by removing itself from all routes and vessels except the constitutionally mandated service to Port aux Basques and the seasonal service to Argentia, both originating in North Sydney. Also in 1997 Marine Atlantic sold off the Newfoundland Dockyard in St. John&#x27;s to a private operator. It was renamed NewDock-The St. John&#x27;s Dockyard Company.

<doc id="916726" wikidata="Q319841" url="?curid=916726" title="Luxor Temple">
<text>The Luxor Temple () is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the Egyptian language it was known as &quot;ipet resyt&quot;, &quot;the southern sanctuary&quot;. It was one of the two primary temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak. Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).

To the rear of the temple are chapels built by Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty, and Alexander. Other parts of the temple were built by Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. During the Roman era, the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress and the home of the Roman government in the area. During the Roman period a chapel inside the Luxor Temple originally dedicated to the goddess Mut was transformed into a Tetrarchy cult chapel and later into a church.

Along with the other archeological sites in Thebes, the Luxor Temple was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.

==Construction==

The Luxor Temple was built with sandstone from the Gebel el-Silsila area, which is located in South-Western Egypt. This sandstone is referred to as Nubian sandstone. It was used for the construction of monuments in Upper Egypt as well as in the course of past and current restoration works.

Like other Egyptian structures, a common technique used was symbolism, or illusionism. For example, to the Egyptian, a sanctuary shaped like an Anubis jackal was really Anubis. At the Luxor Temple, the two obelisks (the smaller one closer to the west is now at the Place de la Concorde in Paris) flanking the entrance were not the same height, but they created the illusion that they were. With the layout of the temple they appear to be of equal height, but using illusionism, it enhances the relative distances hence making them look the same size to the wall behind it. Symbolically, it is a visual and spatial effect to emphasize the heights and distance from the wall, enhancing the already existing pathway.

==Excavation==
From the Middle Ages, the population of Luxor had settled in and around the temple, at the southward end of the mount. Due to this, centuries of rubble had accumulated, to the point where there was an artificial hill some in height. The Luxor Temple had begun to be excavated by Professor Gaston Maspero after 1884, once he had been given permission to commence operations. The excavations were sporadic until 1960. Over time, accumulated rubbish of the ages had buried three quarters of the temple which contained the courts and colonnades which formed the nucleus of the Arab half of the modern village. Maspero had taken an interest earlier, and he had obtained the post of Mariette Pasha to complete the job in 1881. Not only was there rubbish, but there were also barracks, stores, houses, huts, pigeon towers, which needed to be removed in order to excavate the site. (There still exists a working mosque within the temple which was never removed.) Maspero received from the Egyptian minister of public works the authorization needed to obtain funds in order to negotiate compensation for the pieces of land covered by the houses and dependencies.

==Festivals==

The Luxor Temple was built during the New Kingdom and dedicated to the Theban Triad consisted of Amun, his consort Mut, and their son Khonsu. The focus of the annual Opet Festival, in which a cult statue of Amun was paraded down the Nile from nearby Karnak Temple (&quot;ipet-sut&quot;) to stay there for a while with his consort Mut, was to promote the fertility of Amun-Re and the Pharaoh. However, other studies at the temple by the Epigraphic Survey team present a completely new interpretation of Luxor and its great annual festival (the Feast of Opet). They have concluded that Luxor is the temple dedicated to the divine Egyptian ruler or, more precisely, to the cult of the Royal Ka. Examples of the cult of the Royal Ka can be seen with the colossal seated figures of the deified Ramesses II before the Pylon and at the entrance to the Grand colonnade are clearly Ka-statues, cult statues of the king as embodiment of the royal Ka.

==Avenue of Sphinxes and Shrine stations==
The avenue (known as &quot;wi.t ntr&quot; &quot;path of god&quot;; ) which went in a straight line for about between the Luxor Temple and the Karnak area was lined with human-headed sphinxes; in ancient times it is probable that these replaced earlier sphinxes which may have had different heads. Six barque shrines, serving as way stations for the barques of the gods during festival processions, were set up on the avenue between the Karnak and Luxor Temple. Along the avenue the stations were set up for ceremonies such as the Feast of Opet which held significance to the temple. Each station had a purpose, for example the fourth station was the station of Kamare, which cooled the oar of Amun. The Fifth station of Kamare was the station which received the beauty of Amun. Lastly the Sixth Station of Kamare was a shrine for Amun, Holy of Steps. 

A small mudbrick shrine was built in the courtyard of Nectanebo I in early second century (126 CE) and was dedicated to Serapis and Isis; it was presented to Roman Emperor Hadrian on his birthday.

==Abu Haggag Mosque==
The active Abu Haggag Mosque () is located within the temple, standing on the ancient columns themselves. That part of the Luxor Temple was converted to a church by the Romans in 395 AD, and then to a mosque around 640 AD, which is more than 4,000 years of continuous religious worship.

==Defacement==

In 2013, a Chinese student posted a picture of engraved writing that read &quot;Ding Jinhao was here&quot; () in Chinese on a sculpture. This discovery spurred debate about increased tourism after the media confirmed a Chinese student caused this and other defacements. The graffiti has since been partially cleared.

<text>Shelby Dade Foote Jr. (November 17, 1916 – June 27, 2005) was an American writer, historian and journalist. Although he primarily viewed himself as a novelist, he is now best known for his authorship of &quot;The Civil War: A Narrative&quot;, a three-volume history of the American Civil War.

With geographic and cultural roots in the Mississippi Delta, Foote&#x27;s life and writing paralleled the radical shift from the agrarian planter system of the Old South to the Civil Rights era of the New South. Foote was little known to the general public until his appearance in Ken Burns&#x27;s PBS documentary &quot;The Civil War&quot; in 1990, where he introduced a generation of Americans to a war that he believed was &quot;central to all our lives&quot;.
Foote did all his writing by hand with a nib pen, later transcribing the result into a typewritten copy. While Foote&#x27;s work was mostly well-received during his lifetime, it has been criticized by professional historians and academics in the 21st century.

==Early life==
Foote was born in Greenville, Mississippi, the son of Shelby Dade Foote and his wife Lillian (née Rosenstock). Foote&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Huger Lee Foote (1854–1915) was a planter who gambled away most of his assets. His paternal great-grandfather was Hezekiah William Foote (1813–99), an American Confederate veteran, attorney, planter and politician from Mississippi. His maternal grandfather was a Jewish immigrant from Vienna.

Foote was raised in his father&#x27;s Episcopal faith. He also attended synagogue each Saturday with his mother until the age of eleven.
Foote moved frequently as his father was promoted within the Armour and Company, living in Greenville, Jackson, and Vicksburg, Mississippi; Pensacola, Florida; and Mobile, Alabama. When Foote was five, his father died in Mobile, and his mother moved them back to Greenville. When Foote was 15 years old, he began lifelong friendships with Walker Percy and his brothers. Foote and Percy influenced each other greatly. Additional influences on Foote&#x27;s writing were Tacitus, Thucydides, Gibbon and Proust. 

At Greenville High School, Foote edited the student newspaper, &quot;The Pica,&quot; and frequently used it to lampoon the school&#x27;s principal. The principal got his revenge by recommending University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill not admit Foote in 1935. Foote was only able to get in by passing a round of admission tests.

In 1936, he was initiated in the Alpha Delta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Foote often skipped class to explore the library, even spending a night among the shelves. He began contributing pieces of fiction to &quot;Carolina Magazine,&quot; UNC&#x27;s award-winning literary journal. Foote returned to Greenville in 1937, where he worked in construction and for a local newspaper &quot;Delta Democrat Times.&quot; Foote&#x27;s Jewish heritage led to discrimination at Chapel Hill, an experience that bolstered his later support for the Civil Rights Movement.

In 1940, Foote joined the Mississippi National Guard and was commissioned as captain of artillery. His battalion was deployed to Northern Ireland in 1943. The following year, Foote was court-martialed and dismissed from the service. He was charged with falsifying a government document relating to the check-in of a vehicle he borrowed to visit his girlfriend in Belfast.

Foote got a job with the Associated Press in New York City. In January 1945, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps but was discharged as a private in November 1945 without seeing combat.

Foote returned to Greenville and took a job with a local radio station. He spent most of his time writing and submitted part of his first novel to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. When the &quot;Post&quot; published &quot;Flood Burial&quot; in 1946, Foote earned $750 and quit his job to write full-time.

==Novels==
Foote&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Tournament&quot; (1949), was inspired by his planter grandfather, who died two years before the author&#x27;s birth. For his next novel, &quot;Follow Me Down&quot; (1950), Foote drew on the proceedings of a Greenville murder trial he attended in 1941. &quot;Love in a Dry Season&quot; (1951) was his attempt to deal with the &quot;upper classes of the Mississippi Delta&quot; around the time of the Great Depression. Foote often expressed great affection for this novel. 

In &quot;Shiloh&quot; (1952), Foote developed his use of historical narrative to tell the story of the bloodiest battle in American history to that point. The narrative is presented by 17 characters: Confederate soldiers Metcalf, Dade, and Polly; and Union soldiers Fountain, Flickner, with each of the twelve named soldiers in the Indiana squad given one section of that chapter. The novel quickly sold 6,000 copies and was praised by critics. The book does showcase Foote&#x27;s Southern chauvinism, as the author &quot;favored the South throughout the novel, portraying the Confederate cause as a fight for constitutional liberty and omitting any reference to slavery&quot;.

&quot;Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative&quot; (1954) is a collection of novellas, short stories, and sketches from Foote&#x27;s mythical Mississippi county. 

&quot;September, September&quot; (1978) is the story of three white Southerners who kidnap the 8-year-old son of a wealthy African American, told against the backdrop of Memphis in September 1957. Foote struggled to write realistic African-American characters. Writing black characters for the novel &quot;scared the hell out of&quot; him, and he particularly struggled with the novel&#x27;s wealthy Theo Wiggins. Foote told Walker Percy the character was one of &quot;those bourgeois negroes, and I never really knew a single bourgeois nigger in my life.&quot;
Although he was not one of America&#x27;s best-known fiction writers, Foote was admired by peers like Eudora Welty and his literary hero William Faulkner. The latter once told a University of Virginia class that Foote &quot;shows promise, if he&#x27;ll just stop trying to write Faulkner, and will write some Shelby Foote.&quot; Foote&#x27;s fiction was recommended by both &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and critics from &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;.

==History==
Foote moved to Memphis in 1952. He worked on an epic called &quot;Two Gates to the City&quot; that he had begun outlining in 1951. He was struggling with the &quot;dark, horrible novel&quot; when Bennett Cerf of Random House asked Foote to write a short history of the Civil War. Cerf was impressed with the factual accuracy and rich detail of &quot;Shiloh&quot;, and he wanted to capitalize on the centenary of the war. Cerf offered him a contract for a work of approximately 200,000 words.

Foote worked for several weeks on an outline and decided that Cerf&#x27;s specifications were too small. He requested the project be expanded to three volumes of 5–600,000 words each. He estimated it would take nine years. It took twenty. The finished work ran to 3000 pages and was titled &quot;The Civil War: A Narrative&quot;. The individual volumes are &quot;Fort Sumter to Perryville&quot; (1958), &quot;Fredericksburg to Meridian&quot; (1963), and &quot;Red River to Appomattox&quot; (1974).

Foote had no training as a historian. He visited battlefields and read widely: standard biographies, campaign studies, and recent books by Hudson Strode, Bruce Catton, James G. Randall, Clifford Dowdey, T. Harry Williams, Kenneth M. Stampp and Allan Nevins. He also mined the primary sources in the 128-volume Official Records of the War of the Rebellion. He developed new respect for such disparate figures as Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, Patrick Cleburne, Edwin Stanton and Jefferson Davis. By contrast, he grew to dislike such figures as Phil Sheridan and Joe Johnston.

Foote described himself as a &quot;novelist-historian&quot; who employed &quot;the historian’s standards without his paraphernalia&quot; and &quot;employed the novelist’s methods without his license.&quot; To heighten the storytelling of his book, Foote eschewed footnotes. Citations would have &quot;totally shattered what I was doing. I didn&#x27;t want people glancing down at the bottom of the page every other sentence&quot;. Foote concluded most historians are &quot;so concerned with finding out what happened that they make the enormous mistake of equating facts with truth...you can&#x27;t get the truth from facts. The truth is the way you feel about it&quot;.

During the project, Foote lived off two Guggenheim Fellowships (1955–1960), Ford Foundation grants, and loans from Walker Percy.

===Reception===
Many reviews of &quot;The Civil War: A Narrative&quot; praised its style. Southern historian C. Vann Woodward argued Foote&#x27;s work was acceptable &quot;narrative history,&quot; which &quot;nonprofessionals have all but taken over.&quot;
Foote was criticized for his lack of interest in more current historical research, and for a less firm grasp of politics than of military affairs. John F. Marszalek praised Foote&#x27;s grasp of military history, &quot;Twenty years of dedicated labor have resulted in a literary masterpiece which places Shelby Foote among those very few historians who are authors of major syntheses...this history will long stand with the volumes of Bruce Catton as the final word on the military history of the Civil War.&quot;

In 1993, Richard N. Current argued that Foote too often depended on a single source for lifelike details, but &quot;probably is as accurate as most historians...Foote&#x27;s monumental narrative most likely will continue to be read and remembered as a classic of its kind.&quot; Academic historians routinely lament Foote&#x27;s lack of citations.

Eric Foner and Leon Litwack felt Foote underplayed the extent of Southern white racism, treating &quot;white southerners&quot; as synonymous with all &quot;southerners.&quot; Litwack concluded that &quot;Foote is an engaging battlefield guide, a master of the anecdote, and a gifted and charming story teller, but he is not a good historian.&quot; Foote&#x27;s biographer concluded, &quot;at its best, Foote&#x27;s writing dramatised tensions related to racial and regional identity. At its worst, it fell back on the social prescriptions of Southern paternalism.&quot;

====Lost Cause====
Many critics read Foote as sympathetic to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth. He relied extensively on the work of Hudson Strode, whose sympathy for Lost Cause claims resulted in a portrait of Jefferson Davis as a tragic hero without many of the flaws attributed to him by other historians.&quot; Annette Gordon-Reed suggested Foote&#x27;s work is powered by romantic nostalgia and bears &quot;the very strong mark of memory as opposed to history...the memories of that war which grew up with many white Southern males of his generation, are what power the narrative.&quot; 

Chandra Manning suggests Foote belongs to a school of Civil War historiography that &quot;answers &#x27;where does slavery fit in the Union cause&#x27; by saying &#x27;nowhere,&#x27; except maybe in the most reluctant and instrumental way&quot;. Joshua M. Zeitz described Foote as &quot;living proof that many Americans...remain under the spell of a century-old tendency to mystify the Confederacy&#x27;s martial glory at the expense of recalling the intense ideological purpose associated with its cause...we remain very much under the spell of Robert E. Lee, even as we decry slavery and its legacy&quot;. 

In a 1997 interview, Foote stated that he would have fought for the Confederacy, &quot;What&#x27;s more, I would fight for the Confederacy today if the circumstances were similar...States&#x27; rights is not just a theoretical excuse for oppressing people. You have to understand that the raggedy Confederate soldier who owned no slaves and probably couldn&#x27;t even read the Constitution, let alone understand it, when he was captured by Union soldiers and asked, &#x27;What are you fighting for?&#x27; replied, &#x27;I&#x27;m fighting because you&#x27;re down here.&#x27; So I certainly would have fought to keep people from invading my native state.&quot;

Foote saw slavery as a cause of the Civil War, commenting that &quot;the people who say slavery had nothing to do with the war are just as wrong as the people who say it had everything to do with the war.&quot; He argued slavery was &quot;doomed to extinction&quot; and was used as &quot;propaganda&quot;. He insisted, &quot;no soldier on either side gave a damn about the slaves—they were fighting for other reasons entirely in their minds.&quot;

====Praise of Nathan Bedford Forrest====
Foote kept Nathan Bedford Forrest&#x27;s portrait on his wall and lauded him as &quot;one of the most attractive men who ever walked through the pages of history&quot;. He dismissed Forrest&#x27;s role in the Fort Pillow Massacre. He suggested the general had tried to prevent the massacre, despite evidence to the contrary. Foote also compared Forrest to John Keats and Abraham Lincoln.

Foote argued, &quot;the French Maquis did far worse things than the Ku Klux Klan ever did—who never blew up trains or burnt bridges or anything else,&quot; and that the First Klan &quot;didn&#x27;t even have lynchings.&quot; In 1986, Foote strongly denounced the NAACP&#x27;s campaign to remove the Nathan Bedford Forrest Monument in Memphis, &quot;the day that black people admire Forrest as much as I do is the day when they will be free and equal, for they will have gotten prejudice out of their minds as we whites are trying to get it out of ours.&quot; 

Civil War historian Harold Holzer dismissed Foote&#x27;s characterization of Forrest as &quot;one of the great geniuses of the war&quot; along with Lincoln, &quot;Ken Burns always looks for varied voices and...characters, and Shelby Foote was certainly a character...Foote somehow compared the great emancipator with a man who owned slaves, murdered blacks and joined the Ku Klux Klan.&quot;

==Views==
Foote abhorred slavery, and believed emancipation was insufficient to address it: &quot;The institution of slavery is a stain on this nation&#x27;s soul that will never be cleansed. It is just as wrong as wrong can be, a huge sin... There&#x27;s a second sin that&#x27;s almost as great and that&#x27;s emancipation... There should have been a huge program for schools. There should have been all kinds of employment provided for them...there should have been some earnest effort to prepare these people for citizenship. They were not prepared, and operated under horrible disadvantages once the army was withdrawn, and some of the consequences are very much with us today.&quot; Foote condemned the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, which &quot;did, perhaps, some good work, but it was mostly a joke, corrupt in all kinds of ways.&quot; 

Foote supported the Civil Rights Movement in the South, arguing in 1968 that &quot;the main problem facing the white, upper-class South is to decide whether or not the negro is a man...if he is a man, as of course he is, then the negro is entitled to the respect an honorable man will automatically feel to an equal.&quot; 

Foote retained complex, patriarchal and sympathetic views of African Americans and race relations. He called his native Southern culture &quot;perhaps the most racist society in the United States.&quot; However, he believed his knowledge of the South meant he understood African-Americans like Nat Turner better than Northern African-American intellectuals did: &quot;I think that I am closer to Nat Turner than James Baldwin is... I consider somebody out of Harlem to be very different from someone out of Tidewater Virginia&quot;. Speaking in 1989, Foote stated that &quot;this black separatist movement is a bunch of junk&quot;, believing that African-Americans should model themselves on Jews, who Foote believed had a talent for making money. Foote, however, believed &quot;the odds against&quot; black people were to be &quot;too great&quot; for them to succeed in the US, as a result of &quot;having a different color skin&quot;.

While writing his history of the war in the 1950s and 1960s, Foote was a liberal on racial issues. He supported school integration, opposed Eisenhower&#x27;s hands-off approach to Southern racism, and championed Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. 

Foote protested against the KKK&#x27;s use of the Confederate flag, believing &#x27;that everything they stood for was almost exactly the opposite of everything the Confederacy had stood for&#x27;. Nonetheless, Foote felt the flag should still be flown because it &quot;represents many noble things.&quot;

==Later life==
After finishing &quot;September, September&quot;, Foote resumed work on &quot;Two Gates to the City&quot;, the novel he had set aside in 1954 to write the Civil War trilogy. The work still gave him trouble and he set it aside once more, in the summer of 1978, to write &quot;Echoes of Shiloh,&quot; an article for &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;. By 1981, he had given up on &quot;Two Gates&quot; altogether, though he told interviewers for years afterward that he continued to work on it. He served on the Naval Academy Advisory Board in the 1980s.

In the late 1980s, Ken Burns had assembled a group of consultants to interview for his Civil War documentary. Foote was not in this initial group, though Burns had Foote&#x27;s trilogy on his reading list. A phone call from Robert Penn Warren prompted Burns to contact Foote. Burns and crew traveled to Memphis in 1986 to film an interview with Foote in the anteroom of his study. In November 1986, Foote figured prominently at a meeting of dozens of consultants gathered to critique Burns&#x27; script. Burns interviewed Foote on-camera in Memphis and Vicksburg in 1987. That same year, he became a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The Civil War historian Judkin Browning has noted that Foote&#x27;s outspoken praise of Nathan Bedford Forrest in the documentary ensured &quot;Lost Causers raised their beer mugs in salute while historians hurled their lagers at their televisions.&quot; Foote has been further criticized for repeating &quot;plainly wrong&quot; Lost Cause tropes in his commentary, particularly over the issue of apparently &quot;overwhelming&quot; Northern industrial advantage and his downplaying of the role of slavery in causing the Civil War.

The extent of Foote&#x27;s apparent apologia for white Southern racism and Lost Cause mythologizing was satirized in the character of Sherman Hoyle in the 2004 mockumentary &quot;C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America&quot;, a character defined by his &quot;consistent lamenting of and apologies for the good ole days.&quot;

Foote professed to be a reluctant celebrity. When &quot;The Civil War&quot; was first broadcast, his telephone number was publicly listed and he received many phone calls from people who had seen him on television. Foote never unlisted his number, and the volume of calls increased each time the series re-aired. Many Memphis natives were known to pay Foote a visit at his East Parkway residence in Midtown Memphis.

Horton Foote, the playwright and screenwriter (&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall&quot; and &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;) was the voice of Jefferson Davis in the PBS series. The two Footes are third cousins; their great-grandfathers were brothers. &quot;And while we didn&#x27;t grow up together, we have become friends; I was the voice of Jefferson Davis in that TV series&quot;, Horton Foote added proudly.

In 1992, Foote received an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina. In the early 1990s, Foote was interviewed by journalist Tony Horwitz for the project on American memory of the Civil War which Horwitz eventually published as &quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot; (1998). Foote was also a member of The Modern Library&#x27;s editorial board for the re-launch of the series in the mid-1990s, this series published two books excerpted from his Civil War narrative. Foote also contributed a long introduction to their edition of Stephen Crane&#x27;s &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, giving a narrative biography of the author. He also received the 1992 St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates.

Foote was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1994. Also in 1994, Foote joined Protect Historic America and was instrumental in opposing a Disney theme park near battlefield sites in Virginia. Along the way, Burns asked him to return for his upcoming documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;, where he appeared in both the 2nd Inning discussing his recollections of the dynamics of the crowds in his youth and in the 5th Inning (TV series), where he gave an account of his meeting Babe Ruth.

In 1998, the author Tony Horwitz visited Foote for his book &quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot;, a meeting in which Foote declared he was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the &quot;behavior of blacks, who are fulfilling every dire prophesy the Ku Klux Klan made&quot;, and that African Americans were &quot;acting as if the utter lie about blacks being somewhere between ape and man were true&quot;. Foote emphasized that his loyalties during the 1860s would have been to Southerners: &quot;I’d be with my people, right or wrong.&quot; Foote also argued that freedmen had led to the failure of Reconstruction and that the Confederate flag represented &quot;law, honour, love of country.&quot; Foote stated that he would have been willing to fight for the Confederacy: &quot;If I was against slavery, I&#x27;d still be with the South. I&#x27;m a man, my society needs me, here I am.&quot;

In 1999, Foote received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from The College of William &amp; Mary.

On September 2, 2001, he was the focus of the C-SPAN television program &quot;In-Depth&quot;. In a three-hour interview, conducted by C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb, Foote shows off the library of his home, working room, and writing desk, and details the writing of his books as well as taking on-air calls and emails.

Foote campaigned in the 2001 referendum on the Flag of Mississippi, arguing against a proposal which would have replaced the Confederate battle flag with a blue canton with 20 stars. Foote rejected the Confederate flag&#x27;s association with white supremacy and argued &quot;I’m for the Confederate flag always and forever. Many among the finest people this country has ever produced died in that war. To take it and call it a symbol of evil is a misrepresentation.&quot;

In 2003, Foote received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The Helmerich Award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust.

Foote died at Baptist Hospital in Memphis on June 27, 2005, aged 88. He had had a heart attack after a recent pulmonary embolism. He was interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. His grave is beside the family plot of General Forrest.

==Legacy==
In a 2011 commentary, Ta-Nehisi Coates concluded that &quot;The Civil War&quot; was not a &quot;neo-Confederate apologia&quot;, but he lamented Foote&#x27;s lack of a Black perspective: &quot;Shelby Foote wrote &quot;The Civil War&quot;, but he never understood it. Understanding the Civil War was a luxury his whiteness could ill-afford.&quot;

In 2013, the Sons of Confederate Veterans protested the removal of Nathan Bedford Forrest&#x27;s statue in Memphis by invoking Foote&#x27;s characterization of him as a &quot;humane slave holder&quot;.
In 2017, the conservative writer Bill Kauffman, writing in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, argued for a revival of Foote&#x27;s sympathetic portrayal of the South. In October 2017, John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff for President Donald Trump, argued that &quot;the lack of ability to compromise led to the Civil War&quot; and praised Robert E. Lee as an &quot;honorable man&quot;. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Kelly&#x27;s controversial remarks by citing Foote&#x27;s work.

On October 18, 2019, a Mississippi Writers Trail historical marker was installed in Greenville, Mississippi, to honor the literary and historical contributions of Shelby Foote.

Foote&#x27;s distinctive Southern accent was the model for Daniel Craig&#x27;s character in the 2019 film &quot;Knives Out&quot;.

<doc id="916756" wikidata="Q485867" url="?curid=916756" title="South Korea at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>South Korea competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourteenth appearance at the Olympics, attending every Summer Olympics held during the country&#x27;s existence up to that point with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of its support for the United States-led boycott. The Korean Olympic Committee sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since 1992. A total of 264 athletes, 145 men and 119 women, competed in 25 sports.

South Korea left Athens with a total of 30 medals (9 golds, 12 silver, and 9 bronze), finishing ninth in the overall medal standings. Four of these medals were awarded to the athletes in archery, badminton, and taekwondo (South Korea&#x27;s traditional martial art), and three each in judo, shooting, and table tennis. South Korea&#x27;s team-based athletes proved successful in Athens as the women&#x27;s handball team climbed the podium with a silver medal for the second time, following its major setback in Sydney from a fourth-place finish.

Among the nation&#x27;s medalists were taekwondo jin Moon Dae-sung in the men&#x27;s super heavyweight division, archer Park Sung-hyun in both women&#x27;s individual and team event, artistic gymnasts Kim Dae-eun and Yang Tae-young in the men&#x27;s individual all-around, and trap shooter Lee Bo-Na.

Both North Korea and South Korea marched together in the parade of nations during the opening and closing ceremonies under the Unification Flag, a white flag showing the united Korean Peninsula in blue. They had two flagbearers carrying the flag together at each occasion, one representing the North and the other representing the South. The female athletes and staff wore red blazers, while their male counterparts wore blue. Although they marched together, the teams competed separately and had separate medal tallies.

<doc id="916775" wikidata="Q1681189" url="?curid=916775" title="Let's Go with Pancho Villa">
<text>Let&#x27;s Go with Pancho Villa (Spanish: Vámonos con Pancho Villa) is a Mexican motion picture directed by Fernando de Fuentes in 1936, the last of the director&#x27;s &quot;Revolution Trilogy&quot;, besides &quot;El prisionero trece&quot; and &quot;El compadre Mendoza&quot;.

Like the previous films in the trilogy, the film is critical towards propagandist views of the Mexican Revolution by portraying the conflicts as a tragic series of events within Mexican history, emphasized by the characterization of its titular character, general Pancho Villa, being depicted as a cruel leader instead of a national hero.

The movie is thought to have been the first Mexican super-production and led to the bankruptcy of the film company that made it.

==Plot==
Villa was portrayed by Domingo Soler. Directed by Fernando de Fuentes, the film tells the story of a group of six friends, or &quot;rancheros&quot;, who hear about the revolution and Villa and decide to join him, only to suffer the cruel reality of war under the command of an apathetic Villa who, despite the observed horror of war, simply does not care about his men.

The movie has two endings: the original ending shows the last surviving friend returning to his home, disenchanted with both Villa and the Revolution.

The second ending, discovered many years later, returns to the same scene ten years later, when an old and weakened Villa tries to recruit the last survivor again; when the father hesitates as he does not want to leave his wife and daughter behind, Villa kills the wife and daughter. The angry father then tries to kill Villa, before another man shoots the father dead. Villa takes the sole survivor, the son, with him.

== Reception ==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Go with Pancho Villa&quot; has a 62% rating on Popcornmeter (the audience score) on Rotten Tomatoes. 

The Los Angeles Times Daily Mirror described the movie as &quot;a bleak film of increasingly senseless violence&quot;. In a mostly negative review, the author (writing anonymously as they have since left the LA Times) criticizes the lack of character definition in the movie, describes camera movements as &quot;so rough it could be a documentary&quot; and the score to be almost imperceptible several times throughout the movie. 

Writing for Slant Magazine, in a more positive review, Aaron Cutler describes the movie&#x27;s production as &quot;quick, fluid movement, lots of music, smooth unassuming transitions, clean sound, rapid action, and extended colloquial humor&quot;. However, he criticizes the dialogue as being typically Hollywood, with dramatic and unrealistic lines that lead the audience to be enamored by the emotion behind the dialogue, rather than the fact. 

In honor of the 100th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution, the 2010 New York Film Festival showcased &quot;Let&#x27;s Go with Pancho Villa&quot; as one part of a de Fuentes&#x27; movie trilogy depicting the Revolution. 

==Background==
Though it was a sizable financial failure when released, interest and professional appreciation of the film experienced a resurgence in the late sixties. Today, it is considered one of the best movies of Mexican cinema, both for its approach to the theme and its technical merits. In 1994, a list of the 100 best films of Mexican cinema was published by &quot;Somos&quot; magazine: &quot;Let&#x27;s Go with Pancho Villa&quot; was the number one film on the list.

It stands apart among the many movies made about Villa in that it portrays the man and the Revolution in its cruelty; most other films, like those by Ismael Rodríguez in the 1960s, take an almost idyllic view of both, following the official (government) mythos. &quot;Let&#x27;s Go with Pancho Villa&quot; was revered for its derisive interpretation of the Mexican government and thematic emphasis on the benefit of peace to the individual citizen.

The movie&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Silvestre Revueltas, who makes a cameo appearance. The score was another appeal to critics during the sixties&#x27; revival of the film.

The Mexican government contributed the military equipment and soldiers.

<text>The House of Stenkil was a dynasty that ruled the Kingdom of Sweden from c. 1060 to c. 1125. King Stenkil, the dynasty&#x27;s founder, probably originated from Västergötland.

Line (of magnates and earls) before Stenkil, according to the Norse sagas:
*Skagul Toste (took Danegeld in England and was the father of Sigrid the Haughty)
*Ulf Tostesson, the son of Skagul Toste
*Ragnvald Ulfsson, the son of Ulf Tostesson, and exiled to Staraja Ladoga by Olof Skötkonung

On the throne of Sweden or Västergötland:
*1060–1066 : Stenkil
*1067–1070 : Halsten Stenkilsson (&quot;Halsten&quot;), son of Stenkil
*1079–1084 : Inge the Elder (&quot;Inge den äldre&quot;), son of Stenkil
*1084–1087 : Blot-Sweyn (&quot;Blot-Sven&quot;), possibly brother-in-law of Inge I the Elder
*1087–1110 : Inge the Elder (&quot;Inge den äldre&quot;), 2nd time, restored
*1110–1118 : Philip (&quot;Filip Halstensson&quot;), no children
*1110–1125 : Inge the Younger (&quot;Inge den yngre&quot;), no children

&quot;Cognatic offshoots&quot;:
* c. 1125 – c 1130 Magnus I of Gothenland (the regnal list published by the royal court of Sweden includes him as a member of Stenkil dynasty), was son of Inge the Elder&#x27;s daughter
* c. 1150 – 1160 Eric IX of Sweden who was married with Christina, according to Norse legends daughter&#x27;s daughter of Inge the Elder; this couple started the dynasty of Eric
(* c. 1155 – 1167 Charles VII of Sweden (his mother was the widow of Inge the Younger) who married Kirsten Stigsdatter, according to Norse legends daughter&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s daughter of Inge the Elder; Charles belonged to the c 1130 ascended dynasty of Sverker)
* 1160–61 Magnus (II) of Sweden (the regnal list published by the royal court of Sweden includes him as a member of Stenkil dynasty; some tend to call him as the &quot;last&quot; monarch of the House of Stenkil which however is a genealogically debatable concept), was the son of a daughter of Inge the Elder&#x27;s son Ragvald.

<text>St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society, colloquially known as Cuth&#x27;s, is a college of Durham University. It was founded in 1888 for students who were not attached to the existing colleges. St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society is a Bailey college, based on Durham&#x27;s peninsula next to the River Wear, although it also has other accommodation a few minutes&#x27; walk away in Old Elvet.

St Cuthbert&#x27;s retains its title of &#x27;society&#x27;, although its workings have changed since its formation. Its foundation differed from that of Durham&#x27;s other colleges in that it was established as a common room for, and by, its students. Other Societies followed: St Aidan&#x27;s Society – now St Aidan&#x27;s College, and the Graduate Society – now Ustinov College. It is still home to the highest proportion of local students (very few of whom live in) and traditionally houses a high proportion of mature students.
It is the only collegiate body to offer undergraduates catered, self-catered, and part catered accommodation.

==History==
===Origins===
To arrest declining numbers of entrants, Durham University began to allow the admission of &#x27;unattached&#x27; students from Michaelmas term of 1871. Unlike other undergraduates, the unattached lived in licensed lodgings as opposed to a college or hall. While still expected to follow the normal regulations of the university (such as attending morning prayer at Durham Cathedral and wearing academic gowns in public), the manner of their living enabled a privacy that was &quot;often the envy&quot; of fellow students.

Required to be at least 23 years old, the unattached were often married men who took little part in the social or sporting side of university education. Initially under the supervision of a junior proctor, who appointed a Senior Man from one of their number, they did not have anything that could be called an organisation, with no clubs of their own and no common room to provide a permanent meeting place.

===1888-1918: Growth and consolidation===

After two previous attempts earlier in the decade, the unattached students finally consolidated themselves in October 1888. A successful meeting saw the election of a committee made up of a president, honorary secretary, and seven other members, with an agreement to hold regular meetings and create a program of events for the unattached, including a debate to be held every other week. One staff member in attendance, Hastings Rashdall, then chaplain of University College, was particularly enthusiastic. He felt the unattached spent too much time reading books, and too little time taking in the social life of the wider university. A few weeks after the meeting, the association took the name of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society, referencing the saint of the same name.

The society gained a common room in 1893 when the university granted it space in Cosin&#x27;s Hall, and this was to effectively be its &#x27;home&#x27; for the next fifty years. Essentially a private student club, the society had no official existence as far as the university was concerned. On the other hand, it was developing a distinct collegiate identity through participation in sport, and it was to St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society (not to the unattached) that the university gave the use of facilities like the common room and boat house. As the decade progressed, St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society was being spoken of as if it actually were a college. Meanwhile, regulations were changed so that from Michaelmas 1894 prospective members no longer needed to be elected. Instead, all unattached students in residence were regarded as &quot;ipso facto members&quot; of the society.

With the death of Queen Victoria and the onset of the Edwardian era, there was a gradual shift in the political positions taken by Cuthbert&#x27;s men. Whereas before they had tended to exemplify traditional values, like support for the Empire and a belief that &quot;the working classes should be kept firmly in their place&quot;, reformist opinion now occasionally surfaced. In time the &quot;prevailing mood&quot; reflected that of the country at large — &quot;Cuthbert&#x27;s men were, on the whole, Liberals&quot;.
In December 1910 the university decided that unattached students resident in Durham should henceforth be called &quot;non-collegiate&quot; students, in order to distinguish them from other unattached students taking qualifications on an external basis. This meant the non-collegiate body effectively became identical in membership to St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society. The outbreak of the Great War made little impact at first, with the society resolving not to mention the ongoing conflict during formal meetings. This &quot;tacit agreement to ignore the war&quot; was discarded in January 1916 when the Military Service Act was passed, which conscripted all unmarried men between 18 and 41. By March the &quot;Durham University Journal&quot; was able to list 13 society members now in active service, two of whom would later be killed in action. Compared to other academic institutions, St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society suffered relatively few deaths during the war, as many of its members had been regimental chaplains. Consequently, the &quot;dreadful casualties&quot; experienced by nearby Bede College were avoided.

The society grew in size until the Second World War, when numbers of students in the university dropped sharply and the society was effectively in abeyance until &#x27;refounded&#x27; in 1945 by veterans returning from combat who wished to complete their degrees. When the society moved to the South Bailey in 1951, it began to offer accommodation to a small number of students and created the position of principal to replace that of censor. The first principal, Clifford Leech, a distinguished academic and widely acknowledged expert on Jacobean literature, served for several years in this role before going on to become professor of English at the University of Toronto. His portrait, by Thomas William Pattison (1894–1983), hangs in the college hall. The principal is now responsible for managing all aspects of the society. The society includes a dedicated team of university staff, a junior common room, a senior room, an alumni association and a group of fellows.

Over the years the society has expanded a great deal and now has a large body of accommodation on the Bailey as well as elsewhere in Durham. In 1969 it became the first establishment in Durham to become mixed sex, admitting 8 female students (also before any Oxbridge college became mixed sex). In 2006 &#x27;Brooks House&#x27; was built and this allowed all first-year undergraduates to live in for the first time, as well as a number of returners and postgraduate students.

==Traditions==
The patron of the society, St. Cuthbert, continues to be remembered annually, if somewhat incongruously for an ascetic, in The Feast, a traditional banquet held on or near St. Cuthbert&#x27;s feast day of 20 March each year.

Another annual event is Cuth&#x27;s Day, a day of entertainment conducted on, off and in the River Wear, which curls around the foot of the bailey where the society is based.

The surviving ‘Refounders’ of the society hold a reunion weekend every September in college. The same weekend also hosts the Annual General Meeting of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Association, the alumni organisation of the society. In addition to this, the founders of the society are remembered at the annual Founders&#x27; Formal and past Presidents attend the Presidents&#x27; Formal.

St Cuthbert&#x27;s also has a strong historical rivalry with nearby Hatfield College, which manifests itself in sports and other activities as well as singing songs (of varying degrees of offensiveness). There is a story that, in the 1960s, a group of Cuth&#x27;s students stole a lion statue from Hatfield and painted it to look like a tiger, to avoid arousing suspicion.

===Coat of arms===
The original seventh-century pectoral cross of St. Cuthbert was discovered when his grave was opened in 1827, and is now preserved in the cathedral treasury. The motto, &quot;gratia gratiam parit&quot;, appears in the Adagia of Erasmus, a collection of Greek and Latin adages, and can be loosely translated as ‘friendship begets friendship’ or ‘kindness begets kindness’. The full coat of arms includes an eider duck as the crest. This is because, while resident in the Farne Islands, St Cuthbert instituted special laws to protect these and other seabirds nesting there, creating what may have been the first bird protection laws anywhere in the world. Consequently, eider ducks have long been known as &#x27;cuddy ducks&#x27; (Cuthbert&#x27;s ducks) in the Pitmatic dialect as spoken in Northumberland.

==Buildings and Accommodation==
=== Bailey ===
The headquarters of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society is situated at the end of the Bailey, an ancient street with other Colleges, and it is therefore a Bailey College. The Bailey consists of five historic buildings, lots of which have shared room accommodation. These consists of House 12 (headquarters), House 8 (the largest), House 13 and Wendy House (which share a large garden), and Houses 26 and 27 on North Bailey.

Of the many characteristics include the rivalry with nearby Hatfield College, and nextdoor (House 8) St John&#x27;s College and close proximity to the Cathedral, allowing the sound of their bells to be heard by all living in College here.

==== House 12 ====
House 12 contains the headquarters to the society, the Bailey Bar, the JCR, the dining room - seating 150 hosting many dinners and formals, and a garden. It also contains a small amount of accommodation reserved for undergraduates, and houses some returning students such as the bar steward - as they are therefore living above the bar. The building dates from the 17th century and is Grade II* listed.

==== House 8 ====
House 8 consists of most of the accommodation of undergraduates on the Bailey. It also supports a library - with a computer room and conference room, for all members of the society, a gym, a study room, and two large gardens (adjoining with the River) with a Grade I listed wall. The building was constructed in the late 18th century and is Grade II listed.

The JCR president has the right to occupy a flat inside House 8 every year, as it is a sabbatical role. This flat is inside the House and is directly above an internal entry to the society&#x27;s library.

==== House 13 and Wendy House ====
House 13 makes some of the remaining (undergraduate) accommodation on the Bailey. It contains no shared amenities with those not living in College, and is an early 18th century Grade II listed building. Wendy House is in the garden of House 13 and contains accommodation for, in most cases, five undergraduate students. The garden overlooks the society&#x27;s headquarters, is adjacent to one of the cathedral&#x27;s gardens, and adjoins The Chorister School.

==== Houses 26 and 27 ====
Houses 26 and 27 contain the remaining accommodation, and are on North Bailey. They are purely residential and, also, contain no shared amenities. These buildings hail from mid 18th century and enjoy a favourable location further up the Bailey, whilst being very close to the headquarters still.

=== Parsons Field ===
The majority of the society&#x27;s accommodation is at Parsons Field, in Old Elvet. The site consists of four buildings, with one (Brooks House) including en-suite facilities, and the others (Refounders House, Parsons Field Court and Fonteyn Court) consisting of standard single rooms. Returning students typically live in Brooks House, with other buildings at Parsons Field being primarily for first year undergraduates.

By having catered, part catered and self-catered accommodation, St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society offers a choice of meal packages to students. Parsons Field has another bar, another gym, another computer room, and a music room.

==Student life==

The society has over 40 sports and societies, including a rugby team, a hockey team, a boat club, a running club, a drama society, an art society, a big band and a choir.

===Boat Club===

Launched in the summer of 1893, five years after the foundation of the society itself, the St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society Boat Club offers training and facilities for rowers of all levels and commitment. It is one of the oldest student societies in the university and is based from the St Cuthbert&#x27;s Boat House in the Elvet area of the city. 

SCSBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code &quot;SCB&quot; and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing. 
===Running Club===
Founded in 2016, the running club is currently one of the most successful sports teams in the college. The club also offers personalised coaching plans and very popular socials that regularly attract upwards of 50 members.

<text>Robert and Elizabeth is a musical with music by Ron Grainer and book and lyrics by Ronald Millar. The story is based on an unproduced musical titled &quot;The Third Kiss&quot; by Judge Fred G. Moritt, which in turn was adapted from the play &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; by Rudolph Besier. It is an operetta-style musical which tells the story of the romance and elopement of poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett. The original 1964 London production was a success, starring John Clements as Barrett, June Bronhill as Elizabeth and Keith Michell as Robert. Several revivals have followed.

==Productions==
The original West End production opened at the Lyric Theatre in London on 20 October 1964 and ran for 948 performances. The cast was as follows:
* John Clements – Edward Moulton-Barrett
* June Bronhill – Elizabeth Barrett
* Keith Michell – Robert Browning
* Angela Richards – Henrietta

The original Australian production, in which June Bronhill reprised her London role, opened at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne on 21 May 1966. The cast also starred English actor Denis Quilley as Robert, Frank Thring as Edward, and included Madeleine Orr in a smaller role. The show ran for six months in Melbourne before moving to Sydney, where it ran for four weeks.

The musical was produced at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford, England, starring Jeremy Brett and Sally Ann Howes from 22 December 1976 to 29 January 1977. Another production ran at the Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, from November through December 1982, with Marc Jacoby as Robert and Leigh Beery as Elizabeth.

It was staged in the 1987 Chichester Festival, featuring Mark Wynter. A recording of the production was released by First Night Records (ASIN: B000024TK6). The musical then played at the Forum Theater in Chicago, Illinois in November 1974, with Steven Arlen as Robert.

The show was prevented from being produced on Broadway due to a copyright disagreement with the estate of Rudolph Besier, author of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, on which the story was partly based.

<doc id="916794" wikidata="Q17085410" url="?curid=916794" title="Table dance">
<text>A table dance, or bartop dance, is a dance performed at (or on) a table or bar, as opposed to on a stage. It may be an erotic dance performed by a sex worker or it may be done as a leisure activity.

==Sex work==
In strip clubs, a table dance is a semi-private sexual performance that takes place near or on a customer&#x27;s table. In some jurisdictions, a table dance may be an alternative to a lap dance, due to laws preventing exotic dancers from making contact with customers. For example, in Waterloo, Ontario, a table dance is performed on a small portable platform the dancer takes around to patrons’ tables. The Windmill Theatre in Soho, London operated as a strip club from the 1990s until 2018. The club&#x27;s licensing conditions included a &quot;no touching&quot; rule and the club had a licence for striptease, pole-dancing and table dancing. In many clubs, dancers earn most of their money from tips for table dancing.

==Establishments==

The &quot;bartop dance&quot;, performed for the entertainment of those seated at the bar, is similar to the table dance. The film &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, set in the New York City bar of the same name, led to a fashion for bartop dancing establishments. Several bars around the city (e.g. Coyote Ugly, Hogs and Heifers, Red Rock West Saloon, Doc Holliday&#x27;s Saloon) actively encouraged women to jump on the bar and dance, contributing to an &quot;Anything Goes&quot; atmosphere. Hogs and Heifers encourages dancers to leave their brassiere hanging from the ceiling to commemorate their dance. However, table dancing is forbidden at many events and establishments.

Table dancing by patrons (both male and female) became more common in New York after the enforcement of the City&#x27;s cabaret licenses (required for dancing establishments) was relaxed around the time of the 2001 election of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In 2002, the Hilton sisters Paris and Nicky were reputed to be constant table dancers at club Bungalow 8. Nicky denied the allegations and claimed that they only dance on the s, and added that she did it purely &quot;because it was fun&quot;. At another restaurant named Da Silvano, it was reported that Kim Cattrall, Candace Bushnell and Patricia Duff were seen table dancing together. Duff said &quot;Somebody placed me up on the table, so I danced,&quot; and that the night was &quot;spontaneous and magical&quot;.

==Carnivals and festivals==
Another form of table dance is practiced at traditional events like in Brazilian, European and Australian Carnivals, in German beer tents during Oktoberfest, and at other similar events. However, this kind of table dance is not of an erotic nature. As this dance often leads to accidents, especially if performed by intoxicated individuals, it is often forbidden at many events, but dancing on chairs or benches may still be allowed.

<doc id="916798" wikidata="Q4771155" url="?curid=916798" title="Antelope Acres, California">
<text>Antelope Acres is an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County, California. It lies at an elevation of 2425 feet (739 m).

Antelope Acres is located in the Antelope Valley, a high desert valley split between northern Los Angeles County and southeast Kern County, approximately from downtown Lancaster and from downtown Los Angeles. The community has a population of about 2,800. It is a rural community centered south of California State Highway 138 (Avenue D) near 90th Street West.

The community has become the home to many commuters who work in nearby cities; however, it still maintains a significant agricultural presence with livestock, field crops, and a local chapter of the 4H club. It also offers an open landscape for outdoor enthusiasts.

==Services==

<text>Candice Jean Earley (August 18, 1950 – January 31, 2019) was an American actress and singer born in Oklahoma.

== Early years ==
Earley was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, to Harold and Jean (née Daily) Earley. She won the Miss Lawton title. She had 14 years of training as a classical singer and attended Trinity University, where she studied drama.

== Career ==
Earley had Broadway roles in &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. She also portrayed Sheila with a touring company of &quot;Hair&quot; and sang in the chorus of a touring company of &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot;. A lyric soprano, Earley also performed in cabarets.
She was starred as Sandy Dumbrowski in Grease in 1974. 

Earley is most famous for her role as Donna Beck Tyler Cortlandt Sago Tyler on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role she played from February 19th 1976 to 1992. Donna was originally a troubled youth from an abusive home, who was a runaway and a prostitute. In her first appearance on &quot;All My Children&quot;, Donna is found in a hospital bed and in a coma after being kidnapped, beaten and raped by her pimp, Tyrone. However, the actress playing the part of Donna was not Candice Earley, but a different actress originally hired to play the part. The producers were unsatisfied with the acting ability of this actress, and Earley was hired to play the part, which was slated to be a short-term role.

Earley&#x27;s portrayal proved popular with viewers, and won an award for Most Exciting New Actress in the first annual Soapies held in 1977 (these awards are now known as the Soap Opera Digest Awards). Over time, the character of Donna grew into a mature woman with a gift for singing who opened and ran a successful hair salon. Earley was written out of the show in 1992 after she got married.

==Death==
Earley died on January 31, 2019, after an eight-year battle with multiple system atrophy (MSA).

<doc id="916815" wikidata="Q6986887" url="?curid=916815" title="Neenach, California">
<text>Neenach ( ) is an agricultural settlement in northwestern Los Angeles County, California, United States, with a population of about 800. It is facing a massive change with the proposed construction of a 23,000-home planned community to its north called Centennial.
== Geography and climate ==
Neenach is northwest of Lancaster in the Antelope Valley portion of Southern California. It is southeast of Gorman and north of the Sierra Pelona Mountains, and from the county seat in Downtown Los Angeles. This region experiences hot and dry summers.

== History ==

=== Early names ===
The original name for present day Neenach is &quot;puyutsiwamǝŋ&quot;. This is in the Kitanemuk language. The Spanish referred to it as &quot;Ojo de la Vaca&quot;.

===Cow Springs and French John&#x27;s Station===
A 19th century name for the area was Cow Springs (), about a mile southwest of today&#x27;s Neenach School. El Camino Viejo, the Old Road to Los Angeles, passed from Laguna Chico Lopez north via Willow Springs Canyon, then west to the water at Aquaje Lodoso, then to Cow Springs and on to Tejon Pass. Later a shorter route was followed by the Stockton - Los Angeles Road and the Butterfield Overland Mail between Elizabeth Lake and Gorman. Instead of going north-south, travelers went east-west via the San Andreas Rift and Oakgrove Canyon, and north-south via Pine Canyon, Antelope Valley and Cow Springs. French Johns Station, east of Gorman near Cow Springs, provided a way station for the stage line, teamsters and other travelers.

In 1888, Cow Springs was described as &quot;a pleasant camping-place with willow trees, casting an inviting shade to the weary traveler&quot; with a &quot;pure, cold, limpid stream which came bubbling up from its earthen reservoir and went gaily dancing down to the thirsty soil that encompassed it about&quot;.

=== Establishment ===
Neenach itself was founded in the 1870s by Danish settlers from Neenah, Wisconsin. In 1888, a post office was established, with John A. Coovert as the first postmaster. In September 1905 Christian Clausen was named postmaster.

James Anderson filed a homestead claim for 160 acres (647,000 m²) at present-day State Route 138 and 300th Street West in 1887. He had a county contract to maintain and improve roads in the Antelope Valley as far as Three Points.

Construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between 1905 and 1913, which brought water from the distant Owens Valley to the San Fernando Valley, was important to the area.

On July 13, 1917, Chief Water Engineer William Mulholland of the city of Los Angeles, the builder of the aqueduct, received word that the line had been broken. He went to Neenach and found a . He ordered additional surveillance, which saw the arrest of one man, an employee of the rival Los Angeles Gas and Electric Company. The suspect was later released.

James Anderson became a line rider or patrolman on the aqueduct: He had to shut down the tunnel periodically to check its condition. He also checked the surface to verify that none of the aqueduct&#x27;s opponents had damaged it. Harry Womersley, from England by way of Illinois, was another resident who worked on the aqueduct—the from Fairmont to Neenach.

Gold was discovered in the hills south of the community in the early 1930s. The &quot;Oh Suzanna&quot; mine produced some $7 million over the few years of its operation. Another account says that total gold production from the Neenach mining district was $200,000.

In the 1970s, Neenach was lively, one resident told a reporter. There were community-wide potluck dinners and almost 80 members in the local 4-H Club. Since then, he said, many of the kids moved away as soon as they were able.

==Proposed development==
A portion of nearby Tejon Ranch called Centennial is proposed to be a 23,000-home master-planned community adjacent to Neenach. Civic squares, parks, shops, three fire stations, and other services are proposed. Children would be encouraged to walk to one of the eight elementary schools planned. The promoters have pledged to create 30,000 local jobs. On average, a new house would be erected every eight hours, seven days a week, for 20 years.

The Tucson, Arizona,-based Center for Biological Diversity opposes the project—claiming that Centennial would be built on rare ecosystems, including the largest native grassland left in California.

==Services==

=== Library ===
The Los Angeles County Library&#x27;s Antelope Valley bookmobile is at the Neenach market on Saturdays from 11 to noon.

===Schools===


The present Neenach School building was opened in 1993 to replace an older building that had stood for decades on a neighboring lot. The school was closed in 2001 because of dwindling population and high heating costs; lack of a natural-gas source meant the school was all-electric. Sixty-six pupils were enrolled the previous year.

Neenach is part of the Westside Union School District of West Lancaster, which also operates Del Sur, Joe Walker, Hill View, Cottonwood, Rancho Vista, Sundown, Valley View, Leona Valley, and Quartz Hill schools, through the eighth grade. 

The community is within the Antelope Valley Union High School District and the Antelope Valley Community College District.

==Natural phenomena==

===Volcanic formations===

The Neenach Volcanic Formations, about 23.5 million years old, are a series of igneous intrusions next to Old Post Road paralleling Interstate 5 near Gorman, California. Plate movement along the San Andreas Fault split the formations and moved half of them about two hundred miles north into what is now Pinnacles National Park.

===Meteorite===

The Neenach Meteorite is a 30-pound mass of stony, ordinary chondrite discovered in April 1948 by Elden Snyder of Neenach when he unearthed it with his plow, in the process breaking it into four pieces. In 1952 it was brought to the attention of Robert Wallace Webb of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Later it was donated to the collection of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Los Angeles.

==Communication==
The ZIP Code is 93536, served by the Lancaster post office, and the telephone system is part of area code 661.

<text>Jeong Hyeon-cheol (; born February 21, 1972), better known as Seo Taiji or Seo Tae-ji (), is a South Korean singer, musician, songwriter and record producer. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, he rose to become one of the most prominent and influential cultural icons in South Korea, with many referring to him as &quot;the President of Culture&quot;.

Following a brief stint in the heavy metal band Sinawe, Taiji formed Seo Taiji and Boys in 1991 with whom he found immediate success. Their style of music, dance, fashion, and self-presentation resonated with the young generation—termed the sinsedae, &quot;new generation.&quot; They incorporated elements of popular musical genres from the West and contributed considerably larger to Korean pop culture and Korean pop&#x27;s development in the 1990s. His songs addressed social and political concerns of the youth including the stressful and stifling system of education in Korea, and the rage of youth in the face of poor social and economic outlook. Widespread youth backlash to government suppression of the social commentary in his music became a catalyst for the abolishment of censorship of Korean popular music lyrics. His career paved the way for free expression in Korean pop music. Although he initially announced retirement upon disbanding the group in 1996, Taiji released his first solo album two years later and continued his successful career.

==Biography==

===Early career with Sinawe===
At an early age, Jeong Hyeon-cheol had a fascination with music. At 14, he participated in several amateur rock bands. He took the stage name of &quot;Seo Taiji&quot; at age 17, when he was recruited into the heavy metal band Sinawe as bass guitarist by Shin Daechul. He chose to drop out of school because he felt that continuing to be enrolled in school would not be useful in pursuing a career in music.

===Seo Taiji and Boys: 1992–1996===

Seo Taiji and Boys was a seminal South Korean boy band. Although also including Yang Hyun-suk and Lee Juno, Taiji was the leader and main songwriter and began his signature of mixing many different genres of music. They had several controversies with songs and lyrics, but became the first modern highly successful band in the South Korean music industry. The popularity of their music marked a departure from the trot style of music that previously dominated Korea&#x27;s popular music scene.

===Solo career: 1998–present===

====1998: &quot;Seo Tai Ji&quot;====
Two years after Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; retirement, Taiji resumed his career as a musician and solo act, which has been and continues to be successful. He sought to return to his true roots and perform rock music. Without any appearances or activity in South Korea, he released an album with a couple of music videos in 1998. There was some controversy over his sudden reversal of retirement, but his first Solo album &quot;Seo Tai Ji&quot; sold more than a million copies, even without any promotion in Korea. His first solo work included heavy metal and nu metal songs, but the main genre was still alternative rock. Although it was his first solo work, fans refer to it as his 5th album.

==== 2000–2004: &quot;Ultramania&quot; and &quot;7th Issue&quot;====

In 2000, he returned to South Korea after a four-year absence. On the day of his arrival at the Kimpo International Airport in Seoul, the entire airport had been crowded by thousands of fans and media trying to get the first look at Seo Taiji.

He released the album &quot;Ultramania&quot; which consisted of nu metal and Hardcore punk. His solo act had an effect on many South Korean boy bands such as H.O.T. and caused them to decline in popularity. His songs &quot;Internet War&quot; and &quot;Ultramania&quot; were the biggest hits of the year. After the first ETPFEST in 2001, which he founded during his comeback, Taiji was presented with hide of X Japan&#x27;s Fernandes MG-360S guitar, which is yellow with pink hearts, by hide&#x27;s parents and his brother, Hiroshi, to celebrate the success of ETPFEST and the first hide showcase tribute ever at a Korean rock festival.

Seo Taiji maintained his nu metal sound in his third solo album, &quot;7th Issue&quot;. However, unlike &quot;Ultramania&quot;, &quot;7th Issue&quot; was recorded mostly on a dropped C tuning, which gave the effect of the album sounding like one long song. Nevertheless, it had no problem attracting attention to a wide range of audiences. &quot;7th Issue&#x27;s&quot; catchy rock tune made his fans call it &quot;punk rock&quot;. Also, he obviously added Drum and Bass sound into his several songs, so that it proved him to be a favorable electronica musician (skills he learned from producing the &quot;Seo Taiji and Boys&quot; albums). J from Luna Sea also participated in the making of this album as the bassist. His song &quot;Live Wire&quot; was a good hit succeeding the vivacity of &quot;Ultramania&quot;. &quot;Robot&quot; deals with his youth and anguish, while the song &quot;F.M.Business&quot; acrimoniously criticize the issues of and the commercialized music business and the artist exploitation from greedy corporate record labels. He also touches on the issue of abortion along with sexism and sexual assault with the song, &quot;Victim&quot;. His record sale was reduced to a half million due to on-line downloading services, but was still the highest selling record of 2004 in South Korea. Taiji proved himself to be a musician in top popularity for more than a decade. After being active up to 2005, he once again suddenly disappeared out of the spotlight.

==== 2008–2009: &quot;8th Atomos&quot; ====

Seo returned to South Korea after a long absence, and revealed his latest single &quot;Moai&quot;. It was the first release of Seo Taiji&#x27;s ambitious 3-part &quot;mystery project&quot;, which was followed by another single, &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; which was put up as a digital single. The third part, Atomos Part Secret, was released on March 10. He had a promotion called &quot;Missing Taiji&quot;, where there were false rumors that Taiji went missing, only to return on the &quot;Wormhole&quot; concert day. In his single &quot;Moai&quot;, Taiji reinvents his sound, and introduces a new experimental style he calls &quot;nature pound&quot;. &quot;Moai&quot; draws inspiration from the mysterious statues of Easter Island which had long fascinated him since his childhood. He performed at the 2008 ETPFEST which he spearheaded to promote his comeback alongside bands such as The Used, Dragon Ash, Death Cab for Cutie and Marilyn Manson.

Seo also put together &quot;The Great Seotaiji Symphony&quot; with Tolga Kashif and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to perform his old hits and new songs presented in an entirely new form, combining rock and classical music. The main concert was held at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. After the main concert, there were complaints about the sound quality not being delivered to the second and third floors at the further ends of the stadium and to make up for this mistake, another encore performance (same setlist) was held in December at a closed/indoor venue, Jamsil Gymnasium upgraded with better sound systems.

Seo&#x27;s second single, following Atomos Part Moai, called Atomos Part Secret was released on March 10, 2009. It is the same date as the arrival of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to Mars in 2006. Taiji also held a concert promoting his second single on March 14 and 15. Tickets for the concert, cryptically titled Wormhole, sold out in just 20 minutes.

Seo&#x27;s 15th anniversary album consisted of most of his works so far, re-recorded and re-mastered but it was released in a limited edition with only 15,000 copies available, each with unique serial numbers. Serial numbers #1–15 were purchased by Seotaiji himself. He kept No. 1 for himself, gave No. 2 and No. 3 to his old time friends Lee Juno and Yang Hyun Suk, and the rest to his close friends. Since the re-recorded and re-mastered songs were only available for the limited anniversary album and not all the fans were able to purchase it, he decided to re-release all the albums with the containing the new versions. On April 3, the first two Seo Taiji and Boys Albums were rereleased. Taiji will rerelease all 7 of his albums, from Nan Arayo! to 7th Issue. On May 25, the 3rd and 4th Seo Taiji and Boys albums were rereleased.

On June 13, Seo held a nationwide tour named &quot;The Möbius&quot;. The first of the concerts was held in Seoul, Korea. The tour has ended, but a repeat performance was given 2 months after the finish. ETPFEST 2009 was also held with guest groups such as NIN, Limp Bizkit, Keane, Fade, Boom Boom Satellites, Pia and GUMX.

====2014–present: &quot;Quiet Night&quot; and 25th anniversary====

In 2013, Seo Taiji announced that he had been working on a new album. The first single from the new album, &quot;Sogyeokdong&quot;, was released in October 2014. The single was released in two parts: first part, a collaboration with IU, was released October 2, and the second part on October 10. The album, &quot;Quiet Night&quot;, was released on October 20.

In April 2017 it was announced that Seo Taiji was assembling a group of modern K-Pop acts to cover songs from his past to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his debut with Seo Taiji and Boys. The first act announced for the project was BTS, with other acts including Urban Zakapa and Younha. The first single from this project, a cover of &quot;Come Back Home&quot; (from &quot;Seo Taiji and Boys IV&quot;) recorded by BTS, was released with a music video on July 5, 2017. The next song, a cover of &quot;Moai&quot; (from &quot;Atomos&quot;), was released on July 11, performed by Urban Zakapa.

==Personal life==
On April 21, 2011, &quot;Sports Seoul&quot; broke the story (later confirmed by numerous media outlets) that Seo Taiji had secretly married actress Lee Ji-ah (real name Kim Sang-eun) from October 12, 1997, until August 9, 2006. Their union was kept secret because both Seo and Lee notoriously kept their personal lives hidden from the media. The couple first met in 1993, and after Seo temporarily retired in 1996, they got married in 1997 and lived in Atlanta and Arizona, until Seo&#x27;s return to Korea in June 2000. They were separated since the return. Lee filed for divorce in the U.S. in 2006, citing both lifestyle and personality differences. According to Seo, the divorce was finalized in 2006, which Lee disputed, stating it had been 2009. In January 2011, Lee sued Seo for of her share of matrimonial properties and in alimony, and court papers caused their relationship to go public in April. Seo&#x27;s estimated worth at the time was reported between ($35–44 million US). After a six-month lawsuit, an out-of-court settlement was reached on the alimony and division of assets in July 2011. In August 2014, Seo released a statement denying several of Lee&#x27;s claims about their marriage when she made a guest appearance on the talk show &quot;Healing Camp, Aren&#x27;t You Happy&quot;.

Seo married actress Lee Eun-sung, with whom he shares a sixteen-year age gap, on June 26, 2013, at Seo&#x27;s newly built home in affluent Pyeongchang-dong in northern Seoul (he used to live in Yeonhui-dong), with only family members present. They met in 2008 when Lee appeared in the music video for &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; (on Seo&#x27;s eighth album), and began dating in late 2009. Their first child, a daughter, was born on August 27, 2014.

==Seo Taiji Band==
Although Taiji now works as a &quot;solo&quot; artist, the following musicians consistently play with him during tours, studio recordings, and music videos. Some of them belong to other bands, but they participated in recording and performances for a short period of time.:

<doc id="916817" wikidata="Q5447774" url="?curid=916817" title="Fight Songs (Old 97's album)">
<text>Fight Songs is the fourth studio album by American alternative country band Old 97&#x27;s, first released on April 27, 1999. It features the song &quot;Murder (Or a Heart Attack)&quot;, which was ranked #176 on &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;500 Greatest Songs From 1980-2005.&quot;

The group&#x27;s second record on Elektra Records, &quot;Fight Songs&quot; is more slick and pop-oriented than the group&#x27;s previous efforts, a trend continued on 2001&#x27;s &quot;Satellite Rides&quot;. The song &quot;Crash on the Barrelhead&quot; is rumored to be targeted at alt-country rival, Ryan Adams, while &quot;Murder ...&quot; was inspired by a cat owned by singer Miller&#x27;s roommate in Los Angeles.

<text>Llano (Spanish for &quot;plain&quot;) is an unincorporated community located in Los Angeles County, California, United States, near the San Bernardino County line.

== History ==
&quot;Llano&quot; is a name derived from Spanish meaning &quot;plain&quot;.

The ruins of Llano del Rio are still extant along Highway 138 east of 165th Street East. The socialist community moved and Llano del Rio was abandoned in 1918, leaving behind the &quot;ghost&quot; of an alternative future for Los Angeles.

== Geography ==
Llano is located about southeast of Palmdale in the Antelope Valley portion of Southern California. The town of Pearblossom lies to the west, while the town of Piñon Hills lies to the east. It is a few miles from the San Gabriel Mountains

Pearblossom Highway (as State Route 18), and Pearblossom Highway (as State Route 138) runs through the heart of Llano and is its 2 principal streets.

==Notable residents==
* Aldous Huxley&#x27;s former home, now Pearblossom Picture Ranch, a filming location

<text>Halsten Stenkilsson (English exonym: &quot;Alstan&quot;; Old Icelandic: &quot;Hallstein&quot;) was King of Sweden from c. 1067 - 1070. The son of King Stenkil and a Swedish princess, he became king some time after his father&#x27;s death (1066), and he may have ruled together with his brother Inge the Elder. 
The date of his death is not known.

==Brief kingship==

Little is known of his time as king. In a &quot;scholia&quot; in the work of Adam of Bremen, he is reported to have been elected king after the violent death of two pretenders, but took over a highly volatile situation. While he was clearly a Christian like his father and brother, his influence may have been limited, since Adam relates that Christianity was so disturbed that the bishops appointed by the Archdiocese of Bremen did not even dare to travel to Sweden. He was deposed after a short while, in the late 1060s or early 1070s, and replaced by a princeling from Gardariki, Anund.

==Possible later reign==

That he later on ruled together with his brother Inge has some support from a papal letter from 1081, by Pope Gregory VII, which refers to two kings with the initials &quot;A&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, and where they are called kings of Västergötland (&quot;rege wisigothorum&quot;). However, the king &quot;A&quot; could also be Håkan the Red. His co-rulership with his brother Inge is also mentioned in the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;. In the regnal list of the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;, he is said to have been courteous and cheerful, and whenever a case was submitted to him, he judged fairly, and this was why Sweden mourned his death. He was the father of the co-rulers Philip and Inge the Younger.

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, which is one of the few sources about the kings of this time, has the following to tell:

<text>Anund from Russia () was King of Sweden around 1070 according to Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot;. According to this source, Anund came from Kievan Rus&#x27;, presumably from Aldeigjuborg. &quot;Gårdske&quot; means that he came from &quot;Gardariki&quot; which was one of the Scandinavian names for Kievan Rus&#x27;.

As a Christian he refused to carry out the public sacrifice to the Norse gods, presumably at the Temple at Uppsala, and was consequently deposed. He &quot;left the Thing in joy, for having been found worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus&quot;. This happened shortly before the completion of Adam of Bremen&#x27;s chronicle in the mid-1070s.

A hypothesis suggests that Anund and Inge the Elder were the same person, as several sources mention Inge as a fervent Christian, and the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; describes how Inge also was rejected for refusing to administer the blóts and that he was exiled in Västergötland.

<doc id="916833" wikidata="Q537489" url="?curid=916833" title="Håkan the Red">
<text>Håkan the Red (Swedish: &quot;Håkan Röde&quot;) was a King of Sweden, reigning for about half a decade in the second half of the 11th century. There is little information on him, and it is mostly contradictory. Nothing is known about his reign.

Swedish historian Adolf Schück has asserted that, rather than &quot;Blot-Sweyn&quot; being an individual king, there are indications that that may have been an epithet for King Håkan. 

His cognomen &quot;the Red&quot; comes from the regnal list of the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;, written in early 13th century. The same source claims that he was born in Levene, in Västergötland.

==Succession sequence==

Despite contradiction in the sources, Håkan&#x27;s position as a &quot;successor&quot; of Stenkil in the line of Swedish kings is generally accepted as correct. Perhaps he reigned from c. 1066/1070 in some areas of Sweden (succeeding Stenkil or Halsten Stenkilsson), and from c. 1075 in Uppland as well (succeeding Anund Gårdske). The regnal line in &quot;Nationalencyklopedin&quot; omits Anund Gårdske and presents Håkan as successor of Halsten Stenkilsson. Nationalencyclopedin also suggests that he may have ruled jointly with Inge the Elder in the 1080s. A papal letter from Gregory VII is addressed to Inge together with either Håkan or Halsten Stenkilsson as kings of the västgötar, ordering them to collect tithe and send priests to Rome to educate themselves.

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;[a]t the end of the Viking Age [approximately 1050], Sweden remained a loose federation of provinces. The old family of kings died out in 1060; after the death of the last of these kings&#x27; son-in-law, Stenkil, in 1066, a civil war broke out. Around 1080 Stenkil&#x27;s sons, Ingi and Halsten, ruled, [...].&quot; If &quot;civil war&quot; is an appropriate characterisation of the period from 1066 to 1080, the rulers of that epoch would be in the grey area between &quot;king&quot; and &quot;warlord&quot;. Describing this period for Sweden as a whole in a linear translatio imperii kind of regnal succession, can then only be achieved at least partially based on speculative historical reconstruction, which appears to have happened in diverging directions from the early 13th century on, at the latest.

===Adam of Bremen===
A scholion in Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen&quot; (written 1070s–early 1080s) says that Håkan was elected king after Stenkil&#x27;s son Halsten had been deposed, and after Anund Gårdske also had been rejected. At his enthronement he was obliged to &quot;take the mother of young Olof in marriage&quot;. It is not clear from Adam&#x27;s text which Olof is meant, but it has been suggested that he might be King Olav Kyrre of Norway, whose mother Tora Torbergsdatter was a cognatic descendant of the Norwegian branch of the Yngling dynasty. While this remains unproven, the marriage was probably a politically well-planned act to gain support for Håkan&#x27;s rule. Historian Sture Bolin has argued that the passage about Olof&#x27;s mother in fact refers to Tora Torbergsdotter marrying the Danish King Sweyn Estridsen, and has nothing to do with Håkan. However, while Adam of Bremen mentions a Tora at Sweyn&#x27;s court, he characterises her as his concubine rather than wife.

===Regnal list of the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;===
According to the regnal list of the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;, Håkan the Red would have ruled 13 years, as Stenkil&#x27;s &quot;predecessor&quot;. He was born in Levene in Viste Hundred in Västergötland, and was buried there after his demise. The Levene estate is also associated with King Stenkil, suggesting that Håkan might have sprung from the same kin group. Another Swedish king list from the 13th century has the sequence Stenkil - Halsten - Näskonung - Blot-Sweyn - Håkan the Red (Haquinus rufus) - Inge the Elder.

===Sagas===
In &quot;Magnus Barefoot&#x27;s Saga&quot;, a part of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (1225), he is given as the &quot;successor&quot; of Stenkil (who died in 1066):
Steinkel, the Swedish king, died about the same time as the two Haralds fell, and the king who came after him in
Svithjod was called Håkan. Afterwards Inge, a son of Steinkel,
was king, [...]

Similarly, in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; (13th century):Steinkel had a son called Ingi, who became King of Sweden after Håkan.

==Runestone==
Presumably it was Håkan the Red who ordered the carving of a runestone found in Hovgården (Adelsö island in Lake Mälaren, Uppland, Sweden). The Rundata catalog number of this runestone is U 11.

<text>St Aidan&#x27;s College is a college of Durham University in England. It had its origins in 1895 as the association of women home students, formalised in 1947 as St Aidan&#x27;s Society. In 1961, it became a full college of the university, and in 1964 moved to new modernist buildings on Elvet Hill designed by Sir Basil Spence.

==History==

The college has its origins in the small group of women, known as home students, who were first allowed to study at Durham in 1895. At that time, and indeed until the Second World War, it was considered unsuitable for female students to live in lodgings: they either had to be members of a college or to live at home. The numbers were never very large; for example, in 1936 there were only five. However, a substantial increase in the number of female students after 1945 meant that the former group of home students was reorganised, emerging as the St Aidan&#x27;s Society in 1947.

The St Aidan&#x27;s Society had its offices at 24 North Bailey (now the bar and club of the Durham Union Society). Some of the students lived in Shincliffe Hall and others in lodgings. A common room was soon found in 50 North Bailey and chapel services held at the church of St Mary-le-Bow. The first principal was Ethleen Scott, having been &quot;Censor&quot; of the female home students since 1937.

In 1961 St Aidan&#x27;s was reconstituted as a full &quot;council college&quot;, meaning that its governing council is a sub-committee of the university council, the university&#x27;s governing body. It moved to its present buildings on Elvet Hill in September 1964, becoming one of the first of the university&#x27;s &quot;Hill&quot; colleges. The college buildings are in a brutalist style, designed by Sir Basil Spence and arranged in a semi-circular arrangement surrounding a central lawn. The original design was intended to represent the hand of God holding a jewel, with the curved corridors as the fingers, the straight corridors as his thumb, and a small chapel as the jewel. However, financial constraints prevented the chapel from ever being built and later extensions to the straight section did not follow the original idea.

In 1963, Scott was succeeded as principal by Dame Enid Russell-Smith, who handed over to Irene Hindmarsh in 1970. It was during her tenure as principal that it was agreed that St Aidan&#x27;s should become a mixed college. The first male students were admitted in 1981.

John Ashworth took over in 1998, before becoming dean of colleges in 2007, at which point Susan Frenk became acting principal. In 2008 work on improvements to the extensions were started. The aim was to turn previous fresher rooms into ensuite accommodation for finalists and postgraduates. The newly refurbished extensions, named the Elizabeth Pease House, were opened to students in 2009.

==Organisation==

The college membership divides itself between the senior common room (SCR) and the junior common room (JCR). The SCR is a self-regulating body of senior members of the university, college officers, tutors and postgraduate students. The JCR consists of the undergraduate members of the college and elects its own officers, including a sabbatical president and a bar steward, who liaise on its behalf with the college and university.

===Principals===
The current principal is Susan Frenk, a lecturer in Spanish and Latin-American culture.

<text>Leona Valley (&quot;Leona&quot;, Spanish for &quot;Lioness&quot;) is a census-designated place located in the geographic Leona Valley of northern Los Angeles County, California, in the transition between the Sierra Pelona Mountains and Mojave Desert, just west of Palmdale and the Antelope Valley. The population was 1,607 at the 2010 census.

Leona Valley is best known for its agriculture, particularly cherries and wine grapes. The town of Leona Valley holds its annual &quot;Leona Valley Cherry Festival&quot; in honor of its agricultural heritage.

==Geography==
Leona Valley is located about west of the Palmdale Civic Center in Southern California. Leona Valley town is located in its namesake, Leona Valley. This valley is a long narrow valley separated from the Antelope Valley by the San Andreas Fault ridge, known as Ritter Ridge, so named after one of the settlers from Nebraska in the 1880s. The valley is about a mile wide and in length. The geographic Leona Valley is also home to the towns of Lake Hughes and Lake Elizabeth.

The ZIP Code is 93551 and the community is inside area code 661.

==History==
Leona Valley&#x27;s post colonial history can be best described as land abundant with cattle ranches. In the late 18th century, after the loss of the Tataviam Native Americans – the area&#x27;s original inhabitants – to Indian Reductions as Mission Indians at the Mission San Fernando immigrants from Spain and Mexico quickly established themselves. The majority of the immigrants were primarily interested in the land in order to establish cattle ranches. During the 1830s, the ranches were broken up into smaller homesteads by farmers from Germany, France and the state of Nebraska. The Ritter family started one of the first wineries in this country in Leona Valley which was later shut down by the U.S. Prohibition period in the early 20th century.

In 1901 Frank D Hall bought the 3000 acre St. Anthony Ranch. The valley was then known as Leonis and he changed the name of the ranch to Leona Valley Ranch and set about building a dairy farm. The Ranch was most of the land west of Bouquet Canyon Rd.
The dairy did not work out and the subdivision of the Leona Valley Ranch started in 1918. That first phase of the subdivision was for properties that had roads and water (either had water or was in an area known to be practical for drilling a well). One of the early sales was the southwest corner of Elizabeth Lake Rd and 90th St West. The Nolenberger&#x27;s built a store and gas station on that lot which opened in 1924. The building is now Hemme Hay and Feed store. In 1927 Frank Hall incorporated Farm Home Builders to handle the next phase that required new roads and a water system. To that end Farm Home Builders took out a loan for $45,000. The Great Depression hit before many sold and it wasn&#x27;t until the 1940s that most were sold.

The majority of those old large homestead parcels have since been partially subdivided and developed with a mix of custom residences, with Leona Valley still maintaining a spacious beauty.

<doc id="916850" wikidata="Q7594473" url="?curid=916850" title="St Mary's College, Durham">
<text>St Mary’s College is a constituent college of Durham University. It is located mainly on Elvet Hill to the South of the city centre, becoming the first of Durham’s “hill colleges”. Following the grant of a supplemental charter in 1895 allowing women to receive degrees of the university, St Mary&#x27;s was founded as a women’s only college called the Women’s Hostel in 1899, adopting its present name in May 1920. It enjoys a reputation as one of the most attractive colleges of Durham because of its neoclassical architecture and picturesque landscape.

The college is co-educational, having only begun to admit men in 2005, the last of Durham’s original single-sex colleges to do so. The college has 750 undergraduate students, around 150 full-time postgraduates students and 200 part-time postgraduate students reading for a Durham degree.

St Mary’s is considered one of the more traditional colleges. It is the only college in Durham that insist on gowns being worn at JCR meetings and also emphasises its use in formal halls. St Mary’s also holds its own matriculation ceremony in addition to the university-wide ceremony held in the Cathedral, where new students sign their name onto the college’s matriculation book, thereby sealing an oath to adhere to its customs and traditions. It also host 3 balls in an academic year, which are the Winter Ball in Michaelmas term, the Masquerade Ball in Epiphany term, and the Midsummer Ball in Easter term.

==History==
===Founding===

St Mary&#x27;s first home was at 33 Claypath with six students, before moving into Abbey House on Palace Green, then to 9 The college behind Durham Cathedral, which is now occupied by the Chorister School.

In 1952, it moved to a new site on Elvet Hill, becoming the first of the &quot;hill colleges&quot;. The foundation stone for the new building, now known as the Fergusson Building, was laid in 1947 by Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). St Mary&#x27;s is the only one of the hill colleges to have been founded in the 19th century.

===Change to a mixed college===
For several decades there had been debates about St Mary&#x27;s continuing as a single-sex college within the university, and it had been originally mooted in the 1970s that it should go mixed. The Middle Common Room, which consisted of postgraduate students, went mixed in the early 1990s, and by the early twenty-first century had elected its first male MCR President (John Newton held the post from 2000 to 2001). St Mary&#x27;s was the last of Durham&#x27;s colleges to become entirely mixed when it took in both males and females at undergraduate level in 2005, ending over a hundred years of tradition. During the decision-making process the student body was split. Some members of the college felt so strongly against the proposed plans in 2000 that they protested, marching on the University Offices at Old Shire Hall. There had been several polls of the student body over the issue of the college going mixed, and from 1999 onwards these were held almost annually. The results tended to be close, but marginally in favour of retaining the status quo.

The transition to a mixed college took place in 2005, and the first male JCR President, James Liddell, was elected in 2009. The college still provides single-sex accommodation for both sexes as and when required. The recently refurbished Shepherd wing of the Fergusson building is a segregated women&#x27;s-only area for students who, for personal, religious or other reasons, would prefer single sex accommodation. A refurbishment of the Williamson building took place between July and December 2007.

==Facilities and traditions==

The college is centred on two main buildings: the Fergusson and Williamson Buildings. The Fergusson building, designed by Vincent Harris, was built in the early 1950s and houses most of the college facilities, including the college&#x27;s dining hall, two computer rooms, the college library, the chapel, a laundry, two student common rooms and three music rooms. The chapel is located on the top floor of the North East wing and was designed by the ecclesiastical architect George Pace. In addition to interiors and furniture produced by Thompson of Kilburn (the Mouseman), it now houses a sculpture of the Blessed Virgin Mary by acclaimed sculptor Fenwick Lawson, which was commissioned in 2005 by the college.The basement location of the Chapel prior to the 1960s now houses the JCR Bar which is managed by a Student Sabbatical Bars Steward. Opposite the Bar entrance is the Toastie Bar. At the other end of the basement is the JCR Shop which stocks sweets and snacks as well as toiletries, college clothing and some memorabilia.

The Williamson building was built in the early 1960s and is mainly an accommodation block with 110 study bedrooms. On the ground floor there is a student common room and one half of the lower ground floor contains the JCR fitness room and a laundry.

In the 1990s three ensuite blocks were built on to the front of the Williamson building and are the only ensuite rooms in the college, with the exception of a few located in the Shepherd Wing. These are mainly filled by 2nd, 3rd or 4th year students who move back into college accommodation, but some are made available to students from any year group who require an ensuite room for medical or personal reasons.

In 2015, principal Simon Hackett opened the new Boughton Wing in Williamson building which was established to maintain this provision and provide women-only accommodation to those who require it.

==Student life==
The majority of students located on site are first years, who are required to &#x27;live in&#x27;. These students change rooms each term using a &#x27;room ballot&#x27; system to ensure that no-one has to share a room for more than one term of their first year. 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students often choose to &#x27;live out&#x27; in houses around Durham, although accommodation is available on-site for those who want it. The room ballot ceased to operate at the start of the 2015–2016 academic year and those who lived in kept their rooms for the whole academic year. All those who live on site are fully catered, except in exceptional circumstances.

The college requires the wearing of gowns at formal dinners, which are held between two and three times a term and on the first and last Sunday of each term. Further to this the college requires gowns to be worn at JCR meetings and Matriculation.

Large student led events are held throughout the year, notable highlights include Masquerade Ball, Midsummer Ball and Mary&#x27;s Day. 

The college also has its own boat club, St Mary&#x27;s College Boat Club (SMBC),which welcomes any members of the college to join in and participate. SMBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code &quot;SMC&quot; and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing.

==College shield and arms==
The college arms are blazoned as &quot;Argent a Cross Formy Quadrate Gules a Chief Azure thereon a Durham Mitre Or between two Lilies proper.&quot;

The college&#x27;s motto is &quot;Ancilla Domini&quot; and can be translated to &quot;Handmaiden of the Lord.&quot;

<text>Anne Meacham (July 21, 1925 — January 12, 2006) was an American actress of stage, film and television.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Chicago, Meacham left to study drama at Yale University and the Neighborhood Playhouse, New York. She debuted on Broadway as Ensign Jane Hilton in the 1952 &quot;The Long Watch&quot;, for which she received a Clarence Derwent Award, a prize for newcomers to the New York stage.

She appeared in many on- and off-Broadway productions, often adaptations of plays written by Tennessee Williams, such as &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot;, &quot;The Gnädiges Fräulein&quot; and &quot;In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel&quot;. For her interpretation of the role of Catherine Holly in &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; (played by Elizabeth Taylor in the film version), she received an Obie Award as Best Actress.

Other Broadway appearances included Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;Ondine&quot;, &quot;Eugenia&quot;, an adaptation of Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Europeans&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot; and &quot;The Seagull&quot;. She received a second Obie award for her performance in Hedda Gabler in 1961. Her last Broadway appearance was as Gertrude in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; in 1968.

Meacham made many TV appearances since the 1950s and made her film debut in Robert Rossen&#x27;s 1964 &quot;Lilith&quot;. She was a long-lasting cast member of the TV series &quot;Another World&quot;.

She died from undisclosed causes in Canaan, New York, on January 12, 2006, aged 80. Her death was reported by her friend, actress Marian Seldes.

<doc id="916853" wikidata="Q7632742" url="?curid=916853" title="Succès de scandale">
<text>Succès de scandale (French for &quot;success from scandal&quot;) is a term for any artistic work whose success is attributed, in whole or in part, to public controversy surrounding the work. In some cases the controversy causes audiences to seek out the work for its titillating content, while in others it simply heightens public curiosity. This concept is echoed by the phrase &quot;there is no such thing as bad publicity&quot;.

==&quot;Belle Époque&quot;==

The &quot;Belle Époque&quot; (&#x27;beautiful era&#x27;) in Paris, roughly from 1871 to 1914, was notable for many &quot;succès de scandale&quot;. This was also where and when the term originated. In the examples below, artists started their careers with some sort of scandal, with some connection to turn-of-the-century Paris. In other cities, provoking a scandal appeared more risky, as Oscar Wilde found out shortly after his relatively &quot;successful&quot; Parisian scandal (&quot;Salomé&quot; in 1894, portraying the main character as a necrophile).

* &quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; (&quot;Luncheon on the Grass&quot;) by Édouard Manet, presented at the Salon des refusés, 1863: Even the Emperor was scandalised, but Manet had a nice start to his career.
* Alfred Jarry shocked Paris in 1896 with the first of his absurdistic Ubu plays: &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;. The performance of this play was forbidden after the first night, though Jarry got around the prohibition by moving the production to a puppet theatre.
*A new group of artists, labeled disrespectfully &quot;Les Fauves&quot; (&quot;The Wild Beasts&quot;) by an art critic, had their successful debut in 1905 Paris (and kept the name).
* Richard Strauss had little success with his first two operas, which today are no longer performed. He then tried something different: he set music to Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; in 1905. It created a scandal, including in the New York Met, where the production had to be closed after one night. But Strauss wanted more, and his next opera (&quot;Elektra&quot;, 1909) was so &quot;noisy&quot; that cartoons appeared with Strauss directing an orchestra of animals. However, the opera&#x27;s libretto, written by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, was quite tame.
*The 1912 ballet &quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot;, choreographed and headed by Vaslav Nijinsky, provoked strong reactions. The newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; wrote in a front-page review that the &quot;movements are filthy and bestial in their eroticism&quot;. Despite, or because of, this criticism, the ballet was sold-out in Paris.
*&quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913)
*The original 1917 production of the ballet &quot;Parade&quot;.
*George Antheil&#x27;s 1923 performance of futurist piano music at the Champs-Élysées theater.
*Paul Chabas had won a most prestigious prize with his &quot;September Morn&quot; in Paris in 1912. Nudity as portrayed in this painting was, however, far from shocking to Parisians half a century after &quot;Déjeuner&quot;. The market value of the painting remained low. Then, Chabas put it on display in a New York shop window in 1913. There, for the first time in history, it appears a &quot;succès de scandale&quot; scheme was set up by a publicity agent (Harry Reichenbach), who &quot;accidentally&quot; tipped off a morality crusader to the picture. The scandal that evolved brought financial success and secured Chabas&#x27;s place in art history books. Although later deemed kitsch, the painting ended up in one of the most prestigious museums of New York.

==Other examples==
Paul Chabas&#x27;s &quot;September Morn&quot; was not the last time that Comstockery fanned the success it wanted to prohibit: Mae West quipped &quot;I believe in censorship. I made a fortune out of it.&quot; after the Society for the Suppression of Vice had maneuvered to get her play &quot;Sex&quot; re-censored by the Police Department Play Jury. A few years later, when she was over 40 years old, her sex-symbol status paid off when by 1933, West was one of the largest box-office draws in the United States and, by 1935, she was also the highest paid woman and the second-highest paid person in the United States (after William Randolph Hearst).

Films qualified as &quot;succès de scandale&quot; include Louis Malle&#x27;s 1958 &quot;The Lovers&quot;, Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1972 &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. and more recently Abdellatif Kechiche&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Blue Is the Warmest Colour&quot;. Scandal also boosted the success of writers of modest talent. Even famous writers like Flaubert and Joyce have been described as deploying &quot;succès de scandale&quot; recipes to their advantage.

<text>eToro is an Israeli social trading and multi-asset investment company focused on CFD offerings. eToro was founded in 2007 in Tel Aviv by Yoni Assia, Ronen Assia, and David Ring. The company&#x27;s headquarters are located in Central Israel. At the start of 2024, eToro had 35.5 million registered users, and over 3 million funded accounts. 

eToro has faced regulatory scrutiny and criticism from authorities in the US, Canada, India, Italy, and the Philippines. The company&#x27;s business model has been criticized for profiting from customer losses, lacking transparency, and has been fined in multiple countries for operating without licenses and engaging in misleading advertising practices.

== History ==
eToro was founded as RetailFX in 2007 in Tel Aviv, by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia together with David Ring. In 2010, the firm released the eToro OpenBook social investment platform. This included the CopyTrader feature, enabling users to replicate the trading strategies of top-performing investors automatically. Later that year, the firm released an Android app.

Between 2007 and 2013, the company raised $31.5 million across four funding rounds. By December 2014, it had secured an additional $27 million from Russian and Chinese investors. 

In 2013, eToro expanded its product range, allowing investments in stocks and CFDs alongside commodities and currencies, with an initial offering of 110 stocks that later grew to over 3,000 financial products. The same year, it was authorized to provide services in the UK under its eToro UK subsidiary. By 2014, some referred to eToro as &quot;Israel&#x27;s biggest export.&quot; In January 2014, the company added cryptocurrencies to its available instruments, and later that year, it introduced currency futures investments for the Russian ruble and Chinese yuan.

In December 2017, eToro partnered with CoinDash to develop blockchain-based social trading. The following year, it raised $100 million in private funding, bringing total investment to over $162 million from various firms.

In March 2019, eToro acquired Danish blockchain company Firmo. In October 2019, eToro released a sentiment-based crypto portfolio that uses AI to assess Twitter&#x27;s real-time sentiment on digital asset. Shortly after, in November 2019, eToro acquired Delta, a crypto portfolio tracking app based in Belgium. In March 2019, the company launched its cryptocurrency trading platform and standalone cryptocurrency wallet for US users.

Financially, 2020 proved a landmark year for eToro, with a 147% year-over-year growth, a 275% increase in funded accounts, and a gross revenue of $605 million. The company reported 1.2 million funded accounts, managed by a team of 1,100 employees worldwide. That year, eToro also acquired Marq Millions, its UK e-money division, rebranding it as eToro Money, and obtained Visa&#x27;s primary membership along with an electronic money institution (EMI) license from the UK&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority. In December 2021, it launched the eToro Money debit card for UK residents. In 2021, the company reported operating in 140 countries and having 20 million users. 

In March 2021, eToro announced plans to go public via a merger with FinTech Acquisition Corp V (NASDAQ:FTCV), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by former Bancorp CEO Betsy Z. Cohen. The combined entity was expected to operate as eToro Group Ltd with an implied enterprise value of $10.4 billion, supported by $650 million in funding from private investment funds. However, due to market instability and internal challenges within the SPAC, including &quot;material weaknesses&quot; in its financial controls, the deal was canceled by mid-2022. By that time, eToro had invested heavily in preparation for the IPO, contributing to a net loss of $265 million for 2021. Following the cancellation, eToro implemented cost-cutting measures, including laying off approximately 100 employees, or around 6% of its workforce, to stabilize its finances. 

In August 2022, eToro signed a definitive agreement to acquire Gatsby, a fintech startup specializing in options and stock trading, for $50 million in cash and stock. In April 2023, the company announced a partnership with Twitter to allow users to click on ticker symbols preceded by a dollar sign, redirecting them to an eToro trading page.

In 2023, eToro completed a $250 million funding round that valued the company at $3.5 billion, a stark contrast to its initial $10 billion valuation target. However, eToro&#x27;s financial performance in 2023 showed mixed results: eToro UK reported a 14% drop in net income and a 28% decrease in comprehensive income.

In July 2024, eToro announced a partnership with the London Stock Exchange, aiming to add over 1,000 new UK stocks in the coming months. That month, it also collaborated with Bocconi University and joined the European FS Financial Services Tech Hub. In September 2024, eToro acquired the Australian app Spaceship for nearly $55 million.

In March 2024, the company announced that it is considering New York or London as potential venues for an initial public offering (IPO). In December 2024, eToro hired Goldman Sachs to lead its IPO in the United States, planned for 2025. In January 2025, eToro confidentially filed documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming for a valuation exceeding $5 billion. The company intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ in the second quarter of 2025.

==Operations==
eToro&#x27;s primary research and development hub is based in Tel Aviv, Israel. The company operates under regulatory oversight from several major authorities: CySEC in the EU, FCA in the UK, FinCEN in the United States, and ASIC in Australia. As of 2022, eToro maintained operations in 140 countries.

The company&#x27;s business model, centered around Contracts for Difference (CFDs), has faced significant criticism. CFDs are high-risk financial products that frequently result in substantial losses for customers. eToro&#x27;s model allows it to profit directly from customer losses, and the company retains the option not to hedge its CFD positions, raising questions about transparency and client interest.

== Marketing ==
eToro is known for substantial investments in marketing, which include sports sponsorships and traditional advertising. In 2020, eToro released a high-profile ad starring Alec Baldwin that quickly accumulated 3 million views on YouTube.

In February 2022, eToro aired its first Super Bowl commercial during Super Bowl LVI, also dubbed the &quot;Crypto Bowl.&quot; The 30-second ad, titled &quot;Flying Your Way,&quot; featured a consumer seeking cryptocurrency advice while crypto enthusiasts descended from the sky, asking, &quot;To the moon?&quot; The commercial also highlighted a Shiba Inu dog, referencing the meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), and included an appearance of a Bored Ape NFT, targeting a crypto-savvy audience.

As of 2024, eToro&#x27;s sponsorship portfolio encompasses five English Premier League clubs (Crystal Palace, Everton, Leicester City, Southampton, and Burnley), five Bundesliga teams (Eintracht Frankfurt, FC Augsburg, 1. FC Köln, Hamburger SV in Bundesliga 2, 1. FC Union Berlin, and VfL Wolfsburg), as well as the UK&#x27;s Premiership Rugby Cup, Spain&#x27;s Basketball Liga ACB, and Rugby Australia. In September 2024, eToro signed a two-year sponsorship agreement with Bayer 04 Leverkusen.

== Controversies ==
Critics argue that eToro&#x27;s business model inherently conflicts with its customers&#x27; interests, as the company directly profits when customers incur losses.

=== CySEC, 2013 ===
In 2013, CySEC fined eToro €50,000 due to weaknesses identified in its organizational and operational structure, dating back to 2010.

=== Quebec Blacklist, 2015 ===
In 2015, Quebec authorities placed eToro on a blacklist of unauthorized foreign companies, citing its encouragement of local residents to invest in binary options through its platform.

=== Leveraged crypto position closures, 2021 ===
On 8 January 2021, eToro informed its European clients that &quot;due to extreme market volatility in the crypto markets,&quot; margin positions for all leveraged crypto positions needed to be converted into non-leveraged. Customers were warned that failure to comply would lead to position closures within four hours.

=== Closure of customer positions in Magnit stock, 2022 ===
On 2 March 2022, eToro liquidated customer positions in Magnit stock (MGNTL.L), compensating customers at $0.01 per share. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Magnit shares were valued at $14.20 per share. Investors holding Russian American (ADRs) and global depository receipts (GDRs) argued that the forced closure was unlawful and initiated a petition, which quickly garnered a thousand signatures, though media reports have not confirmed any subsequent outcomes.

=== Misleading advertising in Italy, 2023 ===
In 2023, the Italian Competition Authority fined eToro €1.3 million for misleading advertising. The Authority found that eToro&#x27;s Italian website promoted zero-commission share trading but did not disclose various costs and financial risks, such as currency exchange fluctuations and operational limitations on customer rights. These omissions led consumers to make choices they might not have otherwise made, in violation of Articles 20, 21, and 22 of the Italian Consumer Code.

=== ASIC lawsuit, 2023 ===
In August 2023, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission filed a case against eToro Aus Capital Limited in Federal Court, alleging that the company of lack of compliance, more specifically, of violation of design and distribution obligations. The screening test for onboarding clients was so lax that nearly anyone could qualify. ASIC argued that eToro&#x27;s target market for CFDs was overly broad for such a high-risk product. Between 5 October 5, 2021 and 14 June 14, 2023, almost 20,000 eToro clients reportedly lost money.

As of November 2024, court proceedings have been postponed eight times.

=== US SEC lawsuit for unregistered crypto trade, 2024 ===
An investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission discovered that since at least 2020, eToro operated as an unregistered broker and clearing agency, facilitating crypto asset trading as securities. On 12 September 2024, eToro USA LLC agreed to pay a $1.5 mln penalty to settle charges, no comments had been given to admit or deny the SEC&#x27;s findings. The US clients were given 180 days to liquidate other crypto positions, with only Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether remaining available for trade.

=== Unlicensed operations ===
==== Malaysia ====
In May 2020, eToro announced the expansion of its commission-free offering to customers in the Asia-Pacific region. In response to eToro&#x27;s announcement, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) publicly stated that eToro was operating without proper licensing in the country.

==== Canada ====
From 2008 to 2017, eToro operated in Canada without a license despite warnings from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). In 2018, eToro agreed to pay a $550,000 fine and an additional $25,000 in costs, and to disgorge nearly US$1.8 million. The company also committed to closing Ontario accounts and blocking its site from Canadian IP addresses.

==== India ====
In September 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India&#x27;s central bank, released a list of 34 forex trading online platforms, in which eToro was also listed as an illegal platform in India.

====Philippines ====
On 14 March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission of The Philippines issued an advisory against eToro. The company was marketing its offerings to Filipinos and allowed them to open accounts without the necessary license, an act punishable in the Philippines with up to 21 years in prison. The company spokesman denied active promotion of its services in the Philippines and highlighted that it has no local presence in the country. In October 2024, the company announced that it will stop operations in the Philippines citing &quot;risk management considerations&quot;. Philippines residents&#x27; access to all accounts will be stopped on 15 February 2025.

=== &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; investigation ===
In July 2021, The Times of Israel published an investigation on eToro, exposing dozens of cases of staffing connections between eToro and Israel&#x27;s largely fraudulent binary options industry. For example, Shmuel Hauser, former chairman of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), joined eToro as an advisory board member after overseeing regulatory decisions that impacted the company. During Hauser&#x27;s ISA tenure from 2011 to 2017, he agreed to modify a Knesset bill that would have restricted eToro&#x27;s operations, which allowed eToro to continue expanding internationally. Although eToro did not engage in binary options, a sector under heavy scrutiny for fraudulent practices, the modified bill exempted companies like eToro from stricter regulations. In the same year, he resigned from his post at ISA amidst several high-profile anti-corruption scandals. After leaving the ISA, Hauser began advising eToro on regulatory issues worldwide. In 2021, Hauser became an advisory board member at eToro. At the same year, eToro announced that it had appointed Hedva Ber, former supervisor of banks at the Bank of Israel, in 2021 was appointed deputy CEO and global COO. 

The Times of Israel also covered the story of Nir Barkat, Likud MK and former mayor of Jerusalem. Barkat was linked to eToro in the &quot;Pandora Papers,&quot; revealing he holds shares in the company, which is registered in the Virgin Islands despite most operations being based in Israel. While mayor, Barkat claimed his assets were under a blind trust, but leaks indicate they remained in his name until he transferred them to his brother upon joining the Knesset in 2019, contrary to Knesset Ethics Committee guidelines. In 2019, Barkat&#x27;s net worth was valued at $139 million.

<doc id="916861" wikidata="Q6422498" url="?curid=916861" title="Knights of the Apocalypse">
<text>The Knights of the Apocalypse was a secret society created in Italy in 1693. It was founded by Agostino Gabrino, the son of a merchant of Brescia to defend the Catholic Church against the expected Antichrist. The organization was accused by contemporaries of having political motives.

Gabrino was responsible for two notable disruptions of church ceremonies in 1693. One occurred on Palm Sunday 1693, when Gabrino rushed the altar of St Peter&#x27;s at Rome with a sword. He yelled &quot;Ego sum Rex Gloriae&quot; (&quot;I am king of glory&quot;) as he attacked the altar, a response to the choir&#x27;s chants of &quot;Quis est iste Rex Gloriae?&quot; (&quot;Who was that king of Glory?&quot;). He also disturbed public worship at the Church of the Holy Savior. Though Gabrino was treated as a madman and confined in a madhouse, the society flourished until one member, a woodcutter, denounced it to the Inquisition, leading to the arrest of eighty knights.

Though chiefly mechanics, tradesmen and labourers, members always carried their swords, even when at work. They also wore a star on their breasts with seven rays, a tail, and surrounded by a golden thread forming a circle representing the globe. The tail of the star represented the sword seen by St. John in the Apocalypse. Gabrino styled himself monarch of the Holy Trinity. He was credited by his enemies with a desire to introduce polygamy and has been accused of an intended rebellion against the papal government. His knights were instructed to only marry pure virgins.

<doc id="916864" wikidata="Q7902193" url="?curid=916864" title="Ustinov College, Durham">
<text>Ustinov College is a constituent college of Durham University. Founded in 1965 as the Graduate Society, it achieved full college status in 2003 and adopted its current name from the then-chancellor of the university, Sir Peter Ustinov. It is Durham’s first and only exclusively postgraduate college, mostly reading for PhD, MA, MSc, and LLM degrees, and is the largest college by number of students both full and part-time. 

The college is located on Sheraton Park in Neville&#x27;s Cross having previously based in Howlands Farm at the top of Elvet Hill. The college body is diverse and comprised a community of scholars from over 100 nationalities.

Members of Ustinov College are termed &quot;Ustinovian&quot; and instead of a formal tutorial supervision, the college runs its own mentorship programme. Ustinov is the only college in Durham to offer boarding to families and partners of its students and pride itself in an egalitarian and modern approach to collegiate life. The college has no regular formal halls nor does it require its members to don their gowns. It is also unique, by virtue of having a graduate-only community, in having a Graduate Common Room.

==History==
In 1965, William Bayne Fisher, a professor in Durham University&#x27;s geography department, founded the Graduate Society and in its inaugural year, the total membership was 94 students: 86 men and 8 women. As more than 50% of its members lived in private accommodation, it retained its status as a society for over 35 years. In this time, the society acquired more accommodation: the Parsons field site off Old Elvet consisted of Fisher House, the Parsons Field House, Fonteyn Court and the Parsons Field Court; Palatine House; Kepier House and Kepier Court, both at the top of Claypath; 29, 34 and 38 on Old Elvet and Shincliffe Hall in Shincliffe Village.

The society&#x27;s accommodation has since then been gradually consolidated with the building of new accommodation at Howlands Farm in 1998, and on Dryburn Road in 2005. Since 1965, membership has increased to over 1500 and in 2003, the society was turned into a college and named in honour of the Chancellor of the University (1992–2004), Sir Peter Ustinov. The college&#x27;s offices were moved from Old Elvet to the Howlands Farm site in September 2005. The college motto (&quot;Diversitate Valemus&quot;) was coined later that year by Zu&#x27;bi Al-Zu&#x27;bi, President of the GCR.

The Parson&#x27;s Field site at the end of Old Elvet, which had been the heart of the community during its years as the Graduate Society, was handed over to St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society in 2005 and Palatine house was transferred to Hatfield College in 2006.

In 2017, Ustinov College moved from Howlands Farm to Sheraton Park, originally built for Neville&#x27;s Cross College in 1921 and vacated in 2004.

==Membership==
While Durham&#x27;s other colleges accept postgraduates, Ustinov College admits them exclusively, and is less formal in its structure than the other colleges. There are reported to be over 100 nationalities represented in Ustinov College, including members from Thailand, Greece, the United States, Jordan and Nigeria.

==Graduate Common Room==
The Graduate Common Room (GCR) is the student community of Ustinov College and all student members of the college, whether living in or out, are eligible for membership. Historically, the postgraduate community (through its elected representatives, the House Committee) had a high degree of autonomy from college officers and was self-governing in many matters. Today, the GCR committee, made up of elected house representatives officers, represent students&#x27; views in meetings with the college officers. The GCR committee also organises many student social events such as regular formal dinners, parties, the annual Summer Ball and Ustinov Summer Barbecue. As well as this, the GCR oversees many clubs and societies within the college. The first college formal was held in late 2006.

==Ustinov Boat Club==

Ustinov Boat Club (UBC) is the rowing club for Ustinov College. 

The club was formed in 1974 as the &quot;Graduate Society Boat Club&quot; (GSBC) but in 2004, the boat club applied to British Rowing (then the Amateur Rowing Association) to officially change its name to Ustinov Boat Club (UBC). The name change was considered necessary in order to reflect the college name change from the Graduate Society to Ustinov College. GSBC officially became UBC on Tuesday the 9th of November 2004. 

UBC is located at Dunelm House, alongside Grey College Boat Club and Butler College Boat Club, on the River Wear between Kingsgate Bridge and Elvet Bridge. UBC colours are white with black edges. 

The club has had periods of low membership, and British Rowing membership has lapsed, and then the club has reformed.

==Academic community==

Ustinov College is home to an academic community which enables students from departments across the university to engage each other in interdisciplinary dialogue. Current projects in Ustinov&#x27;s academic community are the Cafe des Arts, Cafe Politique, Cafe Scientifique, Ustinov Seminar, and the Ustinov Intercultural Forum (UIF). In addition to this, a college scholarship is awarded in support of the Race, Crime and Justice Research Group, which connects academics from across the north east of England.

<doc id="916874" wikidata="Q543545" url="?curid=916874" title="Arthur Lee (musician)">
<text>Arthur Taylor Lee (born Arthur Porter Taylor; March 7, 1945 – August 3, 2006) was an American musician, singer and songwriter who rose to fame as the leader of the Los Angeles rock band Love. Love&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Forever Changes&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and it is part of the National Recording Registry.

==Early life==
Lee was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 7, 1945, in John Gaston Hospital, to Agnes (née Porter), a school teacher, and Chester Taylor, a local jazz musician and cornet player. As an only child, Lee was known by the nickname &quot;Po&quot;, short for Porter, and was looked after by additional family members so his mother could proceed with her teaching career. With his father being his first connection with a musician, Lee was fascinated by music at a young age. He would sing and hum along to blues musicians such as Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters on the radio. At the age of four, Lee made his debut on the stage at a Baptist church, reciting a small poem about a red telephone.

In the early 1950s, his parents separated as his father &quot;refused or neglected to provide for her&quot;, the divorce petition states. Lee only remembered seeing his father three times during his entire life. Subsequently, Lee and his mother packed their things and took a train to California, while his father was at work. Lee and his mother resided in Los Angeles permanently in 1952. In 1953, their divorce was granted and his mother married Clinton Lee, a successful construction worker, on April 23, 1955. Lee was formally adopted by Clinton Lee on June 6, 1960, legally acquiring his surname, after filing for an adoption notice in 1958. His mother was able to resume her teaching career, enabling the family to buy a new home in the West Adams area of South Central Los Angeles. The neighborhood was also home to Johnny Echols, who attended the same schools as Lee and would later be the lead guitarist for Love.

Lee attended Sixth Avenue Elementary School and excelled in athletics but was behind academically. Being known as &quot;the toughest kid in the neighborhood&quot;, Lee was pressured into succeeding in school by his great aunt, a former school principal, but showed interest in sports, music, reading, and animals. Lee later attended Mount Vernon Junior High, where his interest in music would soon outweigh his focus on sports.

Lee&#x27;s first musical instrument was the accordion, which he took lessons in from a teacher. He adapted to reading music and developed a good ear and natural musical intelligence. While he was never formally taught about musical theory and composition, he was able to mimic musicians from records and compose his own songs. Eventually, he persuaded his parents to buy him an organ and harmonica. Graduating from Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Lee&#x27;s musical ambitions found opportunities between his local community and classmates. As opposed to attending a college under a sports scholarship, he strived for a musical career. His plan of forming a band was under the influence of Echols, after seeing him perform &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; with a five-piece band at a school assembly.

==Career==
===Pre-Love===
His first known recording is from 1963. &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; (Capitol Records 4980) was released by his first band, the instrumental outfit called The LAGs, a Booker T &amp; The MG&#x27;s type of unit which included Johnny Echols (future co-founder, guitarist, and vocalist of Love), Lee (organ), Allan Talbert (saxophone), and Roland Davis (drums).

As a songwriter, Lee composed the surf songs &quot;White Caps&quot; and &quot;Ski Surfin&#x27; Sanctuary&quot;. &quot;My Diary&quot; is the first Lee composition that came near to being a hit. It was written when Arthur was a teenager, about his teenage sweetheart Anita Billings. Later it was the R&amp;B singer Rosa Lee Brooks who performed and recorded it for Revis Records. This recording included Jimi Hendrix on electric guitar. In a 2005 interview, Lee stated that he was looking for a guitarist with a Curtis Mayfield–like feel, and Hendrix was recommended for the session by label owner Billy Revis.

Lee wrote &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Tryin for Little Ray. &quot;Luci Baines&quot;, a song about President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s daughter, was performed and recorded with Lee&#x27;s new band, The American Four. He composed &quot;Everybody Jerk&quot; and &quot;Slow Jerk&quot; for Ronnie and the Pomona Casuals, a band that put out an LP on the Donna label featuring some vocals by Lee. These early recordings are very rare but have been collected on a 1997 bootleg CD. The American Four however have since been reissued as a 45 and are also available now on iTunes.

===Love===
Lee said when he first heard The Byrds he felt vindicated since he&#x27;d already been writing music that had a similar folk rock sound. In 1965, the Grass Roots, his folk rock unit, changed their name to Love because there was already a signed act called The Grass Roots.

Lee&#x27;s early appearances were at clubs in Hollywood, including the Brave New World; Hullabaloo; Bido Lito&#x27;s; and the Sea Witch. At Bido Lito&#x27;s, a tiny hole-in-the-wall club located on a cul-de-sac known as Cosmo&#x27;s Alley, Lee first showed his potential for excellence. The Bido Lito&#x27;s audience was sometimes dotted with celebrities, including actor Sal Mineo, and rock stars Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, Bob Dylan, and Jimi Hendrix, who would go on to collaborate with Lee on future recording projects. Lee then got the opportunity to play the larger Whisky a Go Go on Los Angeles&#x27; Sunset Strip, after which Love received a recording contract by Elektra Records. Love received a lot of air play in Los Angeles, and performed several times in 1967 at the Cheetah nightclub in Venice, California.

Love&#x27;s music has been described as a mixture of folk-rock, psychedelic rock, baroque pop, Spanish-tinged pop, R&amp;B, garage rock, and even protopunk. Lee has been regarded as &quot;the first punk rocker&quot; but wasn&#x27;t flattered by the phrase as he thought the term punk meant &quot;being somebody&#x27;s bitch or something like that.&quot; Though Lee&#x27;s vocals have garnered some comparisons to Johnny Mathis, his lyrics often dwell on matters dark and vexing, but often with a wry humor. The group&#x27;s cover of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David composition &quot;My Little Red Book&quot; (first recorded by Manfred Mann for the soundtrack of &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;) received a thumbs-down from Bacharach: Love had altered the song&#x27;s chord changes. Nonetheless, the record was a Southern California hit and won Lee and Love a spot on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.

&quot;Love&quot; (1966) included their cover of &quot;My Little Red Book&quot;. &quot;Emotions&quot;, an instrumental track from the album, is used in the opening credits of the 1969 movie &quot;Medium Cool&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Da Capo&quot; (1966), featured just one song, &quot;Revelation&quot; on side two. The first side contained six individual songs, including their only single to achieve any success in the Billboard Top 40 chart: &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot;. Da Capo has been described as Jazz-Rock (or Jazz Fusion with its inclusion of flute and saxophone.) &quot;Forever Changes&quot; (1967) followed, the album a centerpiece of the group&#x27;s psychedelic-tinged sound, bolstered by David Angel&#x27;s orchestral arrangements. &quot;Forever Changes&quot; sold moderately in its time (reaching #154 on the Top 200 albums, and stayed on the charts for 10 weeks, without the benefit of a hit single), although it reached the top 30 in the UK. Nonetheless, its cult status grew.

After &quot;Forever Changes&quot;, the band managed to record one more non-album single (&quot;Your Mind and We Belong Together&quot; b/w &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;) which was released in June 1968 and failed to chart. Love then dissolved due to drug and money issues, only to have Lee revive the group name shortly thereafter. The new Love featured a lineup consisting of Lee on vocals and guitar, Jay Donnellan on guitar, Frank Fayad on bass, and George Suranovich on drums despite a few tracks featuring The Crazy World of Arthur Brown drummer Drachen Theaker. Lee signed a record deal with Bob Krasnow&#x27;s Blue Thumb label during this time, but without mentioning to Krasnow that he was technically still signed to Elektra Records. Lee had wanted out of his Elektra deal since 1966 (the year the self-titled debut was released).

Elektra founder Jac Holzman did not want to let Lee out of his contract as he admired his talents but he also did not want to keep an artist under contract who did not want to stay, so a deal was worked out that allowed Lee to record for Blue Thumb with Holzman getting his choice of ten of the resulting songs to fulfill the Elektra contract of a fourth album. That album would become &quot;Four Sail&quot; (1969), Lee&#x27;s pun on his original title &quot;For Sale&quot;. A mere three months after the release of &quot;Four Sail&quot;, Blue Thumb records released their Love album, &quot;Out Here&quot;, using remaining tracks from the sessions.

&quot;Out Here&quot; featured the same musicians as &quot;Four Sail&quot; with the addition of Gary Rowles, who played on one track. Lee felt that Donnellan was getting a little too egotistical for his tastes. The new lineup consisted of musicians who were not fans of &quot;Forever Changes&quot;, resulting in a harder-edged rock sound. During the initial &quot;Four Sail/Out Here&quot; sessions, Krasnow approached Lee about the possibility of rounding up the original members of Love. Krasnow felt there was some magic missing with the new line up. Lee obliged him, and started rehearsing and even recording some with original members Echols, Forssi, and Stuart (MacLean had turned him down).

Heroin proved to be too dominant in the lives of Echols and Forssi. Both men were constantly pawning off the rented equipment for drug money and were eventually let go yet again. Love also toured both &quot;Four Sail&quot; and &quot;Out Here&quot; for their first trip to Europe, where they were always more popular, and went on to do a nationally televised performance on Dutch television which also featured promotional videos for older songs from the Elektra years. &quot;Out Here&quot; managed to chart at #29 in the UK in May 1970.

The next album to appear from Love was &quot;False Start&quot; (1970) which continued on with the heavier sonic direction of acid rock, in addition to featuring elements of classic R&amp;B. One new member was added to this incarnation of Love, a vocalist/guitarist named Nooney Rickett. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;The Everlasting First&quot;, features Jimi Hendrix on guitar.

Lee met Hendrix while in England, and they decided to record at Bob Krasnow&#x27;s expense. For years there were rumors that Arthur and Jimi recorded an entire record together, but the truth surfaced in 2009 when an acetate from Blue Thumb made rounds and it was revealed that there was only a long jam session (titled &quot;Jam&quot; on the actual acetate, to accompany &quot;The Everlasting First&quot; and an early version of the Hendrix song &quot;Ezy Rider&quot;). According to legend, Arthur overheard Bob Krasnow telling someone that if the &quot;False Start&quot; album did not crack the top 10 he was going to release the band from its contract. Moreover, Arthur made Krasnow give him that in writing. The album did not even reach the top 200 on the Billboard charts.

In 1971, Lee was signed to Columbia Records and spent the better part of the summer recording; all of the songs were deemed unworthy of issue (the entire Columbia project, along with a handful of demos, was released for the first time in 2009 on Sundazed Music as &quot;Love Lost&quot;).

===Solo career===

In July 1972, Lee released his first solo album, &quot;Vindicator&quot;, on A&amp;M Records, featuring a new group of musicians also playing as the band Love. At one point in time they would use the name Bandaid, a name originally suggested by Jimi Hendrix for a briefly considered lineup of himself, Lee, and Steve Winwood. This album failed to chart. Lee recorded a second solo album in 1973 entitled &quot;Black Beauty&quot; for Buffalo Records, but the label folded before the album was released. Lee contributed the title track to the 1974 blaxploitation film &quot;Thomasine &amp; Bushrod&quot;. Lee&#x27;s next move was to credit the backing group for &quot;Black Beauty&quot; with the addition of guitarist John Sterling as a new Love for &quot;Reel to Real&quot; (1974).

A new Lee solo album, called just &quot;Arthur Lee&quot;, appeared on Rhino Records in 1981, featuring covers of The Bobbettes&#x27; &quot;Mr. Lee&quot; and Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; and musicians Sterling (guitar), George Suranovich (drums), and Kim Kesterson (bass), as well as some of the members from &quot;Reel to Real&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, there were various attempts to reunite the original Love lineup. At the suggestion of guitarist John Sterling who first joined Arthur for &quot;Reel To Real&quot;, one such show from the Whisky in October 1978 was recorded by Sterling on cassette. It featuring Lee and Bryan MacLean with Sterling (guitar), George Suranovich (drums), and Kim Kesterson (bass), and was released on Rhino as a live album picture disc entitled &quot;Love Live&quot; (1980) on Rhino Records. In 1982, MCA released &quot;Studio/Live&quot;, which was a collection of tracks from the early 1970s incarnation of Love coordinated by rock lawyer/journalist Stann Findelle, including never before heard tracks recorded from Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore East.

Apart from the &quot;Studio/Live&quot; package on MCA, the 1980s were a mostly fallow period for Lee. According to him: &quot;I was gone for a decade. I went back to my old neighborhood to take care of my father, who was dying of cancer. I was tired of signing autographs. I was tired of being BS&#x27;d out of my money...I just got tired.&quot; Alice Cooper did record a cover version of Lee&#x27;s &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot; on a 1981 album, &quot;Special Forces&quot;.

Lee re-emerged musically in 1992 with a new album entitled &quot;Arthur Lee &amp; Love -{Five String Serenade}&quot; on the French New Rose label. The title track, &quot;Five String Serenade&quot;, was later recorded by Mazzy Star and Jack White of The White Stripes. The album also featured a new artist he discovered from San Francisco, Keith Farrish aka Demian X Diamond. He performed live around this time in Paris, London, and Liverpool. In 1993 he played shows in New York and England. The following year he released a 45rpm single, &quot;Girl on Fire&quot; backed with &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;, on Distortions Records. He began to tour regularly with a backup band comprising former members of Das Damen, and LA group Baby Lemonade. In 1995, Rhino Records released the compilation &quot;Love Story&quot;. The album was a two-disc set with extensive liner notes that chronicled the period of 1966–1972.

==Later years and death==
===Prison===
In late 1996, Lee was sentenced to 12 years for the negligent discharge of a firearm. California&#x27;s three strikes law meant Lee was forced to serve a prison term, having previously served two years in jail for arson, and having been charged with various drug, driving and assault offenses.

Lee denied that he had fired the gun, and visiting fan Doug Thomas who had denied involvement when the police responded later confessed to the deed. A year-delayed analysis of a gunpowder residue test conducted on Lee produced a negative result. Had he pleaded guilty, Lee would have been sentenced to nine months in jail; instead, he chose a jury trial and was convicted. His sentence was pronounced at 12 years in prison.

While in prison Lee refused visitors and interviews. &quot;I thought I would beat this case, so why would I want to broadcast it? This has been so humiliating to me.&quot;

Former bandmates Bryan MacLean and Ken Forssi both died while Lee was incarcerated, ending any speculation as to a full-fledged Love reunion.

On December 12, 2001, Lee was released from prison, having served five years and six months of his original sentence. With the trial prosecutor having been found guilty of misconduct, a federal appeals court in California reversed the charge of negligent discharge of a firearm.

===Last years===
Following Lee&#x27;s release from prison, he put together a new incarnation of Love and planned a &quot;Forever Changes&quot; 35th Anniversary Tour, to kick off at the Royal Festival Hall in London. The Make-Up released a song calling for Arthur Lee&#x27;s release, called &quot;Free Arthur Lee&quot;.

Three Love tracks, &quot;My Little Red Book&quot; (from &quot;Love&quot;) as well as &quot;Always See Your Face&quot; and &quot;Your Friend and Mine&quot; (both from &quot;Four Sail&quot;), were included on the soundtrack for the film adaptation of Nick Hornby&#x27;s &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. Lee&#x27;s songs have been heard in other films as well, notably &quot;7 &amp; 7 Is&quot; in both 1990&#x27;s &quot;Point Break&quot; and 1996&#x27;s &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;.

In 2002, Lee began touring in earnest under the name &quot;Love with Arthur Lee&quot;. He performed throughout Europe, North America, and Australia. This incarnation of Love was composed of the members of the band Baby Lemonade, who had first performed with Lee in May 1993 at Raji&#x27;s. The band began performing the &quot;Forever Changes&quot; album in its entirety, often with a string and horn section. A live CD and DVD of this material was released in 2003.

Johnny Echols joined the new group for a special &quot;Forever Changes&quot; 35th Anniversary Tour performance at Royce Hall, UCLA, in the spring of 2003. Lee and the band continued to tour throughout 2003 and 2004, including many concerts in and around hometown Los Angeles, notably a show at the outdoor Sunset Junction Street Fair, the San Diego Street Scene, and a headlining date with The Zombies at the Ebell Theatre. Echols occasionally joined Lee and the group on the continuing and final tours of 2004 to 2005. They played a well received date at the Fillmore in San Francisco with the full string and horn section. 
At this time, Lee had been diagnosed with (acute myeloid leukemia). Choosing not to reveal his illness to the band, Lee announced that he would not be able to participate in the final tour in July 2005. Since no one in the band knew the basis of his absence, Lee&#x27;s decision to forgo the final tour was met with mixed reactions. The remaining members of the band, along with Echols, continued to perform at the venues of the last tour (July 2005) without Lee, under the name The Love Band. At the end of September 2005, Lee moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he planned to continue to make music using the name Love. Joining him was to be drummer Greg Roberson (Reigning Sound, Her Majesty&#x27;s Buzz, Compulsive Gamblers) to put together a new line-up in Memphis, which was to include Adam Woodard, Alex Greene (The Reigning Sound, Big Ass Truck), Jack &quot;Oblivian&quot; Yarber, Alicja Trout, and Johnny Echols from the original Love line-up. Ultimately Arthur&#x27;s ill health prevented this from happening.

In April 2006, it was publicly announced that Lee was ill. A tribute fund was set up shortly after the announcement, with a series of benefit concerts to be performed to help pay medical bills. The most notable of these concerts was produced by Steve Weitzman of SW Productions at New York&#x27;s Beacon Theatre on June 23, 2006, and featured Robert Plant, Ian Hunter, Ryan Adams, Nils Lofgren, Yo La Tengo, Garland Jeffreys, Johnny Echols (Love&#x27;s original lead guitarist), and Flashy Python &amp; The Body Snatchers (featuring Alec Ounsworth of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah). Backed by Ian Hunter&#x27;s band, Plant performed 12 songs, including four Led Zeppelin songs and five recorded by Love in the 1960s (&quot;7 and 7 Is&quot;, &quot;A House Is Not A Motel&quot;, &quot;Bummer in the Summer&quot;, &quot;Old Man&quot;, and &quot;Hey Joe&quot;). A benefit concert was held in Dublin, Ireland.

===Death===
Lee underwent several months of treatment for leukemia, to include chemotherapy and an experimental stem cell transplant using stem cells from an umbilical cord blood donor. Despite treatment, his condition continued to worsen, and he died from complications of leukemia in Memphis, Tennessee, on August 3, 2006, at the age of 61.

==Legacy==
Barclay James Harvest&#x27;s song a &quot;A tale of Two Sixties&quot; from the 1978 album &quot;XII&quot; contains the lines &quot;Give me the sound of Arthur Lee, with Forever Changes I remember, &quot;andmoreagain &quot;, don&#x27;t leave me ever.&quot;

Robyn Hitchcock&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;The Wreck of the Arthur Lee&quot; from the Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians album &quot;Respect&quot; was written as a tribute to the singer.

Arthur Lee is mentioned in the song &quot;Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken&quot;, by Lloyd Cole &amp; the Commotions, as well as in the song &quot;Mate of the Bloke&quot;, by Half Man Half Biscuit. His prison term is the subject of &quot;The Prison&#x27;s Going Down&quot; by ex-Stranglers singer and guitarist Hugh Cornwell. Lee is the subject of the song &quot;Byrds Turn to Stone&quot; (originally titled &quot;Mr Lee&quot;) by Liverpool band (and former Arthur Lee backing group) Shack.

Rival Schools and Quicksand frontman Walter Schreifels paid tribute to Arthur Lee on his 2010 solo album &quot;An Open Letter to the Scene&quot; with a track titled &quot;Arthur Lee&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;.

The 2009 &quot;Communion&quot; album by the Swedish band The Soundtrack of Our Lives features a song entitled &quot;The Fan Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; which was based on a conversation singer Ebbot Lundberg had with Lee.

Directors Mike Kerry and Chris Hall managed to persuade Arthur Lee to cooperate in the making of a UK documentary film &quot;Love Story&quot; (2006), successfully recording the last interviews with a reflective Arthur Lee, before he was diagnosed with leukemia. The film shows interviews with key individuals from some of the line-ups of Love and Elektra management and studio engineers.

Rapper Mac Miller covered Lee&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gotta Live&quot; on his posthumous sixth studio album &quot;Circles&quot; (2020), on the song &quot;Everybody.&quot;

Lee&#x27;s composition &quot;Signed D. C.&quot; was about heroin addiction and written as a tribute to Love&#x27;s drummer Don Conka. It has been covered by a multitude of artists such as The Rising Storm (1983), Shockabilly (1984), Grant Hart, which appears on his &quot;All of My Senses&quot; EP (1992), The White Stripes which was recorded in 1997 and released in 2011 on a single. Bluesman Michael Powers included it on his &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; album which was released in 2007.

Russian psychedelic/punk rock band Grazhdanskaya Oborona dedicated their last album Zachem snyatsya sny? (English: Why Do We Have Dreams?) to the memory of Arthur Lee.

In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Forever Changes&quot; 40th in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008. It was entered into the National Recording Registry in May 2012.

<text>Inge the Elder (Swedish: &quot;Inge Stenkilsson&quot;; Old Norse: &quot;Ingi Steinkelsson&quot;; died c. 1105–1110) was a king of Sweden. In English literature he has also been called &quot;Ingold&quot;. While scant sources do not allow a full picture of his term of kingship, he is known to have led a turbulent but at length successful reign of more than two decades. He stands out as a devout Christian who founded the first abbey in Sweden and acted harshly against pagan practices. The kingdom was still an unstable realm based on alliances of noblemen, and Inge&#x27;s main power base was in Västergötland and Östergötland; one of the earliest chronicles that mention his reign knows him as &quot;rex gautorum&quot;, king of the Geats.

==Biography==
Inge was the son of the former King Stenkil and a Swedish princess. Inge shared the rule of the kingdom with his probably elder brother Halsten Stenkilsson, but little is known with certainty of Inge&#x27;s reign. According to the contemporary chronicler Adam of Bremen and the writer of his scholion, the former king Stenkil had died and two kings named Eric had ruled and been killed. Then an Anund Gårdske was summoned from Kievan Rus&#x27;, but rejected due to his refusal to administer the blóts at the Temple at Uppsala. A hypothesis suggests that Anund and Inge were the same person, as several sources mention Inge as a fervent Christian. All that can be said is that a Håkan the Red ruled in c. 1075 (when Adam concluded his chronicle) and that Inge was enthroned under unknown circumstances shortly before 1080.

In a letter to Inge from Pope Gregory VII, from 1080, he is called &quot;king of the Swedes&quot;, but in a later letter probably dated to 1081, to Inge and another king &quot;A&quot; (either his brother Halsten or Håkan the Red), they are called kings of the West Geats. Whether this difference reflects a change in territory is not certain since the two letters concern the spreading of Christianity in Sweden and the paying of tithe to the Pope.

=== Rise of Blot-Sweyn and the expulsion of Inge ===

In perhaps the early 1080s, Inge was forced to abdicate by the Swedes over his disrespect for old traditions and his refusal to administer the pagan custom of the blót. Blot-Sweyn (Swain the Sacrifier) was thus elected king. The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; describes the rise of Sweyn, the abdication and how Inge was exiled in Västergötland:

However, Inge returned after three winters to kill Blot-Sweyn and reclaim the throne:

A similar story also appears in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, but in this account, Sweyn stays indoors and is burnt to death:
In Västergötland, Inge lived, according to later tradition, at Bjurum near present-day Falköping. An Icelandic skald named Markús Skeggjason was one of his court poets, according to &quot;Skáldatal&quot;. Markús was later the lawspeaker of Iceland from 1084. It has been suggested that the details about Inge and Blot-Sweyn in the Norse literature are derived from him. In that case Blot-Sweyn&#x27;s short reign would fall in the early years of the 1080s.

According to the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;, Inge ruled Sweden with virility and he never broke the laws that had been accepted in the districts.

=== Later years ===

Around 1100, Inge and Queen Helena founded Vreta Abbey near present-day Linköping in Östergötland. The abbey housed Sweden&#x27;s first nunnery and is one of the oldest in Scandinavia. The abbey belonged to the Benedictine order and was founded on the orders of Pope Paschal II. As a step in the preparation of a Nordic archbishopric in Lund in Denmark, a list of Swedish sees and provinces was drawn up in c. 1100 which gives an idea about Inge&#x27;s realm. The sees (&quot;Nomina ciuitatum in suethia&quot;) are given as Scara, Lionga, Kaupinga, Tuna, Strigin, Sigituna, and Arosa. Of these, Scara and Sigituna are easily identified as Skara and Sigtuna; these are also mentioned by Adam of Bremen as seats for bishops. Lionga and Strigin are probably Linköping and Strängnäs, while the others are harder to identify. These might have been places with a substantial Christian population, rather than stable administrative units. Meanwhile, the provinces or &quot;islands&quot; (&quot;Nomina insularum, de regno sueuorum&quot;) are Gothica australis (Östergötland), Gothica occidentalis (Västergötland), Guasmannia (Västmanland), Sundermannia (Södermanland), Nerh (Närke), Tindia (Tiundaland), Fedundria (Fjädrundaland), Atanht (Attundaland), Guthlandia (Gotland), Guarandia (Värend), Findia (Finland or Finnveden), Hestia (Estonia), Helsingia (Helsingland), Guarmelande (Värmland), and Teuste (Tjust). The inclusion of Estonia, and possibly Finland, may point to missionary influences or ambitions, rather than indicating that these areas belonged to Inge&#x27;s kingdom. It is, nevertheless, known that Inge married one of his daughters to a Prince of Novgorod, pointing at an active dynastic policy directed to the east.

About this time Inge and the Norwegian king Magnus Barefoot were at war, since Magnus coveted the province Dalsland. A Norwegian fortification was built at Kållandsö in Lake Vänern. However, Inge marched a strong army over the ice in the winter, and forced the garrison to surrender. Some time later Magnus invaded western Sweden with fresh troops, but was attacked by Inge at Fuxarne. The Geats drove the Norwegian army from the field and Magnus barely escaped with his life. However, in 1101 the war came to an end with a peace agreement concluded at Kungahälla together with king Eric Evergood of Denmark. Eric had spent time in exile in Sweden before his enthronement, and therefore probably had good relations with the House of Stenkil. At this meeting Inge gave his daughter Margareta as wife to king Magnus, with Dalsland as dowry. In Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Magnus Barefoot&#x27;s Saga&quot;, a part of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, there is a description of the appearance of Inge:

=== Death ===

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; tells that Inge died of old age and that he ruled until his death. The exact date of his death is not known, but his successor Philip (d. 1118) is said to have ruled &quot;briefly&quot;. Since the province of Jämtland went over to the Norwegian king in 1111, it might mean that the forceful Inge was dead by the time, and that his weak successors were unable to maintain his realm. He may therefore have died around 1110. According to later local tradition, Inge was originally buried in a small church at Bjurum, but his remains were later moved to another location. There is also a gravestone for him in a deserted churchyard at Hånger and a special cenotaph among other royal grave chapels at Varnhem Abbey. Inge&#x27;s actual grave is most likely a set of remains found in Vreta Abbey in a section of the abbey church that was erected by Inge&#x27;s son Ragnvald. All skeletons that are likely to be that of Inge are very tall, about two meters in length, suggesting that Snorri&#x27;s description was accurate.

==Family==
King Inge was married to Helena. Together with Helena, Inge founded the monastery of Vreta. Inge&#x27;s son, Ragnvald, died before he could succeed his father on the throne. Inge was succeeded by his two nephews, Philip and Inge the Younger, who were the sons of his elder brother King Halsten Stenkilsson.

King Inge and Queen Helena were the parents of four children:
*Christina, married Prince Mstislav I of Novgorod, later Grand Duke of Kiev.
*Ragnvald, father of Ingrid Ragnvaldsdotter. It has been suggested by historian Sven Tunberg that this Ragnvald is identical with Ragnvald Knaphövde.&quot; 
*Margaret Fredkulla, married King Magnus Barefoot of Norway, and later King Niels of Denmark
*Katarina, married Danish Prince Björn Ironside Haraldsson

<text>Nepean Creek Park is a linear watershed park, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Greenbelt master plan of the National Capital Commission.

It runs East-West along North Colonnade Road for more than a kilometre.

The park is located about two kilometres South of Hog&#x27;s Back Falls.

==Features==
It offers many soccer fields, and a long bike path, but it is mostly a nature preserve filled with wild animals and vegetation. Ducks often winter in its ponds instead of heading South. The creek empties itself near the eastern end of the park by crossing under Prince of Wales Drive and entering the Rideau River.</text><links>

<doc id="916879" wikidata="Q2865204" url="?curid=916879" title="Arthur Lee (diplomat)">
<text>Arthur Lee (20 December 1740 – 12 December 1792) was an American physician, diplomat and abolitionist who was born in the British colony of Virginia. He helped negotiate and signed the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, along with Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane, which allied France and the United States in fighting the war. 

Lee was educated in medicine and law at the University of Edinburgh and in London, respectively. After passing the bar, he practiced law in London for several years. He stayed in London during the Revolutionary War, representing the colonies to Britain and France and also serving as an American spy to track their activities. After his return to Virginia, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.

==Life==
Born at Stratford Hall, Virginia, Arthur Lee was the youngest son of Hon. Thomas Lee (1690–1750) and Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701–1750). Three of his five surviving elder brothers, Richard Henry Lee (1732–1794), Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734–1797) and William Lee (1739–1795), also became Revolutionary-era diplomats.

He attended Eton College in England and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated in 1764. The title description of his thesis is: Dissertatio medica inauguralis, de cortice peruviano: quam ... ex auctoritate ... Gulielmi Robertson ... Academiae Edinburgenae praefecti ... pro gradu doctoratus ... eruditorum examini subjicit, Arthur Lee, Virginiensis. Ad diem septembris [1764] ... – Edinburgi : in aedibus A. Donaldson et J. Reid, MDCCLXIV. – 2 p. l., 47 p. ; 20 cm. on 13 May 1765 he matriculated at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.

During the latter period, Lee wrote in 1764, &quot;An Essay in Vindication of the Continental Colonies of America,&quot; one of his more noted works. He opposed the Townshend Acts and became a major proponent of American resistance to the British. After this work, he was granted membership to the American Philosophical Society through his election in 1768.

He studied law in London, passing the bar, and practising there from 1770 to 1776. During this time in London, Lee wrote many influential pamphlets and essays opposing slavery and British continental policies. He lived at Poland Street with Paul Wentworth (counsellor) for five years.

In 1770, Lee in London was named as the Massachusetts correspondent to Britain and France. He began corresponding with Samuel Adams, which began a long friendship. They probably did not meet personally until sometime after 1780. Lee met Benjamin Franklin while he was in London, where Franklin was negotiating on behalf of Pennsylvania interests. Lee criticized Franklin&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle and told Sam Adams he would never be a good negotiator between a free people and a tyrant.

In May 1776, he was a guest at the dinner organized by publisher Charles Dilly that—at the urging of James Boswell—brought together Samuel Johnson, an ardent opponent of the American colonists&#x27; cause, and John Wilkes, one of its most prominent British supporters. 
During the American Revolution, the Continental Congress appointed Lee as its envoy to Spain and Prussia, but his success was at best mixed. 

In November 1775, the committee of secret correspondence of the Second Continental Congress asked Lee to become its confidential correspondent in London, where during his diplomatic career he frequently aired suspicions upon the various men who had appointed him along with some of his colleges. Arguably Lee was one of America&#x27;s first spies. He gathered information in France and Britain. He also successfully identified Edward Bancroft, secretary to the American legation in Paris, as a British spy.

Later, in Paris, after Lee helped negotiate the Treaty of Alliance (1778) with France, he fell out with Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane. He persuaded Congress to recall Deane to America, but he was himself recalled soon afterward. He earned a reputation of being overly suspicious where, Franklin, in a letter of April 3, 1778 chided him that if he let these feelings dominate his life that he would end up insane.

After Lee returned to Virginia, the state in 1782 sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. The same year he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He unsuccessfully ran as the Anti-Administration candidate for Virginia&#x27;s 4th congressional district in 1790, losing to incumbent Richard Bland Lee, a distant relative. He was also a candidate in the October 1792 special election for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Richard Henry Lee, another distant relative, but he lost to John Taylor of Caroline.

In 1790, Arthur Lee purchased Lansdowne from Robert Wormeley III. This fine mansion still stands in Urbanna, a small waterfront town on Virginia&#x27;s Middle Peninsula. It is presently a private residence. Lee died at Urbanna in 1792 and was buried in the rear garden with no stone. He never married and had no children. Plans to reinter him at Stratford Hall never came about. Lansdowne was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

==Ancestry==

Arthur Lee was the son of Colonel Thomas Lee, Hon. (1690–1750) of Stratford Hall Plantation, Westmoreland County, Virginia. Thomas married Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701–1750), the daughter of Colonel Philip Ludwell II (1672–1726) of Green Spring Plantation, and Hannah Harrison (1679–1731).

Arthur&#x27;s father, Thomas, was the son of Colonel Richard Lee II, Esq., known as &quot;Richard the Scholar&quot; (1647–1715) and Laetitia Corbin (c. 1657 – 1706). Richard Lee II, was the son of Col. Richard Lee I, Esq., known as &quot;The Immigrant&quot; (1618–1664) and Anne Constable (c. 1621 – 1666).

Arthur&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Laetitia, was the daughter of the Lees&#x27; neighbor and councillor (attorney), Hon. Henry Corbin, Sr. (1629–1676) and Alice (Eltonhead) Burnham (c. 1627 – 1684).

Arthur&#x27;s paternal great-grandmother, Anne, was the daughter of Thomas Constable; she became a ward of Sir John Thoroughgood.

<text>Van Mildert College (colloquially known as Van Mil or Mildert) is one of the 17 constituent colleges of Durham University. The college was founded in 1965 and takes its name from William Van Mildert, the last Prince-Bishop to rule the County Palatine of Durham and a leading figure in the university&#x27;s foundation. Originally an all-male college, Van Mildert admitted female undergraduates for the first time in 1972, making it the first Durham college to become mixed.

The college occupies grounds of alongside South Road and Mill Hill Lane, about south of the university town, and is centred on a small lake. Designed by Middleton, Fletcher &amp; Partners, the college was built in a modernist and egalitarian architectural style that aimed to house the sudden influx of students in the early 1960s. The college is notable for its lake, named Lake Mildert, and its Ann Dobson Dining Hall which is the largest student dining hall in Durham.

The college is the third largest collegiate body in the university by total numbers of affiliated students, just behind University College, and is reputed for its community feel and relative informality compared with other Durham colleges. Almost half of home students admitted are from grammar school and it is one of the 7 colleges of Durham that does not require its students to don their gown, though the traditional Durham custom of formal dining are still performed and taken pride of. 

Among Mildertian&#x27;s notable alumni are former Minister of State for Women The Baroness Morgan of Huyton, World Record triple jump Olympic champion Jonathan Edwards, the cosmologist and Templeton Prize winner John D. Barrow, English judge of the UK Supreme Court Lord Hughes of Ombersley, and Turkish Prince Naz Osmanoglu.

== History ==

Van Mildert College was established as a men&#x27;s college in 1965 following recommendations of the Robbins Report looking into the future of higher education in the UK. In 1963, King&#x27;s College in Newcastle declared itself independent from the University of Durham, meaning new colleges were required to meet the new university places that the Government wished to create. As a result, the university planned to establish three new colleges on Elvet Hill which went on to be named Collingwood College, Trevelyan College and Van Mildert College.
The college marks its foundation in 1965 when the first students were admitted, with the first college master, Dr Arthur Prowse, already been appointed in 1964. Initially, the college only accepted men, but during the college&#x27;s early years, it also temporarily accommodated (albeit not accepting them as members) of over 50 women from other colleges. Together with the first Senior Tutor, Arnold Bradshaw, Prowse established the participatory, liberal, and forward-looking culture that Van Mildert maintains to this day. In October 1965, the founder students took up residence in Parson&#x27;s Field House, though it was not long before the college moved to its permanent site on Elvet Hill by Michaelmas 1966. The College permanent site was designed by Middleton, Fletcher &amp; Partners of Middlesbrough, which features a small lake to accommodate the site&#x27;s tendency to become waterlogged. This lake, along with its flock of ducks, remains a distinctive feature of the college and the main College building, located next to the lake, included the Dining Hall and servery, a library, bar, common rooms, and offices. 

On 13 June 1967, the college was officially opened by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, who had previously served as Van Mildert Professor of Divinity at Durham and was a friend of Arthur Prowse. By this time, the college had reached its full capacity, with around 300 undergraduates, along with some graduate students and resident members of the Senior Common Room. This period also set the stage for Van Mildert to become mixed in the future.

=== 1970 to 1976: Pioneering for mixed-sex education ===

In 1970, the Governing Body of the College took decision to go mixed and to construct a new accommodation block, named Middleton Stairs after architect Philip Middleton. In those time as well that the college cooperated closely with Collingwood College, and housed their initial students while their buildings were being finished. The two college shared facilities, with two Masters, Dr Paul Kent and Mr Peter Bayley, presiding over at opposite ends of the Hall. The College admitted its first female students in 1967 reading for Certificates in Education, though undergraduate women were only formally welcomed in Michaelmas term 1972, with a few already transferring in 1971, making Van Mildert the first Durham college to go mixed.
The college&#x27;s population grew steadily, reaching 498 in 1976. Internal reorganisations expanded the library and bar, and additional accommodation was acquired. The 1986 opening of the Conference Centre provided new meeting rooms and boosted the college conference business. In 1990, the Tunstall Building added 30 single ensuite bedrooms, followed by the Deerness block in 2002 with 97 single ensuite rooms, allowing the college to house 515 students, including all first-years and some final-year and graduate students. By 2013, Van Mildert had grown to a community of over 1,000 students, staff, and tutors from around the world.

== Overview ==

=== Governance and legal status ===
Van Mildert is a maintained college, which are governed directly by, and are financially dependent on, the university. Van Mildert&#x27;s principals and staffs are appointed by University Council and are overseen by the Deputy Warden, who is also a member of the University Executive Committee, and so does not enjoy independence unlike most of Oxbridge colleges and Durham&#x27;s two other recognised colleges of St John&#x27;s and St Chad&#x27;s.

The college is headed by a Principal (previously titled Master until 1988), a vice-principal and a board of governors. Some members sits as governor by virtue of holding another office (&quot;ex officio&quot;):
* The Principal (chairman), 
* The Vice-Chancellor and Warden
* The Vice-Principal and Senior Tutor, 
* The Bursar
* The President of the Senior Common Room
* The Chaplain
* The President of the Middle Common Room
* The President of the Junior Common Room
College tutors and the Junior Common Room and a representative of the University Council also elects members to sit on the governing body.

As a constituent college of Durham University, Van Mildert College is recognised as a &quot;listed bodies&quot; in the Education (Listed Bodies) (England) Order 2013 made under the Education Reform Act 1988. The legal status of Van Mildert College is thus similar to those colleges in Oxford and Cambridge and the dissolution of the college will only take effect if approved by the Privy Council.

=== Buildings and grounds ===
The college and its main entrance are located at the eastern end of Mill Hill Lane, neighbouring South College and John Snow College to its west, Elvet Hill Road to its east and South Road to its south. The front of the college runs between St Aidan&#x27;s College, Teikyo University and the Oriental Museum, whilst the back entrance along Lake Mildert partly neighbours Collingwood College. Van Mildert building blocks are architecturally modernist, many of which are named after local rivers, which are Tyne, Tees, Derwent, Wear, and Deerness (postgraduates only). Two accommodation blocks are not named in this convention with Tunstall block named after a town in Sunderland and Middleton stairs named after the architect that conceptualised the college. Unlike the Bailey colleges where accommodation blocks are spread around the city, all of Van Mildert&#x27;s accommodation are situated within the college grounds, and the college is in the process of refurbishing each of the buildings in turn. In total the college can provide around 525 single rooms for its student members.

The post of college principal in Van Mildert College also comes with residential benefits, and that they are entitled to use and live in the Principal&#x27;s House (formerly Master&#x27;s House) which are located by South Road neighbouring Southend House. The college also owns a boat house by Kingsgate Footbridge and a tennis court. Tees Lawn, which are situated within the college grounds are often used by college members for recreational purposes.

In 2024, Van Mildert College was criticised for not being able to accommodate returning students into college accommodation for the academic year whilst still having at least 70 unoccupied beds (16% unoccupied) within the college grounds.

=== Ann Dobson Dining Hall ===

The college&#x27;s Dining Hall, the Ann Dobson Dining Hall (colloquially the &quot;Annie D&quot;), is the largest student dining hall in Durham, although some claimed that it is the largest in the UK and even in the whole of Europe, which is not true as Churchill College in Cambridge can cater for up to 430 guests in a formal dining arrangement. It measures 30.8m by 13.2m and can seat approximately 350 members at formal hall.
The dining hall is used for a variety of functions over the academic year and plays a central role in the lives of livers-in (a Durham term for students who lives in college) as it is where college meals and formals are held.

In the 1960s, members of the college often enjoyed concerts featuring well known artistes, such as Shura Cherkassky and Peter Pears, though this has not persisted. Today, the hall still acts as a venue for drama productions and as a sports hall for college members.
A copy of a portrait of William Van Mildert, whom the college is named after, hangs at one end of the dining hall, along with portraits of the former Principals and Masters of the college.

=== Libraries ===
The Bradshaw Room is the main library of Van Mildert College and is open 24 hours a day. It is equipped with over 12,000 books &amp; journals and, along with St John&#x27;s College Archives, is the only other College library in Durham to be listed in The National Archives. The Bradshaw Room also houses a Library2careers, study-skills section, and course-related DVDs, and it overlooks the Mildert Lake.

The Kent Room, which is located across the corridor from Bradshaw is also regularly used by college members and it contains most of the college fiction collections. It is also often used for study groups.

=== Mildert&#x27;s Inn ===

The Van Mildert College Bar (also known as Mildert&#x27;s Inn which few known) is a recently refurbished bar which are extensively used by both members of the college and students from other colleges. It is also generally used for holding JCR meetings during term time and in recent years has won the &#x27;University Bar&#x27; category of the &quot;Best Bar None&quot; and awards from Durham City for the 2008–09 and 2010–11 academic years. Most recently, Van Mildert&#x27;s Bar has also won the &#x27;Gold&#x27; category for the Best Bar None Awards for the year 2016–17. 

The Bar produces its own brand of ale called &#x27;Treasure in the Swamp&#x27; and serves other alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and/or alcohol alternatives. The bar is infamous for its college drink – ‘The Little Lad’ and ‘Shrek Juice’.

=== Lake Mildert and Tees Lawn ===
The lake is perhaps the most distinctive physical features of the college and is an integral part of the college&#x27;s identity and community, and a valuable environmental resources for a variety of plants and animals. In the not too distant past, it has been used as an ice rink by college members when the lake water froze in the winter, and rowing boats have traversed it at summer balls. There were also plans to convert the area nearest to Main College into an outdoor swimming pool, although this was not eventually realised. The lake has now toxic water warning and is out of bounds at all times, with transgression of the rule taken very seriously by the College Officers.

The college recorded at least 10 species of wildlife to be thriving within the college grounds, which includes the Grey Herons and the infamous species of Van Mildert ducks, the Mallards. Now an enviable haven for wildlife, the college grounds host a new cohort of ducklings every year and its water lilies around the lake provides sanctuary for a plethora of animals. The lake is aerated by the two fountains, which provide a home for various fish and plants.

Tees Lawn is a meadow situated between Tees, Wear and Derwent Block facing towards Lake Mildert. The lawn is used extensively by college members during the summer and it is used to host the annual college Michaelmas ball. A sculpture entitled &quot;The Mildert Feather&quot; was commissioned by Danish artist Erik Heide to mark the college 50th anniversary. The sculpture is mounted on a rotating base on the lawn, which is designed to move with the wind.

=== Other facilities ===
The college has other social facilities, including three music/recording suite, a gym, computer room, shop, tennis court and a full-size snooker table. Its music rooms also includes a drum kit, a keyboard, guitar amps, and a grand piano selected exclusively from Steinway &amp; Sons by former JCR President, Henry Bashford.

The Van Mildert&#x27;s Junior Common Room is used for many of the social events that are organised by the JCR, such as bops, ents after Formals, band nights and amateur theatre productions. Having recently been refurbished, the JCR lounge offers table tennis and a plasma screen TVs with Sky TV, which are used to show major sporting fixtures during the academic term, as well as sofas and comfy seating. Members of the Middle Common Room have a dedicated postgraduate social space facility known as the MCR Bankside Room and is located on the ground floor of the Deerness block and includes facilities such as a TV, coffee machine, games console and study space. Members of the Senior Common Room makes use of the Prowse Room, which are located behind the Ann Dobson Dining Hall, and opposite the Lakeside Room. The SCR Prowse Room has tea and coffee machine and a reading room.

== Academic profile ==

In the year 2016–2017, 46% of Van Mildert undergraduates achieved Firsts, half a percentage points ahead of the last place Grey in the Evans Table, which lists the university&#x27;s 16 undergraduate colleges in order of their students’ examination performances, a system loosely based on Oxford&#x27;s Norrington Table and Cambridge&#x27;s Tompkins Table of college rankings. In recent years, its academic performance has skyrocketed with the college now ranking 7th in 2021–2022, ahead of St Chad&#x27;s but below St John&#x27;s.

The college is renowned for its emphasis on outreach and volunteering activities, with students of the college clocking up to 6300 volunteering hours. This is more than any Durham Colleges and have disproportionately represented half of university-wide volunteering activities. Additionally, the college has 6 outreach projects, with the oldest being the Young Person&#x27;s Project (YPP). In 2017, the college won the community category of the Green Gown Awards and was featured in the 2020 Parliamentary Review for best practice in Education Services.

Van Mildert has close connections with the Institute of Advanced Study, with the college offering two fellowships position for visiting scholars; the Arthur Prowse Fellowship, named after the college&#x27;s first Master, and the Arnold Bradshaw Fellowship. The fellowships are typically awarded for one academic term with the fellow residing in the college and becoming a member of the SCR. Recent fellows have included Adi Ophir and Mikhail Epstein. The Climate Impacts Research Centre is also closely associated with Van Mildert and frequently hosts lectures within the college.

=== Admission ===
Van Mildert accepts students from all academic disciplines and up to 1972, only accepted men. As in other Durham colleges, all admissions are handled centrally by the university, though the college have some role in the admissions of students, which are confined to identifying students that suit the college ethos and atmosphere – departments are responsible for admissions to the university, each college for admissions to that college.

Almost half of home students admitted to Van Mildert are from grammar school, though information of if it was selective or not is not held. In 2022/23, 37% of new undergraduate students are privately educated.

=== Collegiate studies ===
The college hosts a student enrichment programme known as the Dimensions Programme, which includes provision of a broad-ranging series of lectures, seminars and debates, along with skills-based activities such as networking sessions, employability initiatives and well-established work with the local community.

All first-year undergraduate at Van Mildert are allocated a college mentor, who are, for the most part, members of the academic staff of the college. In some cases, former alumni and current members of the MCR are also tasked to mentor undergraduate students. These students are obliged to attend weekly mentoring session, commonly over lunch on a Wednesday, where they support the students in their academic and personal development. Second, third, and fourth year students may opt-in for mentoring, yet are not made a compulsory requirement by the college.

== Student life ==

Van Mildert has one of the largest undergraduate and graduate intakes among Durham colleges, admitting 376 undergraduates and at least 150 graduate students in the 2023–2024 academic year. All first year undergraduates board and lodge within the college, which means that they are obliged to live, dine and read for their degree within the college grounds, though this arrangement is not universal and may be waived for local students whom lived within the area. A typical fresher&#x27;s room will have a single bed and are inclusive of heating, power, and internet access, and weekly cleaning by the college bedders (housekeepers). Second year students usually lives-out in the city with many finalists returning to live-in College. Arrangements for postgraduates varies, with the college reserving at least 61 rooms, mostly in Deerness Block for its graduate members.

Three cafeteria-style meals a day are served in the college dining hall, which are included in the boarding fee, where it is common for each hall corridors to go together. Out of term time, students who stays are permitted to use the kitchen facilities or bought meal directly in the college servery. 

=== Academic dress ===
Van Mildert previously obliged its students in wearing the college gown to formal hall, matriculation, college congregations and other academic or formal events, as it was evident in historical college matriculation photograph. It is not entirely sure precisely when or why the college dropped this convention, but college records has suggested that this tradition ceased with the admittance of women undergraduates in 1972.

Although the wearing of academic dress is no longer stipulated, formal dress (e.g. lounge suit and dress) is required in every formal events, such as matriculation and formal halls. In addition, students are required to wear black tie for men and ball gown for women at the end of term balls.

=== Common Rooms ===
All students of Van Mildert College are members of a common room, and which common room students are sorted solely depends on the level of study. All undergraduates are members of the Junior Common Room (JCR), and plays a central part in the life of the undergraduate community, offering social, recreational and welfare support to its students. The elected executive committee addresses many aspects of student life and liaises with the governing body and graduate student representatives. The governance of the JCR is stated in the constitution, which can only be amended by resolution of the JCR members during general meetings. Undergraduates constitute the majority of the student population of the college, with approximately 1200 JCR members as of the 2021–2022 academic year. Up until 2018 the Junior Common Room of Van Mildert College had a 236-page constitution, making it significantly longer than the Constitutions of most sovereign states. Following a referendum, Van Mildert JCR &quot;declared independence&quot; from the college authorities in 2019 and became an independent charity.

Graduate students of Van Mildert College are members of the Middle Common Room (MCR), which hosts its own events and benefits from a refurbished Common Room and separate accommodation in Deerness Block. It is similarly represented by the MCR Committee. Unique to the Van Mildert MCR is that all members of the MCR are also by virtue, members of both the Junior Common Room as well as the Senior Common Room, and therefore have the right to sit and dine in both low and high table, as well as having the right to vote in all the college&#x27;s common rooms. Members of the MCR are also entitled to make use of all the JCR and SCR facilities available in addition to their own.

The principal, college tutors and other academic and professional services staff of the college forms the Senior Common Room (SCR), and traditionally sits at high table for formal dinner. Alumni and local communities may also be elected members of the SCR.

=== Formals ===

Formals take place regularly during the academic term, with the college holding between three and five per term. Students are not required to wear their gown to formal dinners; instead, formal attire is worn except when it is a Ball where dinner jackets are worn. It is considered bad practice if attendees do not turn up in formal attire, and a popular college punishment is to run around the lake naked. At the end of the dining hall, a High Table composed of members of the SCR and their guests are present at every formal. Generally, members of the college gather in the College Bar 15-30 minutes before the start of the formal, and entrance into the dining hall is as announced by the JCR President with the ringing of the election bell, usually at 7 pm.

The High Table entrance and exit are then announced to attendees with another ringing of the election bell by the JCR President, signifying the official opening and closing of the formal meal. Speeches are common at formals and the Principal would also usually toasts the College motto, ‘sic vos non vobis’. Food at a formal meal usually consists of three courses and is often followed by an evening of entertainment.

The tradition of &quot;pennying&quot;, as part of a meal or drinking game, whereby dropping a penny with the Queen&#x27;s face in a person&#x27;s drink means that they must finish it in order to ‘save the Queen’ from drowning is endured within the college. 

===Arts===
The college has a number of groups involved in music, art, and the performing arts, collectively known as &#x27;Van MildARTS&#x27;. The college hosts an annual arts week and annual musical, with recent productions being &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Rent&quot; and &quot;Mama Mia!&quot; The college has a Big Band, Dance Society and Jam Society. This Society organises &quot;Jam by the Lake&quot;, the only open-air musical festival in County Durham and frequent winner of Purple Radio&#x27;s &#x27;Best Music Event&#x27; award.

===Sports===
The college has a sporting profile with a number of teams across a range of both traditional and non-traditional sports, including eight male football teams; two male rugby teams; a Women&#x27;s Rugby team, Van Maidan&#x27;s (joint with St Aidan&#x27;s College); Cheerleading (with the College team having won the Inter-Collegiate Competition for five consecutive years); Ultimate Frisbee; Darts (most notably the Women&#x27;s Darts &quot;D Team&quot;); and many more. Awards for graduating sports players are given at the Annual Sports Formal. This event celebrates the work and success of the sports teams, but more so the JCR Members who captain the teams and make up their Executive Committees.

====Boat Club====

Van Mildert Boat Club is the college rowing club. It was founded in 1965 by Simon Scott, an Engineering undergraduate at Durham University and one of the founding members of Van Mildert College. The boathouse of the club is on the River Wear, opposite Dunelm House and below Kingsgate Bridge.

The club competes against other college clubs in intercollegiate competitions organised by Durham College Rowing. It also takes part in regional events and national events (such as Head of the River Race, Women&#x27;s Eights Head of the River Race and BUCS Regatta).

VMBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code &quot;VAN&quot; and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing. 

The college boat house burnt down after an arsonist attacked it on 21 December 2021.

== Traditions ==

=== The Kazu ===

The Kazu is a traditional ceremony performed by the winning candidate after elections to the JCR Executive Committee, following the announcement of results by the JCR Chair. In more recent years, it has only been the elected president that performs a Kazu. A Kazu is a celebratory action which requires the winning candidate of every election to kick a full can of Coca-Cola down the stairs in the foyer, throw it over their head three times and then opening the can over their head. The JCR Standing Orders and website note that it &quot;may be done wearing clothes&quot; and that &quot;Wikipedia knows more about Kazus than anyone in College&quot;.

The tradition was started by a Japanese exchange student called Kazuhisa who regularly performed the Kazu in the JCR foyer. The first official Kazu is a topic for debate, one was performed by James Mackenzie in March 1997, upon being elected JCR President, and one was performed by James Warburton on March 1st 1997 following his crowning as Mr. Durham 1997. Mr. Warburton represented his college as Mr. Van Mildert and performed a highly acclaimed Haka to win the Mr. University crown.

=== Keeper of the College Things ===
Until at least the 2000s, Van Mildert JCR&#x27;s standing orders requires the annual election of a &#x27;Keeper of the College Things&#x27;. This role emerge previously from an earlier position called &#x27;Keeper of the College Darkroom&#x27; which lasted until at least the 1990s. The position of the Keeper of the College Things (KOTC) were specifically defined in the standing orders as to protect and maintain the care of college things, which includes: KOTC Ducks, whose duties includes the caring and protection of the college&#x27;s duck, particularly newborn ducklings; KOTC Stubble, whose duties include maintaining college students facial hair growth visible for seventy percent (70%) of the academic year; and KOTC Grounds, which is responsible for the care of college grounds, its lake and the surrounding areas.

== People associated with Van Mildert ==
Principals, fellows (including honorary fellows) or students who read for a Durham degree in Van Mildert College. Graduates of the college are collectively known as &quot;Mildertians&quot; and are a part of the Van Mildert Association, which cater for more than 7,500 living alumni.

<text>Sevendust is an American rock band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 1994 by bassist Vinnie Hornsby, drummer Morgan Rose and guitarist John Connolly. After their first demo, lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon and guitarist Clint Lowery joined the group. Following a few name changes, the members settled on the name Sevendust and released their self-titled debut album on April 15, 1997, which sold only 310 copies in its first week but ultimately achieved gold certification through touring and support from their label, TVT Records.

Since formation, Sevendust have attained success with three consecutive RIAA gold-certified albums, a Grammy nomination, and have sold millions of records worldwide. The group has released a total of fourteen studio albums, including a reissue of their debut as &quot;Sevendust: Definitive Edition&quot;, which contains five new tracks and a DVD.

==History==

===Early years and &quot;Sevendust&quot; (1994–1998)===

In 1994, bassist Vinnie Hornsby joined drummer Morgan Rose in a band called Snake Nation. John Connolly, a drummer at the time, joined the group as guitarist. They recorded their first demo, but were displeased with the lead vocals and hired Lajon Witherspoon following a yearlong search. Around the same time, guitarist Lee Banks joined to complete the lineup, and the band renamed themselves Rumblefish. Shortly after, Banks became dissatisfied with the touring schedule. The band subsequently replaced him with Clint Lowery.

Rumblefish were forced to rename themselves after discovering another band with the same name. They chose Crawlspace, and released &quot;My Ruin&quot; on the 1996 compilation album &quot;Mortal Kombat: More Kombat&quot; through TVT Records. However, the band had to change their name again after another group named Crawlspace sent notice that they wanted $2,500 in exchange for the naming rights. The band members elected to rename themselves Sevendust, inspired by the commercial insecticide brand &quot;Sevin Dust&quot;. The song &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; was included on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Home&quot;.

Sevendust released their self-titled debut, with partial production by former Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French, on April 15, 1997, known for its heavy riffs, angry vocals and thrash-like drumming, as in the songs &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Bitch&quot;. &quot;Black&quot; became the opening song for nearly every Sevendust concert until 2004. The debut album also contains the song &quot;My Ruin&quot;, from the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Sevendust&quot; appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, remained there for sixteen weeks and peaked at 165 on April 4, 1998. The album went gold on May 19, 1999.

In 1998, Sevendust performed at Dynamo Open Air (May 29–31) and Ozzfest 1998 (July through August). In the same year they released a compilation called &quot;Live and Loud&quot; which featured live footage of the band&#x27;s performance of September 16, 1998, at Chicago&#x27;s Metro.

===&quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Animosity&quot; (1999–2002)===
On August 24, 1999, they released their second album, &quot;Home&quot;. The album peaked at 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and featured Skin from Skunk Anansie and Chino Moreno from Deftones as guest vocalists. The two singles from the album, &quot;Denial&quot; and &quot;Waffle&quot;, gave the band moderate chart success, and the latter of which was played on the &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; show. They appeared in Woodstock 1999 and have toured with many bands such as Korn, Staind, Nonpoint, Reveille, Godsmack, Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, Powerman 5000, Creed, Kid Rock, Machine Head, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, and Metallica. In 1999, they gained European exposure by opening for Skunk Anansie at various shows in Germany. Skin from Skunk Anansie provided guest vocals on the track &quot;Licking Cream&quot; off &quot;Home&quot;. They also opened with Kid Rock and Ted Nugent for Metallica on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1999 at the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, Michigan. They also joined Slipknot, Slayer, Sepultura, Coal Chamber and other bands on the &quot;Tattoo the Earth Tour&quot; in June 2000. Also in 2000, the song &quot;Fall&quot; was recorded by producer Sylvia Massy in 1998 at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. &quot;Fall&quot; appears on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Scream 3&quot;.

In November 2001, the band released their third album, &quot;Animosity&quot;. This album went gold and gained the band commercial success thanks to the success of singles &quot;Praise&quot; and &quot;Angel&#x27;s Son&quot;, which peaked at 15 and 11, respectively, on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. In 2002, they covered &quot;Break the Walls Down&quot;, the theme song for professional wrestler Chris Jericho for the &quot;WWF Forceable Entry&quot; album. The song was never used as an official entry theme for him though. &quot;Angel&#x27;s Son&quot; was a tribute to Lynn Strait, the lead singer of the band Snot, whom the members of Sevendust were friends with. Strait had died in a car accident in 1998. In addition to being included on &quot;Animosity&quot;, the song was included on the compilation album &quot;Strait Up&quot;. The band made an appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; playing an acoustic version of &quot;Angel&#x27;s Son&quot; featuring Paul Shaffer on keyboards.

In the same year Sevendust was seen in the Chris Rock movie &quot;Down to Earth&quot; as a partial clip of &quot;Waffle&quot; is played.

Another friend of the band, Dave Williams, the lead singer of Drowning Pool, died in 2002. Tragedy would strike again when Lajon Witherspoon&#x27;s younger brother was shot and killed later that year. Due to his death, Sevendust went on hiatus in 2002.

=== &quot;Seasons&quot;, Clint Lowery&#x27;s departure and &quot;Next&quot; (2003–2005) ===
In 2003, Sevendust returned with their fourth album, &quot;Seasons&quot;. The album debuted at No. 14 in the US, selling around 68,000 copies in its first week. This was one of the band&#x27;s best received albums and to date features their highest-charting single (tied with &quot;Driven&quot;), &quot;Enemy&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. &quot;Enemy&quot; was made the official theme song for &quot;WWE Unforgiven 2003&quot;. Other singles released from the album, &quot;Broken Down&quot; and &quot;Face to Face&quot;, met with more moderate success charting at 20 and 22, respectively.

In 2004, for the first time in the band&#x27;s career, they released a live album on a CD/DVD double disk package titled &quot;Southside Double-Wide: Acoustic Live&quot;. Both the CD and the DVD include a cover of &quot;Hurt&quot; by Nine Inch Nails which is dedicated to Johnny Cash. This concert showcased a mellower side to the band with an acoustic performance.

On December 11, 2004, after playing a show in Columbus, Ohio, it was announced that Clint Lowery had left the band mid-tour, because he wanted to play with his brother Corey Lowery in his new band Dark New Day, who had reportedly just signed with Warner Bros. Records. A temporary guitarist was found for the rest of the dates, and Lowery was eventually replaced by Sonny Mayo (from Snot and Amen). At roughly the same time, Sevendust and TVT Records parted ways.

On October 11, 2005, Sevendust joined forces with good friend Producer/Engineer Shawn Grove and released their fifth studio album, &quot;Next&quot;, on the WineDark Records label, distributed by Universal Music. In the process, Sevendust also created their own record label, 7Bros Records. The album was actually recorded in a private house-turned-studio owned by a couple outside of the band&#x27;s hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, where Creed had recorded the Weathered record. The first radio single off &quot;Next&quot; was the track &quot;Ugly&quot;, released to radio August 9, 2005, followed by the music video. The track &quot;Pieces&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Saw II&quot;. &quot;Next&quot; debuted at No. 20 in the US, selling around 37,000 copies in its first week. Not much longer after the release of &quot;Next&quot;, Sevendust&#x27;s former label TVT Records released a greatest hits package for Sevendust, titled &quot;Best of (Chapter One 1997–2004)&quot;, the label&#x27;s final Sevendust release.

A few months after the October 2005 release date of &quot;Next&quot;, though, it became clear that WineDark would not live up to the band&#x27;s expectations. &quot;I had people come up to me and say, &#x27;When is the record coming out?&#x27; And it had already been out for five months&quot;, Rose grumbles. &quot;Basically, the main person that was in charge of the whole thing fell off the face of the earth. There were no more cheques coming in, and the money had not been paid in full.&quot;

=== &quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Chapter VII: Hope &amp; Sorrow&quot; and Clint Lowery&#x27;s return (2006–2008) ===
In early 2006, the band themselves were considered bankrupt. WineDark Records had imploded, leaving them without distribution, tour support, or promised advance payments. The band owed money to crew members and other staffers and had a mounting credit card debt. In April, they expected that a tax refund from the US government would help ease the burden. Then, they found out their accountant hadn&#x27;t paid their taxes and they owed $120,000 to the government. &quot;We were beyond broke&quot;, says drummer and lyricist Morgan Rose. &quot;We had a debt load close to a million dollars, and we were in a position where, no matter how much money we thought we were making, we were still having to pay and pay.&quot;

Sevendust (with Shawn Grove again serving as producer and engineer), released their sixth full-length studio album, entitled &quot;Alpha&quot;, on March 6, 2007. The album debuted at No. 14 in the US, the band&#x27;s highest chart position yet, selling over 42,000 copies of the album in its first week of sale. The disc contained the album&#x27;s preceding internet track &quot;Deathstar&quot;, the Hot Mainstream Rock top 10 smash &quot;Driven&quot; and a further Active Rock radio top 40 hit in the form of &quot;Beg to Differ&quot;. Alpha is the band&#x27;s second album featuring Sonny Mayo on rhythm guitar and the first with him as part of the writing process. Alpha is also the first album by the band to be released under the Warner-affiliated Asylum Records, making Sevendust the first rock band on that label. The band also headlined a 57-date tour from February 8, 2007, to April 28, 2007. Boston heavy metal band Diecast, supergroup Invitro, and modern rock Red accompanied Sevendust on the tour.

&quot;Retrospective 2&quot;, a CD/DVD combo including two previously unreleased studio tracks, live concert footage never before seen, as well as the new music videos for the songs &quot;Beg To Differ&quot;, &quot;Ugly&quot;, &quot;Pieces&quot;, and &quot;Driven&quot;, was released on December 11, 2007. The song &quot;The Rim&quot; was released on the Alpha CD but only sold in Target retails stores as exclusive 13th track on the Alpha CD. &quot;Feed&quot; and &quot;Driven&quot; were used in the soundtrack to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008.

Sevendust joined Shawn Grove again, and returned to the studio at the end of November 2007 to finish their 7th studio album, titled &quot;Chapter VII: Hope &amp; Sorrow&quot;. The record was originally slated for a release of March 4, 2008, but was later pushed back to April 1. The album debuted at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has appearances from Daughtry frontman Chris Daughtry, Alter Bridge members Myles Kennedy and Mark Tremonti. The first single from &quot;Chapter VII&quot; was &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, which peaked at No. 19 on the mainstream rock chart. The second single was &quot;The Past&quot; and the third &quot;Inside.&quot;
On March 26, 2008, Sevendust announced that Lowery had quit his duties as guitarist for Dark New Day and would be returning to the Sevendust lineup in place of Mayo. On Lowery&#x27;s return, Rose stated &quot;This was extremely tough considering Sonny is our brother and has been amazing to work with. [Sonny] didn&#x27;t do anything wrong at all; we just owe it to ourselves and all the folks that grew up with us to put our original band back together.&quot;

=== &quot;Cold Day Memory&quot; (2009–2011) ===
In December 2008 Sevendust toured with Black Stone Cherry for a while and then in January 2009, Sevendust geared up to hit the road with Disturbed, as well as multiple shows for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in the spring. Sevendust released a very limited-edition box set in November 2008 entitled &quot;Packaged Goods&quot;. Each five-disc set is personally autographed by the entire band. The box set includes Sevendust&#x27;s 2005 release &quot;Next&quot;, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Alpha&quot;, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Retrospective 2&quot; (CD + DVD), and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Chapter VII: Hope and Sorrow&quot;. Before heading into the studio to record their 8th studio album, the band headlined the &quot;End of Summer Scorcher&quot; held &amp; sponsored by 98KUPD in Phoenix, Arizona on September 26, 2009. Along with Sevendust, other notable acts such as Corey Taylor, Five Finger Death Punch, Shadows Fall &amp; Otep performed as well.

October 2009, Sevendust started recording &quot;Cold Day Memory&quot; in Chicago with producer Johnny K, who has produced other successful rock acts such as Disturbed, Staind, Finger Eleven, and 3 Doors Down. The band launched a newly designed website, promoting the new album. During the recording process the band posted daily videos on their official site and their YouTube channel; with updates on the new album, recording sessions in the studio and recording sessions from their new house. Stepping out of the box from regular recording sessions, they are showing the fans how the album process is done, and every step in the intricate process. On February 6, 2010, the band leaked the song &quot;Forever Dead&quot; on their website. Also &quot;Unraveling&quot; was released through iTunes on March 2. On March 17, the band streamed &quot;Last Breath&quot; on the radio. The following day, &quot;Confessions (Without Faith)&quot; received play time on the radio, as did &quot;The End is Coming.&quot; The band released its eighth album, &quot;Cold Day Memory&quot;, on April 20, 2010; the 12-song disc marked Sevendust&#x27;s first studio recording with the band&#x27;s original line-up since 2003&#x27;s &quot;Seasons&quot;. The first official single, &quot;Unraveling&quot;, hit No. 29 on The Rock Songs chart while the CD rocketed to No. 12 on The Billboard 200. The album includes two more singles, &quot;Forever&quot; and &quot;Last Breath&quot;, both of which were welcomed by Active Rock radio.

Sevendust toured with Chevelle, Shinedown, Puddle of Mudd, and 10 Years on the Carnival of Madness during the summer of 2010. The band also re-released their self-titled debut album called &quot;Sevendust: Definitive Edition&quot;. The re-release contains five new songs. In November 2010, it was announced that Sevendust would play alongside Disturbed, Korn and In This Moment in the &quot;Music As A Weapon 5&quot; tour. In February and March 2011, Sevendust toured in Australia with Iron Maiden, Slayer, Ill Niño and Stone Sour for the Soundwave Festival On October 16, 2011, the band headlined the second stage on the second day of the inaugural &quot;48 Hours Festival&quot; in Las Vegas, Nevada.

===&quot;Black Out the Sun&quot; and &quot;Time Travelers &amp; Bonfires&quot; (2012–2014)===
On June 27, 2012, Sevendust announced that they would enter the studio for their next album on September 5, 2012. They entered Architekt Music studios in Butler, New Jersey with engineer Mike Ferretti. Sevendust has completed recording its ninth album for an early 2013 release. In October 2012 interview, Lowery described the album as &quot;...a basic Sevendust record&quot;, stating &quot;There&#x27;s nothing, like, too completely different than anything we&#x27;ve done before. It&#x27;s got a darker vibe to it. We&#x27;ve got a good amount of the programming element in there. It&#x27;s a lot of what we do. it&#x27;s heavy and it&#x27;s got its melodic element in it&quot;. Additionally, he discussed the possibility of touring in early 2013 with Lacuna Coil.
Lowery later confirmed the album&#x27;s title to be &quot;Black Out the Sun&quot; as well. Sevendust announced they will release the album on their own 7Bros. Records label (through Warner Music Group&#x27;s Independent Label Group) on March 26, 2013. The album&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Decay&quot; was released to radio and retail outlets on January 22, 2013. Sevendust and Coal Chamber have announced a co-headlining tour around the United States that begins on March 28 and runs through April 28, 2013.

&quot;Black Out The Sun&quot; is Sevendust&#x27;s first album to score No. 1 on the Billboard charts, landing number one on the &quot;Top Hard Music Albums&quot; in the first week of its release and is the band&#x27;s best selling album in its first week of release since 2007&#x27;s &quot;Alpha&quot;. Sevendust later released another single, &quot;Picture Perfect&quot;, to rock radio stations.

The band recorded an acoustic album in early 2014 and will support the album with an acoustic tour. The album was recorded at Architekt Music in Butler, NJ, the same studio where the band&#x27;s 2013 album Black Out the Sun was recorded. The record, called &quot;Time Travelers &amp; Bonfires&quot;, was released on April 15, on 7Bros. Records, in conjunction with ADA Label Services. On April 1, the band hit the road for their first U.S. headlining tour of the year, entitled &quot;An Evening With Sevendust.&quot; The album&#x27;s first single is the acoustic version of Black (acoustic) which was added on radio stations on March 25, 2014. The album sold around 15,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to debut at position No. 19 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

In an April 13, conversation with Metalholic.com, guitarist Clint Lowery said the band hopes to record another acoustic album in about two years and wants to make it part of the Sevendust cycle. He also shared that the band plans to release a live DVD with both standard and acoustic concerts as well as a historical retrospective of the band for an early 2015 release. Guitarist John Connolly confirmed on his Facebook page that the live DVD recording was on hiatus due to business decisions and would likely be something the band would still pursue.

===&quot;Kill the Flaw&quot; (2015–2017)===
In February 2015, Sevendust entered the studio to begin recording their new album. It was reported that the band had finished recording their new album in late March 2015. Sevendust titled the new record &quot;Kill the Flaw&quot; which was self-produced and recorded at Architekt Music studio in Butler, New Jersey and was released on October 2, 2015, via 7Bros.

The band released lyric video for the song &quot;Not Today&quot; from the album on August 28. Sevendust traveled to Australia and New Zealand in March 2016. The tour marked the band&#x27;s first trip down under in six years after their slated 2014 Soundwave Festival appearance was controversially cancelled. The band suffered considerable backlash from Australian fans who lay the blame on the band for the last minute cancellation. The song &quot;Thank You&quot; was nominated for Best Metal Performance for the 2016 Grammy Awards.

==Musical style and influences==

Sevendust has played genres like alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, heavy metal, industrial metal, and post-grunge. Guitarist John Connolly was asked what the band defined their genre as. Connolly said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve been trying to figure that out. It was back in the day. People, for five minutes called us progressive, and then it was nu-metal. Then, all of a sudden, we were playing alternative metal. We are some kind of heavy and some kind of rock and some kind of metal.&quot;

According to AllMusic, Sevendust became one of the rising acts in late 1990s heavy metal with an aggressive blend of bottom-heavy riffs and soulful, accessible melodies. The band&#x27;s lead singer, Lajon Witherspoon, has been praised for his soulful vocals. Mark Jenkins of Washington Post states, &quot;Witherspoon is more flexible than most heavy-rock vocalists, capable of lilting as convincingly as he growls.&quot; Ultimate Guitar mentioned, &quot;He has a fairly distinct voice for metal, which originally helped the band stand out&quot;. A major part of the Sevendust sound has always been guitar player Clint Lowery. He is the main contributor to the band&#x27;s style and sound and is known for his raw melodies and empowering riffs. Lowery incorporates ultra-low baritone tunings, and creative 6-string tunings.

Sevendust&#x27;s influences include Metallica, Anthrax, Testament, Ozzy Osbourne, Pantera, Van Halen, Steve Vai, Iron Maiden, Ronnie James Dio, Nine Inch Nails, and Suicidal Tendencies. Frontman Lajon Witherspoon said he is influenced by &quot;so many&quot; genres of music, &quot;from R&amp;B, to rock, to jazz, and classical.&quot; Witherspoon then said he is &quot;influenced by everything.&quot;

<text>Kincumber is a south-eastern suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, nested between the Kincumba Mountain Reserve and the Kincumber Broadwater and located north of Sydney via the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (F3). It is part of the local government area. It is on Guringgai land

A nature reserve, Kincumba Mountain, is located within the suburb and is often used by the community for various functions, including picnicking, bush-walking, orienteering, parties, and carnivals.

Kincumber is also a skateboarding hub of the Central Coast. It has two skate facilities, one in Frost Reserve and the other in South Kincumber recreation area.

== History ==
The name derives from the local Aboriginal word &quot;kincumba&quot;, meaning &quot;towards the rising sun&quot; or &quot;to tomorrow&quot;. A large open flat rock area at the highest plateau of Kincumba Mountain, which commands panoramic views of the region, was used by Kuringgai people as a meeting place and camp. Being the highest open position in the region, it was first to receive the morning sun as it broke over the eastern horizon Tasman Sea/Pacific Ocean, and so this area was also referred to as &quot;towards tomorrow&quot;. Signs of habitation in the Kincumber area include axe-grinding grooves and rock engravings on Kincumba Mountain. 
Due to the freshwater creek, water access from Brisbane Water and the Hawkesbury River, and an abundance of old rainforest timber in the surrounding valley hills, Kincumber was one of the earliest settlements on the Central Coast, supplying wood for the needs of the growing colony at Sydney in the early 19th century. 

Boat building became an early local secondary industry after timber-getting, to meet the primary necessity of water transport. Boat-building along Kincumber Creek continued until the early 20th century. The last ship was built in the area in 1906 by George Frost. It was called the SS &quot;Rock Lily&quot;.
Kincumber was once home to a monazite processing plant that processed mineral sands mined in the local area. The plant was operated on the edge of Kincumber industrial estate, and backed on to Kincumber Creek. The site, &quot;Lot 500&quot;, is now abandoned but still has higher than average levels of radiation and has been deemed unsafe for development.
During road widening along Empire Bay Drive a radiological survey was conducted. Generally, the dose rates measured were well below the threshold of 0.7 μSv/h and indicate that the area had been remediated to a reasonable level, with a peak dose rate of 0.82 μSv/h being the only outlyer of the area surveyed. 

During the mid-1980s, the town made international headlines for the mistreatment of Eve van Grafhorst, a girl who contracted HIV through an infected blood transfusion after her premature birth. When van Grafhorst bit a child at kindergarten in 1985, she was not allowed to return unless she wore a face mask. The attitude of local residents eventually forced her and her family to move to Hastings, New Zealand. They were told by the Gosford City Council: &quot;Withdraw your daughter from kindergarten or we will go public with the fact she has HIV&quot;. Van Grafhorst and her family lived a relatively normal life in Hastings, where she was permitted to attend school. She eventually died from the disease in 1993, at the age of eleven.

On 28 August 2000, the Olympic torch relay passed through Kincumber en route to the Sydney Olympic Stadium.

<doc id="916896" wikidata="Q5146843" url="?curid=916896" title="College of St Hild and St Bede, Durham">
<text>The College of St Hild and St Bede, commonly known as Hild Bede, is a constituent college of Durham University in England. With over 1000 student members, The co-educational college was formed in 1975 following the merger of two much older single-sex institutions, the &quot;College of the Venerable Bede&quot; for men and &quot;St Hild&#x27;s College&quot; for women.

Hild Bede is neither a Bailey nor a Hill college, and is situated on the banks of the River Wear between Durham&#x27;s bailey and Gilesgate. As of 2024, the college is based temporarily at Rushford Court whilst the riverside site is undergoing renovation.

==History==
The College of the Venerable Bede, for men, was founded in 1839 with a small number of trainee schoolmasters. The college was expanded greatly over the next few decades with the assistance of trade unionist and future local MP William Crawford, who would later become the college&#x27;s treasurer. Its sister institution, St Hild&#x27;s College, was opened for the education of women on an adjacent site in 1858. Both colleges initially specialised in teacher training but in 1892 for Bede and 1896 for Hild they became associated with the federal University of Durham, offering BA and BSc degrees alongside teaching in education. Graduates of St Hild&#x27;s were the first female graduates from Durham in 1898. The Chapel of the Venerable Bede, completed in 1939 to celebrate Bede College&#x27;s centenary, was designed by the architectural partnership of Seely &amp; Paget.

The two colleges retained links throughout the next century with shared teaching and facilities. In the 1960s they constructed the shared Caedmon Complex. It was then that it was decided that the colleges should be formally merged and in 1975 they became the unitary College of St. Hild and St. Bede, a recognised college of the university. In 1979 Hild Bede joined the College Council, becoming a full constituent college of the university and ceasing to award its own PGCE qualifications. At this point some of the College buildings (including much of the teaching facilities of the Bede site) were occupied by the University&#x27;s Department of Education, whilst the college centred its academic administration on the old St Hild&#x27;s site.

=== College pre-renovation (1858-2024) ===
The original college consisted of several distinct buildings, including the main Hild building, which was the administrative hub of the college containing the main offices, computer room, common rooms and a large number of student rooms; other larger accommodation blocks, such as Thorp, Christopher, Bede; and several smaller houses such as Hild Gym, Bede Gym, Charles Stranks, Gables, Manor House, Manor Lodge, Belvedere, and, as of 2021, Ernest Place.

At the centre of college was the Caedmon Complex, which contains a dining hall, the bar (The Vernon Arms, named after the original Hild Bede Principal, Dr Vernon Armitage), music rooms and the only student-run cinema in Durham, Bede Film Society.

Hild Bede is also one of the two colleges in Durham to have two chapels, the other being University College. The Chapel of St. Hild is now a function room named the Joachim Room, and The Chapel of the Venerable Bede is still in use.

The college also maintains a boat house used by the boat club on the river near the Caedmon Complex.

=== Rushford Court ===
During the academic year 2024, the college moved temporarily to the Rushford Court site, in Durham&#x27;s viaduct area, to allow redevelopment of its historic Leazes Road site. The Rushford Court site is based around the Victorian buildings of the former County Hospital, with new accommodation blocks surrounding it. As part of the move, the University built a new &#x27;Heart&#x27; building on the site to house further student spaces, including the bar.

==Traditions==
===Symbols===
To maintain the history of the two original colleges, males in the college wear the Bede colours of light and dark blue, the colours that the college are more widely known for, whilst female colours are the green and lilac of the original Hild College. The College Arms also represents the history of the precursor colleges, with the chief taken directly from the Arms of the College of the Venerable Bede and the chevron being adapted from the bend of Arms of St. Hild College.

===Gowns===
The gowns worn by members of the college, retained from before the college became a constituent college of the university, differ from other Durham gowns in being made of brocaded fabric and being shorter. These are not worn at formal hall or matriculation (although gowns were once compulsory for matriculation). Formals are instead black tie events and happen around ten times a year, with both traditional formal dinners and themed formals such as for Halloween and St Patrick&#x27;s Day.

=== Anthem ===
The College&#x27;s official anthem is &#x27;Never Forget&#x27; by Take That, and is frequently thus performed by College staff during karaoke events, and played during formals.

===Postgraduate formals===
Held in the Joachim Room, these are formal, gowned, black tie dinners that happen four times per year.

===College events===
Like most Durham colleges, Hild Bede celebrates an annual college day, usually in early May. This day usually includes a champagne breakfast on the college lawns; an optional service in the cathedral; a buffet lunch in the dining hall and a marquee; picnics and barbecues on the lawns; and entertainment throughout the day including bands, fairground-style events, disco, ceilidh and college olympics.

In late April, the college is host to the sounding retreat ceremony in conjunction with the Durham Light Infantry Association. Initially instituted to remember students and staff of the Bede College Company who lost their lives at the Second Battle of Ypres, it now commemorates all former members of the college who have died in conflicts around the world.

The college also hosts two annual balls, the Winter Ball at the end of Michaelmas Term and the Summer Ball after exams have finished.

==Student Representative Council==
Unlike most colleges of the university, the student body is not divided into Junior and Middle Common Rooms, instead both the undergraduate and postgraduate communities are represented by a single Student Representative Council (SRC). The SRC does however contain a special postgraduate committee and maintains the physical Junior and Middle Common Rooms, both in the Hild Building. The SRC is run by an elected exec that is headed by a sabbatical president. The college also has a Senior Common Room (SCR) consisting of the college tutors, past and current members of college staff and invited members of the wider community.

===Executive Committee===
The running of the SRC is undertaken primarily by the Hild Bede SRC executive committee, a group of elected student volunteers headed up by a sabbatical and salaried President. The other &quot;exec&quot; roles are as follows: Social Secretary, Vice President, Postgraduate President, Treasurer, Chairperson, Communities and Liberations Officer, two Welfare Officers, International Officer, Publicity Officer, Ball Officer, Sports and Societies Officer, Environment Officer, and Technical Officer.

==Student life==
===Sport===
Hild Bede AFC are the college football club and is the college&#x27;s largest sports club with seven teams playing every-weekend in term time.

The college&#x27;s affiliated rugby teams are Bede RFC (the men&#x27;s team, playing in the traditional Bede College colours of light and dark blue) and Hild RFC (the women&#x27;s team, playing in the traditional St Hild&#x27;s College colours of green, purple and white). 
&#x27;Hild Bede Boat Club (HBBC) is the college rowing club, and qualified for Henley Royal Regatta in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016.

HBBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code &quot;SHB&quot; and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing.

The college also has its own squash club; running club; badminton club; and basketball club.

===Mascot===
The official Hild Bede college animal is the bear, and the mascot of Hild Bede SRC is &quot;Bedo&quot;, whose named is based on &quot;Bede&quot;, from the college&#x27;s name. The maintenance and grooming of Bedo is undertaken by the SRC Publicity Officer.

===Theatre===
Hild Bede Theatre is the biggest college drama society in Durham and puts on at least three productions annually, including a musical at the beginning of the third term. In 2009–10 they won two Durham Oscars, &quot;best college play&quot; for &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and &quot;Best college musical&quot; for &quot;42nd Street&quot;. They have won the latter more times than any other Durham theatre group, having won for the last 7 years in a row. In 2024, they performed &quot;Grease&quot; which won &quot;Best College Musical&quot;.

===Cinema===
Hild Bede houses the only student cinema in Durham, Bede Film Society - which is Durham&#x27;s oldest and cheapest cinema. The society used to showcase recent films on a 35mm projector, but, in celebration of the Bede Film Society&#x27;s 50th anniversary, has since installed a new digital projector funded by £40,000 of alumni donations, with Dolby Digital surround sound. Films are shown on most weekends of term, with the occasional midweek showing. The society was started over fifty years ago, before the merging of the two colleges, showing films on a 16mm projector.

===Bar Quiz===
Every Thursday, except during formal dinners, Hild Bede&#x27;s bar, &quot;the Vern&quot;, hosts its famous bar quiz, traditionally consisting of 50 questions on various topics. The winning team receives a £20 bar tab. Nowadays, the final round of the quiz is always a &quot;Wipeout&quot; round. In this round, answering a question incorrectly results in &quot;wiping out&quot; and thus receiving 0 points for the entire round. The Bar Quiz exists under the jurisdiction of the SRC Entertainment&#x27;s Committee (Ents Comm) and thus is overseen by the Social Secretary of the SRC, although it is also often set up by the SRC Tech Officer. In addition, it has been known for the Social Secretary to appoint a &quot;Head of Quizzes&quot;, from within Ents Comm, to help run these events. While the Social Secretary can wear what they like, it is customary and expected for the Head of Quizzes to wear their official royal blue Hild Bede sweatshirt.

===Awards===
Each year, several members of the college are awarded the Ann Boynton Award for outstanding contribution to college, for those who embody the spirit of the college whilst maintaining outstanding academic excellence. Winners of the Ann Boynton Award have their name permanently engraved into a board listing all the winners of the award, and the board is hung inside the Vern.

Another award is the Honorary Lifetime Membership award, given by the SRC President to those deemed to have contributed a great deal to college life. There is also the Senior Common Room Award, which is granted to a first year student who college staff believe has contributed significantly to the college.

<text>Sweden competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This nation has competed at every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era, except for the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. The Swedish Olympic Committee (, &quot;SOK&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s smallest team to the Games since the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. A total of 115 athletes, 62 men and 53 women, competed only in 20 different sports. Women&#x27;s football was the only team-based sport in which Sweden had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in boxing, diving, artistic gymnastics, judo, modern pentathlon, and rowing.

The Swedish team featured four prominent Olympic medalists: rifle prone shooter Jonas Edman, double trap shooter Pia Hansen, and swimmers Therese Alshammar and defending Olympic champion Lars Frölander, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Table tennis players Jörgen Persson and 1992 Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner were among the Swedish athletes to compete in fifth Olympics, since the sport had been formally included into the Olympic program in 1988. Notable Swedish athletes also included sprint kayak pair Henrik Nilsson and Markus Oscarsson, Greco-Roman wrestler Ara Abrahamian, who emigrated from his native Armenia to compete for the Swedish team, and tennis player Robin Söderling, the youngest male athlete of the team.

Sweden left Athens with a total of seven Olympic medals, four golds, two silver, and one bronze, matching its gold medal tally with Munich (1972), Montreal (1976), and Sydney (2000). Three individual Swedish athletes had won Olympic gold medals in athletics: Stefan Holm in men&#x27;s high jump, Christian Olsson in men&#x27;s triple jump, and Carolina Klüft in women&#x27;s heptathlon. Meanwhile, sprint kayak pair Nilsson and Oscarsson picked up their first Olympic title in men&#x27;s K-2 1000 metres, following their silver medal triumph in Sydney four years earlier.

<doc id="916913" wikidata="Q3552548" url="?curid=916913" title="Ushaw College">
<text>Ushaw College (formally St Cuthbert&#x27;s College, Ushaw) is a former Catholic seminary, which until 2011 was also a licensed hall of residence of Durham University near the village of Ushaw Moor, County Durham, England, which is now a heritage and cultural tourist attraction. The college is known for its Georgian and Victorian Gothic architecture and listed nineteenth-century chapels. The college now hosts a programme of art exhibitions, music and theatre events, alongside tearooms and a café.

It was founded in 1808 by scholars from the English College, Douai, who had fled France after the French Revolution. Ushaw College was affiliated with Durham University from 1968 and was the principal Roman Catholic seminary for the training of Catholic priests in the north of England.

In 2011, the seminary closed, due to the shortage of vocations. It reopened as a visitor attraction, marketed as Ushaw: Historic House, Chapels &amp; Gardens in late 2014 and, as of 2023, receives over 100,000 visitors a year. The County Durham Music Service and Durham University Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring are based at the college and buildings at the college are also used by Durham University Business School.

==History==

===Founding===
The English College, Douai was founded in 1568 but was forced to leave France in 1795 following the French Revolution.
Part of the college settled temporarily at Crook Hall near Lanchester, northwest of Durham. In 1804 Bishop William Gibson began to build at Ushaw Moor, four miles west of Durham. These buildings, designed by James Taylor, were opened as &quot;St Cuthbert&#x27;s College&quot; in 1808. There was a steady expansion during the nineteenth century with new buildings put up to cater for the expanding number of clerical and secular students. In 1847, the newly built chapel, designed by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin was opened. This was followed by the Big Library and Exhibition Hall designed by Joseph Hansom, 1849–1851. The Junior House, designed by Peter Paul Pugin, was added in 1859. St Cuthbert&#x27;s Chapel, designed by Dunn and Hansom, was opened in 1884, replacing AWN Pugin&#x27;s 1847 chapel which the seminary had outgrown. The Refectory was designed and built by E. W. Pugin. The final development came in the early 1960s with the opening of a new East wing, providing additional classrooms and single bedrooms for 75 students. The main college buildings are Grade II listed, the College Chapel is Grade II* and the Chapel of St Michael is Grade I.

===University of Durham===
Although independent, Ushaw College had a close working relationship with Durham University. The college became a Licensed Hall of Residence of the University of Durham in 1968. It was independent of the university but offered courses validated by the university, and both Church and lay students studied at the college. The Junior House closed in 1972, its younger students being transferred to St Joseph&#x27;s College, Up Holland in Lancashire.

===21st Century===

In 2002, the college rejected a report from the Roman Catholic hierarchy that it should merge with St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott, near Birmingham. However, in October 2010 it was announced that the college would close in 2011 due to the shortage of vocations in the Roman Catholic Church, and that the site might be sold. Following a detailed feasibility study by the college&#x27;s Trustees and Durham University, and with support from Durham County Council and English Heritage, it was announced in January 2012 that Durham Business School would temporarily relocate to the college during rebuilding of the school&#x27;s buildings in Durham. This was seen as the first step in a long-term education-based vision for the site.

The university also agreed to catalogue and archive the Ushaw library and inventory the other collections to ensure their preservation and specialist conservation, with a view to creating a proposed Ushaw Centre for Catholic Scholarship and Heritage. In March 2019, an uncatalogued early charter of King John was found in the library manuscript collection.

In 2017, Durham University announced plans to develop an international residential research library at Ushaw College, with the aim of attracting scholars from around the world to work on the collections of Ushaw, Durham University and Durham Cathedral. The university has also confirmed that it has extended the agreement to lease the east wing of the college (used by the Business School) to 2027. The college is also used for numerous musical events and for the Ushaw Lecture Series, organised by the university&#x27;s Centre for Catholic Studies.

In 2018, Durham University&#x27;s Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring (CEM) moved into the east wing of the college, previously used by the Business School.

The Junior Seminary Chapel of St Aloysius and adjacent common room buildings were badly damaged in a suspected arson attack in July 2023.

==Heraldry==
The college armorial bearings are &quot;Per pale dexter Argent a Cross Gules on a Canton Azure a Cross of St Cuthbert proper sinister impaling Allen Argent three Rabbits couchant in pale Sable.&quot;

Various emblems on shield represent the college&#x27;s history and foundation, for example:-
* Three coneys are from the family coat of arms of William Allen, the founder of English College, Douai. See Three hares.
* The small cross of St Cuthbert represents the college&#x27;s patron saint (it is modelled on St Cuthbert&#x27;s own pectoral cross, which is kept in the Treasury at Durham Cathedral).
* The large cross of St George honours the English Roman Catholic Martyrs.

<text>Abu Shusha () was a Palestinian Arab village in the Ramle Subdistrict of Mandatory Palestine, located 8 km southeast of Ramle. It was ethnically cleansed in May 1948.

Abu Shusha was located on the slope of Tell Jezer/Tell el-Jazari, which is commonly identified with the ancient city of Gezer.
In April–May 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abu Shusha was attacked several times. The final assault began on May 13, one day prior to Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence. Abu Shusha residents attempted to defend the village, but the village was occupied on May 14. The civilians who had not already fled or been killed were expelled by May 21. With their descendants, they numbered about 6,198 in 1998.

==Name==
Abu Shusheh is said to derive its name from a derwish who prayed for rain in a time of drought, and was told by a sand-diviner that he would perish if it came. The water came out of the earth (probably at Et Tannur) and formed a pool, into which he stepped and was drowned. The people, seeing only his topknot left, cried Ya Abu Shusheh (“Oh Father of the Topknot”).

==History==
The Crusaders called the place &quot;Mont Gisart&quot;. In 1177 the Crusaders won a battle against Saladin there. Ceramics and coins from the 13th century have been found here.

===Ottoman era===

A Maqam (shrine) was built there possibly in the 16th century. 
In 1838, Abu Shusheh was noted as a Muslim village in the &quot;Ibn Humar&quot; area in the District of Er-Ramleh. Edward Robinson also noted the village on his travels in the region in 1852.

In 1869 or 1872, the village lands were purchased by Melville Peter Bergheim of Jerusalem, a Protestant of German origin. Bergheim established a modern agricultural farm, using European methods and equipment. Bergheim&#x27;s ownership of the land was hotly contested by the villagers, by legal and illegal means, including the murder of Bergheim&#x27;s son Peter on 12 October 1885. After the Bergheim company went bankrupt in 1892, Abu Shusa&#x27;s lands were managed by a government receiver.

In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) noted that the extent of land farmed by Mr. Bergheim at Abu Shusheh was 5,000 acres. The boundaries was shown on the Survey&#x27;s map as a dotted line: ____ . . . . _____ . . . . 
SWP further described Abu Shusha as a small village built of stone and adobe and surrounded by cactus hedges, populated by about 100 families.

Elihu Grant, who visited the village, described it as &quot;tiny&quot; in 1907.
In 1910s, part of the land was sold by the government receiver to the villagers and the rest to the Jewish Colonization Association, which gave the villagers one third of their purchase in order to settle the dispute. After World War I, the land in Jewish hands was sold to the Maccabean Land Company, and later transferred to the Jewish National Fund.

In November, 1917, the British 6th Mounted Brigade charged a Turkish detachment defending the heights above Abu Shusheh. The Turks suffered &#x27;heavy casualties&#x27;.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Abu Shusheh&quot; had a population of 603 residents; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 627, still all Muslims, in a total of 145 houses.

The village had a mosque and a number of shops. A village school was founded in 1947, with an initial enrollment of 33 students.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Abu Shusha was 870, all Muslims, with a total land area of 9,425 dunams. 2,475 dunums of village land were allotted to cereals, 54 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 24 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.

===1948 massacre and aftermath===

The village was attacked by the Givati Brigade on May 13–14, 1948 during Operation Barak. A few inhabitants fled but most remained. The Givati troops were immediately replaced by militia men from kibbutz Gezer, who were later replaced by troops from Kiryati Brigade. On May 19, Arab Legion sources claimed that villagers were being killed. On May 21, Arab authorities appealed to the Red Cross to stop &quot;barbaric acts&quot; they said were being committed in Abu Shusha. A Haganah soldier was reported to have twice attempted to rape a 20-year-old woman prisoner. The residents that had remained in the village were expelled, apparently on 21 May.

More recent research, including that conducted by Birzeit University, suggests that around 60 residents were massacred by the Givati Brigade during the attack. In 1995 a mass grave with 52 skeletons was discovered, but their cause of death is undetermined.

The Israeli settlement of Ameilim was founded nearby later in 1948, while Pedaya was established in 1951; both on village land. The remains of the village were destroyed in 1965 as part of a government operation to clear the country of abandoned villages, which were regarded by the Israel Land Administration as &quot;a blot on the landscape&quot;.

In 1992 the village site was described: &quot;The Israeli settlement of Ameilim occupies much of the site. Figs and cypress trees, cactuses and one palm tree grow on the site. The surrounding valleys are planted in apricots and figs, and various kinds of fruit trees are cultivated on the heights.&quot;

<text>Blot-Sweyn (Swedish: &quot;Blot-Sven&quot;) was a Swedish king c. 1080, of disputed historicity, who was said to have replaced his Christian brother-in-law Inge as King of Sweden, when Inge had refused to administer the blót (pagan sacrifices) at the Temple at Uppsala. There is no mention of Sweyn in the regnal list of the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;, which suggests that his rule did not reach Västergötland. According to Swedish historian Adolf Schück he was probably the same person as Håkan the Red and was called the &quot;Blót Swain&quot; (a &quot;swain&quot; who was willing to perform the blót) as an epithet rather than a personal name.

==Becoming king==
The earliest source that deals with Blot-Sweyn&#x27;s coming to power is the Icelandic legendary saga &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;:

However, Inge did not permit the people to follow the old ways, unlike his father Stenkil. The Swedes reacted strongly and asked Inge to either comply with the old traditions or abdicate. When Inge proclaimed that he would not abandon Christianity, the people pelted him with stones and chased him away. This was the opportunity for Sweyn to assume power, and the account provided by &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; concerning his inauguration contains a rare description of the ancient Indo-European ritual of horse sacrifice:

==Legend of Saint Eskil==
The later &quot;Legend of Saint Eskil&quot; tells that Inge was chased away from the kingdom. They then elected an idolator for king by the name Sweyn, an unworthy man and with reason called &quot;Blood-Sweyn&quot;. He had this name because he made the people drink blood from bulls that had been sacrificed to the gods, and he ate the sacrificial meat. The people assembled around their king in Strängnäs, where they butchered oxen and sheep, and gave offerings to their gods. They had a great banquet in honour of the king and their gods. The English bishop Eskil then appeared and tried to convert the pagans to Christianity. They would not listen, however. Eskil prayed, and God sent thunder, hail, snow and rain destroying the sacrificial altar and beasts of sacrifice. Not a single drop fell on the bishop. The pagans were not impressed and furiously, they attacked Eskil. A diviner named Spåbodde hit him on the head with a stone, while another man crushed his head with an axe. Some chieftains dragged the dying martyr to the king saying that Eskil had used magic arts to control the weather. As soon as the unrightful king had sentenced Eskil to death, he was taken to the valley where the monastery later was founded, and he was stoned to death.

This legend is, however, only known from the late 13th century. An account by Aelnoth of Canterbury (c. 1122) relates that an Eskillinus was killed by pagan Swedes and Geats at an unspecified time. Since he is not mentioned by the clerical historian Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), he may have flourished in the late 11th century. According to another opinion, Eskil&#x27;s death is more probably dated in c. 1016, several generations before Blot-Sweyn.

==Death==
According to &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, the rule of Sweyn was not to last. Before long, the Christian Inge decided to kill the pagan Sweyn:

A similar account appears in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, but in this text, Sweyn remains inside and is burnt to death:
==Succession==
It is possible that Inge was not immediately accepted by the stubbornly pagan Swedes of Uppland. The 13th-century historian Snorri Sturlusson wrote in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; that Blót-Sweyn had a pagan successor who continued the sacrifices:

This &quot;Eirik Arsale&quot; (Erik Årsäll) is mentioned in other sources as being the son of Blot-Sweyn, but today is not considered a historical person by most historians.

<text>Stephenson College (formerly George Stephenson College, known colloquially as Stevo) is a constituent college of Durham University in Durham, England. 

It was founded in 2001 as part the university&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Campus in Thornaby-on-Tees. During 2017 to 2019, it relocated to the city of Durham, joining Josephine Butler College at the Howlands Farm site on Elvet Hill. It is named after George Stephenson, the 19th-century railway engineer and pioneer.

==History==

=== In Thornaby (1992-2019) ===

In 1992, University College, Stockton (UCS) was established on a new site in Thornaby-on-Tees, in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees, as a joint venture between the University of Durham and the University of Teesside. This was initially a joint venture, granting joint degrees validated by both institutions (BAs and BScs). However, Teesside, which had only become a university in 1992, had difficulties in taking on its responsibilities for the college and Durham took full control in 1998.

A programme of integration with Durham began, leading to the college becoming a college of the University of Durham in 1994 — the only college with teaching responsibilities. Further integration led to the campus being renamed the University of Durham, Stockton Campus (UDSC) in 1998, with teaching responsibilities being separated from the college structure. In 2001 UDSC was split into two colleges: George Stephenson College and John Snow College.

In 2006 the college name was changed to Stephenson College.

2010 saw the opening of Stephenson Central, in the middle of the college, housing a library, games, meeting and TV room with a bar at the centre, as well as the Junior Common Room office.

=== In Durham (2017-present) ===

Stephenson College and the other Queen&#x27;s Campus college, John Snow College, relocated to Durham on a phased basis starting in October 2017, completing in 2019. Stephenson College took over buildings formerly occupied by Ustinov College on the Howlands Farm site, adjacent to Josephine Butler College.
The college is a 15 minute walk from the Mountjoy site which contains many departments and large lecture theatres.

== Facilities ==

=== Accommodation ===

Stephenson is a self-catered college, with rooms arranged in flats with shared kitchens. All rooms are single-occupancy, and include en-suite rooms as well as those with shared bathrooms.

As of 2023, the college has 1304 members, with 433 living in college accommodation.

=== Communal facilities ===

Communal facilities in the college include &quot;Platform 1&quot;, the college&#x27;s café and bar; &quot;Platform 2&quot;, a performance venue and social space with two dart boards and a pool table;&quot;Platform 3&quot;, a study space and library; a shop, two gyms, further study spaces and a music room. The college also shares use of a multi-use space, Howlands Hall, with Josephine Butler College, which is used for sporting activities as well as formal meals.

=== Dining ===

Stephenson is a self-catered college and has no dining hall. However, optional formal and informal communal meals are held, with around six of each during the year.

=== Sports and Societies ===

The undergraduate student body (Junior Common Room or JCR) is governed by an elected Executive Committee headed by the President and supported by several other officers. Regular JCR meetings are held to discuss and vote on important issues. 

The JCR also supports many societies run exclusively for college students. The most popular societies include Stephenson College Boat Club (SCBC), Football, Rugby and Badminton.

<text>José Agustín Ramírez Gómez (19 August 1944 – 16 January 2024) was a Mexican novelist, short story writer, essayist and screenwriter. Publishing under the pen name José Agustín, he was considered one of the most influential and prolific Mexican writers of the second half of the 20th century.

==Life and career==
José Agustín was born in Acapulco, Guerrero, on 19 August 1944. He studied classical literature at the School of Philosophy and Letters of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), film direction at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos (CUEC) and dramaturgy at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura (INBA).

Agustín participated in Juan José Arreola&#x27;s writers&#x27; workshop from 1962 to 1965, where he wrote his first novel, &quot;La tumba&quot; (&quot;The Tomb&quot;), when he was nineteen years old. The novel was the brief but provocative story of a Mexican upper-class teen, deemed indecent by the public but gathering praise from older writers. This and his most famous work, &quot;De perfil&quot; (&quot;Profile View&quot;), a fast and detailed view of three days in the main character&#x27;s life, show stylistic similarities to James Joyce&#x27;s work, especially &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;.

Agustín was considered a member of the so-called &quot;Onda&quot; literature, &quot;onda&quot; (wave) being slang for current and fashionable views in the eyes of young people.

A common technique in his work is mixing a character&#x27;s speech with narrative, without making any kind of distinction (free indirect discourse). Thus the reader finds a long dialogue written in a single sentence, and is expected to realize which character is speaking as he reads the words. He also made use of the stream of consciousness technique.

Agustín taught at the University of Denver, the University of California, Irvine, and the University of New Mexico.

Agustín died in Cuautla, Morelos, on 16 January 2024, at the age of 79.

<doc id="916931" wikidata="Q6258446" url="?curid=916931" title="John Snow College, Durham">
<text>John Snow College is a constituent college of Durham University. The college was founded in 2001 on the university&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Campus in Stockton-on-Tees, before moving to Durham in 2018. The college takes its name from the nineteenth-century Yorkshire physician John Snow, one of the founders of modern epidemiology.

The college is a fully self-catered college of the university, and is relatively new in comparison to other existing Durham undergraduate colleges. Rooms in the college can be found in a mixture of flats and townhouses, with all rooms in flats being ensuite. The college also has extensive leisure facilities including a large dining and entertainment hall, a gym, a yoga and dance studio, a performance practice studio, and music rooms. It is now located on the Mount Oswald site, which opened in 2020.

==History==
John Snow College has its origin in 1992, when the Joint University College on Teesside of the Universities of Durham and Teesside (JUCOT) was established as a joint venture between the University of Durham and the University of Teesside. Durham University would take full control of the university college in 1994, and it would be renamed to University of Durham, Stockton Campus (UDSC). John Snow College was then formed in 2001, when the UDSC was split into John Snow College and Stephenson College. At that time, the campus was renamed the University of Durham, Queen&#x27;s Campus (UDQC), in honour of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

In 2018, John Snow College moved temporarily to the Howlands Farm site in Durham City, adjacent to Josephine Butler, Durham and Stephenson College, Durham. For the 2019-20 year, the college moved to Rushford Court in the centre of Durham, a privately operated hall on the site of the former County Hospital.

In 2020, the college moved to its permanent home in new purpose-built buildings at Mount Oswald, between South College, Durham and Durham University Business School. The site has seven blocks named after the roads surrounding the Broad Street pump from which John Snow removed the handle during the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak: Wardour, Bridle, Carnaby, Marshall, Lexington, Hopkins and Broadwick. Broadwick blocks are built like townhouses, with shared bathrooms, and are located at the back of the college. The rest of the blocks offer ensuite bathrooms and are divided into cluster flats housing 6-8 people. By the main gates of the college, in between Bridle and Wardour, resides a replica of the water pump Snow removed the handle from.

=== Shield and motto ===
The college arms are blazoned as &quot;Argent a Cross formy quadrate azure, a chief azure thereon a Yorkshire rose argent between two lions rampant Or&quot;.

The college&#x27;s motto is &quot;Per scientiam et prudentiam quaere summam&quot;, which can be translated to &quot;to seek the highest through knowledge and wisdom&quot;.

== Facilities ==
=== Main Building ===
The Main building is home to the Junior Common Room (JCR) and Middle Common Room (MCR). It is also the location of the Stockton Room, the Bateman Room, the Sackville Room and college&#x27;s bar, Igloo Bar and Café.

=== The Hub Building ===
The Hub building contains a large dining/entertainment hall, a gym, a yoga/dance studio, a performance practice studio, a faith/quiet room, the John Snow Music Room, and a shared Music Room. The college also possesses an outdoor multi-use games area, often utilised for sports.

=== Accommodation Blocks ===
The accommodation blocks at John Snow College contain a total of 492 student bedrooms and 4 self contained flats for staff or visiting fellows. Rooms in the college are divided into Flats and Townhouses. First-year undergraduate students are accommodated either in an ensuite Flat or a Townhouse room. Around 40 postgraduate Masters&#x27; students are provided with accommodation in college Townhouses. Around 40 second-, third-, and final-year undergraduate students (or &quot;returners&quot;) are accommodated in the college each year within two college Townhouses and two larger Flats.

== Student life ==

In contrast with the other constituent colleges of Durham University, both undergraduate and postgraduate students at John Snow College are members of the college&#x27;s Junior Common Room (JCR). Consequently, there is no Middle Common Room (MCR), and the JCR instead has a Postgraduate Representative role as part of their executive committee. The JCR governs sports teams, student societies and arts groups, and organised other academic and recreational activities.

=== Societies ===

While university-wide student associations and societies are associated with the Durham Students&#x27; Union, the JCR governs the many student societies of the college. For example, Music Society, The Snow Globe Theatre Company, Baking Society, LGBTQ+ Society, Art Society, FemSoc, Plant Society, Bean Society, Vegetarian and Vegan Society, Book Club, Dance Society, Christian Union, Cooking Society, British Sign Language Society, RUnning Club, Fitness &amp; Wellness, BAME Society, Hiking Society.

=== Traditions ===
John Snow holds termly formal dinners, in which members of the college attend in their relevant academic dress of Durham University. A set of rules governing behaviour at formals is outlined by the college, and disciplined by the JCR Chairman. Two college Balls are held per annum, one in the Michaelmas Term and a further Graduation Ball in the Easter Term, with a large portion of the college in attendance.

==== Snow Day ====
The annual Snow Day is a celebration of college life. The event is held within college accommodation and features entertainment, music and food. The day begins with a water fight in the spirit of Snow&#x27;s medical research into the causes of the Broad Street cholera outbreak, which was ultimately traced to the water supply, with the first water fight occurring on the first Snow Day on 27 May 2002.

==== Matriculation ====
John Snow College is the only college in Durham to have the position of &#x27;College Bugler&#x27;. Each year the college bugler processes the new intake of students through the city of Durham and announces their arrival at the cathedral, ready for Matriculation. The bugler also attends all formal events and announces the high table at the beginning of each formal.

It is tradition for all new members of the college to be matriculated by walking up the main path from the JCR building towards the gates, where they are led by a student dressed as John Snow, then walking under a John Snow banner which formally welcomes them into the college.

=== Sports ===
John Snow College fields teams in 16 sports: Men&#x27;s Football, Women&#x27;s Football, Men&#x27;s Rugby, Women&#x27;s Rugby, Basketball, Rowing, Lacrosse, Hockey, Netball, Rounders, Tennis, Badminton, Cricket, Futsal, Squash, Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, and Cheer.

John Snow College Boat Club (JSBC) is the rowing club of the college, which developed out of the University of Durham Stockton Campus Boat Club (UDSCBC). JSBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code &quot;JSC&quot; and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing. 

John Snow Rugby Club (JSRFC) was founded in 2001. The club won the university floodlit cup in 2013. JSRFC stopped competing in rugby from 2017 to 2019, but reformed in the 2019/2020 season, and earned promotion in 2021/22.

<text>In cell biology, bulk flow is the process by which proteins with a sorting signal travel to and from different cellular compartments. In other words, bulk transport is a type of transport which involves the transport of large amount of substance like lipid droplets and solid food particles across plasma membrane by utilising energy. Special processes are involved in the transport of such large quantities of materials, which include endocytosis and exocytosis.

It is thought that cargo travels through the Golgi cisternae (from cis- to trans- Golgi) via bulk flow.

<text>Primary [[glider aircraft|glider]]s are a category of aircraft that enjoyed worldwide popularity during the 1920s and 1930s as people strove for simple and inexpensive ways to learn to fly.

Constructed of wood, metal cables and cloth, primary gliders were very light and easy to fly. They generally had no cockpit and no instruments.

==Operations==
Primary gliders were generally launched by bungee cord, whereby a rubber rope was arranged in a &quot;V&quot; with the glider at the apex. The ends of the rope were pulled by hand to launch the glider from a slope. Primaries were also launched by auto-tow and auto-bungee tow. Ramp launching from cliffs was also attempted successfully.

==Modern primaries==
Modern versions of primary gliders are still built, but, while they are much like the originals in appearance, they are usually constructed with composites and safety enhancements.

<doc id="916953" wikidata="Q270083" url="?curid=916953" title="Jazz (Queen album)">
<text>Jazz is the seventh studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 10 November 1978 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker, the album artwork was suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a similar design painted on the Berlin Wall. The album&#x27;s varying musical styles were alternately praised and criticised. It reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. 

== Recording ==
Rehearsals for &quot;Jazz&quot; began during the first week of July 1978. The month before, in June, the band had received a hefty tax bill and subsequently decided to record outside of the United Kingdom. They had to make a swift decision, as Brian May would be forced out of the UK on 2 July due to these tax-related issues. This was shortly after the birth of his first child, Jimmy. As May relocated to Canada, the rest of the band flew to Nice, France, to begin rehearsing for the album. May soon joined the rehearsals.

The band attended the nearby Montreux Jazz Festival, which likely inspired the title of the album. There, they ran into David Bowie, who was working on his 1979 album &quot;Lodger&quot; between tour dates. Bowie convinced them to record at Mountain Studios in Montreux.

Before the band shifted to Montreux, they finished preliminary recordings of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, &quot;In Only Seven Days&quot;, and &quot;More of That Jazz&quot;. Production on the album was moved to Montreux the day after the jazz festival. On 19 July, May&#x27;s 31st birthday, the band attended the 18th stage of the 1978 Tour de France, which inspired Freddie Mercury to write the lead single, &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;.

During the next three weeks the band were in Mountain Studios, they primarily worked on &quot;Fun It&quot;, &quot;Jealousy,&quot; &quot;Leaving Home Ain&#x27;t Easy,&quot; &quot;Let Me Entertain You.&quot; The band took a few days off, most notably on 26 July when they trashed a Montreux hotel whilst celebrating Taylor&#x27;s 29th birthday. Mercury was reportedly seen swinging on a cut-glass chandelier in the hotel during the party.

After a brief holiday in the middle of August, the band moved production back to France, where they worked at Super Bear Studios. They would spend the rest of the month recording &quot;Mustapha&quot;, &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;, &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Beat Them&quot;, &quot;Dead On Time&quot;, and &quot;Dreamer&#x27;s Ball&quot; (based on the previous lists of completed songs).

The band completed overdubbing the songs in September, and mixed the lead single early before sending it to New York City for mastering, which was completed on 14 September. They mixed the rest of the album beginning in the middle of the month. &quot;Jazz&quot; was officially completed on 14 October, during a mastering session at Super Bear Studios.

==Songs==
===Side one===
====&quot;Mustapha&quot;====

&quot;Mustapha&quot; is a song written by Freddie Mercury. It was released as a single in 1979.

The lyrics consist of English, Arabic, Persian and possibly a number of invented words. Some understandable words are &quot;Mustapha&quot;, &quot;Ibrahim&quot; and the phrases &quot;Allah, Allah, Allah we&#x27;ll pray for you&quot;, &quot;salaam alaykum&quot; and &quot;alaykum salaam&quot;.

In live performances, such as the performance on &quot;Live Killers&quot;, Mercury would often sing the opening vocals of &quot;Mustapha&quot; in place of the complex introduction to &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, going from &quot;Allah, will pray for you&quot; to &quot;Mama, just killed a man...&quot;. He also sang the intro before launching the band into &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot;, as seen on &quot;We Are the Champions: Final Live in Japan&quot;. However, from the 1979 Saarbrücken Festival to the South American Game Tour, the band performed an almost full version of the song, with Mercury at the piano.

====&quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;====

&quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; was written by Brian May with lead vocals shared by Mercury and May, who sings lead on the chorus. On stage Mercury sang the entire song, with Roger Taylor and May doing harmonies. Both guitar and bass are played in drop-D tuning for this song, a rarity for Queen.

====&quot;Jealousy&quot;====

&quot;Jealousy&quot; was penned by Mercury and features May playing his Hallfredh acoustic guitar. The guitar had been given a replacement hardwood bridge, chiselled flat, with a small piece of fret wire placed between it and the strings, which lay gently above. The strings produce the &quot;buzzing&quot; effect of a sitar. This effect had already been used on &quot;White Queen (As It Began)&quot;, from &quot;Queen II&quot;. All vocals were recorded by Mercury.

====&quot;Bicycle Race&quot;====

&quot;Bicycle Race&quot; is a complex composition by Mercury. It features several modulations, unusual chord functions, a meter change (4/4 to 6/8 and back), and a programmatic section (a race of guitars emulating the bicycle race).

====&quot;If You Can&#x27;t Beat Them&quot;====
&quot;If You Can&#x27;t Beat Them&quot; is another hard rock composition by John Deacon and a live favourite for the band in the late 1970s. It is one of the few songs by Deacon where May plays all the guitars.

====&quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;====
&quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; was written by Mercury, directed towards the audience. The line &quot;we&#x27;ll sing to you in Japanese&quot; is a reference to May&#x27;s Teo Torriatte, from &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1976). The song also contains a reference to their tour manager, Gerry Stickells with the line &quot;Hey! If you need a fix, if you want a high, Stickells will see to that.&quot; And then, on the very next line, Mercury mentions Queen&#x27;s record labels at the time (Elektra, and EMI) with the line &quot;With Elektra and EMI; we&#x27;ll show you where it&#x27;s at!&quot;. The idea of a guitar riff in parallel sixths was re-used later in the &quot;Innuendo&quot; track, &quot;The Hitman&quot;.

===Side two===
====&quot;Dead on Time&quot;====
&quot;Dead on Time&quot;, written by May, contains two high belts by Mercury that top at C5. It was never played in concert; May would only incorporate snippets of it in his guitar solos during the &quot;Jazz&quot; Tour and the &quot;Works&quot; Tour.

The song ends with the sound of a thunderbolt, followed by Mercury screaming &quot;You&#x27;re dead!&quot; The thunderbolt was actually recorded by May on a portable recorder during a thunderstorm. The album&#x27;s liner notes credit the thunderbolt to God.

====&quot;In Only Seven Days&quot;====
&quot;In Only Seven Days&quot; is Deacon&#x27;s other songwriting contribution on the album. Deacon also played acoustic and electric guitar on this song. It was the B-side on &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;.

====&quot;Dreamer&#x27;s Ball&quot;====
&quot;Dreamer&#x27;s Ball&quot; is Brian May&#x27;s tribute to Elvis Presley, who died one year before the album was released. The arrangement for the concert version was completely different, with May and Taylor doing vocal brasses.

====&quot;Fun It&quot;====
&quot;Fun It&quot; is a funk track with a disco vibe by Taylor, where both he and Mercury shared the vocals. Taylor did the lead vocals, while Mercury was backup. Taylor used Syndrum pads and played most of the instruments. It can be seen as a precursor to &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, especially with the intro of this track.

====&quot;Leaving Home Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;====
&quot;Leaving Home Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot; is a ballad by May, who also sang all the vocals (lead and harmony). His voice was sped up for the bridge in order to create a feminine voice.

====&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;====

&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; was written by Mercury. It was a top ten hit single in the UK. May&#x27;s only input is a short guitar solo and backing vocals. The song was used in the bar scene of the motion picture &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, and in a fight scene in the 2015 motion picture &quot;Hardcore Henry&quot;. In addition, the BBC show &quot;Top Gear&quot; named it the top song in a viewer poll of Top Ten driving songs. Google also used the song for their Google Doodle to commemorate Mercury&#x27;s 65th birthday on 5 September 2011.

====&quot;More of That Jazz&quot;====
&quot;More of That Jazz&quot;, written by Taylor, is loop based and Taylor plays most instruments and sings all vocals, reaching some very high notes (peaking on an E5). The coda also contains short clips from many songs on the album, including &quot;Dead on Time&quot;, &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;, &quot;Mustapha&quot;, &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Beat Them&quot;, &quot;Fun It&quot;, and &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;.

==Release==
===Alternative artwork===
A bicycle race with nude women was held to promote the album and the &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;/&quot;Bicycle Race&quot; single. A poster of the start of the race was included with copies of the LP. A smaller portion of the poster image also used as an alternative single cover for &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;.

A small version of the poster was included with the &quot;Crown Jewels&quot; box set.

===Singles===
Four singles were released from the album:

*&quot;Bicycle Race&quot;/&quot;Fat Bottomed Girls (edit)&quot; – Elektra E45541; released October 1978.
:&quot;Bicycle Race&quot; and &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; were released in 1978 as a double A-side; the band staged a famous nude, all-female bicycle race to promote the single. The bicycle race took place on 17 September 1978 at Wimbledon Stadium in London. The picture sleeve showed a rear view of one of the ladies on her bicycle, but a pair of red panties were painted on to avoid public outcry. Legend has it that the band borrowed the bicycles from a store (&quot;Halfords&quot;, according to the liner notes), but upon returning them were informed that they would have to purchase all the seats, as they had been used in an improper manner (i.e. without clothing).
*&quot;Mustapha&quot; was released in 1979 only in Bolivia, Spain, Yugoslavia and Germany. Its B-side was &quot;Dead on Time&quot; (&quot;In Only Seven Days&quot; in Yugoslavia).
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;/&quot;More of That Jazz&quot; – Elektra E46008; released February 1979.
:&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; was released in 1979; its B-side was &quot;In Only Seven Days&quot; (&quot;More of That Jazz&quot; in the US and Canada).
*&quot;Jealousy&quot;/&quot;Fun It&quot; – Elektra E46039; released April 1979.
:&quot;Jealousy&quot; was released in 1979 in the US, New Zealand, Brazil, USSR, and Canada; its B-side was &quot;Fun It&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; in USSR, on a blue flexi disc).

===Tour===
==Reception==
Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1979, Dave Marsh panned &quot;Jazz&quot; as &quot;more of the same dull pastiche&quot; from Queen, who he said displayed &quot;elitist notions&quot; with some of their musical choices and lyrics. Marsh said &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; treated women &quot;not as sex objects but as objects, period (the way the band regards people in general)&quot;, and finished by famously tagging Queen &quot;the first truly fascist rock band&quot;. Mitchell Cohen of &quot;Creem&quot; gave another negative review, calling &quot;Jazz&quot; &quot;absurdly dull&quot; and filled with &quot;dumb ideas and imitative posturing&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said the album was not wholly bad, even finding &quot;Bicycle Race&quot; humorous, although he said Queen sounded like the band 10cc &quot;with a spoke, or a pump, up their ass&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; concluded that, &quot;while the surfaces remain as mainstream and as accessible as ever, there&#x27;s a maturity to Queen that suggests even more advances are possible.&quot;

In a retrospective assessment, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as &quot;one of their sleekest albums.&quot; He cited that the album&#x27;s diversity and exaggeration made it &quot;more fun than any of their other albums.&quot; Alexis Petridis wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;&quot;Jazz&quot; was hysterical in every sense of the word, but the music press comprehensively failed to get the joke, particularly in the US&quot;. In 2006, Jim DeRogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; included it in his list of &quot;The Great Albums,&quot; describing it as &quot;a genre-hopping tour of diverse musical styles&quot; and concluded that &quot;What ultimately keeps me coming back to the album, however, is that ambiguous sexual energy running through all 13 tracks; the fact that each of them boasts more hooks than some bands have on an entire album, and the inviting sonic density of it all.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was less favorable, awarding the album 1 and a half stars.

When &quot;Loudersound&quot; ranked every Queen album from best to worst, &quot;Jazz&quot; came fourth, as they felt it presented &quot;some of the most satisfying moments in Queen&#x27;s career.&quot; In a similar list of the band&#x27;s greatest albums, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;Jazz&quot; in third position. &quot;Whenever discussions take place about Queen&#x27;s incredible string of classic albums throughout the late &#x27;70s,&quot; they wrote, &quot;1978&#x27;s &#x27;Jazz&#x27; is the one that often seems to get the shortest shrift, but tucked away behind its unusually nondescript cover art lies one of the band&#x27;s finest albums. Never mind the reliable hit single double-whammy provided by &#x27;Fat Bottomed Girls&#x27; and &#x27;Bicycle Race,&#x27; &quot;Jazz&quot; is astonishingly deep with underrated Queen gems, ranging from Mercury&#x27;s Eastern-spiced wig-out &#x27;Mustapha,&#x27; to Deacon&#x27;s head-banging beast &#x27;If You Can&#x27;t Beat Them, Join Them,&#x27; to Taylor&#x27;s infectious disco tune &#x27;Fun It&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; subsequently featured it on their list of &quot;10 Classic Albums Rolling Stone Initially Panned&quot;, indicating they now regarded the album as a &quot;classic.&quot; They poked fun at Marsh&#x27;s original negative review of the album, quipping, &quot;Sometimes a reviewer just seems to have a really, really low opinion of a band, which seems to be the case with Dave Marsh and Queen.&quot;

==2011 re-issue==
In March 2011, a remastered and expanded reissue of the album was released. This was part of a new record deal between Queen and Universal Music, which meant Queen&#x27;s association with EMI Records would come to an end after almost 40 years. All Queen albums were remastered and reissued in 2011. The deluxe edition contains five additional tracks on a separate EP. The second batch of albums (the band&#x27;s middle five albums) were released in June 2011. The extra tracks included the single version of &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, an instrumental version of &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;, a version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; with &quot;long lost guitars&quot;, a live version of &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;, and an early acoustic take of &quot;Dreamer&#x27;s Ball&quot;.

The 2011 reissue corrected the tape glitch at the beginning of &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; which had been present on all previous compact disc editions of the album (as well as 1997 compilation album &quot;Queen Rocks&quot;); however, it also added a previously unused kick-drum part to the track &quot;Jealousy&quot;, making the track sound drastically different from all previous releases.

<doc id="916963" wikidata="Q2205923" url="?curid=916963" title="SETL">
<text>SETL (SET Language) is a very high-level programming language based on the mathematical theory of sets. It was originally developed at the New York University (NYU) Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in the late 1960s, by a group containing (Jack) Jacob T. Schwartz, R.B.K. Dewar, and E. Schonberg. Schwartz is credited with designing the language.

== Design ==
SETL provides two basic aggregate data types: (unordered) &quot;sets&quot;, and &quot;tuples&quot;. The elements of sets and tuples can be of any arbitrary type, including sets and tuples themselves, except the undefined value om (sometimes capitalized: OM). &quot;Maps&quot; are provided as sets of &quot;pairs&quot; (i.e., tuples of length 2) and can have arbitrary domain and range types. Primitive operations in SETL include set membership, union, intersection, and power set construction, among others.

SETL provides quantified boolean expressions constructed using the universal and existential quantifiers of first-order predicate logic.

SETL provides several iterators to produce a variety of loops over aggregate data structures.

== Examples ==
Print all prime numbers from 2 to :
 print([n in [2..N] | forall m in {2..n - 1} | n mod m &gt; 0]);
The notation is similar to list comprehension.

A factorial procedure definition:
 procedure factorial(n); -- calculates the factorial n!
 return if n = 1 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1) end if;
 end factorial;

A more conventional SETL expression for factorial (n &gt; 0):
 */[1..n]

== Uses ==
Implementations of SETL were available on the DEC VAX, IBM/370, SUN workstation and APOLLO.
In the 1970s, SETL was ported to the BESM-6, ES EVM and other Russian computer systems.

SETL was used for an early implementation of the programming language Ada, named the NYU Ada/ED translator. This later became the first validated Ada implementation, certified on April 11, 1983.

According to Guido van Rossum, &quot;Python&#x27;s predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL -- Lambert Meertens spent a year with the SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design!&quot;

==Language variants==
&quot;SET Language 2&quot; (SETL2), a backward incompatible descendant of SETL, was created by Kirk Snyder of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University in the late 1980s. Like its predecessor, it is based on the theory and notation of finite sets, but has also been influenced in syntax and style by the Ada language.

&quot;Interactive SET Language&quot; (ISETL) is a variant of SETL used in discrete mathematics.

&quot;GNU SETL&quot; is a command-line utility that extends and implements SETL.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in São Tomé and Príncipe on 20 January 1991. They were the first multi-party elections for the National Assembly, following a referendum the previous year. The result was a victory for the Democratic Convergence Party-Reflection Group, which won 33 of the 55 seats, defeating the former sole legal party, the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe - Social Democratic Party. Voter turnout was 76.7%.

==Background and outcome of elections==
The main political parties in the election were the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe - Social Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD), the former sole legal party and the Democratic Convergence Party - Reflection Group (PCD-GR), a party formed by a coalition of MLSTP dissidents, independents, and young professionals. Some of the smaller parties that participated in the election were the FDC, or Christian Democratic Front and the Democratic Coalition of the Opposition (CODO), created by the merger of three former overseas opposition movements.

The elections, deemed transparent, free, and fair resulted in victory for the PCD-GR, with the MLSTP defeat blamed on the country&#x27;s economic problems. A transitional government headed by Daniel Daio was installed in February pending presidential elections to be held in March.

<doc id="916971" wikidata="Q1142489" url="?curid=916971" title="Nuclear marine propulsion">
<text>Nuclear marine propulsion is propulsion of a ship or submarine with heat provided by a nuclear reactor. The power plant heats water to produce steam for a turbine used to turn the ship&#x27;s propeller through a gearbox or through an electric generator and motor. Nuclear propulsion is used primarily within naval warships such as nuclear submarines and supercarriers. A small number of experimental civil nuclear ships have been built.

Compared to oil- or coal-fuelled ships, nuclear propulsion offers the advantage of very long intervals of operation before refueling. All the fuel is contained within the nuclear reactor, so no cargo or supplies space is taken up by fuel, nor is space taken up by exhaust stacks or combustion air intakes. The low fuel cost is offset by high operating costs and investment in infrastructure, however, so nearly all nuclear-powered vessels are military.

==Power plants==

===Basic operation of naval ship or submarine===

Most naval nuclear reactors are of the pressurized water type, with the exception of a few attempts at using liquid sodium-cooled reactors. A primary water circuit transfers heat generated from nuclear fission in the fuel to a steam generator; this water is kept under pressure so it does not boil. This circuit operates at a temperature of around . Any radioactive contamination in the primary water is confined. Water is circulated by pumps; at lower power levels, reactors designed for submarines may rely on natural circulation of the water to reduce noise generated by the pumps.

The hot water from the reactor heats a separate water circuit in the steam generator. That water is converted to steam and passes through steam driers on its way to the steam turbine. Spent steam at low pressure runs through a condenser cooled by seawater and returns to liquid form. The water is pumped back to the steam generator and continues the cycle. Any water lost in the process can be made up by desalinated sea water added to the steam generator feed water.

In the turbine, the steam expands and reduces its pressure as it imparts energy to the rotating blades of the turbine. There may be many stages of rotating blades and fixed guide vanes. The output shaft of the turbine may be connected to a gearbox to reduce rotation speed, then a shaft connects to the vessel&#x27;s propellers. In another form of drive system, the turbine turns an electrical generator, and the electric power produced is fed to one or more drive motors for the vessel&#x27;s propellers. The Russian, U.S. and British navies rely on direct steam turbine propulsion, while French and Chinese ships use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion (turbo-electric transmission).

Some nuclear submarines have a single reactor, but Russian submarines have two, and so had . Most American aircraft carriers are powered by two reactors, but had eight. The majority of marine reactors are of the pressurized water type, although the U.S. and Soviet navies have designed warships powered with liquid metal cooled reactors.

===Differences from land power plants===
Marine-type reactors differ from land-based commercial electric power reactors in several respects.

While land-based reactors in nuclear power plants produce up to around 1600 megawatts of net electrical power (the nameplate capacity of the EPR), a typical marine propulsion reactor produces no more than a few hundred megawatts. Some small modular reactors (SMR) are similar to marine propulsion reactors in capacity and some design considerations and thus nuclear marine propulsion (whether civilian or military) is sometimes proposed as an additional market niche for SMRs. Unlike for land-based applications where hundreds of hectares can be occupied by installations like Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, at sea tight space limits dictate that a marine reactor must be physically small, so it must generate higher power per unit of space. This means its components are subject to greater stresses than those of a land-based reactor. Its mechanical systems must operate flawlessly under the adverse conditions encountered at sea, including vibration and the pitching and rolling of a ship operating in rough seas. Reactor shutdown mechanisms cannot rely on gravity to drop control rods into place as in a land-based reactor that always remains upright. Salt water corrosion is an additional problem that complicates maintenance.

As the core of a seagoing reactor is much smaller than a power reactor, the probability of a neutron intersecting with a fissionable nucleus before it escapes into the shielding is much lower. As such, the fuel is typically more highly enriched (i.e., contains a higher concentration of 235U vs. 238U) than that used in a land-based nuclear power plant, which increases the probability of fission to the level where a sustained reaction can occur. Some marine reactors run on relatively low-enriched uranium, which requires more frequent refueling. Others run on highly enriched uranium, varying from 20% 235U, to the over 96% 235U found in U.S. submarines, in which the resulting smaller core is quieter in operation (a big advantage to a submarine). Using more-highly enriched fuel also increases the reactor&#x27;s power density and extends the usable life of the nuclear fuel load, but is more expensive and a greater risk to nuclear proliferation than less-highly enriched fuel.

A marine nuclear propulsion plant must be designed to be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which might have to be undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements that will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-zirconium alloy rather than the ceramic UO2 (uranium dioxide) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a &quot;burnable poison&quot; in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the &quot;nuclear poison&quot; increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby extending the usable life of the fuel. The compact reactor pressure vessel is provided with an internal neutron shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant neutron bombardment.

==Decommissioning==
Decommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for U.S. and Russian navies. After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste (see the &quot;ship-submarine recycling program&quot;). In Russia, whole vessels, or sealed reactor sections, typically remain stored afloat, although a new facility near Sayda Bay is to provide storage in a concrete-floored facility on land for some submarines in the far north.

==Future designs==
Russia built a floating nuclear power plant for its far eastern territories. The design has two 35 MWe units based on the KLT-40 reactor used in icebreakers (with refueling every four years). Some Russian naval vessels have been used to supply electricity for domestic and industrial use in remote far eastern and Siberian towns.

In 2010, Lloyd&#x27;s Register was investigating the possibility of civilian nuclear marine propulsion and rewriting draft rules (see text under &quot;Merchant Ships&quot;).

==Civil liability==
Insurance of nuclear vessels is not like the insurance of conventional ships. The consequences of an accident could span national boundaries, and the magnitude of possible damage is beyond the capacity of private insurers. A special international agreement, the &quot;Brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships&quot;, developed in 1962, would have made signatory national governments liable for accidents caused by nuclear vessels under their flag but was never ratified owing to disagreement on the inclusion of warships under the convention. Nuclear reactors under United States jurisdiction are insured by the provisions of the Price–Anderson Act.

==Military nuclear ships==

By 1990, there were more nuclear reactors powering ships (mostly military) than there were generating electric power in commercial power plants worldwide.

Under the direction of U.S. Navy Captain (later Admiral) Hyman G. Rickover, the design, development and production of nuclear marine propulsion plants started in the United States in the 1940s. The first prototype naval reactor was constructed and tested at the Naval Reactor Facility at the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho (now called the Idaho National Laboratory) in 1953.

=== Submarines ===
The first nuclear submarine, , put to sea in 1955 (SS was a traditional hull classification symbol for U.S. submarines, while SSN denoted the first &quot;nuclear&quot; submarine).

The Soviet Union also developed nuclear submarines. The first types developed were the Project 627, NATO-designated with two water-cooled reactors, the first of which, K-3 &quot;Leninsky Komsomol&quot;, was underway under nuclear power in 1958.

Nuclear power revolutionized the submarine, finally making it a true &quot;underwater&quot; vessel, rather than a &quot;submersible&quot; craft, which could only stay underwater for limited periods. It gave the submarine the ability to operate submerged at high speeds, comparable to those of surface vessels, for unlimited periods, dependent only on the endurance of its crew. To demonstrate this was the first vessel to execute a submerged circumnavigation of the Earth (Operation Sandblast), doing so in 1960.

&quot;Nautilus&quot;, with a pressurized water reactor (PWR), led to the parallel development of other submarines like a unique liquid metal cooled (sodium) reactor in , or two reactors in &quot;Triton&quot;, and then the s, powered by single reactors, and a cruiser, , in 1961, powered by two reactors.

By 1962, the United States Navy had 26 operational nuclear submarines and another 30 under construction. Nuclear power had revolutionized the Navy. The United States shared its technology with the United Kingdom, while French, Soviet, Indian and Chinese development proceeded separately.

After the &quot;Skate&quot;-class vessels, U.S. submarines were powered by a series of standardized, single-reactor designs built by Westinghouse and General Electric. Rolls-Royce plc built similar units for Royal Navy submarines, eventually developing a modified version of their own, the PWR2.

The largest nuclear submarines ever built are the 26,500 tonne Russian . The smallest nuclear warships to date are the 2,700 tonne French attack submarines. The U.S. Navy operated an unarmed nuclear submarine, the NR-1 Deep Submergence Craft, between 1969 and 2008, which was not a combat vessel but was the smallest nuclear-powered submarine at 400 tons.

=== Aircraft carriers ===

The United States and France have built nuclear aircraft carriers.

==== French Navy ====

The sole French nuclear aircraft carrier example is , commissioned in 2001 (a successor is planned).

The French carrier is equipped with catapults and arresters. The has 42,000 tonnes, is the flagship of the French Navy (Marine Nationale). The ship carries a complement of Dassault Rafale M and E‑2C Hawkeye aircraft, EC725 Caracal and AS532 Cougar helicopters for combat search and rescue, as well as modern electronics and Aster missiles.

==== United States Navy ====
The United States Navy operates 11 carriers, all nuclear-powered:
*: in service 1962–2012, powered by eight reactor units, is still the only aircraft carrier to house more than two nuclear reactors, with each A2W reactor taking the place of one of the conventional boilers in earlier constructions.
*: ten 101,000-ton, 1,092 ft long fleet carriers, the first of which was commissioned in 1975. A &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carrier is powered by two nuclear reactors providing steam to four steam turbines.
*, one 110,000-ton, 1,106 ft long fleet carrier. The lead of the class , came into service in 2017, with another nine planned.

=== Destroyers and cruisers ===

==== Russian Navy ====

The &quot;Kirov&quot; class, Soviet designation &#x27;Project 1144 Orlan&#x27; (sea eagle), is a class of nuclear-powered guided-missile cruisers of the Soviet Navy and Russian Navy, the largest and heaviest surface combatant warships (i.e. not an aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship) in operation in the world. Among modern warships, they are second in size only to large aircraft carriers, and of similar size to World War II era battleships. The Soviet classification of the ship-type is &quot;heavy nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser&quot; (). The ships are often referred to as battlecruisers by Western defence commentators due to their size and general appearance.

==== United States Navy ====

The United States Navy at one time had nuclear-powered cruisers as part of its fleet. The first such ship was USS &quot;Long Beach&quot; (CGN-9). Commissioned in 1961, she was the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered surface combatant. She was followed a year later by USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot; (DLGN-25). While &quot;Long Beach&quot; was designed and built as a cruiser, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; began life as a frigate, though at that time the Navy was using the hull code &quot;DLGN&quot; for &quot;destroyer leader, guided missile, nuclear&quot;. 

The last nuclear-powered cruisers the Americans would produce would be the four-ship . was commissioned in 1976, followed by in 1977, in 1978 and finally in 1980. Ultimately, all these ships proved to be too costly to maintain and they were all retired between 1993 and 1999.

=== Other military ships ===

=== Communication and command ships ===

SSV-33 Ural (&quot;ССВ-33 Урал&quot;; NATO reporting name: &quot;Kapusta&quot; Russian for &quot;cabbage&quot;]) was a command and control naval ship operated by the Soviet Navy. &quot;SSV-33&quot;″s hull was derived from that of the nuclear-powered s with nuclear marine propulsion. &quot;SSV-33&quot; served in electronic intelligence, missile tracking, space tracking, and communications relay roles. Due to high operating costs, &quot;SSV-33&quot; was laid up.

&quot;SSV-33&quot; carried only light defensive weapons. These were two AK-176 76 mm guns, four AK-630 30 mm guns, and four quadruple Igla missile mounts.

=== Nuclear-powered UUV ===
The Poseidon (, &quot;Poseidon&quot;, NATO reporting name Kanyon), previously known by Russian codename Status-6 (), is a nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed unmanned underwater vehicle under development by Rubin Design Bureau, capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear payloads. According to Russian state TV, it is able to deliver a thermonuclear cobalt bomb of up to 200 megatonnes (four times as powerful as the most powerful device ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba, and twice its maximum theoretical yield) against an enemy&#x27;s naval ports and coastal cities.

==Civilian nuclear ships==

The following are ships that are or were in commercial or civilian use and have nuclear marine propulsion.

===Merchant ships===
Nuclear-powered civil merchant ships have not developed beyond a few experimental ships. The U.S.-built , completed in 1962, was primarily a demonstration of civil nuclear power and was too small and expensive to operate economically as a merchant ship. The design was too much of a compromise, being neither an efficient freighter nor a viable passenger liner. The German-built , completed in 1968, a cargo ship and research facility, sailed some on 126 voyages over 10 years without any technical problems. It proved too expensive to operate and was converted to diesel. The Japanese , completed in 1972, was dogged by technical and political problems. Its reactor had significant radiation leakage and fishermen protested against the vessel&#x27;s operation. All of these three ships used low-enriched uranium. &quot;Sevmorput&quot;, a Soviet and later Russian LASH carrier with icebreaking capability, has operated successfully on the Northern Sea Route since it was commissioned in 1988. , it is the only nuclear-powered merchant ship in service.

Civilian nuclear ships suffer from the costs of specialized infrastructure. The &quot;Savannah&quot; was expensive to operate since it was the only vessel using its specialized nuclear shore staff and servicing facility. A larger fleet could share fixed costs among more operating vessels, reducing operating costs.

Despite this, there is still interest in nuclear propulsion. In November 2010 British Maritime Technology and Lloyd&#x27;s Register embarked upon a two-year study with U.S.-based Hyperion Power Generation (now Gen4 Energy), and the Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading SA to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors. The research intended to produce a concept tanker-ship design, based on a 70 MWt reactor such as Hyperion&#x27;s. In response to its members&#x27; interest in nuclear propulsion, Lloyd&#x27;s Register has also re-written its &#x27;rules&#x27; for nuclear ships, which concern the integration of a reactor certified by a land-based regulator with the rest of the ship. The overall rationale of the rule-making process assumes that in contrast to the current marine industry practice where the designer/builder typically demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements, in the future the nuclear regulators will wish to ensure that it is the operator of the nuclear plant that demonstrates safety in operation, in addition to the safety through design and construction. Nuclear ships are currently the responsibility of their own countries, but none are involved in international trade. As a result of this work in 2014 two papers on commercial nuclear marine propulsion were published by Lloyd&#x27;s Register and the other members of this consortium. These publications review past and recent work in the area of marine nuclear propulsion and describe a preliminary concept design study for a Suezmax tanker that is based on a conventional hull form with alternative arrangements for accommodating a 70 MWt nuclear propulsion plant delivering up to 23.5 MW shaft power at maximum continuous rating (average: 9.75 MW). The Gen4Energy power module is considered. This is a small fast-neutron reactor using lead–bismuth eutectic cooling and able to operate for ten full-power years before refueling, and in service last for a 25-year operational life of the vessel. They conclude that the concept is feasible, but further maturity of nuclear technology and the development and harmonisation of the regulatory framework would be necessary before the concept would be viable.

Nuclear propulsion has been proposed again on the wave of decarbonization of marine shipping, which accounts for 3–4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

===Merchant cargo ships===
* USNS &quot;American Explorer&quot;; United States tanker, converted to conventional power while under construction
* , Japan (1970–1992); never carried commercial cargo, rebuilt as diesel engine powered &quot;RV Mirai&quot; in 1996
* , Germany (1968–1979); re-powered with diesel engine in 1979
* , United States (1962–1972)
* &quot;Sevmorput&quot;, Russia (1988–present), ice-strengthened nuclear-powered lighter aboard ship (LASH) carrier

In December 2023, the Jiangnan Shipyard under the China State Shipbuilding Corporation officially released a design of a 24000 TEU-class container ship — known as the KUN-24AP — at Marintec China 2023, a premier maritime industry exhibition held in Shanghai. The container ship is reported to be powered by a thorium-based molten salt reactor, making it a first thorium-powered container ship and, if completed, the largest nuclear-powered container ship in the world.

===Icebreakers===

Nuclear propulsion has proven both technically and economically feasible for nuclear-powered icebreakers in the Soviet, and later Russian, Arctic. Nuclear-fuelled ships operate for years without refueling, and the vessels have powerful engines, well-suited to the task of icebreaking.

The Soviet icebreaker &quot;Lenin&quot; was the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered surface vessel in 1959 and remained in service for 30 years (new reactors were fitted in 1970). It led to a series of larger icebreakers, the 23,500 ton of six vessels, launched beginning in 1975. These vessels have two reactors and are used in deep Arctic waters. NS &quot;Arktika&quot; was the first surface vessel to reach the North Pole.

For use in shallow waters such as estuaries and rivers, shallow-draft, &quot;Taymyr&quot;-class icebreakers were built in Finland and then fitted with their single-reactor nuclear propulsion system in Russia. They were built to conform to international safety standards for nuclear vessels.

All nuclear-powered icebreakers have been commissioned by the Soviet Union or Russia.

<text>Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a well-preserved fortress on a hill on the island of St. Kitts in the Federation of St. Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis in the Eastern Caribbean. It was designed by British military engineers, and was built and maintained by enslaved Africans. It is one of the best preserved historical fortifications in the Americas.

The complex of fortifications were constructed on Brimstone Hill, a very steeply sloping hill situated close to the sea on the Western, Caribbean coast of St. Kitts.

==Early history==

Cannon were first mounted on Brimstone Hill in 1689 during the Nine Years&#x27; War, by Jean-Baptiste du Casse, when the French used them to capture the English Fort Charles. The English, under Sir Christopher Codrington, used the same tactic to recapture the fort a year later. From then on, the English used the hill as a fortress, mounting 24-pound cannon, taking advantage of its 972-foot height.

In 1711 and 1731, lightning destroyed the gunpowder magazine. By 1736, the fort had 49 guns. Since 1795, 40 members of &quot;The St. Christopher Corps of Embodied Slaves&quot; served at the fort, armed with pikes and cutlasses.

By 1780, the fortress was considered impregnable, &quot;The Gibraltar of the Caribbean&quot;. On 11 Jan. 1782, the French under Admiral Comte François Joseph Paul de Grasse and François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé, laid siege to the fort. During the siege, the adjacent island of Nevis surrendered, and guns from Fort Charles and other small forts there were brought to St. Kitts for use against Brimstone Hill. British Admiral Hood could not dislodge de Grasse, and after a month of siege, the heavily outnumbered and cut-off British garrison surrendered. However, a year later, the Treaty of Paris (1783) restored St. Kitts and Brimstone Hill to British rule, along with the adjacent island of Nevis. Following these events, the British carried out a program to augment and strengthen the fortifications, and Brimstone Hill never again fell to an enemy force. The French navy tried to recapture the fort in 1806 but failed.

French Admiral Édouard Thomas Burgues de Missiessy raided the island and succeeded in blowing up the powder magazine in 1805. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the local militias throughout the Caribbean were disbanded in 1838.

The fort was abandoned by the British in 1853, and the militia disbanded in 1854. The structures gradually started to decay through vandalism and natural processes.

==20th century==
Stabilization and restoration of the remaining structures of the fortress started in the early 1900s. In 1973, Prince Charles reopened the first area to be completely restored, which was the Prince of Wales Bastion. In 1985, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a plaque naming Brimstone Hill as a National Park. Legislation in 1987 officially declared Brimstone Hill to be a National Park, and it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999.

==21st century==
Areas that can be toured on Brimstone Hill include the Fort George Citadel (which includes the Fort George Museum), the Western Place of Arms and the Eastern Place of Arms, all accessed via a steep walk up from the main parking area via a set of ramps and steps. Other areas include the Magazine Bastion that was breached by the French in 1782, ruins of the Royal Engineers&#x27; Quarters, ruins of the Artillery Officers&#x27; Quarters, Infantry Officers&#x27; Quarters, and the Orillon Bastion.

In 2019, King Charles III was given a tour of the fortress by local historian Leonard Stapleton.

<text>Aleksandr Stepanovich Antonov (26 July 1889 – 24 June 1922) () was a Russian revolutionary, member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and one of the leaders of the Tambov Rebellion against the Bolshevik regime.

== Early life ==
Antonov was born in Moscow in 1889 to Nataliia Ivanovna Sokolova and Stepan Gavrilovich Antonov, however his family moved to Kirsanov in his father&#x27;s native Tambov Governorate soon after his birth. Parish documents record the family as lower middle-class. In Kirsanov, Nataliia worked as a seamstress and milliner and Stepan, a former non-commissioned officer in the Russian army, worked as a tinker, although his business was unsuccessful. Antonov had two elder sisters, Valentina and Anna, and a younger brother . As a teenager he worked for a local grain trader. His mother died when he was about 16 years old. He had moved out of home by the time Stepan and Dimitri moved to Inzhavino in 1907 or 1908.
== Entry into politics ==
It is unknown exactly when Antonov became involved in radical politics. At some point he joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party. He first appears on police records as a known revolutionary in 1908, when he travelled to Tambov to establish connections between his group and the Tambov Socialist Revolutionaries. Antonov became an &quot;expropriator&quot;, someone who carried out robberies to support the revolutionary cause (called &quot;expropriations&quot; by revolutionaries). Antonov is associated with the robbery of a railway station in Inzhavino, where a note was left stating the exact amount taken &quot;by the party of anarchists-individualists&quot;, signed by &quot;a member of the party&quot;. He was also involved in the robbery of a bank in Kaninskii, where the amount taken was entered into the accounts book as being confiscated by &quot;the Volga Union of Independent Socialist-Revolutionaries&quot;.

On 20 February 1909, Antonov was arrested in Saratov, during an investigation into a plot to assassinate the commander-in-chief of the Kazan region, General Sadetskii. He does not appear to have been involved in this plot, but was imprisoned for his involvement in robberies. He was given 20 years of katorga, spending the first part of his sentence in the Schlisselburg fortress and the rest in Vladimirsky Central.

== February Revolution and the Kirsanov Republic ==
In February 1917, Antonov was released from prison by the amnesty for political prisoners proclaimed by the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution. He initially stayed with his sister Valentina in the city of Tambov, taking around a month to recover his health from his time in prison. Antonov began working for the Militia, the new law enforcement organisation replacing the Tsarist Police. He had useful connections in the political circumstances, for instance his defence lawyer from his trial in 1910, V. P. Isheev, was now Chair of the Tambov Municipal Duma.

On May 13, the Duma representatives of Kirsanov declared the town to be an independent republic. A leading figure in this was the businessman A. K. Trunin, who declared himself &quot;Procurer-General&quot;. This was not the result of a popular movement, unrelated to other declarations of local republics in provincial towns or the seizure of land from estates. The political nature of the &quot;Kirsanov Republic&quot; is unclear besides its opposition to the Provisional Government, with various sources calling it &quot;bourgeois&quot;, &quot;anarchist&quot;, &quot;bolshevik&quot; or &quot;blackhundred&quot;. Antonov was chosen to lead a contingent of Militia to arrest the leaders of this &quot;republic&quot;. Antonov&#x27;s men encountered a large crowd outside the municipal Duma building in Kirsanov, their attempt to arrest Trunin was resisted and eventually led to a shootout. The &quot;republicans&quot; surrendered, but a crowd assailed Antonov&#x27;s group and freed them, simultaneously arresting Antonov. The local army garrison intervened to arrest Trunin and restore order, however the incident had led to 8 deaths.

In October, officials of the Kirsanov uezd requested that Antonov be made head of the uezd Militia. Around this time Antonov married his girlfriend, Sofiia Vasil&#x27;evna Orlova-Bogoliubskaia. Sofiia&#x27;s brother Aleksandr also had connections to Kirsanov, and similarly to Antonov had been involved in &quot;expropriations&quot; before the revolution. Antonov left his new wife in Tambov to take up his new appointment in Kirsanov.

== October Revolution, Tambov Rebellion and death ==
When the Bolsheviks seized power in November, there was no Bolshevik presence in the Kirsanov, where the Duma was dominated by liberals and moderate Socialists and the Soviet by Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. There was a gradual transfer of power from the Duma to the Soviet. The Bolshevik presence in Kirsanov began to grow as Bolshevik-supporting soldiers returned from World War I, and the Bolshevik regime began to impose its control on the countryside. A branch of the Cheka was founded in Kirsanov in April 1918. Non-Bolshevik officials like Antonov were placed under pressure to align themselves with the regime or leave their posts. It is known that Antonov eventually joined the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who were initially aligned with the Bolshevik regime, however he had little involvement in their party implying this was probably a pragmatic decision to keep his position.

In Kirsanov he organised and became one of the leaders of the Tambov Rebellion against the Bolshevik regime. On 24 June 1922, cornered by a Cheka detachment near the village of Shybriay near Borisoglebsk, he was killed in a firefight along with his brother, Dmitriy. Documents state that he fought to the end, never laying down his weapon. Antonov was buried in Tambov, along with the other members of his group and his brother Dmitriy, near the walls of the monastery Kazan Mother of God on the fifth day after he perished.

<text>Philip or Filip () was King of Sweden from c. 1105–1110 until 1118.

Philip was a son of King Halsten Stenkilsson and nephew of King Inge the Elder. Philip and his brother Inge the Younger ruled together from 1105 or 1110 and onwards as successors of their uncle King Inge the Elder. According to the records of the Westrogothic law (&quot;Västgötalagen&quot;) he was a good king. Little else is known about him. Hardly any other Swedish king who was the undisputed ruler of the kingdom after the Christianization is less known than Philip.

According to the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, he ruled only for a short time and was married to Ingegard, the daughter of the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada. Philip was probably buried with his brother Inge in Vreta Abbey (&quot;Vreta kloster och kyrka&quot;) at Linköping in Östergötland, Sweden.

Other sources say that after the death of Philip (1118), Inge the Younger was the sole king of Sweden, but the year of his own death is unknown. According to the regnal list in the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;, Inge was poisoned with an evil drink in Östergötland:
Niunði war Ingi konongær, broðher Philipusær konongs, oc heter æptir Ingæ kononge, Halstens konongs brødhær. Hanum war firigiort mæð ondom dryk i Østrægøtlanði, oc fek aff þy banæ. Æn Sweriki for e wæl, mædhæn þer frænlingær rædhu.

The tenth (Christian king) was king Inge, the brother of king Philip, and he was named after king Inge (the Elder). He was killed by evil drink in Östergötland and it was his bane. But Sweden fared forever well, while these kinsmen ruled.
It is not known whether Inge was still alive when the Norwegian king Sigurd I of Norway invaded Småland in the Kalmar Crusade in 1123, but when Inge died, it was the end of the House of Stenkil.

Inge is reported to have been married to Ulvhild Håkansdotter who was the daughter of the Norwegian Haakon Finnsson and who would later marry the Danish king Nils Svensson and even later the Swedish king Sverker the Elder. A story that has her assassinating King Inge with a poisoned beverage cannot be substantiated. According to another tradition, he was also the husband of Ragnhild of Tälje.

<text>The Santer Commission was the European Commission in office between 23 January 1995 and 15 March 1999. The administration was led by Jacques Santer (former Prime Minister of Luxembourg).

The body had 20 members and oversaw the introduction of the euro. It was cut short when the Commission became the first to resign &quot;en masse&quot;, owing to allegations of corruption. Some members continued under Manuel Marín until the Prodi Commission was appointed.

==Appointment==
In 1994, Jacques Delors was due to step down from a successful tenure as President of the European Commission. However, his federalist style was not to the liking of many national governments. Hence, when Jean-Luc Dehaene (the then Prime Minister of Belgium) was nominated as his successor, he was vetoed by the UK on the grounds he was too federalist. Jacques Santer, then-Prime Minister of Luxembourg, was seen as less federalist, for his presidency had earlier proposed the pillar structure. Hence, he was nominated and approved by the European Council on 15 July 1994.

Being seen as the &quot;second choice&quot; weakened Santer&#x27;s position, with the European Parliament approving him only by a narrow majority. He himself admitted that he &quot;was not the first choice – but to become Commission president was not my first choice either.&quot; He did, however, flex his powers over the nominations for the other Commissioners. The President gained this power under the Maastricht Treaty that came into force the previous year. On 18 January 1995, he got his Commission approved by Parliament by 416 votes to 103 (a larger majority than expected) and they were appointed by the council on 23 January.

==Early work==
The Santer Commission oversaw the development of the Treaty of Nice before it was signed in 2000, negotiations with those countries to join in 2004 and the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997.

Notably it contributed to the development of the euro and issued a series of green papers based on Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy&#x27;s work. The commission also developed the euro currency symbol. The euro was established on 1999-01-01. The commission also continued Delors&#x27;s social agenda, pushed for more powers in that field including tackling unemployment and began proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.

Santer, desiring a quotable slogan for his administration, stated his Commissions aim would be &quot;to do less, but do it better&quot; (a slogan adopted and adapted by many since). Although just a sound bite, it struck a chord for some thinking the Community needed a rest after the new treaties and the euro, even if the nature of the Community itself requires movements and new projects to keep it busy. However, during 1998 the commission began to lose authority due to management criticisms from the Parliament.

==Budget controversy==
The community&#x27;s budget for each year needs to be discharged by the Parliament following its report by the European Court of Auditors. It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984. Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the community&#x27;s budget for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement. Paul van Buitenen, a whistle-blower working in the commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: &quot;I found strong indications that . . . auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations . . . The commission is a closed culture and they want to keep it that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs – and that&#x27;s in the democratically-elected European Parliament.&quot; In response, the Commission suspended him on half pay for releasing details of an inquiry.

However it eventually supported the discharge 14 to 13 on 11 December, recommending that the plenary support the discharge. It was taken to plenary for debate four days later however the assigned rapporteur publicly went against the committee&#x27;s official position and urged the plenary to reject the discharge motion. President Santer announced that the commission would treat the vote of discharge as one of confidence. In a vote on 17 December 1998, the Parliament denied the discharge.

In response, on the basis it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence, the President of the intra-national Party of European Socialists (PES), Pauline Green, announced she would put forward a motion of censure. However the PES would vote against its own motion, as there is no method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with the PES as a party supporting the commission and the intra-national European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) renouncing its support and acting as a &quot;de facto&quot; opposition party to the executive. This was in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the EPP to discredit the PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (only censuring those who the main allegations were against) and the PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.

==Resignation==
Following negotiations, including national governments pressuring their MEPs, the Parliament met to vote on the resolutions on 14 January 1999. It accepted the PES resolution and turned down a censure motion 293 to 232. A &quot;Committee of Independent Experts&quot; was set up with its members appointed by the political leaders in Parliament and the commission. A number of high-profile figures were appointed and President Santer agreed to &quot;respond&quot; to its findings. The report was produced on 15 March 1999 and was presented to the Commission and Parliament. It largely cleared most members, aside from Cresson, but concluded that there was growing reluctance of the Commissioners to acknowledge responsibility and that &quot;It was becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone who had the slightest sense of responsibility.&quot;
In response to the report, the PES withdrew their support from the Commission and joined the other groups stating that unless the Commission resigned of its own accord, it would be forced to do so. So, on the night of 15 March, Santer announced the mass resignation of his Commission. The morning following the resignation, against the recommendation of his advisors, Santer attacked the conclusions of Committee. The report was seen to be even in criticising not only PES members but also the workings of the Commission itself. It also exposed the situation that neither Parliament, nor the President, could force the resignation of individual Commissioners as they could only be &#x27;recalled&#x27; by national governments. The French government refused to recall Cresson, who refused to resign of her own accord, which sparked the need for a mass resignation. Commissioner Mario Monti criticised this, stating that &quot;This Commission has collectively resigned, I believe, not because of collective responsibility but because certain members of it preferred not to take their own individual responsibilities.&quot; Édith Cresson went before the European Court of Justice and, in July 2006, was found guilty but was not stripped of her pension. Cresson today is largely held accountable for the fall of Santer (who went on to serve as an MEP and never fully recovered), and the rest of his Commission.

==Repercussions==
The immediate effect was that the politically weakened Commission was unable to react to the beginning of the Kosovo War and the close of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament&#x27;s legislative power, the council&#x27;s foreign policy role and the ECB&#x27;s financial role. However the change with Parliament was the most profound, the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power.

It was hoped by the leaders in Parliament that such a political challenge would generate useful publicity ahead of the elections, with previous polls producing a low turn out with a perception of the body being powerless. In this respect the affair did generate extensive media attention with the Parliament now seeming &#x27;dramatic&#x27;. The committee report also was written in an unusually accessible manner, filled with soundbites. Further more it also drew greater attention from the council to a Parliament willing to exercise its powers. Hence when the Council came in to agree on a new president, it was clear that the candidate had to be acceptable to parliament. The crisis also displayed the increasing party competition within the Parliament, leading to the development of a Parliamentary system between the executive and legislative branches. Indeed, it can be seen that the government-opposition dynamic of the two main parties in Parliament aggravated the development of the crisis and contributed to the downfall of the commission.

The Prodi Commission, which succeeded Marín&#x27;s caretaker administration, announced a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. Following pressure from Parliament, the Commission quickly established OLAF, an anti-fraud office which replaced the Unit for the Co-ordination of Fraud Protection (UCLAF) established in 1988 and seen as having failed in its duty. OLAF was established with more powers and to be more independent, especially in terms of investigation where they are formally autonomous from the commission. There were a few members who survived the Santer Commission to continue under Prodi: Franz Fischler, Erkki Liikanen, Mario Monti and Neil Kinnock. The latter was appointed to undertake institutional reform.

The reappointment of some of these members showed that individual Commissioners still maintained their own reputations despite the massive loss of face of the institution as a whole, while Cresson would have never been able to have been reappointed. The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the commission&#x27;s powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the commission&#x27;s powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.

==College==
The Commission college had 20 members (two for the largest five member states, one each for the remainder) and included Commissioners from new member states Sweden, Finland and Austria. Had Norway not rejected EU membership in 1995, their Commissioner would have been Thorvald Stoltenberg who was proposed as Commissioner for Fisheries;

<doc id="917003" wikidata="Q141267" url="?curid=917003" title="Aleurites">
<text>Aleurites is a small genus of arborescent flowering plants in the Euphorbiaceae, first described as a genus in 1776. It is native to China, the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Papuasia, and Queensland. It is also reportedly naturalized on various islands (Pacific and Indian Oceans, plus the Caribbean) as well as scattered locations in Africa, South America, and Florida.

These monoecious, evergreen trees are perennials or semiperennials. These are large trees, tall, with spreading, drooping, and rising branches.

The leaves are alternate, lobate, ovate to ovate-lanceolate with minute stipules. They are pubescent on both sides when young, but in a later stage they become glabrous.

The inflorescence consists of terminal plumes of small, creamy white, bell-shaped, fragrant flowers, branching from the base. The flowers are usually bisexual, with a solitary pistillate flower at the end of each major axis. The lateral cymes are staminate. There are five or six imbricate petals. The staminate flowers are mostly longer and thinner than the pistillate flowers, with 17–32 glabrous stamens in four whorls. The pistillate flowers have a superior ovary.

The fruits are rather large drupes with a fleshy exocarp and a thin, woody endocarp. They vary in shape, according to the numbers of developed locules. They contain oleiferous, poisonous seeds.

The oil has been used as a paraffin and lubricant, and as a constituent of varnish, paint, and soap. Once poisonous substances are removed, it can be used as a cooking oil.

Some deciduous Chinese species are now classified under a separate genus &quot;Vernicia&quot;.

The name &quot;Aleurites&quot; is derived from the meaning &quot;wheaten flour&quot; or &quot;ground meal&quot;, because of the appearance of the lower surface of the leaf.

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
Linnaeus assigned the Latin feminine grammatical gender to the genus name &quot;Aleurites&quot;, as for example in the species name &quot;Aleurites moluccana&quot;. The current International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants has standardized all genus names ending in &quot;-ites&quot; to use the masculine gender, so the correct name of the species &quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;.

== Species ==
Accepted species

The most widespread species is the candlenut (&quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;), occurring from tropical Asia and the Pacific, from India to China and Polynesia, Australia and New Zealand. Some botanists only recognize two species, &quot;A. moluccanus&quot; and &quot;A. rockinghamensis&quot;.

# &quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot; – Indian walnut, candlenut tree, country walnut, &quot;aburagiri, ama&quot; - most of genus range
# &quot;Aleurites rockinghamensis&quot; - Papua New Guinea, Queensland

;formerly included
moved to other genera: &quot;Croton, Mallotus, Omphalea, Reutealis, Vernicia&quot;

<doc id="917004" wikidata="Q1342231" url="?curid=917004" title="Ragnvald Knaphövde">
<text>Ragnvald Knaphövde was a King of Sweden whose reign is estimated to have occurred in the mid-1120s or c. 1130. His cognomen &quot;Knaphövde&quot; is explained as referring to a drinking vessel, the size of a man&#x27;s head or meaning &quot;round head&quot; and referring to his being foolish. Ragnvald is mentioned in the regnal list of the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot; as the successor of King Inge the Younger.
His parentage is uncertain: King Inge the Elder of Sweden had a son named Ragnvald, and historian Sven Tunberg has suggested him as identical with Ragnvald Knaphövde. However, another tradition presents King Ragnvald as the son of an Olof Näskonung (&quot;Neskonungr&quot; meant &quot;king of a ness&quot; or &quot;petty king&quot;, in Old Norse), and the regnal list of the Westrogothic law does not mention that Ragnvald had any connection with the old line of kings.

==Election and assassination==
Ragnvald Knaphövde had been elected king by the Swedes in Uppland and then acknowledged by the East Gothlanders in Östergötland on his Eriksgata, but when he entered Västergötland, he did so without taking Geatish hostages. In Karleby near Falköping, he was murdered by the Geats who instead had elected the Danish prince Magnus Nielsen as the king.

The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus explained later in the same century that the election of Magnus and the murder of a rightful king of Sweden was part of a Gothic (Geatish) plan to arrogate the right of electing the king from the Swedes:
In the following century, in the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;, the Geats would acknowledge that it was the Swedes who were entitled to elect and depose the king. In the regnal list of this law, they ignored the existence of any Magnus, but instead they defended the murder of Ragnvald as follows:
Thus, the Geats explained the murder of Ragnvald as vengeance for his arrogant attitude towards them. After the death of King Magnus, the West Gothland region was ruled by jarls, probably under the nominal supremacy of Danish kings during a few decades until the Swedish king Sverker the Elder and after him the Swedish king Erik Jedvardsson were accepted there. 
The 16th-century Swedish King John III would later have a damaged tombstone replaced for Ragnvald, over a grave at Vreta Abbey. This is considered the family grave of King Inge the Elder, named for that king&#x27;s son mentioned above.
