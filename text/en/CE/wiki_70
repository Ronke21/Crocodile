<text>EMI-Capitol Special Markets was an EMI subsidiary handling distribution for special markets. It bought 3C Records in the early nineties.

It later operated as EMI Music Marketing and EMI Music Distribution in North America but have since been absorbed into Universal Music Enterprises after Universal Music Group acquired EMI recorded music division (including most of North American assets) while UMG divested selected EMI assets (such as Parlophone and Roulette Records) to Warner Music Group and those assets are now managed in North America by Rhino Entertainment.

<text>Manningham is a historically industrial workers area as well as a council ward of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England.
The population of the 2011 Census for the Manningham Ward was 19,983.

== History ==

Manningham holds a wealth of industrial history, including mill buildings, imposing wool merchants&#x27; houses and back-to-back terraced houses.
It is the old Jewish area of Bradford. Many of Manningham&#x27;s German community later migrated to the Heaton area of the city.

=== Cinema history ===

In 1912 the Manningham Kinematograph Company Ltd opened the 519 seat Oak Lane Picture House on a site on the north side of Oak Lane between St Mary&#x27;s Road and Sunderland Road.
The cinema was a converted horse tramshed of the Bradford Tramways and Omnibus Co Ltd.
The name was changed to Oriental in 1920 and by 1931 Western Electric sound had been installed.
The building closed in 1936 for a partial rebuild involving a new roof, balcony, and an enlarged screen, and the cinema reopened in 1937.
A Hammond organ was subsequently installed but was removed at the start of the Second World War.
In 1955 a CinemaScope screen was installed with stereophonic sound, but the cinema closed in 1958.
The building was subsequently demolished and a mini-supermarket built on the site.

The purpose-built 1,250 seat Marlboro Cinema was located at the junction of Carlisle Road and Carlisle Street and opened in 1921.
The building was designed by architect TÂ Patrick and is built of red brick with a white tiled entrance and domed tower.
It was owned by Moulson&#x27;s Marlboro Cinema Company headed by Milton Moulson.
Sound films were shown by 1930, and the number of seats was reduced to 1227 in 1944.
Walter Eckert&#x27;s Star Cinemas (London) Ltd acquired the cinema in 1950 and installed Western Electric sound.
It had a panoramic screen from 1954, but stereo sound was never installed.
Bingo was introduced on a part-time basis but the cinema closed fully in 1962 with bingo continuing full-time until 1968.
From 1962 to 1982 it was known as the Liberty Cinema showing Asian films for the growing local South Asian population. After closure and removal of the raked floor and balcony the building became a bedding and textile warehouse.
After a major refurbishment by Asian Cine Ltd in 2000, the cinema - now reduced to 400 seats - showed Bollywood films.
In 2001 a blaze wrecked the cinema, and its fire-damaged part was rebuilt as an Asian Marriage Hall and function room.

The former Manningham Methodist Church off Carlisle Road was converted into the Sangeet Cinema opening in 1970 which showed Asian films.
The former church building was very large and also housed numerous Asian businesses.
The Naz was a smaller cinema created at the rear of the building which was only used occasionally.
The Sangeet closed in 1980, and a series of fires struck the building in the 1980s, after which the whole building was demolished.

=== Deprivation ===

Manningham was the location of the Manningham riot (June 1995) and the Bradford Riots (July 2001).
In April 1994, &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper reported that unemployment in Manningham stood at 40% (around four times the national average at the time), and that a large number of known drug users and alcoholics lived there.

== Geography ==

The area usually termed &quot;Manningham&quot; tends to be that bordered by Manningham Lane to the east, Thornton Road (B6145) to the south-west, and Oak Lane to the north.

However, this is historically inaccurate as it also encompasses places such as White Abbey, Black Abbey, or Longlands in addition to the historic Manningham.
The use of those place names has persisted with the creation of administrative units such as the Manningham Ward.

=== Streets ===

Manningham Lane, part of the A650, stretches from Hamm Strasse to Lister Park (also known as Manningham Park) where it becomes Keighley Road.
It is a busy road in terms of both traffic and commerce, lined with shops and businesses for practically its entire length.

White Abbey Road - which becomes Whetley Hill at the junction with Whetley Lane and Carlisle Road - part of the B6144, is similarly active, with several large clothing outlets and jewellery shops.

Lumb Lane, running parallel to and between Manningham Lane and White Abbey Road, is the home to many independent shops, mainly catering to the local South Asian community.
There are also several pubs and South Asian restaurants.

Recent actions by the Bradford Council and local community groups have helped in starting to improve the area.

=== Districts ===

==== White Abbey ====

White Abbey is a historic district on the north-western edge of Bradford city centre.
Its boundaries are roughly the equivalent of White Abbey Road to the west and south, Lumb Lane to the east and Carlisle Road to the north.
Like many of the older districts of inner-city Bradford, White Abbey was once a vibrant and highly populated neighbourhood.
Today the area is dominated by social housing. 

== Demography ==
Manningham has a large British Pakistani population. Looking at electoral register data in 1964, around 6.7% of Manningham was Pakistani/Indian. In 1971, 24.8% of Manningham was Asian Pakistani.

== Landmarks ==

The dominant landmark for the entire city is Lister Mills. The mills stand on the most elevated part of Manningham, at the top of Oak Lane (more accurately, on the corner of Lilycroft and Heaton Roads).

The mills have been converted into luxury modern flats. Another former prominent textile factory, Drummond Mill, was destroyed in a fire in January 2018 and has largely been demolished.
Bradford Reform Synagogue is situated in Manningham and is a Grade II listed Moorish Revival building.
Architecturally, this is a very rare and well-preserved, small scale, provincial synagogue built in &quot;Oriental&quot; style. It is considered a significant example in British synagogue architecture of the 19th century fashion for &quot;Orientalism&quot;.
The Bradford Reform Synagogue is the oldest Reform Synagogue in the UK outside London.

Another key landmark is Lister Park.
This triangular park, situated between Keighley Road, North Park Road and Emm Lane in the north of Manningham, is one of the city&#x27;s largest parks.
It houses Cartwright Hall (a museum and art gallery), a large boating lake and the Mughal Water Gardens as well as extensive botanical gardens.

Bradford Grammar School is situated at the northern edge of Manningham between Lister Park and Canal Road, bordering Frizinghall. The school was founded in 1548 and granted its Charter by King Charles II in 1662.
It has occupied its current location since after World War II.

== Governance ==

;Councillors
Manningham electoral ward is represented on Bradford Council by three Labour Party councillors, Shabir Hussain, Sameena Akhtar and Sarfraz Nazir.

Manningham was formerly a township in the parish of Bradford, in 1866 Manningham became a separate civil parish, on 25 March 1898 the parish was abolished and merged with Bradford. In 1891 the parish had a population of 45,051.

== Sport ==

Manningham is also the location of Valley Parade football stadium, which has been the home of Bradford City football club since they were founded in 1903 and where Bradford RLFC played in recent years while Odsal Stadium was redeveloped.
In 1985 the Valley Parade ground was the site of a fire which killed 56 spectators and injured at least 265 at the final game of the season against Lincoln City.
The incident led to improved safety regulations at British sports grounds.
As was once common with English football stadiums, the stadium takes its name from the road on which it is situated, Valley Parade being the name of a road that slopes down the valley off the A650 towards Bradford Beck.

== Notable people ==

Gertie Millar, Countess of Dudley, the music hall actress, was born in Manningham, as was J. B. Priestley. The Australian women&#x27;s rights activist Erna Laura Keighley was born here in 1891.

Former pupils of Bradford Grammar School include Denis Healey, Sir Ken Morrison, David Hockney and David Miliband.

<doc id="925962" wikidata="Q349294" url="?curid=925962" title="Hungary at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Hungary competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Hungarian athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era, except the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles because of the Soviet boycott. The Hungarian Olympic Committee (, &quot;MOB&quot;) sent a total of 209 athletes to the Games, 119 men and 90 women, to compete in 20 sports. Water polo and handball were the only team-based sports in which Hungary had its representation in these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in road cycling and mountain biking.

The Hungarian team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney, including the men&#x27;s water polo team (led by Tibor Benedek), Ã©pÃ©e fencer TÃ­mea Nagy, sprint kayakers ZoltÃ¡n Kammerer, GyÃ¶rgy Kolonics (who later died in 2008 due to heart failure), and Katalin KovÃ¡cs, and breaststroke and medley swimmer Ãgnes KovÃ¡cs. Table tennis player Csilla BÃ¡torfi became the first female Hungarian athlete to compete in five Olympic Games as one of the most sophisticated members of the team. Along with Kolonics and Benedek, six Hungarian athletes had made their fourth Olympic appearance, including fencer IvÃ¡n KovÃ¡cs and half-heavyweight judoka Antal KovÃ¡cs, who was assigned by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Race walker ZoltÃ¡n Czukor, aged 41, was the oldest member of the team, while backstroke swimmer Evelyn VerrasztÃ³ was the youngest at age 15.

Hungary left Athens with a total of 17 Olympic medals, 8 golds, 6 silver, and 3 bronze, matching its overall tally with Sydney four years earlier. Almost a third of these medals were awarded to the athletes in sprint canoeing, three in fencing, and two in swimming. Skeet shooter DiÃ¡na Igaly and modern pentathlete Zsuzsanna VÃ¶rÃ¶s won Olympic gold medals for the first time in their respective sporting events by a female. Meanwhile, Nagy managed to repeat her gold from Sydney in women&#x27;s Ã©pÃ©e fencing. Hungary&#x27;s team-based athletes proved particularly successful in Athens, as the men&#x27;s water polo team had fulfilled a mission to defend their eighth overall Olympic title.

Originally, Hungary had won 20 Olympic medals at these Games. Four Hungarian medalists had been disqualified from the Games for committing an anti-doping violation, two of which were Olympic champions in track and field. On August 25, 2004, discus thrower RÃ³bert Fazekas failed to submit a proper urine sample during the test, and was not allowed to present his gold in the medal ceremony. At the conclusion of the Games, the International Olympic Committee decided to strip off AdriÃ¡n Annus&#x27; gold medal in men&#x27;s hammer throw for failing to show up in the doping test.

==Medalists==

==Athletics==

Hungarian athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

RÃ³bert Fazekas and AdriÃ¡n Annus originally claimed gold medals in both men&#x27;s discus and hammer throw. On August 25, 2004, a few hours before the medal ceremony had taken place, Fazekas committed an anti-doping violation by failing to submit a proper urine sample during the test, and was eventually expelled from the Games. Meanwhile, at the conclusion of the Games, the International Olympic Committee stripped off Annus&#x27; Olympic title after failing the doping test.

<text>Song Bird Records (also known as SongBird Records) was started at the end of 1963 as a gospel music subsidiary of Houston, Texas-based Duke/Peacock Records. Significant artists on Song Bird included the powerful contralto Inez Andrews formerly of The Caravans, The Gospelettes with Liz Dargan formerly of The Andrewettes, mixed-vocal group The Kansas City Melodyaires later known as Mildred Clark &amp; The Melodyaires, The Dallas Academy Youth Choir, The Jackson Southernaires along with their younger siblings The Williams Brothers, Reverend Oris Mays, and the Christian Harmonizers.

Song Bird also featured the one-off album, &quot;It&#x27;s Gospel Time&quot;, by The Sons of The Birds, being the sons of the famous Peacock group, The Dixie Hummingbirds. Andrews scored a small hit on the rhythm and blues singles charts in April 1973 with the title track of her album, &quot;Lord Donât Move The Mountain&quot;. That same year, the Duke/Peacock family of labels â which also included Back Beat and Sure Shot â was sold to Los Angeles, California-based label, ABC Records, with ABC label founder, Don Robey, staying with ABC as a consultant until his death in 1975. In 1974, Song Bird&#x27;s label name was changed to ABC/Songbird.

After ABC was sold to MCA Records in 1979, MCA briefly operated an MCA/Songbird label with new signings including Little Anthony of Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials and Dan Peek formerly of the group, America, the previous rosters of both ABC/Peacock and ABC/Songbird having been dropped. MCA would later reissue several Peacock and Song Bird/Songbird albums. Along with the MCA back catalog, the Peacock and Song Bird masters are now controlled by the Geffen Records unit of Universal Music Group.

<text>Lambton Castle stands above Chester-le-Street, County Durham and is a stately home, the ancestral seat of the Lambton family, the Earls of Durham. It is listed in the mid-category of listed building, Grade II*.

==History==
Largely constructed as it is between 1820 and 1828 by John Lambton, first Earl of Durham and one-time Governor General of Canada, it was built around Harraton Hall, a 17th-century mansion. The castle was designed by architects Joseph Bonomi the Elder and his son Ignatius and built in the style of a Norman castle, as was the fashion of the time.

Later additions to the house built by Sydney Smirke in 1862â65, including the great hall, were largely demolished in 1932. The structure had suffered from subsidence. In the 1930s the family moved to the smaller Biddick Hall on the estate.

The park that surrounds the castle is bordered by a high wall. The family keep going its annual pheasant shoot. The grounds from 1972 until 1980 accommodated a venture which closed, Lambton Lion Park.

Later the family have sold Biddick Woods enabling a link road from the A182 to the A690 in Houghton-le-Spring and new business units.

In 2012, the castle was the setting of the BBC One drama &quot;The Paradise&quot;.

On 30 December 2015 plans for the estate&#x27;s development were submitted to the local planning authority to help fund park upkeep and conservation, with a vision to turn the castle into a wedding venue, boutique hotel or both, aiming to spend Â£26 million to Â£28.5 million on building and labour. The plans were submitted by the Trustees of Lord Durhamâs 1989 Voluntary Settlement, which manages the estate on behalf of the family.

<doc id="925971" wikidata="Q3439752" url="?curid=925971" title="Blue Thumb Records">
<text>Blue Thumb Records was an American record label founded in 1968 by Bob Krasnow and former A&amp;M Records executives Tommy LiPuma and Don Graham. Blue Thumb&#x27;s last record was released in 1978. In 1995, the label was revived and remained active until 2005.

==History==
Bob Krasnow had been in the record business since the 1950s, working as a promotion man for King Records and also working for Buddah/Kama Sutra Records. Blue Thumb was originally intended by Captain Beefheart to be the name of his backing band. However, Krasnow did not think the name was right for the group. Later Krasnow chose the name for his label.

Other acts that appeared on the label include Phil Upchurch, Ben Sidran, Last Poets, Gerry Rafferty, The Credibility Gap, The Crusaders, Hugh Masekela, Sam Lay, Sylvester, Southwind, Robbie Basho, Tom Rapp, Aynsley Dunbar&#x27;s Retaliation (licensed from UK Liberty Records), Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks, Jimmy Smith, Dave Mason, The Pointer Sisters, The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils, T. Rex (in its earlier incarnation as Tyrannosaurus Rex, licensed from the UK&#x27;s Regal Zonophone Records), Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Love, GÃ¡bor SzabÃ³, Mark-Almond, Modereko, and National Lampoon (on the Banana label imprint).

Blue Thumb originally used independent distribution, but went to Capitol/EMI for distribution in late 1970. Gulf and Western&#x27;s Famous Music Group took over distribution in mid-1971, then bought the label outright in 1972. Late in 1974, the Famous Music record labels were sold to ABC Records. ABC kept Blue Thumb active for a time, mostly for albums by the Pointer Sisters and the Crusaders as well as some reissues. In 1979 ABC sold its labels to MCA Records, which discontinued the Blue Thumb imprint altogether.

In the United Kingdom and Europe, Blue Thumb releases were licensed to Harvest Records (also owned by EMI) from 1969 to 1971, and to Island Records thereafter. In 1995, an anthology CD was released, &quot;All Day Thumbsucker Revisited: The History of Blue Thumb Records&quot;, consisting of recordings from various artists from 1968 to 1974.

The label was revived in 1995 for blues and soft rock releases. This remained so, even after the 1998 merger with parent Universal Music Group and PolyGram and being put under the fold of the Verve Music Group, continuing to be Verve&#x27;s imprint for non-jazz releases. In early 2005, the Blue Thumb imprint was deactivated and was replaced with Verve Forecast to handle such releases. UMG&#x27;s reissue arm Hip-O Records has reissued several Blue Thumb recordings, including such acts as the Crusaders, Dan Hicks &amp; his Hot Licks and the Pointer Sisters.

<doc id="925974" wikidata="Q243130" url="?curid=925974" title="Olivia Manning">
<text>Olivia Mary Manning (2 March 1908Â âÂ 23 July 1980) was a British novelist, poet, writer, and reviewer. Her fiction and non-fiction, frequently detailing journeys and personal odysseys, were principally set in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle East. She often wrote from her personal experience, though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing. Her books are widely admired for her artistic eye and vivid descriptions of place.

Manning&#x27;s youth was divided between Portsmouth and Ireland, giving her what she described as &quot;the usual Anglo-Irish sense of belonging nowhere&quot;. She attended art school and moved to London, where her first serious novel, &quot;The Wind Changes,&quot; was published in 1937. In August 1939 she married R. D. Smith (&quot;Reggie&quot;), a British Council lecturer posted in Bucharest, Romania, and subsequently lived in Greece, Egypt, and British Mandatory Palestine as the Nazis overran Eastern Europe. Her experiences formed the basis for her best-known work, the six novels making up &quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot; and &quot;The Levant Trilogy&quot;, known collectively as &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;. Critics judged her overall output to be of uneven quality, but this series, published between 1960 and 1980, was described by Anthony Burgess as &quot;the finest fictional record of the war produced by a British writer&quot;.

Manning returned to London after the war and lived there until her death in 1980; she wrote poetry, short stories, novels, non-fiction, reviews, and drama for the British Broadcasting Corporation. Both Manning and her husband had affairs, but they never contemplated divorce. Her relationships with writers such as Stevie Smith and Iris Murdoch were difficult, as an insecure Manning was envious of their greater success. Her constant grumbling about all manner of subjects is reflected in her nickname, &quot;Olivia Moaning&quot;, but Smith never wavered in his role as his wife&#x27;s principal supporter and encourager, confident that her talent would ultimately be recognised. As she had feared, real fame only came after her death in 1980, when an adaptation of &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; was televised in 1987.

Manning&#x27;s books have received limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender and are not easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning&#x27;s importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war and racism, and colonialism and imperialism; they examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.

==Early years==
Olivia Manning was born in North End, Portsmouth on 2 March 1908. Her father, Oliver Manning, was a naval officer who rose from naval trainee to lieutenant commander despite a lack of formal schooling. At the age of 45, while visiting the port of Belfast, he met Olivia Morrow, a publican&#x27;s daughter fourteen years his junior; they married less than a month later in December 1904, in the Presbyterian church in her home town of Bangor, County Down.

Manning adored her womanising father, who entertained others by singing Gilbert and Sullivan and reciting poetry he had memorised during long sea voyages. In contrast, her mother was bossy and domineering, with a &quot;mind as rigid as cast-iron&quot;, and there were constant marital disputes. The initially warm relationship between mother and daughter became strained after the birth of Manning&#x27;s brother Oliver in 1913; delicate and frequently ill, he was the centre of his mother&#x27;s attention, much to the displeasure of Manning, who made several childish attempts to harm him. This unhappy, insecure childhood left a lasting mark on her work and personality.
Manning was educated privately at a small dame school before moving to the north of Ireland in 1916, the first of several extended periods spent there while her father was at sea. In Bangor she attended Bangor Presbyterian School, and in Portsmouth Lyndon House School developing, as she recalled, &quot;the usual Anglo-Irish sense of belonging nowhere&quot;. Schoolmates described her as shy and prone to tantrums; her tendency to tell boastful tall-tales about her family led to ostracism by her peers. Supported by her father, Manning read and wrote extensively, preferring novels, especially those by H. Rider Haggard. Her mother discouraged such pursuits, and confiscated material she thought unsuitable; when she found her daughter reading the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; she scolded that &quot;young men do not like women who read papers like that&quot;, and that Manning should focus on marketable job skills, such as typing.

Indeed, when financial circumstances forced Manning to leave school at sixteen, she worked as a typist and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist&#x27;s eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes.

==Early career==
Manning&#x27;s first published works were three serialised detective novels, &quot;Rose of Rubies&quot;, &quot;Here is Murder&quot; and &quot;The Black Scarab&quot; which appeared in the &quot;Portsmouth News&quot; beginning in 1929 under the pseudonym Jacob Morrow. Manning did not acknowledge these books until the 1960s; their publication dates might have given away her age, a secret she kept even from her husband. Between 1929 and 1935 she wrote about 20 short stories, including a ghost story that was the first work to be published under her own name, though using initials to obscure her gender. Manning also wrote two literary novels, neither of which was accepted for publication. Her second manuscript sufficiently impressed Edward Garnett, a literary editor at Jonathan Cape, that he asked his assistant Hamish Miles to write her a note of encouragement. Miles, a well-connected literary adviser and translator in his late thirties, invited Manning to visit if she were ever in London. Manning, feeling stifled in Portsmouth, had already made efforts to move to the capital, but her meeting with Miles made her more determined. She succeeded in obtaining a typing job at the department store Peter Jones, and, despite opposition from her mother, moved into a run-down bed-sit in Chelsea.

Short of food and money, Manning spent long hours writing after work. Miles took Manning under his wing, dazzling her with dinners, literary conversation, and gossip, and providing unaccustomed support. A married man with two children, he told Manning that his wife was an invalid and no longer able to tolerate sex; they soon became lovers. Manning later recalled that &quot;sex for both of them was the motivating charm of life&quot;.

A case of mistaken identity involving an artist with a similar name led Manning to a better-paid job antiquing furniture, at which she worked for more than two years, still writing in her spare time. She recalled this as &quot;one of the happiest seasons&quot; of her life. With Miles&#x27; encouragement she completed a novel, &quot;The Wind Changes&quot;, and saw it published by Jonathan Cape in April 1937. The novel, set in Dublin in June 1921 during the Irish War of Independence, revolved around a woman torn between an Irish patriot and an English writer with pro-Republican sympathies. It was well received, with one reviewer commenting that &quot;the novel shows unusual promise&quot;. Soon after, Miles learnt that he had an inoperable brain tumour, and disappeared from Manning&#x27;s life. Since the affair had been kept secret she had difficulty obtaining information about him, and could not afford to visit him in the Edinburgh hospital where he lay dying. She lost her job at Peter Jones, moved to a well-paid job at the Medici Society, but was sacked when she refused her boss&#x27;s order to give up novel-writing in the evening so as to conserve her energy for the day job. Manning obtained other work assessing new novels for their potential as films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but by the time she had saved sufficient money for a trip to Edinburgh, Miles was too ill to see her. He died in December 1937.

Miles did not normally introduce his literary friends to each other, but before his death, he had been forced by circumstance to introduce Manning to the poet Stevie Smith. The two developed an immediate rapport and enjoyed exploring London&#x27;s backstreets, with regular outings to museums, cinema, and visits to the Palmers Green home that Smith shared with an eccentric aunt. According to a mutual friend, Manning found in Smith&#x27;s home &quot;an atmosphere of security and comfort which must have made her room in Oakley Street seem even chillier and more threadbare&quot;. The novelist and critic Walter Allen met Manning in 1937 and observed that she had a &quot;devastating&quot; wit &quot;and was as formidable a young woman as any in London&quot;. Manning and Smith, he added, were a malicious pair of snobs.

==Marriage and Romania==
In July 1939, Walter Allen introduced Manning to the charming Marxist R. D. &quot;Reggie&quot; Smith. Smith was a large, energetic man, possessed of a constant desire for the company of others. The son of a Manchester toolmaker, he had studied at Birmingham University, where he had been coached by the left-wing poet Louis MacNeice and founded the Birmingham Socialist Society. According to the British intelligence organisation MI5, Smith had been recruited as a communist spy by Anthony Blunt on a visit to Cambridge University in 1938.

When he met Manning, Smith was on leave from his British Council position as a lecturer in Romania. He had diligently prepared himself for the introduction to Manning by reading her works, and felt that her book &quot;The Wind Changes&quot; showed &quot;signs of genius&quot;. He described Manning as a &quot;jolie laide&quot;, possessing lovely hair, hands, eyes, and skin though an overlong nose, and fell in love at first sight. When he borrowed a half-crown from her on their first meeting and repaid it the next day, he knew they would marry. Manning was less certain of the relationship, but Smith quickly moved into her flat, proposing in bed a few weeks later. They were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 18 August 1939, with Stevie Smith and Louis MacNeice as witnesses. The bridegroom, unconventionally yet true to form, did not produce a ring for the ceremony. A few days after the wedding, the couple received word that Smith had been recalled to Bucharest. They left within a matter of hours; Manning later wrote to Stevie Smith from Romania asking her to find out what had happened to their flat and to take care of her books while she was away.
The couple travelled by train to Bucharest, arriving on 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany. Between the two world wars, Romania had looked to France to guarantee its security against German territorial aspirations. The impact of the Munich Agreement (1938), the GermanâSoviet Non-Aggression Pact (1939), and the Fall of France (1940) increased German influence and control over the country, and included demands that Romania cede territory and resources. The couple&#x27;s time in Bucharest coincided with the rise of fascist and totalitarian power within ostensibly neutral Romania, while war threatened from without, driving thousands of refugees within its borders.

The Smiths initially rented a flat, but later moved in with the diplomat Adam Watson, who was working with the British Legation. Those who knew Manning at the time described her as a shy, provincial girl who had little experience with other cultures. She was both dazzled and appalled by Romania. The cafÃ© society, with its wit and gossip, appealed to her, but she was repelled by the peasantry and the aggressive, often mutilated, beggars. Her Romanian experiences were captured in the first two volumes of &quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot; (&quot;The Great Fortune&quot; and &quot;The Spoilt City&quot;), considered one of the most important literary treatments of Romania during the war. In her novels, Manning described Bucharest as being on the margins of European civilisation, &quot;a strange, half-Oriental capital&quot; that was &quot;primitive, bug-ridden and brutal&quot;, whose citizens were peasants, whatever their wealth or status.

Manning spent her days writing; her main project was a book about Henry Morton Stanley and his search for Emin Pasha, but she also maintained an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj, Transylvania, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary as part of the Second Vienna Award of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, the interview was to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Smith with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Smith&#x27;s production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another.

Smith was relentlessly gregarious, and throughout his life, his warmth, wit, and friendliness earned him many friends and drinking companions. In contrast, Manning was reticent and uncomfortable in social settings and remained in the background. She acted, in her own words, as a &quot;camp-follower&quot;, trailing after Smith as he went from bar to bar, often choosing to go home early and alone. While Manning remained faithful to Smith during the war, their friend Ivor Porter was to report that Smith had numerous affairs.

The approaching war and rise of fascism and the Iron Guard in Romania disconcerted and frightened Manning. The abdication of King Carol and the advance of the Germans in September 1940 increased her fears, and she repeatedly asked Smith &quot;But where will the Jews go?&quot; Just before German troops entered Romania on 7 October at the invitation of the new dictator Ion Antonescu, Manning flew to Greece, followed a week later by Smith.

==Greece and Egypt==
Manning was subject to anxieties bordering on paranoia throughout her life. She had good reason to be concerned about Smith, who travelled from Romania to Greece on the German Lufthansa airline â Lufthansa planes were sometimes diverted to Axis countries. He arrived safely, bringing a rucksack, a suitcase full of books, but no appropriate clothes for work. Smith relaunched his hectic social life, but his wife interacted little with the expatriate community, focussing instead on her writing. Nevertheless, this was a happy time for Manning; &quot;Romania is abroad,&quot; said Manning, &quot;but Greece is home&quot;. Manning had her admirers, including Terence Spencer, a British Council lecturer who acted as her companion while Smith was busy with other activities â he later appeared as the character Charles Warden in &quot;Friends and Heroes&quot;, the third book of &quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot;. Soon after their arrival, Greece entered the war against the Axis. In spite of early successes against invading Italian forces, by April 1941 the country was at risk of invasion from the Germans; in a later poem Manning recalled the &quot;horror and terror of defeat&quot; of a people she had grown to love. The British Council advised its staff to evacuate, and on 18 April Manning and Smith left Piraeus for Egypt on the &quot;Erebus&quot;, the last civilian ship to leave Greece.

For the three dangerous days of the passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with the Smiths were the novelist Robert Liddell, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wivesâ the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms by the end of the voyage, but Manning had the last word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot.

Arriving in Alexandria, the refugees gratefully devoured the food provided by the British military, but learned that the swastika was now flying over the Acropolis. Manning&#x27;s first impressions of Egypt were of squalor and unreality: &quot;For weeks we lived in a state of recoil&quot;. From Alexandria they went by train to Cairo, where they renewed contact with Adam Watson, who was now Second Secretary at the British Embassy. He invited them to stay at his Garden City flat that overlooked the embassy.

Though nominally an independent country, Egypt had been effectively under British control since the late nineteenth century. With the outbreak of war, and under the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936, the country was under virtual occupation by the British. At this stage in the war, the Germans were advancing apparently unstoppably across the desert towards Egypt, and Cairo was rife with rumours and alarms. Manning was jittery and fearful. She was constantly anxious about illness and was indeed frequently unwell. Concerned, Smith suggested that it might be best if she returned to England, but she retorted &quot;Wherever we go, we go together. If we return home, we both go. I won&#x27;t have the war separating us. End of story.&quot; Her father had made her a firm believer in the British Empire and the benefits it had brought the world, and Manning was a patriotic Briton, confident of ultimate Allied success. In Egypt, she confronted the fact that British occupation had never been popular. Smith quickly discovered the Anglo-Egyptian Union in Zamalek, where he drank and talked politics and poetry. As usual, he was well liked, and according to Lawrence Durrell often had a string of disreputable friends with him. Manning was much less popular. Durrell described her as a &quot;hook-nosed condor&quot;, whose critical manner was unappreciated by many who knew her.

Manning was incensed that the British Council did not immediately find a job for Smith, whom she considered one of their most brilliant teachers. She took her revenge by writing scurrilous verse about the council&#x27;s representative, C. F. A. Dundas, later immortalised as the ineffectual Colin Gracey in &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;. Manning&#x27;s characters were often based on real people though she never drew precisely from life. Her mocking portrait of the British Council lecturer Professor Lord Pinkrose was loosely based on Lord Dunsany, sent to occupy the Byron Chair of English at Athens University in 1940. She also resented that Amy Smart, wife of Walter Smart and frequent patron of artists, poets, and writers in Cairo, paid so little attention to her and Smith; she later took revenge in a similar way.
In October 1941, Smith was offered a post as lecturer at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Smith and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver&#x27;s death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.

The air raids became intolerable to Manning, and she soon moved back to Cairo, where in late 1941 she became press attachÃ© at the United States Legation. In her spare time, she worked on &quot;Guests at the Marriage&quot;, an unpublished prototype for &quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot;, as well as short stories and poetry, some of which she sent to Stevie Smith in the hopes of getting them published. Over the years, Stevie had brooded over Manning&#x27;s desertion of their friendship to marry Reggie Smith, and around this time Stevie&#x27;s jealousy took an overt form; in 1942 she wrote a poem entitled &quot;Murder&quot;, in which a man stands beside a grave and admits, &quot;My hand brought Reggie Smith to this strait bed â / Well, fare his soul well, fear not I the dead&quot;. In subsequent reprintings, the name &quot;Reggie Smith&quot; was replaced by &quot;Filmer Smith&quot;, veiling the allusion, but Manning found out and was furious.

During her time in Egypt, Manning became a contributor to two Middle East-based literary magazines, &quot;Desert Poets&quot; and &quot;Personal Landscapes&quot;, founded by Bernard Spencer, Lawrence Durrell and Robin Fedden. The last sought to explore the &quot;personal landscapes&quot; of writers experiencing exile during the war. The founders, like Manning, maintained a strong attachment to Greece rather than an artistic and intellectual engagement with Egypt. In remembering the departure from Greece Manning wrote &quot;We faced the sea / Knowing until the day of our return we would be / Exiles from a country not our own.&quot; During their time in Egypt and Palestine Manning and her husband maintained close links with refugee Greek writers, including translating and editing the work of George Seferis and Elie Papadimitriou. Manning described her impressions of the Cairo poetry scene in &quot;Poets in Exile&quot; in Cyril Connolly&#x27;s magazine &quot;Horizon&quot;. She defended the writers from the claim of a London reviewer that they were &quot;out of touch&quot;, suggesting that their work was strengthened by their access to other cultures, languages and writers. Her review was much critiqued by those featured, including Durrell, who objected to Spencer&#x27;s poetry being praised at his expense.

In 1942 Smith was appointed as Controller of English and Arabic Programming at the Palestine Broadcasting Service in Jerusalem; the job was to begin later but in early July, with the German troops rapidly advancing on Egypt, he persuaded Manning to go ahead to Jerusalem to &quot;prepare the way&quot;.

==Palestine==
The couple were to spend three years in Jerusalem. On arrival, Manning approached the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; for a job, and was soon appointed a reviewer. Between 1943 and 1944 she served as press assistant at Jerusalem&#x27;s Public Information office, and then moved to the same position at the British Council office in Jerusalem. Manning continued to work on her book about Stanley and Emin Pasha, and took advantage of army drivers who were willing to give lifts to civilians; she visited Palestine, Petra and Damascus, gathering material for future works.

In 1944, Manning became pregnant; the couple were overjoyed and Manning relaxed, becoming less critical of others, including her own mother, with whom she had long had a difficult relationship. Uncharacteristically, she rested, walked, painted and even knitted. In the seventh month the baby died &quot;in utero&quot;, and as was the practice at the time Manning was obliged to wait two difficult months to deliver her dead child. &quot;I am like a walking cemetery&quot;, she sorrowfully repeated during this period. Grief-stricken, Manning became paranoid, constantly afraid that Smith would be assassinated. Smith decided that she was having a nervous breakdown and in October 1944 accompanied her to Cyprus for a month&#x27;s holiday. Returning to Jerusalem, she was still far from well, and the poet Louis Lawler noticed the discontent of this &quot;strange and difficult woman&quot; and Smith&#x27;s &quot;wonderfully patient&quot; behaviour, despite Manning calling her husband by his last name throughout the period. Manning never fully recovered from her loss and was rarely to talk or write of it. She was unable to have further children and in the future directed her maternal feelings towards animals, especially cats.

During her time in the Middle East Manning had picked up amoebic dysentery, which led to several admissions to hospitals in Cairo and Palestine. When the war in Europe ended in May 1945, her state of health led the couple to decide that Manning should return to Britain earlier than Smith. They travelled to Suez together, whence she sailed for home alone.

==Post-war England==
After a brief stay with her still-grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth, Manning moved into a London flat. Smith arrived in mid-1945 and found a job in the Features Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He was identified as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947 and placed under surveillance. According to his file, Smith had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband&#x27;s political beliefs, but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Smith was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956.

Manning also worked for the BBC; she wrote scripts for radio including adaptations of novels by George Eliot, Arnold Bennett and Ada Leverson. She completed her book on Stanley and Emin Pasha, titled &quot;The Remarkable Expedition&quot; in the UK and &quot;The Reluctant Rescue&quot; in the US, which was published in 1947, and subsequently reissued in 1985. The book received generally good reviews but remains comparatively unknown. In 1948, her book of short stories, &quot;Growing Up&quot;, was published by Heinemann, with the title story a fictionalised account of her affair with Hamish Miles. Manning was to remain with the publisher until 1974.

After living in a series of rented flats, in 1951 the couple moved to a house in St. John&#x27;s Wood, where they sublet rooms to lodgers such as the actors Julian Mitchell and Tony Richardson. Fuelled by plenty of gin and tonic to cover her shyness, Manning could be a witty participant in London&#x27;s literary scene; as in childhood she was given to making boastful inventions, such as claiming a family relationship to Marie Belloc Lowndes and that she had received a marriage proposal from Anthony Burgess the morning after his wife&#x27;s death. Her insecurities also showed in other ways: she was very anxious about finances, and always alert for ways to make and save money. After the war both she and Smith were unfaithful. At parties, Smith would regularly ask other women if they were interested in extramarital encounters, while Manning claimed to have had affairs with both William Gerhardie and Henry Green, and engaged in an unrequited pursuit of her lodger, Tony Richardson. Jerry Slattery, her doctor, became her long-term lover; her affair came as a shock to Smith, who felt he must have disappointed his wife. After a difficult start, Smith adjusted and soon became a close friend of Slattery. Manning&#x27;s adultery in some ways made it easier for Smith to justify his own frequent affairs, including his longstanding relationship with Diana Robson, who was to become his second wife. Manning never paid undue attention to his infidelities, usually responding, &quot;you know what Reggie&#x27;s like&quot;. The two never contemplated divorce, believing that marriage was a lifelong commitment.

Manning&#x27;s first post-war novel, &quot;Artist Among the Missing&quot;, an evocative account of life in the Middle East, was published in 1949 and received mixed reviews. She worked on an Irish travel book, &quot;The Dreaming Shore&quot;, which drew on her Anglo-Irish upbringing, but proved &quot;a millstone&quot; as it required multiple expensive journeys to Ireland. The book was notable for her view that Ireland would one day be united. Manning continued the series of publications with &quot;School for Love&quot;, published in 1951. The novel concerned a boy growing up in Palestine during the Second World War. With its publication, Smith, on whom Manning relied heavily for literary judgment, help, and support, boasted that &quot;My Olivia is what might be called an established author&quot;. The novel was generally well-received, but faced the possibility of a libel suit from Clarissa Graves, sister of Robert on whom Miss Bohun, one of the novel&#x27;s characters, may have been based.

Manning supplemented her book writing by reviewing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot; and others, as well as making occasional contributions to the &quot;Palestine Post&quot;. Her fourth novel, &quot;A Different Face&quot;, was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning&#x27;s hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character&#x27;s attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling that she did not get the reviews she deserved. Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was Iris Murdoch, with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch&#x27;s greater success. Manning knew that she was spiteful, but could not help herself, frequently critiquing writer friends to others. She consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton-Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: Anthony Powell called her &quot;the world&#x27;s worst grumbler&quot;, and the publisher remembered that she was &quot;never an easy author to handle&quot;. A friend gave her the nickname &quot;Olivia Moaning&quot;, which was picked up by others, much to Manning&#x27;s annoyance.

In 1955 Manning published &quot;The Doves of Venus&quot;, which drew on her experiences in London in the 1930s; the two friends, Ellie Parsons and Nancy Claypole, bore similarities to Manning and Stevie Smith. In the book, an isolated Ellie seeks to escape a stultifying mother. The reviews were generally favourable, but Manning was not satisfied. Perhaps annoyed at her depiction in the novel, Stevie Smith wrote what Manning described as a &quot;bitchy review&quot;; the two great friends barely spoke thereafter, despite Smith&#x27;s efforts at a rapprochement. Eventually, Manning grudgingly forgave her: learning of Smith&#x27;s final illness, she remarked, &quot;Well, if she&#x27;s really ill, we&#x27;ll have to let bygones be bygones.&quot;

Much time and focus were given to animals, especially the Siamese cats of which Manning was especially fond. She was very concerned about the health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets â telling one &quot;I do not pay you to tell me that there is nothing wrong with my animal&quot;Â â and trying animal faith healers at times. She was also a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book &quot;Extraordinary Cats&quot;, published in 1967.

In December 1956, Manning published &quot;My Husband Cartwright&quot;, a series of twelve sketches about Smith that had originally appeared in &quot;Punch&quot;. It was not widely reviewed, and as usual, Manning was frustrated and annoyed. The book was to be a precursor of her portrait of her husband in &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, detailing comic episodes that highlighted Smith&#x27;s character, including his gregarious nature and interest in social issues: &quot;My husband Cartwright is a lover of his fellow-men. Lovers of their fellow-men can be maddeningÂ ... While lecturing abroad he suddenly conceived a resentment of &#x27;sights&#x27; especially &#x27;useless&#x27; sights, such as ruins or tombs. You might suppose that were it not for such distractions as Tiberias, the Valley of the Kings or Hadrian&#x27;s Villa, tourists abroad would occupy themselves solely in alleviating poverty.&quot;

==&quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot; and other works==
Between 1956 and 1964 Manning&#x27;s main project was &quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot;, a sequence of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Smith. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they live and work in Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person, though there was significant fictionalisation. While Manning had been 31 and Smith 25 at the outset of war, Manning&#x27;s alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.

The first book in the trilogy, &quot;The Great Fortune&quot;, received mixed reviews, but subsequent volumes, &quot;The Spoilt City&quot; and &quot;Friends and Heroes&quot; were generally well-received; Anthony Burgess announced that Manning was &quot;among the most accomplished of our women novelists&quot; and comparisons were made to Lawrence Durrell, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell. There were a few unfavorable criticisms, and as usual, they ignited Manning&#x27;s ire.

Following the publication of the final volume of &quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot; in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, &quot;A Romantic Hero and Other Stories&quot;, both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, &quot;The Play Room&quot; (published as &quot;The Camperlea Girls&quot; in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and &quot;The Play Room&quot; both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing. &quot;Everything fizzled out&quot;, she said. &quot;I wasted a lot of time and that is something which you cannot afford to do when you are sixty&quot;; in keeping with her obfuscations about her age, she was actually sixty-two.

==&quot;The Levant Trilogy&quot;==
The 1970s brought a number of changes to the household: the couple moved to a smaller apartment following Smith&#x27;s early retirement from the BBC and 1972 appointment as a lecturer at the New University of Ulster in Coleraine. The couple subsequently lived apart for long periods, as Manning rejected the idea of moving to Ireland. In 1974 Manning adapted two of Arnold Bennett&#x27;s works (&quot;The Card&quot; and &quot;The Regent&quot;) into an eight part BBC Radio play: &quot;Denry - The Adventures Of A Card&quot;. Graham Armitage portrayed the eponymous Denry with Ursula O&#x27;Leary as the beautiful Countess of Chell.

Manning was always a close observer of life, and gifted with a photographic memory. She told her friend Kay Dick that, &quot;I write out of experience, I have no fantasy. I don&#x27;t think anything I&#x27;ve experienced has ever been wasted. Her 1974 novel &quot;The Rain Forest&quot; showed off her creative skills in her portrayal of a fictional island in the Indian Ocean and its inhabitants. Set in 1953, the novel&#x27;s central characters are a British couple; the book examines their personal experiences and tragedies against the background of a violent end to colonial British rule. The book is one of Manning&#x27;s lesser-known books, and she was disappointed that it was not shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

Early in 1975 Manning began &quot;The Danger Tree&quot;, which for a time she described as &quot;The Fourth Part of the Balkan Trilogy&quot;; in the event, it became the first novel in &quot;The Levant Trilogy&quot;, continuing the story of the Pringles in the Middle East. The first book proved &quot;a long struggle&quot; to write, in part because of Manning&#x27;s lack of confidence in her powers of invention: the book juxtaposes the Desert War experiences of a young officer, Simon Boulderstone, with the securer lives of the Pringles and their circle. Manning, fascinated by sibling relationships, and remembering the death of her own brother, also examined the relationship between Simon and his elder brother, Hugo. She felt inadequate in her ability to write about soldiers and military scenes; initial reviewers agreed, finding her writing unconvincing and improbable, though subsequent reviewers have been considerably kinder.

While some parts of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of &quot;The Danger Tree&quot; describes the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart&#x27;s eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb during a desert picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief-stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through a hole in his cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts&#x27; failure to include her and Smith in their artistic circle in Cairo. The scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning&#x27;s friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning&#x27;s very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning&#x27;s publisher received a solicitor&#x27;s letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring that there should be no further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer, and poet Stephen Haggard, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard&#x27;s case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, and remained with them until the end of her life. &quot;The Danger Tree&quot; was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1976 Birthday Honours.

With Field Marshal Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; as her guide, Manning found battle scenes easier to write in the second volume of the trilogy, &quot;The Battle Lost and Won&quot;. After a slow start, Manning wrote with certainty and speed; the book was completed in a record seven months and published in 1978. The book follows the Pringles as Rommel and the Afrika Korps approach Alexandria, where Guy is teaching. Egypt remains a place of privilege and sexual exchange for the non-combatants and the Pringles&#x27; marriage slowly disintegrates.

==Final years==
Manning was deeply affected by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant for more than a quarter of a century. Manning&#x27;s last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly affected her, leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in &quot;The Levant Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Sum of Things&quot;, in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but having said goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet&#x27;s travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy&#x27;s supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet&#x27;s ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone&#x27;s injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery.

&quot;The Sum of Things&quot; was published posthumously, for on 4 July 1980 Manning suffered a severe stroke while visiting friends in the Isle of Wight. She died in hospital in Ryde on 23 July; somewhat typically, Smith, having been recalled from Ireland, was not present when she died. He could not bear to see her &quot;fade away&quot; and had gone to London to keep himself busy. Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Smith would be late for her funeral, and he almost was. His mourning period, characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth, was precisely how Manning had imagined Guy Pringle&#x27;s reaction to Harriet&#x27;s supposed death in &quot;The Sum of Things&quot;. Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at Billingham Manor on the Isle of Wight.

Manning had long complained about the lack of recognition she had received as a writer and was not consoled when her husband and friends responded that her talent would be recognised, and her works read for years to come. &quot;I want to be really famous now, &quot;Now&quot;&quot;, she retorted. As it happened, her renown and readership developed substantially after her death; a television serialisation of &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; starring Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh finally came to fruition in 1987, bringing her work to a wider audience.

==Work==

===Reception===
The posthumous popularity of &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; notwithstanding, most of Manning&#x27;s books are rarely read and have received little critical attention. Of her books, only &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, &quot;School for Love&quot;, &quot;The Doves of Venus&quot;, &quot;The Rain Forest&quot; and &quot;A Romantic Hero&quot; remain in print. Some of her novels, most often &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, have been translated into French, German, Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, Greek, Romanian and Hebrew. As in her lifetime, opinions are divided; some assert that her books are &quot;flawed by self-indulgence and a lack of self-judgment&quot;, and criticise portrayals of ethnic and religious groups as stereotyped and caricatured. Others praise tight, perceptive and convincing narratives and excellent characterisation. Her plots are often described as journeys, odysseys and quests in both literal and metaphorical senses. Manning&#x27;s talent for &quot;exquisite evocations of place&quot;, including physical, cultural and historical aspects have been widely admired, and the critic Walter Allen complimented her &quot;painter&#x27;s eye for the visible world&quot;.

====&quot;Fortunes of War&quot;====
Manning&#x27;s best known works, the six books comprising &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, have been described as &quot;the most underrated novels of the twentieth century&quot; and the author as &quot;among the greatest practitioners of 20th-century &quot;roman-fleuve&quot;&quot;. Written during the Cold War more than sixteen years after the period described, &quot;The Balkan Trilogy&quot;, set in Romania and Greece, is considered one of the most important literary treatments of the region in wartime, while criticised for the Cold War era images of Balkanism, and for Manning&#x27;s inability to &quot;conceal her antipathy towards all things Romanian&quot;. &quot;The Levant Trilogy&quot;, set in the Middle East, is praised for its detailed description of Simon Boulderstone&#x27;s desert war experience and the juxtaposition of the Pringles and their marriage with important world events. Excerpts from the novels have been reprinted in collections of women&#x27;s war writing.
Theodore Steinberg argues for the &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; to be seen as an epic novel, noting its broad scope and the large cast of interesting characters set at a pivotal point of history. As with other epic novels, the books examine intertwined personal and national themes. There are frequent references to the Fall of Troy, including Guy Pringle&#x27;s production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; in which British expatriates play themselves while Romania and Europe mirror the doomed Troy. In Steinberg&#x27;s perspective, the books also challenge the typically male genre conventions of the epic novel by viewing the war principally through the eyes of a female character &quot;who frequently contrasts her perceptions with those of the men who surround her&quot;. In contrast, Adam Piette views the novel sequence as a failed epic, the product of a Cold War desire to repress change as illustrated by &quot;Harriet&#x27;s self-pityingly dogged focus on their marriage&quot; without dealing with the radicalism of the war, and fate of its victims as represented by Guy and his political engagement.

====Other works====
Manning&#x27;s other works have largely been described as precursors to the two trilogies. Her pre-war novel, &quot;The Wind Changes&quot; (1937), set in Ireland, anticipates the future works in its &quot;subtle exploration of relationships against a backdrop of war&quot;. Her post-war works, which are alternately set at home and abroad, are considered first, less than successful steps in clarifying her ideas about an expatriate war and how to write about it. Novels and stories set in England and Ireland are permeated by staleness and discontent, while those set abroad highlight the excitement and adventure of her later works. Two books set in Jerusalem, &quot;The Artist Among the Missing&quot; (1949) and &quot;School for Love&quot; (1951), her first commercial and critical success, are also first steps in exploring themes such war, colonialism and British imperialism.

Manning wrote reviews, radio adaptations and scripts and several non-fiction books. Her book &quot;The Remarkable Expedition&quot; (1947) about Emin Pasha and Henry Stanley was generally well reviewed, and when reissued in 1985 was praised for its humour, story telling and fairness to both subjects. Her travel book about Ireland, &quot;The Dreaming Shore&quot; (1950), received a mixed review even from her old friend Louis MacNeice, but extracts from this and other of Manning&#x27;s Irish writing have subsequently been admired and anthologised. Manning&#x27;s book &quot;Extraordinary cats&quot; (1967) proved to be chiefly about her own well-loved pets, and Stevie Smith&#x27;s review in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; complained that the book was &quot;more agitated than original&quot;. She also published two collections of short stories, the well-reviewed &quot;Growing Up&quot; (1946) and &quot;A Romantic Hero and Other Stories&quot; (1967); the latter included eight stories from the earlier volume, and is imbued with a sense of mortality.

===Themes===

====War====
In contrast to other women&#x27;s war fiction of the period, Manning&#x27;s works do not recount life on the home front. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non-combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning&#x27;s view, are battles for place and influence, and &quot;with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant&quot;. Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, the conflict is viewed largely from the perspective of a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone&#x27;s soldier&#x27;s view of battle. Views differ on her success in the &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; battlescenes; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of &quot;Artist among the Missing&quot; that &quot;it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper&quot;. There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and repetitionÂ â of stories, events and deathsÂ â used to give &quot;the impression of lives trapped in an endless war&quot; for which there is no end in sight.

====Colonialism and imperialism====
A major theme of Manning&#x27;s works is the British empire in decline. Her fiction contrasts deterministic, imperialistic views of history with one that accepts the possibility of change for those displaced by colonialism. Manning&#x27;s works take a strong stance against British imperialism, and are harshly critical of racism, anti-Semitism and oppression at the end of the British colonial era. &quot;British imperialism is shown to be a corrupt and self-serving system, which not only deserves to be dismantled but which is actually on the verge of being dismantled&quot;, writes Steinberg. The British characters in Manning&#x27;s novels almost all assume the legitimacy of British superiority and imperialism and struggle with their position as oppressors who are unwelcome in countries they have been brought up to believe welcome their colonising influence. In this view, Harriet&#x27;s character, marginalised as an exile and a woman, is both oppressor and oppressed, while characters such as Guy, Prince Yakimov and Sophie seek to exert various forms of power and authority over others, reflecting in microcosm the national conflicts and imperialism of the British Empire. Phyllis Lassner, who has written extensively on Manning&#x27;s writing from a colonial and post-colonial perspective, notes how even sympathetic characters are not excused their complicity as colonisers; the responses of the Pringles assert &quot;the vexed relationship between their own status as colonial exiles and that of the colonised&quot; and native Egyptians, though given very little direct voice in &quot;The Levant Trilogy&quot;, nevertheless assert subjectivity for their country.

In &quot;The Artist Among the Missing&quot; (1949), Manning illustrates the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and multiculturalism mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind in which the British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The &quot;School for Love&quot; (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy&#x27;s journey of disillusionment in a city that is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun.

Manning explores these themes not only in her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, &quot;The Wind Changes&quot; (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, colonialist attitudes are reproduced by Manning&#x27;s stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus on the impact of the end of colonial rule. &quot;The Rain Forest&quot; (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island&#x27;s future post-independence prospects.

====Displacement and &quot;Otherness&quot;====
Displacement and alienation are regular themes in Manning&#x27;s books. Characters are often isolated, physically and emotionally removed from family and familiar contexts and seeking a place to belong. This crisis of identity may reflect that of Manning herself as the daughter of an Irish mother and a British naval officer. &quot;I&#x27;m really confused about what I am, never really feeling that I belong in either place&quot;, she told an interviewer in 1969. In Manning&#x27;s war fiction, conflict creates additional anxiety, emotional displacement and distance, with characters unable to communicate with each other. Eve Patten notes the &quot;pervasive sense of liminality&quot; and the recurrent figure of the refugee in Manning&#x27;s work. Early literary interest in displacement was reinforced by Manning&#x27;s own terrifying and disorientating experiences as a refugee during the war. Her travels also brought her into direct contact with the far worse plight of other war refugees, including Jewish asylum-seekers who were leaving Romania aboard the &quot;Struma&quot;. Exile had its rewards for literary refugees such as Manning, offering exposure to different cultures and &quot;the sense of a greater, past civilisation&quot;, as she described in her 1944 review of British poetry. Her writing reflects her deep concern for the realities of most refugees, who are portrayed as &quot;a degraded and demoralised Other&quot;, challenging complacent Western notions of stability and nationality.

Manning has been classified as an Orientalist writer, whose depictions of cultures frequently emphasise exoticism and alien landscape. This feature has been most closely examined in her novels set in Romania. In these, scholars note Manning&#x27;s positioning of Romania as an exotic &quot;Other&quot;, a legacy of the Ottoman Empire located at the limits of civilised Europe and on the frontier with the uncivilised Orient. Her negative perceptions of Romanian &quot;Otherness&quot; include a childlike population living decadent lives, passive and immoral women, corruption, and a wild, untamed environment. These are contrasted with more positive reactions to Greece and Western Europe as the centre of civilising and orderly life in other books. In keeping with colonial construction of exoticism in Western literature, &quot;otherness&quot; is increasingly domesticated as characters recognise, with greater exposure to the country, links to Western culture. Her depiction of Romania led to &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; being restricted as seditious writing under Romania&#x27;s Communist government.

====Gender and feminism====
Manning&#x27;s books are not easily classified as a part of the feminist canon. Manning supported the rights of women, particularly equal literary fees, but had no sympathy for the women&#x27;s movement, writing that &quot;[t]hey make such an exhibition of themselves. None can be said to be beauties. Most have faces like porridge.&quot; In Manning&#x27;s books, the word &quot;feminine&quot; is used in a derogatory sense, and tends to be associated with female complacency, foolishness, artifice and deviousness, and fulfilment for women comes in fairly conventional roles of wife, mother and the private domain. Elizabeth Bowen remarked that Manning had &quot;an almost masculine outfit in the way of experience&quot; that influenced her writing about women and the war. Manning viewed herself not as a female writer, but as a writer who happened to be a woman, and early in her career she obscured her gender using a pseudonym and initials. Manning found it easier to create male characters, and in general her novels tend to minimise differences in gender, writing about people rather than women in particular. Harriet Pringle, for example, moves through processes of self-discovery and empowerment as an individual rather than in feminist solidarity with her sex. In Manning&#x27;s &quot;The Doves of Venus&quot; (1960), based on Manning&#x27;s friendship with Stevie Smith, female characters display &quot;the 1950s anger more often associatedÂ ... with young men&quot;. Treglown comments on how Manning&#x27;s early books generally took a forthright approach to sex, often initiated by female characters. Her approach became more nuanced in later volumes, with a subtler depiction of sex, sensuality and sexual frustration in &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;. The Jungian critic Richard Sugg interpreted Manning&#x27;s female characters as punishing themselves for breaching society&#x27;s gender norms, including for having erotic feelings. In contrast, Treglown hypothesised that it reflected Manning&#x27;s ongoing grieving for her stillborn child.

<doc id="925978" wikidata="Q7807653" url="?curid=925978" title="Timperley">
<text>Timperley is a suburban village in the borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester, England. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Cheshire, it is approximately six miles southwest of central Manchester. The population at the 2021 census was 11,323.

==History==
The name Timperley derives from &quot;Timber Leah&quot;, the Anglo-Saxon (Old English) for a &quot;clearing in the forest&quot;. This can be used to roughly date the settlement of Timperley to between the 7th and 8th centuries. Timperley was a predominantly agricultural settlement before the Industrial Revolution, focusing mainly on arable crops.
The Bridgewater Canal branch from Stretford to Runcorn was built through Timperley and opened in 1776. This improvement in transport encouraged the development of market gardening in the area to serve the growing city of Manchester. The city also provided a source of night soil which was unloaded from the canal by Deansgate Lane to provide manure for farms and market gardens.

===Railways===
During the mid-19th century four railways were built in Timperley. The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) opened in 1849 with a station in Timperley on Wash Lane (now Park Road). The Warrington and Stockport Railway (W&amp;SR) opened in 1854 from Timperley Junction just south of Timperley station on the MSJAR. It became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1859. The Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway was built through Timperley to link with the now LNWR W&amp;S at Broadheath Junction opening in February 1866 and, from Skelton Junction, to link with the MSJAR at Deansgate Junction opening in December 1865. This became part of the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC).

Baguley station on the CLC line also served Timperley village. Timperley curve was built in 1879 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) linking Skelton Junction with Timperley Junction. The CLC line (often referred to as the West Timperley line) from Skelton Junction to Glazebrook was opened in 1873. West Timperley railway station on this line was actually in Broadheath. The arrival of the railways in Timperley brought the middle classes from the centre of Manchester, and this is reflected by the increase of numbers in domestic services in Timperley at the same time. The impact of the railway can be seen in Timperley&#x27;s growth between 1851 and 1871, more than doubling from 1,008 to 2,112.

In 1931, the MSJAR line was electrified, one of the first railway lines in Great Britain to use supply by overhead cables. A large electrical sub-station was built in connection with this just south of Timperley station. The line was converted to be part of Manchester Metrolink in 1992.

==Governance==
Timperley was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Bowdon, in 1866 Timperley became a separate civil parish, Timperley Parish Council was established in 1894 and it became part of Bucklow Rural District, on 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished and merged with Altrincham, Hale and Sale. In 1931 the parish had a population of 7080. and it became part of Altrincham Urban District.

In 1974, Altrincham UD was merged into the new Trafford Metropolitan Borough of Greater Manchester. The wards of Timperley Central and Timperley North have six out of sixty-three seats on Trafford Council; both wards returned three Liberal Democrats each at the 2023 local elections. Parts of Timperley are also in Broadheath and Hale Barns &amp; Timperley South wards.

Since 1997, Timperley has formed part of the Altrincham and Sale West Constituency,
before that it was encompassed by the Altrincham and Sale constituency. It has been represented, since 2024, in the House of Commons by the Labour MP, Connor Rand.

There are major competitions most weekends from April to October, and there are some major competitions during the winter months. If there are no major competitions over a weekend there is normally
a social competition.

In 1934 the owner died and the members were unable to buy the course for their own use, being outbid by Altrincham Urban Council. The course then became municipal, and the members of Timperley Golf Club decided to find a new home, moved to Baguley and built a new course. After a short stay at Baguley the club moved again and founded Mere Golf Club.

Altrincham Council continued to run the Old Hall as a clubhouse until 1955, when it was sold to Chester&#x27;s Brewery and became the Old Hall Hotel. In May 2003 The Old Hall was bought by Hydes Brewery and has been converted into a Heritage Inn.

The course has remained in its original layout with only minor alterations. During World War 2 the club continued to operate, but lost the second and third holes for the production of potatoes. The present club was founded in 1935, and although the course is municipal, the club is private.

==Religion==

According to the 2011 UK census, the religious make up of Trafford is 63.4% Christian, 5.70% Muslim, 1.0% Hindu, 1.10% Jewish and 0.3% Buddhist. 21.2% were recorded as having no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion and 6.3% did not state their religion. Timperley is in the Church of England Diocese of Chester with Christ Church as the parish church and Holy Cross Church as a second place of worship. Timperley is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury,

==Transport==

The Manchester Metrolink tram network passes about 3/4-mile west of the village centre; Timperley Metrolink station is on Park Road and lies on the route between Manchester city centre and Altrincham.

Navigation Road station is located just outside Timperley in East Altrincham. It is a Northern-operated heavy rail station on the Mid-Cheshire Line with an adjoining light rail station served by the Altrincham line of the Manchester Metrolink tram network.

==Present day==
Today Timperley is a suburban area extending from the A56 road in the west to the main Stockport Road roundabout on the A560 in the east. Much of the housing stock dates from the 1930s and later. Typically houses are slightly larger than the traditional &quot;northern terraces&quot;. Older houses tend to be in the red brick cottage style of north Cheshire.

<doc id="925979" wikidata="Q2878364" url="?curid=925979" title="Back Beat Records">
<text>Back Beat Records was an American record label launched in 1957, as the Houston-based soul sub-label of Duke Records, when it was run by Don Robey. ABC Records assumed ownership of Back Beat on May 23, 1973, as part of ABC&#x27;s acquisition of Back Beat&#x27;s parent label Duke. The label&#x27;s biggest hits included &quot;Treat Her Right&quot; by Roy Head &amp; The Traits, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; by Norman Fox &amp; The Rob-Roys and &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; by Carl Carlton. The last of these was the title cut of an album intended to be issued on Back Beat in December 1974, but ABC ended up issuing the album on their main label, as they had discontinued Back Beat at the last minute.

There are many records from Back Beat that found fame but not fortune, as the records are part of the underground movement known as Northern soul. Carl Carlton probably recorded the most tracks that fall into the Northern soul sound.

==Back Beat label variations==
===Independent distribution===
* 1957-1959: White, lime green and dark blue &quot;kettle drum&quot; label
* 1959-1973: Red, white and yellow label with yellow drumsticks

===ABC distribution===
* 1973-1974: White and red label with yellow drumsticks 
* 1974: Dark green and blue label with &quot;abc Back Beat&quot; (&quot;abc&quot; circle logo) between two lines, all in white. Only one record was released with this format: &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; by Carl Carlton (BB 27001, originally released on the white and red label)

== Back Beat recording artists ==
* Carl Carlton (born 1952)
* Bobby Doyle (1939â2006)
* Norman Fox &amp; The Rob-Roys
* Roy Head (1941-2020)
* Joe Hinton (1929â1968)
* Eddie Wilson
* Doodle Owens (1939â1999)
* O.V. Wright (1939â1980)

<doc id="925981" wikidata="Q7758362" url="?curid=925981" title="The Print Shop">
<text>The Print Shop is a desktop publishing software package originally published in 1984 by Broderbund. It was unique in that it provided libraries of clip art and templates through a simple interface to build signs, posters and banners with household dot-matrix printers. Over the years, the software has been updated to accommodate changing file formats and printer technologies.

The original version was for the Apple II and created signs, cards, banners, and letterheads. Designed by David Balsam and programmed by Martin Kahn, it became one of the most popular Apple II titles of all time. Versions for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit computers followed, as did a variant for the Apple IIGS.

==Reception==
The Print Shop was very successful. In 1985, it and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; were reportedly the two most widely pirated Commodore 64 programs. &quot;II Computing&quot; listed it seventh on the magazine&#x27;s list of top Apple II non-game, non-educational software as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data. In 1988, Broderbund announced that the company had sold more than one million copies, and that sales of the software comprised 4% of the entire United States software market in 1987. In April 1989, it was awarded a &quot;Diamond&quot; certification from the Software Publishers Association for sales above 500,000 units. The series comprised 29% of Broderbund revenue in fiscal year 1992.

&quot;Ahoy!&quot;â³s reviewer called the Commodore 64 version of The Print Shop &quot;one of the best thought out, easiest to use packages I&#x27;ve come across&quot;, reporting that he did not need to use the manual to produce his first greeting cards. He predicted that the software &quot;is destined to become one of the most popular packages for the Commodore 64&quot;. Agreeing on the documentation not being needed, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; concluded that The Print Shop was an &quot;easy-to-use, complete, fun&quot; way &quot;to do new things with your printer&quot;. &quot;II Computing&quot; criticized the Apple II version&#x27;s inflexible layout options and lack of print preview, but concluded that it &quot;is truly &#x27;a graphics utility for the rest of us&#x27;, encouraging creativity and self-expression ... you&#x27;ll want to use this program over and over again&quot;.

==The Print Shop Companion==
The Print Shop Companion, developed by Roland Gustafsson and released in 1985, added a calendar feature, an updated graphic editor, font and border editors, and a &quot;Creature Maker&quot; game, as well as an expanded library of fonts, borders, and graphics. Initially, to use the new fonts and borders in The Print Shop Companion had to modify the original program; subsequent releases of The Print Shop included built-in support for Companion.

In 1986, the first Apple Macintosh version was released. It featured graphics by Marney Morris and was the most powerful version available at the time. It was popular in schools and contained a unique feature with which graphics could be transferred to or from a MacPaint file.

Graphics libraries for The Print Shop came from Broderbund and other vendors. Libraries were produced for the original version and continued to be rolled out as late as the 1990s. User-produced graphics were also commonly distributed by various user groups, and even submitted to disk magazines, such as the &quot;Softdisk&quot; family of magazines.

==The New Print Shop and subsequent versions==
The New Print Shop came out in 1988 for Apple II and MS-DOS, and improved on the original. Print Shop Deluxe, for Mac, MS-DOS, and Windows, followed in 1993. Deluxe used a new all-graphical interface still found in Print Shop programs today and allowed for the creation of calendars. Print Shop Deluxe Companion added new modules and graphics, and the Ensemble version combined The Print Shop, the Companion, and several graphics libraries on one CD.

Many new versions of The Print Shop followed, such as Ensemble II. Now over 20 years old, Print Shop still generates printed greeting cards, banners, and signs. It offers new types of printed output, including CD and DVD labels and inserts, iPod skins, and photo book pages. For small-business users, it also offers projects such as business cards, letterheads, and presentations.

On January 15, 2010, a new version for the PC-supporting Windows 7 titled The Print Shop 2.0 was released, published by Encore, Inc. It is published in Standard, Deluxe, and Professional variants.

To address Windows 7 support for pre-2.0 projects, an incremental release to the old line, The Print Shop Version 2.1 was released in July 2010.

For macOS (formerly Mac OS X), the most recent version is 4.0, developed and published by Software MacKiev, and released in December 2017. An update to provide 64-bit compatibility (version 4.1) was released in December 2021.

==Reception==
&quot;Print Shop Deluxe&quot; was reviewed in the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Guide Book where it was praised for &quot;produc[ing] high-quality greeting-cards, signs, stationery, banners, calendars, gift tags and posters&quot;.

<doc id="925985" wikidata="Q1149921" url="?curid=925985" title="WWE Tough Enough">
<text>WWE Tough Enough is an American professional wrestling reality competition series that was produced by WWE, wherein participants undergo professional wrestling training and compete for a contract with WWE. There were two winners per season for the first three seasons, all of which aired on MTV. A fourth competition was held in 2004, with only a single winner, who was integrated into (at the time) UPN&#x27;s &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. As revealed in October 2010, the USA Network, revived &quot;Tough Enough&quot; to air it immediately prior to &quot;Raw&quot;, starting on April 4, 2011, a day after WrestleMania XXVII. The first three seasons were co-produced with MTV, while the revival is a co-production with Shed Media. Reruns of the 2011 season were broadcast on Universal HD, Oxygen and G4.

Past episodes of &quot;Tough Enough&quot; are available for streaming on the WWE Network.

== Development and original series ==
The idea of the show originally came from a deal the then-WWF made with MTV in spring of 2000. One part of a deal was to create a reality series where contestants compete to win a WWE contract, the winner being one male and one female.

===&quot;Tough Enough&quot;===
Maven Huffman and Nidia Guenard won the first season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. Only two contestants were actually cut from the competition; the others eliminated voluntarily exited. Of the final five contestants, four would eventually join the WWE. Nidia was released from WWE on November 3, 2004, while Maven was released on July 5, 2005.

The first season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot; was released on DVD in 2002, along with its soundtrack.

This season became available for viewing on the WWE Network on January 12, 2015.

====Aftermath====

He also appeared on the sixth season of The Surreal Life. Nidia Guenard would go on to manage Jamie Noble and compete in the women&#x27;s division. She was released by WWE in November 2004 and retired shortly afterwards. Christopher Nowinski would eventually make the main roster, where he was a two time WWE Hardcore Champion.

===&quot;Tough Enough 2&quot;===
The second season winners were Linda Miles and Jackie Gayda. The result offended members of the male finalists, who claimed that when they signed forms to compete on &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, the forms spoke of one male winner and one female winner. Eventually, Linda and Jackie were released on November 12, 2004 and July 5, 2005, respectively. Gayda later married wrestler Charlie Haas, but would later divorce in 2020.

Shad Gaspard, who would later become a member of the WWE tag team Cryme Tyme, was chosen to be one of the final 13 contestants on the show but, according to the show, failed a physical; he was subsequently replaced by Danny. Eventual season 3 winner John Hennigan (who went on to compete for the WWE as John Morrison) auditioned and survived the first cut down to 25 contestants, but, despite displaying well-tuned athletic ability, Hennigan&#x27;s arrogance irritated the judges. It would be another year before Hennigan would make the show. There were several other well known faces in the crowd who didn&#x27;t make the cut, but, eventually made a name for themselves in the business, including Shelly Martinez (known as Ariel in the WWE and as Salinas in TNA), Kia Stevens (known as Awesome Kong in TNA and as Kharma in WWE), former fitness model Kim Nielsen (who was known by her real name in WWE and as Desire in TNA, and who competed on season 13 of &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;), Jaxson Ryker and Ken Anderson (known as Mr. Kennedy in WWE) (both of whom later returned to WWE).

Order of Elimination:
* Episode 3: Aaron was cut because he could not physically catch up with the rest of the group&#x27;s speed. That caused him to pass out on the beach while exercising.

Morgan found success in Impact Wrestling, where he is a two time TNA World Tag Team Champion. Hawk Younkins would compete in one MMA match on September 18, 2004.

===&quot;Tough Enough III&quot;===
The third season was won by John Hennigan and Matt Cappotelli.

Melina Perez tried out for &quot;Tough Enough III&quot; and made it to the final 25, but was cut from the competition. During the tryouts she met John Hennigan, and they began a romantic relationship. Perez eventually received a WWE contract and worked as Melina on the  Smackdown (WWE brand) and Raw (WWE brand) shows. She went on to become the first &quot;Tough Enough&quot; contestant to win the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship and the WWE Divas Championship, which she held respectively three and two times, making her the most successful female &quot;Tough Enough&quot; contestant to enter WWE. Perez was eventually released from WWE on August 5, 2011. Both Shawn Daivari and Daniel Puder are seen on film during audition episode. Both made it to the final 75, but were cut before they could make it to the training facility. Daivari was later hired by WWE to team with Muhammad Hassan, while Puder was able to join and eventually win the fourth season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;.

Hardcore Holly made a controversial guest appearance on one episode of the show, where he stiffed Cappotelli during a training match, leaving him brutalized, bleeding, crying and requesting to leave the program; the incident was discussed on February 8, 2003 episode of &quot;WWE Confidential&quot;.

Hennigan left WWE in November 2011 and also found success outside of WWE in other promotions such as Impact Wrestling, Lucha Underground and Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide between 2012 and 2019.

Cappotelli was developing his talent further in WWE development territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), but was diagnosed with a brain tumor in December 2005, forcing him to step away from wrestling and relinquish his OVW Heavyweight Championship. The tumor was removed in 2007, and it was unknown whether Cappotelli would ever return to professional wrestling. In July 2017, Cappotelli announced that he was diagnosed with grade IV glioblastoma multiforme. He died on June 29, 2018, at the age of 38.

====Lisa incident====
In the cover story from the October 5, 2002 issue of the &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter&quot;, it was revealed that contestant &quot;Lisa&quot; was removed from the show after what was referred to as a &quot;psychotic breakdown.&quot; After being left at the house while the other contestants went out to dinner, she began throwing herself against the walls of the house, eventually breaking into the hidden MTV control room and working her way onto the roof. After being talked down by producers, she was committed to a hospital facility to receive psychiatric treatment. Her parents flew in from New Mexico to pick her up, but she physically attacked them, claiming she did not know them. She then escaped custody inside LAX, shutting down a wing of the airport until she was located. Again, she was hospitalized, but she was able to check herself out shortly after. She then contacted &quot;Tough Enough&quot; producers, claiming she was ready to return to the show. Producers informed her she had been removed from the competition due to her actions. The other contestants (and, subsequently, the audience) were initially told that Lisa simply decided wrestling &quot;wasn&#x27;t the right career for her.&quot; Lisa then reemerged in Louisville, Kentucky, at the Ohio Valley Wrestling training center, claiming that trainer Al Snow and producer John &quot;Big&quot; Gaburick had sent her for additional training, both in the ring and to learn further about the structure of the developmental territory system. At a series of shows in California in September 2002, she managed to talk her way backstage and was even allowed to assist with the pyrotechnics for the wrestlers&#x27; entrances at a TV taping. One source claimed that she had a face-to-face conversation with Vince McMahon, who was apparently unaware of her status with the &quot;Tough Enough&quot; program. Soon after, her photograph was circulated to security personnel, and she was barred from any backstage areas.

===&quot;$1,000,000 Tough Enough&quot; (season 4)===
The fourth &quot;Tough Enough&quot; competition was conducted as part of WWE&#x27;s &quot;SmackDown!&quot; brand between October and December 2004 in response to &quot;Raw&quot; holding the first annual &quot;Raw&quot; Diva Search&quot; contest. The prize was a $1 million professional wrestling contract split evenly over four years with only the first year guaranteed. The winner of the fourth series, announced on December 14, 2004, and televised on December 16, 2004, was Daniel Puder, an American professional mixed martial artist. Puder competed in his second WWE pay-per-view event on January 30, 2005 as the third entrant in the 2005 Royal Rumble match. Soon after, he was sent to OVW before eventually being released in September 2005.

====Contestants====
* Chris Nawrocki
* Daniel Puder (winner)
* Daniel Rodimer
* John Meyer Jr.
* Justice Smith 
* Mike Mizanin (runner-up, eventually signed by WWE in 2006, and wrestles as The Miz)
* Nick Mitchell (signed by WWE as Mitch)
* Ryan Reeves (signed by WWE as Skip Sheffield, later as Ryback)

====Daniel Puder shoot incident====
On November 4, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, taped in St. Louis, Missouri, during an unscripted segment of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, Kurt Angle, a former American amateur wrestler and 1996 Olympic gold medalist, challenged the finalists through a squat thrust competition. Chris Nawrocki won the competition, and the prize Nawrocki won was a match against Angle. Angle quickly took Nawrocki down, breaking his ribs, then made him tap out with a &quot;neck crank&quot;. After Angle defeated Nawrocki, Angle challenged the other finalists. Puder accepted Angle&#x27;s challenge. Angle and Puder wrestled for position, with Angle taking Puder down; however, in the process, Puder locked Angle in a &quot;kimura lock&quot;. With Puder on his back and Angle&#x27;s arm locked in the &quot;kimura&quot;, Angle attempted a pin, one of two referees in the ring, Jim Korderas, quickly counted three to end the bout, despite the fact that Puder&#x27;s shoulders weren&#x27;t fully down on the mat, bridging up at two. Puder later claimed he would have snapped Angle&#x27;s arm, thus making Angle tap out on national television, if Korderas had not ended the match. Dave Meltzer and Dave Scherer gave these following comments:

====Aftermath====
Mike Mizanin signed a developmental contract with WWE and made his main roster debut in 2006 as The Miz and became the first and the only &quot;Tough Enough&quot; contestant to win the WWE Championship and to headline WrestleMania. Additionally, he has held multiple midcard and tag team championships in WWE, and is one of only two wrestlers in WWE history to complete the Grand Slam twice.

Ryan Reeves signed a developmental contract with WWE. He continued working for Ohio Valley Wrestling until early 2007 when he was released by WWE. He later resigned a contact with WWE in late 2008 working for Florida Championship Wrestling. He then participated in the first season of &quot;NXT&quot; in early 2010 under the ring name Skip Sheffield, and became one of the original members of the faction The Nexus. He resurfaced on the main roster in early 2012 under the ring name Ryback, and headlined five pay-per-view events, three of those for the WWE Championship. He is also a former WWE Intercontinental Champion. He would remain with WWE until August 2016.

Daniel Rodimer signed a developmental contract with WWE, and later wrestled on &quot;Heat&quot; as Dan Rodman in 2007. He retired from wrestling in late 2007.

Nick Mitchell signed a developmental contract with WWE. He made his debut on the main roster in January 2006 as Mitch, a member of the male cheerleader group The Spirit Squad. As a member of the Spirit Squad, he is a former World Tag Team Champion, which he won under the Freebird Rule. He was released by WWE in May 2007 and retired completely from wrestling.

Justice Smith would later appear in the 2008 revival of American Gladiators, using his first name as his gladiator name.

Marty Wright, who lied about his age during the auditions and was disqualified, later signed with WWE and competed as The Boogeyman.

During the tryouts, Brian Danovich suffered a torn pectoral muscle during the bench press but then went on to complete the assault course in its entirely while carrying the injury. After withdrawing from the event, then Head of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis offered him a developmental contract on the spot though he was eventually released after numerous injuries without appearing on the main roster. He would resurface in June 2018 with a wrestling internet radio show called &quot;Wrestling With Passion&quot; on Action VR Network on Mixlr, which lasted only five episodes before his untimely death on August 9, 2018, at the age of 38 by committing suicide.

Andrew Hankinson tried out for this season but failed to make it to the finals. However, he was signed to a WWE developmental contract and later competed in WWE as Festus and Luke Gallows until his WWE release in November 2010. He would go on to compete for Impact Wrestling as a member of the Aces &amp; Eights and New Japan Pro-Wrestling teaming with Karl Anderson as members of the Bullet Club. In 2016, Gallows returned to WWE with Anderson as tag team champions. They were both released in April 2020, then rehired in October 2022.

A DVD of this season was released in 2005.

== Revival ==

===Season 5===
On October 18, 2010, the television website Deadline Hollywood reported that USA Network was considering expanding into reality programming with a revival of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. The website also reported that the show was expected to &quot;run in tandem with USA&#x27;s &quot;WWE Raw&quot; series.&quot; On January 3, 2011, both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and WWE further confirmed the revival, revealing that the revived series would begin airing Monday nights beginning on April 4, 2011, following &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, and a day after WrestleMania XXVII. The following week, &quot;Tough Enough&quot; aired during its planned time slot before &quot;WWE Raw&quot;. The revived series is a co-production with Shed Media.

&quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin served as the show&#x27;s season 5 host while Booker T, Trish Stratus, and Bill DeMott served as trainers. According to USA Network&#x27;s episode guide, the 2011 season is referred to as &quot;Season 1&quot;, therefore making no reference to its prior runs on other networks. In addition, although the premise of this show is similar to that of &quot;WWE NXT&quot;, &quot;Tough Enough&quot; season 5 ran concurrently with &quot;NXT&quot; and did not replace it.

Similar to the reality series &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, several episodes concluded with a voiceover of Austin&#x27;s thoughts on the eliminated contestant as he goes to his office and hangs their belt on the wall.

<text>The Situation Room is an intelligence management complex on the ground floor of the West Wing of the White House. While the name suggests it is a single room, it is in fact a operations suite consisting of a duty watch station and three secure conference rooms. It is run by about 130 National Security Council staff for the use of the president of the United States, chief of staff, national security advisor, homeland security advisor, and other senior advisors for monitoring and dealing with crises, as well as conducting secure communications with outside (often overseas) persons. The Situation Room has secure, advanced communications equipment for the president to maintain command and control of U.S. forces around the world.

The Situation Room has been upgraded several times, most recently in late 2023.

==Origin and staff==

The concept of a âWar Roomâ in the White House originated with President McKinley in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. During McKinleyâs tenure it contained telegraph systems and maps.

The Situation Room was created in 1961 on the order of President John F. Kennedy after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion was attributed to a lack of current information. The facility has secure communications systems; the wood panels over the walls hide audio, video, and other systems.

The Situation Room staff is about 130 people, including five watch teams, which monitor domestic and international events; a travel support team; video operators; and communications technicians. Each watch team includes six duty officers, a communications assistant, and a senior intelligence analyst, though the number and composition of the teams may vary, depending on shift requirements and workload. The teams are staffed from a pool of senior personnel from agencies in the intelligence community and from the military. These members are chosen from heavily vetted nominations made by their parent agencies and are apolitical. They stand watch round the clock, monitoring world events and keeping senior White House staff apprised of significant incidents. The current director of the Situation Room is Marc Gustafson.

==Functions==


The purpose of the Situation Room is to provide current intelligence and crisis support to the NSC staff, the national security advisor, and the president. The room is a round-the-clock meeting-place for sensitive information flowing to and from the White House. It is also the funnel through which most communications, especially classified information, pass when the president is not in residenceâan essential link, giving the traveling White House access to all the information from Washington&#x27;s national-security community.

The day begins with the watch team&#x27;s preparation of the Morning Book. Prepared for the president, the vice president, and most senior White House staff, the Morning Book contains a copy of the National Intelligence Daily, the State Department&#x27;s Morning Summary, and diplomatic cables and intelligence reports. The Book is usually in the car when the national security advisor is picked up for work. The morning routine also includes the President&#x27;s Daily Brief, prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; this is delivered to the president and other NSC principals by an intelligence officer, who briefs them about the document.

In addition, the Watch Teams produce morning and evening summaries of select material. These summaries of interagency issues are sent electronically to the NSC staff.

The Situation Room staff also provides alerts on new events to NSC and White House personnel. Responsible for informing the president is the national security adviser. Later, a written &quot;Sit Room Note&quot; is prepared, summarizing the event with current reports from other centers, perhaps including a photo, diagram, or map. The task of the Situation Room staff is to ensure that the president and national security advisor are informed not only of the current situation but also of how the situation is being portrayed by the news media.

Another typical Situation Room activity is arranging the president&#x27;s phone calls and other sensitive communications with foreign heads of state. This includes scheduling such calls at each end, providing interpreters where necessary, and ensuring appropriate security and record-keeping. In this function, the Situation Room coordinates closely with the White House Communications Agency.

==2006â2007 renovations==

The only thorough renovation of the Situation Room took place in 2006 and 2007. Until then, the room used cathode-ray tubes for monitors, fax for communication, and computers and telephones of the mid 1980s. The room also had a small kitchen with no sink. Encrypted audio-visual equipment was also unreliable and would sometimes go black, &quot;prompting a presidential outburst&quot;. The Situation Room was once described as &quot;uncomfortable, unaesthetic and essentially oppressive&quot;; others termed the complex before renovation &quot;something of a low-tech dungeon&quot;.

Planning for the renovation began before the September 11, 2001, attacks; the project became more urgent afterward.

Renovations began in August 2006, when the Situation Room complex was gutted down to bricks and bare floor. Rebuilding took about four and a half months and was disruptive, particularly to White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten, whose office was directly above it. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Staff members described sitting in his room and hearing ear-piercing noise or watching water ripple in glasses on his desk as the floor shook.&quot; The renovation yielded several pieces from decades before, including coaxial cables; columns; and a frame window from a sunken courtyard from the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The renovations allowed the use of the room to expand from only the National Security Council to include the Homeland Security Council and the office of the White House chief of staff. A secure direct feed to Air Force One was added. 

Sensors were installed in the ceilings to detect cellular signals to prevent unauthorized communications and bugging by mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and other devices. Before the renovation, the Secret Service confiscated cell-phones but had no other means of preventing smuggled communication devices. 

The renovation was formally completed by mid-May 2007. On May 17, 2007, President George W. Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair participated in a video conference with members of their Iraq teams from the newly renovated Situation Room. The following day, President Bush officially opened the newly refurbished Situation Room in a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Two of the rooms in the complex were preserved, these being the main conference room and the secure video transmission site. They are currently located at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and the George W. Bush Presidential Center.

==2023 renovation==

The Situation Room complex was upgraded in late 2023 after a yearlong renovation for a cost of $50 million. The walls were made with sustainably harvested wood, with new monitors installed into them. Faster servers, updated audio equipment, and new computers were also included in the renovation. New leather chairs were added in each room, replacing worn furniture. White House senior staff were given the opportunity to weigh in on the design of the facility. 

The walls, ceilings, and floors were refitted with a modular design that can allow easy access to technology behind them. This is expected to allow easier renovation in the future.

<doc id="925994" wikidata="Q1686583" url="?curid=925994" title="Jehuda Reinharz">
<text>Jehuda Reinharz (born August 1, 1944) served as President of Brandeis University from 1994â2010. He was the Richard Koret Professor of Modern Jewish History and Director of the Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry at Brandeis. He is the president and CEO of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation. On September 25, 2009, Reinharz announced his retirement as President of Brandeis, but at the request of the Board of Trustees, he stayed on until a replacement could be hired. On January 1, 2011, Reinharz became president and CEO of the Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel Foundation.

==Biography==
Jehuda Reinharz was born in Haifa in the British Mandate of Palestine, now the State of Israel. For three years (1958-1961), he attended high school in Essen, Germany, and moved with his family to the United States as a teenager in 1961. He completed his high school education in Newark, New Jersey. Reinharz earned concurrent bachelor&#x27;s degrees: a Bachelor of Science (B.S) from Columbia University and a Bachelor of Religious Education (B.R.E) from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in medieval Jewish history from Harvard University in 1968 and his Ph.D. in modern Jewish history from Brandeis University in 1972.

His wife, Shulamit Reinharz, was the Jacob Potofsky Professor of Sociology at Brandeis University and founded and directed the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute and the Women&#x27;s Studies Research Center. She retired from her professorship and directorship of the Institutes in 2017. They live in Brookline, Massachusetts. They have two adult daughters, Yael and Naomi.

==Academic career==
In 1972, Reinharz became the first professor of Jewish history at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he created the interdisciplinary program that formed the basis for the University&#x27;s Frankel Center for Judaic Studies. He became a full professor at the University of Michigan in 1980.

In 1982, he became the Richard Koret Professor of Modern Jewish History in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University. Two years later, he was named Director of the Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry at Brandeis, and eight years later he founded the Jacob and Libby Goodman Institute for the Study of Zionism and Israel. From 1991 to 1994, Professor Reinharz served as Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs.

Reinharz was announced as the University&#x27;s 7th president on March 2, 1994, succeeding Samuel O. Thier. During Reinharz&#x27;s 17-year tenure, the university underwent major physical changes including the construction of the Village Residence Hall, Abraham Shapiro Academic Complex, Carl and Ruth Shapiro Campus Center, Carl Shapiro Science Center, Carl Shapiro Admissions Center, Mandel Center for the Humanities, Mandel Center for Studies in Jewish Education, and many other major capital improvements. He raised $1.2 billion during his presidency and quadrupled the endowment, from $194 million to $772 million.

Reinharz announced his resignation as President of Brandeis University at midnight on September 25, 2009, after serving the Brandeis community for seventeen years. He stayed on as President until a successor was selected and ready to assume office. On January 1, 2011, Reinharz was officially replaced by Frederick M. Lawrence, and on that date, he became president of the Mandel Foundation. Upon stepping down, he made a $5 million personal gift to Brandeis for scholarships and fellowships.

==Awards and recognition==
Reinharz is twice the recipient of the President of Israel Prize, awarded by the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) in 1990 and 2024, in recognition of his scholarly publications. He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995 and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1999. He twice received the National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship to enable him to pursue his research. He also received a Guggenheim Research Fellowship.

In 1998, Reinharz was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve on the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States.

Reinharz is the recipient of honorary doctorates from Hebrew Union College, the Jewish Theological Seminary, Fairfield University, Ben Gurion University, Weizmann Institute of Science, Brandeis University, Hebrew College, Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

In 2017, Reinharz was elected chairman of the International Board of the Weizmann Institute in Israel and served until 2020. In 2024 he was elected as life member of the international Board. He also serves on many other Boards in the United States and Israel.

<text>James (Jim) Tarbell is an American politician of the Charter Party, who was a member of the city council and vice-mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio. By mayoral proclamation, Jim Tarbell holds the title &quot;Mr. Cincinnati&quot; for life.

== Early life and education ==
Tarbell&#x27;s family moved from a small Ohio town to the Hyde Park neighborhood of Cincinnati in 1946. He attended St. Xavier High School and graduated from Withrow High School in 1960 before attending the Lowell Technological Institute in Lowell, Massachusetts. He returned to Cincinnati in 1967.

== Business career ==
Tarbell opened the Ludlow Garage, a local concert venue, in September 1969 and operated it until its closing in 1971, featuring artists such as Grand Funk Railroad, Spirit, Santana, Elvin Bishop, The Kinks, Humble Pie, Sons of Champlin, Cold Blood, Boz Scaggs, James Gang, Bo Didley, Iggy and the Stooges, MC5, Fairport Convention, Taj Mahal, NRBQ, Commander Cody, Herbie Mann, the Staple Singers, Alice Cooper, The Lemon Pipers, Neil Young and the Allman Brothers, who recorded a live album there. From 1976 to 1998, he owned Arnold&#x27;s Bar and Grill, the oldest continuously operated bar in Cincinnati.

== Political career ==
In 1997, Tarbell began his political career by campaigning in his now well-known top hat and tails. He was first appointed to Cincinnati City Council in 1998 to replace the retiring Bobbie L. Sterne, was elected in 1999, and re-elected in 2001, 2003 and 2005. Until 2003, when Christopher Smitherman won a seat on the council, Tarbell was the sole Charterite on the council. In 2005, Tarbell was appointed Vice Mayor by Mark Mallory, the newly elected Mayor of Cincinnati. Because of term limits, Tarbell could not run for re-election in the November 2007 election.

In March 2010, Tarbell ran for Hamilton County Commissioner for the first time. In September 2014, Tarbell announced that he was running for Hamilton County Commissioner again, this time as a write-in candidate.

<text>Middleton is a largely residential suburb of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England and historically a village in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It is situated on a hill south of Leeds city centre and north north-west of London.

It sits in the Middleton Park ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds South parliamentary constituency. The population of Middleton Park ward - which includes Belle Isle - was 26,228 at the 2011 Census.

Middleton was occupied before the Norman Conquest and recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Mildetone&quot;. It developed as a manorial estate and its owners began to exploit the coal seams that outcropped within its boundaries. At the start of the Industrial Revolution a wooden wagonway was built to link the coal pits to Leeds. The colliery agent, John Blenkinsop designed an iron railway and its first steam-powered locomotive which was built by Matthew Murray in Holbeck. The coal mines on which the local economy was based lasted until 1968 and the railway is preserved and run by a trust after operating for 200 years.

Middleton Park, a remnant of the manorial estate, contains a large area of ancient woodland and parts of it, where coal was mined, are designated a scheduled ancient monument. It was the location of Middleton Hall and Middleton Lodge, homes to the local gentry.

The village developed along Town Street, a school, chapel and church were built in the 19th century but after the land was acquired by Leeds Council in 1920 a large council housing estate was built on the flatter land to the south, completely changing the rural nature of the settlement. Early transport was provided by a tram line and the Leeds Ring Road was built to Middleton. After the colliery closed the area began to decline and by 2001, had areas of multiple deprivation and high levels of unemployment and anti-social behaviour. The Middleton Regeneration Board has been established with the remit of addressing these issues.

==History==

The name Middleton is derived from the Old English &quot;middel&quot;-&quot;tun&quot;, in this case the middle settlement or farm on the road from Morley to Rothwell.

Flint and bronze weapons have been discovered in the neighbourhood showing evidence of habitation during the Palaeolithic and Bronze Ages. Roman discoveries were made in 1607 and 1823. Middleton was mentioned as &quot;Mildentone&quot; and &quot;Mildetone&quot; in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as having three carucates of land much of which was woodland. The land was given to Ilbert de Lacy who had a castle at Pontefract. Middleton Park is a remnant of the manorial estate which existed after the Norman Conquest. In the 13th century the boundary between Middleton and Beeston became the focus of a protracted dispute over where it lay in the dense woodland which covered the area. The dispute between William Grammary and Adam de Beeston was settled in 1209 by single combat and resulted in the construction of a boundary bank and ditch, a stretch of which can still be seen in Middleton Woods.

The Creppings were lords of the manor followed by the Leigh or Legh family. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, held the manor from 1363 to 1370 and Simon Simeon, whose will mentioned coal mines, from 1401 to 1406. The Leighs held the manor for much of the time between 1300 until 1697 when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling of Felling in Durham. The Leighs once occupied New Hall whose name is recalled in the street names in the area. William Gascoigne, who invented the micrometer and died fighting for the Royalists at Marston Moor in 1644, was another resident of New Hall.

Middleton Hall on Town Street was built in the 18th century for the Brandlings but they chose to live mainly in Durham. Charles John Brandling of Gosforth House, the Member of Parliament for Newcastle between 1798 and 1812 and for Northumberland from 1820 until 1826, married Henrietta Armitage of Middleton. The Brandlings appointed John Blenkinsop to manage their collieries in Middleton and he was the hall&#x27;s occupant in 1809. The hall was destroyed in a fire in 1962. The gate-house serving Middleton Hall still stands today on Town Street, alongside St. Mary&#x27;s Church and graveyard and original public pathway into the then private, Middleton Park.

In 1760 the Brandlings built a new residence, Middleton Lodge, designed by James Paine. It was situated in what is now the park possibly on the site the original manor house. Members of the family lived there until 1860 including R.H. Brandling who donated land on Town Street on which the church is built. The Brandling&#x27;s fortunes declined and the estate was sold to the Middleton Estate &amp; Colliery Company in 1862. William Henry Maude, a partner in the company, occupied the house with his sister in 1871. He died in a carriage accident in the park in 1911. His sister remained at Middleton Lodge after the land had been acquired by the council until her death in 1933 after which the house became the headquarters of Middleton Golf Club. Middleton Lodge was demolished in 1996.

===Industrial history===

There is evidence of coal mining in the Middle Ages in the shaft mounds, waggonways and similar archaeological features resulting from early mining activity in Middleton Woods. Before the 17th century the pits were bell pits and adits or day holes dug horizontally into the hill sides where the coal seam outcropped. In 1669 Frances Conyers of New Hall had &quot;cole pits&quot; in Middleton. The pits were small and numerous and many worked for a short time. Gin pits using horses to turn the windlass were the next development and the deeper pits had brick-lined shafts and wooden headgear for hauling tubs of coal and miners out of the workings. This type of mine was in operation when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling whose family owned collieries in Durham. Brandling&#x27;s 1,200 acre Middleton estate supplied coal to Leeds but was disadvantaged in the trade by poor roads. Deep mining arrived with the advent of steam engines to pump water out of the mines and keep the workings dry making it possible to raise coal from greater depths. In 1780 a Newcomen engine was installed at Middleton and by 1808 the mine employed 90 hewers and 60 putters. The market for coal grew as Leeds and its industries expanded.

The Middleton Railway, founded in 1758, is the oldest continuously working railway in Britain to be established by an act of Parliament; the first such act in England. The railway, owned by Charles Brandling, (1733â1802) was a horse drawn wooden waggonway linking the collieries at Middleton to Cassons Close near Leeds Bridge in the centre of Leeds. In 1810 John Blenkinsop, Brandling&#x27;s agent at Middleton, was looking for cheaper ways of moving coal to Leeds. He designed the rack railway and Matthew Murray built the first Middleton Railway locomotive, &quot;Salamanca&quot;, at his Round Foundry in Holbeck. The locomotive&#x27;s first run, reported in The Leeds Mercury on 27 June 1812, was &quot;witnessed by thousands of spectators and crowned a complete success...&quot;. Three more locomotives were built. The Middleton Railway locomotives had a toothed cog wheel which meshed into a rack on the side of the rail, as it was felt this would provide the engines with a better grip when hauling coal wagons.

Before 1840, women and children were employed in coal mines and there were frequent accidents. The worst disaster occurred in 1825 at the Gosforth Pit, named after the Brandling&#x27;s Durham estate, where an explosion of firedamp caused 24 deaths; the oldest a collier aged 48 and the youngest a child of seven.

Broom Pit was the deepest at , and longest-lasting of the Middleton collieries. In 1896 the Middleton Broom, Little and Middleton Main Pits, all managed by John Neal, employed over 600 workers. By 1923 just the Broom Pit was working, employing more than 1,000 men and supplying coking, gas and household coal and fireclay to the brickworks. Nearly 900 men were employed there in 1940. At the time the collieries were nationalised in 1947, the workforce had reduced to 436. Operations at the pit ended in 1968 as the productivity of the colliery declined.

===20th century===

In 1919, the grounds of Middleton Lodge were leased by Leeds Council for use as a public park. The rural nature of the area changed soon after 1 April 1920 when the township was incorporated into the County Borough of Leeds. Leeds Council acquired land to construct &quot;a vast low-density corporation built cottage estate with circuses and avenues&quot;. The houses were built using bricks from the fireclay works at Broom Pit on land once used for agriculture including West Farm and parts of Sissons Farm. By 1934, 2,377 council houses had been built and the housing estate was considered to be a &quot;garden suburb&quot;, but was found to be remote and lacking in facilities by the residents. An early resident was Keith Waterhouse, who wrote about his childhood exploits as the only member of the &quot;Middleton Hiking Club&quot;, in his book, &quot;City Lights&quot;.

The area attracted more social housing when the Westwoods and Manor Farm estates were developed in the 1960s. A large private housing estate was built at Sharp Lane after 1972 and 1,300 houses were built at Leeds New Forest Village after 2005.

==Governance==

Middleton was a township and chapelry dependent on Holy Trinity Church in the ancient parish of Rothwell in the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became an ecclesiastical parish after 1849. In 1866 Middleton became a separate civil parish. Middleton was part of the Great Preston Gilbert Union from 1809 until 1862, which provided a workhouse and poor relief for the parishes within its jurisdiction. The Gilbert Unions were exempt from the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 but disbanded in 1862 and after that Middleton became part of the Kirkstall Poor Law Union until 1869, when it joined the Hunslet Poor Law Union until 1920. On 1 April 1920 the parish was abolished and merged with Hunslet. In 1911 the parish had a population of 1207.

Middleton is in the Middleton Park electoral ward and is represented on Leeds City Council by three councillors representing the revival Social Democratic Party (SDP), who have held seats in Middleton since 2022. Before then Middleton had only had Labour Party councillors.

The Middleton Park ward is in the Leeds Central parliamentary constituency. At the 2019 general election the seat was held by Hilary Benn who represents the Labour Party with 61.7% of the vote. For the 2024 general election it is due to be moved into the Leeds South constituency. 

==Geography==
Middleton is south of Leeds city centre and north north-west of London. It is situated on a hill and occupies most of a plateau which falls away sharply to the west (towards Dewsbury Road) and in the park to the north of Town Street from where there are extensive views towards the city centre. A height AOD is reached at the western end of Town Street and within the park are two steep-sided valleys with small streams separated by a tongue of land, which meet at AOD, its lowest point. The underlying geology is the coal measures and a bed of fireclay. Several coal seams outcrop in Middleton Park and between them are sandstones and shales.

The township covered about 1700 acres, of which 450 are woodland known as Middleton Woods and contain the largest area of ancient woodland remaining in Leeds. The old village was a ribbon development along Town Street which runs westâeast along a ridge and Middleton housing estate occupies flattish land to the south. The high point of Middleton is by the water tower at the western end of Town Street. Middleton is in an area surrounded by three motorways, the M62 motorway to the south, the M1 to the east and the M621 to the north.

==Demography==

In 2010, the Middleton Park ward which includes Belle Isle, had 27,487 inhabitants of which 52.2% were female and 47.8% male. 21.5% of the residents were aged 15 or under compared with an England average of 18.7%. Life expectancy for males and females at 76.57 years is more than three years less than the 79.91 years for the rest of Leeds. In 2001, most residents, 96.3%, identified as white British with 71.6% identifying as Christian and over 18% having no religion. Most houses are in the lowest-rated Council Tax bands A and B. In April 2012, 1493 people were claiming Jobseekers Allowance which at 8.3% was nearly double the Leeds&#x27; average. Middleton Park ward contained 10,649 households in 2001. There were 1,201 households with dependent children and no adult in employment. Of the 1,410 of lone-parent households with dependent children, most were women (1,307) and most had no job. Male lone-parents numbered 95 of which 39 were in full-time employment. Nearly half the households, 5,170, had no car or van.

While all recorded crime was below the Leeds&#x27; average, criminal damage was substantially higher and nearly twice the England average. Most crimes committed in the area are violent or sexual offences, anti-social behaviour, criminal damage or arson.

===Population change===

==Economy==

After the closure of the largest employer in the area, Broom Pit, in 1968, a process of decline set in. Middleton is now primarily residential with areas of multiple deprivation and as a consequence, the Middleton Regeneration Board was set up to address concerns including reducing unemployment over a ten-year period.

Facilities in the area include the St Georges Centre, a multi-use building that houses health services including a minor injuries unit and drop-in centre, a library, and a neighbourhood housing office.

Middleton has two main shopping areas, at Middleton Park Circus and the Middleton District Shopping Centre. At Middleton Park Circus there is an Aldi supermarket (opened in Spring 2014 on the site of the former Middleton Arms pub), a Sainsburys Local supermarket, Boots chemist, a Post Office and several independent traders. Also in Spring 2014, Asda opened a supermarket next to the Middleton District Centre; this should provide over 300 jobs. The District Centre itself has several traders but had failed to develop.

==Landmarks==
Middleton Park, once the private estate of the lords of the manor of Middleton, is owned by Wade&#x27;s Charity and leased to Leeds City Council for a peppercorn rent. It has been one of Leeds many public parks since 1919 covering an area of nearly a square mile, , of which are of ancient woodland. There is a small lake, recreational areas and a golf course. The reclaimed site of Middleton Broom Pit was incorporated into the park. Two areas of the park, comprising ancient waggonways which are now surfaced footpaths, earthworks and remains of underground workings and shaft mounds, have been designated a scheduled ancient monument.

The Middleton Railway, a preserved heritage steam railway, operates from headquarters and museum at Moor Road Hunslet to Park Halt. It is operated by volunteers. From Middleton, Park Halt is accessed by a footpath that was originally a waggonway. The railway celebrated its 200th anniversary of steam haulage in 2012.

On Town Street, a row of brick-built cottages with stone slate roofs, known as &quot;Top of the town&quot; was built in the mid 18th century. The 19th-century St Mary&#x27;s Church, with its contemporary lych gate and flanking walls are all Grade II listed buildings. In the churchyard is a war memorial erected in 1920. To the west of the war memorial is a gatehouse which stood at an old entrance to the hall grounds. The distinctive white concrete water tower at the high point of the hill is at the south west corner of the park on Town Street.

==Transport==

To serve the growing population of the council estate, the Middleton Light Railway, an electric tramway, was built in 1925 by Leeds Corporation Tramways. The tramway from Leeds ran parallel to the colliery line to Hunslet Moor staithes and then headed south through Middleton Woods to a terminus on the Ring Road. As the Middleton tramway largely ran separately to the road it could run at higher speeds than other tram routes in the city; a specific fleet of trams with bogies for a smoother ride were procured for the running of the Middleton service and for most of its operation the Middleton route was not integrated with other city services. The tramway was made into a circular route in 1949 when it was extended to Belle Isle Road and Balm Road in Hunslet. The tramway closed in 1959. Its route through the park is now a footpath.

The original plans for the Leeds Supertram included a line to Middleton, but they were amended to save on costs and the later plans stipulated a terminus at Stourton. The scheme was axed when government funding was withdrawn.

Public transport in Middleton is coordinated by West Yorkshire Metro. Middleton is served by several bus routes operated by Arriva Yorkshire and First Leeds, with buses to Leeds city centre, Wakefield, Roundhay, Morley and the White Rose Centre.

==Education==
Teachers were employed in the village in 1811 and a Sunday school, built by the Brandlings, providing education in reading and writing, was established by 1833 and used for worship before the church was built. The 1833 school was the premises of a national school in 1845. It became Middleton St Mary&#x27;s C of E School and moved to a new site in 1972. There was a secondary school named &quot;Middleton Park High School&quot; on Acre Road in Middleton, but this was closed on 31 August 1999 despite a challenge in the High Court over the decision to close the school.

Other schools in Middleton are Middleton Primary School, in the centre of the housing estate which opened in the 1920s, St Philip&#x27;s Catholic Primary and Nursery School which opened in 1941, and Westwood Primary School.

In the Middleton Park ward in 2012, at the Foundation Stage (3 to 5 years), 51.6% of children have a good level of achievement and by the end of Key Stage 2 (11 years) 69.6% of pupils achieved Level 4 or better. By the age of 16, 32.8% of pupils achieved five or more A-C grades including English and Maths in GCSEs, far less than the Leeds average of 53.4%. In secondary education, 16.5% of pupils are persistent absentees missing 15% or more sessions during the school year and 12.4% of 16- to 18-year-olds are not in employment, education or training.

==Religion==

Middleton was a chapelry of the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Rothwell. In 1497 a chantry chapel was endowed by Gilbert Leygh and dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, it was closed at the time of the Reformation though the building is extant and now a private residence.
R.H. Brandling of Middleton Lodge gave land on Town Street on which to build a church and parsonage in 1845. St Mary&#x27;s Church was built in 1846 to designs by R. D. Chantrell, who also designed Leeds Parish Church. The church and its lych gate are designated Grade II listed buildings. The church originally had a tall spire which was taken down because of mining subsidence in 1939. There is a tradition that local miners gave either a week&#x27;s wages or a week&#x27;s work towards the cost of its construction.

Out of the parish, two more parishes were created as the population increased after the Middleton council estate was built. In 1921 the church acquired a site on the Middleton housing estate on which to build. In 1925 a mission church was built off Middleton Park Avenue. The Church of St Cross was built in 1933 and became a parish church in 1935 with about two thirds of the Middleton housing estate in its boundaries. In the 1930s the Belle Isle housing estate was begun. The Church of St John and St Barnabus was built in Belle Isle in 1939 but not consecrated until 1947 because of the war. This church became a parish church.

Local Methodists reputedly met in a house on Town Street until a chapel was built in the 1860s. Middleton Methodist Chapel was built in 1896 replacing a chapel built 30 years earlier by the Wesleyans. It was designed by Howdill and Howdill and built in brick. It has a tower to the north west and large west window. The interior survives largely unaltered and has a barrel-vaulted ceiling. There is a Baptist church on Middleton Park Avenue. St Philip&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, a modern building, is situated on St Philip&#x27;s Avenue.

==Sport==
A municipal golf club opened in 1933 at Middleton Lodge with an 18-hole course in the park. Middleton Leisure Centre offers a range of sporting and fitness activities.

Middleton Park FC offers football coaching and has community teams for all age groups, from 18 months old to adults. Rugby Union is played by Leeds Corinthians, who have a ground and clubhouse by the Middleton District Centre.
Crown Green Bowling is represented by two clubs, one in Middleton Park with two greens and the other in Acre Close was originally the Middleton Tenants Bowling Club that changed its name to the Community Bowling Club when the old Tenants Hall was demolished in 2010 and a new one built.

<text>An automat is a type of fast-food restaurant where food and drink are served through a vending machine, typically without waitstaff. The world&#x27;s first automat, Quisisana, opened in Berlin, Germany in 1895.

== By country ==
===Germany===

The first documented automat was Quisisana, which opened in 1895 in Berlin, Germany. In 1904, a similar restaurant opened in Breslau.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, in addition to vending machines that sell prepared food, many restaurants also use food ticket machines (). This process involves purchasing a meal ticket from a vending machine, which is then presented to a server who prepares and serves the meal.

Kaitenzushi restaurants, which serve sushi on conveyor belts, are also common in Japan.

=== Netherlands ===
Automats () provide a variety of typical Dutch fried fast food, such as frikandellen and croquettes, as well as hamburgers and sandwiches from vending machines which are back-loaded from a kitchen.

FEBO is the best-known chain of Dutch automats, with some outlets open 24 hours a day. 

=== United States ===
The first automat in the United States was opened by food services company Horn &amp; Hardart on June 12, 1902, at 818 Chestnut St. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Inspired by Max Sielaff&#x27;s automat restaurants in Berlin, they were among the first 47 restaurants (and the first outside of Europe) to receive patented vending machines from Sielaff&#x27;s Berlin factory. The automat spread to New York City in 1912, and gradually became part of popular culture in northern industrial cities.

Originally, the machines in U.S. automats only accepted nickels. A cashier sat in a change booth in the center of the restaurant, behind a wide marble counter with five to eight rounded depressions. The diner would insert the required number of coins in a machine and then lift a window, hinged at the top, and remove the meal, which was usually wrapped in waxed paper. The kitchen was located behind the machines and used to replenish them from the rear.

Automats were popular with a wide variety of celebrity patrons, including Walter Winchell and Irving Berlin. The New York automats were also popular with unemployed songwriters and actors. Playwright Neil Simon called automats &quot;the Maxim&#x27;s of the disenfranchised&quot; in 1987.

The automat was threatened by the arrival of fast food restaurants, which served food over the counter with more payment flexibility than traditional automats. By the 1970s, the automats&#x27; remaining appeal in their core urban markets was chiefly nostalgic. Another contributing factor to their demise was inflation, which caused an increase in food prices and made the use of coins inconvenient in a time before bill acceptors were common on vending equipment.

At one time, there were 40 Horn &amp; Hardart automats in New York City. The last one closed in 1991, when the company had converted most of its New York City locations into Burger King restaurants. At the time, customers had been noticing a decrease in the quality of the food.

=== 2000s US revivals ===
In an attempt to revive automats, a company called Bamn! opened a Dutch-style automat store in the East Village in New York City in 2006, only to close three years later. In 2015, another attempt to open an automat was made by a San Francisco company called Eatsa, which opened six automated restaurants in California, New York, and the District of Columbia, but they all closed by 2019. The company soon rebranded itself as Brightloom, and continue to sell automation technology to restaurants.

The COVID-19 pandemic inspired a new wave of automat revival attempts, aimed to adapt to the social distancing guidelines and the desire for contactless dining. Joe Scutellaro and Bob Baydale opened Automat Kitchen, which specialized in fresh food, in Jersey City&#x27;s Newport Centre in early 2021; however, it closed after one year of operation because of low foot traffic due to the pandemic. Another automat chain, the Brooklyn Dumpling Shop, opened in the East Village in 2021; they opened a chain in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in December 2023.

== Rail transport ==
A form of the automat was used on some passenger trains. The Great Western Railway in the United Kingdom announced plans in December 1945 to introduce an automat on buffet cars. Plans were delayed by impending nationalisation, but an automat was finally introduced on the &quot;Cambrian Coast Express&quot; in 1962.

In the United States, the Pennsylvania Railroad introduced an automat between New York Penn Station, and Washington Union Station, in 1954. Southern Pacific Railroad introduced automat buffet cars on the &quot;Coast Daylight&quot; and &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; in 1962. Amtrak converted four buffet cars to automats in 1985 for use on the Auto Train. 

In Switzerland, the BodenseeâToggenburg Bahn introduced automat buffet cars in 1987.

With the advent of air travel and other forms of transportation, automats on trains became less popular and were eventually phased out. The last automat in use on a train in the United States was on the short-lived &quot;Lake Country Limited&quot; in 2001.

<doc id="926003" wikidata="Q4883647" url="?curid=926003" title="Belle Isle, Leeds">
<text>Belle Isle is a large suburb south of Leeds city centre, West Yorkshire, England. It is bounded to the north and east by the M621 motorway.

The district lies in the LS10 Leeds postcode area. Belle Isle is part of the Middleton Park ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds South parliamentary constituency.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Belle Isle&quot; is first attested in the Rothwell parish register for 1762 as &quot;Newbell-ile&quot;, and then in 1763 as &quot;Belle Isle&quot;, situated at Middleton Wood End. The name is borrowed from that of the French island Belle Ãle, off the Breton coast, whose name is French for &#x27;beautiful island&#x27;. The island was captured and held by British forces from 1761 to 1763 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and this event inspired the naming of the Yorkshire settlement. There is also speculation that the name might be a pun on the place-name &quot;Bell Hill&quot; (which allegedly derives from the distinctive &quot;bell&quot; shaped early coal mining bell pits of the hilly area).

==History==

In the late eighteenth century, Belle Isle was just a small hamlet for workers at a colliery opposite Middleton Woods, near the current site of Middleton colliery railway.

Belle Isle now consists largely of housing estates built on farming land by the local authority housing department during the clearance of slum dwellings and the expansion of Leeds in the early twentieth-century; some of these homes are now in private ownership.

The estate is divided north to south by Belle Isle Road with the wide expanse of Belle Isle Circus lying at the centre of the estate.

The majority of the homes in Belle Isle are red brick semi-detached houses although this stock has been added to over the years. The majority still belong to Leeds City Council and are managed locally by Belle Isle Tenant Management Organisation (TMO). BITMO is a not for profit housing company that is run by a tenant board.

Some of the council estates of Belle Isle are listed below:
* Petersfield Avenue
* Windmill Road
* The Clearings
* Manor Farms (often debated as to whether this lies in Middleton)
* Newhall Road
* The Brooms
* The Aberfields
* The Lanshaws
* The Nesfields
==Demography==
Like the neighbouring communities of Beeston Hill, Holbeck and Middleton, Belle Isle is considered to be amongst the most deprived areas in the country. Examples of disadvantage found in the district include low educational attainment, low skill levels, and concerns about crime, anti-social behaviour and lack of facilities.

In 2010 the Middleton Park ward which includes Belle Isle had 27487 inhabitants of which 52.2% were female and 47.8% male and 21.5% were aged 15 or under compared with an England average of 18.7%. Life Expectancy for males and females is more than three years less than the rest of Leeds. In 2001, most residents, 96.3%, identified as White British with 71.6% identifying as Christian and over 18% having no religion. Most houses are in the Council Tax Bands A and B. In April 2012, 1493 people were claiming Jobseekers allowance which at 8.3% was nearly double the Leeds&#x27; average. While all recorded crime was below the Leeds&#x27; average, criminal damage was substantially higher and nearly twice the England average.

In the Middleton Park ward in 2001, there were 10,649 households of which 1,201 households with dependent children had and no adult in employment. Of the 1,410 of lone parent households with dependent children, most, 1,307 were women and most had no job. Male lone parents numbered 95 of which 39 were in full-time employment. Nearly half the households, 5,170 had no car or van.

==Education==
Belle Isle has a number of schools. Merlyn Rees Community High School, situated at the heart of Belle Isle, provided educational facilities for over 20 years (previously known as Belle Isle Middle School), but, in late 2006, the school closed down. Merlyn Rees then changed its name to South Leeds High School. It was then demolished and is now situated near South Leeds Sports centre. In 2009 the school was renamed South Leeds Academy.

Other schools in the area are Windmill Primary School (previously known as Belle Isle Primary School) opposite Merlyn Rees School, and Clapgate Primary School on Cranmore Drive. Also, Sharp Lane Primary School is located near the Omnibus Pub. Broomfield SILC - Specialist Inclusive Learning Centre, an all-age generic special school is on the Broom estate.

==Religion==

The churches of St John and St Barnabas (Anglican), West Grange (Evangelical) and St Peter (Roman Catholic) serve the area. The United Reformed Church in South Leeds was built in 2011 on the site of a Congregational Church opened in 1952 on Nesfield Road.

==Entertainment==
It is the site of the popular Belle Isle Working Men&#x27;s Club, which hosted many regional and national stars during the 1970s club boom. The club burnt to the ground in 2000 but was subsequently rebuilt.

==Notable people==
The television presenter and model, Nell McAndrew, is from Belle Isle. The England international rugby league players Garry Schofield, Jason Robinson and Sonny Nickle, Snatch singer Darren Britton and the philosopher Paul Crowther also grew up there and were pupils at Belle Isle Primary School. DJ and rapper Tom Zanetti was born and raised in the area.

==Amenities==
At the heart of the area is a large area of public open land, in the centre of a traffic roundabout, called &quot;Belle Isle Circus&quot;; this was originally the site of a terminus for trams.

The spoil tips surrounding the former colliery are now being converted into woodland, adjacent to the ancient semi-natural woodlands of Middleton Wood.

<doc id="926004" wikidata="Q4595887" url="?curid=926004" title="1 Main Circuit">
<text>1 Main Circuit (1MC) is the term for the shipboard public address circuits on United States Navy and United States Coast Guard vessels. This provides a means of transmitting general information and orders to all internal ship spaces and topside areas, and is loud enough that all embarked personnel are (normally) able to hear it. It is used to put out general information to the ship&#x27;s crew on a regular basis each day. The system consists of an amplifier-oscillator group which is located in the IC/gyro room, a microphone control station, portable microphones at each control station and loudspeakers located throughout the ship. Control stations for the 1MC announcing system are located at the pilot house, OOD stations on the quarterdecks, aft steering and Damage Control Central area.

During an incident involving a casualty, the 1MC is a communication tool used by DCAs (damage control assistants) to keep ship members alerted and informed of casualty location area, status, and incident response efforts by the DC organization.

The 1MC is divided into smaller sub-circuits, such as officer&#x27;s quarters and topside. At the option of the officer of the deck, some details are not passed on certain circuits.

The 1MC is also used for transmitting various alarm sounds to alert the crew of specific impending dangers such as an inbound anti-ship missile, chemical attack, collision, or a flight deck crash.

The smoking lamp is out aft of frame 1-2-niner; all personnel not involved in flight operations stay forward of frame 1-2-niner! All personnel remove soft hats and refrain from throwing FOD material over the side!&quot;
* Testing shipwide alarm systems: &quot;The following is a test of the ship&#x27;s general, chemical, and collision alarms from the bridge --Disregard. [Test alarm sounds] Test complete, regard all further alarms!&quot;

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, a 1995 submarine film, demonstrates in some detail the usage of the 1MC with regard to command instructions and ship-wide orders.
* &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2003): The series shows frequent use of the 1MC general address system aboard &quot;Galactica&quot;, most often to warn of an incoming attack. The most typical format for this warning resembles, &quot;Action Stations! Action Stations! Set Condition One throughout the ship! This is not a drill!&quot;

<text>Audition Records is an e-magazine project born in Berlin in 2010. Audition Records focusing efforts on publishing and promoting artists working on sound improvisation and electroacoustic music.
Audition Records is curated by Julian Bonequi, musician and activist living in Berlin until November 2012. Currently the base of Audition Records is in Berlin. The philosophy of this new proposal aims to open a new space on the netaudio community focused on improvised music and live recordings of events and concerts all around the world. And as a mobile project, collecting concerts and concepts around the strong scene based in Europe. Audition Records is a series of documents centered on different compositional approaches of Free Jazz, Echtzeitmusik, Noise, Electroacoustic and all kind of Experimental and improvised music performances.

== History ==
The project was born on 15 January 2010 in Barcelona, after Audioatalaia published the release &quot;Machinations of Joy&quot; of which Julian Bonequi is former artist. Since that, Edu Comelles (the Coordinator of Audioatalaia, based in Valencia) and Julian Bonequi (project manager and curator of Audition Records) create an exclusive space for the denominated improvised music scene, without matters of the semantic school or the stylistic signature of the musicians.

Audiotalaia Netlabel is a project founded with the aim to release and promote the work from Spanish artists and resident musicians working in Spain. They search for proposals in experimental sound composition, ambient music and electronic music.
Audiotalaia was born from a previous project called Talaies Sonores. This project was based on the idea of dialoguing between sound composition and landscape. According to this, they look after artists working on an electronic media framework but keeping an eye into the natural world, the landscape and the environment.

The first Audition Records, with no connection to the Audition Records based in Berlin, was sold in October 1959 by Enoch Light to ABC-Paramount Records. Audition Records was a record label located in Nashville, Tennessee.

He is the son of the former Portuguese Prime Minister and President, MÃ¡rio Soares, and the actress Maria Barroso. He was married to Maria OlÃ­mpia Soares (b. 1951), daughter of AntÃ³nio Domingos de Oliveira Soares and wife Clotilde Soares, by whom he had three children: Maria InÃªs (b. 1976), Maria Mafalda (b. 1981) and MÃ¡rio Alberto (b. 1987). Later divorced, he married the Belgian Annick Burhenne, by whom he had a son Jonas (b. 2003), named after Jonas Savimbi, of whom JoÃ£o Soares is an admirer, and a daughter Lilah (b. 2007).

He was member of the European Parliament and of the Portuguese State Council.

In 2004, he lost to Manuel Alegre and JosÃ© SÃ³crates a bid for the party leadership, and in October 2005 lost to Fernando Seara the election for President of the Municipality of Sintra. He also lost the election for president of the Municipality of Lisbon to Pedro Santana Lopes, in 2001, being the first mayor of Lisboa to lose a reelection.

In July 2008 he was elected President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. He was reelected for another one-year term in July 2009.

During the 2008 and 2012 United States elections, he acted as the special coordinator for the OSCE International Observation Misson.

In April 2016, in a Facebook post, JoÃ£o Soares, Minister of Culture, said that he looked forward to landing &quot;salutary blows&quot; on two newspaper columnists. The post attracted hundreds of critical comments from the public, opposition politicians and journalists. Mr Soares, resigned after Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa reprimanded him and issued a public apology. He initially defended his comments as a response to an &quot;insulting personal attack&quot;, but later apologised.

<text>In early ayurvedic medicine, rasÄyana (Pali and Sanskrit: à¤°à¤¸à¤¾à¤¯à¤¨, &quot;path of essence&quot;) is one of the eight areas of medicine in Sanskrit literature. 

The 11th-century Persian scholar AbÅ« RayhÄn BÄ«rÅ«nÄ« noted an Indian science named &quot;RasÄyana&quot;, focused on restoring health and rejuvenation through plant-derived medicines. Nagarjunacharya conducted experiments in his laboratory called &quot;Rasashala&quot; and authored &quot;Rasaratanakaram&quot;, detailing alchemical transformations of metals. Al-BÄ«rÅ«nÄ« conflated the earlier rasÄyana practices with rasaÅÄstra alchemy.

RasaÅÄstra utilized alchemical processes involving substances like mercury and cinnabar. This practice extended beyond metals, incorporating the preparation of medical tinctures from plants. RasaÅÄstra&#x27;s goals included longevity, health, cognitive enhancement, virility, and extraordinary abilities. Its historical influence was evident in the Ajanta and Ellora cave paintings, the Vishnustambha monument, and the Kondivade caves&#x27; processed wood sample.

In contemporary times, rasÄyana remains relevant through modern formulations combining herbal wisdom and scientific knowledge, reflecting a continued pursuit of well-being and vitality.

==History==
The more general name for the Indian science of alchemy or proto-chemistry is &quot;RasaÅÄstra (à¤°à¤¸à¤¶à¤¾à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥à¤° in Sanskrit)&quot;, or &quot;The Science of Mercury,&quot; in Nepali, Marathi, Hindi, Kannada and several other languages.

Early Indian alchemical texts discuss the use of prepared forms of mercury or cinnabar (see samskaras). However, there is also ample mention of the preparation of medical tinctures in the early science of Indian alchemy.

Significant progress in alchemy was made in medieval India. An 11th-century Persian chemist and physician named AbÅ« RayhÄn BÄ«rÅ«nÄ« reported 

Two known examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya, was one of the prominent chemists in the history of Indian alchemy. He ran many experiments in his laboratory known as the &quot;Rasashala&quot;. His book, &quot;Rasaratanakaram&quot; is a known example of ancient Indian medicine, in which he describes the procedure of transmuting base metals like mercury, into gold. Due to his contributions and insight in chemistry, he was appointed as chancellor in the university of Nalanda. From the 14th century onwards, many materials from &quot;rasÄyana&quot; and &quot;rasaÅÄstra&quot; were translated and integrated in the Persian texts written by Muslim scholars in South Asia.

==Aim and types==

Rasayana therapy enriches rasa with nutrients to help one attain longevity, memory, intelligence, health, youthfulness, excellence of luster, complexion and voice, optimum development of physique and sense organs, mastery over phonetics, respectability and brilliance.

=== Goals ===
The historical aims of &quot;rasÄyana&quot; were diverse, but the effects attributed to a treatment were typically either longevity, health, intellect, sexuality or magical abilities.

In essence, &quot;rasÄyana&quot; sought to promote aspects of vitality. In pursuit of these matters, herbal prescriptions with many herbal substances, preserved in ghee and honey are given. Specific adaptogenic herbs are also included in rasayanas including haritaki, amla, shilajit, ashwaganda, holy basil, guduchi and shatavari.

==Rasayana formulae==
Puri has given detailed account of classical formulations such as amrit rasayana, brahm rasayana, jawahar mohra, kamdugdha ras, laxami vilas ras, laxman vilas ras, madanoday modak, makrdhawaj vati, manmath ras, mukta panchamrit rasayana, nari kalyan pak, navjeevan ras, navratna ras, navratnakalp amrit, panchamrit ras, paradi ras, ramchuramni ras, rattivalbh pak, shukar amrit vati, smritisagar ras, suvarn malini vasant, suvarn vasant malti, swapanmehtank, vasant kusmakar ras, visha rasaayana, vrihda vangeshwar rasa.

These classical rasayana formulas, contain a large number of ingredients, including minerals, pearl, coral and gems, and include a specially processed mercury (the word R&quot;as&quot; indicates mercury as an ingredient). Because of negative publicity and cost factor, the use of the classical rasayana formulas has declined considerably, and most of the preparations available now have herbal ingredients with a couple of mineral and animal products. The non-availability and wild life protection act has made the use of musk, amber, and parts of wild-life animals nearly impossible.

The current Rasayana formulas are based on such ingredients as amla (&quot;Emblica officinalis&quot;) which, if fresh, has high content of vitamin C, &quot;Terminalia belerica&quot;, &quot;Terminalia chebula&quot;, shilajit, long pepper, black pepper, ginger, processed guggul, guduchi, ashwaganda, shatavari and similar ingredients.

<text>&quot;In the Year 2525 (Exordium &amp; Terminus)&quot; is a 1969 hit song by the American pop-rock duo of Zager and Evans. It reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for six weeks commencing July 12, 1969. It peaked at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in August and September that year. The song was written and composed by Rick Evans in 1964 and released on Truth Records in 1968. It was picked up by RCA Records.

Their follow-up single on RCA Victor, &quot;Mr. Turnkey&quot;, reached No. 48 in the Canadian pop charts and number 41 in the Canadian AC chart. Another single, &quot;Listen to the People&quot;, charted at No. 100 and No. 96 in Canada.

==Summary==
&quot;In the Year 2525&quot; is a song about the journey of mankind over a 10,000-year span. It predicts that man&#x27;s thoughts, relationships and body will be negatively impacted by technological advances and ends with man&#x27;s extinction.

==Recording==
The song was recorded in 1968, at a studio in a cow pasture in Odessa, Texas.

===Personnel===
*Denny Zager &amp; Rick Evansacoustic guitars &amp; vocals
*Mark Daltonbass guitar
*Dave Truppdrums
*The Odessa Symphonyadditional instruments
*Tommy Allsupproducer

The record had regional success so RCA Records picked it up for a national release. RCA producer Ethel Gabriel was tasked with enhancing the sound and arrangement. The track went to number 1 on the U.S. charts within three weeks of release.

==Legacy==
Famously, the song made Zager and Evans the ultimate one-hit wonders; for many years, the Nebraska duo were the only artist to hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic -- and never had another hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s chart nor in Britain. (The Canadian group Magic! went to number one in both the US and the UK with &quot;Rude&quot; in 2014, but have not had a hit record outside of Canada since.) 

The song has been covered at least 60 times in seven languages, including a Jewish parody recorded by Country Yossi, and an Italian cover by Caterina Caselli titled &quot;Nel 2023.&quot; Zager and Evans themselves also recorded an Italian version of the song, instead called &quot;Nell&#x27;Anno 2033&quot;.

Zager and Evans themselves referred to &quot;2525&quot; in one of their later songs, &quot;Yeah 3Â²&quot; (1970): &quot;I&#x27;m gonna call it &quot;In The Year 2525&quot;, or something like that/And if it sells, then I&#x27;ll do well, gonna pay this woman back&quot;.

It was included in a Clear Channel memorandum, distributed by Clear Channel Communications to every radio station owned by the company, which contained 165 songs considered to be &quot;lyrically questionable&quot; following the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Two lines of the song are sung by the inmate Murphy in the 1992 film &quot;Alien 3&quot; immediately prior to his death. 

Brief snippets are played in &quot;The Time Is Now&quot;, the second-season finale of the TV show &quot;Millennium&quot;, which depicts an apocalyptic event. 

The song was rewritten and used as the introductory theme for the 2000 TV series &quot;Cleopatra 2525&quot;. 

In 2010, it was parodied as &quot;In the Year 252525&quot; in the seventh episode of &quot;Futurama&quot;&#x27;s sixth season, &quot;The Late Philip J. Fry&quot;, as Fry, Professor Farnsworth and Bender travel forwards through time to find a period in which the &quot;backwards&quot; time machine has been invented. 

The song acts as an aesthetic theme to the film &quot;Gentlemen Broncos&quot;. 

The BBC Radio series &quot;2525&quot;, a sketch show set in that year, featured a cover of the song with its first lyric as its introductory theme.

The first few verses of the song are used as the opening theme while the credits roll in the 2006 film &quot;Tunnel Rats&quot;.

Zager once said that a &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover from 1969 featured him and Evans with the caption &quot;Even The Beatles would be jealous&quot;. However, no cover of the duo is included in Time&#x27;s magazine history for 1969.

Coincidentally, in the Thai solar calendar, 2525 coincides with 1982 CE.

<doc id="926023" wikidata="Q7961609" url="?curid=926023" title="Waldorf Music Hall Records">
<text>Waldorf Music Hall Records was a budget record label exclusively sold in Woolworth stores from 1954 to 1959. Waldorf was headed by Enoch Light and based in Harrison, New Jersey. Light&#x27;s business partners in this venture were Casper Pinsker and Dick Davemos. The business model for Waldorf Music Hall appears to have been inspired by the popularity of the Your Hit Parade television program. In the 1950s it was common to refer to Waldorf Music Hall, and other labels like it, as &#x27;Hit Parader Records.&#x27;

==History==
Although many sources give 1953 as the establishment date for Waldorf Music Hall, none of their releases appears to predate 1954. Light&#x27;s promotional literature identifies Waldorf Music Hall as the first record label he began on his own, with Light&#x27;s Project 3 label debuting in 1967. Therefore, the Waldorf label was &quot;Project 1&quot; whilst Grand Award Records and its later subsidiary Command Records became &quot;Project 2&quot;. It was begun as a generic, &quot;soundalike&quot; label, with Light&#x27;s stable of artistsâLoren Becker, Artie Malvin, Lois Winter, Dottie Evans and othersâreproducing the hits of the day. Some have regarded Waldorf Music Hall as the first such label, but it appears that Big 4 Hits, a label based out of Cincinnati and headed by Carl Burkhardt, was established in 1952 and is therefore earlier. Emblazoned with the diamond-shaped logo &quot;FDR&quot;âmeaning &quot;Full Dynamic Range,&quot; signifying high fidelity, but also invoking an acronym for a popular American presidentâWaldorf Music Hall was primarily a 10&quot; LP label with 8 hits apiece; 48 releases in the 3300 series appeared between January 1954 and December 1957. Waldorf Music Hall also issued 45 rpm EPs of the same material; 78 rpm releases were issued on a plain label simply called &quot;Waldorf&quot; and on subsidiary labels 18 Top Hits and Rock N Roll. The 10&quot; Lps sold for 99 cents, and the singles for 69 cents apiece.

As mainstream pop vocals in the hit market began to give way to rock n&#x27; roll hits, Hit Parader type versions of these began to sound considerably more quaint and old-fashioned compared to the originals. Fortunately, Waldorf Music Hall had begun to diversify its offerings already through a $1.49 12&quot; album program that featured coherent offerings ranging from classical and opera to children&#x27;s records, jazz, dance music and gospel. In 1955, Light had begun his higher profile Grand Award label and this drew some attention away from Waldorf Music Hall; the Hit Parader issues stopped at the end of 1957. However, at the same time Waldorf gained a budget subsidiary, Colortone Records. In 1959, Enoch Light sold all of his labels to AM-PAR and became part of their organization. Grand Award continued, but at this point Waldorf Music Hall became dormant, having served its short-lived purpose.

==Legacy==

Many collectors view the Waldorf Music Hall records as &quot;junk,&quot; and they are relatively common in second hand shops, though it took one collector more than thirty years to locate copies of all 48 albums in the 10&quot; 3300 series. Nevertheless, some of the 12&quot; albumsâfor example,those by the gospel group Deep River Boys and the traditional jazz band The Royal Playboysâremain desirable and are unique to Waldorf Music Hall. Moreover, the label also issued recordings by pianists Pauline Alpert and Dick Hyman (as &quot;Knuckles O&#x27;Toole&quot; and &quot;Puddin&#x27; Head Smith&quot;), bandleaders Will Bradley, Bobby Byrne and Peanuts Hucko and other significant artists under-utilized or not employed by the major labels. Waldorf Music Hall also released some novelty songs performed by TV comedian/actor Wally Cox. In keeping with Light&#x27;s reputation as an audiophile, Waldorf Music Hall issues do on the whole sound better than average for Hit Parader records, and the performances are of professional caliber even if the idiom of rock &#x27;n roll is not comfortably realized.

<doc id="926024" wikidata="Q7986159" url="?curid=926024" title="West Park, Leeds">
<text>West Park is a suburb of north-west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, north of Headingley. It is a mixed area of private suburban housing and suburban council estates. The name derives from its main park (approximately 500 metres north-south by 300 metres east-west) containing playing fields together with a conservation area of grassy meadow ending in woodland. The largest housing estate in West Park is Moor Grange.

The majority of the area sits in the Weetwood ward of Leeds City Council, except for the south west corner sitting in the neighbouring Kirkstall ward.

==Governance==
The south west corner (with an eastern border of Spen Lane and the A6120 Leeds Outer Ring Road to the north) of West Park lies in the Kirkstall ward and the rest of the suburb sits in the Weetwood ward. As a result, West Park is split between two parliamentary constituencies with the Leeds North West constituency including Weetwood ward (served by Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament, Alex Sobel) and Leeds West constituency (represented by fellow Labour MP Rachel Reeves) covering Kirkstall ward.

It has the postcode of LS16.

==Geography==
The West Park district is approximately four miles north west of Leeds city centre. Its boundaries are approximately the A660 Otley Road to the east, the A6120 Leeds Outer Ring Road to the North, the Harrogate Line railway to the West, and the Queenswood Drive / Spen Lane intersection to the South.

==Amenities==
The amenities of West Park lie in two main areas, on Otley Road there are several shops, a post office, a laundrette, a specialist runners shop, an estate agency, Indian and Italian restaurants. There is also a nursery for children aged up to 5 years. The main parade of shops on Otley Road has Dutch fronts. There are amenities on the Moor Grange estate around Spen Lane and Butcher Hill, which include: Abbey Grange Church of England High School, St Chad&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, St Andrew&#x27;s church which also houses the offices of STEP (Supporting The Elderly People), a doctor&#x27;s surgery, a post office, a beautician, hair salons, cafÃ©s, a Co-op supermarket, newsagents, takeaways, a pet shop, a charity shop, a window and glazing store, a florist, a launderette, and a public house called &#x27;The Dalesman&#x27;. Lawnswood School lies in between West Park and Lawnswood. West Park lies close to Headingley and Horsforth which have larger local centres. The West Park Centre (an educational facility in the premises of the former West Park High School) was demolished in 2014 after the building was declared unsafe and deemed too expensive to repair.

==Transport==
West Park is between the A660 and the A65, with the Leeds Outer Ring Road running to the north of the area. The Leeds-Harrogate railway line runs through Moor Grange, but there is no station, the nearest to the south is Headingley and Horsforth to the north. Many bus routes run through the area, providing regular services to Leeds city centre, Headingley and Horsforth.

==Housing==

West Park has an area of early 20th century private housing between Otley Road and Spen Lane, mainly large detached and semi detached houses. The streets here are mainly tree-lined and have wide pavements. There are also some older Victorian buildings around Otley Road, some of which have been divided into flats. The houses towards Otley Road are generally older and larger than those towards Spen Lane. The private housing generally lies to the East of West Park, where it gives way to Far Headingley to the South and Lawnswood to the North. Most of the private housing in West Park lie in a Conservation area.

Moor Grange Estate is a 1950s-built council estate, on reclaimed farm land called &#x27;Old Farm&#x27;, together with a more affluent estate of predominantly large semi and detached housing between Spen Lane and the A660 Otley Road. The smaller Spen Estate is south of Butcher Hill. The Moor Grange area was used for filming &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot;, using the Butcher Hill playing fields and the Clayton Grange flats. The crime rate in and around the Moor Grange and Spen Estates is generally lower than other council estates and house prices are similar to other North Leeds suburbs such as Roundhay, Oakwood, Adel, and Horsforth.

<doc id="926027" wikidata="Q239935" url="?curid=926027" title="City of Arts and Sciences">
<text>The City of Arts and Sciences (, ) is a cultural and architectural complex in the city of Valencia, Spain. It is the most important modern tourist destination in the city of Valencia and one of the 12 Treasures of Spain.

The City of Arts and Sciences is situated at the southeast end of the former riverbed of the river Turia, which was drained and rerouted after a catastrophic flood in 1957. The old riverbed was turned into a picturesque sunken park.

Designed by Santiago Calatrava and FÃ©lix Candela, the project began the first stages of construction in July 1996, and was inaugurated on 16 April 1998 with the opening of L&#x27;HemisfÃ¨ric. The last major component of the City of Arts and Sciences, Palau de les Arts Reina SofÃ­a, was inaugurated on 9 October 2005, Valencian Community Day. The most recent building in the complex, L&#x27;Ãgora, was opened in 2009.

Originally budgeted at â¬300 million in 1991 for three structures, it has expanded about three times the initial expected cost.

== Buildings and structures ==
The complex is made up of the following buildings and structures, presented in the order of their inauguration:

*L&#x27;HemisfÃ¨ric (1998) â an IMAX Cinema, planetarium and laserium. The building is meant to resemble a giant eye, and has an approximate surface of . The HemisfÃ¨ric, also known as the planetarium or the &quot;eye of knowledge&quot;, is the centerpiece of the City of Arts and Sciences. It was the first building completed in 1998. Its design resembles an eyelid that opens to access the surrounding water pool. The bottom of the pool is glass, creating the illusion of the eye as a whole. This planetarium is a half-sphere in a concrete structure long and wide. The shutter is built of elongated aluminum awnings that fold upward collectively to form a brise soleil roof that opens along the curved axis of the eye. It opens to reveal the dome, the &quot;iris&quot; of the eye, which is the planetarium or Ominax theater. The structure is divided in half by a set of stairs that descend into the vaulted concrete lobby. The underground spaces are illuminated with the use of translucent glass panels within the walking path. The transparent roof is supported by concrete arches that connect to the sunken gallery. There is a remarkable echo in the building and if two people stand at the two opposite pillars inside of the eye they can speak with each other.
*Museu de les CiÃ¨ncies PrÃ­ncipe Felipe (2000) â an interactive museum of science that resembles the skeleton of a whale. It occupies around on three floors. Much of the ground floor is taken up by a basketball court sponsored by a local team and various companies. The building has three floors, of which is used for exhibitions. The first floor has a view of the Turia Garden that surrounds it, which is over 13,500 square meters of water. The second floor hosts &quot;The Legacy of Science&quot; exhibition by researchers Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal and Severo Ochoa y Jean Dausset. The third floor is known as the &quot;Chromosome Forest&quot; and shows the sequencing of human DNA. Also on this floor are the &quot;Zero Gravity,&quot; &quot;Space Academy&quot; and &quot;Marvel Superheroes&quot; exhibitions. The building&#x27;s architecture is known for its geometry, structure, use of materials, and its design around nature. The building is about , of which is exhibition space, making it the largest in Spain. It has of glass, 4,000 panes, of concrete, and 14,000 tons of steel. The building stands long, wide and high.
*L&#x27;Umbracle (2001) â an open structure enveloping a landscaped walk with plant species indigenous to Valencia (such as rockrose, lentisca, rosemary, lavender, honeysuckle, bougainvillea and palm trees). It harbors in its interior The Walk of the Sculptures, an outdoor art gallery with sculptures by contemporary artists (Miquel of Navarre, Francesc Abbot, Yoko Ono and others). The &quot;Umbracle&quot; is also home to numerous free-standing sculptures surrounded by nature. It was designed as an entrance to the City of Arts and Sciences. It is long and wide, located on the southern side of the complex. It includes 55 fixed arches and 54 floating arches that stand high. The plants displayed were carefully picked to change colour with each season. The garden includes 99 palm trees, 78 small palm trees, and 62 bitter orange trees. There are 42 varieties of shrubs from the Region of Valencia including cistuses, mastics, buddleia, pampas grass, and plumbagos. In the garden there are 16 species of &quot;Mirabilis jalapa&quot;, or the four-o&#x27;clock flower (&quot;beauty of the night&quot;). Honeysuckle and hanging bougainvillea are two of the 450 climbing plants in &quot;L&#x27;Umbracle&quot;. There also are 5,500 ground cover plants such as lotus, agatea, Spanish flags, and fig-marigolds. There are over a hundred aromatic plants including rosemary and lavender.
*L&#x27;OceanogrÃ fic (2003) â an open-air oceanographic park. It is the largest oceanographic aquarium in Europe with and of water. It was built in the shape of a water lily and is the work of architect FÃ©lix Candela. Each building represents different aquatic environments including the Mediterranean, wetlands, temperate and tropical seas, the Antarctic, the Arctic, islands and the Red Sea. This aquarium is a home to over 500 different species including dolphins, belugas, sawfish, jellyfish, starfish, sea urchins, walruses, sea lions, seals, penguins, turtles, sharks and rays. It also houses wetland bird species.
*Palau de les Arts Reina SofÃ­a (2005) â an opera house and performing arts center dedicated to music and the performing arts. It is surrounded by of landscape and water, as well as of walking area. The Palau de Les Arts has four sections: the main hall, the master hall, the auditorium, and the Martin y Soler theatre. It holds many events such as opera, theatre and music in its auditoriums. Panoramic lifts and stairways connect platforms at different heights on the inside of the metallic frames of the building. The building has a metallic feather outer roof that is 230 meters long and 70 meters high. The building is supported by white concrete. Two laminated steel shells cover the building, weighing over 3,000 tons. These shells are 163 meters wide and 163 meters long.
*Montolivet Bridge (2007) - concrete road bridge crossing the dry Turia riverbed that consists of an older straight-roadway northern segment with column piers designed by FernÃ¡ndez OrdÃ³Ã±ez (1933â2000) connected with a newer curved-roadway southern segment with white arch point supports designed by Santiago Calatrava, located in between, and complementing his design of, &quot;Palua de les Arts Reina SofÃ­a&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Hemisferic&quot;.
*Assut de l&#x27;Or Bridge (2008) â a white cable-stayed bridge sustained by a curved pylon with backstayed counterweights, crossing the dry Turia riverbed, connecting the south side with Minorca Street, in between &quot;El Museu de les CiÃ¨ncies&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Agora&quot;. The pylon of the bridge, at high, is the highest point in the city.
* L&#x27;Ãgora (2009) â a covered plaza in which concerts and sporting events (such as the Valencia Open 500) are held. The Agora is a space designed to hold a variety of events such as concerts, performances, exhibitions, conventions, staging of congresses, and international sports meetings. Many important events have been held in this building, including the Freestyle Burn Spanish Cup in 2010 and the Christmas Special Program.
* Valencia Towers â part of a Calatrava project (2005) to complete the City of Arts and Sciences with the additional construction, then estimated to take more than two decades to complete, of three sculptural towers of 308, 266 and 220 m tall, which symbolize the cities of Valencia, Alicante and CastellÃ³n, respectively. The proposed project has been put on hold.

== History ==

=== Origins of the project ===
In 1989, the president of the Valencian Autonomous Government, Joan Lerma, after a visit to the new CitÃ© des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie in Paris, and through the general director of planning and studies of the Presidency of the Generalitat Valenciana, JosÃ© MarÃ­a BernabÃ©, officially commissioned the scientist Antonio Ten Ros to draft a first proposal for a City of Science and Technology for Valencia.

Ten Ros drew up a first draft, entitled &quot;Vilanova, A City of Science for Valencia&quot;, which was officially presented to the Generalitat in May 1989. After that, he was formally commissioned in 1990 to direct the creation of a general draft amounting to 92,650,000 pesetas (556,000 euros), to be managed by the University of Valencia. Antonio Ten Ros assembled a team of 56 scientists, museologists and designers including Professor JosÃ© MarÃ­a LÃ³pez PiÃ±ero as responsible for the space &quot;A walk through history&quot;. Ten Ros presented the draft in 32 volumes to President Lerma in the Palace of the Generalitat on 21 December 1991.

The &quot;City of Science and Communications&quot; was the name that the autonomous government gave to the initiative, and plans included a 370 m high communications tower, which would have been the third highest one in the world at that time; a planetarium; and a museum of science. The total price of the works was estimated to be about 25,000 million pesetas.

In May 1991, the council approved the transfer of lands. Four months later the project plan with three structures (communications tower, planetarium, and a science museum) was presented, designed by Santiago Calatrava.

The team that had designed the museum did not see eye to eye with the form in which Santiago Calatrava conceived the building, and a couple of changes were made. Preliminary site work began by the end of 1994.

The project was not without controversy. The Conservative Popular Party saw in the City of Science a &quot;work of the pharaohs&quot; that would serve only to swell the ego of the Socialists, who were the driving forces behind the initiative.

=== Expanded plan and construction ===

In 1995, the Popular Party won against the Socialists. However, several successive Popular Party governments continued and expanded the complex far beyond the original Socialist project at an enormous cost, heavily indebting the city.

After a change of government in 1996, the planned telecommunication tower was cancelled and replaced by an opera house, which was more expensive, and architect FÃ©lix Candela was added to design an oceanographic park, all of which led to underspecified increases in the project budget and to updating the name to &quot;City of Arts and Sciences&quot;. In July 1996, the original &quot;Valencia, Ciencia y Comunicaciones&quot; was officially changed to &quot;Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias, S.A.&quot; (CACSA). Construction on the City of Arts and Sciences under CACSA began July 1996. When construction started in 1997 on the Palau de les Arts, it was built with the same foundation and the same contract that had been planned for the cancelled communications tower.

The revised plan (by Calatrava) exhibited a strong longitudinal axis that defined the backbone tying together all the structures of the complex. It bisected the Opera House, Montolivet Bridge, L&#x27;Hemisferic, and extended through the Assut de L&#x27;Or Bridge and L&#x27;Agora (commissioned later in 2005) to L&#x27;Oceanografic (designed by Candela). Parallel to the axis were placed the science museum, L&#x27;Umbracle, raised promenades and reflecting pools.

Another unifying element was the use of the cityâs traditional heritage, viz., the use of ceramic mosaic tiles known as &quot;âtrencadisâ&quot;, which was widely used as the exterior layer over the concrete surfaces of many of the buildings/structures and elements of the promenade throughout the complex.

Construction continued on the site until the last structure, L&#x27;Agora, was completed in 2009. The total cost of the project came in at 1,200 million euros.

=== Inauguration ===
In April 1998, the complex opened its doors to the public with L&#x27;HemisfÃ¨ric. Eleven months later, the President of Valencia, Eduardo Zaplana, inaugurated the Museu de les CiÃ¨ncies PrÃ­ncipe Felipe, although the museum was not yet finished. The museum was opened to the public twenty months later. On 12 December 2002 was the opening of L&#x27;OceanogrÃ fic, the largest aquarium built in Europe. Queen SofÃ­a, on 8 October 2005, inaugurated the Palau de les Arts Reina SofÃ­a, which became the opera house of Valencia.

=== Architects: Santiago Calatrava and FÃ©lix Candela ===

Santiago Calatrava was born in Valencia, Spain, on 28 July 1951. He is an architect and engineer also known for his skills in painting and sculpting. He attended the Art Academy in Valencia in the mid-1960s; then he earned a degree in architecture and a postgraduate course in city planning at the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Arquitectura, studied civil engineering at the Federal Polytechnic University of Zurich, and participated in academic research investigating the foldability of space frames.

Calatrava&#x27;s architecture aims to unite structure and movement. Early in his career, Calatrava designed Stadelhofen Station in Zurich. He was recognized for his achievement in creating poetics of movement and integrating public transportation in a natural setting and urban context. Another theme in his work was moving contraptions in his buildings; for example, his dome for the Reichstag Conversion Competition in Berlin opens and closes like a flower, and the Planetarium in the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia opens and closes like eyelids.

FÃ©lix Candela was born on 27 January 1910 in Madrid, Spain, and died on 7 December 1997. His architectural designs are composed of reinforced concrete structures distinguished by thin, curved shells. His popularity sprung from his design, in collaboration with Jorge Gonzales Reyna, of the Cosmic Rays Pavilion (1951) in Mexico. He used his signature design of the reinforced concrete roof that varies in thickness from only 5/8Â inch to 2Â inches. He also built the church of La Virgin Milagrosa in Mexico City and the church of San Vicente de Paul. His designs consisted of warped-shell industrial buildings, thin-shell centenary, and barrel-vaulted factories and warehouses. Candela was also a teacher at Harvard University and the University of Illinois. Felix Candela designed the underwater city L&#x27;OceanogrÃ fic in the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, reminiscent of Antoni GaudÃ­&#x27;s work in Barcelona.

=== In popular culture ===
Parts of the musical number &quot;Style&quot; from the 2007 Indian film &quot;Sivaji&quot; were shot at the City of Arts and Sciences. Portions of the area were featured in the 2013 racing game &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot; as a photo location. Exterior scenes of the futuristic city in the 2015 film &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; were filmed around the complex.

In 2016 (broadcast in 2017) it was used as a filming location for the British science-fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, appearing in the second episode of the tenth series, &quot;Smile&quot;. The location was used as the headquarters of the company DELOS in the third season of the HBO series &quot;Westworld&quot;. In 2023, it has been used for a location for the 2nd season of the show &quot;Star Wars Andor&quot;.

Various exterior shots of the complex were used to depict a conceptual 2039 New York World&#x27;s Fair for the season finale of &quot;&quot; on National Geographic. Architectural elements from the site were used as a green screen backdrop for the futuristic 2720 city in the 2020 film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music&quot; It&#x27;s also used as the set of the 2020 television adaptation of &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Parts of the shooting for the 2021 TV series &quot;Intergalactic&quot; is also done in the City of Arts and Sciences.

In 2024, MiSaMo, a sub-unit of K-pop girl group Twice, filmed parts of the at the City of Arts and Science.

== Economic impact ==

In 2019 it was reported that the economic impact of the complex is â¬113 million a year and generates 3509 jobs.

<doc id="926035" wikidata="Q266591" url="?curid=926035" title="Salome Alexandra">
<text>Salome Alexandra, or Shlomtzion (; , &quot;Å ÉlÅmá¹£Ä«yyÅn&quot;, &quot;peace of Zion&quot;; 141â67 BC), was a regnant queen of Judaea, one of only three women in Jewish historical tradition to rule over the country, the other two being Deborah and Athaliah. The wife of Aristobulus I, and afterward of Alexander Jannaeus, she was also the last ruler of Judaea to die as the sovereign of an independent kingdom. Her nine-year reign has been described as a &quot;golden age&quot; of Hasmonean history.

== Name ==
Josephus does not use the Hebrew name of Shlomzion (Salome), referring only to her Greek name, &quot;Alexandra&quot; (á¼Î»ÎµÎ¾Î¬Î½Î´ÏÎ±). This is the only known Greek name among Hasmonean women. Salome&#x27;s granddaughters also bore this name. Rabbinic literature, however, never uses the name Alexandra for her, instead referring to her with various Semitic names. The Dead Sea Scrolls have identified Alexandra as &quot;Shlomzion&quot; (×©×××¦×××) in several texts, including 4Q331 and 4Q332.

==Family==

Salome Alexandra&#x27;s personal genealogy is not given by Josephus, nor does it appear in any of the Books of the Maccabees. Rabbinical sources designate the rabbi Simeon ben Shetach as her brother, making her the daughter of Shetah as well. Salome Alexandra&#x27;s oldest son by Alexander Jannaeus was Hyrcanus II who fought his younger brother Aristobulus II in 73 BC over the Jewish High Priesthood. Hyrcanus II was eventually successful after enlisting the help of the Nabataean king, Aretas III; bribing Roman officials, including Scaurus; and gaining the favour of Pompey, who defeated his brother and took him away to Rome.

==Consort==
According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, Salome Alexandra was instrumental in arranging the assassination of her brother-in-law, Antigonus, by convincing her husband that his brother was plotting against him. Upon the death of Aristobulus in 103 BC, Aristobulus&#x27; widow freed his half-brother, Alexander Jannaeus, who had been held in prison.

During the reign of Alexander, who (according to the historian Josephus) apparently married her shortly after his accession, Alexandra seemed to have wielded only slight political influence, as evidenced by the hostile attitude of the king to the Pharisees.

Josephus does not explicitly state Alexandra held any political authority before her reign. However, a passage about the Herodian dynasty in Antiquities, where Josephus describes Antipas, the grandfather of Herod the Great, gaining political power when &quot;King Alexander and his wife (= Alexandra) made him general of all Idumaea&quot;, suggests that Alexandra had some sort of power in Judaea even before she inherited the kingdom.
Jewisharchive.org has her as queen for 40 years and she was their 40 years of blessing. Shlomzion means peace to Zion/peace of Zion.

The frequent visits to the palace of the chief of the Pharisaic party, Simeon ben Shetach, who was said to be the queen&#x27;s brother, must have occurred in the early years of Alexander&#x27;s reign, before Alexander had openly broken with the Pharisees. Alexandra does not seem to have been able to prevent the persecution of that sect by her husband.

According to archaeologist Kenneth Atkinson, &quot;There are also some passages in the Talmud that say, during her husband&#x27;s reign, that she protected Pharisees and hid Pharisees from his wrath.&quot; Nevertheless, the married life of the royal pair seems to have ended cordially; on his deathbed Alexander entrusted the government, not to his sons, but to his wife, with the advice to make peace with the Pharisees.

Salome Alexandra&#x27;s next concern was to open negotiations with the leaders of the Pharisees, whose places of concealment she knew. Having been given assurances as to her future policy, they declared themselves ready to give Alexander&#x27;s remains the obsequies due to a monarch. By this step she avoided any public affront to the dead king, which, owing to the embitterment of the people, would certainly have found expression at the interment. This might have been attended with dangerous results for the Hasmonean dynasty.

== Sole reign ==
Salome Alexandra received the reins of government (76 or 75 BC) at Jannaeus&#x27; camp before Ragaba, and concealed the king&#x27;s death until the fortress had fallen, in order that the rigour of the siege might be maintained. She succeeded for a time in quietening the vexatious internal dissensions of the kingdom that existed at the time of Alexander&#x27;s death; and she did this peacefully and without detriment to the political relations of the Jewish state to the outside world. Alexandra managed to secure assent to a Hasmonean monarchy from the Pharisees, who had suffered under Alexander.

=== Re-establishment of the Sanhedrin ===
The Pharisees now became not only a tolerated section of the community, but actually the ruling class. Salome Alexandra installed as high priest her eldest son, Hyrcanus II, a man who was wholly supportive of the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin was reorganized according to their wishes and became a supreme court for the administration of justice and religious matters, the guidance of which was placed in the hands of the Pharisees.

=== Internal and external policy ===
The Sadducees were moved to petition the queen for protection against the ruling party. Salome Alexandra, who desired to avoid all party conflict, removed the Sadducees from Jerusalem, assigning certain fortified towns for their residence.

Salome Alexandra increased the size of the army and carefully provisioned the numerous fortified places so that neighbouring monarchs were duly impressed by the number of protected towns and castles which bordered the Judean frontier. As well, she did not abstain from actual warfare; she sent her son Aristobulus with an army to besiege Damascus, then beleaguered by Ptolemy Mennaeus. The expedition reportedly achieved little.

The last days of Salome Alexandra&#x27;s reign were tumultuous. Her son, Aristobulus, endeavoured to seize the government, and succeeded her after her death.

=== Prosperity ===
Rabbinical sources refer in glowing terms to the prosperity which Judea enjoyed under Salome Alexandra. The Talmud (Ta&#x27;anit, 23a; Sifra, á¸¤uá¸²á¸²at, i. 110) relates that during her rule, as a reward for her piety, rain fell only on Sabbath (Friday) nights; so that the working class suffered no loss of pay through the rain falling during their work-time. The fertility of the soil was so great that the grains of wheat grew as large as kidney beans; oats as large as olives; and lentils as large as gold denarii. The sages collected specimens of these grains and preserved them to show future generations the rewards of obedience to the Law, and what piety could achieve.

==Legacy==

&quot;Shlomtzion&quot; () is sometimes used as a female first name in contemporary Israel. Among others, the well-known Israeli writer Amos Kenan gave the name to his daughter.

During the British Mandate of Palestine, a major street in Jerusalem was called Princess Mary Street, after the only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary. After the creation of Israel, the street was renamed &quot;Queen Shlomzion Street,&quot; to commemorate the Jewish queen. Such street names exist also in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan.

In the 1977 Knesset elections Ariel Sharon accepted the advice of Kenan to name his new political party &quot;Shlomtzion&quot; (it later merged with the Likud).

Israeli zoologists carefully observing the leopards of the Judean Desert bestowed the name &quot;Shlomtzion&quot; on a female leopard whose life, mating, and offspring were the subject of intensive, years-long study. In 1996, her body was found in Tze&#x27;elim Stream, having died of old age.

==In medieval sources==
According to some versions of the &quot;Toledoth Yeshu&quot;, a medieval alternative-Christian life of Jesus, Salome is connected with Jesus of Nazareth, placing the death of Jesus 150 years earlier.

<text>Burmantofts is an area of 1960s high-rise housing blocks in inner-city east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England adjacent to the city centre and St. James&#x27;s Hospital. It is a racially diverse area, with sizable Afro-Caribbean and Irish communities, but suffers the social problems typical of similar areas across the country.

From 1859 to 1957 Burmantofts was the home of Burmantofts Pottery, a manufacturer of ceramic pipes and construction materials.

In the early 20th century, Burmantofts was a large centre of the textile industry. A Burtons textile factory was located in the area; it is still owned by Burtons, but today is being used as a storage facility.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Burmantofts&quot; is first attested, as &quot;le Burmantoftes&quot;, in 1427. It seems to have been coined in the Middle English period, from the words &quot;burghman&quot; (&#x27;burgher, town-dweller, burgess&#x27;, from &quot;burgh&quot; &#x27;town&#x27; and &quot;man&quot; &#x27;person&#x27;) and &quot;toft&quot; (&#x27;plot of land&#x27;. The name refers to the half-acre parcels of land (or tofts) given to owners of building plots (or burgages) by the River Aire, thus Burgage Men&#x27;s Tofts.

==History==
The burghers from whom Burmantofts takes its name pursued craft businesses in the town, and grew crops on their tofts, such as grain which would be processed at the nearby mill on what is now Miles Hill.

It was on the edge of the Yorkshire coalfield and coal mines and clay extraction led to works making bricks and earthenware. Notably in 1842 Lassey and Wilcock acquired 100 acres north of Nippet Lane, and found they were able to extract both coal and clay from the same mine and became coal sellers and brickmakers. In 1870 this became Wilcock and Co also selling drainage pipes, though this only occupied 4 acres, the rest being farmland. Further development of the site and of newer products led to Burmantofts Pottery, which was made there until 1957.

In 1878, Burmantofts was the site of Leeds&#x27; first municipal waste incinerator, making use of a former industrial chimney.
The area was also home to some textile industry and in 1921, Montague Burton began to develop a site on Hudson Road which eventually became the biggest clothing factory in the world.

After the Second World War Burmantofts was in a very poor condition, however redevelopment did not occur for sometime. While the area was dilapidated and buildings such as the Pineapple Hotel (no 77 Accommodation Road) stood derelict for many years throughout the 1930s and 1940s, no real redevelopment started until the mid-1950s, most of this however was just demolition and in this time only a handful of houses were built around Torre Road and Lupton Avenue. In 1960 the site of Burmantofts Pottery was acquired by the Leeds Corporation and used for housing and the Shakespeare school.

===St Agnes&#x27; parish church===
The only historic building in the area is St Agnes&#x27; United Church, the Church of England parish church on Stoney Rock Lane. It is a Gothic Revival building with stone walls and slate roof, designed by Leeds architects John Kelly and Edward Birchall. The foundation stone was laid on 9 July 1887 and the completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Ripon on 20 May 1889. It was made the parish church in the 1930s when the church of St Stephen (built 1851) was demolished. The west window stained glass in St Agnes&#x27; was originally in St Stephen&#x27;s. The church has a reredos of Burmantofts faience and is a Grade II listed building.

===Housing===
There was relatively little housing in Burmantofts until the 20th century: just a few low-rent houses built amongst the mills. Most of the workers in Burmantofts would have lived in nearby areas such as Harehills, however redevelopment through the 1950s and 1960s brought high density living to Burmantofts and it is this redevelopment that has shaped modern Burmantofts.

By the 1960s, neighbouring Lincoln Green was seeing many new high rise council flats being erected, however it did not take long for Burmantofts to catch up and by the mid-1960s most of the blocks that stand today had been completed. Burmantofts as it is known today was completed around the early 1970s, since then changes in the area have been few and far between.

Burmantofts has changed very little in the last forty years, the only area of change is a St James&#x27; Hospital, which separated Harehills and Burmantofts. St Bridgets Roman Catholic Secondary Modern School on Torre Road closed down in the 1980s and is now St. Patrick&#x27;s Primary School, while the transport depot opposite is now the site of Benfield Ford. In September 2006, the area&#x27;s main secondary school, Primrose High School moved into new premises. With regards to housing, Leeds City Council has not proposed any regeneration in the area, and in recent years is focusing on areas of early-20th century back-to-back housing such as Beeston and Holbeck. There has however been refurbishment of a number of blocks.

At present the majority of the housing in Burmantofts is mid-20th century council-owned housing, mostly made up by multi-story blocks of flats of various heights. A small number of 19th century houses remain close to the Burtons warehouse.

==Population==

Burmantofts has a sizeable Afro Caribbean community. The age range of Burmantofts residents is quite varied, with probably the two largest age groups being young adults and the elderly. Burmantofts has a high unemployment rate, which is one of the contributing factors to its low house prices.

==Politics==
Burmantofts falls into the Burmantofts &amp; Richmond Hill ward of Leeds City Council, currently represented by three Labour ward councillors. The ward sits within the Leeds Central parliamentary constituency, for whom Hilary Benn has been the Member of Parliament since the 1999 Leeds Central by-election.

The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 24,843.

==Transport==
Burmantofts is situated adjacent to the A64 road. It has regular bus routes to the city centre and to other parts of the city, in particular East Leeds. The proposed Leeds Supertram Eastern line was supposed to run in-between Burmantofts and Harehills, however the future of this scheme is uncertain. Other projects have been considered using this route including the Leeds Trolleybus. There is no railway station in Burmantofts, the nearest being Leeds and Cross Gates.

==Facilities==

Burmantofts has fairly limited facilities. Neighbouring Lincoln Green has a small shopping precinct with a Freshways, Costcutter, Cash Converters and other shops, this is walking distance for most of Burmantofts. Burmantofts itself has Ebor Garden&#x27;s Primary and St Peter&#x27;s Primary, the Anglers Club on Nippet Lane, The Sportsman&#x27; public house on Stoney Rock Lane and The New Torre on Torre Road. A Heron Foods store opened in 2017 on Lincoln Green Road. Burmantofts is in most parts less than a mile from the Eastern fringes of Leeds city centre providing it with many other amenities close by. Burmantofts amateur boxing club are based in parts of the former Burtons factory, on the corner of Hudson Road and Stoney Rock Lane.

==Education==
Burmantofts has two secondary schools, Trinity Academy Leeds and Co-op Academy Leeds and Shakespeare Primary School which is on the same site.

==People==
*Elizabeth Dawn, actress best known for her portrayal of Vera Duckworth in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was born and raised in the area.
*Nicola Virginia Adams, the first woman to win an Olympic boxing gold medal, was raised in the area.
*Jabez Tunnicliff, founder of the Band of Hope temperance society, was buried at Burmantofts Cemetery on Sunday 18 June 1865, with a reported attendance of 15,000.

<text>Apt Records was a sub-label from ABC-Paramount Records. The label was started in 1958 and released only singles until it was shelved in 1966. ABC briefly reactivated Apt twice, in 1969 and 1972, and also used the Apt name on a line of budget-priced 8-track and cassette tapes in 1970. The name was derived from ABC-Paramount&#x27;s parent company, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres.

<doc id="926054" wikidata="Q6778919" url="?curid=926054" title="Mary Ann Summers">
<text>Mary Ann Summers is a fictional character in the television sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; which ran on the CBS network from 1964 to 1967, and has run more or less continuously since in reruns. She was played by actress Dawn Wells.

== Character summary ==
Mary Ann was portrayed by actress Dawn Wells. She is an ingÃ©nue, the typical girl next door, and a foil as well as a friend to glamorous Hollywood star Ginger Grant, played by Tina Louise. In addition, her practical domestic skills and plain, good, common sense make her an indispensable member of the group. She is from Winfield, Kansas, a farm girl, and a reference to Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (occasionally wearing Dorothy&#x27;s ubiquitous pigtails and a gingham dress).

Mary Ann is in her late teens to early twenties. She was traveling alone on the &quot;three-hour tour&quot;, which she had won in a contest. She tells the others that she has a boyfriend named Horace Higgenbotham from Horner&#x27;s Corners, Kansas, so they would think she has someone special waiting for her, but confesses later that he is &quot;a real creep&quot; and not her boyfriend at all. In &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, she is revealed to be in fact engaged and that her fiancÃ© had waited 15 years for her, but when she was finally rescued, they no longer loved each other, and he married her best friend instead.

Mary Ann mentions her mother and father in passing and only very briefly, such as when she tells about her father going bankrupt, before the shipwreck, due to a dishonest business partner, but references her Aunt Martha and Uncle George multiple times, leading some to believe that she lived with them and that her parents may be deceased, another connection to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. However, her parents seem to be alive in &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

In &quot;Two on a Raft&quot;, the Honolulu-based AM radio newsreader only states, &quot;the attractive brunette&quot; is &quot;employed at the Winfield General Store&quot;.

Mary Ann Summers was not in the original pilot. They had Bunny, a secretary who was a cheerful but not so bright blonde, played by Nancy McCarthy. Bunny was a co-worker of Ginger Grant, a brunette played by Kit Smythe. After the pilot, both secretary characters were changed. Bunny was replaced by Mary Ann from Kansas, played by Dawn Wells. Ginger was changed from a secretary to a movie star from Hollywood, played by Tina Louise.

<doc id="926106" wikidata="Q1056753" url="?curid=926106" title="Cesare Battisti (militant)">
<text>Cesare Battisti (born 18 December 1954) is an Italian former member of the terrorist group Armed Proletarians for Communism (PAC), who is currently imprisoned after years on the run. PAC was a far-left militant group active in Italy in the late 1970s during the period known as the &quot;Years of Lead&quot;. Battisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in Italy for four homicides (two policemen, a jeweller and a butcher). He fled first to France in 1981, where he received protection under the Mitterrand doctrine. 

Battisti was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; and sentenced to 12 years for being a member of an armed group and for the material killing of two people and instigating another two homicides, based on testimony from Pietro Mutti. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1995. After the &quot;de facto&quot; repeal of the Mitterrand doctrine in 2002, Battisti fled to Brazil under a false identity to avoid a possible extradition, where he lived as a free man until an order of extradition issued in December 2018. He then fled to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, where he was arrested in 2019 by an Italian team of Interpol officers and extradited to Italy. 

He is also a fiction author, having written 15 novels.

== Youth and PAC membership ==
Cesare Battisti was born in 1954 at Cisterna di Latina, near Latina. He left the classical lyceum he was attending in 1971, engaged in petty crime, and then moved on to more serious offenses. In 1976, he moved to Milan, and took part in the activities of the Armed Proletarians for Communism (PAC), an autonomist Marxist group which conducted armed struggle, and which had a &quot;horizontal&quot;, decentralized structure, opposed to the centralist organization of the Red Brigades (BR). The organization, which counted approximately 60 members, had its roots in Barona, a district in the south of Milan.

Four assassinations were committed by the PAC: Antonio Santoro, a prison guard accused by the PAC of mistreatment of prisoners (on 6 June 1978 in Udine); jeweler Pierluigi Torregiani, who had shot and killed a robber in an act of self-defense (on 16 February 1979 in Milan); Lino Sabbadin, a butcher and member of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (on the same date, near Mestre); and DIGOS agent Andrea Campagna, who had participated in the first arrests in the Torregiani case (on 19 April 1979 in Milan). The PAC also engaged in several robberies.

The murder of Torregiani and Sabbadin had been decided upon by the PAC because both of them had previously killed left-wing militants. Torregiani was killed in revenge in front of his 13-year-old son, who was also accidentally shot by his father. The son was left paraplegic and considers Battisti to be responsible for the shooting. &quot;It&#x27;s not about the person of Cesare Battisti,&quot; he declared to the national press agency ANSA, &quot;It&#x27;s in order that everyone understands that, sooner or later, those who have committed such serious crimes should pay for their faults.&quot;

== First trial and escape ==
Cesare Battisti was arrested and jailed in Italy on 26 February 1979, then sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison for participation in an &quot;armed group&quot; (&quot;partecipazione a banda armata&quot;). He was sentenced on the grounds of material evidence and testimony provided by two &quot;collaboratori di giustizia&quot; (defendants who testified against their former accomplice) who benefitted from lighter sentences for their testimony. The status of &quot;collaboratore di giustizia&quot;, also popularly known as &quot;pentito&quot;, was established by anti-terrorist legislation enacted during this period.

PAC militants organised Battisti&#x27;s escape on 4 October 1981, from Frosinone prison. He fled to Paris and then Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, Mexico, very shortly afterwards. While in Mexico, he founded a literary review, &quot;Via Libre&quot;, which is still active. He also participated in the creation of the Book Festival of Managua, Nicaragua, and organised the first Graphic Arts Biennal in Mexico. Battisti began to write at the suggestion of Paco Ignacio Taibo II and collaborated with various newspapers.

== Second trial ==
Pietro Mutti, one of the leaders of the PAC who had been sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; for the assassination of the prison guard Santoro, was arrested in 1982. He sought the status of &quot;collaboratore di giustizia&quot; and his testimony, which helped him reduce his sentence, implicated Battisti and an accomplice in the four assassinations claimed by the PAC. Battisti&#x27;s trial was thus reopened in 1987, and he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1988 for two assassinations (Santoro and DIGOS agent Campagna) and complicity in murder in the two others (jeweler Torregiani and butcher Sabbadin). The court sentenced him in 1995, on appeal, to a life-sentence. Two years earlier, the Court of Cassation had quashed, on procedural grounds, the case against Battisti&#x27;s accomplice, who had also been accused by Pietro Mutti.

== Return to France ==
In 1985, the Socialist President of France FranÃ§ois Mitterrand had indicated that &quot;leftist Italian activists who were not indicted for violent crimes and had given up terrorist activity would not be extradited to Italy&quot;; this became known as the &quot;Mitterrand doctrine&quot;. Many Italian political activists had fled to France during the 1970s-1980s. Trusting in this declaration, Battisti returned to France in 1990, where he was arrested at Italy&#x27;s request in 1991, when his sentence was confirmed in the Court of Cassation. He thus passed five months in Fresnes prison and then was freed after the extradition request was rejected by the Paris Appeal Court on 29 May 1991. French justice concluded that the anti-terrorist legislation enacted in Italy &quot;went against the French principles of law,&quot; which, along with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), prohibited in particular extradition of a person sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; if that person had not been in a condition to adequately defend himself during his trial. The court also declared the evidence against Battisti as &quot;contradictory&quot; and &quot;worthy of a military justice.&quot;

After his release in 1991, Battisti lived in Paris, where he wrote his first novel, &quot;Les Habits d&#x27;ombre&quot; (&quot;The shadow clothes&quot;). Two thrillers, &quot;L&#x27;Ombre rouge&quot; (&quot;The red shadow&quot;) and &quot;Buena onda&quot; (&quot;Good wave&quot;), took as their setting and backdrop the Parisian world of Italian fugitives from justice. Another major novel, titled &quot;DerniÃ¨res cartouches&quot; (&quot;Last bullets&quot;), takes place in Italy during the &quot;years of lead&quot;.

In 1997, jointly with other left-wing Italians who had fled to France and were accused of taking part in violent crimes, he asked the President of Italy at the time, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (DC), for amnesty without success.

==Arrest in France==
On 10 February 2004, the French government arrested Battisti at Italy&#x27;s request and planned to extradite him to Italy. On 30 June 2004, the Paris Court of Appeal approved his extradition. An appeal to the Court of Cassation was filed against this opinion and another to the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;Ãtat&quot; against the extradition decree. President Jacques Chirac stated on 2 July 2004 that he would not oppose the French justice system&#x27;s decision to extradite him. Perben confirmed Paris&#x27; new position: &quot;There is no ambiguity. There has been a change of attitude from France, and I support it&quot;, (in reference to the &quot;Mitterrand doctrine&quot;), among other reasons &quot;because of the European construction&quot;.

As of 2007, only Paolo Persichetti, former member of the &quot;UnitÃ  Comuniste Combattenti&quot;, among the 200 Italians involved in Court cases dealing with political violence requested by Italy, had been extradited (in August 2002). He was eventually sentenced to 22 years in prison. Minister Edouard Balladur signed Persichetti&#x27;s extradition decree in 1994; it was validated by the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;Etat&quot; the following year. According to RFI radio station, the Perben-Castelli agreement was divided in three parts: all events before 1982 would be prescribed &quot;except in case of exceptional gravity&quot;; facts between 1982 and 1993 would be &quot;examined on a case-by-case basis&quot;, in function of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) principle and of the &quot;conditions in which the trials took place in Italy&quot;.

Still claiming innocence, Cesare Battisti failed to check in at the local police station while on parole, and went underground on 21 August 2004.

On 18 March 2005, the French Conseil d&#x27;Etat (the French Supreme Court in administrative law), ruling ultimately for Battisti&#x27;s extradition, affirmed clearly that the Italian legislation did not conflict with the French principles of law. The Conseil established that:

In July 2005, the Italian press revealed the existence of the Department of Anti-terrorism Strategic Studies (DSSA), a &quot;parallel police&quot; created by Gaetano Saya, leader of &quot;New Italian Social Movement&quot; neofascist party, and Riccardo Sindoca, two leaders of the National Union of the Police Forces (&quot;Unpf&quot;). Both claimed they were former members of Gladio, NATO&#x27;s &quot;stay-behind&quot; paramilitary organization involved in Italy&#x27;s strategy of tension and various alleged activist acts. According to &quot;Il Messaggero&quot;, quoted by &quot;The Independent&quot;, judicial sources declared that wiretaps suggested DSSA members had been planning to kidnap Cesare Battisti.

On 5 February 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it expressed its trust &quot;that the re-examination of the decision on the extradition of Cesare Battisti will take into account the judgment delivered by an EU Member State in full compliance with the principle of the rule of law in the European Union&quot;.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), in its December 2006 decision, rejected Battisti&#x27;s claim that France&#x27;s extradition decision was illegitimate. The Court stated:

The applicant had patently been informed of the accusation against him and of the progress of the proceedings before the Italian courts, notwithstanding the fact that he had absconded. Furthermore, the applicant, who had deliberately chosen to remain on the run after escaping from prison, had received effective assistance during the proceedings from several lawyers specially appointed by him. Hence, the Italian and subsequently the French authorities had been entitled to conclude that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right to appear and be tried in person. The French authorities had therefore taken due account of all the circumstances of the case and of the Court&#x27;s case-law in granting the extradition request made by the Italian authorities: manifestly ill-founded.

== Arrest and asylum in Brazil ==

Battisti was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on 18 March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers. Later, the Brazilian Minister of Justice Tarso Genro granted him the status of political refugee, in a controversial decision which was much criticized in Italy, even in Brazil and the international press. On 5 February 2009, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of Italy and held a minute of silence in memory to Battisti&#x27;s victims. On 18 November 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Court considered the refugee status illegal and allowed extradition, but also stated that the Brazilian constitution gives the president personal powers to deny the extradition if he chooses to, effectively putting the final decision in the hands of Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. On 31 December 2010, on Lula&#x27;s last effective day as president, the decision not to allow extradition was officially announced.

Battisti was released on 9 June 2011 from prison after the Brazilian Constitutional Court denied Italy&#x27;s request to extradite him. Italy planned to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In March 2015 a federal judge ruled null and void the decision to grant him a permanency visa as it would conflict with Brazilian law, ordering his deportation. On 14 September, the sixth section of the Regional Federal Courts of the First Region (seated in BrasÃ­lia) declared the deportation of Battisti illegal. In December 2018, Brazilian President Michel Temer signed the order to extradite Battisti after the Brazilian Supreme Court ordered his arrest. He fled justice after this and escaped to Bolivia, where he was finally arrested on 12 January 2019. He was extradited to Italy the day after, where he is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment.

After Brazil granted him refugee status through a decision of its Minister of Justice Tarso Genro. Battisti&#x27;s request for asylum was first denied by the National Committee for Refugees, in a decision taken by simple majority. His defense appealed to the Minister of Justice, who granted in January 2009 refugee status, a decision which divided Brazilian public opinion.

Italian President Giorgio Napolitano wrote to Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, informing him of the &quot;emotion and understandable reactions&quot; raised in his country, in public opinion and among political forces by this &quot;grave decision&quot;. Italian Justice Minister, Angelino Alfano, has asked Brazilian authorities to reconsider this decision &quot;in the light of international cooperation against terrorism&quot;. Lula answered Napolitano, mentioning that Genro&#x27;s decision is founded on the Brazilian constitution and on the UN 1951 Convention on Refugee Status and is an act of sovereignty of Brazil.

Criticism was also based on speculations about the influence exerted by Carla Bruni, spouse of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, on Genro&#x27;s decision. Brazilian Senator Eduardo Suplicy attested to &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; that Bruni herself asked Lula to refuge Battisti. Bruni denied this claim on a RAI interview as she expressed her condolences with the families of Battisti&#x27;s victims.

On 29 December 2010, unofficial reports in Italy and Brazil said President Lula was about to announce he was denying extradition of Battisti, just three days short before the end of his presidential term. The official announcement did take place on 31 December, hours before the end of Lula&#x27;s time in office.

On 8 June 2011, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that Lula&#x27;s decision is final. Italian authorities announced their intention to appeal to the International Court of Justice saying Brazil breached an extradition treaty.

In March 2015, a federal judge ruled null and void a decision to grant him a permanent visa as this would conflict with Brazilian law, and ordered his deportation. The judge stressed that the deportation should not be confused with extradition, as it does not require that Battisti be surrendered to Italy, but rather to the country from which he entered Brazil, or any other country that will agree to receive him.

In June 2015 Battisti married Joice Lima, a Brazilian citizen.

==Extradition to Italy==
On 12 January 2019, Battisti was arrested by an Italian team of Interpol officers in Santa Cruz de La Sierra, Bolivia, and returned to Italy to start serving his sentence. On 25 March 2019, Battisti acknowledged his responsibilities in the crimes attributed to him, pleading guilty. He was imprisoned in the Costantino Satta Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison of Ferrara; however, in 2022 he was transferred to a regular penitentiary in Parma. The transferring was strongly criticized by the centre-right coalition (particularly the right-wing to far-right League and Brothers of Italy) and by the families of Battisti&#x27;s victims.

==Public opinion==
Until 25 March 2019, Cesare Battisti denied having committed any of the murders he had been sentenced for; on that date he admitted to the chief prosecutor of Milan (Francesco Greco) involvement in four killings. The circumstances of his sentence have been questioned. A movement claiming Battisti&#x27;s innocence is active in the media and in public opinion (especially in France and Italy). Among the most vocal supporters of Battisti are the writers Fred Vargas, Valerio Evangelisti and Bernard-Henri LÃ©vy. They consider that the trials conducted in Italy were marked by irregularities. These alleged irregularities involved the use of torture (Battisti&#x27;s French lawyers have not used this peculiar charge, the violation of article 3 ECHR, in their rejected claim to ECtHR), and the misuse of witnesses: according to Battisti&#x27;s supporters, witnesses against Battisti were either affected by mental troubles, or were &quot;collaboratori di giustizia&quot; (that is, defendants testifying against other defendants in order to benefit from a reduced sentence. Those peculiar witnesses are also used by French justice, i.e. art. 132â78 French &quot;Code pÃ©nal&quot;). Battisti&#x27;s supporters also claim that ballistic analysis and graphological expertises used in Italian court cases do in fact exonerate Battisti, contrary to what the courts considered.

Most of public opinion in Italy disagrees with those views, and Battisti&#x27;s arrest in Brazil has been commented upon favourably in the media. Rifondazione Comunista, however, claims that he should not be extradited, as he would not be granted the right to a new trial. In France, supporters of Battisti, such as Gilles Perrault, have called the 2007 arrest, a few weeks before the April 2007 presidential election, an &quot;electoral feat&quot;, closely timed by the then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, candidate for the UMP conservative party. FranÃ§ois Bayrou, candidate for the UDF right-of-center party, has called for a new trial, as have members of the left-wing.

Defenders of Battisti, among whom the Human Rights League (LDH), consider that France&#x27;s decision to extradite Battisti was illegal, since Battisti would not have the right to a new trial after having been judged &quot;in absentia&quot;. The right to a new trial is not a sufficient guarantee for the defendant, as clearly ruled by the ECHR in the case of &quot;Krombach v. France&quot;, application no. 29731/96; and also article 6 of ECHR, the juridical ground of Battisti&#x27;s claim against extradition, doesn&#x27;t prescribe a new trial. ECHR establishes that there is not an absolute right to a new trial after a trial in absentia. Battisti&#x27;s claim concerned the defendant&#x27;s knowledge of the trial, and Battisti&#x27;s lawyers argued that the defendant had not been in a position to know that in Italy there was a trial against him, and therefore his rights had been violated.

The &quot;Union syndicale des magistrats&quot; (USM, the largest trade union of French judges) has supported the fairness of the Italian trial in absentia and has also confirmed the legality of Battisti&#x27;s sentence.

<text>Mason Science College was a university college in Birmingham, England, and a predecessor college of the University of Birmingham. Founded in 1875 by industrialist and philanthropist Sir Josiah Mason, the college was incorporated into the University of Birmingham in 1900. Two students of the college, Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin, later went on to become prime ministers of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The college was established by an English industrialist and philanthropist Sir Josiah Mason in 1875. The building of the college in Edmund Street, Birmingham was designed by Jethro Cossins and opened on 1 October 1880 and was marked by a speech by Thomas Henry Huxley. In the speech, Huxley considered the opening of the college as a victory for scientific cause and supported Mason&#x27;s antagonistic views on the classics and theology. The college developed various liberal and vocational subjects, but forced out the artisans. The medical and scientific departments of Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham moved to the nearby Mason Science College.

In 1898, it became Mason University College, with Joseph Chamberlain becoming the President of Court of Governors of the college. In 1900 it was incorporated into the University of Birmingham. Students at the college were awarded their degrees by the University of London until the University of Birmingham was established and received degree awarding powers in its own right.

William A. Tilden was professor of chemistry from 1880 to 1894. In September 1893, Francis William Aston began his university studies at the college, where he was taught physics by John Henry Poynting and chemistry by Frankland and Tilden.

In 1881, Charles Lapworth became the first professor of geology at the college. In 1891, physics professor John Henry Poynting successfully calculated the mean density of the Earth.

The Mason College building housed Birmingham University&#x27;s Faculties of Arts and Law for over half a century after the founding of the University in 1900. The Faculty of Arts building on the Edgbaston campus was not constructed until 1959â61. The Faculties of Arts and Law then moved to the Edgbaston Campus.

After the Second World War, the style of architecture was not as appreciated as it is now. Paul Cadbury referred to it in 1952 as a &quot;neo-gothic monstrosity&quot; and expected it to be demolished within 50 years. In the event, it was demolished in 1964, along with the original Central Public Library and the Birmingham and Midland Institute, as part of the redevelopment within the inner ring road. The former Central Library stood on the site of the old college, the library having moved to a new site in 2013; the building was demolished in 2016.

==Departments==
During the first academic session of the college in 1880 courses in physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics were offered to students. By 1881 courses in geology and mineralogy, botany and vegetable physiology, engineering, English language and literature, Greek and Latin, and French and German language and literature were also available. From 1882 Medical students at Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham were able to attend classes in botany, physiology and chemistry, and in 1892 the medical faculty of Queen&#x27;s College was transferred to Mason College. There was also a short-lived department of &#x27;Mental and Moral Science&#x27;, which was not successful despite funds being gifted specifically to support the endeavor in 1882.

<text>Vincenzo Peruggia (8 October 1881 8 October 1925) was an Italian decorator best known for stealing the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; from the Louvre, a museum in Paris where he had briefly worked as glazier, on 21 August 1911.

== Early life and work at the Louvre ==
Vincenzo Peruggia was born Pietro Vincenzo Antonio Peruggia, the son of Celeste Rossi and Giacomo Peruggia, on 8 October 1881 in Dumenza, a small village in the Alps of Italy near the border with Switzerland. For a brief period after having moved to Paris in 1908, Peruggia obtained work at the Louvre, cleaning and reframing paintings. His job also required him to construct strong cases for some of the arts in the museum, including the one for the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci; he was likely involved in &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;â³s box frame construction and would have known how to open it in minutes. After the painting was stolen, a curator investigated the matter and listed all the names involved, including Peruggia&#x27;s. There was not much security at the Louvre, and its entry was free.

== Theft ==

In 1911, Peruggia perpetrated what has been described as the greatest art theft of the 20th century. According to Peruggia&#x27;s later interrogation in Florence, following his arrest on 12 December 1913, he stated to have entered the Louvre on Monday, 21 August 1911, at around 7 am, through the door where the other Louvre workers were entering, wearing one of the white smocks that museum employees customarily wore, making himself indistinguishable from the other workers. It was a quiet morning and the Louvre was nearly empty since 21 August was the weekly closure day during the summer holidays.

When the Salon CarrÃ©, where the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; hung, was empty, Peruggia lifted the painting off the four iron pegs that secured it to the wall between Antonio da Correggio&#x27;s &quot;Mystical Marriage&quot; and Titian&#x27;s &quot;Allegory of Alfonso d&#x27;Avalos&quot; and took it to a nearby service stairway of the &quot;Sept MÃ¨tres&quot;. There, he removed the protective case and frame, hiding the discarded elements behind some student artworks stored on the staircase landing. Some people report that he concealed the painting (which Leonardo da Vinci painted on wood) under his smock that was larger than him; however, Peruggia was only tall, and the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; measures approximately , so it would not fit under a smock worn by someone of his size. Instead, he told investigators that he took off his smock and wrapped it around the painting, before tucking it under his arm, and left the Louvre through the same door he had entered.

When Peruggia hid the painting, he was stuck in a locked service door. A plumber, thinking he was an employee (Peruggia had finished working for the Louvre), unlocked the door for him, and Peruggia successfully left the museum. He then hid the painting in his apartment in Paris. The theft was not discovered until the following day, when a painter who was about to do a copy of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; found it missing. The director, who was on holiday, had boasted &quot;steal the Mona Lisa? That would be like thinking that someone could steal the towers of Notre Dame cathedral.&quot; The arts minister was also away, having ordered &quot;don&#x27;t call me unless the Louvre burns down or the Joconde is stolen.&quot; At least 60 policemen scoured the Louvre in search of clues, and the top officer in charge of the investigation sounded confident, as he stated: &quot;The theft took place on closing day, we know who came in and out, this investigation will only take two to three days.&quot; Two Germans, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, and the painter Pablo Picasso were arrested, and all passengers of an ocean liner set to sail were also searched. In New York, the police searched another ship in an attempt to retrieve the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.

=== Investigation and recovery ===

Having interrogated all of the Louvre&#x27;s permanent staff, the National Gendarmerie began to interview extraneous workers including bricklayers, decorators, and staff hired for short periods or for specific jobs in September 1911. During this period, officers visited Peruggia&#x27;s apartment and questioned him twice about his possible involvement; he was not considered a primary suspect. It was only after Peruggia had failed to come to the police station twice that the police went to his apartment, where the painting was hidden. The detective failed to see it and believed Peruggia&#x27;s explanations; the detective finished to write his report by leaning on the table under which the painting was hidden in a cavity. Despite the examining judge&#x27;s order to follow the curators who had pointed to glazers as prime suspects, the police did not follow that lead.

Peruggia had left a thumbprint on the glass securing the painting, and his fingerprints and photo were in police files as he had been arrested before. The police also knew that he had helped make the protective glass for the painting and that he was not working at the time of the robbery. All the museum employees had their fingerprints taken but not Peruggia, and the police forgot to add his name to the list of fingerprints to check against police records. Days after the theft, speculations began and a newspaper wrote an article imagining to interview Mona Lisa, while others speculated that the theft was a &quot;crime of passion&quot;, joked that ArsÃ¨ne Lupin was involved, and movies and songs poked fun at the turn of events. Knowing that a story could sell millions of copies, newspapers offered financial rewards for information, and for over two years, hundreds of false leads were sent to the police and the press. A witness described being &quot;in the company of numerous other curious visitors, to stare at the empty space on the wall of the Louvre where the famous lady had hung.&quot;

After keeping the painting hidden in a trunk in his apartment for two years, Peruggia returned to Italy with it by train, after he saw adverts by antique dealers in an Italian newspaper. He kept it in his apartment in Florence for some time. Peruggia eventually grew impatient and was finally caught when he contacted Alfredo Geri, the owner of an art gallery in Florence, using the name Leonardo V. Geri&#x27;s story conflicts with Peruggia&#x27;s but it was clear that Peruggia expected a reward for returning the painting to what he regarded as its homeland. Geri called in Giovanni Poggi, director of the Uffizi, who authenticated the painting. Poggi and Geri, after taking the painting for safekeeping, informed the police, who arrested Peruggia at his hotel, with the painting placed under his bed. After its recovery, the painting was exhibited all over Italy with banner headlines rejoicing its return. The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was then returned to the Louvre in 1913. While the painting was famous before the theft, the notoriety it received from the newspaper headlines and the large scale police investigation helped the artwork become one of the best known in the world, gaining considerable public interest. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described how &quot;Florentines in riot over &#x27;Mona Lisa&#x27;. Crowd of 30,000 sweeps police aside in mad rush to see stolen painting.&quot;

=== Motivations ===
There are two predominant theories regarding the theft of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. Peruggia said he did it for a patriotic reason as he wanted to bring the painting back for display in Italy, in Peruggia&#x27;s own words &quot;after it was stolen from Italy&quot; by Napoleon. When Peruggia worked at the Louvre, he learned of how Napoleon plundered many Italian works of art during the Napoleonic Wars. Perhaps sincere in his motive, Peruggia proclaimed &quot;I am an Italian and I do not want the picture given back to the Louvre&quot;, and may not have known that Leonardo da Vinci took this painting as a gift for King Francis I when he moved to France to become a painter in his court during the 16th century, 250 years before Napoleon&#x27;s birth. Experts question the patriotism motive on the grounds thatâif patriotism was the true motiveâPeruggia would have donated the painting to an Italian museum rather than have attempted to profit from its sale. The question of money is also confirmed by letters that Peruggia sent to his father after the theft. On 22 December 1911, four months after the theft, he wrote that Paris was where &quot;I will make my fortune and that his [fortune] will arrive in one shot.&quot; The following year, he wrote: &quot;I am making a vow for you to live long and enjoy the prize that your son is about to realize for you and for all our family.&quot;

Put on trial, the court agreed to some extent that Peruggia committed his crime for patriotic reasons and gave him a lenient sentence. He was sent to jail for one year and 15 days but was hailed as a great patriot in Italy and on appeal served only seven months. The invocation of mental infirmity was confirmed by a riddle posed to him by the court psychiatrist Paolo Amaldi, who took up his post on 24 May 1914. The riddle was &quot;There are two birds in a tree. If a hunter shoots one of them, how many are left in the tree?&quot; As Peruggia replied &quot;One!&quot;, Amaldi called him &quot;imbecile&quot; as the answer to the riddle was zero because the other bird would have escaped. This, alongside popular pressure, had the effect of inducing the court to grant him extenuating circumstances and to impose the lenient sentence. After Peruggia&#x27;s arrest, the patriotic Peruggism died down as most people were disappointed in Peruggia&#x27;s calibre, and he has since been compared more to Lee Harvey Oswald than the criminal mastermind he was originally imagined. In the words of Donald Sassoon in his book &quot;Becoming Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;[Peruggia] was, quite clearly, a classic loser.&quot;

Peruggia, who could not pay his hotel bill, ultimately did not profit from his theft and did not make any money from it. If he wanted to make money from a theft, he could have stolen from the Louvre a 140-carat diamond or take gold objects to melt them, without ever being caught. At the same time, money were on his mind, and his notebook before the theft contained names of billionaires like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, and traveled to London to try to sell the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, as also evidenced by the court trial, where it was revealed the dealer Duveen had laughed at him. Another theory later emerged, claiming the theft may have been encouraged or masterminded by Eduardo de Valfierno, a con man who had commissioned the French art forger Yves Chaudron to make copies of the painting so he could sell them as the missing original. The copies would have gone up in value if the original were stolen. This theory is based entirely on a 1932 article by former Hearst journalist Karl Decker in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Decker claimed to have known Valfierno and heard the story from him in 1913, promising not to print it until he learned of Valfierno&#x27;s death. There is no external confirmation for this theory.

== Later life ==

Peruggia was released from jail after a short time and served in the Italian army during World War I. During the war, he was captured by Austria-Hungary and held as a prisoner of war for two years until the war ended and he was released. He later married Annunciata Rossi, had one daughter named Celestina, returned to France, and continued to work as a painter decorator using his birth name Pietro Peruggia. He died from a heart attack on 8 October 1925 (his 44th birthday) in the Paris suburb of Saint-Maur-des-FossÃ©s. He was buried in the CondÃ© Cemetery of Saint-Maur-des-FossÃ©s. Sometime in the 1950s, Peruggia&#x27;s remains were exhumed and relocated into the cemetery bonelocker. His death in 1925 was not widely reported by the media at the time, possibly because he died under the name of Pietro Peruggia; obituaries appeared mistakenly only when another Vincenzo Peruggia died in Haute-Savoie in 1947.

== In popular culture ==
Peruggia&#x27;s theft is part of popular culture, and over the years it has been celebrated in books, films, and songs including the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; written in 1978 by Ivan Graziani. In &quot;Der Raub der Mona Lisa&quot; (1931), an early German sound film, Peruggia was portrayed by Willi Forst. In an April 1956 episode of the TV show &quot;You Are There&quot;, called &quot;The Recovery of the Mona Lisa (December 10, 1913)&quot;, Peruggia is played by Vito Scotti, who reprised the role in another TV reconstruction of the famous theft, this time for the TV-show &quot;GE True&quot;. The episode was called &quot;The Tenth Mona Lisa&quot; and aired in March 1963. Liana Bortolon&#x27;s book &quot;The Life and Times of Leonardo&quot; also mentioned the theft. In &quot;The Man Who Stole La Gioconda&quot; (it) (2006), a television miniseries, Peruggia was portrayed by Alessandro Preziosi.

In March 2012, Peruggia&#x27;s mugshot was sold for â¬3,825 to an Italian buyer by the Parisian auction house Tajan. The small original silver gelatin print (123 x 54 mm) had been estimated by photography expert Jean-Mathieu Martini at between â¬1,500 and â¬1,800, excluding fees. The mugshot was taken in 1909 by Alphonse Bertillon, the inventor of the anthropometry system. In the summer of 2012, Peruggia&#x27;s character was the hero of a play that depicted him as a patriot. The play was performed in his hometown of Dumenza, Lombardy. In a 2018 episode of &quot;Drunk History&quot; on Comedy Central, he was portrayed by Jack Black. In a 2023 episode of &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; called &quot;Murdoch and the Mona Lisa&quot;, he was portrayed by Johnathan Sousa. In the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, the theft is referenced by the Minions when they stole the Mona Lisa painting from its protective chamber.

<doc id="926124" wikidata="Q5563041" url="?curid=926124" title="Ginger Grant">
<text>Ginger Grant is a fictional character portrayed by Tina Louise in the 1964 to 1967 television sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Grant was initially portrayed by Kit Smythe. She is known for casually mentioning big movie stars as her acquaintances. Ginger is often seen helping the Professor with his experiments and sharing romantic scenes with him. She is also the object of desire for The Skipper in several episodes. Ginger sides with Thurston Howell III on many occasions and becomes close friends with Mary Ann. On the island, she takes on various roles such as chanteuse, fortune-teller, and hair stylist. In the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; reunion films, Louise declined to return, and her role was played by Judith Baldwin and Constance Forslund. Jayne Mansfield was initially offered the role of Ginger but turned it down, leading to Louise&#x27;s casting.

== Character summary ==
Born in New York City on September 1, 1937, Grant is a &quot;movie star&quot; and would casually mention names of some of the biggest movie stars of the day as her co-stars or acquaintances to the Castaways, suggesting that she too was a great star. In season 1 episode 1, &quot;Two on a Raft&quot;, Ginger is singing in a club in Waikiki, the same gig mentioned by the radio announcer, after which she was seen boarding the tour boat still wearing the evening gown from her performance. &quot;When I first broke into show business, I used to work with a magician&quot;, Ginger confesses in Season 1 Episode 33 &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot;. In the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;&#x27;s pilot, actress Kit Smythe portrayed Ginger, who was then a secretary.

Ginger was sometimes seen helping the Professor with his experiments, dressed in a lab coat and spectacle frames and they conspired together in the episode &quot;Ship Ahoax&quot; to make it appear as though she were fortune-telling. They also shared romantic scenes, although these were usually in the form of a &quot;lesson in love&quot; such as in the episodes &quot;Erika Tiffany-Smith to the Rescue&quot; and &quot;The Postman Cometh&quot;.

She also appears to have been the object of desire of The Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.) in several episodes. The Skipper chooses Ginger as his preferred contestant in the &quot;Miss Castaway Pageant&quot; held on the island (Season 2 Episode 2 &quot;Beauty Is as Beauty Does&quot;). In addition, when Skipper loses his memory in the first season Episode 30 &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;, he is much more attracted to Ginger than Mary Ann, asking Ginger, &quot;Hi, beautiful, what&#x27;s your name?&quot; while leering at her with delight. Ginger does not know about the Skipper&#x27;s memory loss and she answers, with appropriate Hollywood pique, &quot;Ginger, big boy, what&#x27;s yours?&quot; While the name Ginger is normally the dirivitive of Virginia, it was never mentioned if she used a stage name or not.

Ginger sides with Thurston Howell III on many occasions â acting as a witness during a trial over treasure, serving as a sort of spy to divulge information from Gilligan by scratching his back, and allowing herself to be bribed by Howell, such as during the election of who was to be president of the island. Her secret agent code name and her measurements were both 36-25-36.

She also becomes close friends with Mary Ann; the two are around the same age. The actresses were born in 1934 and 1938, respectively.

Ginger Grant, due to many prior film roles in Hollywood, spent her time on the island occasionally taking on the roles of chanteuse, barefoot fortune-teller, lab assistant, hair stylist, and psychoanalystÂ â as well as fronting the hastily formed island musical trio: The Honeybees. She also had to deal with a doppelganger, a plain mousy girl named Eva Grubb (also played by Tina Louise).

Unlike the other female castaways, who were seen in more than one set of clothes, Ginger initially appeared only in her evening gown. Later episodes did include changes in apparel for her as well.

== The character in &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; reunion films ==
For the 1978 made-for-TV-movie, &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, Tina Louise declined to return, for she believed the role had typecast her forever as a glamour queen; she was replaced by Judith Baldwin. Baldwin also portrayed Ginger in the sequel &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1979), but did not return for the third sequel, &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981); therefore, Constance Forslund, stepped in to play the &quot;movie star&quot;.

== Casting == 
Jayne Mansfield, a late-1950s sex symbol was offered the role of Ginger after the departure of Kit Smythe, who played Ginger as a secretary in the pilot. When Ginger was converted to a movie star, the producers swapped the actresses and asked Mansfield who was Marilyn Monroe-esque, to portray the character. However, she turned it down and was replaced by Tina Louise. For several years, there had been rumors that Louise disliked the character and for years felt it had stymied her career as a &quot;serious&quot; actress. However, in December 2020, Louise denied that she ever resented the role of Ginger Grant, &quot;Never true â I loved doing my part, especially after they really started writing for my character, originally billed as a âMarilyn Monroeâ type of character. A different director took over and really started to write for my character. I really loved my character.&quot; Louise also said that she was very grateful to the show&#x27;s fans for their continued support over the years especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;We brought a lot of joy to people and still do. This show is an escape from so many things going on. Fathers share it with their children now. I get letters all the time about that.&quot; Judith Baldwin played her in the first and second reunion films. Constance Forslund played her in the third and final reunion film to date. Kristen Dalton played Ginger in &quot;Surviving Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Tina Louise did not reprise her role in the animated-spinoffs either: in &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; Jane Webb voiced her, while in &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; she was replaced by her co-star Dawn Wells. Roseanne Barr portrayed the role of Ginger in a parody episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

<text>HajdÃº, formerly known as HajdÃºsÃ¡g, was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. The capital of the county was Debrecen. The territory of the county is now part of the Hungarian county HajdÃº-Bihar.

==Geography==
HajdÃº county shared borders with the counties Heves, Borsod, Szabolcs, Bihar, BÃ©kÃ©s and JÃ¡sz-Nagykun-Szolnok. The river Tisza touched its western border. The HortobÃ¡gy National Park steppe lies in the county. Its area was 3343Â kmÂ² around 1910.

==History==
The HajdÃºsÃ¡g region had a special status in the Kingdom of Hungary, but was turned into the proper county HajdÃº in the 19th century. At the 1950 county reform, it was merged with Bihar County (the Hungarian part of pre-Trianon Bihar County) and some smaller parts of the former Szabolcs County to form HajdÃº-Bihar County, with its capital at Debrecen.

==Subdivisions==

<text>The L. P. Fisher Public Library, started in 1912 and completed in 1914, is a landmark in the town of Woodstock, New Brunswick, Canada. Named for Lewis Peter Fisher (1821-1905), a loyalist lawyer, mayor, and leading citizen of Woodstock who bequeathed $208,000 (a considerable sum in 1905) for local charitable purposes, including the construction of a free library.

The library was designed in a Greek Revival style by architect G. Ernest Fairweather of Saint John, New Brunswick and after two years of construction was completed in 1914. The exterior is brick with limestone trim, and the interior is furnished in Honduran mahogany. There is a time capsule buried in the cornerstone. The front steps are of granite, as are the foundations of the building.

The historical collections of the library include 19th century census records, maps, newspapers, family histories, military and cemetery records.

An expansion and restructuring of the library began in 2013 and was completed in 2015.

==Statistics (1999-2000)==
*Size: 546Â m2 (5877 square feet)
*Total Collection: 26,253 volumes
*Annual Circulation: 79,901 volumes

==The library in popular media==

The building is seen in the 2000 movie Ricky 6. The facade was temporarily altered to feature a different name and an American flag was flown from the flagpole. The interior was also altered and repainted for use in the film; however upon the completion of principal photography, the producers of the movie arranged for the interior furnishings to be left in better condition than they had been before the start of production.

<text>John Kite (died 1537) was successively Archbishop of Armagh, 1513â1521, and Bishop of Carlisle, 1521â1537.

==Biography==
John Kite was educated at Eton College and then at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was graduated Bachelor of Canon Law. He was appointed a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral and Sub-Dean of the King&#x27;s Chapel, Westminster in 1510. From 1510â1518 he was prebendary of Stratton in the diocese of Salisbury.

In 1518, as archbishop, he accompanied John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners on an embassy to Charles I of Spain and was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. In 1522 he was living at Rose Castle, Cumberland when he was visited by Dr William Burbank, Archdeacon of Carlisle Cathedral, of whom he wrote to Cardinal Wolsey. His alliance with Wolsey may explain his quick promotion. He took the Oath of Supremacy in 1534.

<text>BluesWay Records was an American subsidiary label of ABC-Paramount Records, begun by Bob Thiele in 1966. Artists such as John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Reed, Jimmy Rushing, Otis Spann, and T-Bone Walker were among those who signed for the label. BluesWay released B. B. King&#x27;s 1969 &quot;Live and Well&quot; and &quot;Completely Well&quot; albums, the latter containing his hit &quot;The Thrill is Gone&quot;. The label also released the James Gang&#x27;s first album, 1969&#x27;s &quot;Yer&#x27; Album&quot;.

BluesWay ceased operations in 1970, with Hooker, King and James Gang being transferred to the parent ABC Records label. The imprint was briefly revived in 1973â74. The BluesWay masters, along with the rest of ABC Records&#x27; assets, were sold to MCA Records in 1978.

<text>Esteban Luis Yan (born June 22, 1975) is a Dominican former professional baseball pitcher. He played in all or parts of 11 seasons in Major League Baseball. At , , he batted and threw right-handed.

==Early years==
Yan was originally signed by the Atlanta Braves as an amateur free agent in 1990. He was traded along with Tony Tarasco and Roberto Kelly from the Braves to the Montreal Expos for Marquis Grissom on April 6, 1995. After spending time in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut with the Baltimore Orioles on May 20, 1996.

==Professional career==
===Baltimore===

Yan made his major league debut on May 20, 1996 with the Baltimore Orioles. He appeared in just four games with the Orioles that season while making just 3 appearances the following season.

===Tampa Bay===

In 1998, Yan pitched for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In 64 games, he posted an ERA of 3.86 in innings. In 1999, his ERA ballooned to 5.90 in 50 games. In 2000, Yan pitched between the rotation and the bullpen, appearing in 43 games while starting 20 of them. He was 7â8 in innings.

On June 4, 2000, Yan hit a home run in his first major league at-bat, on the first pitch. His next plate appearance resulted in a sacrifice bunt, which does not count as an official at bat. In his only other career plate appearance (on June 30, 2003, as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals), he hit a single, giving him a 1.000 batting average and a 2.500 slugging percentage.

In the 2001 season, Yan served as closer for the Devil Rays, saving 22 games in 54 appearances. Yan began the 2002 season as the Devil Rays closer before being removed of the role during the season, he finished with a record of 7â8 in 55 games with 19 saves.

===Texas===

On December 26, 2002, Yan signed a one-year deal with the Texas Rangers. In 15 games, he was 0â1 with a 6.94 ERA.

===St. Louis===

He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals on May 26, 2003, for a minor league outfielder and cash.

===Detroit===

In 2004, Yan pitched for the Detroit Tigers. He rebounded from the previous three seasons, as his ERA sat at a career-low 3.83 in a career-high 69 appearances.

===California===

In 2005, Yan pitched for the Angels. He was 1â1 in 49 games. In 2006, he began the season with the Angels.

===Cincinnati===

He was then traded to the Cincinnati Reds on May 30.

===Asia===
Yan spent the 2007 season as a pitcher for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League. In 2008, Yan rejoined the Orioles organization, but this time with its minor league affiliate the Norfolk Tides. Yan was released on July 18, 2008. He signed with SK Wyverns of the Korean Baseball League in July 2008 and spent the rest of the season with them.

===Mexico===
Yan spent the first half of 2009 pitching for the Bridgeport Bluefish, an unaffiliated minor league team in the Atlantic League. On August 11, 2009, Yan signed a minor league contract with the Florida Marlins and was assigned to the New Orleans Zephyrs. However, he failed the physical and stayed with Bridgeport. He signed with the Diablos Rojos del MÃ©xico to start 2010, then returned to the Bluefish, by whom he was activated on August 17. He returned to the Bluefish in 2011, splitting the season between Bridgeport and the Vaqueros Laguna of the Mexican League. He signed with the Saraperos de Saltillo for the 2012 season.

==Television==
Yan is the first member of the Tampa Bay Rays to be named on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In the March 16, 2003, episode entitled &quot;C. E. D&#x27;oh!,&quot; Bart Simpson exclaims &quot;Look at me! I&#x27;m Tomokazu Ohka of the Montreal Expos!&quot; while playing baseball, to which Milhouse replies &quot;Well, I&#x27;m Esteban Yan of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays!&quot;, referencing the relative obscurity of the two pitchers and their respective teams.

<text>codice_1 is a terminal pager program on Unix, Windows, and Unix-like systems used to view (but not change) the contents of a text file one screen at a time. It is similar to , but has the extended capability of allowing both forward and backward navigation through the file. Unlike most Unix text editors/viewers, does not need to read the entire file before starting, allowing for immediate viewing regardless of file size.

==History==
Mark Nudelman initially wrote codice_1 during 1983â85, in the need of a version of codice_3 able to do backward scrolling of the displayed text. The name came from the joke of doing &quot;backwards more.&quot; Originally, codice_1 was developed for Unix, but it has been ported to a number of other operating systems, including MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, OS/2, and OS-9, as well as Unix-like systems such as Linux. It is still maintained today by Nudelman.

To help remember the difference between codice_1 and codice_6, a common joke is to say, &quot;,&quot; implying that codice_1 has greater functionality than . A similar saying is that &quot;codice_1 is codice_6, more or less&quot;.

==Usage==
 can be invoked with options to change its behaviour, for example, the number of lines to display on the screen. A few options vary depending on the operating system. While is displaying the file, various commands can be used to navigate through the file. These commands are based on those used by both and . It is also possible to search for character patterns in the file.

By default, displays the contents of the file to the standard output (one screen at a time). If the file name argument is omitted, it displays the contents from standard input (usually the output of another command through a pipe). If the output is redirected to anything other than a terminal, for example a pipe to another command, behaves like .

The &quot;lesspipe&quot; extension can automatically determine file types such as PDF, multimedia, and compressed archives, and automatically determines which program to launch display the file&#x27;s information with, such as text from a PDF file, metadata of photos, lists of files in a compressed archive, and content of a single file in a compressed archive.

The command-syntax is:

 less [options] [file_name]...

===Frequently used options===
*codice_10: Highlight just the current match of any searched string.
*codice_11: Search case-insensitively.
*codice_12: Show more detailed prompt, including file position.
*codice_13: Show line numbers (useful for viewing source code).
*codice_14: Set tabstops (the number of columns per hard tab character) to the specified number (3, in this example) (useful for viewing source code).
*codice_15: Disable line wrapping (&quot;chop long lines&quot;). Long lines can be seen by side-scrolling.
*codice_16: Leave file contents on screen when less exits.
*codice_17: Show help.
*codice_18: Follow mode, for log files that get replaced while being viewed.

===Frequently used commands===

==Examples==

less -M readme.txt # Read &quot;readme.txt&quot;
less +F /var/log/mail.log # Follow mode for log
file * | less # Easier file analysis
less -I -p void *.c # Case insensitive search for &quot;void&quot; in all .c files
==Memory considerations==
The codice_19 and codice_20 options control how much memory less may use to buffer inputs. This is most relevant when less is directly accessing a named file that is modified or deleted while less is still running, and when less is receiving data from a pipe and the data can not be randomly accessed or regenerated. On the other hand, unlimited buffering means that less will request as much memory as it is fed data, which could drive the system into using virtual memory and swapping a lot of data between RAM and disks (dramatically slowing system performance for most applications on the host), or even further into memory exhaustion where any application on the host requesting memory may have that request denied, or may crash when attempting to access memory that the OS promised but can&#x27;t find when the application actually attempts to use it and a page-fault occurs. For this reason, some companies/organisations insist that less be used only with fixed buffering - or not at all - on production machines.

<text>The Date with Destiny Adventure series comprises two short novels of interactive fiction published by Quirk Books in 2003 that parodied the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series. Both books featured covers and interior designs similar to those of the old Choose Your Own Adventure books, but have adult themes. The first book, &quot;Night of a Thousand Boyfriends,&quot; is similar to the television show &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, and the second book, &quot;Escape from Fire Island&quot;, is set on Fire Island, part of which is a famous gay resort.

<text>MÃ¡ramaros County (; ; ; ; ; ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in north-western Romania and western Ukraine. The capital of the county was MÃ¡ramarossziget (present-day Sighetu MarmaÈiei).

==Geography==

MÃ¡ramaros county shared borders with the Austrian crownlands Galicia (now in Poland and Ukraine) and Bukovina (now in Romania and Ukraine) and the Hungarian counties Bereg, Ugocsa, SzatmÃ¡r, Szolnok-Doboka and Beszterce-NaszÃ³d. It was situated on both sides of the river Tisza, and in the Carpathian Mountains. Its area was 9,716Â km2 around 1910.

==History==
The first mention of the region in the written sources is from 1199 (&quot;cum in Maramorisio tempore venationis venatum ivissemus&quot;). In the 13th century, it was almost uninhabited or very scarcely inhabited. In 1343, the Voivodeship of MaramureÈ, granted to a small Romanian nobility, was established. The region was reorganized into the MÃ¡ramaros County in 1402. The growth of its population started when the five crown cities (MÃ¡ramarossziget, HosszÃºmezÅ, Huszt, TÃ©csÅ, Visk) were founded in the same century. In 1920, after the Treaty of Trianon, the northern part of the county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia (Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;). The southern part (including Sighetu MarmaÈiei) became part of Romania.

The northern part was returned to Hungary by the annexation of the remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia after Czechoslovakia ceased to exist in 1939, however the redeemed territories of the former county remained separate from the administrative branch office of MÃ¡ramaros. After the Second Vienna Award, the rest of the county became part of Hungary as well and MÃ¡ramaros County was recreated on this territory, with MÃ¡ramarossziget as capital. Afterwards, the northern part of MÃ¡ramaros county along with the administrative branch offices of MÃ¡ramaros became part of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian SSR, Zakarpattia Oblast. Since 1991, when the Soviet Union split up, the Zakarpattya region is part of Ukraine.

The southern part of the county is now part of the Romanian county MaramureÈ.

<text>The Company of the Ring, also called the Fellowship of the Ring and the Nine Walkers, is a fictional group of nine representatives from the free peoples of Middle-earth: Elves, Dwarves, Men, and Hobbits; and a Wizard. The group is described in the first volume of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, itself titled &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The number nine is chosen, as the book&#x27;s author J. R. R. Tolkien states, to match and oppose the nine Black Riders or Ringwraiths. 

Scholars have commented that Tolkien saw community as the right way to live. They note, too, that the Company is diverse both in culture and in personal qualities, and bound together by friendship, a model very different from the western image of the lone hero. Tolkien uses the term &quot;company&quot; far more often than &quot;fellowship&quot;, the word coming from Latin &quot;companio&quot;, a person who shares bread, suggesting a co-traveller on the road or a group with a shared purpose. The Company of the Ring has been likened to the Arthurian order of the Knights of the Round Table, a group that has many points of similarity including a person carrying the burden of a quest, a returning King, an accompanying Wizard, and a treacherous knight.

== Context ==

J. R. R. Tolkien (1892â1973) was an English Roman Catholic writer, poet, philologist, and academic, best known as the author of the high fantasy works &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, published in 1937, and its sequel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, published in 1954â55. Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.

== Narrative ==

The main plot of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is a quest to destroy the One Ring, to prevent it from falling into the hands of its creator, the dark lord Sauron. A council is held in Rivendell to decide how to achieve this. A hobbit, Frodo Baggins, is to bear the Ring to the land of Mordor to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom. He is to be assisted by a Company representing the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Elrond announces that

The Company sets out on the quest at the beginning of winter. It is led by the Wizard Gandalf; he takes the company south through the wild lands of Eriador. They attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, but are driven back. Instead, they travel through the mines of Moria. Gandalf falls while fighting a Balrog there, allowing the others to escape. Aragorn leads the Fellowship to LothlÃ³rien, and then in boats down the River Anduin.

After some days on the river, the Company camp at Parth Galen to decide what to do. The next day, the Company is broken. While the others argue about the route to take, Frodo slips away and Boromir follows him. Boromir demands the Ring from Frodo. To escape, Frodo puts on the Ring, making himself invisible. 
Merry and Pippin are captured by a group of Orcs. Boromir is killed defending them. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli give Boromir&#x27;s body a boat burial; they then set off in pursuit of Merry and Pippin. Sam catches up with Frodo as he, still invisible, sets out to cross the river in one of the boats; the two of them set out together to Mordor. Frodo and Sam manage, after many hardships, to reach Mount Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and Sauron is utterly vanquished. The Company of the Ring is victorious.

== Analysis ==

=== Theme of community ===

The Inklings scholar Ariel Little writes that Tolkien saw community as the &quot;ideal model for life&quot;. This desired type of community, as seen in the Company of the Ring, is specifically diverse, in culture and in personal qualities, a team bound together by friendship and relying completely on the strengths of each individual member to forward the common cause. This is the reverse of the character of what Tolkien states is the evil assemblage that opposes the Company, who are &quot;homogeneous, discordant, and intensely individualistic.&quot; Little comments that the model of community is radically unlike the western image of the lone hero. The Christian theologian Ralph C. Wood writes that &quot;the greatness of the Nine Walkers lies in the modesty of both their abilities and accomplishments. Their strength lies in their weakness, in their solidarity as a company unwilling to wield controlling power over others.&quot; Rebecca Munro notes that in the Company, &quot;no one acts alone without dependence on the deeds of others&quot;. Little adds that even when the Company is split into smaller groups, it is not destroyed; the three smaller groupsâFrodo and Sam on the way to Mordor; Merry and Pippin supporting each other; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli acting as a teamâcontinue to function as communities.

Martina JuriÄkovÃ¡ writes in &quot;Mallorn&quot; that Tolkien uses the term &quot;company&quot; far more often than &quot;fellowship&quot; to describe the group: &quot;company&quot; appears more than 130 times, against just 9 for &quot;fellowship&quot;. She notes that Tolkien was a philologist, fully aware of the etymologies of these terms, and the resulting slight differences in their meanings. &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;companion&quot; are from the Latin &quot;companio&quot;, in turn from &quot;con&quot; (&quot;with&quot;) and &quot;panis&quot; (&quot;bread&quot;), hence &quot;person who shares bread [with you]&quot;, such as a co-traveller or a member of a group with a shared purpose. &quot;Fellow&quot;, on the other hand, derives from Old English &quot;feolaga&quot;, &quot;a fee-layer&quot;, a person who joins in a financial venture. JuriÄkovÃ¡ comments that this could mean an equal, &quot;a peer with whom I have something in common&quot;; but that in modern English it can equally well mean someone &quot;of lower rank or considered to be of little importance or worth&quot; (as in &quot;that fellow over there&quot;). That would explain, she suggests, why Tolkien could use &quot;fellowship&quot; with its positive connotations, while avoiding the loosely-used word &quot;fellow&quot;.

=== Arthurian origins ===

Tolkien scholars note that while Tolkien criticised the mythology of King Arthur, and disliked its explicit mentions of Christian themes, there are multiple parallels in his writings, not least of Aragorn to King Arthur, suggesting that Tolkien certainly made use of the mythology. Laura GÃ¡lvez-GÃ³mez specifically likens the Company of the Ring to the Arthurian order of the Knights of the Round Table. In both, there is &quot;a chosen hero who carries the main burden&quot; on a quest, a returning King with the gift of healing, an accompanying Wizard, a treacherous knight, and &quot;a hero without courtly manners who finally becomes a knight&quot;.&#x27;

== In adaptations ==

All the members of the Company of the Ring are portrayed in Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. According to Rotten Tomatoes, a consensus of film critics described the casting as &quot;pitch-perfect&quot;. The Company was played by the following actors:

* Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins
* Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey
* Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn
* Sean Bean as Boromir
* Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee
* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck
* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli
* Orlando Bloom as Legolas
* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took

Tolkien scholars were divided about Jackson&#x27;s film representation of Tolkien&#x27;s novel, but even scholars generally hostile to the film version have respected its visual presentation, admiring the casting, costumes, props, and cinematography. The diminutive scale of the four hobbits, and of the dwarf Gimli, was achieved by the use of several methods, including scale doubles of film sets, forced perspective, and green-screening to combine reduced images of hobbits and dwarf with unscaled images of the other members of the Company. To make the dwarf appear slightly taller than the hobbits without requiring additional scale doubles, a tall actor was chosen to play the dwarf.

<text>Eric Boswell Wynalda (born June 9, 1969) is an American soccer coach, television commentator, and former player. He was formerly an analyst and color commentator for soccer coverage on Fox Sports 1 and ESPN. Previously, he served as head coach and technical director of Las Vegas Lights FC in the USL Championship and he is the host of &quot;WTF: Wynalda Talks Football&quot; on SiriusXM FC.

Wynalda was one of the first Americans to play professionally in Europe before returning to his home country in 1996 to play in Major League Soccer and scoring the first goal in the league&#x27;s history. Until 2008, he was the all-time leading goal scorer for the United States national team. Wynalda was described as a &quot;shifty, dynamic player off the dribble with a heavy shot.&quot; He was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Youth and college==
Wynalda, of Dutch ancestry, grew up in Westlake Village, California. As a child his team the Westlake Wolves, with Eric&#x27;s father Dave as the head coach, won the state championship in AYSO soccer. That year Wynalda scored more goals than the entire division his team played in combined (58 goals in 16 games). His skills continued to improve year after year and he attended Westlake High School and was a three time All State selection with the school&#x27;s boys soccer team and a youth club teammate of fellow national team player Cobi Jones.

Wynalda attended San Diego State University from 1987 to 1989 where he played for the Aztecs men&#x27;s soccer team, scoring 34 goals and assisting on 25 others during his three seasons. His freshman year, SDSU went to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship game where it lost to the Bruce Murray-led Clemson Tigers. While at SDSU, he also played two seasons with the local semi-pro San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer Alliance. In 1988, he played a single game and in 1989, he played five games with the Nomads.

==Club career==
Leading up to the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Wynalda signed a contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF). After the World Cup, Wynalda signed as an on loan player from USSF with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the American Professional Soccer League. During his nearly three seasons with the Blackhawks, he played only a handful of games with the team, devoting most of his time to the national team.

In August 1992, USSF loaned Wynalda to Bundesliga club 1. FC SaarbrÃ¼cken for $45,000. When he arrived at SaarbrÃ¼cken, he became the first American-born player to play for a top level German club. He had an immediate impact, scoring eight goals in the first half of the season where he played all 17 matches. This led SaarbrÃ¼cken to purchase Wynalda&#x27;s contract from USSF for $405,000. In the second half of the season he added one more goal in 15 matches to that tally. By the end of the season SaarbrÃ¼cken was last in the league and became relegated. Wynalda scored 14 goals and had 25 assists in the 1993â94 season of the 2. Bundesliga. After the end of the season he was transferred for $850,000 to second division winners VfL Bochum which as such were promoted to the Bundesliga. There Wynalda remained without goal in his 22 matches of the 1994â95 season and Bochum was relegated. A hernia operation on August 30 limited his tally in the ensuing 2. Bundesliga season to seven matches mid-season â none of those for the full 90 minutes â where he scored two goals. Bochum, after finishing the league first, was promoted again.

Wynalda returned to the States in 1996, signing with Major League Soccer (MLS). As part of the process of creating the new league, known players were distributed throughout the league&#x27;s new teams (except for the Dallas Burn, which alone amongst all MLS sides never received a United States national team allocation from the 1994 World Cup era). The league allocated Wynalda to the San Jose Clash. On April 6, 1996, Wynalda scored the first goal in league history in its inaugural game as the Clash beat D.C. United 1â0. He was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year for 1996.

Wynalda was loaned out to Club LeÃ³n in Mexico in 1999. He tore both the ACL and medial meniscus on his left knee while with Leon, which put him out of action for several months.

=== New England Revolution ===

After missing the first eleven games of the 1999 season, the Clash traded Wynalda to the Miami Fusion on June 1, 1999. On July 7, 2000, the Fusion turned around and traded Wynalda to the New England Revolution along with future draft considerations for defender Ivan McKinley. On August 12, 2000, Wynalda made his first appearance for the Revolution, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute for Imad Baba in the Revolution&#x27;s loss to the MetroStars. He recorded his first assist for the club a week later in the Revolution&#x27;s 2-1 home win over the Tampa Bay Mutiny. His first start came on September 3 in the Revolution&#x27;s 2-0 loss to D.C. United. On September 19, 2000, in the MLS Cup Playoff Quarterfinals, Wynalda scored his first goal for the Revolution, the opener in their 2-1 victory over the Chicago Fire. It was the club&#x27;s first-ever playoff win (the Revolution were subsequently eliminated from the series, losing 2 games to 1 in the best-of-three tie).

=== Chicago Fire ===

In February 2001, the Revolution re-signed Wynalda, but would deal him to the Chicago Fire on May 3, 2001 for John Wolyniec and a third-round pick in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Despite the season being underway when he arrived, Wynalda would end up as the Fire&#x27;s leading scorer for 2001, recording 10 goals and 5 assists in MLS Play. The Fire waived Wynalda on January 15, 2002.

=== Later career ===

In 2002, Wynalda attempted to join the Los Angeles Galaxy, announcing that he planned to retire with the team. However, the negotiations with the Galaxy did not work out and he signed for the Charleston Battery of the USL First Division. Wynalda joined the team only to tear his anterior cruciate ligament in a pre-season match. He elected to retire from professional soccer and became a broadcast announcer.

==International career==
Wynalda earned his first cap with the United States national team against Costa Rica on February 2, 1990. On March 14, 1990, he signed a contract with the United States Soccer Federation which made him a full-time national team player. Later that year, Wynalda played in the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, his first World Cup, earning a red card against Czechoslovakia, for retaliating against midfielder Lubomir Moracik, who had backed into Wynalda during a dead ball play throw in, pushing Moracik to the ground from behind in front of the referee, lineman, field judge and both teams benches (erupting the Czech bench), becoming the first U.S. player to be ejected from a World Cup match. The Czech player&#x27;s treatment of Wynalda was in retaliation for a wildly thrown elbow on another teammate in the first half. Wynalda was lucky not to have been red carded then only to be ejected in the 53 minute leaving his side a man down for the remaining 37 minutes of the second half.

Wynalda was a part of the United States squad that won the 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup. In the final the US beat Honduras 4â3 on penalties after a 0â0 stalemate after extra time led the game to penalties. Wynalda started every game of the tournament for the United States and scored the third goal for the US in their second group stage match against Guatemala, which the US won 3â0.

In the 1994 World Cup, Wynalda scored on a free kick from 28 yards as the United States tied Switzerland. He also played in Copa America 1995, where he scored against Chile and Argentina.

In 1998, Wynalda participated in his third World Cup, one of only three United States players (the others being Tab Ramos and Marcelo Balboa) to have earned that honor at that time. He finished the 1998 World Cup with no goals.

In 2000, Wynalda retired from the United States national team as its all-time leading scorer with 34 goals in 106 appearances. He was the sole owner of the record until 2007, when Landon Donovan tied the record with a penalty kick goal against Mexico in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final. Wynalda lost the record when Donovan scored yet another penalty kick in a friendly match against Sweden on January 19, 2008.

Wynalda was named the Honda U.S. Player of the Decade for the 1990s, was named to the CONCACAF All-Decade Team of the 1990s and was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2006, he was named to the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
In 2005, Bakersfield Brigade of the USL Premier Development League hired Wynalda as its technical director, and in 2007 he agreed to a short-term playing contract with the team during the last few matches of their season. On May 1, 2008, he signed a formal season-long agreement to play the entire campaign with the Brigade as a full member of the 2008 playing squad.

He has also continued to play with an over-30s amateur team in Los Angeles, Hollywood United, alongside former U.S. internationals Alexi Lalas and John Harkes, former French international Frank Leboeuf, former Welsh international player Vinnie Jones, and actor Anthony La Paglia. United plays in the Los Angeles Olympic Soccer League.

===Cal FC===
Wynalda has been the head coach of Cal FC since 2012 and his side received attention in the 2012 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup when they reached the fourth round of the tournament, upsetting USL Pro side Wilmington Hammerheads 4â0 and Major League Soccer side Portland Timbers 1â0 along the way.

Cal FC&#x27;s victory over the Timbers made them the second-ever USASA side to beat an MLS side (the first being Dallas Roma FC beating Chivas USA in 2006), as well as the first amateur side to beat an MLS one without needing penalty kicks. It stands as the biggest upset in the tournament&#x27;s history, especially considering the Timbers featured their regular starting lineup.

===Atlanta Silverbacks===
On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Wynalda would become the interim head coach and team adviser of the new North American Soccer League&#x27;s Atlanta Silverbacks.

On January 7, 2014, the Silverbacks announced they would get rid of the head coach position and have Wynalda act as the manager and technical director of the team. This is something rarely done by a professional soccer club.

===Las Vegas Lights FC===
On October 17, 2018, Las Vegas Lights FC of the USL announced that Wynalda would be their new Head Coach and Technical Director.

===New Amsterdam FC===
On July 30, 2020, New Amsterdam FC of the National Independent Soccer Association announced Wynalda has the team&#x27;s first head coach. On August 17, following two preseason tournament matches and five days prior to the start of the fall season, Wynalda announced his departure for personal reasons.

==Broadcast career==
After retiring, Wynalda began working as a soccer analyst for ESPN. Along with Alexi Lalas, he was the channel&#x27;s in-studio analyst for the 2006 FIFA World Cup on English-language broadcasts. Wynalda was one of the most vocal critics of U.S. head coach Bruce Arena during the tournament. However, after the World Cup, he was amicably paired in-studio with Arena as co-analysts for some 2006 MLS Cup playoff games, a successful arrangement which continued with ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the US National Team in 2007. Wynalda was one of the main analysts for ESPN and ABC during the 2007 Major League Soccer season.

In 2008, he became columnist for &quot;Major League Soccer Magazine&quot;, an independent soccer magazine licensed with MLS and based in Los Angeles.

In August 2009, Fox Soccer Channel announced that Eric Wynalda would replace Steven Cohen as the co-host of the weekly discussion show, Fox Football Fone-in and partner up with Nick Webster who coached alongside Eric with Cal FC during their historic run in the U.S. Open Cup. In addition, Wynalda began working as a commentator for some of the channel&#x27;s MLS broadcasts, and as an in-studio analyst during pre-game, half-time, and post-game segments for the UEFA Champions League.

In June &amp; July 2010, Wynalda covered the 2010 FIFA World Cup for Yahoo! Sports as a video blog analyst.

He is currently an analyst for Fox Sports 1, covering Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League, and FA Cup.

In October 2015, Wynalda joined SiriusXM FC 85 as the host of the new program &quot;WTF: Wynalda Talks Football&quot;. Joined by the &#x27;Stat Man&#x27; David Mosse, Eric covers the world of soccer, pop culture, and everything in between. The show airs Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7pm-9pm Eastern on SiriusXM FC 85.

== Personal life ==
Wynalda married Amanda Fletcher in 2014. They live in Thousand Oaks, CA with their three children and his three children from a previous marriage.

Wynalda&#x27;s house in the Westlake Village neighborhood was destroyed in the November 2018 Woolsey Fire. Wynalda and his family had evacuated to relatives in Corona, California, where he watched footage of the fire on television. Of the 162 houses in Wynalda&#x27;s Westlake Village tract, his home was the only one that burned.

<text>Beaumont is a lava-flooded crater located on the southwestern shore of the Mare Nectaris on Earth&#x27;s Moon. It lies to the northwest of the similarly flooded crater remnant Fracastorius. To the west is the prominent crater Catharina. The crater is named after French geologist LÃ©once Ãlie de Beaumont.

The rim of Beaumont is breached in the east, where the lava from Mare Nectaris broached the crater and flooded the interior. Now only a worn and crater-impacted outer wall remains. If the crater once possessed a central peak, it is no longer apparent. The floor contains several hills and small craters. A low ridge runs northward from the crater rim across the Mare Nectaris.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Beaumont.

<text>Z-Stoff (, &quot;substance Z&quot;) was a name for calcium permanganate or sodium permanganate mixed in water. It was normally used as a catalyst for T-Stoff (high-test peroxide) in military rocket programs by Nazi Germany during World War II.

Z-Stoff was used in the cold engine of the Messerschmitt Me 163 A airplane, in the earlier, self-contained HWK 109-500 &quot;Starthilfe&quot; RATO booster motor for crewed aircraft (usually in pairs or multiples of two for such uses), and a smaller derivation of the &quot;Starthilfe&quot; unit, the HWK 109-507 booster engine used with the Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship guided missile. T-Stoff decomposed by Z-Stoff was commonly used by World War II German military to generate steam for powering of fuel pumps in airplanes and rockets.

The reaction produces manganese dioxide, which tends to clog the steam generators. Later generations of the Walter Rocket used solid-state catalyst instead of its water solution.

<text>The Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts of the Federation(&quot;Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten GerichtshÃ¶fe des Bundes (GmS-OGB)&quot;, also called the Joint Senate) is an institution established to ensure the uniformity of the case law of the Federal Supreme Courts of the Federal Republic of Germany. The legal basis for its establishment is Article 95 (3) of the Basic Law in the version based on the Sixteenth Act Amending the Basic Law of 22 June 1968. Prior to this amendment, Article 95 of the Basic Law had provided for the establishment of a , but this never came about. 

The Joint Senate is composed of the Presidents of the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Administrative Court, the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court and the Federal Fiscal Court, who are supplemented, depending on the case, by the chairmen and one other judge from each of the Senates involved.

The Joint Senate gathers rarely (between 2000 and 2010, there were only three decisions), as the areas of responsibility of the branches of justice in Germany are in general well-defined and so most of its rulings are on definitory matters. Its meetings are organised by the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe. 

The Joint Senate (&quot;Gemeinsamer Senat&quot;) should not be confused with the (&quot;GroÃer Senat&quot;) that exists within each Federal Supreme Court. Its function is similar to that of the Joint Senate, as it mediates between the several Senates of a Supreme Court in cases of dissent.

<doc id="926160" wikidata="Q1361101" url="?curid=926160" title="Rugby union in Wales">
<text>Rugby union in Wales () is considered a large part of Welsh national culture. Rugby union is thought to have reached Wales in the 1850s, with the national body, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) being formed in 1881. Wales are considered to be one of the most successful national sides in Rugby Union, having won the most Six Nations Championships after England, as well as having reached 3 World Cup semi finals in 1987, 2011 and 2019, having finished 3rd in the inaugural competition and having finished 4th in 2011 in a repeat of the first third place play-off. The Welsh team of the 1970s is considered to be one of the greatest national teams of all time. As of February 2025, they are ranked 12th in the world.

The Wales national team play at the WRU-owned Principality Stadium, and compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, as well as having competed at every Rugby World Cup. Wales are ranked as a tier-1 nation by World Rugby. Wales also competes as one of the 15 &quot;core teams&quot; in the annual World Rugby Sevens Series, and won the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens.

The main domestic competition in Wales is the United Rugby Championship (formerly called Pro 14, and before that the Celtic League). Four regional sides (Ospreys, Cardiff, Scarlets, and Dragons) represent Wales in the competition, which also includes sides from Ireland, Scotland, Italy, and South Africa. The regional sides also compete in the Europe-wide European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup.

Beneath the URC, club rugby is represented by over 200 WRU affiliated clubs who play in the Welsh Premier Division and the lower Welsh Divisional leagues. Prominent clubs include Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, Llanelli, Bridgend, Neath, Pontypool, Pontypridd, and England-based London Welsh.

As of February 2019 the Welsh Rugby Union are reviewing the number of regions, with potential consolidation for funding two or three super teams.

==History==
===The growth of rugby in Wales 1850-1900===

Rugby-like games have a long history in Wales, with games such as cnapan being played for centuries. Rugby seems to have reached Wales in 1850, when the Reverend Professor Rowland Williams brought the game with him from Cambridge to St. David&#x27;s College, Lampeter, which fielded the first Welsh rugby team that same year.

Rugby initially expanded in Wales through ex-pupils of the Welsh colleges settling, or students from English colleges and universities returning to the larger industrial hubs of South Wales. This is reflected in the first clubs to embrace the sport in the early to mid-1870s, with Neath RFC widely recognised as the first Welsh club. The strength of Welsh rugby developed over the following years, which could be attributed to the &#x27;big four&#x27; South Wales clubs of Newport (who lost only seven games under the captaincy of Llewellyn Lloyd between the 1900/01 and 1902/03 seasons), Cardiff, Llanelli (who lost just twice in 1894 and 1895) and Swansea. With the coming of industrialisation and the railways, rugby too was spread as workers from the main cities brought the game to the new steel and coal towns of south Wales. Merthyr formed in 1876, Brecon in 1874, Penygraig in 1877; as the towns adopted the new sport they reflected the growth and expansion of a new industrial Wales.

In the 19th century as well as the established clubs there were many &#x27;scratch&#x27; teams populating most towns, informal pub or social teams that would form and disband quickly. Llanelli, as an example, in the 1880s was home not only to Llanelli RFC, but also to Gower Road, Seasiders, Morfa Rangers, Prospect Place Rovers, Wern Foundry, Cooper Mills Rangers, New Dock Strollers, Vauxhall Juniors, Moonlight Rovers and Gilbert Street Rovers. These teams would come and go, but some would merge into more settled clubs which exist today, Cardiff RFC was itself formed from three teams, Glamorgan, Tredegarville and Wanderers Football Clubs.

The South Wales Football Club was established in 1875 to try to incorporate a standard set of rules and expand the sport and this was succeeded by the Welsh Football Union which was formed in 1881. With the forming of the WFU (which would become the Welsh Rugby Union in 1934), Wales began competing in recognised international matches, with the first game, against England, also in 1881. The first Welsh team although fairly diverse in the geography of the clubs represented, did not appear to truly represent the strength available to Wales. The team was mainly made up of ex-Cambridge and Oxford university graduates and the selection was heavily criticised in the local press after the crushing defeat by England.

By the end of the 19th century, a group of exciting Welsh players began to emerge, including Arthur Gould, Billy Bancroft and Gwyn Nicholls; players that would be regarded as the first super-stars of Welsh rugby and would usher in not only the first golden era of Welsh rugby, but would also see the introduction of specialised positional players.

===The first golden era 1900-1919===

The first &#x27;Golden Era&#x27; of Welsh rugby is so called due to the success achieved by the national team during the early 20th century. Wales had already won the Triple Crown in 1893, but between 1900 and 1914 the team would win the trophy on six occasions, and with France joining the tournament (unofficially in 1908 and 1909) three Grand Slams.

With the introduction of specialised players like hooker George Travers, the WFU could no longer choose the &#x27;best players&#x27; to represent Wales, they needed to think tactically and choose people who could do a specific job on the pitch. This period of Welsh rugby would see the grip of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; clubs providing the bulk of national players, slip slightly. The WFU still tended to turn to the likes of Swansea and Newport to supply the skillful back players and usually kept club half-back pairings together such as Jones and Owen of Swansea. But it was the introduction of the &#x27;Rhondda Forward&#x27; which saw men who worked day in day out in the coal, iron and tin mines enter the Welsh front row. Chosen for their strength and aggressive tackling, players such as Dai &#x27;Tarw&#x27; Jones from Treherbert and Dai Evans from Penygraig added muscle to the front row.

Although a progressive time for international rugby, this period initially saw regression for many of the club sides in the form of the temperance movement. In the early 1900s, rugby was seen as a wicked temptation to the young men of the mining and steel communities, leading to violence and drink, and the valley areas in particular were part of a strong Nonconformist Baptist movement. The religious revival saw some communities completely reject rugby and local clubs, like Senghenydd, disbanded for several years. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1910s that the social view of rugby would change the other way, fostered by mine owners as a great social unifier; and like baseball in America would be portrayed as a &#x27;...source of community integration because it installed civic pride&#x27;.

Unlike the game in England, rugby union in Wales was never seen as a sport for gentlemen of higher learning. Although this was fostered in the first international Welsh team, the fast absorption of the sport into the working class areas appeared to sever the link of rugby as a sport for the middle and upper classes.

As rugby became linked with the hard working men of the industrialised areas of Wales, it should also be noted that the sport did not escape the hardships of the industries. In 1913 five members of the Senghenydd team were killed in Britain&#x27;s worst colliery disaster and many more lost their lives in the &#x27;slow drip&#x27; of deaths caused by the industries. Far worse was to follow during the conflict of World War I when many teams lost members, including Welsh internationals like Charlie Pritchard and Johnny Williams.

===Post-war Welsh rugby 1920-1930===

The 1920s were a difficult time for Welsh rugby. The first golden period was over and the players that made up the teams that won four Triple Crowns had already disbanded before the Great War. The war could not be blamed for the downturn in Welsh fortunes as all the home nations lost their young talent in equal numbers. The fact that so many of Wales&#x27; talented stars had retired from rugby before 1910 was felt when Wales failed to win the tournament in the few years leading up to the war. But the main reason for Welsh failure on the rugby pitch can be mapped to an economic failures of Wales as a country. The First World War had created an unrealistic demand for coal, and in the 1920s the collapse in the need for coal resulted in a massive level of unemployment throughout the south Wales valleys. This in turn led to mass emigration as people left Wales for work. The knock-on effect was felt in the port cities of Newport and Cardiff, that relied on the transportation of coal.

Suddenly the call of the professional league was a very strong draw to men who could not claim money for playing union. Between 1919 and 1939, Forty-eight capped Welsh rugby union players joined league rugby. The fact that the equivalent of three full national squads left the sport can only allude to the number of trialists and club members that also left the sport. Exceptional players lost to the league game included Jim Sullivan of Cardiff, William Absalom of Abercarn and Emlyn Jenkins of Treorchy.

The other side of the depression was linked to those people that stayed behind. In homes where men were the only earners, the decline in heavy labour areas resulted in very stark choices in where the household money could be spent. It was difficult to justify paying to watch rugby when there was little money for food and rent. With crowds dwindling clubs were forced to drastic measures in the hope of survival. Loughor which had produced five internationals in the 1920s were by 1929 begging door to door for old kit. Haverfordwest disbanded from 1926â29, Pembroke Dock Quins were reduced to 5 members by 1927 and in the valleys the Treherbert, Llwynypia and Nantyffyllon clubs had vanished before 1930. Even clubs of the size of Pontypool were not spared; in 1927 they were playing and beating the Waratahs and the Maoris, by 1930 they were Â£2,000 in debt and facing bankruptcy.

Another reason for the fall in the Welsh union game can be placed on the improvement of football in Wales. Traditionally seen as a game more associated with North Wales, the success of Cardiff Football Club in the 1920s was a strong draw for many supporters. With two F.A. Cup Finals in 1925 and 1927, Cardiff were making the once unpopular sport of &#x27;soccer&#x27; very fashionable, for fans and sportsmen alike.

During the 1920s the one team that appeared to be unaffected by the double threat of soccer and debt was Llanelli. The Scarlets had an unswerving loyalty shown by their home supporters, who were repaid by exciting, high scoring matches. During the 1925/26 season the club were unbeaten and the next season they had achieved the feat of defeating Cardiff on four occasions. This success would later be reflected in the growing number of Llanelli players that would represent their country in the 1920s, including Albert Jenkins, Ivor Jones and Archie Skym.

Apart from a few sporadic victories from the national team, there appeared little to cheer about in the 1920s for Welsh rugby at club or country level; but the seeds of recovery were being planted during the same decade. On June 9, 1923 the Welsh Secondary Schools Rugby Union was established in Cardiff. Founded by Dr R Chalke, head of Porth Secondary School with WRU members Horace Lyne as president and Eric Evans as secretary. Its aim was to promote rugby at school level in an attempt to regain &#x27;the glorious days of Gwyn Nicholls, Willie Llewellyn and Dr E.T. Morgan&#x27;. In April 1923, at the Arms Park, Wales played their first secondary schools fixture led by future international Watcyn Thomas, who would progress to captain the first Welsh University XV in 1926. Over the coming years, schools such as Cardiff High School, Llanelli County School, Llandovery and Christ College, Brecon fostered a generation of players which would fill the Welsh ranks over the coming years. Wales had in effect begun to mimic the systems adopted by England and Scotland, that rugby should be nurtured from youth, through adolescence to adulthood.

The 1920s closed with the formation of the West Wales Rugby Union, an event that initially appeared to be a positive indication of growth, but in fact the union was formed by western clubs to wrest control away from the WRU. The West Wales clubs had become disenchanted in decisions made by their parent body and believed the Union had no interest in the lower tier clubs, allowing them to become mere feeders for the bigger clubs.

===The Welsh revival 1930-1939===
The 1930s began on a high for Welsh international rugby, with success in the Home Nations Championship and the emergence of a strong Welsh team. In the 1931 Championship Wales beat Ireland at Ravenhill in a bruising affair that not only gave Wales the title but denied Ireland the Triple Crown. This may have signaled a change in fortunes in Welsh rugby but underneath the same problems that dogged Wales throughout the 1920s still remained. Wales was still suffering the effects of the depression and club rugby was struggling to survive. Even the WRU had problems, as it faced the fact that it was the only home union without their own ground. The Cardiff Arms was leased and St Helens was on loan.

From what at first appears to be yet another decade of turmoil for Welsh rugby, is actually regarded as a period of revival. The economic situation began turning from 1937, the WSSRU was bringing many exciting backs through the school system, North Wales embraced the game and the national team won two morale lifting games against England in 1933 and the All Blacks in 1935.

From a statistical point of view, the Welsh national team appeared to be winning roughly the same number of games throughout the 1930s as the poor 1920s period, but Wales were actually improving. In the 1920s most Welsh victories were against France, then the weakest team in the Five Nations Championship; but in 1931 France were excluded from the tournament over accusations of professionalism at club level and were not readmitted until after the 1939 tournament, just before international rugby was suspended because of the Second World War. Welsh victories were now coming against the more established home nation teams. During this period, Wales won three Championships, but its greatest victory happened during the 1933 tournament when they finished last. Since its first international game in 1910, Wales had failed to beat England at Twickenham in nine attempts. Now dubbed the &#x27;Twickenham bogey&#x27;, it took the self confidence of Cardiff&#x27;s Ronnie Boon to break the losing streak as he scored a try and a drop goal to take the match 7-3. The game also saw the debut of two players who would become Welsh greats, Wilf Wooller and Vivian Jenkins.

Wales played host to two touring Southern Hemisphere teams in the 1930s, first came Bennie Osler&#x27;s South Africa followed by Jack Manchester&#x27;s All Blacks. The South Africans were rampant in Wales, winning the test match and all six club matches, though gained few supporters due to the kicking tactics Osler employed. The New Zealander&#x27;s received a better welcome, and after the previous tour where the tourist went unbeaten the Welsh press were hoping for a return of the spirit that won the first encounter in 1905. Before the match with Wales, New Zealand were to face eight club teams over six games. After winning the opening three English county matches and then beating a joint Abertillery and Cross Keys the All Blacks were showing the same form shown in their first two tours, but then stumbled against Swansea. Swansea were not in a period of particular growth and the only two players showing any flair were Wales Schoolboy players Willie Davies and Haydn Tanner. During the game Merv Corner could not contain the attacking bursts from Tanner, the New Zealand flankers were drawn in which in turned allowed Davies the freedom to run which Claude Davey finished off with two tries. Jack Manchester&#x27;s response to the Swansea win was to ask the New Zealand press &quot;Tell them we have been beaten, but don&#x27;t tell them it was by a pair of schoolboys&quot;. This win gave Swansea the honour of being the first club team to have beaten all three major Southern Hemisphere touring teams. The All Blacks were unbeaten in the next twenty matches, but lost to Wales in a classic game which Wales managed to win in the last ten minutes of the game after the Welsh hooker, Don Tarr, was stretchered off with a broken neck.

===Post-war Welsh rugby 1945-1959===
The post-war years saw strong club teams emerge, but it wasn&#x27;t until the 1950s that a true blend of players could be produced to translate club success into international victories. The coming of television saw an upsurge in popularity for the national team, but a decline in club support. Success was gained in the Five Nations Championship, Wales supplied many players to the ranks of the British Lions and New Zealand was beaten for the last time that century.

The decades following on from the Second World War were a boom time for Welsh rugby, though it took until the 1950s for the benefits to be seen on the playing fields. Although Britain was suffering from a post-war slump, attendance figures at club grounds saw an increase as rugby was again embraced as a spectator sport. Towns and villages which had seen their club disbanded during wartime saw their teams re-established. The WRU had 104 member clubs during the 1946-47 season; by the mid fifties there were 130, even though the Union had done nothing to relax its strict membership regulations.

By the 1950s Britain and Wales were beginning to benefit from improved economic conditions. This saw growth in consumer power and spending, which drew many people away from traditional spectator past times, such as sport and the cinema. With a newfound wealth the populace began switching from social pursuits to home entertainment, with the biggest draw being the availability of television. From the mid-fifties there was a significant drop in gate receipts as television became more and more popular. During the 1955 Five Nations Championship, the Scotland v. Wales match was televised live; at the same time an Aberavon v. Abertillery game which would normally draw a crowd of 4000 was unable to muster 400. This created a situation whereby rugby in Wales was gaining in popularity due to the number of people who could now watch the international matches, but support at club level declined. This forced club committees to adopt different strategies to keep their clubs afloat. Many teams set up &#x27;coupon funds&#x27; to allow clothing rations to be contributed by members to buy kit. With careful management and thrift most clubs not only survived but grew. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, with little money, many clubs were able to build new facilities or even own their grounds and club-houses for the first time in their history. In 1951 Glamorgan Wanderers purchased the Memorial Grounds in Ely and in 1952 Llanelli were able to purchase the rugby portion of Stradey Park. Similarly, 1954 saw Blaina construct a new stand while Llanharan were able to build their first changing rooms procured from RAF surplus units. These events were typical of club expansion through the 50s. It was around this time that club social activities were extended including the introduction of ladiesâ committees.

Clubs also took matters into their own hands to promote themselves and their sport. 1947 saw the first unofficial club championship, won by Neath in its inaugural year, but dominated by Cardiff and Ebbw Vale until the 1960/61 season. In 1954 Welsh rugby sevens had their own tournament with the introduction of the Snelling Sevens competition, while Glamorgan County RFC introduced the Silver Ball Trophy in 1956 for the promotion of second tier clubs in the region.

The national team, after unconvincing displays during the 1940s, found unexpected success in the early 1950s winning the Grand Slam twice; in 1950 and 1952. The 1950 win came after a disastrous 1949 campaign, which saw Wales collect the wooden spoon; but after an opening win over England, the team finished the last three matches conceding only three points. The tournament saw the emergence of Welsh record-breaking player Ken Jones as a world class wing; who is most remembered for his late try against the 1953 touring New Zealand team. The 1950 championship is also remembered for the tragic events following the away win over Ireland, when a chartered flight, returning from the Triple Crown winning match, crashed at Llandow. Seventy five Welsh fans and five crew died in the accident; at the time it was the world&#x27;s worst civil air disaster.

===The second golden era 1969-1979===
The zenith of Welsh rugby was the 1970s, when Wales had players such as Barry John, Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett and JPR Williams. Wales won four consecutive Triple Crowns. 

Gareth Edwards was voted the greatest player of all time in a players poll in 2003 and scored what is widely regarded as the greatest try of all time in 1973 for the Barbarians against New Zealand.

===The start of the professional era: 1980 to 2012===

The 1980s and early &#x27;90s were a difficult time for Welsh rugby union when the team suffered many defeats. Harsh economic times in the eighties meant that players such as Jonathan Davies and Scott Gibbs were tempted to &#x27;go North&#x27; to play professional rugby league in order to earn a living.

In 2003/4 the Welsh Rugby Union voted to create five regions to play in the Celtic League (now the United Rugby Championship) and represent Wales in European competition. This soon became four when the Celtic Warriors were liquidated after just one season. The WRU have announced their hopes of developing a fifth region in North Wales in the long run; the team at the centre of this plan is now known as RGC 1404.

In recent years, Welsh Premier Division and Welsh Championship club rugby has faced increased financial hardship, with historic clubs at threat. Premiership side Neath RFC had received a now-resolved winding up petition from HM Revenue and Customs, while Championship team Pontypool RFC have had to fund-raise from supporters to remain at their ground.

=== Regional Rugby and future reforms: 2013 to present ===

Created by David Moffat in 2003, Welsh rugby follows a region system with a top tier composed of four club regions. This arrangement has however faced a number of funding issues in recent years. The regions currently operate on a 2009 Participation Agreement which expires in 2019.

The regions in 2013 protested against a new agreement, as they felt it did not offer any funding commitments or clarity regarding competitions such as the Heineken Cup. The Union retorted that funding would increase, but that regions would need to commit to the framework or risk losing their revenue streams.

==== Project Reset ====

In 2018 the WRU launched Project Reset to review regional arrangements. Due to the growing strength of French Top 14 and English Premiership Rugby sides, the WRU have increased salaries to bring Welsh international players such as Taulupe Faletau, Dan Biggar, Ross Moriarty, and Rhys Webb back into the Welsh league system. Yet the Union now feel the salary arrangements are unsustainable.

The WRU has established the Professional Rugby Board to handle the proposed changes, composed of representatives from both the WRU and the regions.

Proposal 1 - Merge Scarlets/Ospreys and Blues/Dragons

Under one proposal, the region system would decrease from four sides to two. Ospreys and the Scarlets would merge, as would Cardiff Blues and Dragons. Such proposals face widespread opposition from sections of supporters whose local loyalties would prevent them from travelling to traditionally &#x27;rival&#x27; grounds to follow their team, standing in the terraces with their bitter rivals. Yet opponents of the proposal have pointed to the struggles of the Scottish rugby union team in test fixtures since switching to a two-region model dominated by Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors.

Proposal 2 - Ending the Dragons franchise, or move it to North Wales

As the poorest performing Welsh region, the WRU have reportedly discussed moving the Dragons to North Wales, or closing it altogether. This would be challenging given the side&#x27;s contractual commitments, and its guarantees to ground share at Rodney Parade with Newport RFC and EFL League Two side Newport County A.F.C. until 2021. The WRU have proposed the resulting space then be filled by a North Wales side taking the place of Conwy-based, semi professional RGC 1404.

In recent years Dragons have improved their attendances however, so such a move is considered highly controversial and financially ineffective. The WRU nonetheless own both the team and the ground, so have strong control over the franchise&#x27;s future. 
A regional rugby franchise, originally known as &quot;Rygbi Gogledd Cymru&quot; (Welsh language for &quot;Rugby North Wales&quot;) and later known as RGC 1404, was established in North Wales; plans called for the side to enter the Welsh Premier Division as early as 2010â11 and eventually the Celtic League/Pro12, but the venture was unsuccessful and was liquidated in 2011. The team, however, continues to play as part of Wales&#x27; national rugby academy. RGC 1404 also had a partnership with Rugby Canada by which the franchise would have a secondary role of developing players for the Canada national rugby union team, at least until enough local players were developed to fill a complete competitive squad.

Proposal 3 - Merging Cardiff Blues and Ospreys

As the most successful side in Pro14 (previously Celtic League) history, Ospreys now face significant issues, with reports of debts and stalled contract negotiations threatening their claim to players such as Alun Wyn Jones and head coach Allen Clarke. Managing director Andrew Millward had described the struggle, involving year long budget cuts and structural flaws in the Welsh rugby system, as leaving Wales unable to compete with rivals IRFU and FRR.

Facing a merger with Cardiff Blues however, Ospreys supporters have pushed back, arguing that the removal of the Ospreys franchise from the Swansea region would leave one of Wales&#x27; rugby heartlands without a local regional side, instead forced to travel to their rivals ground at Cardiff Arms Park.

Blues supporters also point to the fierce battle their side won to remain in their traditional Cardiff RFC colours and name back in 2003, and are unwilling to adopt a new identity.

Proposal 4 - Merge Ospreys and Scarlets

More recent discussions have punted merging western sides Scarlets and Ospreys, with the Llanelli and Swansea teams either sharing grounds or moving fully. Scarlets however opposed such a merger with Ospreys back in 2003, with the late Stuart Gallacher famously opposed to any arrangement which would have ended the Scarlets name.

==Governing body==
The Welsh Rugby Union is the governing body for rugby union in Wales. Their responsibilities include producing the national team and the four regional franchises Cardiff Rugby, Scarlets, Dragons, and Ospreys.

==Competitions==
Wales&#x27; four professional rugby regions play in the United Rugby Championship and take part in the European Rugby Champions Cup, and European Rugby Challenge Cup. The regional sides competed in the Anglo-Welsh Cup, but the sides withdrew after the 2017-18 competition, leaving behind just the English sides. 

The traditional clubs compete in the Welsh Premier Division and WRU Challenge Cup. They had also competed in the semi-professional British and Irish Cup, but this competition was discontinued after the 2018-19 season.

==Popularity==
Rugby union has a particular hold on the national psyche of Wales, especially the Six Nations tournament.

The first proof of Wales as a nation embracing the sport of rugby union is reflected in the rapid growth of rugby clubs in the late 19th century. Within a period of 25 years, from 1875 to 1900, most towns and villages in South Wales were represented by at least one team, though it would take until the 1930s for the North of Wales to set up their own leagues.

Although difficult to prove popularity, two events that took place early in the history of Welsh rugby illustrate its growing influence on the people of Wales. The first was the Gould Affair, when a testimonial fund was set up for Welsh international Arthur Gould, instigated by a local newspaper. From an initial fund of one shilling the public response saw the amount reach into hundreds of pounds, mainly from working-class families with little spare money. The second incident was during the Tonypandy Riot of 1910, when the striking coalminers attacked the shops and premises in the town centre. 80 police officers and 500 civilians were injured and one person died. Over 60 establishments were attacked and looted, with only two buildings avoiding damage. One was a jewelers which had roller shutters, the other was the chemist shop owned by Willie Llewellyn, which despite the chaos of the events was spared due to his services to Wales on the playing field.

For the match against Scotland in 2005, 40,000 Welsh people went to Edinburgh to watch the game. Over 10,000 gathered on &quot;Henson Hill&quot; to watch a big screen of Wales v. Ireland that gave Wales its first Grand Slam since 1978. The result was greeted well amongst fans and was even used to explain a sudden economic surge.

Since 2013, the Millennium Stadium hosts the Judgement Day, a double-header fixture of the four Pro12 teams. The first two editions had over 30,000 spectators. The 2015 edition had 52,762 spectators, the highest in the history of the league.

The choral tradition of Wales manifests itself at rugby games in singing. Popular songs among the fans are &#x27;Delilah&#x27; by Tom Jones, &#x27;Cwm Rhondda&#x27; and &#x27;Calon Lan&#x27; and in part replace the normal chanting of other Rugby supporters.

===Statistics===
According to WR, Wales has 239 rugby union clubs; 2321 referees; 28,702 pre-teen male players; 21,371 teen male players; 19,000 senior male players (total male players 69,073) as well as 1,000 teen female players; 1,056 senior female players (total female players 2,056).

===Demographics===
Whereas rugby in England fractured into the two separate sports of rugby union and rugby league over the issue of money, Wales for the most part stayed loyal to the union game. There were some attempts to run professional rugby league sides in Wales but the heartland of Welsh rugby was simply too far from Yorkshire and Lancashire for this to be sustained.

There has always been an element of nationalism to rugby union in Wales. In 1977 Phil Bennett&#x27;s pre-game pep talk before facing England produced a memorable quote:
Look what these bastards have done to Wales. They&#x27;ve taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our homes and live in them for a fortnight every year. What have they given us? Absolutely nothing. We&#x27;ve been exploited, raped, controlled and punished by the English â and that&#x27;s who you are playing this afternoon.
The Welsh valleys north of Cardiff produced so many quality number tens that it was often referred to as &#x27;The Outside Half Factory&#x27; immortalised in a song by Max Boyce. Boyce&#x27;s humour refers to rugby union very often and he has written many songs about the trials and tribulations of following the game as a fan e.g. &#x27;Asso Asso Yogoshi&#x27;, &#x27;The Scottish Trip&#x27;, &#x27;Hymns and Arias&#x27;.

==The national team==

Wales compete annually in the Six Nations, which they have won 28 times, the last being in 2021. Wales have also appeared in every World Cup that has been held, and achieved their best result in the 1987 tournament, when they finished third. The national team play at the Millennium Stadium, built in 1999 to replace the old National Stadium. Wales play in scarlet jerseys, white shorts and red socks, with the jersey sporting the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers as their official badge. Every four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from Wales as well as England, Ireland and Scotland.

<text>Pepsodent is an American brand of toothpaste with the minty flavor that is derived from sassafras. The brand was purchased by Unilever in 1942 and is still owned by the company outside of the United States and Canada. In 2003, Unilever sold the rights to the brand in the North American market to Church &amp; Dwight.

==History==

Pepsodent toothpaste was introduced in the United States in 1915 by the Pepsodent Company of Chicago. The original formula for the paste contained pepsin, a digestive agent designed to break down and digest food deposits on the teeth, hence the brand and company name.

From 1930 to late 1933 a massive animated neon advertising sign, featuring a young girl on a swing, hung on West 47th Street in Times Square in New York City. This ad was re-created for the climax of the 2005 film &quot;King Kong&quot; and was featured in the original film in an establishing shot of Times Square itself.

Following the acquisition of the Pepsodent Company by Unilever in 1944, sales of Pepsodent in the UK increased rapidly, more than doubling between 1944 and 1950. The company outgrew its original factory in Park Royal, and the manufacture of the product was moved to the factory of another Unilever-owned toiletry manufacturer, Joseph Watson and Sons of Whitehall Road, Leeds, in 1951.

Pepsodent was a very popular brand before the mid-1950s, but its makers were slow to add fluoride to its formula to counter the rise of other highly promoted brands such as Crest and Gleem toothpaste by Procter &amp; Gamble, and Colgate&#x27;s eponymous product; sales of Pepsodent subsequently plummeted. Today Pepsodent is a &quot;value brand&quot; marketed primarily in discount stores and retails for roughly half the price of similarly sized tubes of Crest or of Colgate. Its best-known slogan was, &quot;You&#x27;ll wonder where the yellow went, when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent!&quot;

The product was discontinued in South Africa in 1974 but was revived in 1976 with a new ad slogan &quot;Gets Your Teeth Their Whitest&quot; featuring celebrity endorsers Rita Moreno, Steve Lawrence, and others. The popular slogan was also changed in South Africa to &quot;You&#x27;ll wonder where the dullness went, when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent.&quot;

Pepsodent is still sold as a Unilever property in all markets except the United States and Canada. In Vietnam, Pepsodent is called P/S. In 2013, Pepsodent was ranked 201st among India&#x27;s most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2013 India study, a research conducted by Trust Research Advisory. According to the Brand trust Report 2014, Pepsodent moved up to 71st position among India&#x27;s most trusted brands. Pepsodent&#x27;s parent company Hindustan Unilever was ranked 47th in the Trust Report 2014.

==Advertising==

Pepsodent was advertised for its purported properties for fighting tooth decay, attributed in advertisements to the supposed ingredient &quot;Irium&quot;. In a 1994 speech, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, Reed Hundt, claimed that the &quot;Irium&quot; mentioned in Pepsodent advertisements &quot;didn&#x27;t exist&quot;. &quot;Irium&quot; was being used as another name for sodium lauryl sulfate, an ionic surfactant.

Claude C. Hopkins realized teeth had a yellow film on them and he focused his advertisements for Pepsodent on removing that film. Another ingredient, &quot;IMP&quot;, which stood for &quot;Insoluble Meta-Phosphate&quot;, was claimed to whiten teeth.
===Radio program===
Pepsodent was one of the first consumer products companies to sponsor a radio program. During the thirties and forties, the company sponsored Amos N Andy, and &quot;The Pepsodent Show Starring Bob Hope&quot; that began airing in 1938 and ran for approximately 10 years on NBC. The show featured Bob Hope and his cast of regular characters such as Jerry Colonna, Barbara Jo Allen as Vera Vague, singers including Frances Langford and Doris Day, and bandleader Skinnay Ennis.

Famous Hollywood guest stars such as Cary Grant, Orson Welles, Judy Garland, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, Rita Hayworth, Penny Singleton, Arthur Lake, Basil Rathbone, Gary Cooper, Veronica Lake, Ginger Rogers, Edward G. Robinson, Hedda Hopper, and many more would be on hand to trade comedic barbs with Hope. The show was the first radio program to broadcast live from the Hollywood Canteen on October 13, 1942, and soon the show was playing live to U.S. troops during World War II, even including some of the soldiers in the show.

<text>Szabolcs was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now part of Hungary, except for three villages which are in the Zakarpattia Oblast of Ukraine. The capital of the county was NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za.

==Geography==

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Szabolcs county shared borders with the counties of Borsod, ZemplÃ©n, Ung, Bereg, SzatmÃ¡r, Bihar and HajdÃº. It was situated mostly south of the river Tisza. Its area was around 1910.

Prior to the Hungarian administrative reforms of 1876 Szabolcs controlled some additional territory to the south-west giving it borders with Heves and KÃ¼lsÅ-Szolnok and the NagykunsÃ¡g (part of the JÃ¡szkunsÃ¡g from 1745), as well as a small section of border with BÃ©kÃ©s. This territory largely became part of HajdÃº when it was established in 1876. The (&#x27;HajdÃº district&#x27;, not to be confused with the later HajdÃº county) existed mostly as an enclave of Szabolcs, with some exclaves lying between Szabolcs and Bihar.

In the 1850 reforms which followed the revolutions of 1848 the HajdÃº district was attached to Szabolcs. In the reforms of 1854 Szabolcs lost its western territory, including the HajdÃºkerÃ¼let and the later Dada alsÃ³ district (the salient along the Tisza) to the newly-established North Bihar county. The traditional counties of Hungary were restored in 1860, reversing these changes.

==History==
Szabolcs is one of the oldest counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. In the 17th century, the towns of HajdÃº separated from the county, creating the HajdÃº district. The capital of Szabolcs County was initially Szabolcs (now a village), later NagykÃ¡llÃ³ took over this role (1747-1867), and since 1867 the capital was moved to NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za.

In the 18th and early 19th century Szabolcs was part of the (&#x27;circle/district beyond the Tisza&#x27;), one of four such districts within the Kingdom of Hungary.

From 1850 to 1860 Szabolcs was part of the Military District of GroÃwardein.

After World War I, it was merged with a very small part of the former Ung County to form Szabolcs-Ung county, with NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za as the capital. However, the villages of Eszeny (present-day Esen), SzalÃ³ka (present-day Solovka) and TiszaÃ¡gtelek (present-day Tisaahtelek) in the Tisza district were passed to Czechoslovakia. These villages were returned to Hungary between 1938 and 1945, but were passed to the Soviet Union afterwards (they are part of Ukraine since 1991). In 1950, the county was disestablished and Szabolcs-SzatmÃ¡r County was created, which included most of its territory, while some parts of it were passed to the newly created Borsod-AbaÃºj-ZemplÃ©n and HajdÃº-Bihar counties (area around PolgÃ¡r and north-east of Debrecen). In 1990, Szabolcs-SzatmÃ¡r County was renamed to Szabolcs-SzatmÃ¡r-Bereg County.

==Demographics==

NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za, the capital of Szabolcs County, was founded around 1750 as a Slovak Lutheran settlement, and had an ethnic Slovak majority until the latter part of the 19th century, when the population became Magyarized. Also, Szabolcs County had a sizeable population of Greek Catholics, who were of Ruthenian and Romanian origin and who became almost entirely Magyarized by the end of the 19th century.



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Szabolcs county were:

<doc id="926166" wikidata="Q6650716" url="?curid=926166" title="Little London, Leeds">
<text>Little London is a residential area of Leeds in England, north of the city centre and Leeds Inner Ring Road. It is so called because in the 19th century it had fashionable housing and interesting architecture comparable to London. In the 1950s and &#x27;60s it became largely council housing and now consists of a mixture of high and low-rise flats and housing. The area falls within the Little London and Woodhouse ward of the City of Leeds Council. The area is divided into four estates; Lovell Park, Oatlands, Carlton and the Servias.

==History==

The area developed around an area then known as The Leylands in the 18th century, originally as a largely working class residential area housing workers for the area&#x27;s textile industry. In 1865 the Carlton Barracks opened in the area and is still open. By the 1950s the area had become dilapidated, with much of the area&#x27;s back-to-back housing being considered unfit for human habitation, and the area was redeveloped in a slum clearance scheme; around the same time the layout of the area was changed by the construction of the Leeds Inner Ring Road and the Sheepscar Interchange. As part of the area&#x27;s redevelopment, the main thoroughfare, Camp Road, was renamed Lovell Park Road to the south and Oatlands Lane further north. There are a few buildings in the area that predate the redevelopment during the 1960s and 1970s, All Souls&#x27; Church being one of them. A more modest redevelopment of the area was undertaken in the 2010s.

==Description==
The area backs onto the Sheepscar Interchange, a major road interchange between the A61 towards Harrogate and the A58 towards Wetherby) and the Leeds Inner Ring Road.

To the east of Lovell Park Road is the Oatland estate (i.e. the street names mainly include Oatland). This includes Little London Primary School which was opened in 1974, then closed because of an arson attack in 1995. It re-opened, refurbished in 1999 as Little London Community Primary School. It also includes a community centre and three tower blocks. To the west is the Carlton estate which includes two 12-storey blocks of flats which were built in 1965 and since refurbished, Carlton Croft and Carlton Close. This is named from the 19th century Carlton Barracks which is still in operation. The local pub is The Leeds Rifleman: its name was changed from Windsor Castle in 1984 to honour the 125th anniversary of the founding of the Leeds Rifle Regiment. There were previously two pubs on the Lovel Park Estate; the Londoner and the Hobby Horse and the Oatland estate boasted the Kings Arms and the Lovell Park social club but all these have since closed leaving the Leeds Rifleman on the Carlton Estate as the sole remaining pub.

To the south of Claypit Lane is the Lovell Park estate. 
===Crime===
In the early 2000s ASBOs had been issued in the Little London area to counter drug dealing and anti-social behaviour. The leader of the Labour Party Group on Leeds Council thought that these orders had been achieving a reduction in crime in the area. In 2003 66 ASBOs were issued in Little London as a crackdown on anti-social behaviour and drug dealing, the area of Blackman Lane identified as a centre for supply of controlled drugs and attendant criminality. The tenants and residents association, along with politicians, expressed support for the police action, which was assured would continue. In a letter to the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; in 2004, he expressed the view that support for ASBOs by the Council needed to be sustained as residents in Little London had noticed a then recent increase in drug dealing, and he hoped that the council would continue to commit funding and commitment to the problem.

In November 2011 Little London became a target for street robberies, sometimes accompanied with violence, over Bonfire Night weekend and later in the month

==Redevelopment==

Starting in 2010 the Carlton Estate was redeveloped with both blocks of the aging 1950s built Carlton Towers being demolished. Following the demolition new low-rise and medium-rise housing was built as well as new shops and a community centre Later in the decade the high-rise blocks on the Oatland Estate were refurbished and reclad. The blocks on the Lovell Park estate were refurbished although have not been reclad and retain their original brick cladding. Around the same time the Holbeck district was redeveloped in a similar way; in both cases the slab style blocks were considered uneconomical for repair while the newer &#x27;H&#x27; blocks were refurbished.
==Transport==
The area is situated close to the Sheepscar Interchange where the A58 and A61 converge and also the Leeds Inner Ring Road. There is no railway station in the vicinity. Buses serving the area are operated by First Leeds. Leeds City Centre is within walking distance.

==Notable people==
* Will Scott (1893â1964), author born at 128 Camp Road (now demolished and renamed Oatland Lane)
* Frank Percy Wild, (1861â1950), artist, was born at 50 Camp Road

<doc id="926172" wikidata="Q1414932" url="?curid=926172" title="Tenor saxophone">
<text>The tenor saxophone is a medium-sized member of the saxophone family, a group of instruments invented by Adolphe Sax in the 1840s. The tenor and the alto are the two most commonly used saxophones. The tenor is pitched in the key of B (while the alto is pitched in the key of E), and written as a transposing instrument in the treble clef, sounding an octave and a major second lower than the written pitch. Modern tenor saxophones which have a high F key have a range from A2 to E5 (concert) and are therefore pitched one octave below the soprano saxophone. People who play the tenor saxophone are known as &quot;tenor saxophonists&quot;, &quot;tenor sax players&quot;, or &quot;saxophonists&quot;.

The tenor saxophone uses a larger mouthpiece, reed and ligature than the alto and soprano saxophones. Visually, it is easily distinguished by the curve in its neck, or its crook, near the mouthpiece. The alto saxophone lacks this and its neck goes straight to the mouthpiece. The tenor saxophone is most recognized for its ability to blend well with the soprano, alto, and baritone saxophones, with its &quot;husky&quot; yet &quot;bright&quot; tone.

The tenor sax has been an important solo instrument in jazz music. Famous and influential players include Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Ben Webster, Dexter Gordon, Wardell Gray, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter. The work of younger players such as Michael Brecker and Chris Potter has been an important influence in more recent jazz.

==History==

The tenor saxophone is one of a family of fourteen
instruments designed and constructed in 1846 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian-born instrument maker, flautist and clarinetist. Based on an amalgam of ideas drawn from the clarinet, flute, oboe and ophicleide, the saxophone was intended to form a tonal link between the woodwinds and brass instruments found in military bands, an area that Sax considered sorely lacking. Sax&#x27;s patent, granted on 28 June 1846, divided the family into two groups of seven instruments, each ranging from soprano down to contrabass. One family, pitched alternatively in B and E, was designed specifically to integrate with the other instruments then common in military bands. The tenor saxophone, pitched in B, is the fourth member of this family.

==Description==

The tenor saxophone, like all saxophones, consists of an approximately conical tube of thin brass, a type of metal. The wider end of the tube is flared slightly to form a bell, while the narrower end is connected to a single reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. At intervals down the bore is placed between 20 and 23 tone holes; these are covered by pads which can be pressed onto the holes to form an airtight seal. There are also two small speaker holes which, when opened, disrupt the lower harmonics of the instrument and cause it to overblow into an upper register. The pads are controlled by pressing several keys with the fingers of the left and right hands; the left thumb controls an octave key which opens one or other of the speaker holes. The original design of the tenor saxophone had a separate octave key for each speaker hole, in the manner of the bassoon; the mechanism by which the correct speaker hole is selected based on the fingering of the left hand (specifically the left ring finger) was developed soon after Sax&#x27;s patent expired in 1866.

Although a handful of novelty tenors have been constructed &#x27;straight&#x27;, like the smaller members of the saxophone family, the unwieldy length of the straight configuration means that almost all tenor saxophones feature a &#x27;U-bend&#x27; above the third-lowest tone hole which is characteristic of the saxophone family. The tenor saxophone is also curved at the top, above the highest tone hole but below the highest speaker hole. While the alto is usually bent only through 80â90Â° to make the mouthpiece fit more easily in the mouth, the tenor is usually bent a little more in this section, incorporating a slight S-bend.

The mouthpiece of the tenor saxophone is very similar to that of the clarinet: an approximately wedge-shaped tube, open along one face and covered in use by a thin strip of material prepared from the stem of the giant cane (&quot;Arundo donax&quot;) commonly known as a reed. The reed is shaved to come to an extremely thin point and is clamped over the mouthpiece by the use of a ligature. When air is blown through the mouthpiece, the reed vibrates and generates the acoustic resonances required to produce a sound from the instrument. The mouthpiece is the area of the saxophone with the greatest flexibility in shape and style, so the timbre of the instrument is primarily determined by the dimensions of its mouthpiece. The design of the mouthpiece and reed plays a big role in how a saxophone sounds. Classical mouthpieces generally help produce a warmer and rounder tone, while jazz mouthpieces generally help produce a brighter and edgier tone. Materials used in mouthpiece construction include plastic, ebonite and various metals, for example bronze, brass and stainless steel.

The mouthpiece of the tenor saxophone is proportionally larger than that of the alto, necessitating a similarly larger reed. The increased stiffness of the reed and the greater airflow required to establish resonance in the larger body means the tenor sax requires greater lung power but a looser embouchure than the higher-pitched members of the saxophone family. The tenor sax reed is similar in size to that used in the bass clarinet, and the two can be easily substituted.

==Uses==

The tenor saxophone first gained popularity in one of its original intended roles: the military band. Soon after its invention, French and Belgian military bands began to take full advantage of the instrument that Sax had designed specifically for them. Modern military bands typically incorporate a quartet of saxophone players playing the E baritone, tenor, E alto and B soprano. British military bands customarily make use only of the tenor and alto saxes, with two or more musicians on each instrument.

The tenor is used in classical music. It is a standard instrument in concert bands and saxophone quartets. It also has a body of solo repertoire. The tenor is sometimes used as a member of the orchestra in pieces such as Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Lieutenant KijÃ© Suite&quot; and Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;BolÃ©ro&quot;. Charles Ives employs a tenor in his Fourth Symphony. Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote for a tenor in his opera &quot;Fervaal&quot;. Lukas Foss includes a tenor in his Symphony No. 2. BÃ©la BartÃ³k used the tenor and other saxes in his ballet &quot;The Wooden Prince&quot;. Igor Stravinsky has two tenors performing in his &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot;.

Much of the popularity of saxophones in the United States derives from the large number of military bands that were around at the time of the American Civil War. After the war, former military band instruments found their way into the hands of the general public, where they were often used to play gospel music and jazz. The work of the pioneering bandleader Patrick Gilmore (1829â1892) was highly influential; he was one of the first arrangers to pit brass instruments (trumpet, trombone and cornet) against reeds (clarinet and saxophone) in a manner that has now become the norm for big-band arrangements.

The tenor saxophone became best known to the general public through its frequent use in jazz music. It was the pioneering genius of Coleman Hawkins in the 1930s that lifted the tenor saxophone from its traditional role of adding weight to the ensemble and established it as a highly effective melody instrument in its own right. Many innovative jazz musicians from the 1930s onwards have been tenor saxophone players. The strong resonant sound of Hawkins and his followers was in contrast with the lighter approach of Lester Young and his school. During the bebop years, the most prominent tenor sounds in jazz were those of the Four Brothers in the Woody Herman orchestra, including Stan Getz who in the 1960s went on to great popular success playing the Brazilian bossa nova sound on tenor saxophone (not forgetting John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins). In recent years, the tenor continues to be very popular with fans of smooth jazz music, being played by artists such as Kirk Whalum, Richard Elliot, Steve Cole and Jessy J. Saxophonists Ron Holloway and Karl Denson are two of the major proponents of the tenor on the jam band music scene. Van Morrison, learned music notation and tenor saxophone lessons from fellow Hyndford Street neighbour, jazz musician George Cassidy, who specialised in tenor saxophone.Morrison and Cassidy bonded over this, becoming great friends.

Former president Bill Clinton has played the tenor saxophone for much of his life. He received a special-edition saxophone while in office. 

As a result of its prominence in American jazz, the instrument has also featured prominently in other genres. The tenor is common in rhythm and blues music and has a part to play in rock and roll and more recent rock music as well as African American, Latin American, Afro-Caribbean, and African music.

<text>Lovell Park is an inner-city area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. The area falls within the Hyde Park and Woodhouse ward of the Leeds Metropolitan Council.

Lovell Park along with its adjacent areas Little London and Blenheim, is an area of 1960s high-rise and maisonette council housing situated between the city centre and Sheepscar.

The Londoner Public House in Little London was demolished in 2007 and a new 25-storey tower block, the Opal Tower, has been constructed on its former site. The only pub now remaining in Lovell Park is The Leeds Rifleman. The estate has only one shop, Lovell Park Stores, an independent newsagent/ convenience store/ off-licence. There are further shops within five minutes walk in the Merrion Centre, other parts of Leeds city centre and other parts of Little London.

In the 1990s the Leeds Permanent Building Society relocated its offices from what is now The Light in Leeds city centre, to a new building in Lovell Park. This now belongs to Lloyds Banking Group.

Lovell Park Towers was used for the filming of &quot;Married Single Other&quot;.

The site of Lovell Park itself was the site of a cattle market which dates back to before 1860.

<text>An anti-tank gun is a form of artillery designed to destroy tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles, normally from a static defensive position. The development of specialized anti-tank munitions and anti-tank guns was prompted by the appearance of tanks during World War I. To destroy hostile tanks, artillerymen often used field guns depressed to fire directly at their targets, but this practice expended too much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker. The first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s, and by World War II was a common appearance in many European armies. To penetrate armor, they fired specialized ammunition from longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns. Most anti-tank guns were developed in the 1930s as improvements in tanks were noted, and nearly every major arms manufacturer produced one type or another.

Anti-tank guns deployed during World War II were often manned by specialist infantry rather than artillery crews, and issued to light infantry units accordingly. The anti-tank guns of the 1920s and 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used 37 mm ammunition (the British Army used the slightly larger 40 mm 2-pounder gun). As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete, and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger and more effective armor-piercing shot. The development of the compact hollow charge projectile permanently altered anti-tank warfare, since this type of ammunition did not depend on a high muzzle velocity and could be fired from low-recoil, man-portable light weapons, such as the &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; and the American series of recoilless rifles.

Although several large-caliber guns were developed during the war that were capable of knocking out the most heavily armored tanks, they proved expensive and difficult to conceal. The later generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles the size of an artillery shell to be fired from the shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantry. Recoilless rifles replaced most conventional anti-tank guns in the postwar period; nevertheless, the development of new anti-tank guns exhibiting similar low-recoil performance continued until the late 1950s in France, Belgium, and the Soviet Union. A few Soviet designs saw combat well into the 1980s and 1990s.

==History==
===World War I and Interwar period===

The first specialized anti-tank weaponry consisted of anti-tank rifles. These emerged from the mixed results of deploying field artillery against tanks during World War I, and the need to produce a more economical weapon to destroy them. Most anti-tank rifles were over in length, however, and difficult for infantrymen to operate in the confines of their trenches. They could penetrate a tank&#x27;s armor at long range, but without explosive firepower, often failed to cause catastrophic damage, kill, or even seriously injure the crew, or disable the tank. A number of infantry support guns designed to defeat hard targets such as fortified machine gun emplacements were used as makeshift anti-tank weapons, including the French Canon d&#x27;Infanterie de 37 modÃ¨le 1916 TRP. The 3.7 cm Tankabwehrkanone 1918 im starrer RÃ¤derâlafette was probably the first dedicated anti-tank gun in service. However, its gun barrel was based on an earlier Hotchkiss 5-barrelled rotary-cannon. The 3.7Â cm TAK 1918 was designed and built for the Imperial German Army in 1918. The 3.7 cm Pak 36 which first appeared in 1928 was probably the first purpose-built anti-tank gun. Weighing some , the Pak 36 could inflict a catastrophic kill on a tank rather than merely penetrating its armor plate. Towed guns similar to the Pak 36 were the only anti-tank weapon issued to European armies during the 1930s, and a number of influential designs proliferated, such as the BÃ¶hler gun. By the late 1930s, anti-tank guns had been manufactured by companies in Germany, Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark, and Sweden. A few countries, such as the Soviet Union, also manufactured foreign designs under license.

=== World War II===

At the outbreak of World War II, most armies were fielding light anti-tank guns firing 37 mm ammunition. The guns were usually mounted on two-wheeled carriages so they could be towed into position, then withdrawn and repositioned rapidly. Since they weighed only a few hundred pounds on average, they could also be manhandled into position. All fired high-explosive and solid armor-piercing shot effective at ranges up to roughly , and an increasing number were manufactured with protective gun shields in addition to a split rail mounting. They were able to destroy tanks fielded by both sides during the first two years of the war, but soon proved impotent against the heavier tank armor that debuted in 1940.
French doctrine was for their infantry to let enemy tanks pass through, then stop the accompanying enemy infantry, leaving the unsupported tanks to be engaged by anti-tank guns deployed in three echelons. The issue of 58 guns per division provided 10 guns per kilometre of front, which was expected to be able to deal with enemy tanks at a concentration of 50 tanks per kilometer. In practice, the German invasion of France concentrated tanks in select divisions at up to 100 per kilometer.

Introducing improved ammunition and increasing muzzle velocity initially helped compensate for their mediocre performance, but small-caliber anti-tank guns clearly would soon be overtaken by yet more heavily armored tanks. Medium-caliber guns in the 40- to 50-mm range began to appear, some of which simply used rebored 37-mm barrels. Although they, too, were soon approaching obsolescence, most remained in use with infantry units until the end of the war. Anti-tank guns remained ineffective against sloped armor, as demonstrated by an incident in 1941 when a single Soviet T-34 tank was hit more than 30 times by a battalion-sized contingent of German 37 and 50-mm anti-tank guns. The tank survived intact and was driven back to its own lines a few hours later. This helped earn the Pak 36 the moniker of &quot;PanzeranklopfgerÃ¤t&quot; (&quot;tank door knocker&quot;) because its crew simply revealed their presence and wasted their shells without damaging the T-34&#x27;s armor. Anti-tank gunners began aiming at tank tracks, or vulnerable margins on the turret ring and gun mantlet, rather than testing their lighter cannon against bow and turret armor. These difficulties resulted in new types of ammunition being issued, namely high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) projectiles.

Towards the end of World War II, armor plating became still thicker, with tanks such as the Tiger II being fitted with armor over in thickness, as compared to which was more typical in 1939. This prompted the development of a third generation of anti-tank guns, large-caliber pieces in the 57- to 100-mm range. The British Army adopted the Ordnance QF 6-pounder and Ordnance QF 17-pounder, which were then considered great advances in firepower, and the Wehrmacht fielded the even larger 7.5 cm Pak 41 and 8.8 cm Pak 43. While the early 37-mm anti-tank guns were easily concealed and moved, the large-caliber weapons available late in the war required equally large vehicles to tow them into place, and were difficult to conceal, dig in, withdraw, or reposition. By 1945, large anti-tank guns had become almost impractical in their role, and their size and weight were considered liabilities. They were also expensive to produce and although they were capable of defeating the most formidable of opponents, most tank units still consisted of less heavily armoured models that remained vulnerable to less expensive and more practical guns, as well. Many heavy anti-tank guns were issued, at least initially, on the divisional level, but gradually made their way to individual infantry battalions.

Meanwhile, the effect of very compact hollow charge warheads was being noted, and a number of countries began producing man-portable anti-tank weapons using this ammunition. The development of man-portable, shoulder-fired, anti-tank rocket launchers began in 1941; most could be reloaded, but a few, such as the German Panzerfaust, were fired from disposable tubes. Unlike anti-tank guns, their light weight made them easily portable by individual infantrymen on the battlefield, and they offered similar degrees of firepower whilst being quicker and cheaper to produce.

Towed anti-tank guns disappeared from most Western countries, such as the United States, after World War II, to be replaced by shoulder-fired rocket launchers, recoilless rifles, and eventually, guided anti-tank missiles.

=== Postwar period ===

At the end of the war, German engineers had proposed a new, large-caliber anti-tank gun that used less propellant than a rocket or recoilless weapon, yet fired similar compact hollow-charge shells. German forces subsequently fielded the 8 cm PAW 600, which was an extremely lightweight, low-pressure weapon still able to fire the same ammunition types as higher-velocity anti-tank guns. In the 1950s, this idea was revived by a Belgian firm, Mecar, which subsequently improved on the concept and developed a low-pressure, smoothbore, 90-mm anti-tank gun. Because of its low recoil forces and light construction, the gun was particularly useful for being mounted on armored cars or small gun carriages. Its design inspired the lightly rifled French DEFA D921 anti-tank gun, which fired fin-stabilized shells and was available on a towed carriage or as a vehicle mount. It was later mated to the AML-90 and EBR series of French armored cars. The Soviet Union also adopted a similar design around the same time, the 100-mm T-12 anti-tank gun, which was smoothbore and fired fin-stabilized shells. Switzerland developed a postwar 90-mm anti-tank gun of its own, the Pak 50/57, firing shells with an even lower velocity than the Mecar or DEFA guns. Apart from the T-12, which used APDS rounds, these weapons could only use HEAT shells for armor-piercing purposes. France did introduce an APFSDS shell for the DEFA D921 at some point in the 1980s. The last country known to have produced a dedicated anti-tank gun was the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1988. The Chinese gun was known as the Norinco Type 86 and was probably manufactured as a replacement for the aging Soviet-sourced T-12.

Anti-tank guns continued to be used in a number of conflicts around the world, such as the Six-Day War and the South African Border War. Soviet anti-tank guns in particular were exported to at least 18 other countries after being retired from service, and have continued to see action.

==Self-propelled anti-tank guns==


Although still being drawn by horses or towed by trucks, towed anti-tank guns were initially much lighter and more portable than field guns, making them well-suited to infantry maneuvers. As their size and caliber increased, though, the guns likewise became increasingly heavy and cumbersome, restricting their role to static defense. In consequence, during World War II, both sides were compelled to make anti-tank guns self-propelled, which greatly increased their mobility.

The first self-propelled anti-tank guns were merely belated attempts to make use of obsolete tanks, such as the PanzerjÃ¤ger I, which was a Czech 4.7-cm Pak (t) gun mated to a Panzer I chassis. and were used in the Battle of France The trend continued with older tanks and captured vehicles, which were available in large numbers for conversions to self-propelled guns when they were replaced by heavier and better-armed (and armored) tanks. Although just a makeshift solution, these initial experiments proved so successful, they spawned an entire class of new vehicles: dedicated tank destroyers.

The US Army&#x27;s early self-propelled anti-tank guns were 75 mm on M2 half-tracks (entering service in 1941) to complement towed artillery and M6 gun motor carriage a 37 mm on 4-wheel-drive Dodge truck (1942). US tank destroyer doctrine emphasised mobility to place the tank destroyers into positions to ambush tank attacks.

Tank destroyers offered some advantages over towed anti-tank guns, since a static gun emplacement sacrificed concealment and surprise after firing the first shot, but the same gun mounted on a tracked or wheeled chassis could open fire and throw a tank formation into substantial disarray before quickly withdrawing to repeat the same tactic elsewhere. The introduction of tank destroyers also put an end to the traditional tactic of suppressing anti-tank gun batteries with heavy artillery bombardments, as their crews were now well-protected under armor. They were not without their own series of disadvantages, however, namely presenting a much larger target than a towed gun, the added responsibilities of vehicle maintenance and logistical support, and the limited spaces in which the crew had to operate and stow all their available ammunition.

By the end of the war, dedicated tank destroyers had been superseded by tanks, which were just as effective at destroying other tanks, and little incentive remained to continue their separate development. Nevertheless, much like towed anti-tank guns, they were widely exported and are still in service with some militaries in the late 20th and early 21st century.

<text>John Gilmore (September 28, 1931 â August 20, 1995) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, and percussionist. He was known for his tenure with the avant-garde keyboardist/bandleader Sun Ra from the 1950s to the 1990s, and led The Sun Ra Arkestra from Sun Ra&#x27;s death in 1993 until his own death in 1995.

==Biography==
Gilmore was raised in Chicago and played clarinet from the age of 14. He took up the tenor saxophone while serving in the United States Air Force from 1948 through 1951. He then pursued a musical career, beginning as a tenor saxophonist on a national tour with the Harlem Globetrotters in an ensemble that included pianist Earl Hines in 1952. 

In 1953 Gilmore met pianist and bandleader Sun Ra who had a profound impact on him as a musician. For the next four decades, he recorded and performed almost exclusively with Sun Ra; first as a trio, and then in the Sun Ra Arkestra. This was puzzling to some, who noted Gilmore&#x27;s talent, and thought he could be a major star like John Coltrane or Sonny Rollins. Despite being five years older than Gilmore, Coltrane was impressed with his playing, and took informal lessons from Gilmore in the late 1950s. Coltrane&#x27;s epochal, protoâfree jazz &quot;Chasin&#x27; the Trane&quot; was inspired partly by Gilmore&#x27;s sound. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; suggests Gilmore remained an influence in Coltrane&#x27;s later period, particularly on &quot;Sun Ship&quot;.

In the late 1950s Gilmore co-led a band with Clifford Jordan while simultaneously playing with Arkestra. In 1957 this ensemble recorded a Blue Note session which resulted in the album &quot;Blowing in from Chicago&quot;. The rhythm section featured Horace Silver, Curly Russell, and Art Blakey. During this period Gilmore also performed with jazz drummer Wilbur Campbell (1958), trumpeter Miles Davis (1959), saxophonist Johnny Griffin (1959), singer Dinah Washington (1959), and pianist Andrew Hill (1959); the latter of whom he had gone to school with as a boy in Chicago.

In 1960 Gilmore moved from Chicago to New York City with the other members of Arkestra. In the early 1960s he worked frequently as a sideman in gigs in New York with artists like trumpeter Freddie Hubbard (1962), singer and guitarist B.B. King (1963-1964), pianist Paul Bley (1964), Andrew Hill (1964), and drummer Art Blakey (1964). From 1964 through 1966 he toured with the Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers; replacing saxophonist Wayne Shorter in the ensemble. After this he performed with a variety of artists, including double bassist and pianist Charles Mingus (1966), pianists McCoy Tyner (1967) and George Russell (1968); drummer Art Taylor (1968); and trombonist Melba Liston (1969). During this time he also participated in recording sessions with Bley, Hill (&quot;Andrew!!!&quot; and &quot;Compulsion&quot;), Pete La Roca (&quot;Turkish Women at the Bath&quot;), McCoy Tyner (&quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot;) and a handful of others. In 1970, he co-led a recording with Jamaican trumpeter Dizzy Reece. His main focus throughout, however, remained with the Sun Ra Arkestra.

==Devotion to Sun Ra and his band==
Gilmore&#x27;s devotion to Sun Ra was due, in part, to the latter&#x27;s use of harmony, which Gilmore considered both unique and a logical extension of bebop. Gilmore had stated that Sun Ra was &quot;more stretched out than Monk&quot; and that &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna run across anybody who&#x27;s moving as fast as Sun Ra ... So I just stay where I am.&quot;

Gilmore occasionally doubled on drums and also played bass clarinet until Sun Ra hired Robert Cummings as a specialist on the latter instrument in the mid-1950s. However, tenor sax was his main instrument and Gilmore himself made a huge contribution to Sun Ra&#x27;s recordings and was the Arkestra&#x27;s leading sideman, being given solos on almost every track on which he appeared. In the &quot;Rough Guide to Jazz&quot;, Brian Priestley says:
Gilmore is known for two rather different styles of tenor playing. On performances of a straight ahead post-bop character (which include many of those with Sun Ra), he runs the changes with a fluency and tone halfway between Johnny Griffin and Wardell Gray, and with a rhythmic and motivic approach which he claims influenced Coltrane. On more abstract material, he is capable of long passages based exclusively on high-register squeals. Especially when heard live, Gilmore was one of the few musicians who carried sufficient conviction to encompass both approaches.

In the early 1970s, Gilmore moved to Philadelphia with Sun Ra and the other members of Arkestra. After Sun Ra died in 1993, Gilmore led Ra&#x27;s Arkestra for a few years before his own death from emphysema. Marshall Allen then took over leading the Arkestra.

== Landmarks==
Northeast is home to Gallaudet University, a federally chartered private university for the education of the deaf and hard of hearing located in the Trinidad neighborhood. It is also home to The Catholic University of America and Trinity Washington University, two of the Catholic institutions which give the Brookland neighborhood its nickname of &quot;Little Rome&quot; or &quot;Little Vatican.&quot; Others include the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the Saint John Paul II National Shrine, the Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery, the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy Family, Saint Anselm&#x27;s Abbey Benedictine Monastery, the Dominican House of Studies, the Missionaries of Charity Gift of Peace Home, the Capuchin College, and the headquarters of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The quadrant is home to two large public gardens located below the waistline of the Anacostia River: the United States National Arboretum and Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens. The headquarters of The Heritage Foundation, one of the nation&#x27;s largest think tanks, and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, a daily newspaper in the city, are also located in Northeast.

==Transportation==

Northeast is bounded by North Capitol Street on the west, Eastern Avenue to the east, and East Capitol Street to the south. Other principal roads include the BaltimoreâWashington Parkway (DC 295); Bladensburg Road and South Dakota Avenue running northâsouth; and Florida Avenue, Benning Road, New York Avenue (U.S. Route 50), and Rhode Island Avenue (U.S. Route 1) running eastâwest.

Northeast is served by five of the six lines of the Washington Metro: the Orange, Silver, Red, Blue, and Green Lines. Washington Union Station is a major intermodal hub, combining the busiest station in the Metrorail system; rail service by Amtrak, MARC, and Virginia Railway Express commuter rail systems. Bus services are provided by Greyhound, Peter Pan, Trailways, Megabus, and other companies. The DC Streetcar&#x27;s H Street NE/Benning Road Line also serves the area.

==Politics==
Politically, Northeast includes most of Ward 5, much of Ward 6 and Ward 7, and parts of Ward 4.

==Demographics==
The population of Northeast is predominantly African-American, particularly east of the Anacostia River.

<text>SzatmÃ¡r County ( ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary, situated south of the river Tisza. Most of its territory is now divided between Romania and Hungary, while a very small area is part of Ukraine.
The capital of the county was NagykÃ¡roly (now Carei).

==Geography==

After 1876, SzatmÃ¡r county shared borders with the former Hungarian counties of Szabolcs, Bereg, Ugocsa, MÃ¡ramaros, Szolnok-Doboka, SzilÃ¡gy and Bihar. It was situated south of the river Tisza. The rivers Crasna, SomeÅ, LÄpuÈ and Tur flowed through the county. Its area was 6,257Â km2 around 1910.

==History==

SzatmÃ¡r county was formed in the 11th century, with the center in SzatmÃ¡rnÃ©meti (now Satu Mare). In Ottoman times, the county mostly belonged to Partium. In 1876, when the administrative structure of the Kingdom of Hungary was changed, part of the territory of the former KÅvÃ¡rvidÃ©k/Chioar district was annexed to SzatmÃ¡r.

In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon assigned most of the territory of the county to Romania. The northwest of the county remained in Hungary, and formed the new county of SzatmÃ¡r-Ugocsa-Bereg in 1923, with parts of the former Bereg and Ugocsa counties (the capital of this county was MÃ¡tÃ©szalka, which was previously in SzatmÃ¡r county). The village of NagypalÃ¡d (now Velika Palad&#x27;) was passed to Czechoslovakia in 1921, after a border adjustment agreement with Romania (according to the agreement, the villages of Akli/Okli and FertÅsalmÃ¡s/Fertesolmas were also passed to Czechoslovakia, whereas BocskÃ³/BocicÄu, UgocsakomlÃ³s/ComlÄuÈa, Avaspatak/Valea SeacÄ and Nagytarna/Tarna Mare were passed to Romania).

By the First Vienna Award, NagypalÃ¡d was returned to Hungary and the county was recreated and later expanded with the Romanian part by the Second Vienna Award in 1940. After the end of World War II, this part became again part of Romania and NagypalÃ¡d was passed to the Soviet Union, while the remaining territory in Hungary was renamed to SzatmÃ¡r-Bereg county.

In 1950, SzatmÃ¡r-Bereg County was merged with large parts of Szabolcs county to form Szabolcs-SzatmÃ¡r county. This county was renamed Szabolcs-SzatmÃ¡r-Bereg in the 1990s.

The Romanian part of the county is now part of Satu Mare County, except for the easternmost part (including Baia Mare), which is in MaramureÈ County.

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of SzatmÃ¡r county were:

Csenger, FehÃ©rgyarmat and MÃ¡tÃ©szalka are now in Hungary; the other towns mentioned are now in Romania.

<text>James T. Luken (December 31, 1921 â July 12, 1979) was an American politician and labor union leader of the Democratic party, who served as mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the 1970s.

==Career==
After graduating from Norwood High School, Luken started a milk delivery route in 1941. At age 26, he was elected president of the Milk and Ice Cream Drivers and Dairy Workers Local 98 and would continue to serve in that role for the rest of his life. The Milk Driver&#x27;s Union was a subsidiary of the Teamsters. Luken was one of the few Teamsters who stood up to the corrupt leadership of Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa. Luken withdrew the dairy workers from the Teamsters Union and testified against Hoffa before the United States Senate.

Luken served in the Ohio House of Representatives from January 1, 1973 until December 1, 1975, when he resigned after being elected to Cincinnati City Council. The following year he became Mayor of Cincinnati.

==Personal life==
Luken was one of eight children in his family. His brother Tom Luken and his nephew Charlie Luken, both served as U.S. representatives and mayors of Cincinnati.

Luken died in 1979 and is interred at New St. Joseph Cemetery.

<text>SzilÃ¡gy (Romanian: SÄlaj) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in north-western Romania. The capital of the county was Zilah (present-day ZalÄu in Romania).

==Geography==

SzilÃ¡gy county shared borders with the Hungarian counties of Bihar, SzatmÃ¡r, Szolnok-Doboka and Kolozs. The rivers SomeÅ and Crasna flowed through the county. Its territory was largely the same as that of the present Romanian county SÄlaj. Its area was 3,815Â km2 around 1910.

==History==
The area has been inhabited by Hungarians since the land-taking, with the Romanian population arriving in the late 16th century and the Germans in the 18th century.

SzilÃ¡gy county was formed in 1876, when the counties of Kraszna (its center was Kraszna/Crasna at first, then ValkÃ³vÃ¡ralja/Sub Cetate, later SzilÃ¡gysomlyÃ³/Èimleu Silvaniei), KÃ¶zÃ©p-Szolnok (its center was Zilah/ZalÄu) and the Egregy/Agrij district of Doboka County were united.

The county consisted of two regions, &quot;SzilÃ¡gy&quot; and &quot;KÅvÃ¡r-vidÃ©k&quot;. KÅvÃ¡r-vidÃ©k was a special administrative region in the Medieval and Early Modern Era Hungary administered by a Captain general.

In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania. It was returned to Hungary by the Second Vienna Award in 1940, with a slightly modified territory. After World War II, it became again part of Romania. Most of it is now part of the Romanian county SÄlaj, except for some areas in the north-west (now in Satu Mare county) and north-east (now in MaramureÅ county).

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of SzilÃ¡gy county were:

<doc id="926203" wikidata="Q2266405" url="?curid=926203" title="Parasite Eve II">
<text>is a 1999 action role-playing game released for the PlayStation. The game was developed and published by Square, published in Japan in 1999 and in both North America and, unlike the previous game, in PAL regions in 2000. It is the sequel to &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; and the second game in the series of the same name.

&quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; is set three years after the events in the original game. The protagonist from the first game, Aya Brea, also features in this game as the playable character. She becomes involved with another outbreak of Neo-Mitochondrial creatures. Gameplay diverges from the previous game: battles take place in real time and the area of action is less restrictive. The approach is more typical of traditional survival horror games, although some role-playing elements are retained. The title was written and directed by Kenichi Iwao, who wrote &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (1996).

The game was well received by critics, although it was criticized for using a control system that was seen as being outdated.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; is an action role-playing survival horror video game. It uses tank controls: Aya is able to move forwards, backwards, and pivot left and right. Camera movement is limited, generally being confined to a single view of a room or area, and cannot be altered by the player.

Unlike &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, there is no Active Time Bar that governs the order of actions during a battle. Battles take place in real time, so the player is free to act as they see fit. Another contrast is the absence of the &#x27;range dome&#x27; seen in the first game, allowing the player to shoot at off-screen targets and engage targets from a safe distance. There are also no random battles; enemies will be found wandering in plain view, hence allowing the player to avoid confrontations and plan strategies. Aiming, as with most other games of this genre, is accomplished by cycling through the various &#x27;lockable&#x27; targets within Aya&#x27;s range.

Having locked her abilities gained in the original game, players have to &quot;rediscover&quot; abilities available with Aya&#x27;s parasite energy (PE). This is done by using EXP gained from defeating enemies. However, whereas the first game used a levelling up system, in which abilities are unlocked at certain levels, the sequel allows players to choose freely which abilities they want to prioritise. These are categorised into 4 elements and can be summarised as follows: fire for offensive abilities, water for health-related abilities, wind for status-related abilities, earth for abilities that affect damage stats (given or taken). There are 3 abilities in each element category, and each ability has three tiers (level 1, 2 and 3), with level 3 being the most powerful and costing the least MP.

There are 48 enemy variations in Parasite Eve IIâs âbounty rosterâ, each having their own unique attacks, strengths, and weaknesses. Thirteen of these enemies are bosses, dealing more damage and having higher health totals than the rest of the roster.

Equipment can be obtained through various methods, including finding, purchasing and &#x27;creating&#x27; items such as body armor, weapons, ammunition and tools. Many items fulfill two roles. The player has the option to either utilize them directly from their inventory or attach them to Aya&#x27;s armor. To figure out both of the effects these items can have, players are advised to consult the gameâs âitemsâ page for a detailed overview. Unlike most other survival horror games, ammunition is almost never in short supply. While Aya can only carry limited amounts of equipment with her, inexhaustible ammunition boxes exist in most areas and can be revisited as often as required for a top-up. This encourages the player to fight rather than run, which is essential to the gameplay as it is the only way to gain experience and thus for Aya to become powerful enough to succeed. While equipment follows the original game&#x27;s concept of being customizable, in general the weapons and armor are quite limited in the alterations available. Armor, which not only reduces damage but also affects the amount Aya can carry, has the option of adding extra item slots up to a limit of ten.

Once the game has been completed, bonus items become available for the player should they choose to redo the game in Replay mode. After playing through the game, players are awarded a ranking based on the total amount of EXP they&#x27;ve accumulated. The ranking received will add 3 new items to the shop list available in Replay mode, the items depend on the ranking, with higher ranks yielding better items. Other modes also become available, such as Bounty Hunter and Scavenger which are more difficult for the player to complete. The most difficult mode &quot;Nightmare&quot; only becomes available after completing the game in Scavenger Mode.

== Plot ==
In September 2000, nearly three years after the events of the first game, Aya Brea, now an FBI operative working in the clandestine Mitochondrial Investigation and Suppression Team (MIST) department; is dispatched to the Akropolis Tower shopping mall in Los Angeles as back up the LAPD SWAT team in response to reports of Neo-Mitochondrial Creatures (NMC) sightings. As Aya and her partner Rupert Broderick investigate the tower they discover a new form of NMC with the power to pass as human which was able to slaughter the first SWAT team responders. As Aya works to exterminate the NMCs she discovers the building is wired to explode and encounters No. 9, psychopathic NMC / GOLEM who injures Rupert. Aya fends off No. 9 but barely escapes with Rupert when No. 9 triggers the detonators on the building.

Following the raid Aya is sent by MIST director Eric &quot;Hal&quot; Baldwin to investigate the desert town of Dryfield, Nevada, over reports of unusual animals. While initially displeased with the assignment, Aya learns from MIST&#x27;s technical expert Pierce Carradine that an implant recovered from one of the new NMCs has desert sand unique to that area of Nevada near Dryfield. Aya arrives to find the tiny town overrun with NMCs and makes contact with Gary Douglas, a survivalist and gun enthusiast who is the sole remaining inhabitant of the town, his dog, Flint, and Kyle Madigan, a private investigator who claims he is on a mission similar to Aya&#x27;s. He tells her about &quot;The Shelter&quot;, a nearby underground facility that may hold the answers to the recent outbreak of NMCs.

After spending some time in Dryfield and having another run-in with No. 9, Aya and Kyle are able to reach an entrance into the Shelter within an abandoned mine. As Aya explores the Shelter which has become overrun with NMCs she discovers numerous scientific facilities and learns that the Shelter was created to enact the &quot;Second Neoteny Plan&quot;, a project to deliberately create Artificial Neo-Mitochondrial Creatures (ANMCs, the new humanoid creatures) in the belief that they are superior to humanity. Aya also learns that the mutant mitochondria the ANMCs were created with is actually her own, and with the aid of Pierce learns that the Shelter acquired her genetic material directly from Baldwin and MIST, which has secret ties to the conspiracy that founded the Shelter. She also learns that the Second Neoteny Plan is nearing its culmination with a massive cocoon containing an ANMC that, when fully grown, will be able to generate a vector virus that will transform the entire human race into ANMCs.

Haunted by visions of a mysterious girl and seeking to put an end to the threat from the Shelter, Aya progresses into the Neo-Ark, a zoo-like artificial construction hidden deep in the Shelter. Originally intended to be a showcase of ANMCs with multiple different habitats and viewing platforms, Neo-Ark was ground zero for the outbreak of creatures and has also been overrun by various kinds of NMCs. Aya is able to disable the two organic power generators to reach the depths of the Shelter, and finds the mystery girl. After defeating her ANMC guardian, Aya is able to discover that the girl, Eve, was cloned from Aya&#x27;s genetic material to be the final key to the Second Neoteny Plan. As Aya, Eve, and Kyle make their way to escape from the Shelter they&#x27;re ambushed by No. 9 who is able to kidnap Eve.

Chasing No. 9, Aya encounters a small army of his mindless GOLEMs, the Shelter&#x27;s force of genetically enhanced cyborg &quot;hunters&quot;, but is rescued by the US Marines, who have been alerted by Aya&#x27;s contacts at MIST and learns that Douglas has been evacuated and that Dryfield has been sealed off. Aya fights her way back into the Shelter to rescue Eve and finds her at the ANMC cocoon along with No. 9 and Kyle, who seems to be working with him. No. 9 attempts to use Eve to hatch the monstrous ANMC when Kyle betrays him, revealing he was a double agent sent to infiltrate the Shelter&#x27;s conspiracy, and allows No. 9 to be eaten by the ANMC cocoon. At the same time, to contain the threat of the NMCs, the US President orders the use of a Satellite Weapon to destroy Dryfield and the Shelter, prematurely hatching the ANMC. Aya fatally injures the final ANMC, but it is able to devour Eve creating a new form of the monstrous Mitochondria Eve. Aya is able to destroy this new incarnation of Mitochondria Eve and manages to rescue Eve, putting an end to the Second Neoteny Plan for good. However, Kyle vanishes after the battle.

In the aftermath Aya adopts Eve as her younger sister, Rupert takes over as leader of MIST after purging the corrupt elements of the organization, and Pierce begins work on a plan to reveal the existence of Neo-Mitochondria to the public. One year later, Aya and Eve travel to the Natural History Museum in New York where she reunites with Kyle.

==Development==
Development of &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; was handled by Square, developers of the original &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;. The game was directed and written by Kenichi Iwao, who had previously worked in those roles for the 1996 survival horror game &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. Due to its popularity at the time, Square decided to design a new &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; game which emulated that style. The game was originally intended to be a spin-off of the first game with Kyle as the main protagonist; this was the main reason for the shift in genre and gameplay. During development, it was decided to turn the game into an official sequel to &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, making Aya the main protagonist and removing Kyle as a playable character. Production was handled by an entirely new development team based in Osaka. The staff included several former &quot;Resident Evil&quot; staff members. Using feedback from the original game, the team decreased and smoothed the transition between exploration and battle, and adjusted the controls to be more user-friendly. The character of Aya had been created for &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; by the producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, and designed by artist Tetsuya Nomura. Her design in &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; was handled by a different artist, using her original design as a template. While most of the design was finalized, the new designer had quit halfway through the game&#x27;s development, and Nomura was called in again. As the in-game model had already been created, he preserved what had already been done while adding touches of his own.

After the game was done, the team was merged with those behind &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot;, &quot;Mana&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; to make &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;.

===Music===
The score for &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; was composed by Naoshi Mizuta, serving as his first work at Square after leaving Capcom in 1998. It took Mizuta a year and a half to compose the soundtrack. He states he was given quite a bit of freedom in his composition, and drew most of his influence from watching the game&#x27;s already completed scenario. The game&#x27;s music is depicted as being much more ambient than its predecessor. The sound effects of &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; were influenced by futuristic and sci-fi themes. The 66-track two-disc &quot;Parasite Eve II Original Soundtrack&quot; was released by DigiCube on December 20, 1999, in Japan. The soundtrack was released in North America by Tokyopop on September 12, 2000.

== Release ==
Parasite Eve II was released in Japan on December 16, 1999. It was released in North America on September 12, 2000, and in Europe on August 25, 2000. The game sold over 220,000 copies in Japan during 1999. It shipped 1.09 million copies by February 2004, with 0.43 million sold in Japan and 0.66 million sold in the rest of the world. In late 2000, the game was re-released as part of the Square Millennium Collection along with a figure of Aya and a portrait of her character model, Yumiko Shaku. The game was re-released as part of the PSone Books best-seller line by Sony in Japan in 2002.

In early September 2010, posts made on Twitter in relation to the spin-off title &quot;The 3rd Birthday&quot; suggested that &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; 1 and 2 would be added to the PlayStation Network&#x27;s game download service. On October 28 these rumors were proven to be correct, with &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; being given a November 4 release date and &quot;Parasite Eve 2&quot; arriving on the PlayStation Network in Japan on November 24. &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; was released on the North American PlayStation Network on August 23, 2011.

==Reception==
&quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Greg Orlando reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Square seems to have taken to heart most of the criticism from the original. &quot;Eve II&quot; is scary good fun.&quot;

<doc id="926209" wikidata="Q4118615" url="?curid=926209" title="Surtax">
<text>A surtax is a tax levied upon another tax, also known as tax surcharge.

==Canada==
The provincial portion of the value-added tax on goods and services in two Canadian jurisdictions, Quebec and Prince Edward Island, was formerly calculated as a surtax on the sticker price plus the federal Goods and Services Tax. On Prince Edward Island, provincial sales tax was assessed at 10% on top of the federal tax (as of 2013) of 5%, resulting in a total effective rate of 15.5% at the time of its repeal. The Quebec Sales Tax was 9.5%, also assessed on top of the federal tax of 5%, resulting in a total tax burden of 14.975; it, too, was changed in 2013 so as no longer to be a surtax.

==United Kingdom==
In 1929, the supertax (which had been introduced in the Finance Act 1909 at the rate of 6 old pence in the pound (2.5%) on incomes over Â£5,000 per year) was renamed to surtax. By 1934, the rate was variable from 1 shilling to 7 shillings and sixpence in the pound (5% to 37.5%). It was replaced by income tax in 1973.

==United States==
Previous examples of a broadly-levied surtax in the United States include one imposed to help finance the Vietnam War during the Lyndon Johnson administration. It essentially consisted of calculating one&#x27;s ordinary federal income tax liability and then adding another 10% to it, the amount of the surtax.

As the US income tax system at the time was highly progressive, the surtax was much higher on those with higher incomes, as a 10% surtax imposed on a tax rate of 20% would result in an overall rate of 22%, and the same surtax imposed on a rate of 50% would result in an overall rate of 55%.

Some antiwar protesters refused to pay the tax and stated that while they were not anarchists and understood the need for and the positive role played by government in many areas, they wanted none of their tax money going to a war that they felt was immoral. The surtax was repealed well before the Vietnam War ended.

Surtaxes can be imposed on other taxes. They are usually imposed on the grounds of moral justification, as they affect only persons who are already paying taxes, rather than extending taxation to new areas or persons who are not previously being taxed.

A surtax of 4.3 percent was recently proposed by Congress on incomes over $500,000 to alleviate the alterations to the Alternative Minimum Tax code in the United States.

A surtax was proposed as part of the 2009â2010 health care reform in the United States.

<doc id="926210" wikidata="Q25153" url="?curid=926210" title="Angelo Branduardi">
<text>Angelo Branduardi (born 12 February 1950) is an Italian folk/folk rock singer-songwriter and composer who scored relative success in Italy and European countries such as France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Greece.

== Early and personal life ==
Branduardi was born in Cuggiono, a small town in the province of Milan, but early moved with the family to Genoa. He was educated as a classical violinist at the Genoa Conservatory. At the age of 18, he composed the music for the &quot;Confessioni di un malandrino&quot; (&quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Confession&quot;) by Sergei Yesenin.

He is married to Luisa Zappa, who wrote the lyrics for many of his songs. They have two daughters, Sarah and Maddalena, both musicians.

== Career ==
=== Beginnings ===
Branduardi&#x27;s first album was never released, and resulted from a co-operation with Maurizio Fabrizio, composer and gifted performer. The first released album, &quot;Angelo Branduardi &#x27;74&quot; was arranged with Paul Buckmaster.

=== The minstrel ===
&quot;La Luna&quot; (&quot;The Moon&quot;), including &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Confession&quot; (translation of a poem by Esenin) and the fine, delicate song giving the LP its name, was a prelude to the success of the following works. &quot;Alla fiera dell&#x27;Est&quot; (English edition: &quot;Highdown Fair&quot;, 1976) was Branduardi&#x27;s first vastly popular album, followed by &quot;La Pulce d&#x27;Acqua&quot; (English version, &quot;Fables and Fantasies&quot; 1978) and &quot;Cogli la prima mela&quot; (English edition, &quot;Life is the Only Teacher&quot;, 1979). Lyrics for the English versions of Branduardi&#x27;s albums were written by Peter Sinfield, also lyricist for King Crimson and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.

In those albums, Branduardi exploited themes and patterns from early music, mostly Renaissance and early Baroque. The song &quot;Alla fiera dell&#x27;Est&quot; (&quot;At the Eastern Fair&quot;) is still popular among Italians of every age, who test themselves committing to memory all the fable-like, repetitive lyrics. It is based on an old Jewish song in Aramaic (&quot;Chad Gadya&quot; â One Kid Goat) sung at the end of the Passover Seder night service. In 2007 &quot;Alla fiera dell&#x27;Est&quot; was covered by Israeli singer Shlomi Shabat for a Passover time commercial for cellphone company Pelephone.

Lyrics had a broad spectrum of inspiration: a Danse macabre, the theme of Satan&#x27;s mistress, Chinese, Native American and Druidic tradition, the apocryphal Gospels. Concertation owes much to the talents of Maurizio Fabrizio, and exploits unusual instruments for pop music: dulcimer, Pan flute, lute, clarinet, among others â mixed with more standard guitar, bass and drums.

=== Experimentation and crisis ===
Subsequent albums showed an increasing desire towards experimentation and differentiation. &quot;Branduardi&quot; (1981) had a more intimate tone, &quot;Cercando l&#x27;oro&quot; (&quot;Searching for Gold&quot;, 1983) had very sophisticated and delicate arrangements (starts with a String Quartet), &quot;Branduardi canta Yeats&quot; (&quot;Branduardi sings Yeats&quot;, 1985) was a tribute to William Butler Yeats. &quot;Pane e rose&quot; (&quot;Bread and Roses&quot;, 1988) was a still inspired, but increasingly dark picture of life and death. &quot;Il Ladro&quot; (&quot;The Thief&quot;, 1991) marked a very delicate point of Branduardi&#x27;s life, edging on depression, echoed in a dark, almost cemeterial, style of singing.

The album &quot;Si puÃ² fare&quot; (&quot;It Can Be Done&quot;, 1993) brought back Branduardi to normality, but the artist is now struggling to evade the &quot;minstrel&quot; character which was now too tight for him. In 1994, he published &quot;Domenica e lunedÃ¬&quot; (&quot;Sunday and Monday&quot;), dedicated to the Italian poet Franco Fortini who was one of Branduardi&#x27;s professors in his school years.

=== New directions ===
In 1996, during the celebrations for the restoration of the Duomo of Spilimbergo after the catastrophic 1976 earthquake, he recorded the album &quot;Futuro antico&quot; (&quot;Ancient Future&quot;), in which he, as an early Baroque musician, keeps reusing, mixing, wording pre-existing material along with his own. This experience, accomplished with the aid of musicians and musicologists, continued with &quot;Futuro antico II&quot; and &quot;Futuro antico III&quot;. The same year he performed &quot;Te vojo &#x27;bbene assaje&quot; (&quot;I love you so much&quot; in Neapolitan) with Italian pop singer Eugenio Finardi.

In 1998, Branduardi teamed up with Italian stand-up comedian and writer Giorgio Faletti for &quot;Il dito e la luna&quot; (&quot;The Finger and the Moon&quot;).

He subsequently reworked earlier musical themes with writings of and about St. Francis to produce &quot;L&#x27;infinitamente piccolo&quot; (&quot;The Infinitely Small&quot;); he wrote a musical on the same topic (&quot;Francesco&quot;).

In 2003, a new album, &quot;Altro ed altrove&quot; (&quot;Other and Elsewhere&quot;), in a time period marked by a rise of racism and intolerance, brought together (mainly) love stories from several cultures.

For the last 10 years, his band, on stage, has been composed of Davide Raggazoni (drums), Michele Ascolese (guitars), Leonardo Pieri (keyboards) and Stefano Olivato (bass and harmonica), or with Ellade Bandini (drums) and Maurizio Fabrizio (guitars and keyboards).

<doc id="926215" wikidata="Q5378667" url="?curid=926215" title="English ship Vanguard (1586)">
<text>Vanguard was a 32-gun galleon of the English Tudor navy, launched in 1586 from Woolwich, and was the first ship of the navy to bear the name.

She played a key part in the action against the Spanish Armada in 1588.

George Beeston anchored the ship in the Forth at Leith on 1 June 1589. One of his crew, the trumpeter, was killed ashore in Edinburgh in a fight with Spanish sailors.

She was commanded by Martin Frobisher in 1594 and by Sir Robert Mansell in 1596.

She was taken to pieces in 1599 and rebuilt for the first time. In 1615 she was rebuilt for a second time, at Chatham, as a great ship.

During actions against Algerian pirates in 1620, &quot;Vanguard&quot; flew the flag of Sir Richard Hawkins.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; was broken up in 1630. Some of her timbers were used in the construction of the next , launched the following year, and officially recorded as a rebuild of the first &quot;Vanguard&quot;.

<text>Todd R. Wagner (born August 2, 1960) is an American entrepreneur, co-founder of Broadcast.com and founder and CEO of a company called Charity Network which organizes regular fund raisings. He also co-owns 2929 Entertainment with Mark Cuban, along with other entertainment companies.

== Early life ==
Wagner was born in Gary, Indiana. He attended Merrillville High School and then Indiana University, joining Kappa Sigma fraternity Beta Theta chapter.

He graduated from Indiana University in 1983. He earned a J.D. from University of Virginia, then moved to Dallas, Texas, where he became a licensed CPA. He began a legal career with the national firms Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld and Hopkins &amp; Sutter.

== Career ==

=== Broadcast.com ===
In 1995, Wagner launched AudioNet with Mark Cuban, a platform for broadcasting live sporting events and radio stations over the internet. As CEO, Wagner grew the company and expanded its services to include corporate events and business services.

In 1998 Wagner and Cuban changed the name to Broadcast.com and took the company public in the midst of the dot-com boom. The Broadcast.com IPO set an opening-day record, with shares climbing 249% from an offering price of $18 to a closing price of $62.75.

In 1999, Wagner and Cuban sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo! for $5.7 billion, making 300 employees millionaires (briefly, on paper) and Wagner and Cuban instant billionaires. Wagner continued to lead the division as Yahoo! Broadcast until May 2000, when he declined an offer to become Yahoo!&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer to focus on other interests.

=== 2929 Entertainment ===
Using the success of Broadcast.com, Wagner built the Wagner/Cuban Companies including 2929 Productions. Two films the company helped produce received Oscar nominations: (&quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; and &quot;&quot;). Other films include &quot;Akeelah and the Bee&quot; and &quot;The Road&quot;. &quot;Good Night&quot;, directed by and co-starring George Clooney, was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture.

Through 2929 Entertainment, Wagner and Mark Cuban have owned a group of vertically integrated entertainment properties including high-definition production company HDNet Films (produced the Academy Awardânominated documentary &quot;Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room&quot;); distributor Magnolia Pictures (released &quot;Enron&quot; and Oscar-nominated &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot;); home video division Magnolia Home Entertainment; the Landmark Theatres art-house chain which was sold in 2018; and high-definition cable channels HDNet and HDNet Movies now AXS TV.

=== Other business ventures ===
Wagner also has a stake in the Dallas Mavericks, and he continues to invest in and nurture start-ups. Additionally, Wagner and Mark Cuban were the original investors in Content Partners LLC, a company that invests in the back-end profit participations of Hollywood talent. As of 2019, Wagner remained an equity partner.

Additionally Wagner serves on the American Film Institute&#x27;s Board of Trustees.

In June 2015, it was announced that Wagner had acquired the celebrity charitable fundraising platform Prizeo for an undisclosed sum.

Toddâs latest project is FoodFight USA, a nationwide grassroots campaign to clean up Americaâs tainted food supply. In an early win, Todd&#x27;s influence was behind the passing of the California Food Safety Act in October 2023.

=== Charity Network ===
In 2014, Wagner launched Chideo, a digital platform designed to raise funds and awareness for causes by connecting fans to celebrities through exclusive video content. Over the next two years, Wagner expanded the concept through the acquisition of online sweepstakes platform Prizeo in June 2015, and online charity auction site Charitybuzz in October 2015.

In 2016, Wagner announced the formation of Charity Network, parent company to Charitybuzz, Prizeo and Chideo, with a mission to help charities transition from analog to digital. The company uses celebrities, technology and the media to raise awareness for its customers.

In February 2017, Charity Network was named one of Fast Company&#x27;s 2017 Most Innovative Companies by a website called Fast Company.

<text>Ancient Greek literature is literature written in the Ancient Greek language from the earliest texts until the time of the Byzantine Empire. The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early Archaic period, are the two epic poems the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, set in an idealized archaic past today identified as having some relation to the Mycenaean era. These two epics, along with the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; and the two poems of Hesiod, the &quot;Theogony&quot; and &quot;Works and Days&quot;, constituted the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods.

The lyric poets Sappho, Alcaeus, and Pindar were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition. Aeschylus is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete. Sophocles is famous for his tragedies about Oedipus, particularly &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;. Euripides is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre. The comedic playwright Aristophanes wrote in the genre of Old Comedy, while the later playwright Menander was an early pioneer of New Comedy. The historians Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides, who both lived during the fifth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes. The philosopher Plato wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher Socrates, dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student Aristotle wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential.

Important later writers included Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote &quot;The Argonautica&quot;, an epic poem about the voyage of the Argonauts; Archimedes, who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and Plutarch, who wrote mainly biographies and essays. The second-century AD writer Lucian of Samosata was a Greek, who wrote primarily works of satire. Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later Greek literature and also western literature at large. In particular, many ancient Roman authors drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors. Ever since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and James Joyce, have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs.

== Pre-classical and classical antiquity ==

This period of Greek literature stretches from Homer until the fourth century BC and the rise of Alexander the Great. The earliest known Greek writings are Mycenaean, written in the Linear B syllabary on clay tablets. These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade (lists, inventories, receipts, etc.); no real literature has been discovered. Michael Ventris and John Chadwick, the original decipherers of Linear B, state that literature almost certainly existed in Mycenaean Greece, but it was either not written down or, if it was, it was on parchment or wooden tablets, which did not survive the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces in the twelfth century BC.

Greek literature was divided into well-defined literary genres, each one having a compulsory formal structure, about both dialect and metrics. The first division was between prose and poetry. Within poetry there were three super-genres: epic, lyric and drama. The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology. Lyric and drama were further divided into more genres: lyric in four (elegiac, iambic, monodic lyric and choral lyric); drama in three (tragedy, comedy and pastoral drama). Prose literature can largely be said to begin with Herodotus. Over time, several genres of prose literature developed, but the distinctions between them were frequently blurred.

Among the found papyri, the most frequently found are the works of Homer, in 1680 fragments, Demosthenes, 204 fragments, and Euripides, 170 papyri.

=== Epic poetry ===
At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The figure of Homer is shrouded in mystery. Although the works as they now stand are credited to him, it is certain that their roots reach far back before his time (see Homeric Question). The &quot;Iliad&quot; is a narrative of a single episode spanning over the course of a ten-day-period from near the end of the ten years of the Trojan War. It centers on the person of Achilles, who embodied the Greek heroic ideal.
The &quot;Odyssey&quot; is an account of the adventures of Odysseus, one of the warriors at Troy. After ten years fighting the war, he spends another ten years sailing back home to his wife and family. Penelope was considered the ideal female; Homer depicted her as the ideal female based on her commitment, modesty, purity, and respect during her marriage to Odysseus. During his ten-year voyage, he loses all of his comrades and ships and makes his way home to Ithaca disguised as a beggar. Both of these works were based on ancient legends. The Homeric dialect was an archaic language based on Ionic dialect mixed with some element of Aeolic dialect and Attic dialect, the latter due to the Athenian edition of the 6th century BC. The epic verse was the hexameter.

The other great poet of the preclassical period was Hesiod. Unlike Homer, Hesiod refers to himself in his poetry. Nonetheless, nothing is known about him from any external source. He was a native of Boeotia in central Greece, and is thought to have lived and worked around 700 BC. Hesiod&#x27;s two extant poems are &quot;Works and Days&quot; and the &quot;Theogony&quot;. &quot;Works and Days&quot; is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past Golden Age. The &quot;Theogony&quot; is a systematic account of creation and of the gods.

The writings of Homer and Hesiod were held in extremely high regard throughout antiquity and were viewed by many ancient authors as the foundational texts behind ancient Greek religion; Homer told the story of a heroic past, which Hesiod bracketed with a creation narrative and an account of the practical realities of contemporary daily life.

=== Lyric poetry ===

Lyric poetry received its name from the fact that it was originally sung by individuals or a chorus accompanied by the instrument called the lyre. Despite the name, the lyric poetry in this general meaning was divided in four genres, two of which were not accompanied by cithara, but by flute. These two latter genres were elegiac poetry and iambic poetry. Both were written in the Ionic dialect. Elegiac poems were written in elegiac couplets and iambic poems were written in iambic trimeter. The first of the lyric poets was probably Archilochus of Paros, 7th century BC, the most important iambic poet. Only fragments remain of his work, as is the case with most of the poets. The few remnants suggest that he was an embittered adventurer who led a very turbulent life.

Many lyric poems were written in the Aeolic dialect. Lyric poems often employed highly varied poetic meters. The most famous of all lyric poets were the so-called &quot;Nine Lyric Poets&quot;. Of all the lyric poets, Sappho of Lesbos (c. 630 â c. 570 BC) was by far the most widely revered. In antiquity, her poems were regarded with the same degree of respect as the poems of Homer. Only one of her poems, &quot;Ode to Aphrodite&quot;, has survived to the present day in its original, completed form. In addition to Sappho, her contemporary Alcaeus of Lesbos was also notable for monodic lyric poetry. The poetry written by Alcman was considered beautiful, even though he wrote exclusively in the Doric dialect, which was normally considered unpleasant to hear. The later poet Pindar of Thebes was renowned for his choral lyric poetry.

=== Drama ===
All surviving works of Greek drama were composed by playwrights from Athens and are written exclusively in the Attic dialect. Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states. The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus. Later playwrights expanded the number of actors to three, allowing for greater freedom in storytelling.

In the age that followed the Greco-Persian Wars, the awakened national spirit of Athens was expressed in hundreds of tragedies based on heroic and legendary themes of the past. The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god Dionysus. In the classical period, performances included three tragedies and one pastoral drama, depicting four different episodes of the same myth. Wealthy citizens were chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and religious duty. Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act of worship. Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in Athens. The poets competed for the prizes offered for the best plays.

All fully surviving Greek tragedies are conventionally attributed to Aeschylus, Sophocles or Euripides. The authorship of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, which is traditionally attributed to Aeschylus, and &quot;Rhesus&quot;, which is traditionally attributed to Euripides, are, however, questioned. There are seven surviving tragedies attributed to Aeschylus. Three of these plays, &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, &quot;The Libation-Bearers&quot;, and &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, form a trilogy known as the &quot;Oresteia&quot;. One of these plays, &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, however, may actually be the work of Aeschylus&#x27;s son Euphorion.

Seven works of Sophocles have survived, the most acclaimed of which are the three Theban plays, which center around the story of Oedipus and his offspring. The Theban Trilogy consists of &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;, &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, and &quot;Antigone&quot;. Although the plays are often called a &quot;trilogy,&quot; they were written many years apart. &quot;Antigone&quot;, the last of the three plays sequentially, was actually first to be written, having been composed in 441 BC, towards the beginning of Sophocles&#x27;s career. &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;, the most famous of the three, was written around 429 BC at the midpoint of Sophocles&#x27;s career. &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, the second of the three plays chronologically, was actually Sophocles&#x27;s last play and was performed in 401 BC, after Sophocles&#x27;s death.

There are nineteen surviving plays attributed to Euripides. The most well-known of these plays are &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, and &quot;Bacchae&quot;. &quot;Rhesus&quot; is sometimes thought to have been written by Euripides&#x27; son, or to have been a posthumous reproduction of a play by Euripides. Euripides pushed the limits of the tragic genre and many of the elements in his plays were more typical of comedy than tragedy. His play &quot;Alcestis&quot;, for instance, has often been categorized as a &quot;problem play&quot; or perhaps even as a work of tragicomedy rather than a true tragedy due to its comedic elements and the fact that it has a happy ending.

Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At Athens, the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works remain of the great comedic writers. The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun at everyone and every institution. In &quot;The Birds&quot;, he ridicules Athenian democracy. In &quot;The Clouds&quot;, he attacks the philosopher Socrates. In &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, he denounces war. Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry. John LempriÃ¨re&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Classica&quot; describes him as, quite simply, &quot;the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side MoliÃ¨re seems dull and Shakespeare clownish.&quot; Of all Aristophanes&#x27;s plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is &quot;The Frogs&quot;, which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides. When it was performed for the first time at the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize. It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia. Even today, &quot;The Frogs&quot; still appeals to modern audiences. A commercially successful modern musical adaptation of it was performed on Broadway in 2004.

The third dramatic genre was the satyr play. Although the genre was popular, only one complete example of a satyr play has survived: &quot;Cyclops&quot; by Euripides. Large portions of a second satyr play, &quot;Ichneutae&quot; by Sophocles, have been recovered from the site of Oxyrhynchus in Egypt among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri.

=== Historiography ===
Two notable historians who lived during the Classical Era were Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called &quot;The Father of History.&quot; His book &quot;The Histories&quot; is among the oldest works of prose literature in existence. Thucydides&#x27;s book &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; greatly influenced later writers and historians, including the author of the book of Acts of the Apostles and the Byzantine Era historian Procopius of Caesarea.

A third historian of ancient Greece, Xenophon of Athens, began his &quot;Hellenica&quot; where Thucydides ended his work about 411 BC and carried his history to 362 BC. Xenophon&#x27;s most famous work is his book &quot;The Anabasis&quot;, a detailed, first-hand account of his participation in a Greek mercenary army that tried to help the Persian Cyrus expel his brother from the throne, another famous work relating to Persian history is his &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;. Xenophon also wrote three works in praise of the philosopher Socrates: &quot;The Apology of Socrates to the Jury&quot;, &quot;The Symposium&quot;, and &quot;Memorabilia&quot;. Although both Xenophon and Plato knew Socrates, their accounts are very different. Many comparisons have been made between the account of the military historian and the account of the poet-philosopher.

=== Philosophy ===

Many important and influential philosophers lived during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Among the earliest Greek philosophers were the three so-called &quot;Milesian philosophers&quot;: Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, and Anaximenes. Of these philosophers&#x27; writings, however, only one fragment from Anaximander preserved by Simplicius of Cilicia has survived.

Very little is known for certain about the life of the philosopher Pythagoras of Samos and no writings by him have survived to the present day, but an impressive corpus of poetic writings written by his pupil Empedocles of Acragas has survived, making Empedocles one of the most widely attested Pre-Socratic philosophers. A large number of fragments written by the philosophers Heraclitus of Ephesus and Democritus of Abdera have also survived.

Of all the classical philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally considered the most important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato&#x27;s portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato&#x27;s early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato&#x27;s portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato&#x27;s own opinions who has very little to do with the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato&#x27;s portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates&#x27;s ideas is known as the Socratic problem.
Plato expressed his ideas through dialogues, that is, written works purporting to describe conversations between different individuals. Some of the best-known of these include: &quot;The Apology of Socrates&quot;, a purported record of the speech Socrates gave at his trial; &quot;Phaedo&quot;, a description of the last conversation between Socrates and his disciples before his execution; &quot;The Symposium&quot;, a dialogue over the nature of love; and &quot;The Republic&quot;, widely regarded as Plato&#x27;s most important work, a long dialogue describing the ideal government.

Aristotle of Stagira is widely considered to be one of the most important and influential philosophical thinkers of all time. The first sentence of his &quot;Metaphysics&quot; reads: &quot;All men by nature desire to know.&quot; He has, therefore, been called the &quot;Father of those who know.&quot; His medieval disciple Thomas Aquinas referred to him simply as &quot;the Philosopher&quot;. Aristotle was a student at Plato&#x27;s Academy, and like his teacher, he wrote dialogues, or conversations. However, none of these exist today. The body of writings that have come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the Lyceum. Even from these books, the enormous range of his interests is evident: He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical; the extant treatises cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government. Among Aristotle&#x27;s most notable works are &quot;Politics&quot;, &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, &quot;Poetics&quot;, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, and &quot;Rhetoric&quot;.

== Hellenistic period ==


By 338 BC all of the Greek city-states except Sparta had been united by Philip II of Macedon. Philip&#x27;s son Alexander the Great extended his father&#x27;s conquests greatly. Athens lost its preeminent status as the leader of Greek culture, and it was replaced temporarily by Alexandria, Egypt.

The city of Alexandria in northern Egypt became, from the 3rd century BC, the outstanding center of Greek culture. It also soon attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish scholarship in the ancient world. The Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible was reputed to have been initiated in Alexandria. Philo, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, operated out of Alexandria at the turn of the Common Era. In addition, it later became a major focal point for the development of Christian thought. The Musaeum, or Shrine to the Muses, which included the library and school, was founded by Ptolemy I. The institution was from the beginning intended as a great international school and library. The library, eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek. It was intended to serve as a repository for every work of classical Greek literature that could be found.

=== Poetry ===
The genre of bucolic poetry was first developed by the poet Theocritus. The Roman Virgil later wrote his &quot;Eclogues&quot; in this genre. Callimachus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria, composed the &quot;Aetia&quot; (&quot;Causes&quot;), a long poem written in four volumes of elegiac couplets describing the legendary origins of obscure customs, festivals, and names, which he probably wrote in several stages over the course of many years in the third century BC. The &quot;Aetia&quot; was lost during the Middle Ages, but, over the course of the twentieth century, much of it was recovered due to new discoveries of ancient papyri. Scholars initially denigrated it as &quot;second-rate&quot;, showing great learning, but lacking true &quot;art&quot;. Over the course of the century, scholarly appraisal of it greatly improved, with many scholars now seeing it in a much more positive light. Callimachus also wrote short poems for special occasions and at least one short epic, the &quot;Ibis&quot;, which was directed against his former pupil Apollonius. He also compiled a prose treatise entitled the &quot;Pinakes&quot;, in which he catalogued all the major works held in the Library of Alexandria.

The Alexandrian poet Apollonius of Rhodes is best known for his epic poem the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, which narrates the adventures of Jason and his shipmates the Argonauts on their quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece from the land of Colchis. The poet Aratus wrote the hexameter poem &quot;Phaenomena&quot;, a poetic rendition of Eudoxus of Cnidus&#x27;s treatise on the stars written in the fourth century BC.

=== Drama ===
During the Hellenistic period, the Old Comedy of the Classical Era was replaced by New Comedy. The most notable writer of New Comedy was the Athenian playwright Menander. None of Menander&#x27;s plays have survived to the present day in their complete form, but one play, &quot;The Bad-Tempered Man&quot;, has survived to the present day in a near-complete form. Most of another play entitled &quot;The Girl from Samos&quot; and large portions of another five have also survived.

=== Historiography ===

The historian Timaeus was born in Sicily but spent most of his life in Athens. His &quot;History&quot;, though lost, is significant because of its influence on Polybius. In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 264 BC, which is where Polybius begins his work. Timaeus also wrote the &quot;Olympionikai&quot;, a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games.

===Ancient biography===

Ancient biography, or &quot;bios&quot;, as distinct from modern biography, was a genre of Greek (and Roman) literature interested in describing the goals, achievements, failures, and character of ancient historical persons and whether or not they should be imitated. Authors of ancient &quot;bios&quot;, such as the works of Nepos and Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; imitated many of the same sources and techniques of the contemporary historiographies of ancient Greece, notably including the works of Herodotus and Thucydides. There were various forms of ancient biographies, including philosophical biographies that brought out the moral character of their subject (such as Diogenes Laertius&#x27;s &quot;Lives of Eminent Philosophers&quot;), literary biographies which discussed the lives of orators and poets (such as Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot;), school and reference biographies that offered a short sketch of someone including their ancestry, major events and accomplishments, and death, autobiographies, commentaries and memoirs where the subject presents his own life, and historical/political biography focusing on the lives of those active in the military, among other categories.

=== Science and mathematics ===

Eratosthenes of Alexandria ( 276 BC â â195/194 BC), wrote on astronomy and geography, but his work is known mainly from later summaries. He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth&#x27;s circumference. Much that was written by the mathematicians Euclid and Archimedes has been preserved. Euclid is known for his &quot;Elements&quot;, much of which was drawn from his predecessor Eudoxus of Cnidus. The &quot;Elements&quot; is a treatise on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics. From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the present. Among them are &quot;Measurement of the Circle&quot;, in which he worked out the value of pi; &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;, on his work in mechanics; &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;; and &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;. A manuscript of his works is currently being studied.

=== Prose fiction ===

Very little has survived of prose fiction from the Hellenistic Era. &quot;The Milesiaka&quot; by Aristides of Miletos was probably written during the second century BC. &quot;The Milesiaka&quot; itself has not survived to the present day in its complete form, but various references to it have survived. The book established a whole new genre of so-called &quot;Milesian tales,&quot; of which &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by the later Roman writer Apuleius is a prime example.

The ancient Greek novels &quot;Chaereas and Callirhoe&quot; by Chariton and &quot;Metiochus and Parthenope&quot; were probably both written during the late first century BC or early first century AD, during the latter part of the Hellenistic Era. The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos&#x27;s &quot;Phoenician Tale&quot; reveal the existence of a genre of ancient Greek picaresque novel.

== Roman period ==

While the transition from city-state to empire affected philosophy a great deal, shifting the emphasis from political theory to personal ethics, Greek letters continued to flourish both under the Successors (especially the Ptolemies) and under Roman rule. Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well. A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The New Testament, written by various authors in varying qualities of Koine Greek also hails from this period, the most important works being the Gospels and the Epistles of Saint Paul.

=== Poetry ===
The poet Quintus of Smyrna, who probably lived during the late fourth century AD, wrote &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, an epic poem narrating the story of the fall of Troy, beginning where the &quot;Iliad&quot; left off. About the same time and in a similar Homeric style, an unknown poet composed the &quot;Blemyomachia&quot;, a now fragmentary epic about conflict between Romans and Blemmyes.

The poet Nonnus of Panopolis wrote the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, the longest surviving epic poem from antiquity. He also wrote a poetic paraphrase of The Gospel of John. Nonnus probably lived sometime during the late fourth century AD or early fifth century AD.

=== Historiography ===
The historian Polybius was born about 200 BC. He was brought to Rome as a hostage in 168. In Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus. He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars against Carthage. He was with Scipio at the destruction of Carthage in 146.

Diodorus Siculus was a Greek historian who lived in the 1st century BC, around the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He wrote a universal history, &quot;Bibliotheca Historica&quot;, in 40 books. Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th remain. The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era. The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar&#x27;s wars in Gaul, now France. Dionysius of Halicarnassus lived late in the first century BC. His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched. He also wrote a number of other treatises, including &quot;On Imitation&quot;, &quot;Commentaries on the Ancient Orators&quot;, and &quot;On the Arrangement of Words&quot;.

The historians Appian of Alexandria and Arrian of Nicomedia both lived in the second century AD. Appian wrote on Rome and its conquests, while Arrian is remembered for his work on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Arrian served in the Roman army. His book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander&#x27;s life. Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the &quot;Diatribai&quot;, based on the teachings of his mentor Epictetus.

Best known of the late Greek historians to modern readers is Plutarch of Chaeronea, who died about AD 119. His &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; of great Greek and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first published. His other surviving work is the &quot;Moralia&quot;, a collection of essays on ethical, religious, political, physical, and literary topics.

During later times, so-called &quot;commonplace books,&quot; usually describing historical anecdotes, became quite popular. Surviving examples of this popular genre include works such as Aulus Gellius&#x27;s &quot;Attic Nights&quot;, Athenaeus of Naucratis&#x27;s &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;, and Claudius Aelianus&#x27;s &quot;De Natura Animalium&quot; and &quot;Varia Historia&quot;.

=== Science and mathematics ===

The physician Galen lived during the 2nd century AD. He was a careful student of anatomy, and his works exerted a powerful influence on medicine for the next 1,400 years. Strabo, who died about AD 23, was a geographer and historian. His &quot;Historical Sketches&quot; in 47 volumes has nearly all been lost. His &quot;Geographical Sketches&quot; remains the only existing ancient book covering the whole range of people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans through the time of Augustus. Pausanias, who lived in the 2nd century AD, was also a geographer. His &quot;Description of Greece&quot; is a travel guide describing the geography and mythic history of Greece during the second century. The book takes the form of a tour of Greece, starting in Athens and ending in Naupactus.

The scientist of the Roman period who had the greatest influence on later generations was undoubtedly the astronomer Ptolemy. He lived during the 2nd century AD, though little is known of his life. His masterpiece, originally entitled &quot;The Mathematical Collection&quot;, has come to the present under the title &quot;Almagest&quot;, as it was translated by Arab astronomers with that title. It was Ptolemy who devised a detailed description of an Earth-centered universe, a notion that dominated astronomical thinking for more than 1,300 years. The Ptolemaic view of the universe endured until Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and other early modern astronomers replaced it with heliocentrism.

=== Philosophy ===

Epictetus ( 55 AD â 135 AD) was associated with the moral philosophy of the Stoics. His teachings were collected by his pupil Arrian in the &quot;Discourses&quot; and the &quot;Encheiridion&quot; (Manual of Study).

Diogenes LaÃ«rtius, who lived in the third century AD, wrote &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, a voluminous collection of biographies of nearly every Greek philosopher who ever lived. Unfortunately, Diogenes LaÃ«rtius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable. Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers. His book is not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved. His biography of Epicurus, for instance, is of particularly high quality and contains three lengthy letters attributed to Epicurus himself, at least two of which are generally agreed to be authentic.

Another major philosopher of his period was Plotinus. He transformed Plato&#x27;s philosophy into a school called Neoplatonism. His &quot;Enneads&quot; had a wide-ranging influence on European thought until at least the seventeenth century. Plotinus&#x27;s philosophy mainly revolved around the concepts of &quot;nous&quot;, &quot;psyche&quot;, and the &quot;One.&quot;

After the rise of Christianity, many of the most important philosophers were Christians. The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who wrote exclusively in Greek, made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy, especially Platonism. Origen of Alexandria, the founder of Christian theology, also made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy and was even able to hold his own against the pagan philosopher Celsus in his apologetic treatise &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;.

=== Prose fiction ===
The Roman Period was the time when the majority of extant works of Greek prose fiction were composed. The ancient Greek novels &quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot; by Achilles Tatius and &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; by Longus were both probably written during the early second century AD. &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;, by far the most famous of the five surviving ancient Greek romance novels, is a nostalgic tale of two young lovers growing up in an idealized pastoral environment on the Greek island of Lesbos. &quot;The Wonders Beyond Thule&quot; by Antonius Diogenes may have also been written during the early second century AD, although scholars are unsure of its exact date. &quot;The Wonders Beyond Thule&quot; has not survived in its complete form, but a very lengthy summary of it written by Photios I of Constantinople has survived. &quot;The Ephesian Tale&quot; by Xenophon of Ephesus was probably written during the late second century AD.

The satirist Lucian of Samosata lived during the late second century AD. Lucian&#x27;s works were incredibly popular during antiquity. Over eighty different writings attributed to Lucian have survived to the present day. Almost all of Lucian&#x27;s works are written in the heavily Atticized dialect of ancient Greek language prevalent among the well-educated at the time. His book &quot;The Syrian Goddess&quot;, however, was written in a faux-Ionic dialect, deliberately imitating the dialect and style of Herodotus. Lucian&#x27;s most famous work is the novel &quot;A True Story&quot;, which some authors have described as the earliest surviving work of science fiction. His dialogue &quot;The Lover of Lies&quot; contains several of the earliest known ghost stories as well as the earliest known version of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice.&quot; His letter &quot;The Passing of Peregrinus&quot;, a ruthless satire against Christians, contains one of the earliest pagan appraisals of early Christianity.

&quot;The Aethiopica&quot; by Heliodorus of Emesa was probably written during the third century AD. It tells the story of a young Ethiopian princess named Chariclea, who is estranged from her family and goes on many misadventures across the known world. Of all the ancient Greek novels, the one that attained the greatest level of popularity was the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;, a fictionalized account of the exploits of Alexander the Great written in the third century AD. Eighty versions of it have survived in twenty-four different languages, attesting that, during the Middle Ages, the novel was nearly as popular as the Bible. Versions of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; were so commonplace in the fourteenth century that Geoffrey Chaucer wrote that &quot;...every wight that hath discrecioun / Hath herd somwhat or al of [Alexander&#x27;s] fortune.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Ancient Greek literature has had an enormous impact on western literature as a whole. Ancient Roman authors adopted various styles and motifs from ancient Greek literature. These ideas were later, in turn, adopted by other western European writers and literary critics. Ancient Greek literature especially influenced later Greek literature. For instance, the Greek novels influenced the later work &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;, written by Musaeus Grammaticus. Ancient Roman writers were acutely aware of the ancient Greek literary legacy and many deliberately emulated the style and formula of Greek classics in their own works. The Roman poet Vergil, for instance, modeled his epic poem the &quot;Aeneid&quot; on the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

During the Middle Ages, ancient Greek literature was largely forgotten in Western Europe. The medieval writer Roger Bacon wrote that &quot;there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars.&quot; It was not until the Renaissance that Greek writings were rediscovered by western European scholars. During the Renaissance, Greek began to be taught in western European colleges and universities for the first time, which resulted in western European scholars rediscovering the literature of ancient Greece. The &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, the first New Testament printed in the original Greek, was published in 1516 by the Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus. Erasmus also published Latin translations of classical Greek texts, including a Latin translation of Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;.
The influence of classical Greek literature on modern literature is also evident. Numerous figures from classical literature and mythology appear throughout &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri. Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; were a major influence on William Shakespeare and served as the main source behind his tragedies &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies &quot;A Comedy of Errors&quot; and &quot;The Twelfth Night&quot; drew heavily on themes from Graeco-Roman New Comedy. Meanwhile, Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; was inspired by a story written by Lucian and his comedy &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; was based on an adaptation of the ancient Greek novel &quot;Apollonius of Tyre&quot; found in John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;.

John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is written using a similar style to the two Homeric epics. It also makes frequent allusions to figures from classical literature and mythology, using them as symbols to convey a Christian message. Lucian&#x27;s &quot;A True Story&quot; was part of the inspiration for Jonathan Swift&#x27;s novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;, a book on Greek mythology published in 1867 and aimed at a popular audience, was described by Carl J. Richard as &quot;one of the most popular books ever published in the United States&quot;.

George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; is a modern, rationalized retelling of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion. James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, heralded by critics as one of the greatest works of modern literature, is a retelling of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; set in modern-day Dublin. The mid-twentieth-century British author Mary Renault wrote a number of critically acclaimed novels inspired by ancient Greek literature and mythology, including &quot;The Last of the Wine&quot; and &quot;The King Must Die&quot;.

Even in works that do not consciously draw on Graeco-Roman literature, authors often employ concepts and themes originating in ancient Greece. The ideas expressed in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics. A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the &quot;Poetics&quot; by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages. Common Greek literary terms still used today include: &quot;catharsis&quot;, &quot;ethos&quot;, &quot;anagnorisis&quot;, &quot;hamartia&quot;, &quot;hubris&quot;, &quot;mimesis&quot;, &quot;mythos&quot;, &quot;nemesis&quot;, and &quot;peripeteia&quot;.

<doc id="926223" wikidata="Q5634802" url="?curid=926223" title="English ship Vanguard (1631)">
<text>Vanguard was a 40-gun ship of the English Royal Navy, launched in 1631 at Woolwich, and was the second vessel to bear the name. Officially she was rebuilt from the first &quot;Vanguard&quot;, but likely only shared some of the timber and fittings from the previous ship. By 1660, her armament had been increased to 56 guns.

She took part in both the First and Second Dutch Wars. The ship served as the flagship for General at Sea George Monck at the Battle of Portland in 1653, and of Vice-Admiral Joseph Jordan at the Battle of the Gabbard and the Battle of Scheveningen later the same year. She also took part in several actions of the Second Dutch War, including the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665 and the Four Days Battle and St James&#x27;s Day Fight in 1666. In 1667 &quot;Vanguard&quot; was scuttled to form a barrier in the River Medway to prevent the Dutch fleet from capturing or burning the British ships there. She was subsequently sold.

<text>East End Park is an inner city area of east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is situated between Burmantofts to the north west, Harehills to the north east (although not a direct neighbour), Halton Moor to the east, Richmond Hill to the west and Cross Green to the south west. It blends into the Halton Moor/Osmondthorpe area and is 1 mile to the east of Leeds city centre in the LS9 Leeds postcode area.

==General description==
The area is situated in the vicinity of the A64 York Road, east Leeds&#x27; main thoroughfare, and is also home to a large park dating back from Victorian times which was purchased by Leeds City Council in the late 19th century, when it was waste land. Housing in the area is made up of nineteenth-century through terraced housing, some back-to-back terraced housing. Semi-detached and detached houses are also found in the area.
Many of the back-to-back terraced houses in the area were due to be demolished as part of the Â£1.3Â billion &quot;EASEL&quot; regeneration scheme in east and south-east Leeds. However these plans were withdrawn in 2010 with Leeds City Council citing the recession debilitating the private sector&#x27;s ability to build as the main reason.
Crime is unevenly distributed across East End Park. The Glensdales, Templeviews and Charltons are a small cluster of predominately back-to-back streets noted for the majority of the area&#x27;s crime and have subsequently become a priority area of West Yorkshire Police, crime in the rest of the estate is much less common. The same group of streets are a focus of some regeneration in the area.

The area is home to one of the major Irish communities in Leeds, and is home to the prestigious music venue &#x27;Leeds Irish Centre&#x27;, the first purpose built Irish Centre in Britain. The centre opened on 20 January 1970, although the official opening ceremony was held on 8 June 1970. A blue plaque calls it &quot;The Crucible of Darts&quot;, being the location for televised darts matches in 1973. There also a Buddhist temple in a former school by the park.

== The Park ==
East End Park was originally part of the grounds of a mansion, Osmondthorpe Hall (destroyed by fire in 1924), sold to the city in 1886. It is now managed by Parks and Countryside, part of the Learning and Leisure Department, 
Leeds City Council. It offers has bowling greens, tennis courts, football pitches and a basketball court. There are plenty of open spaces in the park and areas of well established woodland. There are also seating areas amongst rose and shrub beds. The park hosts many events throughout the year including an annual bonfire and fun fair which attracts up to 10,000 visitors. A tennis camp is held each August for young people.

In March 2009, Trees for Cities and Leeds City Council planted 3,000 whips at East End Park in order to create new areas of urban woodland to help screen the park from the railway line that runs behind it. The planting follows planting in 2007 when, with the help of the local community, 18 large trees were planted to replace those lost in September 2006 when a freak tornado struck the city.
==Transport==
East End Park is situated in the vicinity of the A64 York Road, east Leeds&#x27; main thoroughfare, providing the area with a well established and reliable bus service. Most bus routes are operated by First Leeds and Arriva Yorkshire. The 19 and 19A run to Garforth, Colton, Halton, the city centre, Headingley, West Park, Ireland Wood and Tinshill. The 5 runs to Halton Moor, Osmondthorpe and the city centre. The 40 and 40A run to Seacroft, Swarcliffe, Cross Gates, Halton and the city centre. The 56 runs to Whinmoor, Seacroft, Killingbeck, Hyde Park, the University of Leeds, Headingley and Moor Grange. The 163 and 166 run from the city centre to Castleford, as well as services that run along the A64 to the east coast. 
The closest railway station is Leeds railway station.

<text>Weetwood is an area between Headingley and Meanwood in north-west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is bounded on the north by the A6120 (Outer Ring Road), on the west by the A660 (Otley Road), on the east by Meanwood Beck and to the south by Hollin Lane. Weetwood Lane runs north and south through it.

The area lends its name to and sits in the Weetwood ward of Leeds City Council, which is also part of Leeds Central and Headingley parliamentary constituency.

==Politics==
The Weetwood ward for local government purposes includes areas known as Far Headingley (south of the above), West Park (west of the A660), Ireland Wood (north of the A6120), and Tinshill. Its three Leeds City Councillors and the terms for which they are currently elected, are Izaak Wilson (Labour Party, 2022â2026), Jools Heselwood (Labour Party, 2023â2027) and Emma Flint (Labour Party, 2024â2028). The population of this ward was 22,375 at the 2011 Census.

Weetwood is part of the Leeds Central and Headingley parliamentary constituency, and its MP is Alex Sobel (Labour Party).

==History==
The name (earlier Wetewode) means the wet wood to the west of Meanwood Beck. The main activities of the area were quarrying the sandstone which underlies it and charcoal burning and later iron smelting in bloomery furnaces which occurred from 1240 to 1550. For most of this time the land was owned by Kirkstall monastery. Following the dissolution of the monasteries, the area went into private hands, notably the Foxcroft family who held it from 1583 until 1741, building a manor house, Weetwood Hall in 1625. The Meanwood Beck provided power for Weetwood mill and Walley&#x27;s tannery from 1656 to 1820.
In the Middle Ages Weetwood Lane was the principal route between Adel and Leeds, and particularly to the market in Headingley. The construction of the Leeds to Otley Turnpike (now the A660 Otley Road) in 1741 provided a faster link so that residences began to be built, particularly after 1840. In June 1853 Ann Husler inherited Weetwood Quarry from her husband, and ran it successfully until her death in 1874.

==Buildings==
===Weetwood Hall===
Weetwood Hall is now a hotel and conference centre, which includes a manor house and buildings of the same name dating back to 1625. It is a Grade II* Listed building of local gritstone ashlar. The porch is of Classical design, with widely spaced Ionic columns, and the interior has elaborately plastered ceilings. It was taken over by the University of Leeds in 1919 and was a hall of residence until 1993, when it took on its present role after extensive re-development.

===Fox Hill===
Fox Hill is the name of a hill, a hall which stands on it, and a residential area within Weetwood. The hall was built in 1863 for the Tetley family of Tetley&#x27;s Brewery. It is now Moorlands School. Fox hill also includes other Grade II Listed buildings, Weetwood Grange (1861), now flats, and Weetwood Croft (1898) now a university student residence, Oxley Hall.

<doc id="926233" wikidata="Q5634803" url="?curid=926233" title="HMS Vanguard (1678)">
<text>HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; was a 90-gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built at Portsmouth Dockyard and launched in 1678.

She ran onto Goodwin Sands in 1690, but was fortunate enough to be hauled off by the boatmen of Deal.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; took part in the Battle of Barfleur as part of Edward Russell&#x27;s fleet, and then in the following action at La Hougue when French ships were burned in 1692.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; sank in the Great Storm of 1703, while laid up in ordinary at Chatham Dockyard, but was raised in 1704 for rebuilding. She was relaunched from Chatham on 2 August 1710 as a 90-gun second rate built to the 1706 Establishment. In 1739 she was renamed HMS &quot;Duke&quot;, and rebuilt for a second time at Woolwich as a 90-gun second rate. She was rebuilt according to the 1733 proposals of the 1719 Establishment, and relaunched on 28 April 1739.

In 1759, &quot;Duke&quot;, with a ship&#x27;s complement of 800 souls under the command of Captain Samuel Graves, saw action during the Battle of Quiberon Bay.

&quot;Duke&quot; was broken up in 1769.

<text>Kim Jeong-ho (; 1804â1866?) was a Korean geographer and cartographer. His art name was Gosanja (). He was born in Hwanghaedo. It is believed that he walked the entire length and breadth of the Korean peninsula, through mountain and valley, in order to research and compile his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the &quot;Daedongyeojido,&quot; () a map of Korea that was published in 1861, from which a single-sheet version, the &quot;Daedongyeojijeondo&quot; (ëëì¬ì§ì ë å¤§æ±èå°å¨å), was subsequently made.

The events surrounding Kim&#x27;s death are obscure. Following the publication of a later version of the &quot;Daedongyeojido&quot; in 1866, Kim is not heard from again. The document from the Governor-General of Korea asserts that the Korean regent Daewongun, upon viewing the later version of Kim&#x27;s great map, became incensed by its inclusion of sensitive details critical to national defense. According to the document, the Daewongun had Kim arrested and jailed, and the maps destroyed.

However, the original wood printing block of &quot;Daedongyeojido&quot; can still be found in the Soongsil University and also in the Korea University, contradicting the Governor-Generalâs document. Furthermore, others who helped develop the map, such as Choe Han-gi and Shin Hun, were not convicted at all. The Korean historical community generally believe that the document was a fabrication by the General-Government, which was under the control of Japan during the Japanese colonization of Korea.

The asteroid 95016 Kimjeongho is named in his honour.

<doc id="926246" wikidata="Q957354" url="?curid=926246" title="Ugocsa County">
<text>Ugocsa was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in north-western Romania () and western Ukraine (). The capital of the county was NagyszÅllÅs (now Vynohradiv, Ukraine). It was the smallest among the counties of historical Hungary.

==Geography==

Ugocsa county shared borders with the Hungarian counties MÃ¡ramaros, SzatmÃ¡r and Bereg. It was situated on both sides of the river Tisza. Its area was 1208Â km around 1910.

==History==
In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon most of the county (including NagyszÅllÅs) became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, while a very little part remained in Hungary were joined to SzatmÃ¡r County, which was merged to SzatmÃ¡r-Ugocsa-Bereg County in 1923. The southern part â including Halmi (today Halmeu) â became part of Romania. In 1938, the western part of the former Czechoslovak part was returned to Hungary by the First Vienna Award, which became part of the newly formed Bereg-Ugocsa County â as SzatmÃ¡r County was recreated â but shortly in 1939 the rest became part of Hungary again as the remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia was annexed after Czechoslovakia ceased to exist. These part were assigned to the administrative branch offices of MÃ¡ramaros. In 1940, by the Second Vienna Award the southern part as well returned to Hungary thus the county was recreated with a modified territory, with the parts also included earlier to the administrative branch offices of MÃ¡ramaros. The capital again became NagyszÅllÅs.

After World War II, the formerly Czechoslovak part of Ugocsa county became part of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian SSR, Zakarpattia Oblast. Since 1991, when the Soviet Union split up, the Zakarpattia Oblast has been part of Ukraine. The southern part of the county became part of Romania again and is now part of the Romanian county Satu Mare.

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Ugocsa county were:

Vynohradiv is now in Ukraine; Halmeu is now in Romania.

<text>Morton H. Halperin (born June 13, 1938) is an American analyst who deals with U.S. foreign policy, arms control, civil liberties, and the workings of bureaucracies.

He served in the Johnson, Nixon, Clinton, and Obama administrations. He has taught at Harvard University and as a visitor at other universities including Columbia, George Washington University, and Yale.

He has served in a number of roles with think tanks, including the Center for American Progress, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Twentieth Century Fund. He was also a senior advisor to the Open Society Foundations.

==Early career==
Halperin was born to a Jewish family on June 13, 1938, in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn and received his BA in political science from Columbia University in 1958. Thereafter, he attended Yale University, where he received an MA in international relations in 1959 and a PhD in the discipline in 1961.

Halperin has three sons, including Mark Halperin.

In 2005, he married Diane Orentlicher, a professor of international law at the American University Washington College of Law. Orentlicher formerly served as a deputy in the Office of War Crimes in the U.S. Department of State.

Halperin began his career in academia as a research associate at the Harvard Center for International Affairs (1960â66). He was an instructor in government at Harvard (1961-1963) and an assistant professor of government (1964-1966).

== Johnson and Nixon administrations ==
From 1966 to 1967, Halperin served as a special assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.

At 29-years-old, from 1967 to 1969, he became the youngest ever Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs (Policy, Planning, and Arms Control).

He joined the National Security Council in 1969 as the director of policy planning. Halperin and Henry Kissinger, Nixon&#x27;s new National Security Advisor, had been colleagues at Harvard.

Halperin&#x27;s appointment was immediately criticized by General Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; FBI director J. Edgar Hoover; and Senator Barry Goldwater.

=== Wire tapping and Nixon&#x27;s enemies list ===

On May 9, 1969, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the United States had been bombing Cambodia. Kissinger called Hoover to find out who might have leaked this information to the press. Hoover suggested Halperin, and Kissinger agreed that was likely. That day, the FBI began tapping Halperin&#x27;s phones at Kissinger&#x27;s direction. The Nixon administration bugged Halperin&#x27;s home phone, without a warrant, for 21 months starting in 1969.

Halperin also ended up on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List of 20 people with whom the White House was unhappy because they disagreed in some way with the administration. Halperin was number 8 on the list. Nixon aide Charles Colson, who compiled the list, wrote next to Halperin&#x27;s name, &quot;a scandal would be helpful here.&quot;

Defense Secretary Robert McNamara asked Halperin to oversee the production of the Pentagon Papers. Les Gelb, a member of Halperin&#x27;s staff, oversaw the staff that actually wrote the study. Halperin was a friend of Daniel Ellsberg. When Ellsberg was investigated in connection with the Pentagon Papers, suspicion fell on Halperin, who some Nixon aides believed had kept classified documents when he left government service. The tapping of Halperin&#x27;s phone without a warrant was discovered when it came out in Ellsberg&#x27;s trial.

Despite the continued use of the wiretap well after Halperin left government, Kissinger told reporters on May 13, 1973, that, &quot;I never received any information that cast any doubt on [Halperin&#x27;s] loyalty and discretion.&quot;

Halperin sued in federal court. Halperin won a symbolic $1 judgment in 1977 for the offense, but the judgment was overturned by an appeals court. In 1991, Kissinger apologized to Halperin in a letter and the suit was dropped at Halperin&#x27;s request in 1992.

== Positions between government service ==
After leaving the Nixon administration, Halperin joined the Brookings Institution as a senior fellow from 1969 to 1973 and then became the research director for the Project on Information, National Security and Constitutional Procedures at the Twentieth Century Fund from 1974 to 1975. He was the director for the Project on National Security and Civil Liberties from 1975 to 1977.

From 1977 to 1992, he served as the director of the Center for National Security Studies (jointly sponsored by the Fund for Peace and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. And from 1992 to 1994, he was a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

== American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ==
From 1984 to 1992, Halperin served as director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) office in Washington.

While at the ACLU, Halperin, along with Jerry Berman, also at the ACLU, worked with President Reagan&#x27;s CIA Director William Casey to agree on language in the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, which has successfully protected journalists publishing the names of covert agents. He also worked on a number of civil rights bills, including an immigration reform bill in 1986, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, and the American Disabilities Act of 1990. He defended the right of &quot;The Progressive&quot; magazine to publish a description of the design principle of a thermonuclear weapon (H-Bomb).

== Clinton administration ==
At the start of the Clinton administration, Halperin was appointed as a consultant to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (1993).

In 1994 President Clinton nominated Halperin for the position of assistant secretary of defense for democracy and peacekeeping, and was opposed by the Senate Armed Services Committee which supplied a detailed list of Halperin&#x27;s activities and stated views which it regarded as incompatible with his appointment. Clinton then named him to be a Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Democracy at the National Security Council (1994â1996).

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appointed him to the position of Director of Policy Planning at the State Department (1998â2001) in Clinton&#x27;s second term. Halperin focused on several issues of interest to Secretary Albright, including democracy promotion (the Community of Democracies and inauguration of the four priority democracies); nuclear issues; a review of the way that the United States responds to humanitarian disasters overseas; and northeast Asian security. He also was integrally involved in managing the crises in Kosovo and East Timor.

== Post-Clinton administration ==
Following his service in the Clinton Administration, Halperin joined the Council on Foreign Relations (2001-2002) as senior fellow and director, Center for Democracy and Free Markets.

Halperin created the Open Society Foundations&#x27; office in Washington, D.C., and oversaw all policy advocacy on U.S. and international issues, including promotion of human rights and support for open societies abroad. He was the director of the Washington office for the Open Society Institute (now the Open Society Foundations) from 2002 to 2005 and the director of U.S. advocacy from 2005 to 2008. He was the executive director of the Open Society Policy Center from 2002 to 2008.

He also was a senior vice president at the Center for American Progress from 2003 to 2005 and a senior fellow at CAP from 2003 to 2009.

He was a senior advisor to the Open Society Foundations. He retired in 2002.

== Obama administration ==
President Obama nominated Halperin to serve on the board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2012 and again in 2015, and he was twice confirmed by the U.S. Senate. He served as director until March 9, 2018.

== Publications ==
Halperin is the author and co-author of 25 books, including &quot;Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy&quot;. The first edition of &quot;Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Strategy and Arms Control&quot; (with Thomas C. Schelling); &quot;Limited War in the Nuclear Age&quot;; and &quot;Contemporary Military Strategy&quot;.

<doc id="926251" wikidata="Q192033" url="?curid=926251" title="Zersenay Tadese">
<text>Zersenay Tadese Habtesilase (Tigrinya: áá­á¥á°áá­ á³á°á°; born 8 February 1982) is a retired Eritrean long-distance track and road running athlete. He held the men&#x27;s half marathon world record from 2010 to 2018. His bronze medal in the 10,000 metres at the 2004 Athens Olympics made him the first ever Eritrean Olympic medallist, and his 20-km title at the 2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships also made him the country&#x27;s first athlete to win at a world championship event. He does not use a sprint finish to win races; his strategy relies on a combination of efficient running and fast pace setting.

Zersenay (&quot;Tadese&quot; is his father&#x27;s name) has found most of his success in the half marathon, with four consecutive victories in the World Half Marathon Championships from 2006 to 2009 (with a 2006 20Â km edition), a silver medal in 2010 and a fifth title in 2012. His 5 titles are a record. He set a world record at the Lisbon Half Marathon in 2010.

He has also excelled in cross country running, winning a gold, a silver, and two bronze medals in the long-distance race over five IAAF World Cross Country Championships. He is a four-time Olympian (2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016).

In 2009, Zersenay became only the second man (after Paul Tergat) to win three World Championship medals over three different surfaces in the same year, winning World Cross Country bronze, 10,000 metres World Championship silver on the track, and gold in road running at the World Half Marathon Championships. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner.

In 2016, he was chosen to be part of Nike&#x27;s Breaking2 team to try to break 2 hours for the marathon and finished in 2:06:51.

==Career==

===Early life===
Zersenay Tadese 
was born in Adi Bana, and had a peaceful, rural upbringing with his six siblings, largely avoiding the troubles of the Eritrean War of Independence. He became interested in cycling in his teenage years and, after winning a number of races, he set his sights upon becoming a professional cyclist in Europe. However, the races of 30â50Â km fell short of the distances needed to compete on the European circuit and he was ill-prepared for a transition to top-level cycling.

He was a relative late-comer to competitive running: in his late teens, scouts from a local athletics club suggested that his cycling stamina might translate to running and invited him to compete. He won the race and was spurred on by the victory to start taking the sport seriously and focus on running. Zersenay was adamant that his early years in cycling had given him a firm foundation for endurance running.

His first foray into the international athletics circuit came in 2002, when he attended the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Dublin. Although he was wearing ill-fitting shoes and was somewhat puzzled at hearing a starting gun for the first time, he managed to finish in 30th place with a time of 36Â minutes and 37Â seconds. However, he remained some distance off the winner Kenenisa Bekele. He competed at his first IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in May of that year, finishing just outside the top twenty runners with a time of 1:03:05. He competed on the track at the African Athletics Championships, taking sixth place in the 10,000 metres race in RadÃ¨s, Tunisia, rounding off a modest debut year.

The 2003 season saw Zersenay establish himself as an emerging force in cross country: he broke into the top ten at the 2003 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, and finished in the top three in all of his six races in Europe that winter. A 5000 metres win at the KBC Night of Athletics brought Zersenay an Eritrean record of 13:11.07, and a place at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. At the 2003 World Championships, he improved his record further to 13:05.57 and finished in eighth place in the 5000 metres final. More improvements came at the World Half Marathon Championships in Vilamoura, Portugal, where he recorded a personal best of 1:01:26 to finish in seventh position.

===Olympic medalist===
The 2004 season represented a breakthrough for Zersenay and he established himself as a serious contender in distance running. He signed a contract with Adidas Spain and brought the team victory at the European Clubs&#x27; Cross Country Cup in February. The following month he bettered his previous showings at the World Cross Country Championships with a sixth-place finish. With the help of teammates Yonas Kifle and Tesfayohannes Mesfen, among others, he took Eritrea to third position in the team competition â the first time the country had reached the podium at a world cross country event. Two months later he finished second in the 10Â km Great Manchester Run; his time of 27:59 was five seconds behind winner Craig Mottram. He took to the track in June at a meeting in GavÃ , Spain, and recorded another national record, this time in the 10,000Â m with a time of 27:32.61.

The peak of his season came at the 2004 Athens Olympics, where he became the first person in Eritrean sporting history to win an Olympic medal. Zersenay took the bronze in the 10,000 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece behind Kenenisa Bekele, and Sileshi Sihine. His performance of 27:22.57 represented a dramatic improvement as he had beaten his previous best by ten seconds, despite unfavourably hot conditions. Zersenay refused to politicise his medal win behind his Ethiopian counterparts, stating: &quot;we have always been friends with the Ethiopians. Now we are a nation...I can say I am very happy.&quot; The Eritrean-born runner Meb Keflezighi, representing the United States, won silver in the marathon a few days later, highlighting the country&#x27;s improving standards. Zersenay finished his first Olympics by reaching another event final: he took seventh place in the men&#x27;s 5000 metres race, confirming his position as a world-class runner.

He opened 2005 with a second win in the European Clubs&#x27; Cross Country Cup. He won his first World Cross Country Championship medal soon after, finishing second to Bekele to take silver at the 2005 edition. On the track, he recorded a 5000Â m personal best of at the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha, and qualified to compete at the World Championships in both the 5000 and 10,000Â m. At the 2005 World Championships, he broke the national record in the 10,000 m final, but his time of 27:12.82 was only enough for sixth. The 5000 m final held little reprieve for the Eritrean as he finished in second last position. He ended the season on a positive note, however, improving his 10,000Â m best to 27:04.70 at the Memorial Van Damme, and winning the Great North Run with a world best time of 59:05 â which was only his second outing over the half marathon distance.

===Road and cross country world champion===
Zersenay failed to make the podium for a second time at the 2006 World Cross Country Championships, but his fourth-place finish headed the Eritrean team towards silver medal in the team competition. The following month, Zersenay overcame both Fabiano Joseph and Boniface Kiprop to win the Great Manchester Run. He sprinted to the line with a finishing time of 27:36; an Eritrean record and the second fastest that year. In August that year, he significantly improved his 10,000Â m best at Memorial Van Damme; his time of 26:37.25 knocked almost thirty seconds off his previous mark to make him the 8th fastest person ever, but he still finished behind the emerging Micah Kogo who ran the tenth fastest ever time. A new best of 59:16 by Zersenay at the Rotterdam Half Marathon equalled Samuel Wanjiru&#x27;s course record and boded well for the upcoming championship race.

He scored a striking victory at the 2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, finishing the 20Â km race in 56:01 â a time which was second only to Haile Gebrselassie&#x27;s world record and was forty seconds faster than the silver medallist Robert Kipchumba. It was first time that an Eritrean had won a major world title in sport. As Zersenay did not possess a strong sprint finish (crucial for success on the track) commentators suggested that a move to the marathon distance seemed an obvious career progression, but he downplayed the idea, stating that he would not change distances in the near future. He closed the season with a run at the New Year&#x27;s Eve 10Â km road race: the San Silvestre Vallecana in Madrid. Zersenay and Eliud Kipchoge were awarded the same time of 26:54, but Kipchoge was announced as the race winner. Although this was faster than Haile Gebrselassie&#x27;s world record of 27:02 at the time, it was not ratifiable as the runners benefited from the race&#x27;s downhill circuit.

The 2007 season brought Zersenay his greatest medal haul, as he succeeded on grass, track and road. For the first time in his career he overcame all opposition, including five-time champion Kenenisa Bekele, to become the 2007 World Cross Country Champion. The hot conditions in Mombasa forced a number of runners out of the race, but Zersenay maintained his pace to finish over twenty seconds ahead of the next runner. At the CÃ¡ceres Half Marathon, he stated his intention to try for the world record and, although he won the race, poor pacing left him some distance from a record time. He returned to the Great Manchester Run and again improved his best, recording 27:24, but this was not enough to beat Micah Kogo who won in a UK all-comers record time. He competed at the Prefontaine Classic for the first time, and set a two miles best of 8:19.34, although he was some distance behind winner Craig Mottram.

The 2007 All-Africa Games represented a double landmark victory for Zersenay: he became the first Eritrean medallist in the competition&#x27;s history, and won his first ever gold medal on the track, sealing victory in the 10,000 m final with a Games record time of 27:00.30. The following month he competed at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, and he edged closer to a podium finish â he led the 10,000 m race up to the 8Â km mark, setting a fast pace, but ultimately ended up in fourth position. Preparing for the road championships that year, he ran the 10-mile Dam tot Damloop race in September and won in 45:51 (the world&#x27;s fastest that season), finishing some distance ahead of runners up Bernard Kipyego and James Rotich. Zersenay emphasised his position as one of the world&#x27;s most dominant half marathon runners with a second victory at the 2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Udine, Italy. Although he was close to world record pace at the 15Â km point, he slowed behind the leading pack of Makau Musyoki, Evans Kiprop Cheruiyot and Deriba Merga. In the final kilometre, he burst away to take the lead and the gold medal, setting a national and championship record time of 58:59 in the process. Following these achievements, a medical team did a study of his running economy and found him to be one of the most efficient runners ever to be tested.

===World Half Marathon champion===

Bekele was keen to regain his cross country title from Zersenay and the 2008 cross country season was a competitive one. At the Great Edinburgh International Cross Country race, Zersenay was pipped by the Ethiopian at the line, finishing just one second behind. The following month, Zersenay beat Eliud Kipchoge to win the Cinque Mulini race in the buildup to the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. On the day of the Championship race in Edinburgh, Scotland, Zersenay took the lead early on and set a strong pace at the mid-race point. However, near the finish Bekele and Kenyan Leonard Komon surged ahead to leave Zersenay as the bronze medallist.

A win at the World 10K Bangalore, where he beat Moses Kipsiro in 27:51, was the highlight of a low-key build up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In August, Zersenay was among some forty runners competing for the medals in the 10,000 metres Olympic final. Zersenay&#x27;s brother, Kidane, was also competing and he led for most of first half of what was a quick race. Zersenay Tadese had the lead at the 7â8000Â m mark but Bekele and Sihine sprinted into first and second. Although Zersenay&#x27;s time almost equalled the previous Olympic record for the event, he ended up one second behind Kenyans Moses Masai and Micah Kogo, taking fifth place overall.

After the Olympics, Zersenay returned to Eritrea and trained for one month to prepare for the 2008 World Half Marathon Championships in Rio de Janeiro. He won his third consecutive title over the half marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home country, so much so that the President of Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.

Zersenay took third place at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in a closely contested race, finishing just behind a resurgent Gebregziabher Gebremariam and Ugandan runner Moses Kipsiro. He competed in his first ever full-length marathon in April, signing up for the London Marathon. His first appearance over the distance was much anticipated following his cross country and track success, but he could not finish the race, pulling out around the 35Â km mark.

He rebounded, however, taking silver in the 10,000 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, finishing behind Kenenisa Bekele. Zersenay had led for a large part of the race, setting a fast pace, but he was beaten to the gold by Bekele&#x27;s sprint finish. Following this, he won his third World Half Marathon title, setting a Championship record of 59:35 and also winning a silver medal with Eritrea in the team competition. The gold medal over the half marathon distance made him the second runner ever to win a World Championship medal in cross country, track and road racing all in the same year, a feat achieved previously by only Paul Tergat.

===Half marathon world record===
Zersenay&#x27;s first road race of 2010 was the Lisbon Half Marathon. The organisers had modified the course and assembled a field of fast runners in order to facilitate a quick race. Despite the top five athletes all running personal best times, Zersenay was alone at the very front from 10Â km onwards. He fell four seconds short of the 15Â km world record, but significantly revised Haile Gebrselassie&#x27;s four-year-old 20Â km world mark to 55:21, beating it by almost half a minute. Samuel Wanjiru&#x27;s half marathon world record was next to fall as Zersenay crossed the line at 58:23 minutes, a clear ten seconds ahead of the previous mark.

He managed to finish his first full-marathon at the 2010 London Marathon, although his time of 2:12:03 for seventh place was not as strong a transition as expected. He made his first appearance at the Giro di Castelbuono in Sicily in July and, although he described the course as &quot;very hard&quot;, he won the race ahead of Samuel Wanjiru. He attempted for yet another title at the 2010 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, but Wilson Kiprop brought an end to his four-year reign â the Eritrean took the silver medal, labouring towards the end and pulling up in injured at the line. He was still suffering from the injury at the San Silvestre Vallecana some two months later, although he managed to beat Ayad Lamdassem to win the race.

He was at full strength at the 2011 Lisbon Half Marathon: he missed his world record mark but ran the second fastest of all-time (58:30 minutes). In the outdoor track season he ran 26:51.09 minutes for the 10,000Â m at the Prefontaine Classic and came close to a personal best with a win at the Barcelona Meeting with a time of 12:59.32 minutes. Making his fourth consecutive appearance in the event, he took fourth place in the men&#x27;s 10,000Â m at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. He ended the year with road wins at the Porto Half Marathon and the SÃ£o Silvestre de Luanda, setting course records of 59:30 minutes and 27:44 minutes, respectively.

At the 2012 World&#x27;s Best 10K he came third, beaten by Sammy Kitwara and Vincent Chepkok. He won the Lisbon Half Marathon for the third straight year, but was slower than previous times (59:34) due to warm conditions and having the flu. A run at the 2012 London Marathon saw him perform better than he did in 2010, but he lost touch with the leading pack after the halfway point and came fourteenth with a time of 2:10:41 hours. He was chosen as Eritrea&#x27;s flag bearer at the 2012 London Olympics and ran in the 10,000 metres final. He set the pace early on in the race but was defeated in the sprint finish, finishing in sixth place some three seconds behind the winner Mo Farah. After the Olympics he ran at the 2012 World Half Marathon Championships. He dominated the race from just beyond the 5Â km point, and won it convincingly in a time of 1:00:19 hours, 32 seconds ahead of the runner-up, Deressa Chimsa. Only two weeks later he entered the Great Birmingham Run, but he appeared tired and finished third in a race where the top three all dipped under Haile Gebrselassie&#x27;s course record.

===2013â19 seasons===
Zersenay managed only seventh at the World&#x27;s Best 10K in February but returned to the top of the podium in his speciality at the Prague Half Marathon, edging out his training partner Amanuel Mesel with a time of 60:10. He clocked another win over the distance at the Gifu Seiryu Half Marathon, beating the defending champion Martin Mathathi and setting a course record of 60:31 minutes. In October, he attempted to run the Chicago Marathon, but dropped out shortly after the halfway point. He did not compete again until February 2014, when he won at the small CÃ¡ceres cross country in Spain.

At the 2016 Olympics in Rio he competed in the final of the 10,000Â m finishing 8th in a time of 27.23.

He won 18 out of 29 half Marathons he raced.

In 2019, he competed in the men&#x27;s marathon at the 2019 World Athletics Championships held in Doha, Qatar. He finished in 6th place.

==Personal life==
A quietly spoken athlete, he frequently states that his victories are a tribute to his country. Eritrea is one of Africa&#x27;s newest and least populous countries, and Zersenay&#x27;s achievements on the world athletics stage have made him one of the country&#x27;s most identifiable sportsmen. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner who has competed at the World Cross Country Championships and the 2008 Summer Olympics.

==Notes==
*Early in his career, his name was often reported as Zersenay &quot;Tadesse&quot;, with the letter &quot;s&quot; appearing twice in the last name. The athlete has since clarified that this is incorrect and it is correctly spelt with a single &quot;s&quot; in the surname. Tadese is his father&#x27;s first name â see Habesha naming system.

<text>The sixth HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot;, of the British Royal Navy was a 78-gun (or 80-gun) second-rate ship of the line, launched on 25 August 1835 at Pembroke Yard. She was the first of a new type of sailing battleship: a Symondite.

==Construction==
The &quot;Vanguard&quot; was designed by John Edye, Chief Clerk in the Surveyor&#x27;s Office, to the directions of the Surveyor, Captain Sir William Symonds. The &quot;Vanguard&quot; was the first of a class of eleven. She was ordered from Pembroke Yard in June 1832; HMS &quot;Collingwood&quot; was ordered &#x27;as a duplicate frame using the moulds of &quot;Vanguard&quot;, to test the efficacy of an American scheme whereby duplicate frames were stored for many years.&#x27; &quot;Vanguard&quot; was laid down in May 1833; she required 60 skilled men for 16 weeks to set up the frame. She was launched on schedule in August 1835. At the time she was the broadest ship ever built in England.&quot; &#x27;Vanguard&quot; cost Â£56,983 to build, and a further Â£20,756 to fit for sea.&#x27; Her construction used 3,560 loads of timber and required 186 man-years.

==Characteristics of Symondite warships==

Warships designed to the ideas of Captain Sir William Symonds (1782â1856) are known as &quot;Symondite&quot; warships, although the adjective has no official use as terminology. His intention was to give the Royal Navy an advantage in speed (under certain weather conditions), allowing it to force action.

Symondite warships were very broad, and had a sharp V-shaped hull-form. (Preceding designs had a U-shaped hull form.)
* Their wide beam gave them very high stability, which allowed them to carry nearly twice the power of sail as vessels of the old type. Unfortunately the Surveyor&#x27;s department was understaffed, with the result that their stability was over-done. Symondite warships rolled quickly, heavily and sometimes unevenly. This made them poor gun platforms. The rapid rolling also caused the rigging to wear out more quickly than on previous designs.
* Because Symondite warships got their stability from their great beam, they did not need to carry so much iron ballast as previous designs.
* Their V-shaped hull with its steeply rising floors was inconvenient for carrying stores.
* They had higher and wider gun decks than preceding designs. This gave the gun crews more space to work in, improving efficiency. It also helped their sailing performance, because they were carrying fewer guns for their size.
* They had an excessively raked stern. In some ships, modifications to their sterns to remedy defects in the original design left &quot;the stern timbers badly arranged, weakly supported and held together with iron straps.&quot; The Symondite stern &quot;lacked the defensive strength of the true round stern. There was simply too much glass to offer any protection to the crews of the stern battery in action.&quot;

Symondite warships were very sensitive to how they were stowed. If trimmed carefully, they were fast in moderate winds, thought they did not do as well as preceding designs in head seas, or rough seas.

Compared with previous designs, Symondite warships required 19% more loads of wood and 30% more man-hours to build.

Some of the Symondite warships were converted to steam in the 1850s (though not &quot;Vanguard&quot;). Their V-shaped hull made it difficult to add a steam engine and boilers and to store coal. The extra weight was low in the ship, exacerbating their excess stability, which made their rolling even worse than before. (In fairness, at the time they were designed, it was never anticipated that they would be converted to steam.)

==Service life==

&quot;Vanguard&quot; was commissioned in 1837 by Captain Sir Thomas Fellowes, with the normal picked complement of officers, including Baldwin Walker as First Lieutenant and Mr Miller, one of Symonds&#x27;s favourite sailing masters. The object was clear. Symonds wanted his ships to be tried by men capable of making the best of their qualities... Out in the Mediterranean &quot;Vanguard&quot; soon made a name for herself as the fastest ship in the fleet, with the handiness of a frigate when beat out of Grand Harbour [Malta].&#x27; At the end of her first three-year commission Captain Fellowes wrote that Vanguard had &#x27;great stability&#x27; was &#x27;very easy at sea and works less than ships of her class&#x27; and had &#x27;great advantage in all points of sailing.&#x27;

On the night of 30 January 1838, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was at Malta under the command of Captain Sir Thomas Fellowes. The ship&#x27;s First Lieutenant, C.M.M. Wright, ordered the Assistant Surgeon, Robert Thomas Charles Scott, to stomach-pump a drunken seaman. Scott expressed the medical opinion that a stomach-pump should not be administered. Wright ordered him to give it anyway as a punishment and reminded Scott that it was an order he had received. A short while later Wright ordered Scott to do the same to another seaman. The next morning Scott reported the matter to Commander Baldwin Walker who reported Scott to the Captain for disrespect and disobedience of a lawful order. Captain Fellowes threatened Scott with a court martial and reported him to Sir William Burnett, the Physician-General of the Navy. When this affair became public knowledge, an Admiralty Order was issued banning the use of a stomach-pump as a punishment.

Captain David Dunn commanded &quot;Vanguard&quot; from 2 April 1843 to August 1843. &quot;Vanguard&quot; again served in the Mediterranean (including operations on the coast of Syria in 1840), and off Lisbon. In October 1843 &quot;Vanguard&quot; was out of commission at Devonport.

On 4 February 1845, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was commissioned by Captain George Wickens Willes, and served in the Channel Squadron, the 1845 and 1846 Evolutionary Squadrons, and in Mediterranean.

In the first trial of the Evolutionary Squadron of 1845, &quot;Vanguard&quot; (Captain George Willes) and her sister &quot;Superb&quot; (Captain Anwar Lowry Corry) were the slowest battleships in the squadron. The Surveyor (Symonds) thought that they had been badly stowed and needed recoppering. Once this was done they performed well. &quot;Vanguard&#x27;s&quot; captain wrote: &#x27;such an entire change has taken place in her motion at sea, steering and working generally (although she is still deficient in her weights low down) that I can scarcely bring myself to believe she is the same ship.&#x27; &quot;Vanguard&quot; was refitted after the 1845 trials (as were &quot;Superb&quot; and &quot;Canopus&quot;). In the August 1846 trials, &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Canopus&quot; were &#x27;nearly alike in performance, with the former superior in smooth water, and the latter in rough.&#x27; (The significance of &quot;Canopus&quot; is that she was regarded as one of the best of the previous type of 84-gun two-deckers.)

In May 1846 Evolutionary Squadron exercised firing the stern batteries. This was a rare occurrence and reflects no credit on any of the two-deckers:
*&quot;Vanguard&quot; took ten minutes to clear for action and then fired two rounds from each stern gun. However the extreme overhang of the stern prevented the muzzles running clear, with the result that there was a minor fire.
*&quot;Superb&quot; took 15Â minutes to clear for action plus an hour to remove her sashes, and then was able to fire without incident.
*&quot;Canopus&quot; was excused firing altogether.

Captain Willes died on 26 October 1847. Captain George Frederick Rich commanded &quot;Vanguard&quot; in the Mediterranean from 6 November 1847 until &quot;Vanguard&quot; paid off in March 1849.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; did not see service during the Crimean War.

Unlike most members of the &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was not converted to steam.

Vanguard&#x27;s last commission was as Coast Guard at Kingston from 18 February 1861 to March 1862, commanded by Commanded by Captain Edmund Heathcote.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; was renamed &quot;Ajax&quot; in 1867, to allow her former name to be given to an ironclad battleship then being laid down in the ways. &quot;Ajax&quot; (ex-&quot;Vanguard&quot;) was broken up in 1875.
