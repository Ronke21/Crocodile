<text>The English language terminology used in the classification of [[sword]]s is imprecise and has varied widely over time. There is no historical dictionary for the universal names, classification, or terminology of swords; a sword was simply a single-edged or double-edged knife that grew incrementally longer and more complex with technological advances.

Historical terms without a universal consensus of definition (e.g. &quot;arming sword&quot;, &quot;broadsword&quot;, &quot;long sword&quot;, etc.) were used to label weapons of similar appearance but of different historical periods, regional cultures, and fabrication technology. These terms were often described in relation to other unrelated weapons, without regard to their intended use and fighting style. In modern history, many of these terms have been given specific, often arbitrary meanings that are unrelated to any of their historical meanings.

==Terminology==
Some of these terms originate contemporaneously with the weapons which they describe. Others are modern or early modern terms used by antiquarians, curators, and modern-day sword enthusiasts for historical swords.

Terminology was further complicated by terms introduced or misinterpreted in the 19th century by antiquarians and in 20th century pop culture, and by the addition of new terms such as &quot;great sword&quot;, &quot;Zweihänder&quot; (instead of &quot;Beidhänder&quot;), and &quot;cut-and-thrust sword&quot;. Historical European Martial Arts associations have turned the term &quot;spada da lato&quot; into &quot;side-sword&quot;. Furthermore, there is a deprecation of the term &quot;broadsword&quot; by these associations. All these newly introduced or redefined terms add to the confusion of the matter.

The most well-known systematic typology of blade types of the European medieval sword is the Oakeshott typology, although this is also a modern classification and not a medieval one. Elizabethans used descriptive terms such as &quot;short&quot;, &quot;bastard&quot;, and &quot;long&quot; which emphasized the length of the blade, and &quot;two-handed&quot; for any sword that could be wielded by two hands.

==Classification by hilt type==
===Handedness===
The term two-handed sword may refer to any large sword designed to be used primarily with two hands:
* the European longsword, popular in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance.
** the Scottish late medieval claymore (not to be confused with the basket-hilted claymore of the 18th century)
* the &quot;Bidenhänder&quot; sword favored by the &quot;Landsknechte&quot; of 16th-century Germany

The term &quot;hand-and-a-half sword&quot; is modern (late 19th century).
During the first half of the 20th century, the term &quot;bastard sword&quot; was used regularly to refer to this type of sword, while &quot;long sword&quot; or &quot;long-sword&quot; referred to the rapier (in the context of Renaissance or Early Modern fencing).

The term &quot;single-handed sword&quot; or &quot;one-handed sword&quot; was coined to distinguish from &quot;two-handed&quot; or &quot;hand-and-a-half&quot; swords.
&quot;Single-handed sword&quot; is used by Sir Walter Scott. It is also used as a possible gloss of the obscure term &quot;tonsword&quot; by Nares (1822); &quot;one-handed sword&quot; is somewhat later, recorded from .

Some swords were designed for left-hand use, although left-handed swords have been described as &quot;a rarity&quot;.

====Great sword====
Great swords or greatswords are related to the long swords of the Middle Ages. The great sword was developed during the Renaissance, but its earlier cousin the Scottish Claymore was very similar in size and use, like the &quot;outsized specimens&quot; between (approx. the same height as the user) such as the Oakeshott type XIIa or Oakeshott type XIIIa. These swords were too heavy to be wielded one-handed and possessed a large grip for leverage.

====Claymore====
The Scottish name &quot;claymore&quot; (, lit. &quot;large/great sword&quot;) can refer to either the longsword with a distinctive two-handed grip, or the basket-hilted sword. The two-handed claymore is an early Scottish version of a greatsword.

==== &quot;Zweihänder&quot; ====
The &quot;Zweihänder&quot; (&quot;two-hander&quot;) or &quot;Beidhänder&quot; (&quot;both-hander&quot;) is a true two-handed sword, in the sense that it cannot be wielded in only one hand. It was a specialist weapon wielded by certain &quot;Landsknechte&quot; (mercenary soldiers), so-called &quot;Doppelsöldners&quot;.

==Classification by blade type==
===Double-edge and straight swords===
These are double-edged, usually straight-bladed swords, designed for optimized balance, reach and versatility.
 (; Cantonese: ) is a double-edged straight sword used during the last 2,500 years in China. The first Chinese sources that mention the date to the 7th century BC during the Spring and Autumn period; one of the earliest specimens being the Sword of Goujian. Historical one-handed versions have blades varying from in length. The weight of an average sword of blade-length would weigh about . There are also larger two-handed versions used by ancient and medieval armies and for training by many styles of Chinese martial arts. Two handed jians from the time of the Chu and Han dynasty were up to long.

====Longsword====
In modern times, the term longsword most frequently refers to a late Medieval and Renaissance weapon designed for use with two hands. The German (&quot;long sword&quot;) in 15th-century manuals did not necessarily denote a type of weapon, but the technique of fencing with both hands at the hilt.

The French and the English &quot;bastard sword&quot; originate in the 15th or 16th century, originally having the general sense of &quot;irregular sword or sword of uncertain origin&quot;. It was &quot;[a sword] which was neither French, nor Spanish, nor properly [German], but longer than any of these sturdy swords.&quot; could also historically refer to a single-handed sword with a fairly long blade compared to other short swords.

Joseph Swetnam states that the bastard sword is midway in length between an arming sword and a long sword, and Randall Cotgrave&#x27;s definition seems to imply this, as well. The French was also known as (i.e., bastard sword) and also (literally a cross-hilted blade). The term referred to a medieval single-handed sword optimized for thrusting. The was the sidearm of the (French or Breton bowmen of the 15th and 16th centuries). The term comes from the fact that these swords passed () the length of a &quot;normal&quot; short sword.

The &quot;Masters of Defence&quot; competition organised by Henry VIII in July 1540 listed &quot;two hande sworde&quot;, &quot;bastard sworde&quot;, and &quot;longe sworde&quot; as separate items (as it should in Joseph Swetnam&#x27;s context).

Antiquarian usage in the 19th century established the use of &quot;bastard sword&quot; as referring unambiguously to these large swords. However, George Silver and Joseph Swetnam refer to them merely as &quot;two hande sworde&quot;. The term &quot;hand-and-a-half sword&quot; is modern (late 19th century). During the first half of the 20th century, the term &quot;bastard sword&quot; was used regularly to refer to this type of sword.

The Elizabethan long sword (cf. George Silver and Joseph Swetnam) is a single-handed &quot;cut-and-thrust&quot; sword with a blade similar to the long rapier. &quot;Let thy (long) Rapier or (long) Sword be foure foote at the least, and thy dagger two foote.&quot; Historical terms (15th to 16th century) for this type of sword included the Italian and French .

The term longsword has been used to refer to different kinds of sword depending on historical context:
* or two-hander, a late Renaissance sword of the 16th century , the longest sword of all;
* the long &quot;side sword&quot; or &quot;rapier&quot; with a cutting edge (the Elizabethan long sword).

The was a double-edged longsword used by the Romans. The idea for the came from the swords of ancient Celts in Germany and Britain. It was longer than the , and had more reach, so the was most popular with soldiers in the cavalry. The blade could range between long while the handle was usually between .
====Broadsword====
* Claymore
* Basket-hilted sword
* Sabre

The term &quot;broadsword&quot; was never used historically to describe the one-handed arming sword. The arming sword was wrongly labelled a broadsword by antiquarians as the medieval swords were similar in blade width to the military swords of the day (that were also sometimes labeled as broadswords) and broader than the dueling swords and ceremonial dress swords.

====Shortswords and daggers====
Knives such as the seax and other blades of similar length between , they are sometimes construed as &quot;swords&quot; because of their longer blades. This is especially the case for weapons from antiquity, made before the development of high quality steel that is necessary for longer swords, in particular:

*Iron Age swords:
**Seax, a tool and weapon, common in Northern Europe.
**, an early ancient Roman thrusting shortsword for legionaries
**, a double-edged, single-hand blade used by the ancient Greeks;
*Certain Renaissance-era sidearms:
**Baselard, a late medieval heavy dagger;
**, a civilian long dagger;
**Dirk, the Scottish long dagger ();
**Hanger or wood-knife, a type of hunting sword or infantry sabre;
*Certain fascine knives:
**Model 1832 Foot Artillery Sword, is a short sword designed after the Roman with a blade length around in length. It was also known as a (literally &quot;cabbage cutter&quot;) in France.

Oversized two-handers used as parade swords or ceremonial weapons often exceeded the length and weight of practical weapons of war.

===Edgeless and thrusting swords===
The edgeless swords category comprises weapons which are related to or labelled as &quot;swords&quot; but do not emphasise hacking or slashing techniques or have any cutting edges whatsoever. The majority of these elongated weapons were designed for agility, precision and rapid thrusting blows to exploit gaps in the enemy&#x27;s defences; the major joints of the arms, the opening in a visor. However they mainly saw prominence outside the battlefield as a duelling weapon.

====Basket-hilted sword====
The &quot;basket-hilted sword&quot; is a sword type of the early modern era characterised by a basket-shaped guard that protects the hand. The basket hilt is a development of the quillons added to swords&#x27; crossguards since the Late Middle Ages.
In modern times, this variety of sword is also sometimes referred to as the broadsword.

The were always armed with a as a secondary weapon. Among most Greek warriors, this weapon had an iron blade of about . The Spartan version of the sword typically had a blade about in length. The Spartan&#x27;s shorter weapon proved deadly in the crush caused by colliding phalanx formations, as it was far more capable of being thrust through gaps in the enemy&#x27;s shield wall and armour, where there was little to no room for longer edged weapons. The groin and throat were among the favourite targets.

====Rapier====

The term &quot;rapier&quot; appeared in the English lexicon via the French which either compared the weapon to a rasp or file; it may be a corruption of &quot;rasping sword&quot; which referred to the sound the blade makes when it comes into contact with another blade. There is no historical Italian equivalent to the English word &quot;rapier&quot;.

Some swords categorised as rapiers are completely edgeless or have only a partially sharpened blade, however the majority have effective cutting blades. 

====Panzerstecher and koncerz====
The (&quot;armour stabber&quot;) is a German and East European weapon with a long, edgeless blade of square or triangular cross-section for penetrating armour. Early models were either two-handers or &quot;hand-and-a-half&quot; hilted, while later 16th and 17th century models (also known as &quot;koncerz&quot;) were one-handed and used by cavalry.

====Tuck and verdun====
The &quot;tuck&quot; (French , Italian ) is an edgeless blade of square or triangular cross-section used for thrusting. In French, also means thrust or point; and means cut and thrust.

The tuck may also get its name from the verb &quot;to tuck&quot; which means &quot;to shorten&quot;.

====Small-sword====

The small sword or smallsword (also court sword or dress sword, ) is a light one-handed sword designed for thrusting which evolved out of the longer and heavier rapier of the late Renaissance. The height of the small sword&#x27;s popularity was between the mid-17th and late 18th century. It is thought to have appeared in France and spread quickly across the rest of Europe. The small sword was the immediate predecessor of the Épée de Combat from which the Épée developed and its method of use—as typified in the works of such authors as Sieur de Liancour, Domenico Angelo, Monsieur J. Olivier, and Monsieur L&#x27;Abbat—developed into the techniques of the French classical school of fencing. Small swords were also used as status symbols and fashion accessories; for most of the 18th century anyone, civilian or military, with pretensions to gentlemanly status would have worn a small sword on a daily basis.

===Single-edge and curved swords===
These are single-cutting edged, usually thick or curved construction bladed swords, typically designed for stonger slashing, chopping, severing limbs, tripping or broad sweeping techniques; but were often very poorly designed for stabbing. Swordsmen were trained to use the bladed side in circumventing an opponent&#x27;s protected flank (known as &quot;curve into the guard&quot;), and the dulled side for defensive and blocking techniques. The curve automatically makes a swing draw an arc making it much easier to slash.

====Backsword====

The backsword was a single-edged, straight-bladed sword, typically for military use. This type of sword had a thickened back to the blade (opposite the cutting edge), which gave the blade strength. The backsword blade was cheaper to manufacture than a two-edged blade. This type of sword was first developed in Europe in the 15th century and reflected the emergence of asymmetric guards, which made a two-edged blade somewhat redundant. The backsword reached its greatest use in the 17th and 18th century when many cavalry swords, such as the British 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword, were of this form.

 are single-edged Chinese swords, primarily used for slashing and chopping. The most common form is also known as the , although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as . In China, the dao is considered one of the four traditional weapons, along with the (stick or staff), (spear), and the (sword). It is considered &quot;The General of All Weapons&quot;.

====Hook sword====

The hook sword, twin hooks, or (), also known as (tiger head hook), is a Chinese weapon traditionally associated with northern styles of Chinese martial arts and Wushu weapons routines, but now often practiced by southern styles as well.


Unlike the , which is a thrusting weapon, the was a hacking weapon in the form of a thick, curved single edged iron sword. In Athenian art, Spartan hoplites were often depicted using a instead of the , as the was seen as a quintessential &quot;villain&quot; weapon in Greek eyes.

====Khopesh====

The khopesh is an ancient Egyptian curved short sword with a overall length of approx. and was typically made of bronze or iron.

====Katana====

Historically, were one of the traditionally made that were used by the samurai of feudal Japan. Modern versions of the katana are sometimes made using non-traditional materials and methods. The katana is characterized by its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single-edged blade usually with a round guard and long grip to accommodate two hands.

====Hanger====
The hanger (obs. &quot;whinyard, whinger, cuttoe&quot;), wood-knife, or hunting sword is a long knife or short sword that hangs from the belt and was popular as both a hunting tool and weapon of war.

====Falchion and cutlass====
The falchion (French , Spanish ) proper is a wide straight-bladed but curved edged hanger or long knife. The term &#x27;falchion&#x27; may also refer to the early cutlass.

The cutlass or curtal-axe also known as a falchion (French ; Italian ; German ) is a broad-bladed curved hanger or long knife. In later usage, &#x27;cutlass&#x27; referred to the short naval boarding sabre.

====Sabre====

The British &quot;sabre&quot;, American &quot;saber&quot;, French , Spanish , Italian , German , Russian , Hungarian , Polish , and Ukrainian is a single-edged curved bladed cavalry sword.

====Scimitar====
The scimitar (French , Italian ) is a type of saber that came to refer in general to any sabre used by the Turks or Ottomans (), Persians () and more specifically the (Albanian and Greek mercenaries who fought in the French-Italian Wars and were employed throughout Western Europe). The scimitar proper was the saber, and the term was introduced into France by Philippe de Commines (1447 – 18 October 1511) as , Italy (especially the Venetian Republic who hired the as mercenaries) as , and England as &quot;cimeter&quot; or scimitar via the French and Italian terms.

<text>The saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), also called spindlehorn, Asian unicorn, or infrequently, Vu Quang bovid, is one of the world&#x27;s rarest large mammals, a forest-dwelling bovine native to the Annamite Range in Vietnam and Laos. It was described in 1993 following a discovery of remains in Vũ Quang National Park by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods as they died within a matter of weeks to months. The species was first reported in 1992 by Do Tuoc, a forest ecologist, and his associates. The first photograph of a living saola was taken in captivity in 1993. The most recent one was taken in 2013 by a movement-triggered camera in the forest of central Vietnam. It is the only species in the genus Pseudoryx.

==Taxonomy==
In May 1992, the Ministry of Forestry, Vietnam sent a survey team to examine the biodiversity of the newly established Vu Quang National Park. On this team were Do Tuoc, Le Van Cham and Vu Van Dung (of the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute); Nguyen Van Sang (of the Institute of Ecological and Biological Resources); Nguyen Thai Tu (of Vinh University); and John MacKinnon (of the World Wildlife Fund). On 21 May, the team procured a skull featuring a pair of strange, long and pointed horns from a local hunter. They came across a similar pair in the Annamite Range in the northeastern region of the reserve the following day. The team ascribed these features to a new bovid species, calling it the &quot;saola&quot; or the &quot;Vu Quang ox&quot; to avoid confusion with the sympatric serow. The WWF officially announced the discovery of the new species on 17 July 1992.

According to biodiversity specialist Tony Whitten, though Vietnam boasts a variety of flora and fauna, many of which have been recently described, the discovery of as large an animal as the saola was quite unexpected. The saola was the first large mammal to be discovered in the area for 50 years. Observations of live saola have been few and far between, restricted to the Annamite Range.

The scientific name of the saola is &quot;Pseudoryx nghetinhensis&quot;. It is the sole member of the genus &quot;Pseudoryx&quot; and is classified under the family Bovidae. The species was first described in 1993 by Vu Van Dung, Do Tuoc, biologists Pham Mong Giao and Nguyen Ngoc Chinh, Peter Arctander of the University of Copenhagen and John MacKinnon. The discovery of saola remains in 1992 generated huge scientific interest due to the animal&#x27;s special physical traits. The saola differs significantly from all other bovid genera in appearance and morphology, enough to place it in its own genus (&quot;Pseudoryx&quot;).

A recent sequencing study of ribosomal mitochondrial DNA of a large taxon sample divides the bovid family into two major subfamilial clades. The first clade is the subfamily Bovinae consisting of three tribes: Bovini (cattle and buffaloes, including the saola), Tragelaphini (Strepsicerotini) (African spiral-horned bovids) and Boselaphini (the nilgai and four-horned antelope). The second clade is the subfamily Antelopinae, which includes all other bovids. Antelopinae is composed of the three tribes: Caprini (goats, sheep, and muskox), Hippotragini (horse-like antelopes), and Antilopini (gazelles).

Since its physical traits are so complex to classify, &quot;Pseudoryx&quot; had been classified variously as member of the subfamily Caprinae and as belonging to any of the three tribes of the subfamily Bovinae: Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. DNA analysis has led scientists to place the saola as a member of the tribe Bovini. The morphology of its horns, teeth and some other features indicate it should be grouped with less-derived or more ancestral bovids. Scientific consensus may lead to classifying the saola as the sole member of a proposed new tribe, Pseudorygini.

===Etymology===
The name &#x27;saola&#x27; has been translated as &quot;spindle[-horned]&quot;, although the precise meaning is actually &quot;spinning-wheel post horn&quot;. The name comes from a Tai language of Vietnam. The meaning is the same in Lao language (, also spelled /sǎo-lǎː/ in Lao). The specific name &quot;nghetinhensis&quot; refers to the two Vietnamese provinces of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh, while &quot;Pseudoryx&quot; acknowledges the animal&#x27;s similarities with the Arabian or African oryx. The Hmong people in Laos refer to the animal as &quot;saht-supahp&quot;, a term derived from Lao ( /sàt supʰáːp/) meaning &quot;the polite animal&quot;, because it moves quietly through the forest. Other names used by minority groups in the saola&#x27;s range are &quot;lagiang&quot; (Van Kieu), &quot;a ngao&quot; (Ta Oi) and &quot;xoong xor&quot; (Katu) In the press, saolas have been referred to as &quot;Asian unicorns&quot;, an appellation apparently due to its rarity and reported gentle nature, and perhaps because both the saola and the oryx have been linked with the unicorn. No known link exists with the Western unicorn myth or the &quot;Chinese unicorn&quot;, the qilin.

==Description==
In a 1998 publication, William G. Robichaud, the coordinator of the Saola Working Group, recorded physical measurements for a captive female saola he dubbed &#x27;Martha&#x27;, in a Laotian menagerie. She was observed for around 15 days until she died from unknown causes. Robichaud noted the height of the female as at the shoulder; the back was slightly elevated, nearly taller than the shoulder height. The head-and-body length was recorded as . The general characteristics of the saola, as shown by studies during 1993–5 as well as the 1998 study, include a chocolate brown coat with patches of white on the face, throat and the sides of the neck, a paler shade of brown on the neck and the belly, a black dorsal stripe, and a pair of nearly parallel horns, present on both sexes.

Robichaud noted that the hair, straight and long, was soft and thin–a feature unusual for an animal that is associated with montane habitats in at least a few parts of its range. While the hair was found to be short on the head and the neck, it thickened to woolly hair on the insides of the forelegs and the belly. Studies before 1998 reported a hint of red in the inspected skins. The neck and the belly are a paler shade of brown compared to the rest of the body. A common observation in all the three aforementioned studies is a thick stripe extending from the shoulders to the tail along the middle of the back. The tail, which measured in Robichaud&#x27;s specimen, is divided into three horizontal bands, brown at the base, black at the tip and white in the middle. Saola skin is thick over most of the body, but thickens to near the nape of the neck and at the upper shoulders. This adaptation is thought to protect against both predators and rivals&#x27; horns during fights. Saolas weigh between approximately 80–100 kg (176–220 lbs).

The saola has round pupils with dark-brown irises that appear orange when light is shone into them; a cluster of white whiskers about long with a presumably tactile function protrude from the end of the chin. The specimen Robichaud observed could extend its tongue up to and reach its eyes and upper parts of the face; the upper surface of the tongue is covered with fine, backward-pointing barbs. Robichaud observed that either of the two maxillary glands (sinuses) had a nearly rectangular hollow with the dimensions , covered by a thick flap. The maxillary glands of the saola are probably the largest among those of all other animals. The glands are covered by a thick, pungent, grayish green, semi-solid secretion beneath which lies a sheath of few flat hairs. Robichaud observed several pores, used probably for secretion, on the upper surface of the lid. Each white facial spot shelters one or more nodules from which originate long white or black hairs. These secretions are typically rubbed against the underside of vegetation, leaving a musky, pungent paste. The spoor of the forelegs measured long by wide, and long by for the hindlegs.

Both sexes possess slightly divergent horns that are similar in appearance and form almost the same angle with the skull, but differ in their lengths. Horns resemble the parallel wooden posts locally used to support a spinning wheel (thus the familiar name &quot;spindlehorn&quot;). These are generally dark-brown or black and about 35–50 cm long; twice the length of their head. Studies in 1993 and 1995 gave the maximum distance between the horn tips of wild specimens as , but the female observed by Robichaud showed a divergence of between the tips. Robichaud noted that the horns were apart at the base. While studies prior to Robichaud&#x27;s claim the horns are uniformly circular in cross-section, Robichaud observed his specimen had horns with a nearly oval cross-section. The sides of the base of the horns is rugged and indented.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The saola has one of the smallest ranges of any large mammal. It inhabits wet evergreen or deciduous forests in eastern Southeast Asia, preferring river valleys. Sightings have been reported from steep river valleys at above sea level. In Vietnam and Laos, the species&#x27; range appears to cover approximately , including four nature reserves. During the winters, it migrates to the lowlands. In the northern Annamite Mountains, it was sighted mostly near streams at elevations of .

==Ecology and behaviour==
Local people reported that the saola is active in the day as well as at night, but prefers resting during the hot midday hours. Robichaud noted that the captive female was active mainly during the day, but pointed out that the observation could have been influenced by the unfamiliar surroundings the animal found herself in. When she rested, she would draw her forelegs inward to her belly, extend her neck so that her chin touched the ground, and close her eyes. Though apparently solitary, saola have been reported in groups of two or three as well as up to six or seven. Grouping patterns of the saola resemble those of the bushbuck, anoa, and sitatunga.

Robichaud observed that the captive female was calm in the presence of humans, but was afraid of dogs. On an encounter with a dog, she would resort to snorting and thrust her head forward, pointing her horns at her opponent. Her erect ears pointed backward, and she stood stiffly with her back arched. Meanwhile, she hardly paid any attention to her surroundings. This female was found to urinate and defecate separately, dropping her hind legs and lowering her lower body – a common observation among bovids. She would spend considerable time grooming herself with her strong tongue. Marking behaviour in the female involved opening up the flap of the maxillary gland and leaving a pungent secretion on rocks and vegetation. She would give out short bleats occasionally.

===Diet===
Robichaud offered spleenwort (&quot;Asplenium&quot;), &quot;Homalomena&quot;, and various species of broad-leaved shrubs or trees of the family Sterculiaceae to the captive animal. The saola fed on all plants, and showed a preference for the Sterculiaceae species. She did not pull at leaves, she would rather chew or pull them into her mouth using her long tongue. She fed mainly during the day, and rarely in the dark. The saola is also reputed to feed on &quot;Schismatoglottis&quot;, unlike other herbivores in its range.

===Reproduction===
Very little information is available about the reproductive cycle of the saola. The saola is likely to have a fixed mating season, from late August to mid-November; only single calf births have been documented, mainly during summer between mid-April and late June. In the absence of more specific data, the gestation period has been estimated as similar to that of &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; species, about 33 weeks. Three reports of saola killings from nearby villagers involved young accompanying mothers. One possessed long horns, another an estimated , and the third ; these varying horn lengths suggest a birth season extending over at least two to three months.

==Conservation==
The saola is currently considered to be critically endangered. Its restrictive habitat requirements and aversion to human proximity are likely to endanger it through habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Saola suffer losses through local hunting and the illegal trade in furs, traditional medicines, and for use of the meat in restaurants and food markets. They also sometimes get caught in snares that have been set to catch animals raiding crops, such as wild boar, sambar, and muntjac. More than 26,651 snares have so far been removed from saola habitats by conservation groups.

The key feature of the area occupied by the saola is its remoteness from human disturbance. Saola are shot for their meat, but hunters also gain high esteem in the village for the production of a carcass. Due to the scarcity, the locals place much more value on the saola than more common species. Because the people in this area are traditional hunters, their attitude about killing the saola is hard to change; this makes conservation difficult. The intense interest from the scientific community has actually motivated hunters to capture live specimens. Commercial logging has been stopped in the nature reserve area of Bu Huong, and there is an official ban on forest clearance within the boundaries of the reserve.

Species of conservation concern are frequently hard to study; there are often delays in implementing or identifying necessary conservation needs due to lack of data. Because the species is so rare, there is a continuous lack of adequate data; this is one of the major problems facing saola conservation. Trained scientists have never observed saola in the wild. Unfortunately, because it is unlikely that intact saola populations exist, field surveys to discover these populations are not a conservation priority.

The Saola Working Group was formed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission&#x27;s Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group, in 2006 to protect the saolas and their habitat. This coalition includes about 40 experts from the forestry departments of Laos and Vietnam, Vietnam&#x27;s Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vinh University, biologists and conservationists from Wildlife Conservation Society, and the World Wide Fund for Nature.

A group of scientists from the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in central Hanoi, within the Institute of Biotechnology, investigated a last resort effort of conserving the species by cloning, an extremely difficult approach even in the case of well-understood species. However, the lack of female saola donors of enucleated ovocytes and receptive females, as well as the interspecific barriers, greatly compromise the potential success of the cloning technique.

Researchers have stationed within villages around the Phou Sithon Endangered Species Conservation Area (PST) where saola have been spotted. Based on interviews that were conducted amongst the villagers, they have stated that poachers enter the restricted areas, illegally hunting the last saola. They have stressed the need for more human regulation to be enforced in order to keep the sustainability of wildlife in check.

==Culture==

The mascot of the 2021 Southeast Asian Games is &quot;Sao La&quot;. This design by Ngô Xuân Khôi defeated 557 other mascot submissions to emerge as the winner of the 2019 searching contest.

<text>The Fifth Council of the Lateran, held between 1512 and 1517, was the eighteenth ecumenical council of the Catholic Church and was the last council before the Protestant Reformation and the Council of Trent. This was the first time since 1213 that the Papal States would host an ecumenical council. It is so far the last time that Rome’s Lateran Palace (which had hosted 4 ecumenical councils in the past) has been the venue for such a event. 

It was convoked by Pope Julius II with a political motive of restoring peace between warring Catholic rulers and to re-assert the authority of the Pope.

After Pope Leo X took over in 1513, the Council attempted various institutional, dogmatic and social welfare reforms. Institutional reforms were intended to improve unity, reduce nepotism, absenteeism, disinterest, luxury and simony for high church officials, improve the training and regulation of priests, to strengthen the position of bishops over friars, and to assert the independence of the church and clergy from lay control. The social welfare reform allowed no-interest microfinance lending by monti di pietà.

These addressed some issues that had been raised by contemporary reformers, but were not the particular issues that the subsequent Protestant Reformation alighted on. As with the immediately previous Councils, its institutional reforms were ineffectively implemented at that time.

==Background==
When elected pope in 1503, Pope Julius II promised under oath to convoke a general council, but his promise was not fulfilled.

=== Political background ===

The Republic of Venice had encroached on papal rights in Venetian territories by independently filling vacant episcopal sees, subjecting clergy to secular tribunals and generally disregarding the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Julius II in other ways. In 1509, Julius II joined the League of Cambrai, a coalition formed to restore lands that had been recently conquered by Venice to their original owners. Julius II censured Venice with an interdict and deployed the armies of the Papal States, along with the combined forces of the League of Cambrai, to Venetian-occupied Romagna. There, Venice suffered a complete defeat at the Battle of Agnadello, on 14 May 1509. In 1510, Venice negotiated with Julius II, who withdrew from the League of Cambrai and removed the censure in exchange for terms that included Venice agreeing to return disputed towns in Romagna, to renounce claims to fill vacant benefices, to acknowledge jurisdiction of ecclesiastical tribunals over clergy and their immunity to secular tribunals including exemption from taxes, to revoke all unauthorised treaties made with towns in the Papal States, to abandon appeal to a future general council against the papal bans and to concede free navigation of the Adriatic Sea to Papal States subjects.

The first stages of conflict between the Papal States and France began in 1510. King Louis XII of France demanded that the Republic of Florence declare definitively its allegiance. However, declaring allegiance to France would expose Florence to an immediate attack, and alienate its citizens, who dreaded a conflict with the head of the Church. Additionally, Florence was full of antagonistic parties and irreconcilable interests. To gain time, Florence sent Niccolò Machiavelli on a diplomatic mission to France in July 1510, where he found Louis XII eager for war and inclined towards the idea of a general council to depose Julius II.

Julius II was a soldier, and his goal was to free the entire Italian Peninsula from subjection to foreign powers. However, only Venice and the Old Swiss Confederacy were ready to field armies against the French. Julius II began hostilities by deposing and excommunicating his vassal, Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, who supported France. Louis XII retaliated in September 1510 by convoking a synod of French bishops at Tours, which judged that the pope had no right to make war upon a foreign prince and if the pope undertook such a war, the foreign prince had the right to invade the Papal States and to withdraw his subjects&#x27; obedience to the pope. The synod also threatened Julius II with a general council. Julius II ignored the French synod and again assumed personal command of the army in Northern Italy. In August 1510, at Bologna, he became dangerously ill but then recovered. In October, he negotiated an anti-French alliance. In the beginning, the alliance included only the Papal States, Venice and Spain, but in November, England joined and was soon followed by the emperor and by Switzerland. The Papal States marched against Mirandola, which was captured on 20 January 1511. On 23 May 1511, contingents of the French army captured Bologna from the papal troops and reinstated Annibale II Bentivoglio.

Under the leadership of Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, the French were at first successful, but after his death, they yielded to the superior forces of the League. After being defeated in the Battle of Ravenna in 1512, they retreated beyond the Alps. Bologna again submitted to Julius II, and the cities of Parma, Reggio and Piacenza became part of the Papal States.

===&quot;&quot; of Pisa===

The reforms of the Council of Constance (1414–1418) and the Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence (1431–1449) failed. At the Synods of Orleans and Tours, in 1510, the French decided to convoke a general council. In view of the Council of Constance decree &#x27; and the delay of Julius II to convoke a general council as he had sworn in the papal conclave, the schismatic &#x27; convened at Pisa in 1511. Florence permitted the &#x27; to use Pisa as the location; this estranged Julius II, and both Florence and Pisa were placed under an interdict. According to Marco Pellegrini, the Gallican &#x27; &quot;shows how some members of the Sacred College were ever open to schismatic solutions&quot;.

According to Kraus, it was intended by French politicians to restrain Julius II, and to recognize by general council of the principles of the 1438 Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, drawn from the articles of the Council of Constance and the Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence. The schismatic &quot; at Pisa was attended by only a few prelates including Cardinals Bernardino López de Carvajal, Guillaume Briçonnet, Francesco Borgia, Federico Sanseverino, and René de Prie. They were encouraged by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and Louis XII. According to Shahan, dissatisfaction with treatment by Julius II, as well as subserviency to the excommunicate Louis XII, led Carvajal to that rebellious attitude. The council was held first in the choir of the San Michele in Borgo and then in that of the Cathedral of Pisa.

Maximilian I, who had planned since 1507 to procure his own election to the papacy after Julius died, at first gave his protection to the schismatic &quot; at Pisa. Then, he withdrew it, and the German bishops also refused to have anything to do with the schismatic tendencies of the French. On 18 July 1511, Julius II summoned a general council, the Fifth Lateran Council, at Rome; it assembled there on 19 April 1512, with a very small attendance that had only Italian prelates.

Julius deprived the four leading schismatic cardinals of their dignities, deposed them from their offices and excommunicated the &quot; participants.

After the &quot; transferred from Pisa to Milan because of popular opposition, possibly elected Carvajal as Antipope Martin VI.

Soon afterward, in 1512, fearing the Swiss mercenaries invasion of the French occupied Duchy of Milan, the &#x27; participants departed to Asti and then Lyon, France, where they abandoned the &#x27; later that year.

The schismatic &quot;&quot; was a political step aimed at Julius II, who was involved in conflict with the Duchy of Ferrara and France. The whole matter was a futile attempt to revive 15th century conciliarism and to use it for political purposes.

===Convocation of Lateran Council===
Julius II was quick to oppose the &#x27; and convoked a general council by a papal bull of 18 July 1511, which was to meet on 19 April 1512 in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, in Rome. The bull not only was a canonical document but also was polemical in content. Julius refuted the allegation by the cardinals for their Pisa &#x27;. He declared that his promise before his election as pope was sincere; that since he became pope, he had always sought to call a general council; that to prepare the general council, he had endeavored to bring an end to quarrels between rulers; that subsequent wars had made calling the council inopportune. Julius then reproached the participants at Pisa for their lack of respect by calling a council without the pope, who was supposed to lead. He also said that the three months of preparation for Pisa was not enough. Finally, he declared that no one should attach any significance to the statements made at Pisa.

A war of polemics was waged about the councils, pitting Thomas Cajetan, the Dominican Master General, on the papal side against the conciliarist arguments of Jacques Almain, the spokesman of the University of Paris.

France&#x27;s victory over the Papal States and the Spanish Empire at the Battle of Ravenna (1512) hindered the opening of the council called by Julius II.

During the council, the ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor announced that Maximilian had rejected the decisions made by the &quot;&quot; at Pisa, and a similar announcement was made by Louis XII&#x27;s ambassador. At the seventh session, in 1513, Carvajal and Sanseverino separated from their French colleagues and formally renounced the schism, and they were restored by Leo X to their offices.

Alessandro Geraldini, the first Archbishop of Santo Domingo, attended the eleventh session, likely making him to first prelate from the Western Hemisphere to attend an Ecumenical Council.

== Location ==
The arrangements for the council were done by the papal master of ceremonies Paride de Grassi, who prepared by reaching out to several individuals who had knowledge of the proceeding and structures for previous councils, such as Constance and Florence. De Grassi constructed a main council chamber inside the nave of the Lateran Basilica. This chamber was surrounded by a wall to protect the privacy of the proceedings. Rooms for eating and latrines were constructed within it, as the participants could not leave the premises during the council. A second smaller room was constructed in the &quot;aula concilii&quot; in the Lateran Palace, and was designed for the purpose of having a smaller locations were the pope, cardinals, emperors, and other high-ranking members could enjoy more privacy. However, the &quot;aula concilii&quot; housed only one meeting and no formal sessions were conducted in it. The details of the room, measurements, structures, and facilities were reconstructed by scholar Nelson Minnich, who heavily relied on the diaries of Paride De Grassi himself.

==Meetings and decision==

The Council finally met on 3 May 1512 at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. The scholar and preacher Cardinal Egidio da Viterbo (Giles of Viterbo) gave an inspiring opening address on the need for urgent reform, which was widely printed and puts many of the concerns of Catholic reformists and humanists, such as Ximenez, von Staupitz, John Colet and Erasmus.

Participants included fifteen cardinals, the Latin patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, ten archbishops, fifty-six bishops, some abbots and generals of religious orders, the ambassadors of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and those of Venice and of Florence. After Julius II died, his successor, Pope Leo X, continued the council, and the last session was held on 16 March 1517.

Several decrees were published, most for institutional reform and political peace rather than doctrinal clarification, including:
*A rejection and condemnation of the &quot;&quot; of Pisa, quashing everything done by it.
* The nullification of a Papal election where simony is exposed.
* An invitation to Hussites to attend and negotiate re-integration, with better security guarantees.
* Establishing age limits (over 30) for bishops: this was aimed reducing nepotism and absentee bishops. The Council encouraged cardinal-nephews.
* Establishing better criteria for abbots.
* Establishing peer review by cardinals of each others&#x27; visitation reports.
* Stricter regulation of the Roman curia.
* Sumptuory regulations for cardinals and bishops.
* A confirmation of the excommunications of cardinals by Julius II (1512).
* &quot;Inter multiplices&quot;, a Bull promulgated by Leo X on 4 May 1515, sanctioning the &quot;&quot;: financial institutions under strict ecclesiastical supervision, which provided loans to the needy in the manner of pawn shops and had attracted both support and opposition from within the church since their establishment in the previous century;
* &quot;Apostolici Regiminis&quot;, on the immortality of the soul, usually believed to have been directed against Pietro Pomponazzi
* One concerning the freedom of the Church and the dignity of bishops, that lay people have no power over clerics. Also that bishops have authority over friars in their churches.
* A requirement that a local bishop give permission before the printing of a new book.
* Confirmation of the contemporaneous 1516 Concordat of Bologna between the Holy See and the Kingdom of France and abrogation of the 1438 Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges.
* A lengthy section calling for peace between princes, and that everyone with any influence must do so.
* Advocation of war against the Turks to reclaim the Holy Land, to be funded by three years of tax levies.
* Condemnation of all propositions contradicting &quot;the truth of the enlightened Christian faith&quot;, restrictions on clergy teachings about the &quot;nature of the rational soul&quot; and regulation of university course sequences for clerics&#x27; studies in philosophy and poetry. A call to all philosophy teachers to complement any lesson that contradicts the Christian faith with &quot;convincing arguments&quot; from the Christian point of view.
*Requirement for documented competence in preaching.
*Apocolyptic preaching was forbidden.

==Effect==
Little was done to put the work of the council into practice. In the view of a Franciscan teacher:

The Vatican website introduction to the session reports of the Council notes that while reform of the curia failed, suppression of the Pisa pseudo-council succeeded, though the small number of attending bishops had raised questions about its status as a true &quot;ecumenical&quot; council.

The Pope&#x27;s need for more money to finance military operations against the Turks in the Holy Lands and to re-establish Rome&#x27;s prestige and centrality, which underpins several of the Council&#x27;s discussions, was behind the so-called &quot;sale of indulgences&quot; scandal that precipitated Martin Luther&#x27;s Ninety-five Theses, which were published just seven months after the close of the council. According to historian Nelson Minnich, Luther was shocked that the Lateran Council had in his view abrogated decisions of previous councils and he adopted &quot;sola scriptura&quot; in consequence. Whether or not the Protestant Reformation could have been avoided if the reforms had been implemented is a matter of debate.

<text>Bellpuig () is a town in the &quot;comarca&quot; (county) of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain.

Nowadays Bellpuig is the third-most-important town in the area of Urgell. The town, located between the three little hills appearing on the flag, is served by Bellpuig railway station.

== People ==
Bellpuig in 1487 was the birthplace of Ramón de Cardona, Baron of Bellpuig, Count of Alvito and Duke of Somma (in Catalan, &quot;Ramon Folc III de Cardona-Anglesola&quot;). He was a Catalan general of the Holy League troops and viceroy of Naples from 1509 to 1522. His funeral monument is in Bellpuig, where his body was transported nine years after his death on 10 March 1522. The monument was designed and built by Giovanni da Nola and Genoese master sculptors, it is one of the most important examples of Renaissance art in Spain.

==Events==
The Festival of the Verge dels Dolors takes place every year and includes a religious procession. This celebration is more than 300 years old.

==Sports==
The village has one of the most important Motocross facilities in the south of Europe. The Circuit de Motocros Montperler held many national and international competitions in the past.

<text>William Cumming Rose (April 4, 1887 – September 25, 1985) was an American biochemist and nutritionist. He discovered the amino acid threonine, and his research determined the necessity for essential amino acids in diet and the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.

==Early life==
William Cumming Rose was born in Greenville, South Carolina. He attended various local schools, but his father John M. Rose, who was a Presbyterian minister, began to homeschool William in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew when he was 14 years old. He also studied an introductory chemistry textbook by Ira Remsen. When he was 16, he studied at Davidson College in North Carolina for his bachelor&#x27;s degree. He took up graduate education at Yale University studying food chemistry with Russell Chittenden and Lafayette Mendel. He was granted a PhD in 1911.

==Career==
Rose taught for a time at University of Pennsylvania with Alonzo E. Taylor. Taylor recommended him to University of Texas Galveston Medical School to organize a department of biochemistry. In 1922, he went to the University of Illinois as professor of physiological chemistry, a title which was changed to professor of biochemistry in 1936. From 1922 to 1955 he transformed his department into a center of excellence for the training of biochemists.

At Illinois, Rose focused his research work on amino acid metabolism and nutrition. He found that the 19 amino acids then known were not sufficient for growth, and this led to his discovery in 1935 of the last of the common amino acids, α-amino-β-hydroxy-n-butyric acid, later named threonine. His studies also distinguished the amino acids that are absolutely essential from those that are necessary only for optimal growth. His studies further led him to the point where it was &quot;practicable to evaluate proteins in terms of their ability to meet human needs.&quot; In June 1949 he published &quot;Amino Acid Requirements of Man&quot;.

Rose served as President of the American Society of Biological Chemists from 1939 to 1941. He was appointed to the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, which advised government agencies on dietary recommendations. Rose retired from the University of Illinois in 1955.

He recalled the role of Yale through the work of Samuel William Johnson, Chittenden, and Mendel in 1977 with the article &quot;Recollections of personalities involved in the early history of American biochemistry&quot;. Further, he recounted the biochemical advances he witnessed in &quot;How did it happen&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

<doc id="922754" wikidata="Q5167602" url="?curid=922754" title="Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Coombe Hill is a hill in The Chilterns, located next to the hamlet of Dunsmore, Buckinghamshire, England, near the small town of Wendover, and overlooking Aylesbury Vale. It is not to be confused with another Coombe Hill on the flank of Haddington Hill, some to the north-east. It is part of the Bacombe and Coombe Hills Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The majority of the hill (an area of ) once formed part of the Chequers Estate but was presented to the National Trust by the United Kingdom government when they were given the Estate in the 1920s. The summit of the hill is above sea level.

==Coombe Hill Monument – Second Boer War ==
For most of human history, war memorials were erected to commemorate great victories; remembering the dead was a secondary concern. Coombe Hill Monument is one of the first and largest examples of a war memorial erected to honour the names of individual men who fell whilst fighting for their country. The monument is an iconic Buckinghamshire landmark and a Grade II listed monument. At above sea level, it sits on one of the highest and most striking spurs of the Chilterns, commanding a wide view of the Vale of Aylesbury. On a clear day, it can be seen from the Berkshire Downs and the Cotswolds to the west. The view overlooks Chequers, the country home of the Prime Minister.

The monument was erected in 1904, by public subscription, in memory of 148 men from Buckinghamshire who died during the Second Boer War. Coombe Hill Monument was almost totally destroyed by lightning in 1938 and was rebuilt in the same year. The original bronze plaque and decorations were stolen in 1972 and replaced with a stone plaque and iron flag. The new stone plaque was also inscribed with the additional names of nine men believed to have been missing on the original. The monument was again badly damaged by a lightning strike in the early 1990s and spent several months in repair. It is now equipped with conductors to prevent this from happening again. The monument and a few square metres of surrounding land are owned by Buckinghamshire County Council.

The monument is a Grade II a listed building designated in 1985.

==The 2010 restoration==
On 21 October 2010, the monument was rededicated after substantial restoration work. The work was done by Buckinghamshire County Council with funds raised by the Coombe Hill Monument Appeal Committee. The committee consisted of: 
The Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, Sir Henry Aubrey Fletcher Bt JP (Patron);
Major General Stuart Watson CBE (Chairman);
Mark Bailey, Buckinghamshire County Council (Project Manager);
Lt Col (Retd) Ingram Murray, Honorary Secretary of the Friends of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry;
Patricia Birchley, Elected Member, Chiltern Ridges; 
Johanna Sienkiewicz, local resident, Project Researcher; 
Chris Arnold, Ellesborough Parish Council; 
Pam Priestley, Elected Member Wycombe District Council; 
Paul Rogerson, Elected Member, Buckinghamshire County Council; and
Neil Harris, The National Trust

A new plaque corrects spelling errors in the original and adds 2 names that were previously omitted. The memorial was deep-cleaned, weathered joints were replaced, fresh gold leaf has been applied to the finial, and the county crest and bronze flags above the plaque have been restored.

==Triangulation point and plaque==
In front of the monument was a rectangular concrete pillar that was the trig point and topped with a metal plaque donated in 1988 that pointed to true north and to the following distant features: The Cotswolds (), Brill Hill (13 miles), Waddesdon Manor (), Calvert Chimneys (), Aylesbury Church (), Mursley Water Tower (), Wingrave Church (), Leighton Buzzard (), Mentmore (), Edlesborough Church () and Ivinghoe Beacon ().

The trig point and its toposcope were heavily damaged, bordering on being totally destroyed, by vandals in early October 2018.

==Flora and fauna==
Coombe Hill has 3 different types of land including acid heathland, chalk grassland and deciduous woodland. It is home to much interesting wildlife — including red kites, yellowhammers and firecrests. It also holds the habitat to many rare plants such as heather, orchids and the Chiltern gentian. Due to its rarity the acid moorland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

==Coombe Hill Run==
A running race organised by the Vale of Aylesbury Athletic Club which includes of climbing up to the monument on Coombe Hill, the Coombe Hill Run is a rare example of a fell race in southern Britain. First held in 1973, and now held on the first Sunday in June, it attracts more than 150 runners.

==Origin of name==
The word &quot;coombe&quot; is of Brythonic origin and means &quot;hollow&quot;.

<text>Chronos ( ) is a 1985 abstract film directed by Ron Fricke, created with custom-built time-lapse cameras. Originally released in IMAX theaters, it is now available on DVD, Blu-ray and HD DVD.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Chronos&quot; is 42 minutes long and has no actors or dialogue. The soundtrack consists of a single continuous piece by composer Michael Stearns. Filmed in dozens of locations on five continents, the film relates to the concept of time passing on different scales—the bulk of the film covers the history of civilization, from pre-history to Egypt to Rome to Late Antiquity to the rise of Western Europe in the Middle Ages to the Renaissance to the modern era. It centers on European themes but not exclusively. Other time scales include the passing of seasons, the passing of night and day, and the passing shadows of the sun in an afternoon to the passing of people on the street. These themes are intermingled with symbolic meaning.

==Background==
&quot;Chronos&quot; shares its particular style with the film &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; (1982), for which Ron Fricke was the cinematographer, as well as his later films &quot;Sacred Site&quot; and &quot;Baraka&quot; (1992). The theme of the film is &quot;the celebration of life&quot;, and does not include the themes of technology as the culprit for society or &quot;life out of balance&quot;, which were present in &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;. &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; described the film as &quot;a musical poem praising the evolution of Western man from Cairo to Los Angeles.&quot; The film was produced by Canticle Films, a production company founded by Fricke. Funding for &quot;Chronos&quot; came from the seed money acquired through the publicity surrounding the production of &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;.

Fricke designed and built a 65 mm camera for the film, which included a motion control system for the film&#x27;s cinematography. The director also used the system in his later films.

Michael Stearns, while composing the soundtrack for the film, used a custom-made instrument called &quot;The Beam&quot; to generate many of the sounds he required. The Beam was long, made of extruded aluminum with 24 piano strings of gauge 19-22.

The name of the film comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;χρόνος&quot;, &quot;krònos&quot;, which means &quot;time&quot; and is also the source to many modern terms related to time, such as chronology, synchronous, etc.

<doc id="922757" wikidata="Q311375" url="?curid=922757" title="Tragelaphus">
<text>Tragelaphus is a genus of medium-to-large-sized spiral-horned antelopes. It contains several species of bovines, all of which are relatively antelope-like. Species in this genus tend to be large in size and lightly built, and have long necks and considerable sexual dimorphism. Elands, including the common eland (&quot;Taurotragus oryx&quot;), are embedded within this genus, meaning that &quot;Taurotragus&quot; must be subsumed into &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; to avoid paraphyly. Alternatively, &quot;Taurotragus&quot; could be maintained as a separate genus, if the nyala and the lesser kudu are relocated to their own monospecific genera, respectively &quot;Nyala&quot; and &quot;Ammelaphus&quot;. &quot;Strepsiceros&quot; is a generic synonym. Genus &quot;Boocercus&quot; formerly contained &quot;T. eurycerus&quot;. The name &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; comes from the mythical tragelaph.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

&quot;Tragelaphus&quot; is a genus in the tribe Tragelaphini and the family Bovidae. The genus authority is French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, who first mentioned it in the journal &quot;Bulletin des Sciences, par la Société Philomatique&quot; in 1816. The name is not of modern scientific invention, but comes from ancient Greek τραγέλαφος (&quot;tragélaphos&quot;), from τράγος (&quot;trágos&quot;), meaning a &quot;male goat&quot;, and ἔλαφος (&quot;élaphos&quot;), meaning a &quot;deer&quot;.
==Extant species==
It is generally treated as having eight species, namely:.
An alternative classification, supported by genetic data, would recognise 11 species in five groups, which could be treated as subgenera or full genera: (i) &quot;Nyala&quot; for &quot;T. angasii&quot;; (ii) &quot;Ammelaphus&quot; for &quot;T. imberbis&quot;; (iii) &quot;Taurotragus&quot; for the two elands (&quot;T. oryx&quot; and &quot;T. derbianus&quot;); (iv) &quot;Strepsiceros&quot; for &quot;T. strepsiceros&quot; and (v) &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; restricted to &quot;T. buxtoni&quot;, &quot;T. spekei&quot;, &quot;T. scriptus&quot;, &quot;T. sylvaticus&quot; (Imbabala - separated from a polyphyletic &quot;T. scriptus&quot;) and &quot;T. eurycerus&quot;. In terms of divergence time estimates, a 2006 study showed that core &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; (now known to excude &quot;T. angasii&quot; and &quot;T. imberbis&quot;) diverged from &quot;Taurotragus&quot; (elands) towards the end of the Late Miocene.

<text>The canals of the United Kingdom are a major part of the network of inland waterways in the United Kingdom. They have a varied history, from use for irrigation and transport, through becoming the focus of the Industrial Revolution, to today&#x27;s role of recreational boating. Despite a period of abandonment, today the canal system in the United Kingdom is again increasing in use, with abandoned and derelict canals being reopened, and the construction of some new routes. Canals in England and Wales are maintained by navigation authorities. The biggest navigation authorities are the Canal &amp; River Trust and the Environment Agency, but other canals are managed by companies, local authorities or charitable trusts.

The majority of canals in the United Kingdom can accommodate boats with a length of between and are now used primarily for leisure. There are a number of canals which are far larger than this, including New Junction Canal and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which can accommodate boats with a length of up to . An incomparable purpose-built ship canal is the Manchester Ship Canal. Upon opening in 1894, it was the largest ship canal in the world, permitting ships with a length of up to to navigate its route.

==History of commercial carrying==
Canals first saw use during the Roman occupation of the south of Great Britain and were used mainly for irrigation. The Romans also created several navigable canals, such as Foss Dyke, to link rivers, enabling increased transport inland by water.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s navigable water network grew as the demand for industrial transport increased. The canals were key to the pace of the Industrial Revolution: roads at the time were unsuitable for large volumes of traffic. A system of very large pack horse trains had developed, but few roads were suitable for wheeled vehicles able to transport large amounts of materials (especially fragile manufactured goods such as pottery) quickly. Canal boats were much quicker, could carry large volumes, and were much safer for fragile items. Following the success of first the Sankey Canal followed by the Bridgewater Canal, other canals were constructed between industrial centres, cities and ports, and were soon transporting raw materials (particularly coal and lumber) and manufactured goods. There were immediate benefits to households, as well as to commerce: in Manchester, the cost of coal fell by 75% when the Bridgewater Canal arrived.

As the Industrial Revolution took hold in the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the technology allowed canals to be improved. The early canals contoured round hills and valleys, later ones went straighter. Locks took canals up and down hills, and they strode across valleys on taller and longer aqueducts and through hills in longer and deeper tunnels.

From the mid-19th century, railways began to replace canals, especially those built with the standard narrow () bridges and locks. As trains, and later road vehicles, became more advanced, they became cheaper than the narrow canal system, being faster, and able to carry much larger cargoes. The canal network declined, and many canals were bought by railway companies – in some cases to enable them to penetrate rival companies&#x27; areas transhipping to/from canal boats. Some narrow canals became unusable, filled with weeds, silt and rubbish, or were converted to railways.

There was a late burst of wide-waterway building (e.g. the Caledonian Canal, and the Manchester Ship Canal), and of invention and innovation by people such as Bartholomew of the Aire and Calder company, who conceived the trains of nineteen coal-filled &quot;Tom Pudding&quot; compartment boats that were pulled along the Aire and Calder Navigation from the Yorkshire coalfields, then lifted bodily to upturn their contents directly into seagoing colliers at Goole Docks (their descendants, Hargreaves&#x27; tugs pushing three coal-pans trains to be upended into hoppers at the Aire power stations lasted as late as 2004). However, the last new canal before the end of the 20th century was the New Junction Canal in Yorkshire (now South Yorkshire) in 1905. As competition intensified, horse-drawn single narrowboats were replaced by steam and later diesel powered boats towing an unpowered butty, and many of the boatmen&#x27;s families abandoned their shore homes for a life afloat, to help with boat handling and to reduce accommodation costs – the birth of the &quot;boatman&#x27;s cabin&quot; with bright white lace, gleaming brass and gaily-painted metalware. A trip on the canal system was described colloquially as &quot;a cruise on the cut&quot;.

Constant lowering of tolls meant that the carriage of some bulky, non-perishable, and non-vital goods by water was still feasible on some inland waterways – but the death knell for commercial carrying on the narrow canals was sounded in the winter of 1962–63, when a long hard frost kept goods icebound on the canals for three months. A few of the remaining customers turned to road and rail haulage to ensure reliability of supply and never returned, though both rail and road had been severely disrupted by the frost and snow too. Other narrowboat traffic gradually ceased with the change from coal to oil, the closure of canalside factories, and run-down of British heavy industry. The last long-distance narrowboat traffics, coal from the Midlands to Dickinson&#x27;s paper mills at Croxley and the Kearley and Tonge jam factory at Southall both ceased in 1970 – the Croxley mills had changed to oil and the jam factory closed for re-location. Regular narrowboat traffics continued, such as lime juice from Brentford to Boxmoor (until 1981) while aggregates were carried on the River Soar until 1988.

Some individual waterways (especially the Manchester Ship Canal, the Aire and Calder Navigation and the other large waterways) remain viable, carrying many millions of tonnes per year and there are still hopes for development, but containerisation of ports and lorries has mostly passed the waterways by. The last major investment development of the inland waterways was the enlargement of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation in the early 1980s to cope with barges of standard European dimensions that never came. There have been a number of successful initiatives to get more traffic on to the larger inland waterways, though even the Manchester Ship Canal does not convey cargo ships to the docks in Salford, which have become little more than a water feature for the apartments, offices and cultural institutions of &#x27;Salford Quays&#x27; that have replaced the wharves and warehouses.

==Growth of leisure use==

Early use of the canals for leisure travel was fairly limited. One of the earliest records of pleasure cruising was published in 1891. &quot;Two Girls on a Barge&quot; by Miss V. Cecil Cotes describes an unconventional adventure by two young ladies who took a barge from Paddington to Coventry. With the introduction of motor boats, George Westall authored a book in 1908, &quot;Inland Cruising on the Rivers and Canals of England and Wales&quot; which was published by Lander, Westall and Co. In 1916, P. Bonthron published &quot;My Holidays on Inland Waterways&quot; which described his adventures covering 2,000 miles of inland waterways in his motor boat.

In the latter half of the 20th century, while the use of canals for transporting goods was dying out, there was a rise in interest in their history and potential use for leisure. A large amount of credit for this is usually given to L. T. C. Rolt, whose book &quot;Narrow Boat&quot; about a journey made in the narrowboat &quot;Cressy&quot; was published in 1944. A key development was the foundation of the Inland Waterways Association, and the establishment of fledgling weekly boat-hire companies, following the example of such companies on the Norfolk Broads, which had long been used for leisure boating. The authority responsible for the canals, the British Waterways Board, encouraged this process from the late 1950s by operating a fleet of holiday hire boats, initially converted from cut-down working boats.

Holidaymakers began renting &#x27;narrowboats&#x27; and roaming the canals, visiting towns and villages they passed. Richer people bought boats to use for weekend breaks and the occasional longer trip. The concept of a canal holiday became even more familiar when the large agencies that dealt with Broads holidays began to include canal boatyards in their brochures. Canal-based holidays became popular due to their relaxing nature, self-catering levels of cost, and variety of scenery available; from inner London to the Scottish Highlands. This growth in interest came just in time to give local canal societies the ammunition they needed to combat government proposals in the 1960s to close commercially unviable canals, and to resist pressure from local authorities and newspapers to &quot;fill in this eyesore&quot; or even to &quot;close the killer canal&quot; (when someone fell in one). It was not long before enthusiastic volunteers were repairing unnavigable but officially open canals and moving on to restore officially closed ones and demonstrating their renewed viability to the authorities.

Local authorities began to see how a cleaned-up and well-used waterway was bringing visitors to other towns and waterside pubs – not just boaters, but people who just like being near water and watching boats (see gongoozler). They began to clean up their own watersides, and to campaign for &quot;their&quot; canal to be restored. As a result of this growing revival of interest, for the first time in a century some new routes have been constructed (the Ribble Link and the Liverpool Canal Link), another is under construction (the Fens Waterways Link). Large projects such as the restoration of the Anderton Boat Lift, or the building of the Falkirk Wheel attracted development funding from the European Union and from the Millennium Fund. The Rochdale Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Droitwich Canals have all been restored to navigation since 2000.

==Present status==

There are now about of navigable canals and rivers throughout the United Kingdom; 2,700 miles (4,345 km) of these are part of the connected system. Most of them are linked into a single English and Welsh network from Bristol to London, Liverpool to Goole and Lancaster to Ripon, and connecting the Irish Sea, the North Sea, the estuaries of the Humber, Thames, Mersey, Severn and Ribble. This network is navigable in its entirety by a narrowboat (a boat wide) no longer than about . There are also several through-routes not connected to the main network, notably those in Scotland, e.g., Glasgow to Edinburgh via the Forth and Clyde Canal, the Falkirk Wheel, and the Union Canal; and Fort William to Inverness via the Caledonian Canal (including Loch Lochy, Loch Oich, and Loch Ness).

There are four separate sections of the inland canal network accessible to wide or broad-beam boats of around wide (though two each are linked by tidal waterways). However, long-term proposed and already underway restorations and constructions of new routes would eventually link these sections, enabling wide boats to move freely between them and create a true north–south east–west network.

The aim of campaigning bodies such as the Inland Waterways Association is to protect the existing waterways and help restore once-navigable waterways. In May 2005, it was reported that British Waterways (the predecessor to the Canal &amp; River Trust) was hoping to quadruple the amount of cargo carried on Britain&#x27;s canal network to six million tonnes by 2010 by transporting large amounts of waste to disposal facilities.

The speed limit for the majority of inland waterways in the United Kingdom managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust is . All speed measurements on Canal &amp; River Trust waterways are expressed in terms of speed over the ground, rather than speed through the water.

==Canal features==

===Aqueducts===

Canal aqueducts are structures that carry a canal across a valley, road, railway, or another canal. Dundas Aqueduct is built of stone in a classical style. Pontcysyllte Aqueduct is an iron trough on tall stone piers. Barton Swing Aqueduct opens to let ships pass underneath on the Manchester Ship Canal. Three Bridges, London is an arrangement allowing the routes of the Grand Junction Canal, a road, and a railway line to cross each other.

===Boat lifts===
*Anderton Boat Lift
*Falkirk Wheel
*Combe Hay Caisson Lock

===Inclined planes===
*Hay Inclined Plane
*Foxton Inclined Plane
*Worsley Underground Incline

===Locks===
Locks are the most common means of raising or lowering a boat from one water level to another. The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber whose water-level can be changed.

Where a large height difference has to be overcome, locks are built close together in a flight such as at Caen Hill Locks. Where the gradient is very steep, a set of staircase locks are sometimes used, like Bingley Five Rise Locks. At the other extreme stop locks have little or no change in level but were built to conserve water where one canal joined another. An interesting example is King&#x27;s Norton Stop Lock which was built with guillotine gates.

<doc id="922766" wikidata="Q18914832" url="?curid=922766" title="Horatio">
<text>Horatio is an English male given name, an Italianized form of the ancient Roman Latin &quot;nomen&quot; (name) &quot;Horatius&quot;, from the Roman &quot;gens&quot; (clan) &quot;Horatia&quot;. The modern Italian form is &quot;Orazio&quot;, the modern Spanish form &quot;Horacio&quot;. It appears to have been first used in England in 1565, in the Tudor era during which the Italian Renaissance movement had started to influence English culture. The name Horace is another related name from the same Latin source.

== History ==

Prominent English-language examples of the name &quot;Horatio&quot; include:
Horatio de Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury (1565–1635), an English military leader, was one of the earliest English holders of the name, born 34 years before Shakespeare invented the character Horatio in his 1599/1601 play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He was a grandfather of Horatio Townshend, 1st Viscount Townshend (1630–1687), whose son Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (a ward of Col. Robert Walpole (1650–1700) of Houghton Hall in Norfolk) married Dorothy Walpole, one of the latter&#x27;s daughters and a sister of Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole (1678–1757) (and of Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford (1676–1745), the Prime Minister). The name Horatio was subsequently much used by the Walpole family and by the 1st Baron Walpole&#x27;s illustrious younger cousin Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758–1805), his father&#x27;s great-great grandson, born one year after 1st Baron Walpole&#x27;s death. The 1st Baron Walpole&#x27;s son, Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, 2nd Baron Walpole (1723–1809) served as a godfather at the christening of Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1758, who for that reason, as was common, was given his name. The Admiral died without issue, but his great-nephew Horatio Nelson, 3rd Earl Nelson (1823–1913) (born with the surname &quot;Bolton&quot;, eventual heir and great-nephew of the Admiral&#x27;s elder brother William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson, heir of the Admiral) carried on the name.

<doc id="922768" wikidata="Q4778932" url="?curid=922768" title="Apache May Slaughter">
<text>Apache May Slaughter ( 1895 – 1900) was the adopted daughter of Tombstone, Arizona sheriff John Slaughter and his wife Viola.

Apache May was found by John Slaughter as he was following a group of Apaches in Mexico. She had been abandoned to her luck by her natural parents. John Slaughter returned to Arizona with Apache May. When she was adopted by the couple, she also became Daniel Boone&#x27;s great great great granddaughter.

Apache May&#x27;s name came from her background, and her month of birth. Calculating her age, the Slaughters were convinced she was born in the month of May of that year.

==Young Celebrity==
Apache May Slaughter became a young celebrity across Arizona, because many newspapers and publications speculated about the girl&#x27;s natural parents, her relation to the Apaches and whether those factors would affect her personality in the future and turn her into a violent person without morals. Photographers were no strangers to the small girl; she was constantly pictured and appeared in most Arizona publications of the era.

The Slaughters loved Apache May. She usually wore dresses made out of posters of different kinds. These were chosen for her by the Slaughters, who supposed that she would look outstanding in the small dresses.

Apache May died at the Slaughters&#x27; San Bernardino Ranch when one of her dresses caught fire as she was playing near a pot with boiling water.

<text>The International Celtic Congress (, , , , , ) is a cultural organisation that seeks to promote the Celtic languages of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall and the Isle of Man. The International Celtic Congress is a non-political charitable organisation and its stated object is to &quot;... perpetuate the culture, ideals, and languages of the Celtic peoples, and to maintain an intellectual contact and close cooperation between the respective Celtic communities.&quot;

The Celtic Congress should not be confused with the Celtic League which also focuses on political matters, although the two organisations share a number of objectives. Like the Celtic League, it tries to &quot;hold... an annual international congress in one of the six Celtic countries, if possible according to a fixed rotation&quot;. The Celtic League itself, split off the Celtic Congress amicably, to pursue political aims, and many people are members of both.

There is an International Celtic Congress each year in one of the Celtic countries. The 2020 Congress, initially planned for Aberystwyth, Wales was cancelled in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 2021 Congress, also planned for Aberystwyth, was hosted online.

Following a meeting at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1900, the first Pan-Celtic Congress was held in Dublin in 1901, at that time it was proposed to make the Congress a triennial event. In 1904 Cornwall became a member of the Pan-Celtic Congress.

==History==
The Celtic Congress was founded in 1917 by Edward John, a Welsh nationalist who was an MP for East Denbighshire from 1910 until 1918. He was motivated in part by the ideal of reviving the work of the earlier Celtic Association and its annual Pan-Celtic Congresses, but was also influenced by the social and culture aftermath of the First World War. The new Celtic Congress held its first meeting in 1917 at the Birkenhead Eisteddfod. The Congress was held in Edinburgh in 1920, and in 1921 on the Isle of Man. In 1925 the Congress was held in Dublin, where one of the speakers was Douglas Hyde. A prominent figure was Agnes O&#x27;Farrelly, who was also part of the Gaelic League and for a while was a member of &quot;Cumann na mBan&quot;. She played a major role in the organisation after John&#x27;s death in 1931.

In 1935, Cardiff was the venue, and BBC Western Region broadcast the proceedings. The 1938 Congress was held on Isle of Man in different halls, so that attendees had a choice of lectures, debates and discussions. 
Meetings were irregular before World War II although in the 1920s, the National Party of Scotland (the forerunner of the modern Scottish National Party) sought involvement, and the then Taoiseach of Ireland, Éamon de Valera consented to be a patron of the organisation in the 1930s.

There had been an eleven-year gap before the August 1949 Celtic Congress at Bangor, Wales where delegates included Sir Ifor Williams and Conor Maguire, Chief Justice of Ireland. Meetings have been held almost every year since then. The Celtic Congress of 1950, held at the Royal Institution of Cornwall in Truro, was a catalyst for the foundation of Mebyon Kernow the following year. The Wales branch hosted the meeting at Aberystwyth in 1960.

Each of the six branches is independent with their own programmes of activities during the year. The Conference is held in each of the six countries in turn, and the country that is hosting the conference has the privilege of choosing the theme of the lectures for that year. An International Celtic Congress involves lectures, visits to places of cultural and historic interest, and music and dance events.

<text>Papa Roach is an American rock band from Vacaville, California, formed in 1993. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, guitarist Jerry Horton, drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.

After releasing two EPs, James departed and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two additional EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999, subsequently releasing the triple-platinum &quot;Infest&quot; in 2000, the gold album &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot; in 2002, and the platinum album &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot; in 2004. Following the release of &quot;The Paramour Sessions&quot; in 2006, Buckner left the band in 2007 and was succeeded by Tony Palermo. Papa Roach then released &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (2009), &quot;Time for Annihilation&quot; (2010), &quot;The Connection&quot; (2012), &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; (2015), &quot;Crooked Teeth&quot; (2017), and &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; (2019). The group&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Ego Trip&quot;, was released in 2022.

==History==

===Early years (1993–1995)===
Papa Roach&#x27;s formation began in January 1993 when lead singer Jacoby Shaddix and drummer Dave Buckner met on the Vacaville High School football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist Jerry Horton from nearby Vanden High School, rhythm guitarist Anne Mikolajcik, trombonist Ben Luther, and bassist Will James. They decided to enter the school&#x27;s talent show, performing a rendition of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s song &quot;Fire&quot;. Ultimately, they did not win the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band, followed by Anne Mikolajcik. During this period, Papa Roach practiced daily and toured extensively, playing every gig they could secure. The band&#x27;s first tour van was named Moby Dick, which inspired Shaddix to adopt his initial stage name, &quot;Coby Dick.&quot; Initially, the band was called &quot;Papa Gato,&quot; as suggested by Buckner, but Shaddix changed it to Papa Roach, combining the nickname of his maternal grandfather, Herbert Fischer &quot;Papa,&quot; with &quot;Roach,&quot; derived from his paternal grandfather, John &quot;Grandpa&quot; Roatch. Both grandparents were musicians.

In 1994, Papa Roach released its first EP, titled &quot;Potatoes for Christmas&quot;. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown while he spent the year in Seattle, studying art. In 1995, the band released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled &quot;Caca Bonita&quot;. By this time, Buckner had returned. In 1996, the group replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James&#x27; involvement in a church summer camp limited the band&#x27;s summer rehearsals and touring.

===&quot;Old Friends from Young Years&quot; and record deal (1996–1999)===
On February 4, 1997, the band&#x27;s debut studio album, titled &quot;Old Friends from Young Years&quot;, was released. At this time, the group was actively touring, supporting bands such as Incubus, Powerman 5000, Hed PE, Snot, Far, and Static-X.

In 1998, Papa Roach released an EP titled &quot;5 Tracks Deep&quot;, which sold more than 1,000 copies within its first month of release. In 1999, the band produced another EP, their final independent release, titled &quot;Let &#x27;Em Know&quot;. Its success attracted the attention of Warner Music Group, which, as part of a development deal, provided a modest amount of funding for the production of a five-track promotional demo CD. The band sought out influential rock producer Jay Baumgardner to produce the record. In an interview with HitQuarters, Baumgardner stated, &quot;At first, I wasn&#x27;t really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club – I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart – and that&#x27;s when I realized that they definitely had potential.&quot;

Warner Bros. was unimpressed with the demo and chose not to sign the group. The unreleased disc included the tracks &quot;Infest,&quot; &quot;Last Resort,&quot; &quot;Broken Home,&quot; &quot;Dead Cell,&quot; and &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;.

Shortly thereafter, DreamWorks Records offered the band a recording contract.

===Mainstream success, &quot;Infest, Lovehatetragedy&quot; and &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot; (2000–2005)===
After signing with DreamWorks Records in October 1999, Papa Roach promptly entered the studio to record their major-label debut album, titled &quot;Infest&quot;. The album featured songs from their earlier independent releases, including &quot;Infest,&quot; &quot;Last Resort,&quot; &quot;Broken Home,&quot; and &quot;Dead Cell&quot; from the Warner Bros. demo CD; &quot;Revenge In Japanese&quot; as &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Thrown Away&quot; from their &quot;5 Tracks Deep&quot; EP; and &quot;Legacy,&quot; &quot;Binge,&quot; &quot;Snakes,&quot; and a softer version of the originally heavier &quot;Tightrope&quot; from the &quot;Let &#x27;Em Know&quot; EP. These tracks were re-recorded, along with three additional newly written songs: &quot;Obsession&quot; (later known as &quot;Between Angels and Insects&quot;), &quot;Blood Brothers,&quot; and &quot;Never Enough.&quot; &quot;Infest&quot; was released on April 25, 2000, and sold 30,001 copies in its first week.

With the release of their second album and the recording of the music video for &quot;Last Resort,&quot; Papa Roach embarked on the Vans Warped Tour and several other major tours, including the Anger Management Tour alongside Limp Bizkit and rap acts such as Eminem, Xzibit, D12, Ludacris, and X-Ecutioners. In 2000, they launched their headlining &quot;Master Bay&quot; tour, supported by Linkin Park and Hed PE. The band received a nomination for &quot;Best New Artist in a Video&quot; at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards for &quot;Last Resort.&quot;

In late 2000, the band toured the United Kingdom, demonstrating the rapid expansion of their global popularity. In 2001, they participated in Ozzfest, where they performed on the prestigious main stage during both the United States and United Kingdom tours. The song &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; was also featured in the popular video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;.

After touring worldwide, the band returned to the studio to record their third album, initially titled &quot;Born to Rock&quot;, but later renamed &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot;. The album was released in the United States on June 18, 2002. Although it did not outsell &quot;Infest&quot;, it achieved higher chart positions in both the United States and United Kingdom album charts. The album has sold over 500,000 copies and has been certified gold. The album featured a greater emphasis on singing rather than rapping, while the band retained their nu metal sound. It produced two singles: &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot; and &quot;Time and Time Again&quot;, both of which included elements of rapping along with the rap metal sound characteristic of &quot;Infest&quot;. The music video for &quot;Time and Time Again&quot; was featured in a Pepsi Blue commercial. That same year, the band embarked on a tour to support &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot;, which included performances on the second Anger Management Tour. This tour was co-headlined by Eminem and Papa Roach, alongside Ludacris, Xzibit, X-Ecutioners, and Bionic Jive. 
In late 2003, Papa Roach wrote and recorded their third album, initially titled &quot;Dancing In the Ashes&quot;, which was released as &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;. The band collaborated with well-known producer Howard Benson. After completing the album, the band filmed a music video for the title track, &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;, and went on a brief summer club tour to prepare for the subsequent tours. The album marked a departure for the band, as it was their first album not to incorporate the nu metal style of their previous works. Additionally, it was the band&#x27;s first album that did not feature rapping. &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot; outsold &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot;, primarily due to the success of the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Scars&quot;. To date, the album has sold over one million copies and has been certified Platinum. On November 9, 2004, the band released their fifth EP, &quot;Rolling Stone Original&quot;, an EP that was only available digitally. On November 22, 2005, they released their first live album, &quot;Papa Roach: Live &amp; Murderous in Chicago&quot;.

In 2005, the band spent a significant amount of time on tour, which included a full United States and European tour alongside bands such as Dead Poetic, Trust Company, Chronic Future, Skindred, 311, and Unwritten Law.

===&quot;The Paramour Sessions&quot; and Buckner&#x27;s departure (2006–2008)===

On September 12, 2006, Papa Roach released their fourth album, &quot;The Paramour Sessions&quot;. The band named the album after the recording location, the Paramour Mansion. The idea for an album recorded in a mansion emerged while the band was working on &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;. &quot;...To Be Loved&quot; was the first single released from the album and served as the official theme song for &quot;WWE Raw&quot; from 2006 to 2009. The album debuted at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 chart.

The band began touring in support of the album in August 2006, starting with an American tour followed by a European leg. In October 2006, Papa Roach toured with Guns N&#x27; Roses during their Chinese Democracy tour. They also served as the special guest band during the Zippo Hot Tour, alongside Hed PE and Stealing December.

On October 10, 2006, a String Quartet tribute album titled &quot;Perfect Murder: Strung Out on Papa Roach&quot; was released by Vitamin Records.

The band initially planned to release a compilation of acoustic recordings of their songs, including &quot;Forever,&quot; &quot;Scars,&quot; and &quot;Not Coming Home,&quot; which was recorded for KROQ-FM&#x27;s charity Christmas album, &quot;Kevin and Bean&#x27;s Super Christmas&quot;. However, the acoustic compilation was later shelved. In an interview with Billboard, Shaddix expressed his belief that fans were not yet ready for an acoustic direction from the band.

On April 25, 2007, it was announced that drummer Dave Buckner would be sitting out the band&#x27;s touring schedule due to personal matters, with expectations for him to rejoin the group shortly thereafter. Shaddix later confirmed in an interview with Launch Radio Networks that Dave had entered rehab to &quot;go clean his act up &#x27;cause he was out of his mind.&quot; Unwritten Law drummer Tony Palermo filled in on drums.

In the summer of 2007, the band went on the Bad Boys of Rock tour, supporting Hinder. During this tour, frontman Shaddix and Hinder lead singer Austin Winkler developed a strong friendship, leading to the band touring with Hinder on multiple occasions in subsequent years. It was revealed in 2015 that Shaddix and Austin wrote and recorded a song together for part of Winkler&#x27;s solo project, although both expressed uncertainty about whether the song would ever be released.

In 2008, it was announced that the band would officially part ways with drummer Dave Buckner. It was also revealed that Buckner had sued the band, claiming he wasn&#x27;t &quot;receiving his fair share of the group&#x27;s earnings.&quot;

=== &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and Tours (2008–2010) ===

In an interview in February 2008 with 99.7 The Blitz, Shaddix stated that the band was working on their next album, initially titled &quot;Days of War, Nights of Love&quot;. However, the album was later renamed to &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; to commemorate the band&#x27;s tenth anniversary of signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999 and to reflect the various changes the band had experienced during that time.

On April 15, Papa Roach announced they would be touring as part of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Crüe Fest&quot;, alongside Buckcherry, , and Trapt. The tour commenced on July 1 in West Palm Beach, Florida. The release date for the album was confirmed as August 26 during &quot;Crüe Fest&quot;.

Later in the year, the band also toured with Seether, Staind, and Red. During this tour, the release date for &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was changed to March 24, 2009.

On October 26, Papa Roach released the music video for the song &quot;Hollywood Whore&quot;, which was also released as an EP in Canada and as a digital single on October 28. The album&#x27;s first official single, &quot;Lifeline&quot;, was made available on the band&#x27;s MySpace profile on January 9, 2009. Additionally, the band toured with Buckcherry, Avenged Sevenfold, and Burn Halo in early 2009. The &quot;Crüe Fest&quot; DVD was released on March 24, coinciding with the release of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. The second single, &quot;I Almost Told You That I Loved You&quot;, was released on June 1. On June 23, they released their ninth EP, &quot;Naked and Fearless: Acoustic EP&quot;, which became available through the Zune Marketplace, iTunes, and Rhapsody.

&quot;Metamorphosis&quot; reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 8, marking the band&#x27;s first top ten album since 2002.

Papa Roach toured with Nickelback on their Dark Horse Tour, performing at Live Nation outdoor amphitheaters alongside Hinder and Saving Abel during the summer, as well as with Breaking Benjamin.

&quot;Lifeline&quot; was nominated for Fuse TV&#x27;s Best Video of 2009 contest, surpassing Metallica&#x27;s &quot;All Nightmare Long&quot;, Daughtry&#x27;s &quot;No Surprise&quot;, Shinedown&#x27;s &quot;Sound of Madness&quot;, and Paramore&#x27;s &quot;Ignorance&quot;. Ultimately, it finished 2nd to Britney Spears for her song &quot;Circus&quot; in the final round.

=== &quot;Time for Annihilation&quot; (2010–2012) ===

On January 8, 2010, Shaddix announced on Papa Roach&#x27;s official Twitter account that the band was about to begin working on new material. On February 8, 2010, Jerry Horton mentioned that he was in the studio beginning to write.

On February 23, 2010, Jerry Horton officially announced that the band would be releasing a new album, which was recorded during the last leg of their 2009 co-headlining tour with Shinedown in Binghamton, New York.

In April, the band performed two new songs: &quot;Burn&quot; at the Chili Cook Off in Richmond, Virginia on April 17, 2010, and &quot;Kick In the Teeth&quot; on April 30, 2010. In May, Jerry Horton stated in an interview that the album would be titled &quot;Time for Annihilation&quot; and would feature nine live tracks alongside five new songs, making it a combined live album and EP. He also mentioned that the first single would be &quot;Kick In the Teeth&quot; and that the band had switched labels to Eleven Seven Music. Later, Shaddix added that the album would be released on August 31. &quot;Kick In the Teeth&quot; was released as a single on June 22, 2010.

On June 29, 2010, the band&#x27;s former label, Geffen Records, released a greatest hits compilation titled &quot;...To Be Loved: The Best of Papa Roach&quot;, featuring the band&#x27;s biggest hits. However, the band advised fans against purchasing it, stating that they were not profiting from the album&#x27;s sales and that the label had released it against their wishes. The masters and/or copyrights of Papa Roach&#x27;s music are represented by Downtown Music Publishing. Although the band no longer owns the rights to their songs, they continue to perform them live.

&quot;Time for Annihilation&quot; was released on August 31, 2010. The band announced that the next singles from the album would be &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;No Matter What.&quot; They also expressed interest in releasing another live DVD but wanted to wait until they had a headlining show in Europe.

In October 2010, Papa Roach kicked off the &quot;Monsters of Annihilation&quot; tour with Skillet. From November 15, 2010, to December 13, 2010, the band toured with Disturbed, Buckcherry, and Halestorm on the Taste of Chaos tour. From March 1 to March 18, 2011, Papa Roach co-headlined the Canada leg of the Jägermeister Music Tour with Buckcherry, featuring special guests My Darkest Days and Bleeker Ridge.

In an interview, guitarist Jerry Horton mentioned that the band was planning to release a new album in 2012, indicating that Papa Roach would explore &quot;electronic sounds&quot; for this upcoming release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papa Roach : Interview 2010 / 2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate interview with Upvenue, bassist Tobin Esperance commented on &quot;Time for Annihilation,&quot; stating, &quot;We put out five major label, full-length records, and we were transitioning from a major label to going independent. We wanted to do something different [...] we&#x27;d always talked about doing a live record, and it turned into &#x27;let&#x27;s add a couple of bonus songs&#x27; [...] and now it&#x27;s half live, half new songs and it&#x27;s kind of the past and present of Papa Roach. I think it&#x27;s a good representation and a good reminder of what this band&#x27;s about, [...] and it gives you a look at where our sound can go.&quot;

Starting April 25, 2011, Papa Roach headlined the Raid The Nation tour, with the first leg featuring Finger Eleven. The second leg featured Escape the Fate, with both legs of the tour also including special guests Pop Evil. On June 23 and 25, the band co-headlined the Sonisphere Festival alongside Linkin Park.

In July 2011, Papa Roach performed two intimate shows in London and Sheffield with the band Yashin. They also co-headlined the Rock Allegiance Tour from August 24 to September 25, 2011, alongside Buckcherry. The tour also featured performances by Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Red, Crossfade, and Drive A.

=== &quot;The Connection&quot; (2012–2013) ===
Papa Roach entered the studio in November 2011 to begin work on their next album, aiming for a mid-2012 release. While in the studio, the band released the single &quot;Even If I Could,&quot; which was featured on the &quot;Avengers&quot; soundtrack.

On June 15, 2012, the band announced during a live chat with fans on YouTube that their next album would be released on October 2. The album was subsequently titled &quot;The Connection.&quot;

Papa Roach began touring in 2012 with co-headlining dates alongside Shinedown, supported by acts such as Adelitas Way and In This Moment. Following the brief co-headlining tour, Papa Roach embarked on a short headlining tour, featuring bands like In This Moment, Art of Dying, and Mindset Evolution. Additionally, Papa Roach participated on the main stage of the 2012 Uproar Festival, performing alongside Shinedown, Godsmack, Staind, and Adelitas Way.

The band released their first music video for the album on August 30, 2012. The concept for the &quot;Still Swingin&#x27;&quot; video originated from Jacoby&#x27;s eight-year-old son.

On September 8, 2012, Papa Roach announced dates for a European tour that would include performances in Belarus, Russia, Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK. They performed two co-headlining dates with Stone Sour in London on December 10 and 11, part of Stone Sour&#x27;s UK tour. Following these shows, they toured the United States with Stone Sour, starting on January 20, 2013, and performed on the main stage at the 2013 Download Festival at Donington Park, UK, on Friday, June 14. In September, the band was joined by original drummer Dave Buckner for a one-off performance of &quot;Last Resort.&quot; In October 2013, the band performed across Canada and the U.S. in support of &quot;The Connection&quot;, with Pop Evil and Age of Days also on the bill.

===&quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; (2014–2016)===
 
On February 3, 2014, the band announced they would be entering the studio to record a new album. On February 18, 2014, Jerry Horton tweeted that the first single was expected to be released &quot;somewhere around July.&quot; They held a live studio chat on YouTube on February 25, 2014. During the chat, they mentioned that they had already written four songs and revealed the titles of three tracks: &quot;Just as Broken as Me,&quot; &quot;Gravity,&quot; and &quot;War Over Me.&quot;

On April 24, 2014, in an interview with Loudwire, Jacoby Shaddix disclosed additional song titles from the upcoming album, including &quot;Never Have to Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Face Everything and Rise.&quot;

On July 10, 2014, it was announced that the band would release their new album, titled &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, in early 2015. On October 9, 2014, it was confirmed that the new album would be released on January 27, 2015, via Eleven Seven Music. In an interview, bassist Tobin Esperance admitted that the new release was heavier than previous albums and described how &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; marked the first time they allowed other artists to feature on their records.

On May 19, 2015, the band announced a co-headlining North American tour with longtime friends Five Finger Death Punch. They will be joined by In This Moment as special guests, with support from From Ashes to New for the tour.

===&quot;Crooked Teeth&quot; (2016–2018)===

On January 26, 2016, Papa Roach announced that they would begin writing their new album the following week. In July, they performed live at the Alternative Press Music Awards. In an interview, they stated that the new record would be released in early 2017, with the first single anticipated to drop later that year. The recording of the album was supported through the crowdfunding service PledgeMusic.

On November 1, 2016, &quot;Crooked Teeth&quot; became the first song released from the upcoming record. The first official single, titled &quot;Help&quot;, was released on February 17, 2017. On March 24, 2017, the band announced that their new album, &quot;Crooked Teeth&quot;, would be released on May 19, 2017. A second single, &quot;American Dreams&quot;, was released in April 2017, followed by a third single, &quot;Born for Greatness&quot;, released towards the end of the year. &quot;Born for Greatness&quot; was selected as the official main theme for WWE Raw in February 2018, replacing &quot;Enemies&quot; by Shinedown. Both &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Born for Greatness&quot; reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Charts, marking the first time the band had two songs from a single album achieve this feat.

===&quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; (2018–2020)===
In October 2017, the band revealed they had already written six songs for the follow-up to &quot;Crooked Teeth&quot;, with plans to begin recording the album in June 2018. On October 5, 2018, Papa Roach released two singles, &quot;Renegade Music&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot;, with the latter accompanied by a music video featuring frontman and vocalist Jacoby Shaddix as news reporter Larry Dickman. Subsequently, it was leaked that the new album would be titled &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot;, which was released on January 19, 2019. An interview with Papa Roach on November 9 confirmed this information. On November 16, 2018, the band released the new song &quot;Not the Only One&quot;. A third single, &quot;Come Around&quot;, was released in September 2019. In November 2020, the fourth single, &quot;The Ending&quot;, was released.

On December 25, 2020, the band released a compilation titled &quot;20/20&quot;, which included the &quot;Infest&quot; studio recordings they had previously uploaded to YouTube, as well as re-recordings of &quot;Tightrope,&quot; &quot;Last Resort,&quot; &quot;Scars,&quot; &quot;Getting Away with Murder,&quot; and &quot;Between Angels and Insects.&quot; On March 19, 2021, the band released their second greatest hits compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 2: The Better Noise Years&quot;.

On June 14, 2022, the band released the sixth single, &quot;No Apologies,&quot; accompanied by a music video.

=== Twelfth Studio Album (2025–present) ===
On January 22, 2025, the band released &quot;Even If It Kills Me&quot; as the lead single from their upcoming untitled twelfth studio album. It was released on the same day in as the band kicked off their European Tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Infest&quot; in Berlin, Germany, that is scheduled to conclude in Liverpool, England on February 9 at the M&amp;S Bank Arena. &quot;Even If It Kills Me&quot; was used at WWE&#x27;s &quot;Royal Rumble&quot; event as the theme song for Cody Rhodes vs Kevin Owens&#x27;s ladder match promo package.

== Musical style, influences, and legacy ==
Papa Roach has been described as alternative rock, nu metal, alternative metal, rap metal, hard rock, rap rock, punk rock, pop rock, and rapcore. The band also incorporates elements of pop, electronic, and hip hop. 

The band began as a hardcore punk group, and evolved towards nu metal and rap metal styles on their early independent releases, and on their first two major label albums, &quot;Infest&quot; and &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot;. Before Papa Roach released their major label albums, Jacoby Shaddix&#x27;s singing style was compared to Chino Moreno and Lynn Strait of Snot. Additionally, with their 2009 album, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, the band felt their music was undergoing a transformation to &quot;stuff that&#x27;s...harder and faster.&quot; AllMusic has compared the band&#x27;s recent work to 1980s glam metal, while Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that &quot;at the close of the 2000s, the quartet has shed the rap and the angst, ditching all the alt-metal accoutrements to become a knowing update of an &#x27;80s Sunset Strip sleaze rock outfit.&quot; With the release of &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, both MetalSucks and Metal Injection noted that the band had incorporated some djent influences.

In 2004, frontman Jacoby Shaddix said the following in an interview with the Dallas Music Guide regarding the band no longer using rapping in their music: &quot;...the rapping&#x27;s gone! I don&#x27;t feel like rapping. I&#x27;m just over that...I just want to be a rocker. It&#x27;s what I wanted to be when I was a kid&quot;. Shaddix has added this remark in another interview: &quot;We&#x27;re a band that tries to walk that line between metal, hardcore, punk rock and pop music, and we do our best at trying to make it all cool&quot;.

Prior to the release of &quot;The Connection&quot;, guitarist Jerry Horton said in an interview by VerdamMnis Magazine that &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a natural thing for us, we&#x27;ve always been changing throughout the years. Of course, there are some things that stay the same in our sound but we do like to try new things to sort of stretch out a little bit our basis and therefore make it more interesting&quot;. He also said that the band was going to explore &quot;electronic sounds for the next record&quot;.

The band&#x27;s influences include Faith No More, Social Distortion, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Wu-Tang Clan, Fugees, Refused, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Jacoby Shaddix cites Faith No More&#x27;s Mike Patton and Social Distortion&#x27;s Mike Ness as significant influences, stating, &quot;The way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton, but I appreciate the storytelling that Mike Ness does. I kind of fused those two influences together at an early age, and it inspired me to become my own thing.&quot;

Initially, Papa Roach&#x27;s most significant influence was the experimental band Mr. Bungle, fronted by Mike Patton of Faith No More. This influence is evident in the adventurous nature of their 1994 debut release, &quot;Potatoes for Christmas&quot;.

In a 2021 interview, Jacoby Shaddix reflected on the band&#x27;s longstanding association with the nu metal genre, stating, &quot;I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that&#x27;s dope, but we&#x27;ve been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time.&quot;

Papa Roach is regarded as one of the bands that helped define the nu metal sound. Alternative Press stated: &quot;Despite distancing themselves from their distinctive sound in recent years, Papa Roach&#x27;s early output shaped the aspect of nü metal that the mainstream embraced with open arms—riff-laden, radio-friendly (at least, after a few bleeps) singles with dark, earworm lyrics designed to upset parents. Jacoby Shaddix&#x27;s in-your-face tones introduced many teenagers to their nü-metal awakening, supported by completely singable and seductive guitar lines that made this outfit so instrumental in the genre. So much so that a feature from Shaddix serves as a seal of approval for any album.&quot;

Regarding the band&#x27;s album &quot;Infest,&quot; Kerrang! magazine remarked: &quot;Straining vocal cords and detonating dancefloors with &#x27;Last Resort,&#x27; tugging the heartstrings with &#x27;Broken Home,&#x27; and embedding themselves under our skin with &#x27;Between Angels And Insects,&#x27; Jacoby Shaddix&#x27;s Californian group didn&#x27;t just deliver an overload of angst—they unleashed every ounce of emotion through arguably the catchiest songwriting nu metal would ever see. Adolescence never truly ends, and even now, these are absolutely essential sounds.&quot;

<text>Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple (Chinese: 释迦牟尼菩提迦耶寺) is a Buddhist monastery in Singapore. The temple was originally set up by Venerable Vutthisara of Thailand. The present premises are located at Race Course Road in Singapore.

==History==
The Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple was founded in 1927 by a Thai monk known as Ven Vutthisara. The temple grew in popularity and, in 1930, Ven Vutthisasara built the present temple building with a donation from Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par. 

==Influences==

There are strong Thai influences in the architecture and decor.

==Buddha Statue==
The Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple is one of the most prominent and widely visited Buddhist temples in Singapore, often referred to as the &quot;Temple of 1,000 Lights&quot;. It features a 15-meter high statue of a seated Buddha, which weighs nearly 300 tons, as well as many smaller Buddha images and murals depicting the life of Gautama Buddha. The large central statue is surrounded by a stylized aura made of numerous light bulbs— often lit with a donation towards the temple(approach the friendly staff to request)—from which the temple derives its nickname. In a small room beneath the altar is an image of a reclining Buddha, Buddha towards the end of his life, under a Yellow Saraka Tree.

On Vesak Day, the annual holiday celebrating the birth and enlightenment of Lord Buddha, devotees donate money to the temple and in exchange are allowed to place gold leaf onto a small statue of the Buddha. As the day wears on, the Buddha statue is almost entirely covered in a fresh layer of gold leaves.

The temple is open between 8.00 am and 4.30 pm daily. Admission is free.

<doc id="922784" wikidata="Q7718830" url="?curid=922784" title="The Blue Room (play)">
<text>The Blue Room is a 1998 play by David Hare, adapted from the 1897 play &quot;Der Reigen&quot; written by Arthur Schnitzler (1862–1931), and more usually known by the French translation &quot;La Ronde&quot;.

==Schnitzler&#x27;s play==

Schnitzler completed the play in 1900, but did not intend it to be performed, even calling the series of scenes &#x27;unprintable&#x27;, he intended them to be read by friends. The play was too sexually explicit to be performed at the time. Subsequently, it was read and then performed in private. Its first public performance in 1921, under the now accepted title &quot;Reigen&quot;, was closed down by the Vienna police – Schnitzler was prosecuted for obscenity.

&quot;Reigen&quot; was meant as a dramatic exposé of the decadence of the Austrian society. Schnitzler, being a doctor approached the decadence of society from a medical point of view, studying the journey of syphilis through all classes of society. The title &quot;Reigen&quot; would be best translated as &#x27;round-dance&#x27; or &#x27;roundelay&#x27;. This refers to the daisy chain of sexual encounters, which also determines the format of the play. It is divided into ten scenes and each holds two characters (always male and female) and their sexual encounter. The following scene contains one character from the previous scene and a new one. A has sex with B, B has sex with C, and so on; until in the tenth scene the circle closes with J having sex with A.

==Hare&#x27;s adaptation==
Hare&#x27;s adaptation, called &quot;The Blue Room&quot;, transfers the action from Vienna to &#x27;one of the great cities of the world, in the present day&#x27;. The characters change accordingly, the soldier becomes a cab driver, the parlour maid becomes an &quot;au pair&quot;, etc...

Hare&#x27;s major difference from the original piece is the idea of performing it as a two-person show. Hare states that he was not the first person to do so. In 1981 when the theatrical rights fell temporarily out of copyright several stage versions were crafted and performed.
Otherwise, Hare&#x27;s adaptation is not far from the original. 
Syphilis or any other sexually transmitted disease is never explicitly mentioned in either Schnitzler&#x27;s original or Hare&#x27;s adaptation. Scene VI contains the only reference to this when the politician is concerned about &#x27;hygiene&#x27; having just slept with the model.

Sam Mendes had asked Hare to adapt Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;Reigen&quot;. The 1950 movie &quot;La Ronde&quot; by Max Ophüls was also based on &quot;Reigen&quot; and has influenced many stage adaptations, including &quot;The Blue Room&quot;.

===The characters===
*The Girl (Irene) - Scene I &amp; X
*The Cab Driver (Fred) - Scene I &amp; II
*The Au Pair (Marie) - Scene II &amp; III
*The Student (Anton) - Scene III &amp; IV
*The Married Woman (Emma) - Scene IV &amp; V
*The Politician (Charles) - Scene V &amp; VI
*The Model (Kelly) - Scene VI &amp; VII
*The Playwright (Robert) - Scene VII &amp; VIII
*The Actress - Scene VIII &amp; IX
*The Aristocrat (Malcolm) - Scene IX &amp; X

===Performances===
Hare&#x27;s adaptation was first performed at the Donmar Warehouse, London, on 10 September 1998 with Nicole Kidman and Iain Glen in lead roles. It was directed by Sam Mendes, designed by Mark Thompson, and lit by Hugh Vanstone, with music by Paddy Cunneen. London critic Charles Spencer&#x27;s review for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; concluded with the now iconic phrase, &quot;It&#x27;s pure theatrical Viagra.&quot; The production was a commercial success and on 13 December of that year moved to the Cort Theatre on Broadway, New York (with the same cast), but received mixed reviews. Kidman&#x27;s brief nude appearance, a short flash of her buttocks on a semi-dark stage, caused a hullabaloo and was attributed to brisk ticket sales. Glen&#x27;s full frontal nudity while cartwheeling attracted far less attention. Several reviewers commented on the best seats to view Kidman&#x27;s backside.

Hare&#x27;s play was also performed to critical acclaim in Australia in 2002 with Sigrid Thornton and Marcus Graham in the two lead roles, and directed by Simon Phillips. The Sydney performances took place at the Theatre Royal after a run in Melbourne. The nude scenes and Thornton&#x27;s &quot;sexy&quot; body were also noted.

The independent film Cubes was structurally inspired by &quot;The Blue Room&quot;. Screenwriter Mark Zdancewicz transplanted the play&#x27;s daisy chain structure into the modern office environment. The film, directed by Jason Sherry, follows a series of rotating cubicle partners over the course of a year.

<text>Stephan Friedrich Ladislaus Endlicher, also known as Endlicher István László (24 June 1804 – 28 March 1849), was an Austrian botanist, numismatist and Sinologist. He was a director of the Botanical Garden of Vienna.

==Biography==
Endlicher studied theology and received minor orders. In 1828 he was appointed to the Austrian National Library to reorganize its manuscript collection. Concurrently he studied natural history, in particular botany, and East-Asian languages.

In 1836, Endlicher was appointed keeper of the court cabinet of natural history, and in 1840 he became professor at the University of Vienna and director of its Botanical Garden. He wrote a comprehensive description of the plant kingdom according to a natural system, at the time its most comprehensive description. As proposed by Endlicher, it contained images with text. It was published together with the reissue of Franz Unger&#x27;s &quot;Grundzüge der Botanik&quot; (Fundamentals of Botany).

Endlicher was fundamental in establishing the Imperial Academy of Science (), but when contrary to his expectations the Baron Joseph Hammer von Purgstall was elected its president in his stead, he resigned. He presented his library and herbaria to the state, and passed several hours every week for 10 years in the society of the Emperor Ferdinand, but he received no other reward than the title of councillor ().

In 1842, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

As a known liberal, Endlicher was asked to act as mediator during the revolution of 1848, but eventually was forced to leave Vienna for a time. In 1848 he also became a member of the Frankfurt Parliament and the assembly at Kremsier (Kroměříž).

==Works==
Endlicher made valuable contributions to the science of old German and classic literature, and pointed out new sources of Hungarian history, publishing &quot;Fragmenta Theotisca Versionis antiquissimae Evangelii Matthaei&quot; (edited with Hoffmann von Fallersleben, 1834), an edition of two poems of Priscian (1828), and &quot;Anonymi Belæ Regis Notarii de Gestis Hungarorum Liber&quot; (1827). His linguistic publications comprise &quot;Analecta Grammatica&quot; (with Eichenfeld, 1836), and &quot;Anfangsgründe der chinesischen Grammatik&quot; (Foundations of Chinese grammar; 1845).

His &quot;Verzeichniss der japanesischen und chinesischen Münzen des kaiserlichen Münz- und Antikencabinets&quot; (Catalog of Japanese and Chinese coins in the imperial coin and antique collections; 1837) and &quot;Atlas von China nach der Aufnahme der Jesuitenmissionäre&quot; (Atlas of China after the arrival of the Jesuit missionaries; 1843) are finely executed, and deserve mention as specimens of his great liberality.

He wrote several works in conjunction with other scholars, and many of his minor writings are scattered among the periodicals of his time, especially in the &quot;Annalen des Wiener Museums&quot;.

===Botany===
The majority and the most valuable of his works are on botany. Foremost among them are his: &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; (1831–1841), in which he lays down a new system of classification; &quot;Grundzüge einer neuen Theorie der Pflanzenerzeugung&quot; (Foundations of a new theory of plant breeding; 1838); and &quot;Die Medicinalpflanzen der österreichischen Pharmakopöe&quot; (Medicinal plants in the Austrian pharmacopoeia; 1842).

His other principal botanical works are: &quot;Ceratotheca&quot; (1822), &quot;Flora Posoniensis&quot; (1830), &quot;Diesingia&quot; (1832), &quot;Atacta Botanica&quot; (1833), &quot;Iconographia Generum Plantarum&quot; (1838), &quot;Enchiridion Botanikum&quot; (1841) and &quot;Synopsis Coniferarum&quot; (1847).

Endlicher established the botanical journal &quot;Annalen des Wiener Museums der Naturgeschichte&quot; (1835 and on). He began the work &quot;Flora Brasiliensis&quot; with Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. He also published early works on the flora of Australia, including the plants collected by Carl von Hugel and Ferdinand Bauer.

Endlicher described many new plant genera, including the genus &quot;Sequoia&quot;, and also its only extant species &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; (California coast redwood). Although Endlicher never offered an explanation for the name, later writers speculated that he must have been inspired by the achievements of the American Cherokee Indian linguist Sequoyah. John Davis credited Endlicher with naming the new species of Sierra redwood &quot;Sequoyah gigantea&quot; in 1847, the present day &quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot; (California giant redwood), to honor Sequoyah&#x27;s invention of the Cherokee syllabary. Recent scholarship supports this hypothesis; Endlicher appears to have combined the Latin &quot;sequi&quot; (meaning &quot;to follow&quot;) with his admiration of Sequoyah and coined &quot;Sequoia&quot; because the number of seeds per cone in the newly classified genus fell in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder. .

==Tribute==
The genus &quot;Endlicheria&quot; of the family Lauraceae and the genus &quot;Endlichera&quot; of the family Rubiaceae (now synonym of &quot;Emmeorhiza&quot;) were named in his honour. Both plant genera occur in Tropical America.

The African fish &quot;Polypterus endlicherii&quot; was named in honor of Endlicher, who apparently discovered the species in the fish collection at the Naturhistorisches Museum (Vienna).

<doc id="922791" wikidata="Q13373598" url="?curid=922791" title="Gods and Generals (novel)">
<text>Gods and Generals is a novel which serves as a prequel to Michael Shaara&#x27;s 1974 Pulitzer Prize–winning work about the Battle of Gettysburg, &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. Written by Jeffrey Shaara after his father Michael&#x27;s death in 1988, the novel relates events from 1858 through 1863, during the American Civil War, ending just as the two armies march toward Gettysburg. Shaara also wrote &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot;, published in 2000, which follows the events presented in &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; was made into a film directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and starring Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels. The film shares most of its cast with &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, the film adaptation of &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;.

==Plot==
Copying his father&#x27;s approach of focusing on the most important officers of the two armies (General Robert E. Lee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, Lt. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, and Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Chamberlain), Shaara depicted the emotional drama of soldiers fighting old friends while accurately detailing historical details including troop movements, strategies, and tactical combat situations. General Hancock, for instance, spends much of the novel dreading the day he will have to fire on his friend in the Confederate Army, Lewis &quot;Lo&quot; Armistead. The novel also deals with General Lee&#x27;s disillusionment with the Confederate bureaucracy and General Jackson&#x27;s religious fervor.

In addition to covering events leading up to the war, the book includes the First Battle of Bull Run, covered only from the perspective of Robert E. Lee, who was in Richmond at the time and thus not at the battle. Other battles described in the novel are Williamsburg, Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The film version provides only cursory coverage of immediate pre-war events, focusing primarily on Jackson and the secession of Virginia, and omits Antietam (included in the Director&#x27;s Cut) along with Williamsburg and Second Bull Run. It spends a considerable amount of time on First Bull Run, which played only a minor role in the book.

==Awards==
In 1997, it received the W. Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction from the American Library Association.

==Other media==
&quot;Gods and Generals&quot; is also the title of the second album recorded by Swedish power metal band Civil War. All three of this band&#x27;s albums share titles with each book in this trilogy: &quot;The Killer Angels, Gods and Generals, The Last Full Measure&quot;.

<text>Andrey Yefimovich Martynov (Андрей Ефимович Мартынов; 1768–1826) was a painter and engraver from the Russian Empire. Member of the Imperial Academy of Arts.

==Biography==
Born in St. Petersburg to the family of a sergeant in the Preobrazhensky Guards regiment, Martynov graduated from the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1788. In St. Petersburg Martynov studied landscape painting under Semion Shchedrin. From 1788 to 1794 he studied in Italy and painted the landscapes of Rome and its surroundings. These works for art were highly appreciated, by Martynov’s return to St. Petersburg. He was awarded the title of Academician in 1795. He worked on commissions from the Imperial court, and he participated in the decorating of several royal palaces and became a councilor of the Academy in 1802.

He travelled throughout southern Russia from 1804, primarily creating idealized watercolour of rural towns and landscapes. The beauty of the area around Lake Baikal especially captivated him, “it is surrounded by the Sayan Mountains, whose endless chain and picture-like diversity bring to the traveller’s gaze the infectious grandeur of nature”. His works of art is comparable to the present pair in its idealised panoramic vision of nature, with its vast expanses of water and sky. Like View of Irkutsk, Martynov’s Irkutsk, focuses more on the surrounding landscape than the city itself. These very Classical compositions are entirely devoted to the celebration of the beauty of nature. In 1805 he was the official artist of the Russian embassy to China by Earl A. Golovkin.

Martynov moved gradually away from painting into the newer media of etching and lithography, which he is primarily known for, because of his lithographic techniques. His series of lithographs of the lands and peoples of Mongolia (entitled &quot;Views of Russia and Mongolia&quot; and &quot;Peoples Types of Russia and Mongolia&quot;) were greatly admired. A later set of lithographs, made while touring the Baltic regions (&quot;Views of the Baltic Countries&quot;), was similarly lauded in 1810.

Martynov died in Italy in 1826.

<text>The River Brent is a river in west and northwest London, England, and a tributary of the River Thames. in length, it rises in the Borough of Barnet and flows in a generally south-west direction before joining the Tideway stretch of the Thames at Brentford.

== Hydronymy and etymology ==
A letter from the Bishop of London in 705 suggesting a meeting at Breġuntford, now Brentford, is the earliest record of this place and probably therefore that of the river, suggesting that the name may be related to the Celtic *&quot;brigant-&quot; meaning &quot;high&quot; or &quot;elevated&quot;, perhaps linked to the goddess Brigantia.

==Topography, geology and evolution of the Brent catchment area==

(For the purposes of this section, the Brent catchment area is taken to include the catchment areas of all its tributaries.)

The catchment area varies in altitude from just over 150 metres above sea level at Bushey Heath, on its northern watershed, to barely 10 metres at the confluence of the Brent with the Thames at Brentford.

Broadly speaking, the catchment area can be divided into three topographical zones:

- a southern zone, lying south of a line from about Harlesden to Northolt, which is of low relief and which (apart from the hill at Hanger Lane) lies below an altitude of 40 metres;

- a basin-like north-western zone which is surrounded by areas of higher ground which rise fairly steeply to the west (Harrow on the Hill), north (Bushy Heath) and east (Mill Hill), and where several isolated hills such as Horsenden Hill, Barn Hill and Dollis Hill are located; and

- a north-eastern zone consisting of the relatively narrow and steep-sided valleys of the Dollis Brook, Folly Brook and Mutton Brook; and of the high ground which surrounds those valleys (at Hampstead Heath, Whetstone, Totteridge, Chipping Barnet, etc).

The oldest and most extensive geological formation in the Brent catchment area, as in much of the London Basin, is Eocene London Clay. This is mostly a stiff blue-brown clay, over 100 metres thick. In some higher parts of the area, a relatively thin, upper part of the London Clay formation, sandier in content and known as the Claygate Beds, is also found.

In some areas of relatively limited extent, such as on the higher parts of Harrow on the Hill, Hampstead and Highgate, the London Clay and Claygate Beds are overlain by sandy Eocene Bagshot Beds.

All these formations are overlain in several areas by much younger, Pleistocene formations, principally fluvial deposits and glacial deposits. The oldest Pleistocene deposit, Pebble Gravel, is found across the upper, northern margin of the catchment area, from Bushey Heath to Chipping Barnet. The most recent Pleistocene deposits include the post-Anglian river terrace deposits of the Thames and Brent rivers in Ealing and other southern parts of the catchment area. Glacial till is found in the north-eastern sector of the catchment area, around Finchley.

Current topography is largely the result of landform evolution during the Pleistocene epoch (that is, during the last two million years or so).

Although a tributary of the River Thames, the Brent is much younger in age. An Ancestral Thames is thought to have come into being over 60 million years ago, during the post-Cretaceous uplift of Britain (an uplift which was tilted to the south-east).
The Brent, as a southward-flowing, left-bank tributary of the Thames, was formed as a result of the Anglian glaciation, which occurred about 450,000 years ago.

===The area prior to the Anglian glaciation===
In the early twentieth century, it was suggested that the River Thames, after descending through Oxfordshire, entering the London Basin near the Goring Gap and running north-east from there, continued in that direction prior to the ice advance, past Watford and along the line of the Vale of St Albans. 
This hypothesis has since been confirmed by much subsequent research.

That &quot;proto-Thames&quot; river received tributaries from the south. At least one of those tributaries traversed what is today a dissected plateau which lies to the south-east of the Vale of St Albans. This plateau stretches from Bushey Heath to Northaw and beyond, and is capped over wide areas, at altitudes ranging from about 150 metres to 130 metres, by a fairly thin (average 3 metres) layer of sand and gravel known as Pebble Gravel (or, in places, Stanmore Gravel).

Although flint is the main component of this gravel, it has been known since the late nineteenth century that it also contains in places a notable quantity of chert derived from Lower Greensand Beds in the Weald. It was suggested early on that this &quot;pointed to the former existence of streams from that area&quot;.

S.W. Wooldridge later suggested that it was in fact &quot;a river of major dimensions&quot; (which) &quot;entered from the south&quot; that was responsible for transporting much of this chert to areas which are now north of the River Thames. It was clear from the broad course which Wooldridge plotted for this river that it was an ancestor of the River Mole (and/or River Wey).

In 1994, D.R. Bridgland proposed that Pebble Gravel (or Stanmore Gravel) which is located on Harrow Weald Common (near Bushey Heath) was deposited by an ancestral Mole-Wey, and that that river was a tributary of the River Thames at a time when the latter river was flowing to the north-west of the Vale of St Albans. That could have been nearly two million years ago. He also suggested that similar gravel, located further north-east near Northaw at a slightly lower altitude, was also deposited by an ancestral Mole-Wey, but at a later date (which could have been around 1.75 million years ago).

At those times, the topography of the country in what is today the Brent catchment area would have been very different from today&#x27;s topography, because the Pebble Gravel was laid down on a valley floor, whereas today it occupies the highest ground in the area. The relief has thus been inverted.

But, in 1979, P.L. Gibbard mapped younger deposits, known as Dollis Hill Gravel and named after one of the locations where this deposit is found, which were also laid down by an ancestral Mole-Wey river. (This river is also referred to in places as the &quot;proto-Mole-Wey&quot;.) 
These deposits are found at what is today the so-called Finchley Gap, and to the north-east and south-west of it. Dollis Hill Gravel is found, for example, south-west of the Gap at Hendon and Horsenden Hill, and north-east of the Gap over wide areas from Southgate to Goff&#x27;s Oak.

Today, the highest of those deposits rest at an altitude of around 100 metres (for example at Muswell Hill). So the proto-Mole-Wey valley around Finchley, in the sense of being an area of lower ground lying between higher ground on either side (for example, at Mill Hill and Hampstead Heath, both at altitudes of over 120 metres today), must have existed by the time those highest deposits of Dollis Hill Gravel were laid down. That could have been around one million years ago.

The proto-Mole-Wey river which laid down the Dollis Hill Gravel thus flowed along a line broadly similar to that of today&#x27;s River Brent, but in the opposite direction, from south-west to north-east. The gradient of the floor of that valley in the area now occupied by the Brent catchment was low - probably no more than 50 cm per kilometre.

====Tributaries of the proto-Mole-Wey river====
The number, and courses, of the tributary streams which flowed into the proto-Mole-Wey river prior to the Anglian glaciation, in the area currently covered by the Brent catchment area, are not known with any certainty. But it is known that, elsewhere, some tributaries of rivers which were themselves severely disrupted by that glaciation today still follow broadly the same lines as their pre-glaciation valleys. This is the case, for example, for certain tributaries of the upper River Lea, such as the Rivers Mimram and Stort.

So it seems reasonable to suggest that parts at least of the network of tributary streams which flowed into the proto-Mole-Wey river, in the area currently covered by the Brent catchment area, proved to be equally robust. Thus, it is possible that, although the proto-Mole-Wey river itself was completely replaced by the River Brent during the Anglian glaciation, and parts of those of its tributaries which came into contact with the ice front were diverted (as described below), other sections of today&#x27;s network of Brent tributaries broadly reflect parts of the pre-Anglian network of tributary streams which fed the proto-Mole-Wey. This could apply to, for example, the upper part of the Dollis Brook, the Folly Brook, the Silk Stream and the Wealdstone Brook.

In the case of the uppermost section of the Dollis Brook, which runs broadly west-east from Barnet Gate towards Barnet Playing Fields, it is possible that, immediately prior to the Anglian glaciation, that stream continued eastwards (where it now turns southwards, for reasons explained in the next section), at a today&#x27;s altitude of about 90 metres, and joined a precursor of the Pymmes Brook in the vicinity of East Barnet. That precursor brook may then have flowed south-eastwards to join the proto-Mole-Wey somewhere around New Southgate.

===The Anglian glaciation===
It has been known since the nineteenth century that an ice sheet once descended from the north of England as far as north London and left behind extensive spreads of till and other glacial deposits. This ice advance has since been identified as the Anglian glaciation. After reaching as far south as Ware, about 450,000 years ago, lobes of this ice sheet extended up two valleys, oriented south-west to north-east - that of the proto-Thames (which, by this time was flowing along the line of the Vale of St Albans, and where an ice lobe extended to Watford), and that of the proto-Mole-Wey (where the other lobe extended to Finchley).

In the early twentieth century it was concluded that the Thames must have been diverted to its more southerly course of today by the ice advance up the Vale of St Albans to Watford.

As noted above, the proto-Mole-Wey river was a tributary of the proto-Thames. It flowed northwards from the Weald, then passed through what is today the Brent catchment area (but in the opposite direction to the flow of today&#x27;s River Brent).

As an ice sheet lobe advanced up the proto-Thames valley towards Watford, the passage of the river was blocked, and its water backed up to form a lake in front of the advancing ice. That lake eventually extended as far up the proto-Thames valley as a point south of Gerrards Cross, where lacustrine deposits have been identified.

The water in that lake eventually rose to relatively low points on the interfluve with the proto-Mole-Wey catchment area to the south-east, where that water could overflow into that catchment area. Two such points were at Carpenders Park and Uxbridge.

Water overflowed into the proto-Mole-Wey catchment in a considerable volume and with considerable force (to the extent that, in the case of the overflow at Uxbridge, the Thames in due course established a completely new course through that route).

In the case of the overflow through the Carpenders Park gap (today followed by the West Coast Main (railway) Line between London Euston and Watford), the Thames overspill surged through Wealdstone and Kenton. The land it crossed would have been bare of vegetation and very susceptible to fluvial erosion. The powerful overflow quickly eroded areas of higher ground. This could have included a possible ridge of higher ground running from Stanmore to Colindale (separating ancestral valleys of the Wealdstone Brook and Silk Stream), similar to and parallel with the ridge that still exists and that runs from Barnet Gate to Mill Hill. The overflow thus carved out much of the London Clay basin which today forms the north-western section of the River Brent catchment area. In particular, it probably removed much of the Dollis Hill Gravel which must have been situated in this area prior to the Anglian glaciation.
At the same time, a lake formed in front of the ice lobe which was moving south-westwards up the proto-Mole-Wey valley towards Finchley, and which was blocking the flow of the proto-Mole-Wey river. The swirling waters of that lake also caused considerable erosion of the previous topography. But isolated islands, mostly capped by Dollis Hill Gravel, were left within the lake.

The Thames eventually established a diverted course from Uxbridge to Richmond, from where it continued, in a broadly eastwards direction, towards the North Sea. This caused the lake in the proto-Mole-Wey valley to be drained, thus leaving the former islands in the lake as isolated hills in what is now the London Clay basin of the north-western section of the River Brent catchment area.

====The birth of the river Brent====
As illustrated on a geological map of the area, it is striking that Dollis Brook, for the greater part of its length between Barnet Playing Fields and Henly&#x27;s Corner, follows a north-south line close to the western limit of glacial till left by the ice sheet lobe which extended to Finchley.

Similarly, Mutton Brook follows an east-west line which is close to the southern limit of glacial till left by the ice sheet lobe.

This is because, as the ice sheet lobe in the valley of the proto-Mole-Wey river moved up that valley, it would have blocked streams flowing down towards that river from higher ground to the west and south. In particular, it would have forced the eastward-flowing Dollis Brook to have turned to the south, alongside the western edge of the ice lobe (and likewise for Folly Brook). And it would have forced northward-flowing drainage coming down from Highgate and Hampstead to have turned to the west, alongside the southern edge of the ice lobe (thus forming Mutton Brook).

Fed by meltwater from the adjacent ice sheet, these streams would have cut down quickly along their new routes. And later, when the ice sheet retreated, a substantial thickness of till was left behind where the ice once sat. (For example, in the locality of the Finchley Gap, the ice left glacial deposits which today are up to 18 metres in thickness.) Consequently, after the ice retreated, the two streams continued along the same courses that they had been forced to follow by the ice lobe - between glacial till and the higher ground of Mill Hill, etc in the case of Dollis Brook, and between glacial till and Hampstead Heath, etc in the case of Mutton Brook.

At the time of the ice lobe, those two streams would at first have flowed into the pro-glacial lake in the proto-Mole-Wey valley which is referred to above.

But then the River Thames established its newly-diverted course. That course appears to have run along a line approximately from Uxbridge to Northolt Park, Perivale, Richmond and Streatham Hill. The newly-diverted Thames thus cut across the floor of the proto-Mole-Wey valley. And being a very powerful river, it would also have cut down below the level of that valley floor to some extent. Water from the Finchley pro-glacial lake would thus have flowed down into the Thames and would have been carried away by it. As mentioned earlier, the lake would thus have dried up.

A stream would then have cut back from the Thames, probably from around Hanger Lane. That stream probably cut back in a north-easterly direction along the line of the former proto-Mole-Wey valley bottom (the near-flat surface of which would by then have been covered by a certain amount of glaciofluvial material deposited by meltwater flowing from the front of the ice lobe). That stream, which would quickly have cut back to the ice front at Henly&#x27;s Corner, would have been the incipient River Brent. Dollis Brook and Mutton Brook would have there flowed into this new stream. And the new stream would have been joined on its right bank by former tributaries of the proto-Mole-Wey river, notably the Wealdstone Brook and the Silk Stream.

As the ice sheet melted, that incipient River Brent would have been heavily loaded with glaciofluvial material flowing from the melting ice, and from the till which the ice sheet was leaving behind. It appears that, at Hanger Lane, near its initial confluence with the Thames, the Brent was forced to deposit a large quantity of that material. In doing so it may also have been forced to move to its current course, slightly to the north, with its junction with the Thames thus moving to the west, in the vicinity of Greenford.

Thus, by end of the Anglian stage, the current drainage network in the Brent catchment area had broadly been established. But the rivers and streams in the network at that time would then have been flowing at a higher level, relative to their altitudes today. On average, this could have been around 20–30 metres higher.

===post-Anglian landscape evolution===
In the 400,000 years which followed the Anglian stage, rivers and streams incised themselves more deeply into the underlying strata. That erosion mostly took place in periods of &quot;high discharge, under cold climatic conditions&quot; when river flow was augmented and when vegetation was thin.

In particular, the River Thames, which, in the vicinity of Hanger Lane was at a today&#x27;s altitude of around 70 metres when it first established its diverted course, had probably cut down to about 60 metres by the end of the Anglian stage, and is now at an altitude of barely 10 metres at Kew.

In thus cutting down by about 50 metres since the Anglian stage, the Thames would thus have lowered the base level of rivers and streams in the Brent catchment area, and they too have cut down to a notable degree in places, even though they obviously had much less erosive power than the much-larger Thames. For example, the junction of Dollis Brook and Mutton Brook today is at an altitude of just under 50 metres. When the proto-Mole-Wey river was flowing through this locality prior to the Anglian glaciation, it was at an altitude of 68 metres.

And Dollis Brook is relatively steep-sided in certain sections - for example, around Woodside Park, where the ground falls from over 90 metres altitude on the Finchley High Road to the brook at barely 60 metres, in a distance of only about one kilometre. A sizable section of that slope would have been the result of fluvial incision since the Anglian stage.

During its post-Anglian incision, the Thames in this area moved in a southward direction. As it did so, it laid down river terrace deposits (mostly sand and gravel) of decreasing age and altitude. The Thames-Brent confluence also moved to the south, with the River Brent thus extending its course by over five kilometres, from Greenford to Hanwell, then to Brentford. As the Brent moved southwards, it cut down through the river terrace deposits which had been laid down by the Thames.

During the post-Anglian period, the River Brent itself left river terrace deposits in places. An older one is a Boyn Hill deposit just north of Brent Reservoir at an altitude of 60 metres. Younger ones include almost continual stretches of Taplow and Kempton Park deposits in the valley bottom and adjacent slopes downstream of Brent Reservoir.

Thin strips of alluvium, immediately adjacent to the River Brent, Wealdstone Brook, Silk Stream and Dollis Brook, have been deposited in very recent geological times. They extend throughout almost the whole length of those watercourses.

During the long, cold periods of the last 400,000 years, when there were an arctic climate and a lack of vegetation, &quot;periglacial solifluction has been the most potent agent of erosion in the district ... when snow melted in the spring, debris of frost-weathered material formed a slurry, which gradually flowed downhill&quot;. This process has caused a general lowering of the surface over much of the Brent catchment, particularly perhaps in the London Clay basin of the north-western sector of the catchment, such as in the Kenton area. It has also probably accentuated the isolation of the isolated hills in that sector, and led to a diminution in their size. This is illustrated in both senses by the current aspect of Horsenden Hill, whose minuscule Dollis Hill Gravel cap is nearly three kilomètres distant from its nearest neighbour at Wembley (Linden Avenue).

Wind erosion has also been a factor, especially, it seems, in fairly recent very cold periods (of the late Devensian). Wind-blown deposits form part of the &quot;brickearth&quot; (or &quot;Langley Silt&quot;) deposits which overlie parts of the Thames terrace deposits.

==Human history==

===Pre-Roman to Norman history===
So extensive have the changes to this landscape been that what little evidence there is of man&#x27;s presence before the ice came has inevitably shown signs of transportation here by water and reveals nothing specifically local. Likewise, later evidence of occupation, even since the arrival of the Romans, may lie next to the original banks of the Brent but have been buried under centuries of silt.

The most prominent pre-Roman settlement on the River Brent was apparently at Brentford. This Bronze Age site pre-dates the Roman occupation of Britain, and thus predates the founding of London itself. Many pre-Roman artifacts have been excavated in and around the area in Brentford known as &#x27;Old England&#x27;. The quality and quantity of the artefacts suggests that Brentford was a meeting point for pre-Roman tribes. One well-known Iron Age piece from about 100 BC to AD 50 is the Brentford horncap - a ceremonial chariot fitting that formed part of local antiquarian Thomas Layton&#x27;s collection, now held by the Museum of London. Odd Roman artifacts have also been found by the River Brent in both Brentford and Hanwell, suggesting that a trading route may have used the river to trade with the early villages in Roman and post-Roman times.

However, can the river Brent be considered a border in the sense that the quality it possessed of dividing the land was notable enough to be given such a descriptive title? The Brent river valley in 705 would have looked very different to today. Before modern day dredging, the river was wider and shallower. Before the construction of its weirs, the Brent reservoir and Grand Union Canal (and its Paddington Branch, which takes much of the Brent&#x27;s waters) the river would have flooded more frequently than it does today. The alluvial valley floor would therefore have been swamp. On Google Earth, the signs of many of the old drainage channels that turned the marsh into water meadow are still visible. Bordering these marshes would have been dense thickets of thorn and willow. A link can be made with the local area, the south-west plains of Middlesex, forming the Anglo-Saxon founded Hundreds of Elthorne [shelter tree, &quot;from&quot; Helethorne with the &#x27;h&#x27; being lost to elision], and Spelthorne (perhaps speech/discourse tree).


The earliest surviving reference to the then village of Hanwell is in 959, when it is recorded as &quot;Hanewelle&quot; in pledge, when Alfwyn (a Saxon) pawned his land for money to go on a pilgrimage. It was only a small hamlet on the river banks in the 10th century.

Another conjecture is that one of the possible etymologies given for this ancient parish of Hanwell is &#x27;Han&#x27; as Saxon for boundary stone and &#x27;well&#x27; as Saxon for fresh water or spring. The Rectory Cottage to the parish church of St Mary has a large stone of about a ton in its garden. A large land owner and historian also put forward the observation that this appeared to line up with what he maintained as traces of the parish being divided up into the Roman centuria unit of land area, indicating that they used this stone as a datum. However, the position of the field boundaries and roads still wait to be statistically analysed to test this hypothesis.

Nevertheless, a cursory inspection of old Ordnance Survey maps, blended with an appreciation of how hedges and boundary paths drift with time and use, strongly suggests that they approximated to dimensions of the &quot;quintarial limes&quot; of the Roman field system by a degree that far exceeds what would be expected by chance alone. Hanwell parish was very narrow in the east–west direction. The letter of 705 calling a meeting at Brentford to resolve a dispute between the East Saxons and the West Saxons; as early as this the Brent was recognised as a convenient halfway point or boundary. Other later historically important meetings are also recorded here.

Going back a little further, etymological evidence of the West Saxons renaming settlements to the west including the Chilterns to the north west can be seen in their many place name endings such as &quot;field&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;ton&quot;, and &quot;worth&quot; but at the Brent they almost stop — the course of the river presenting a boundary between lands named by the invading Saxons to the west and lands retaining the last vestiges of Romano-British London which lasted until the end of the 5th century, having in many cases, older names.
Evidence of Roman settlement, that was discovered by the Hendon and District Archaeological Society and others exists in an urn burial of a headless child was found in nearby Sunny Hill Park. Hendon manor is described in Domesday (1087), but the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;[æt þǣm] hēam dūne&quot; meaning &#x27;[at the] high hill&#x27;, is earlier.

===Post-Norman history===
The course of the river has demarcated sub-tribal then administrative divisions. It marked the boundary of Middlesex and Hertfordshire and at a lower, less important level, Gore Hundred and the Liberty of St Albans (also known as the Hundred of Cashio).

By the Middle Ages malaria had reached Britain: locally endemic in the south. The main instances were among shepherds (shearing marsh wool) and fishermen along the Thames as well as at Romney Marsh, following which the major lower Thames tributaries may have been seen for a time as unhealthy for settlement on their immediate banks; many adages of marsh and bog may date to this period. At places where river gravel beds formed a firm river bed fording was safe. Some such fording places were the Roman road crossing in Brentford itself, elevated to the status of a bridge in medieval times, in part funded by a small tax on Jews crossing the bridge, Green Lanes in Hanwell (a reminder that this was an old droving route, the word &#x27;green&#x27; signifying that livestock could graze whilst on their last journey), and Hanwell Bridge on the Uxbridge Road. With only a few fordable places along the river&#x27;s course, this presented an ideal natural defensive barrier.

The original parish of Hanwell took in Boston Manor and Brentford, running three and a half miles north from the river&#x27;s discharge but about one seventh the width. It separated the curacy of Norwood Green (west) and Ealing (specifically Gunnersbury manor) east. To the north it bordered Greenford and Perivale also using the river. Hanwell is only just over wide along the east–west line of the Uxbridge Road. The river&#x27;s line, before the draining of the marshes, formed a natural boundary between the different pre- and post-Roman tribes of the south-east of England.

Certain accounts of the Romantic Period have speculation from its propensity to suggest regular links to druids, or of some other ancient religious deity, all which alluded more to fancy with which to delight the readers of the new vogue in travelogues, rather than the result of any serious study, the true history of the river Brent from these cannot be made out.

The London Borough of Brent derived its name from the river when in 1965 the boroughs of Willesden and Wembley chose a name when uniting. This is also reflected in the coat of arms of the borough, showing a stylized river in the shield.

=== Earliest recorded reference===
Brentford was a likely site of a battle recorded by Julius Cæsar between Julius Cæsar and local king, Cassivellaunus, in 54 BC.

A letter from the Bishop of London in 705 suggesting a meeting at Breguntford, now Brentford, is the earliest record of this place and of the river.

==River&#x27;s course==

===From source and Dollis Brook to Brent Reservoir===


The River Brent starts as the junction of Dollis Brook and Mutton Brook close to Bridge Lane in Hendon, in the London Borough of Barnet.

Its main tributary is Dollis Brook, around long, which rises in Moat Mount Open Space, Mill Hill, and flows eastward through fields and open space to King George V Playing Fields in Totteridge. It then turns south and passes between Totteridge and Whetstone. A tributary, Folly Brook, meets the Dollis not far from Woodside Park tube station. The Dollis then flows through Church End, Finchley, to Hendon.

Mutton Brook rises in Cherry Tree Wood, East Finchley. It flows westward, underground, until it comes to the surface shortly after The Bishop&#x27;s Avenue, and then flows through parks next to Lyttelton Road, Falloden Way and North Circular Road to meet the Dollis.

A small stream called Decoy Brook rises in Turner&#x27;s Wood in Hampstead Garden Suburb and runs through Temple Fortune to join the Brent at the end of Brent Street in Hendon. Another, Clitterhouse Stream, rises at two locations on the western slopes of Hampstead Heath. One brook feeds the Leg of Mutton Pond on West Heath, and the lower duck pond of Golders Hill Park. On the bank of the stream by Leg of Mutton Pond lies the site of a Stone Age encampment, which was excavated by the Hendon and District Archaeological Society in the 1970s. Another brook feeds the upper duck pond in Golders Hill Park and then flows to merge with the other branch at the lower duck pond. From Golders Hill Park the stream flows underground approximately in parallel with Dunstan Road to Childs Hill Park. At Granville Road, at the south end of the park, a laundry industry once used the clean water of the stream as did a nursery industry, now all disappeared. From Granville Road the stream flows underground to emerge at Clitterhouse Playing Fields and joins the Brent at Brent Cross shopping centre.

The River Brent flows alongside the A406 North Circular Road through Brent Park and then under the Northern line to Brent Cross and the Brent Reservoir, where it is joined by another tributary, the Silk Stream. There are several feeders to the Silk Stream including Burnt Oak Brook, Edgware Brook and Deans Brook.

===From Brent Reservoir to Brentford===
From here, still closely following the North Circular Road, the river passes Stonebridge Park station, where it is joined by Wembley (Rowlands) Brook, which rises in Vale farm near Sudbury. The river continues under an aqueduct carrying the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal. From Stonebridge Park the river turns westward, and flows under the A40 Western Avenue, past the Lilburne walk into Tokyngton Recreation Ground in Harlesden, and through the adjacent Brent River Park for three miles until it reaches Perivale. It then runs through Perivale Park past the local running track and under the railway bridge and into Stockdove Way crossing Argyle Road at the traffic lights into Perivale Lane, where it joins up with the foot/cyclepath at St Mary&#x27;s the Virgin Perivale through to Pitshanger Park. The river runs through Longfield / Perivale East Meadow and Pitshanger Riverside meadows.

This part of the river, as it passes through the southern boundary of Perivale Park Golf Course, is joined from the north by Costons Brook. It was dredged deeper in the 1960s and a control weir built, to reduce the risk of flooding, especially of Costons Lane, along which there is a flood protection wall. Previously, Ruislip Road East would also regularly become impassable.

The river then swings south again at Greenford Bridge to Hanwell, a mile away across the fields. The river runs by the local cyclepath, along the northern pavement over Greenford Bridge and into Costons Lane before turning eastwards into Perivale Park.

The river continues southeastward past St. Mary&#x27;s Church. It flows under the Great Western Railway at the 900-foot-long (270 m) Wharncliffe Viaduct, a high spanned railway viaduct carrying the main-line railway from Paddington to the west of England.

Within about , the River Brent is joined from the west by the main line of the Grand Union Canal at the foot of the Hanwell flight of locks, below Lock 97. From here, the Brent is canalised and navigable — the river and canal pass through Osterley Lock (98), Clitheroe&#x27;s Lock (99) and Brentford Gauging Locks (100). It finally joins the tidal River Thames at Thames tidal locks - 101 in Old Brentford, a mile upstream of Kew Bridge.

The river intersects with the north to south Capital Ring, Section 8, which runs alongside it from Osterley Lock to Greenford.

==Industrial heritage ==

===Brentford Dock===

Brentford Dock in west London was a major transshipment point between the Great Western Railway (GWR) and barges on the River Thames. The building of Brentford Dock was started in 1855 and it was formally opened in 1859. The dock yard was redeveloped in 1972 and is now Brentford Dock Marina and Brentford Dock Estate.

===Brent Reservoir ===

The Brent Reservoir (popularly called the Welsh Harp Reservoir) is a reservoir which straddles the boundary between the London boroughs of Brent and Barnet and is owned by British Waterways. The reservoir takes its informal name from a public house called The Welsh Harp, which stood nearby until the early 1970s.

In a recent survey, a large number fish were captured in the reservoir and adjoining parts of the River Brent and Silk Stream, 95% of which were Roach. However, fishing is prohibited in the reservoir itself.

The plans for the construction laid in 1803 were abandoned because of cost, but by 1820 there was not enough water to supply the Grand Union Canal and the Regent&#x27;s Canal, so under an Act of Parliament in 1819, the Regent&#x27;s Canal Company decided to dam the River Brent and create a reservoir in order to guarantee a sufficient water supply for their canals during drier weather, an accidental damming of the feeder streams and similar times of need.

The reservoir was constructed by William Hoof between 1834 and 1835. The water flooded much of Cockman&#x27;s Farm, to supply the Regent&#x27;s Canal at Paddington. It was called &quot;Kingsbury Reservoir&quot; and its spread between Old Kingsbury Church and Edgware Road. Hoof, who was awarded the tender for the work (including the construction of a bridge) received the sum of £2,740 6s. In August 1835, a few months before completion, four brothers named Sidebottom drowned in an accident.

The Welsh Harp Conservation Group (WHCG) managed in 1972 to fight off a local development plan. The WHCG organises management work, such as annual refurbishment of the tern rafts and works with Brent and Barnet councils on the site&#x27;s management, including applying for National Lottery bids.

==Parks and nature reserves ==

===Lower Dollis Brook SINC===

Soon after its source in Hendon the river runs through Brent Park (Hendon), and the park and the first part of the river until it passes under the Northern line are part of the &quot;Lower Dollis Brook&quot; Site Borough of Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade II.

===Brent River Park===

Brent River Park is one of London&#x27;s larger urban green spaces. The natural landscape has recently been improved through the River Brent Project and further plans are proposed for future improvements. A new cycle path and wildlife conservation areas were opened in 2008. The borough&#x27;s riverside park land community space will have its suitability for informal ball games improved over the next few years under the River Brent Project. The spaces are also popular with local dog walkers, children people out walking and local nature lovers.

The whole of Brent River Park/ River Brent Park area is now designated as a nature conservation area and was so popular it received the Mayor of London&#x27;s seal of approval by winning £400,000 for park projects and improvements in 2009, through the mayoral assembly&#x27;s West London Priority Parks Award. The park is now full of flora and fauna, along with its adjacent meadows and colonies of bats.

===Perivale East Meadow and Pitshanger Riverside Meadows===

The three meadows of Longfield/Perivale East Meadow and Pitshanger Riverside Meadows (part of Brent River Park) with natural riverbanks form part of the River Brent flood plain home to mallard ducks, moorhens, kingfishers and grey wagtails. Herons can also be seen along the river. It also passes through Perivale Park, which has had a few herons recently.

===Tokyngton Park===

The River Brent also enters Tokyngton Park in Tokyngton, Brent. The extensive flood prevention work undertaken during both the 1940s and 1970s, had led to this section of river in Tokyngton Park in Tokyngton, Brent, being straightened and enclosed in concrete. The river thus provided little or no recreational value to the local populace, whilst the quality of wildlife habitat was poor. During 1999, a local partnership was formed between the local authority, the Environment agency, local community groups and local firms, to implement improvements to the park for both people and wildlife.

The park can be accessed either locally by foot or via an official urban walking route from Hanwell railway station and Brent Lodge Park; Perivale tube or most stops served by the 95 bus service. Car parking is plentiful in the streets adjacent to Hanwell railway station. To return to the start of the walk, take the 95 bus from Western Avenue to Greenford Red Lion, then the E3 bus to Hanwell railway station. Public toilets can be found in Brent Lodge Park.

===Brent Lodge Park and the Churchfields===

Brent Lodge Park (or BLP) and Churchfields, which is located The Brent River Park, is a pocket of the countryside within the now urban environment of the London Borough of Ealing. the park is bordered by the River Brent on the west and south and has become one of the favourite places for locals to go for tranquillity and chilling out.

The park got an EU/Department for Communities and Local Government Green Flag Award in 2009. Brent River and Canal Society with local park ranger Tony Ord look after the park.

Brent Lodge Park and the Churchfields is another park along the course of the river as it passes through Ealing. The park is accessible from Hanwell train station by either the E3 and E1 on bus stops on Greenford Avenue, then the 83, 92, 195, 207, 282, 427 and 607 stops on the Uxbridge Road and Ealing Hospital, or a short walk to the entrance on the land by the hospital or via West Middlesex Golf Course. Vehicular parking is limited within the car park at the end of Church Road and parking along Church Road being restricted during summer and weekends. The hospital&#x27;s park is only for the hospital staff, patients and visitors to use.

It contains both public toilets, a café, animal centre and Millennium maze. The extensive hay meadows and grand trees making it a great place to spot many forms of fauna and flora.

Within the bounds of the site there is a grade 2 listed stable block (it contains an animal centre) which is the only remains of the old manor house, which sadly burned down in the 1930s.

===Wembley riverside walk ===
A public riverside walk (Wembley riverside walk) leads to Wembley Stadium. The River Brent &amp; Grand Union Canal Circular Tour and Ealing Cycling Campaign Routes and Rides follow part of the River Brent. Where the route follows the River Brent, it does so as closely as possible on well-made paths and roads.

==Notable buildings==
Ealing Hospital was re-built near the banks of the River Brent in the 1970s, on the same site as St Bernard&#x27;s Hospital, dating back to 1832 (as Hanwell Asylum).

Within the bounds of the site of Brent Lodge Park and the Churchfields there is a grade 2 listed stable block (it contains an animal centre) which is the only remains of the old manor house, which sadly burned down in the 1930s.

==Environmental issues==

===Pollution===
The River Brent was badly polluted from 1886 after contamination caused by sewage disposal outlets, rubber works and the early oil industry. The more recent rise in the rate of motor traffic has also become a major reason behind modern day, upstream pollution.

High sewage levels had killed off the local trout at Brentford by the early 1920s. The river was cleaned out and the sewage sent into a separate underground pipe by World War II. A few trout began to return in the 1990s.

The water quality upstream in the River Brent, and urban diffuse pollution, affected biological oxygen levels in Ealing 
and the area in Brent is affected by diffuse urban pollution and drain misconnections as of 2010.

The Silk Stream tributary was still the victim of at least one sewage outflow pipe in 2010.

Thames Water was called in 2010 to replace a collapsed sewer pipe in Queens Walk, Ealing but found that a stretch of town houses were in fact not properly connected to the sewage system when they had been built in 2000; for 10 years their effluent had been carried into the River Brent. The Environment Agency&#x27;s, environment management team leader, Sarah Mills, said: &quot;Approximately eight to nine town houses have been found to be misconnected, which Thames Water have advised would have occurred when they were built around the year 2000.&quot;
A later, but thankfully much smaller, sewage leak occurred nearby on 3 April 2011.

===Culverting and flood alleviation works ===
Corseting or embanking (to form dry land embankments known in the US as levees) mostly took place in the 20th century, along most of the course. The banks&#x27; width could be reduced due to water retained by the Canal Feeder. The mid-course of the river had been about deep, rising to about when it caused local flooding. Local flood alleviation work has mostly taken place from the 1940s to the 1970s, as Brent&#x27;s Tokyngton Park. Brentford&#x27;s section has been modified, cleansed and dredged several times since the late 19th century.

The River Brent, proto-Brent River Park and surrounding area almost became a section of the Greater London Council&#x27;s flood prevention scheme plans for Ealing in the 1970s. The Brent flood prevention scheme was finally completed in the 1980s.

The intermittent flooding in the 1970s was causing significant damage to buildings in Greenford&#x27;s Costons Lane area and roads and parkland. The then controversial proposal was to channel the Brent into a concrete trough, possibly covered with a concrete lid, some 75 ft wide.
The planned scheme had allowed natural flood plains, away from housing, roads and riverside footpaths to soak up the excessive water flow to reduce the level of flooding through the passage of the flood water into the underlying ground water level.

Parts of the river&#x27;s course that had been buried under concrete for most of the 20th century were planned to be uncovered to revitalise the area in 2008.

==Environmental regeneration==

===The Brent River and Canal Society (BRCS) ===
The Brent River and Canal Society (BRCS) volunteer group was founded in 1972 by several Hanwell residents, led by Luke Fitzherbert, under the umbrella of Hanwell Preservation Society, had taken the initiative to clear the river of two years&#x27; worth of dumped rubbish.

The society went on to campaign vigorously in the 1970s for the creation of Brent River Park, which was set up in 1975, saving it from use in Greater London Council&#x27;s flood alleviation scheme plans for the London Borough of Ealing at the time. There were mostly plans to resolve extensive flooding which occurred periodically in the Perivale and Ealing areas. The Brent flood alleviation scheme was finally completed in the 1980s. Ultimately, this helped to achieve the Brent River and Canal Society objectives of a continuous urban walk along the river&#x27;s course from Hanger Lane to Brentford. The first was Fitzherbert Walk, which passes over the river from Hanwell Bridge on the Uxbridge Road to where the river joins the Grand Union Canal opened in 1983 and was named after Luke Fitzherbert. A new footpath underneath the Wharncliffe Viaduct in Hanwell was opened in 1985 and is now part of the National Footpaths recognised walk, the Capital Ring.

===Local community projects===
There was a litter removal operation on the 19 and 20 August 2010, in Brent Lodge Park, Hanwell. Volunteers cleared up litter from river and banks to help improve the area for residents and wildlife. The clean-up was to be followed by some family fun activities from 1pm-5pm, including river dipping and refreshments.

School children from Alperton Community School were also involved in an Active Citizen Scheme along with the Environment Agency, to remind people not to pollute the Wealdstone Brook and River Brent through the abuse of the street surface water drains who conclude that littering, old plumbing and disposing of waste such as engine oil are destroying local fish spawning grounds.

February 2011 saw several community projects launched to clean up the River Brent to reduce the risk of damage to local fish spawning grounds.

===River Brent Project regeneration scheme===

The River Brent Project regeneration scheme is aimed at improving the local environment, wild live habitat and flood prevention.

====Work at Tokyngton Park, Brent====

The extensive flood prevention work undertaken during both the 1940s and 1970s had led to this section of river in Tokyngton Park in Tokyngton, Brent, being straightened and enclosed in concrete. The river thus provided little or no recreational value to the local populace, whilst the quality of wildlife habitat was poor. During 1999, a local partnership was formed between the local authority, the Environment agency, local community groups and local firms, to implement improvements to the park for both people and wildlife.

It was hoped that this provides a new lease of life for the river and enhances the quality of the local environment by removing the river from its concrete banks and to create an attractive public open space. The existing concrete river channelling and casing would be removed and the river&#x27;s course modified to create new meanders in the middle area of the &#x27;River Park&#x27; zone. The removal of some existing paths and provide new and the provision some new street furniture and a fixed fibre glass gazebo would also occur if further plans go forth.
It will also try to emphasise on community participation in the local project.

===The Brent Cross Cricklewood development===

Under plans for the Brent Cross Cricklewood development, the River Brent, which is currently (as of May 2011) in a 40-year-old concrete channel, and its tributary Clitterhouse Stream will be realigned and restored to a more natural state, incorporating a wetland environmental area and a public riverside walkway. Flood risk is to be reduced by restoring the flood plain and the addition of sustainable drainage, such as green roofs and water-permeable paving to reduce surface water, and thus flooding, in future times of heavy rain. New bridges over the river are to be designed so that they will be less easily blocked during a flood. According to the UK Government&#x27;s Environment Agency, the development will provide opportunities to adapt the site to climate change, and give the community attractive recreational space and improved wildlife areas. Involved parties are Scott Wilson Group, RPS, ERM Consultants, Joseph Partners and the London Borough of Barnet.

== Notable floods ==
The earliest flood record is 1682.

* 1682: A very violent storm of rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning, caused a sudden flood, which did great damage to the town of Brentford. The whole place was overflown; boats rowed up and down the streets, and several houses and other buildings were carried away by the force of the waters.
* 1841: Brentford was flooded by the Brent Reservoir becoming overfull so that the overflow cut a breach in the earth dam. A wave of frothing and roaring water swept down the river&#x27;s course taking all before it causing fatalities. Several people died.
* 1976 and 1977: in the summer Britain saw drought and unusual heat with Water Companies declaring it would take six or seven years for empty reservoirs to recover. The following August, a rainy spell was followed by a day and night of torrential rain that overwhelmed the Brent reservoir — authorities decided to open the sluice gates maximally at time of highest volume and pressure, to avoid costly overflow flooding, having been under general pressure to keep stock water supplies. Later, before the river below overflowed in many sections certain local sewers overflowed, some into homes. The streets, including arterial roads were jammed and local trains blocked. Hundreds of homes and businesses closed for the clean-up, with widespread press coverage.
* 2007: August saw heavy rain cause a short bout of flash flooding in Brentford and Hanwell on roads, the Hounslow Loop Line and London Underground.
* 2009: On 30 November, the Environment Agency warned residents of a flooding along River Brent from Hendon to Brentford, after a day of notably heavy rain. Several premises were temporarily flooded in Brentford and Perivale.

==In literature and poetry ==
Poet Laureate John Betjeman in his poem &quot;Middlesex&quot;:
The anthropomorphic personification of the river appears as one of the daughters of Mama Thames in the novel &quot;Rivers of London&quot;.

<doc id="922794" wikidata="Q4393028" url="?curid=922794" title="Religion in Singapore">
<text>Religion in Singapore is characterised by a wide variety of religious beliefs and practices due to its diverse ethnic mix of people originating from various parts of the world. A secular state, Singapore is commonly termed as a &quot;melting pot&quot; or &quot;cultural mosaic &quot; of various religious practices originating from different religions and religious denominations around the world. Most major religious denominations are present in the country, with the Singapore-based Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO) recognising 10 major religions. A 2014 analysis by the Pew Research Center found Singapore to be the world&#x27;s most religiously diverse nation.

The most followed religion in Singapore is Buddhism, with a plurality of 31.1% of the resident population identifying themselves as adherents at the most recent decennial census in 2020. A large number of Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese, with 40.4% of the ethnic Chinese population in Singapore identifying as Buddhist. Sizeable numbers of non-Chinese ethnic groups in Singapore also practice Buddhism. People with no religious affiliation (atheist, agnostic or other irreligious life stances) form the second largest group at 20% of the population. Christianity comes in at 18.9%. Islam, at 15.6%, is followed mainly by Malays, though there are also many Indians adhering to it. Taoism comes in at 8%. Hinduism, at 5%, is followed mainly by Indians.

==History and culture==
The Armenian Church of Gregory the Illuminator is the oldest church in Singapore, having been completed in 1836. It was also the first building in Singapore to have an electricity supply, having had the first electric fans and lights. Today, the church no longer holds Armenian services, as the last Armenian priest retired in the 1930s. Nonetheless, the church and its grounds have been preserved, with various Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Oriental Orthodox Church services still held in it.

In the middle of the 20th century, a number of race and religion-related riots occurred in Singapore, including the Maria Hertogh riots and the 1964 Race Riots. The Singapore government has since adopted a policy of promoting religious tolerance in Singapore. However, some religions or denominations are officially banned by the government, as they are deemed as cults, such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the Unification Church, although their followers practised in secrecy in the 2010s. 

Some religions, especially those practised by Chinese ethnic groups, have merged their places of worship with other religions such as Hinduism and Islam, such as the Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple. Additionally, South Bridge Street, a major road through the old Chinatown, houses the Sri Mariamman Temple and the Masjid Jamae Mosque, which served Chulia Muslims from India&#x27;s Coromandel Coast.

Most Singaporeans celebrate the major festivals associated with their respective religions. The variety of religions is a direct reflection of the diversity of races: The Chinese are mainly Buddhists, Taoists, Christian, Muslim or irreligious. Malays are predominantly Muslims (98.8%), while Indians are mostly Hindus (57.3%), but with significant numbers of Muslims, Buddhists, Christians and Sikhs from the Indian ethnic groups.

Taoist and Confucian doctrines and deities, together with ancestral worship, are combined in various ways in the Chinese folk religions and Chinese folk religious sects.

==Statistics and demographics==
The Singapore census includes detailed data on religion and ethnicity, and is taken on a ten or five-year basis. 


The figures for the percent of Singaporeans practiced religion by ethnicity for the past four decades are as follows:


Below are the Singapore&#x27;s Resident Population Aged 15 years and over by Religion and Age Group:

The above figures refer to the resident population only, and do not include the non-resident population (Singapore authorities do not release figures for the non-resident population, which accounted for 18.33% of Singapore&#x27;s population in 2005).

==Major religious communities==
===Buddhism===


A plurality of Singaporeans declared themselves as Buddhists, with 31.1% of the Singaporean population being Buddhists in the 2020 census.

Most missionaries hail from China, Tibet, Taiwan, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Japan. There are Buddhist monasteries and centres from the three major traditions of Buddhism in Singapore: Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana. Most Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese and many of them adhere to Mahayana tradition. Whilst a majority of Buddhists in Singapore are traditionally ethnic Chinese, there are also Buddhists in Singapore that come from other ethnic groups such as the Thai, Sinhalese and Burmese. Due to the presence of Buddhists from these ethnic groups, there are Buddhist centres and temples that serve these communities, such as Wat Ananda Metyarama Thai Buddhist Temple, Sri Lankaramaya Buddhist Temple and Burmese Buddhist Temple. Buddhism of every tradition is generally represented in Singapore, including Tibetan Buddhism, Thai Buddhism and Chinese Mahayana Buddhism

Below is the ethnic breakdown of Buddhists according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:

===Christianity===

18.9% of Singaporeans identified as Christians in the 2020 census. Of these, 35.8% or 220,900 people identified as Catholics. Among Protestants, the Methodist Church in Singapore is the largest denomination, with some 42,000 members in 46 churches, as well as Orthodox. Prominent megachurches have emerged over the last two decades with the rise of the charismatic movement; these include New Creation Church, City Harvest Church and Faith Community Baptist Church, which count among Singapore&#x27;s 10 largest charities, according to a report by The Straits Times in 2019.

Below are the ethnic breakdown of Christians according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:

===Islam===

According to the 2020 census, 15.6% of the resident population declared themselves Muslims. Most mosques in Singapore cater to Sunni Muslims due to the vast majority of Singaporean Muslims adhering to the Sunni Shafi&#x27;i or Hanafi school of thought, although there are mosques that cater to the needs of the Shia community as well. There are approximately 200 Ahmadi. Singapore also contains the oldest Muslim women&#x27;s organisation in the world: Young Women Muslim Association of Singapore.

Whilst a majority of Muslims in Singapore are traditionally ethnic Malays, there is also a significantly growing number of Muslims from other ethnic groups. There is a sizeable number of Muslims amongst ethnic Indians that include Tamil Muslims and ethnic Pakistanis in Singapore as well. For this reason, a number of mosques (mostly Tamil-speaking) specifically cater to the needs of the Indian Muslim community. Additionally, under the direction of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), English is increasingly being used as the language of administration, religious instruction and sermons for Friday prayers in mosques across Singapore to cater to Muslims who may not necessarily be Malay-speaking.

Below is the ethnic breakdown of Muslims according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:

===Taoism===
According to the 2020 Census, 8.8% of Singaporeans declared themselves as Taoist.

Followers of Taoism (&quot;The Way&quot;) adhere to the teachings of the ancient Chinese religious philosophy of Laozi, the founder of Taoism, also known as the Pure Celestial Worthy of the Way. Besides codified Taoism—which in some places, like Taiwan, is mostly represented by the Zhengyi order—Taoism in Singapore also includes a wide variety of Chinese folk religious traditions and various other religions.

Ancestral worship is a common practice of the Chinese and the Qingming Festival during the second full moon is observed by the majority. This reflects that Chinese tradition remains extant in modern Singapore. They pray in tribute to their bereaved ancestors, where their spirits are honoured with offerings including food, beverages, joss paper, incense sticks, and even paper houses, which are intrinsic practices for Taoists.

Although Taoist temples and shrines are abundant in Singapore, the official number of followers has dwindled drastically over the years from 22.4% to 8.5% between the years 1990 to 2000. This, however, may be accounted for by the unclear delineation between Taoism and Buddhism in popular perception. For example, the difference between the two religions can be negligible enough that when a Chinese says that they &quot;offer incense sticks&quot; it is usually assumed that they are Buddhist even though they may not actually be Buddhist. The 2010 and 2015 censuses have shown that Taoist identity has declined again to represent about 10% of Singapore&#x27;s population.

Below are the ethnic breakdown of Taoists according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:

===Hinduism===
According to the latest 2020 census, 5.0% of Singaporeans declare themselves as Hindus.

The majority of Singapore&#x27;s present Hindus are descendants of Indians who migrated soon after the founding of Singapore in 1819. The early temples are still the central points of rituals and festivals, which are held throughout the year.
Below are the ethnic breakdown of Hindus according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:

===Sikhism===
The first Sikhs to settle in Singapore came in 1849. As of 2020 Census, there are 12,051 Sikhs (approximately 0.35% of the whole population) was registered in Singapore.

Below are the ethnic breakdown of Sikhs according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:

==Small religious communities==
===Jainism===
The Jain community celebrated 100 years in Singapore by rededicating the &quot;Stanak&quot; and consecrating the idol of Mahavira. This brought together the two main sects of Jains, the Śvētāmbara and Digambara. The Singapore Jain Religious Society actively engages in keeping traditions and practices alive by transmitting Jain principles to the next generation. It also has a strong history of community involvement. The Jains have no temple, but the Singapore Jain Religious Society has a building on 18 Jalan Yasin.

As of 2006, there were 1,000 Jains in Singapore.

===Zoroastrianism===
There is a small community of about 300 Parsi Zoroastrians residing in Singapore. There is no fire temple in Singapore, but Zoroastrian House is home to the Parsi Zoroastrian Association of South East Asia, and contains a prayer hall for the community.

===Judaism===
The first Jews to settle in Singapore came from India in 1819. As of 2008, there are still Jews in Singapore. Their religious activities centre around two synagogues, the Maghain Aboth Synagogue and the Chesed-El Synagogue.

There were over 1,500 Jewish inhabitants in 1939. Many were interned during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II, and a number subsequently emigrated to Australia, England, the United States, and Israel. As a result, the community numbered approximately 450 in 1968. In 2005, the number reached 300. Because of a large Ashkenazi immigration rate to Singapore in recent years, the population is now between 800 and 1,000, mostly foreign Ashkenazi Jews.

===Bahá&#x27;í Faith===
K. M. Fozdar (1898–1958) and Shirin Fozdar (1905–1992), were the first to introduce the Bahá&#x27;í Faith to Singapore when they settled here in 1950. Shirin Fozdar was well known throughout Singapore and Asia for her work in the cause of women&#x27;s emancipation. Her arrival in Singapore had been preceded by an article in The Straits Times on 15 September 1950 under the heading &quot;A Woman with a Message&quot;. Through the efforts of Dr and Mrs Fozdar, by 1952 there were enough Bahá&#x27;ís in Singapore to form the first Local Spiritual Assembly. The community has since grown to over 2000 members and today there are five Local Spiritual Assemblies in Singapore.

Local Spiritual Assemblies oversee a wide range of activities including the education of children, devotional services, study classes, discussion groups, social functions, observance of holy days, marriages and funeral services. Bahá&#x27;í marriage is recognised under the laws of Singapore and the solemniser is appointed by the Registrar of Marriages. The Bahá&#x27;ís have been provided with a cemetery in Choa Chu Kang since 1957 and the nine Bahá&#x27;í Holy Days have been gazetted since 1972. Members of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá&#x27;ís of Singapore, incorporated 28 July 1952. The five Local Spiritual Assemblies come under the jurisdiction of the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá&#x27;ís of Singapore, the national governing council which was established in 1972.

The national governing council also appoints the executive members of the various offices which plan and carry out social service projects and collaborate with government and non-government organisations. The Bahá&#x27;í teachings stress the importance of obedience to civil government and laws. While Bahá&#x27;ís may accept non-partisan government appointments, they do not engage in partisan political activity. The members firmly uphold the injunction of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, that &#x27;they must behave towards the government with loyalty, honesty and truthfulness&#x27;.

There is no Baha&#x27;i House of Worship in Singapore, but there is a Baha&#x27;i Centre that serves as the administrative headquarters of the religion in Singapore.

==New religious movements==
===Brahma Kumaris===
The Brahma Kumaris are a millenarian spiritual movement that originated in Hyderabad, Sindh in modern-day Pakistan in the 1930s. Founded by spiritualist and medium Lekhraj Kripalani, originally a follower of the Vaishnavite Vallabhacharya sect, the movement is known for the prominent role played by celibate women in it, and purports to teach an ancient form of meditation known as Raja Yoga. The group has since distanced itself from its Hindu roots, preferring to use the language of New Age and personal growth movements to draw students. Followers believe in an imminent &quot;End of the World&quot; situation that is slated to happen before 2036 but in more recent teachings, leaders have downplayed many of the apocalyptic prophecies of the destruction of the planet revealed earlier. Many of the group&#x27;s beliefs, referred to as &quot;The Knowledge&quot;, are largely kept hidden from outsiders. The Singapore Brahma Kumaris Centre operates out of its Hindoo Road location in Little India.

===Christian Science===
Christian Science is a non-trinitarian Christian new religious movement developed by Mary Baker Eddy who argued in her 1875 book &quot;Science and Health&quot; that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone. She founded the Church of Christ, Scientist in 1879 with 26 followers. The church is known for its Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;. In Singapore, the church holds weekly Sunday Services at The Regent Hotel on Cuscaden Road.

===Eckankar===
Eckankar, a new religious movement founded by Paul Twitchell in 1965, is active in Singapore through the Eckankar Satsang Singapore. There is no published data available on the size of the group, which holds meetings at Peace Centre.

===Falun Gong===
Falun Gong is a new religious movement founded in China by Li Hongzhi in the early 1990s. Riding on the &quot;qigong&quot; boom and initially enjoying support from Chinese officialdom, the movement was estimated to have 70 million practitioners in 1999. The Chinese government soon denounced the group as a cult and embarked on a nationwide crackdown. The group was registered as the Falun Buddha Society in 1996 and is headquartered at Geylang Road. The association is believed to have some 500 to 1,000 practitioners in Singapore, and publishes the Singapore edition of &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; in English and Chinese. In January 2001, 15 Falun Gong practitioners, mostly Chinese nationals, were charged with illegal assembly after organising an unauthorised vigil at a park in memory of fellow believers they say died in police custody in China. In July 2006, nine members were charged with disseminating material encouraging people to quit the Chinese Communist Party, and another three members were charged with meditating and going on hunger strike outside the Chinese embassy.

===Hare Krishna===
The Hare Krishna movement is active in Singapore but not through the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) which was banned by the government in the 1970s and remains banned today. Foreign ISKCON monks as well as Srila Prabhupada, founder of the movement, were barred by wary government authorities from entering Singapore, and all attempts by followers to officially register the society failed. Nevertheless, by avoiding affiliation with ISKCON, Hare Krishna followers have subsequently succeeded in registering their societies under different names. These include the Sri Krishna Mandir in Geylang and the Gita Reading Society at the Gauranga Centre in Serangoon.

===Mata Amritanandamayi Math===
The Mata Amritanandamayi Math is a new Hindu movement established in 1981 by Indian guru Mātā Amritānandamayī Devī, popularly referred to by her followers as &quot;Amma&quot;, or by the media as the &quot;hugging saint&quot;. Singapore was the destination of her first trip out of India in 1987 and since then, she has made frequent visits to the city-state, often attracting tens of thousands to darshan events in recent years. The Amriteswari Society was registered in Singapore in 1993 and is located at Hindoo Road in Little India.

===Latter-day Saints===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints first began holding meetings in 1963 with a handful of followers that were living in Singapore in 1963. Church membership grew to about 100 in 1970 when the government began restricting proselytisation and visas for missionaries. In 1974, the church created the Singapore Mission, with G. Carlos Smith as the mission president. By January 1980, Singapore was opened to full-time missionaries. As of 2021, the church claims about 3,400 members in the country and operates three chapels in Bukit Timah, Pasir Panjang, and Sengkang. In August 1992, Jon Huntsman Jr., a Latter-day Saint was appointed as the United States Ambassador to Singapore. He served less than a year and left in June 1993. 21 Latter-day Saint missionaries have reportedly been sent out from Singapore to 15 countries. On 4 April 2021 at the 191st Annual General Conference, Church President Russell M. Nelson announced plans to construct a temple in Singapore. The Singapore Temple will be located on Pasir Panjang road.

===Nichiren Shōshū===
Nichiren Shōshū is a branch of Nichiren Buddhism based on the teachings of the 13th-century Japanese priest Nichiren. The Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist Association (Singapore) is located at Sims Avenue. A schism in Japan in 1991 saw the excommunication of Soka Gakkai out of Nichiren Shōshū, following which the respective branches in Singapore also parted ways.

===Quan Yin Famen===
The Quan Yin Famen, or the Quan Yin Method, is a transnational cybersect founded in 1988 by the self-styled Taiwanese-Vietnamese Ching Hai, known variously as &quot;Suma Ching Hai&quot; or &quot;Supreme Master Ching Hai&quot;. The sect has been denounced in China as a cult and today propagates its teachings through an online TV station called Supreme Master Television. Ching Hai is the progenitor of the Loving Hut vegan restaurant chain which claims some 200 outlets in 35 countries. The Supreme Master Ching Hai Association (Singapore) is based at the Avari Centre on Geylang Road and runs a Loving Hut restaurant on Joo Chiat Road.

===Sathya Sai Baba movement===
The Sathya Sai Baba movement is a new Hindu religious movement inspired by Indian spiritual guru Sathya Sai Baba (1926–2011) who followers claim to be the avatar of Shiva and Shakti and the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba. During his lifetime, Sai Baba taught the unity of religions and drew crowds with purported materialisations of &quot;vibhuti&quot; and other objects, as well as claims of miraculous healings, resurrections, clairvoyance, bilocation and purported omniscience and omnipotence. The movement&#x27;s history in Singapore goes back to the early 1970s, when a handful of Singaporeans began making trips to India to visit Sai Baba. In 1975, the Sri Satha Sai Society, Singapore was registered, and in 1988, a S$613,500 purchase was made for a 8,000 square foot freehold site at 133 Moulmein Road.

===Shinnyo-en===
Shinnyo-en is a Japanese Buddhist order founded in 1936 by Shinjō Itō and his wife Tomoji in the tradition of the Daigo branch of Shingon Buddhism. The group was formally registered in Singapore in 1994 and claims some 1,800 members who observe rituals and ceremonies at a temple at Jalan Kechot.

===Soka Gakkai===
Soka Gakkai is a Japanese new religious movement based on the teachings of the 13th-century Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren. Founded in Japan in 1930 and affiliated with Nichiren Buddhism, the movement soon made its way to Singapore. The Singapore Soka Association was officially registered in 1972. Its membership was estimated to be about 40,000 people in 25,000 households in 2005. The group has been an active participant at the annual National Day Parade and Chingay events. The association is headquartered in Tampines and runs a Soka Kindergarten there. In October 2020, it broke ground on a new centre in Punggol.

=== Spirit-Medium Cults ===
&quot;[S]pirit-medium cult[s]&quot; are common among the Confucians of Singapore. They often revolve around &quot;male spirit-mediums, called &quot;dang-ki&quot;&quot; who &quot;are subject to involuntary possession by one or more spirits&quot; that the medium ultimately wants to happen.

The &quot;dang-ki&quot; go against Confucian beliefs on the body and mental health by self-harming &quot;in public performances.&quot; &quot;This behavior is accepted...because they are considered instruments of higher powers, cut off from the world of ordinary mortals.&quot;

Some &quot;dang-ki&quot; believe in a spirit who &quot;shakes the Heavens [and] comes from the west riding on a tiger and a dragon, bearing a holy seal&quot;. This being&#x27;s voice is &quot;like thunder&quot; and &quot;makes the &quot;shen&quot; (spirits)...and devils tremble&quot;, it wields a sword that can kill evil spirits, and it can bring salvation.

===Transcendental Meditation===
The Transcendental Meditation movement was founded by Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the mid-1950s. Central to the movement is a specific form of silent, mantra meditation that is practised for 15–20 minutes twice per day and is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, which costs a fee that varies by country. The Singapore TM Centre is run by The Spiritual Regeneration Movement Foundation of Singapore and located at Cendex Centre on Lower Delta Road. It charges S$1,500 per adult and S$2,400 per family for a course that includes personal instruction and follow-up group sessions.

===True Jesus Church===
True Jesus Church is a non-trinitarian restorationist Christian sect that emerged in 1917 in Beijing, China. With teachings influenced by both the early Pentecostal and Adventist movements, the church practices Sabbath keeping, speaking in tongues, foot washing, faith healing and water baptism by full body immersion in natural living waters, with head bowed and face downwards. Members of the True Jesus Church Singapore meet in four worship venues: Adam Road, Sembawang, Serangoon and Telok Kurau.

===Tzu Chi===
Tzu Chi is a new Buddhist movement that was established in 1966 by the Taiwanese &quot;bhikkuni&quot; Master Cheng Yen. Tzu Chi Singapore was founded in 1993 and headquartered at Elias Road in Pasir Ris. The movement runs clinics providing free general practitioner, traditional Chinese medicine and dental services to elderly residents and low-income households in Redhill and Khatib. It also operates the Lakeside Family Medicine Clinic in Jurong West and a day rehabilitation centre in Jurong East. The group&#x27;s education mission runs pre-schools in Yishun and Toa Payoh and a Continuing Education Centre at Elias Road. The group&#x27;s charitable arm provides financial assistance for kidney patients and people with HIV/AIDS.

===World Mission Society Church of God===
The World Mission Society Church of God is a Korean sabbatarian, restorationist Christian new religious movement established in 1964. The church believes that Ahn Sahng-hong, a former Seventh-Day Adventist preacher who died in 1985, is Christ, and refers to his wife Zahng Gil-jah, who is still living, variously as &quot;God the Mother&quot;, &quot;Mother Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;New Jerusalem Mother&quot;, and &quot;Heavenly Mother&quot;. The World Mission Society Church of God Singapore is located at Cheong Chin Nam Road.

==No religious affiliation==
As of 2020, 20% of Singaporeans had no religious affiliation.The proportion of Irreligious people is higher among Chinese people, with one in four Chinese having no religion in the 2020 Census. The Singapore non-religious community itself is very diverse, with many calling themselves atheists, agnostics, free thinkers, humanists, secularists, theists or sceptics. In addition, there some people who decline religious labels but still practice traditional rituals like ancestor worship. The number of non-religious people in Singapore has risen gradually over the decades. Census reports show that those who said they have no religion rose from 13.0% in 1980 to 17.0% in 2010 and to 20.0% in 2020 . In recent years, social gatherings of non-religious people are becoming popular in Singapore. The Singapore Humanism Meetup is a major network of over 400 secular Humanists, freethinkers, atheists, and agnostics. In October 2010, the Humanist Society (Singapore) became the first humanist group to be gazetted as a society.

Below are the ethnic breakdown of Irreligious according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:

==Restrictions==

The constitution provides for religious freedom, subject to restrictions relating to public order, public health, and morality. Publications and public discussions of religious issues are generally censored, along with negative or inflammatory portrayals of religion. The Government does not tolerate speech or actions that it deems could adversely affect racial or religious harmony.

In 2023, the country was scored 3 out of 4 for religious freedom, according to Freedom House based in America.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===

In 1972, the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Singapore on the grounds that its members refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the flag, or swear oaths of allegiance to the state. Singapore has banned all written materials published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, both publishing arms of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. A person who possesses a prohibited publication can be fined up to S$2,000 and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction.

===Unification church===
In 1982, the Minister for Home Affairs dissolved the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, also known as the Unification Church (and colloquially as &quot;Moonies&quot;), for allegedly breaking up families.

===Shincheonji church===
In February 2020, Singapore began a probe into the unregistered local chapter of the Korean new religious movement Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The apocalyptic, messianic sect was known for being the centre of the first COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. The group had fewer than 100 members in Singapore and operated covertly through a front company called Spasie Enrichment. The Ministry of Home Affairs said the group had earlier tried, and failed, to register a company under the name of Heavenly Culture, World Peace and Restoration of Light.

In November 2020, 21 members of the group were arrested for being members of an unlawful society. Five South Korean nationals who held key positions were repatriated and the group&#x27;s front entities were dissolved.

===Islam===
In 2011, Wikileaks published diplomatic cables which attributed controversial comments regarding Islam to Lee Kuan Yew, the Minister Mentor of Singapore&#x27;s government. Wikileaks quoted Lee as having described Islam as a &quot;venomous religion&quot;. Lee later denied making the comments.

The incident followed Lee&#x27;s controversial book release &quot;Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going&quot;. In the book, Lee claimed that Singaporean Muslims faced difficulties in integrating because of their religion, and urged them to &quot;be less strict on Islamic observances&quot; – an assertion that is seemingly contrary to statistics and studies on the levels of social acceptance, tolerance and interracial marriages practised by Singaporean Muslims.

The speakers for broadcasting the Islamic call to prayer were turned inwards to broadcast towards the interior of the mosques as part of a noise abatement campaign in 1974.

<text>Harry Sullivan is a fictional character from the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and is a companion of the Fourth Doctor. Played by Ian Marter, the character appears as a regular during the programme&#x27;s twelfth season in 1974–1975. Harry appeared in 7 stories (27 episodes).

==Character history==
Doctor Sullivan is a commissioned Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, who is attached as medical officer to the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, the military organisation to which the Doctor acts as scientific advisor. He is first mentioned (though not seen) in &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;, when the Brigadier thinks the Third Doctor has gone into a coma. The Brigadier calls for Doctor Sullivan and asks him to come to the Doctor&#x27;s laboratory, but tells him not to bother when Sergeant Benton wakes the Doctor by offering him a cup of coffee. In the next serial, &quot;Robot&quot;, after the Doctor&#x27;s third regeneration, Sullivan is called in to attend him, and ends up travelling aboard the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen) for several subsequent adventures.

Harry is rather old-fashioned and stereotypically English in his attitudes. Somewhat accident-prone, he once claimed he was always trapping his nose in the doors of Portsmouth barracks. He often employs slightly archaic language — for example, referring to Sarah Jane affectionately as &quot;old thing&quot; or &quot;old girl&quot;. He is nonetheless depicted as possessing great bravery and a &quot;can-do&quot; attitude, adapting well to the many strange situations in which he finds himself. He can, however, also be quite clumsy and unsubtle, once leading the Doctor to declare, in a moment of frustration and at the top of his lungs, that &quot;Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!&quot; Nonetheless he is well liked by the Doctor and Sarah Jane, and has a slightly flirtatious relationship with her.

The character was originally devised by the production team as a means of handling any action scenes required in episodes when they had envisioned that the new Doctor would be played by an older actor, as had previously been the case (Sarah Jane even jokingly compares Harry to James Bond at one point). When forty-year-old Tom Baker was cast, however, this was no longer a concern and the decision was taken to write Harry out — something producer Philip Hinchcliffe later admitted was probably a mistake, as Harry was a likeable and popular character who worked well with both of his fellow leads.

Harry&#x27;s last regular appearance is in the season thirteen opener &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot;, which had actually been made at the conclusion of the twelfth production block and held over to start the following season. At the conclusion of this story he chooses to return to London by train rather than by TARDIS with the Doctor and Sarah Jane, who continue their adventures without him. He does, however, reappear three stories later in &quot;The Android Invasion&quot;, both as the original Harry and an android double. This is the character&#x27;s final appearance in the programme.

A later production team gave some consideration to bringing Harry Sullivan back for a guest appearance in the 1983 story &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;, part of the programme&#x27;s twentieth anniversary season. Their first choice was the character of Ian Chesterton, but those plans fell through due to actor William Russell being unavailable. In the end, they decided to use the character of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (played by Nicholas Courtney) instead. Harry is mentioned in the story, however — the Brigadier tells the Fifth Doctor that he was &quot;seconded to NATO&quot; and was last heard of &quot;doing something &#x27;hush-hush&#x27; at Porton Down.&quot;

His photograph appears in the pilot episode of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, hanging on the side of a roof joist in Sarah Jane Smith&#x27;s attic, near a portrait of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and a photograph of Sarah Jane and K-9 Mark III. These were the first uses of classic era imagery in the revived era of the Whoniverse. Also in this episode when Sarah Jane is thinking of names for her son she contemplates choosing the name Harry. In &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, Sarah Jane reveals that Harry continued as a doctor and saved thousands of lives with his vaccines.

In &quot;The Zygon Inversion&quot; Kate Stewart mentions that Sullivan developed a gas known as Z-67, which turns Zygons inside out. The Doctor confiscated the gas and formula to prevent its misuse, referring to the weapon as &quot;the imbecile&#x27;s gas&quot;, referencing his assertion in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; that &quot;Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!&quot;.

Harry is never actually seen in the Tardis console room in the series.

==Appearances in other media==
After leaving the cast of the programme, Ian Marter went on to pen several novelisations of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories for Target Books, writing an original novel, &quot;Harry Sullivan&#x27;s War&quot;, for them in 1985. In &quot;Harry Sullivan&#x27;s War&quot;, the character has become an MI5 operative (supporting the Brigadier&#x27;s comment in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;). Marter was believed to have been planning a sequel at the time of his death from a diabetic coma the following year.

There was a biography of Sarah Jane Smith which stated that she and Harry developed a romantic relationship after her return from travelling with the Doctor. They later parted amicably and were still very fond of each other.

Between 1994 and 2003, the character of Harry appeared in several novels from Virgin Publishing and BBC Books. Some of these stories are set in gaps between televised adventures featuring the character, but in several books he has been seen either earlier or later in life.

In the Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;System Shock&quot; (1995) and the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Millennium Shock&quot; (1999), both by Justin Richards, he is seen during the 1990s as a Deputy Director of MI5. An even later early-21st century Harry has a cameo in the New Adventure &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; by Russell T Davies.

The New Adventure &quot;Blood Heat&quot; (1993) by Jim Mortimore briefly depicts a parallel universe version of Harry serving on a nuclear submarine in a dystopian world ruled by the Silurians, where he manages to save the life of the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion Bernice Summerfield.

In David A. McIntee&#x27;s Past Doctor Adventure &quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot; (1998) Harry is seen still working for the Royal Navy before his secondment to UNIT, which he first encounters in the novel. He also appears in the novel &quot;Wolfsbane&quot; by Jacqueline Rayner, where he briefly aids the currently-amnesic Eighth Doctor in dealing with a plot involving a woman who believes herself to be the reincarnation of Morgan Le Fay in 1936 when the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS accidentally materialises there long enough for Harry to leave, having apparently been drawn off course by its damaged future self. Although the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s amnesia and subsequent regenerations prevent either the Doctor or Harry from recognizing each other, Harry notes that the Doctor has a certain &#x27;Doctorishness&#x27; about him.

In the Big Finish Productions audio drama &quot;UNIT: The Wasting&quot; (2005), Commodore Sullivan (who is working with NATO) is called on by the Brigadier for a favour but does not have a speaking part.

Harry&#x27;s previously unknown younger stepbrother, Will Sullivan (also a medical doctor), appears in the second series of the &quot;Sarah Jane Smith Adventures&quot; (2005–2006) audio plays by Big Finish, voiced by Tom Chadbon. Harry is mentioned by both Will and Sarah Jane, but he is apparently on some secret assignment and neither has seen him for a long time. Will is eventually revealed to be a sleeper agent of a religious cult targeting Sarah Jane, and dies during the course of the series.

Harry appears in the Titan &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Ninth Doctor comic storyline &quot;Official Secrets&quot;, set in the 1970s, where he briefly takes command of UNIT during the Brigadier&#x27;s absence while investigating the mysterious appearance of large monsters, meeting the Ninth Doctor, Rose Tyler and Captain Jack Harkness during the crisis.

===Audio===
In 2017, Big Finish released their first story to include the character of Harry Sullivan. It was narrated by The Monk (Rufus Hound) titled &quot;How to Win Planets and Influence People&quot;&quot;.&quot; In December 2018 the free subscriber short story &quot;Tuesday&quot; by Tony Jones also featured Harry Sullivan and was narrated by Stephen Critchlow.

In 2019, Big Finish released their third story featuring the character of Harry Sullivan narrated by Leela (Louise Jameson) titled &quot;#HarrySullivan&quot;.

The Big Finish audio drama, &quot;UNIT: Nemesis&quot;, released in November 2021, features Harry Sullivan having been pulled out of time into the 21st century to assist the modern-day UNIT. Sullivan is portrayed by Christopher Naylor in this series.

==Other mentions==
A vision of Harry is seen along with every other companion (aside from Leela) on the scanner screen in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;. Harry is also seen calling out to the Doctor just before his regeneration in &quot;Logopolis&quot;. He is also mentioned in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, with Sarah recounting his successful medical career, revealing &quot;He did such good work with vaccines. He saved thousands of lives&quot;. In &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; issue 512, discussing his 2017 episode &quot;Knock Knock&#x27;, writer Mike Bartlett revealed that the character of Harry in his episode was intended to be the grandson of Harry Sullivan (who, according to this episode, had gone &quot;grey-packing&quot; with his boyfriend to the Great Wall of China where he was arrested for trying to steal a piece).
Harry Sullivan is again with Sarah Jane and the Fourth Doctor in “Scratchman,” a novel written and later narrated by Tom Baker.

<doc id="922803" wikidata="Q1067357" url="?curid=922803" title="The Dark Elf Trilogy">
<text>The Dark Elf Trilogy is a prequel to the &quot;Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot; by R. A. Salvatore. Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, a drow, or dark elf, was originally written as a supporting character in the &quot;Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot; to Wulfgar the barbarian. However, the author soon realized how popular the character was, and Drizzt became the main character. The final book &quot;Sojourn&quot; made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Works included==
The trilogy consists of:
# Homeland (1990) — &quot;Homeland&quot; follows the story of Drizzt from around the time and circumstances of his birth and his upbringing amongst the drow (dark elves). The book takes the reader into Menzoberranzan, the drow home city. From here, the reader follows Drizzt on his quest to follow his principles in a land where such feelings are threatened by all his family including his mother Matron Malice.
# Exile (1990) — &quot;Exile&quot; tells the story of Drizzt outside of the drow cities in the open wilderness of the Underdark. For the ten years following his abandoning his house, he is left with no one but his faithful Guenhwyvar, a magical panther he had acquired in &quot;Homeland&quot;. Drizzt is also met with great dangers that he meets with the business ends of his scimitars. Struggling with conflicting emotions, which involve his failure in Menzoberranzan and a deep grief for his father and friend Zaknafein, he makes his way to the surface to face newer dangers.
# Sojourn (1991) — &quot;Sojourn&quot; is the story of Drizzt coming to the surface of the world and facing adversity due to the infamy of his kin. It follows him trying to find his place among the humans that live between the city of Sundabar and Citadel Adbar. He is rejected, and hunted, before meeting and living with an elderly blind man known as Montolio DeBrouchee. Montolio teaches Drizzt what it means to become a ranger and together they defend Mooshie&#x27;s home against a raid by local orcs. Drizzt ultimately leaves the Sundabar area and makes his way to Icewind Dale where he befriends Catti-brie and Bruenor Battlehammer and finds a place to call home.

==Characters==
* Roddy McGristle is a human bounty hunter, and has two dogs that he uses to hunt and wields an axe named &quot;Bleeder.&quot; He seeks out the bounty on Drizzt, who kills one of the dogs and injures the other. Roddy&#x27;s ear is lost and face is scarred when he chops down a tree with his axe – he persists in telling everyone that Drizzt injured him. He begins to follow any rumors based upon Drizzt in order to get revenge upon him, using the deaths of the Thistledowns as an excuse to get men to help. In actuality he cares little for the Thistledowns and later doesn&#x27;t even care for the bounty, partly because it was determined that Drizzt was not involved in their murder. Making the grudge personal, he eventually tracks Drizzt down to Icewind Dale, but Roddy is easily defeated, though Drizzt could not bring himself to end the man&#x27;s life. He is then driven from the mountain by Bruenor and is never heard from again.
* Clacker is a pech, who is transformed into a Hook Horror by a human wizard. Under the effects of this spell, he forgets his name, much of his past, and eventually his mind begins to transform into that of a mindless beast. He meets Drizzt and Belwar Dissengulp as they journey through the Underdark. The three sought the wizard that cast the spell on Clacker; however, Clacker unwillingly killed him when a comment from the wizard drove him into a primal rage from his Hook Horror instincts. He eventually has a moment of resurgence, where he becomes more in-tune with the earth than a regular pech. He uses his abilities to save his friends, and then asks them to kill him before he completely turns. He is killed by Zaknafein, and his body, having returned to its true form, is placed into a pool of acid.
* Belwar Dissengulp is a former burrow-warden of the svirfneblin, another humanoid race in the Underdark. Ten years prior to the events of Exile, Drizzt was part of a raiding party of Menzoberranzan who attacked a mining party of svirfneblin, led by Belwar. Again Drizzt&#x27;s merciful nature showed, and he convinced his group to let Belwar live (using the excuse that he could serve as a warning to the svirfneblin against venturing so close to Menzoberranzan). However, Drizzt&#x27;s brother, Dinin, decided to sever both his hands as an example. 10 years pending Drizzt&#x27;s self-imposed exile, he ventured into the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, where he requested to speak with Belwar, whose hands had been replaced with a magical hammer and pickaxe. The former burrow-warden decided to take Drizzt into his home and keep responsibility for him, knowing that he owed his life to him. When Drizzt was forced to leave the city (the city fearing the drow hunting him), Belwar decided to join him in his adventures through the Underdark, and only left when Drizzt told of his intentions to go to the surface.
* Kellindil A wood elf, and part of Dove Falconhand&#x27;s group, he meets Drizzt and attacks him assuming him the enemy, though pending the Drow&#x27;s retreat and lack of violence toward him he suspects Drizzt&#x27;s good intentions. He then keeps an eye on Drizzt during the time he spent with Mooshie. He and his elves arrive in time to offer some help in the attack from King Graul and his orcs. He finds Roddy and takes him captive intending to question him. However Roddy is freed and kills him.
* Montolio DeBrouchee is an aging Human ranger, nicknamed &#x27;Mooshie.&#x27; Though he was blinded in a battle against a dragon, he learned to utilize his other senses, as well as his connection with nature, to make up for his disability. He is the one who discovered Drizzt&#x27;s true calling as a Ranger and taught him how to embrace it and make use of his abilities. Soon before Mooshie&#x27;s death, he coerced a promise from Drizzt to try to find a place in the world instead of lingering in the forest alone; as Mooshie died in his sleep, Drizzt honored his lost friend by keeping his promise.

==Comics==
The books have been adapted into comic book form by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing. The artist for the comic series Tim Seeley with Andrew Dabb as the writer under the supervision of R.A. Salvatore. The adaption of &quot;Homeland&quot;, volume 1, received a positive review from George Galuschak of &quot;Kliatt&quot; magazine, who said, &quot;I am not a big sword &amp; sorcery buff, but I enjoyed this graphic novel. The plot is easy to follow: you don&#x27;t need a &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; encyclopedia at your side to understand what&#x27;s going on.&quot; The trade paperback &quot;Sojourn&quot;, volume 3 of the Dark Elf ranked 19 in the August 2006 Graphic Novels sales with an estimated sale quantity of 3,465.

==Reception==
&quot;Homeland&quot; received a positive review from critic Cindy Speer from &quot;SF Site&quot;. She stated the novel was an impressive start to the characterisation of Drizzt.

On March 26, 1991 &quot;Sojourn&quot; debuted at 13 of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Ian Strelec awarded the final book of the trilogy, &quot;Sojourn&quot; with a B+ rating. He stated he found the book short and although not incredible, it was an important component of the Drizzt mythos.

<doc id="922804" wikidata="Q2499911" url="?curid=922804" title="Edging (sexual practice)">
<text>Edging, sometimes also referred to as gooning or surfing, is a sexual technique whereby an orgasm is controlled (that is, delayed or prevented). It is practiced alone or with a partner and involves the maintenance of a high level of sexual arousal for an extended period without reaching climax. Orgasm control involves either sex partner being in control of the other partner&#x27;s orgasm, or a person delaying their own orgasm during sexual activity with a partner or through masturbation. Any method of sexual stimulation can be used to experience controlled orgasm. 

When the controlled orgasm is achieved, the physical sensations are greater as compared to conventional orgasm. Orgasm control has also been referred to as &quot;slow masturbation&quot; and &quot;extended massive orgasm&quot;. When practiced by males, direct sexual stimulation without the refractory period after orgasm is sometimes possible.

Edging should not be confused with edgeplay, which refers to a set of sexual practices distinct from edging. It should also not be confused with premature ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, or the inability to orgasm, all of which describe involuntary medical conditions.

The terms &quot;edging&quot; and &quot;gooning&quot; have been adopted by Generation Z and older Gen Alpha as brain rot terminology, gaining popularity on TikTok. In internet slang, &quot;gooner&quot; is often used to refer to pleasure-seekers and porn performers, as well as extreme excitement or obsession in non-sexual contexts.

== In partnered sex ==

During intercourse or other forms of sexual stimulation with a partner, one person stimulates the other(s) and reduces the level of stimulation when approaching orgasm. Erotic sexual denial occurs when the partner who is in control of the other partner&#x27;s orgasm prolongs the orgasm to allow for an increased level of sexual tension. When a partner eventually provides enough stimulation to achieve an orgasm, it may be stronger than usual due to increased tension and arousal that builds up during the extended stimulation. An example of the use of orgasm control in partnered sex can be seen in BDSM; the partner whose orgasm is being controlled (sometimes referred to as the submissive partner) can be tied up. (the activity is sometimes called tie and tease; if orgasm is denied, it is then known as tease and denial).

== In masturbation ==

When practicing alone in masturbation, orgasm control can heighten sexual pleasure. For a woman, the practitioner can enjoy direct sexual stimulation for longer periods, as well as increasing frequency and intensity. For a man, the speed of masturbation may vary to navigate right to the edge of ejaculation. With orgasm control, a male can experience a more intense orgasm, as well as a larger volume of semen expelled during his ejaculation. One technique, commonly referred to as &#x27;edging&#x27;, involves masturbating up until the moment before reaching the plateau phase just before orgasm occurs, and then stopping suddenly before experiencing a climax. Repeating this technique many times during a single masturbation session may result in a stronger, more intense orgasm.

The name &#x27;Kota-giri&#x27; itself means &#x27;mountains of the kotas&#x27;. Kotagiri was known in the past as &#x27;Kota-keri&#x27; or &#x27;Kota-gherry&#x27;, the &#x27;street of Kotas&#x27;. The town has developed around numerous knolls and valleys. It is one of the largest hill stations in the Nilgiri Mountains. Located at an average elevation of 1,950 m (6,400 ft), Kotagiri is quietly tucked away in the Nilgiris and used to be one of the summer resorts of Madras Presidency. The town was discovered in the year 1819 by John Sullivan when he came to a village called Dhimbatty to the north of Kotagiri. Kotagiri enjoys the third coldest climate next to Ooty and Kodaikanal in South India.

<text>Antonio Scandello (January 17, 1517 – January 18, 1580) was an Italian composer, born in Bergamo. He worked as musician at the court of the Electors of Saxony in Dresden. In 1549 he became court-bandmaster, and in 1568 Kapellmeister succeeding Mattheus Le Maistre. His music combines elements of the Italian Renaissance with German musical traditions.

Scandello composed a memorial mass for the Saxon Elector Maurice (Missa super Epithaphum Mauritii), who had been wounded to death at the battle of Sievershausen. The mass is based on a motet on the Latin epitaph of Maurice by the headmaster Georg Fabricius of the Misnian princely school. It was conducted at the burial of the Elector in the Freiberg minster in 1562.

Scandella died in 1580 in Dresden.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Van der Stoel attended the Gymnasium Leiden from June 1937 until June 1943, and applied at the Leiden University in June 1943 majoring in Law and obtaining a Bachelor of Laws degree in December 1945 before graduating with a Master of Laws degree in July 1947. Van der Stoel continued to study at the Leiden University for a postgraduate education in Sociology and worked as a student researcher before obtaining a Bachelor of Social Science degree June 1947 and a Master of Social Science degree in July 1953. Van der Stoel worked as a researcher for the Wiardi Beckman Foundation, the scientific bureau of the Partij van de Arbeid (PvdA, the Dutch labour party), from August 1953 until April 1958 and as a political consultant for the Labour Party from April 1958 until July 1965.

Van der Stoel was elected as a Member of the Senate following the Senate election of 1960, serving from 27 September 1960 until 5 June 1963. That year, he became international secretary for the PvdA .

===Politics===
From 1973 to 1977 and 1981 to 1982 he was the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the 1973 October War when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel, van der Stoel took a highly pro-Israeli position and was regarded as the most pro-Israeli foreign minister in Europe. To punish the Dutch for their pro-Israel stance, the Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia placed a total oil embargo on shipping oil to the Netherlands, which was one of the nations most affected by the 1973 &quot;oil shock&quot;. In 1977, during his visit to communist Czechoslovakia, he met with philosopher and dissident Jan Patočka, and they discussed Charter 77 and human rights in Czechoslovakia. This provoked harsh criticism by the Czechoslovak authorities and president Gustáv Husák cancelled scheduled meeting with van der Stoel.

In 2001, following his intervention as High Commissioner in the ongoing problem of equitable access to higher education by members of the Albanian ethnic group in the Republic of Macedonia, he became the founding President of the International Foundation for the South East European University, raising some 35m Euros from the international community. He later served as President of the University Board until 2004. He was awarded the University&#x27;s first honorary Doctorate and the University named its Library and its Research Institute in his honour.

Van der Stoel was a member of the Advisory Board of the European Association of History Educators (EUROCLIO).

<text>WZPL (99.5 FM) is a radio station licensed to Greenfield, Indiana, and serving the Indianapolis metropolitan area. The station airs a contemporary hit radio format. WZPL is owned by Cumulus Media. Its studios are located on North Shadeland Avenue on the city&#x27;s east side, with its transmitter north of the Indianapolis World Sports Park on the east side of Indianapolis.

==History==
The station signed on as WSMJ on June 1, 1962, and remained as such until the spring of 1979 when WSMJ was sold to Heftel Broadcasting. They changed to a disco music format and adopted the call sign WIKS-FM, &quot;Rock Kiss 99 FM&quot;, on April 14, 1979. Later, a contemporary hit radio format was adopted which, aside from a brief experiment playing classic rock in 1989, has continued to this day. The station was added to both Mediabase and Nielsen BDS Top 40/CHR reporting panels in November 2012.

The station is anchored by The Smiley Morning Show, hosted by Dave Smiley.

In the early 2000s, the station was known as &quot;Z 99-5.&quot;

On February 13, 2019, Cumulus Media and Entercom announced an agreement in which WZPL, WNTR, and WXNT would be swapped to Cumulus in exchange for WNSH (now WXBK) in New York City and WHLL and WMAS-FM in Springfield, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the deal, Cumulus began operating WZPL under a local marketing agreement on March 1, 2019. The swap was completed on May 9, 2019.

==HD radio==
In 2005, WZPL became one of the first Indianapolis-area radio stations to broadcast their signal in HD Radio. In 2006, they introduced a stream of &quot;All Comedy Radio&quot;, a 24-hour comedy station, also known as &quot;The Laugh Button,&quot; on their alternate HD 2 digital channel, and HD 3 as a simulcast of WXNT 1430 AM, CBS Sports Radio. Following the sale of Radio Disney affiliate WRDZ-FM (now hip-hop formatted WZRL) to iHeartMedia (after the network started shuttering FM affiliates in the mid 2010s), WZPL had picked up the Radio Disney format for a year on the HD2 channel, until Entercom&#x27;s affiliation with Disney expired.

<doc id="922838" wikidata="Q3142448" url="?curid=922838" title="Epithets in Homer">
<text>A characteristic of Homer&#x27;s style is the use of epithets, as in &quot;rosy-fingered&quot; Dawn or &quot;swift-footed&quot; Achilles. Epithets are used because of the constraints of the dactylic hexameter (i.e., it is convenient to have a stockpile of metrically fitting phrases to add to a name) and because of the oral transmission of the poems; they are mnemonic aids to the singer and the audience alike.

Formulae in epic poetry from various Indo-European traditions may be traced to a common tradition. For example, the phrase for &quot;everlasting glory&quot; or &quot;undying fame&quot; can be found in the Homeric Greek as / and Vedic Sanskrit as / . These two phrases were, in terms of historical linguistics, equivalent in phonology, accentuation, and quantity (syllable length). In other words, they descend from a fragment of poetic diction (reconstructable as Proto-Indo-European ) which was handed down in parallel over many centuries, in continually diverging forms, by generations of singers whose ultimate ancestors shared an archetypal repertoire of poetic formulae and narrative themes.

In contrast to the more general term &#x27;epithet&#x27; (), which is used in poetic contexts, for the ancient Greek religion, the epiclesis ( (; literally &#x27;calling upon&#x27;)) was used as the surname that was associated with a deity during religious invocations.

Epithets alter the meaning of each noun to which they are attached. They specify the existential nature of a noun; that is to say, Achilles is not called &quot;swift-footed&quot; only when he runs; it is a marker of a quality that does not change. Special epithets, such as patronymics, are used exclusively for particular subjects and distinguish them from others, while generic epithets are used of many subjects and speak less to their individual characters. In these examples, the epithet can be contradictory to the present state of the subject: in &quot;Odyssey&quot; VI.74, for instance, Nausicaa takes her &quot;radiant clothing&quot;, , to be washed; since it is dirty, it is unlikely to be radiant.

== List ==

<doc id="922839" wikidata="Q7745774" url="?curid=922839" title="The Last Full Measure (novel)">
<text>The Last Full Measure ( (), ()) is a novel by American author Jeffrey Shaara, published on May 2, 2000, by Ballantine Books. It is the sequel to &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; and &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. Together, the three novels complete an American Civil War trilogy relating events from 1858 to 1865.

==History==
The novel, along with the second part of the trilogy, &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (1996) were written by Shaara after the death of his father, Michael Shaara, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. Employing the same style as the previous two books in the series, &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; is written as a first-person narrative from various officers of the Union and Confederate Armies as they regroup after Gettysburg and move into the final two years of the war. Characters featured include General Robert E. Lee, newly promoted Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain, and Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant.

The novel&#x27;s title comes from a line in the Gettysburg Address: &quot;It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.&quot;

Like the first two novels of the trilogy, &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; was planned to be made into a feature film by Ted Turner. However, &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; performed so poorly at the box office that the project was abandoned due to lack of interest and funding.

<doc id="922840" wikidata="Q3740798" url="?curid=922840" title="Rectovaginal fistula">
<text>A rectovaginal fistula is a medical condition where there is a fistula or abnormal connection between the rectum and the vagina.

Rectovaginal fistulae may be extremely debilitating. If the opening between the rectum and vagina is wide it will allow both flatulence and feces to escape through the vagina, leading to fecal incontinence. There is an association with recurrent urinary and vaginal infections. The fistula may also connect the rectum and urethra, which is called recto-urethral fistula. Either conditions can lead to labial fusion. This type of fistula can cause pediatricians to misdiagnose imperforate anus. The severity of the symptoms will depend on the size of fistula. Most often, it appears after about one week or so after childbirth.

==Causes==
Rectovaginal fistulas are often the result of trauma during childbirth (in which case it is known as obstetric fistula), with increased risk associated with significant lacerations or interventions are used such as episiotomy or operative (forceps/vacuum extraction) deliveries or in situations where there is inadequate health care, such as in some developing countries. Rectovaginal fistula is said to be known as the leading cause in maternal death in developing countries. Risk factors include prolonged labour, difficult instrumental delivery and paramedian episiotomy. Rates in Eritrea are estimated as high as 350 per 100,000 vaginal births. Fistulas can also develop as a result of physical trauma to either the vagina or anus, including from rape. Women with rectovaginal fistulae are often stigmatized in developing countries, and become outcasts.

Rectovaginal fistula can also be a symptom of various diseases, including infection by lymphogranuloma venereum, or the unintended result of surgery, such as episiotomy or sex reassignment surgery. They may present as a complication of vaginal surgery, including vaginal hysterectomy. They are a recognized presentation of rectal carcinoma or rarely diverticular disease of the bowel or Crohn&#x27;s disease. They are seen rarely after radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer.

==Treatment==
After diagnosing rectovaginal fistula, it is best to wait for around three months to allow the inflammation to subside. For low fistulae, a vaginal approach is best, while an abdominal repair would be necessary for a high fistula at the posterior fornix.A circular incision is made around the fistula and vagina is separated from the underlying rectum with a sharp circumferential dissection. The entire fistulous tract, along with a small rim of rectal mucosa is incised. The rectal wall is then closed extramucosally.

Most rectovaginal fistulas will need surgery to fix. Medications such as antibiotics and Infliximab may be prescribed to help close the rectovaginal fistula or prepare for surgery.

<text>Johan &quot;Jan&quot; van Galen (1604 – 23 March 1653) was a Commodore of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands. he participated in the First Anglo-Dutch War.

==Biography==
Johan van Galen was born in Essen. He fought in the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Spain, becoming a captain in 1630 and a regular captain in 1635, mostly fighting the Dunkirkers. In 1639, he fought in the Battle of the Downs under the command of Joris van Cats.
In 1645, as a Rear-Admiral, Van Galen was part of Vice-Admiral Witte de With&#x27;s convoy breaking the blockade of The Sound by Denmark. Both men were very hot-tempered and proud; emotions ran so high that, at one point, in anger, Van Galen lowered his command flag and trampled it with his feet. De With put him in chains and delivered him to the capital of the adversary, Copenhagen. The embarrassed Danish court released Van Galen after an intervention by the French envoy.

A peculiarity of Van Galen is that he never served in the navy proper, an institution he disliked, but was employed by the Amsterdam Direction Chamber, a private organisation supporting the official navy. After the Republic had made peace with Spain in 1648, Van Galen was sent out three times, with Spanish assistance, to fight the corsairs of the Barbary Coast. In 1649, he was badly wounded when a gang of Spanish criminals intercepted him when he was returning in a sloop with prize money.
Van Galen retired late in 1650, but when the First Anglo-Dutch War between the Republic and the Commonwealth of England broke out, he was asked by the States-General, on 3 July 1652, to assume command of a Dutch fleet in the Mediterranean, as a Commodore and replacing Commandeur Joris van Cats. He departed on 24 July, reaching Livorno on 22 August. He was mortally wounded during the Battle of Leghorn, where his fleet destroyed part of the English Mediterranean Fleet. A cannonball smashed his right lower leg; it was amputated below-deck and afterwards, Van Galen continued to direct the battle. He died from wound fever ten days later in Livorno on 13 March 1653. Cornelis Tromp was then a young captain under his command.
Van Galen was given a state burial in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam and in 1656, a marble grave memorial was erected on which this poem is inscribed:

<doc id="922843" wikidata="Q207020" url="?curid=922843" title="Central European Summer Time">
<text>Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+02:00), sometimes referred to as Central European Daylight Time (CEDT), is the standard clock time observed during the period of summer daylight-saving in those European countries which observe Central European Time (CET; UTC+01:00) during the other part of the year. It corresponds to UTC+02:00, which makes it the same as Eastern European Time, Central Africa Time, South African Standard Time, Egypt Standard Time and Kaliningrad Time in Russia.

==Names==
Other names which have been applied to Central European Summer Time are Middle European Summer Time (MEST), Central European Daylight Saving Time (CEDT), and Bravo Time (after the second letter of the NATO phonetic alphabet). 

==Period of observation==
Since 1996, European Summer Time has been observed between 01:00 UTC (02:00 CET and 03:00 CEST) on the last Sunday of March, and 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday of October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.

There were proposals to abandon summer time in Europe from 2021, possibly by moving winter time up by an hour and keeping that time through the year.

==Usage==
The following countries and territories regularly use Central European Summer Time:
* Albania, since 1974
* Andorra, since 1985
* Austria, since 1980
* Belgium, since 1980
* Bosnia and Herzegovina, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia
* Croatia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia
* Czech Republic, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia
* Denmark (metropolitan), since 1980
* France (metropolitan), since 1976
* Germany, since 1980
* Gibraltar, since 1982
* Hungary, since 1980
* Italy, since 1968
* Kosovo, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia
* Liechtenstein, since 1981
* Luxembourg, since 1981
* Malta, since 1974
* Monaco, since 1976
* Montenegro, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia
* Netherlands, since 1977
* North Macedonia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia
* Norway, since 1980
* Poland, since 1977
* San Marino, since 1966
* Serbia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia
* Slovakia, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia
* Slovenia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia
* Spain, since 1974 (except Canary Islands, which instead apply Western European Summer Time)
* Sweden, since 1980
* Switzerland, since 1981
* Vatican City, since 1966

The following countries have also used Central European Summer Time in the past:
* Libya, 1951–1959, 1982–1989, 1996–1997, 2012–2013
* Lithuania, 1998–1999
* Portugal, 1993–1995

<text>The National Monument (, abbreviated Monas) is a 132 m (433 ft) obelisk in the centre of Merdeka Square, Central Jakarta. It is the national monument of the Republic of Indonesia, built to commemorate the struggle for Indonesian independence. This monument is crowned with a flame covered in gold leaf which symbolizes the burning spirit of struggle of the Indonesian people.

Construction began in 1961 under the direction of President Sukarno, and the monument was opened to the public in 1975. The monument and the museum are open daily from 08:00 to 16:00 Western Indonesia Time (UTC+7) throughout the week except for Mondays when the monument is closed. Since April 2016, the monument is also open during night time, from 19:00 to 22:00 on Tuesdays to Fridays, and from 19:00 to 00:00 on Saturdays and Sundays.

==Background==

After the Indonesian government returned to Jakarta from Yogyakarta in 1950 following the Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence, President Sukarno began to contemplate the construction of a national monument comparable to the Eiffel Tower on the square in front of the Presidential Palace.

On 17 August 1954, a National Monument Committee was established and a design competition was held in 1955. This attracted 51 entries, but only one design, by Friedrich Silaban, met any of the criteria determined by the committee, which included reflecting the character of Indonesia in a building capable of lasting for centuries. A repeat competition was held in 1960, but once again, none of the 136 entries met the criteria.

The chairman of the jury team then asked Silaban to show his design to Sukarno. However, Sukarno did not like the design as he wanted the monument to be in the form of a linga and yoni. Silaban was asked to design such a monument, but his design was for a monument so large that it would have been unaffordable given the economic conditions at the time.

Silaban refused to design a smaller monument, suggesting that construction be delayed until the Indonesian economy improved. Sukarno then asked the architect R.M. Soedarsono to continue with the design. Soedarsono incorporated the numbers 17, 8 and 45, representing the 17 August 1945 Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, in the dimensions of the monument.

==Construction==

The construction of Monas proceeded in three stages. The first period, from 1961/1962–1964/1965 began with the official start of construction on 17 August 1961 with Sukarno ceremonially driving in the first concrete pile.

A total of 284 piles were used for the foundation block. A further 360 piles were driven in for the museum foundations, with work being completed in March 1962. The walls of the museum in the base were completed by October. Construction of the obelisk then commenced and was finished in August 1963. Work in the second stage, from 1966 to 1968, was delayed by shortages of funding and the aftermath of the 30 September Movement coup attempt.

In the final phase, from 1969 to 1976, the dioramas for the historical museum were added. Problems remained once construction was complete, and work was needed to solve problems with water leaking into the museum. Monas was officially opened to the public on 12 July 1975. The location of Monas is known as Merdeka Square.

==Description==
===Design===

The towering monument encapsulates the philosophy of Lingga and Yoni. Lingga resembles an &quot;alu&quot; rice pestle and Yoni resembles a &quot;lesung&quot; rice mortar, two important traditional Indonesian tools. Lingga and Yoni also symbolize harmony, balance, fertility and eternal life with the lingga phallic symbol, representing masculinity, positive elements, and daytime and the Yoni the female organs symbol, representing femininity, negative elements, and night.

It also resembles the bloom of the famous &quot;Amorphophallus titanum&quot;, native to Indonesia. Indeed, fiberglass &quot;Amorphophallus&quot; and &quot;Rafflesia&quot; sculptures were once installed around the monument.

The monument consists of a 117.7m obelisk on a 45m square platform at a height of 17m, the goblet yard. The obelisk itself is clad with Italian marble.

The northern pond measuring 25×25 m was designed to cool water for the air conditioning system of Monas as well as to enhance the beauty of the surrounding area. To the north, there is a statue of Indonesia national hero Prince Diponegoro by Italian sculptor Cobertaldo.

===Reliefs of Indonesian history===

In the outer yard surrounding Monas there are reliefs of Indonesian history. The story begins in the northeastern corner and describes events during eras such as the Singhasari and Majapahit empires. The reliefs extend along the four walls showing the European colonialization of the Indonesian archipelago, various popular local uprisings, modern Indonesian organizations in the early 20th century, the Japanese occupation in World War II, the Proclamation of Independence, and post-independence developments. The reliefs were made from molded cement although several of the statues are damaged and have decayed due to weathering.

===The National History Museum===
The Indonesian National History Museum has a display of dioramas in the large marble-lined hall below Monas. There are a total of 51 dioramas around the walls and in the centre of the hall.

The dioramas begin in the northeastern corner, displaying the scenes from Indonesian history from the beginning during the earliest days of Prehistoric Indonesia, the construction of Borobudur, the Sriwijaya and Majapahit eras, followed with events from the period of European colonization and uprisings against Dutch East Indies Company and Dutch East Indies rule.

The dioramas continue well into the 20th century showing the Japanese occupation, the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945, the struggle for independence of Indonesian revolution, and on to events during the New Order era of Suharto&#x27;s regime.

===The Hall of Independence===

The Hall of Independence () is situated inside the goblet or &quot;cup&quot; part of Monas (). The hall, which contains various symbols of independence, can be reached through spiral stairs at the north and south doors. The original text of the Proclamation of Independence is stored in a glass case inside the bronze door. On the west side of the inner wall. Mechanized bronze doors weigh 4 tons and are coated with gold leaf adorned with the image of a &quot;Wijaya Kusuma&quot; flower, symbolizing eternity, and a lotus flower, symbolizing purity. The doors, known as &quot;Gerbang Kemerdekaan&quot; or the Gate of Independence, open slowly while the nationalist &quot;Padamu Negeri&quot; song plays followed by a recording of Sukarno reading the text of the Proclamation. On the southern wall there is a large bronze gold-coated statue of the coat of arms of Indonesia weighing 3.5 tons. On the eastern side is the text of the proclamation in bronze lettering. Originally the eastern side displayed the most sacred Indonesian flag, &quot;Sang Saka Merah Putih&quot;, originally raised on 17 August 1945. However, because it is fragile and in poor condition it is no longer displayed. The wall on the northern side displays a map of the Indonesian archipelago coated in gold.

There is a middle platform on top of the &quot;cawan&quot; (goblet) which provides visitors with views from a height of 17 metres. This middle platform is accessible through the elevator on the way down from the main observation deck (the lift stops on the way down at the &quot;cawan&quot; to allow visitors to exit) or through stairs from below.

===The Observation Deck and Flame of Independence===

A lift on the southern side carries visitors to the viewing platform at a height of 115 metres above ground level. The capacity of the elevator is about 11 people. The top platform can accommodate about 50 people. There is also a staircase for use in emergencies. The total height of the monument is 132 metres. The distance from the viewing platform to the tip of the flame is 17 metres. The ticket to observation deck is Rp.10,000 (adults, 2016).

Monas is topped by a 14.5 ton bronze Flame of Independence containing the lift engine. The base of the flame, in the shape of a goblet, is 3 metres high. The bronze flame structure measures 14 metres in height and 6 metres in diameter, It consists of 77 sections. Originally the bronze flame structure was covered with 35 kg of gold leaf. For the 50th anniversary of Indonesian independence in 1995, the gold leaf was reapplied and increased to 50 kg of gold.

==Visitation==
The observation desk and other facilities are open daily from 08.00 to 15.00 daily (except for Mondays; as of August 2022). The entrance to Monas is located around 100 meters from the northern side of the monument. Visitors must enter by steps leading to a tunnel which leads back towards the base of the Monas. There is a ticket office (Rp 5,000 for adults, Rp 2,000 for children, 2016) at the end of the tunnel to provide tickets that allows access to the National History Museum, diorama displays, as well as several other parts of the area.To access the observation deck, a different ticket must be bought for RP10,000 or adults (2016) and may be purchased at a second booth after passing through the hall that displays dioramas.

<doc id="922851" wikidata="Q405814" url="?curid=922851" title="Ship of Fools (painting)">
<text>Ship of Fools (painted c. 1490–1500) is a painting by the Early Netherlandish artist Hieronymus Bosch, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. Camille Benoit donated it in 1918. The Louvre restored it in 2015. The surviving painting is a fragment of a triptych that was cut into several parts. This piece, originally part of a larger body of work relating to the seven deadly sins, depicts the sin of gluttony. &quot;The Ship of Fools&quot; was painted on one of the wings of the altarpiece, and is about two-thirds of its original length. The bottom third of the panel belongs to Yale University Art Gallery and is exhibited under the title &quot;Allegory of Gluttony&quot;. The other wing, which has more or less retained its full length, is the &quot;Death and the Miser&quot;, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. The two panels together would have represented the two extremes of prodigality and miserliness, condemning and caricaturing both. &quot;The Wayfarer&quot; (Rotterdam) was painted on the right panel rear of the triptych. The central panel, if it existed, is unknown.

==Dating/provenance==

Dendrochronological study has dated the wood to 1491, and it is tempting to see the painting as a response to Sebastian Brant&#x27;s &quot;Das Narrenschiff&quot; or even the illustrations of the first edition of 1493. Another possible source for the ship allegory is the 14th-century &quot;Le Pèlerinage de l&#x27;Âme&quot; by Guillaume de Deguileville, which was printed in Dutch in 1486 (shortly after William Caxton printed it as &quot;The Pylgremage of the Sowle&quot; in 1483).

A &quot;&quot;, also in the Louvre, appears to be a later copy.

Dendrochronological studies by Peter Klein have radically altered the provenance of some paintings, for instance the Escorial &quot;Crowning with Thorns&quot; panel can only have been painted after 1525 and so is not a Bosch original. The same goes for the Rotterdam &quot;Marriage feast at Cana&quot; panel which can only have been painted after 1553. It has also become clear that the Rotterdam Pedlar tondo, the Paris &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; panel and the Washington &quot;Death of a Miser&quot; panel have been painted on wood from the same tree.

The two to eight years between the felling of the tree and its use as a painting substrate allows &quot;The Ship of Fools&quot; to be a direct satire of a frontispiece of Sebastian Brant&#x27;s book.

<doc id="922859" wikidata="Q1194023" url="?curid=922859" title="Yokohama DeNA BayStars">
<text>The are a professional baseball team in the Japanese Central League. Their home field is Yokohama Stadium, located in central Yokohama. The team has been known by several names since becoming a professional team in 1950. It adopted its current name in 2011, when the club was purchased by software company DeNA.

==History==

===Origin (1930s–1949)===
The team began as the Taiyo Fishing Company, an amateur team currently affiliated with the Maruha Corporation (presently Maruha Nichiro). The team began to appear in national tournaments in the 1950s, and won the National Sports Festival in 1948, giving it national recognition. In the 1949 off-season, the Japanese professional baseball league removed many players from the Taiyo amateur team recruited to join the professional leagues. The owner of the Taiyo company decided to join the newly expanded Central League, which was established in 1950. The team&#x27;s first professional incarnation was as the Maruha Team. The franchise was based in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi.

===Taiyo Whales (1950–1952)===
The team name was changed to the shortly after the start of the 1950 season. The Whales received several veteran players from the Yomiuri Giants to compensate for their lack of players, but ended up in the bottom half of the standings each year.

In 1951, there was talk of merging with the Hiroshima Carp, which had experienced serious financial problems but the merging never occurred due to massive protests from Hiroshima citizens.

===Taiyo Shochiku Robins (1953) and Yo-Sho Robins (1954)===
In 1952, it was decided that teams ending the season with a winning percentage below .300 would be disbanded or merged with other teams. The Shochiku Robins fell into this category, and were merged with the Taiyo Whales to become the in January, 1953. However, the team&#x27;s re-organization was not completed in time for the 1953 season, and the team ended up continuing its offices in both Shimonoseki and Kyoto. Home games took place in Osaka for geographical reasons, and the team&#x27;s finances were managed by both the Taiyo and Shochiku companies until the franchise was officially transferred to Osaka in 1954, to become the .

The Shochiku Robins had won the 1950 Central League championship before being merged.

===Taiyo Whales (1955–1977)===
The Shochiku company discontinued its support in December, 1954, and the team name returned to the Taiyo Whales. The franchise moved to Kawasaki, Kanagawa, and obtained an exclusive home field, (Kawasaki Stadium), but ended up in last place six years in a row from 1954–1959.

In 1960, the team recruited Osamu Mihara, who had been manager of the Nishitetsu Lions the previous year. Mihara led the team to its first pennant in 1960, and swept the Daimai Orions in the 1960 Japan Series. The team had been in last place the previous year. The year was also highlighted with pitcher Gentaro Shimada, just 2 weeks before his 21st birthday, throwing the first no-hitter and perfect game in Whales history, becoming the youngest player to do so until Roki Sasaki did so in 2022.

However, this success did not last long, and the team quickly fell back into last place in 1961. The Whales made a comeback in 1962, but trailed four games behind the Hanshin Tigers to end up in second place. They lost the league championship again to the Tigers in 1964, only one game (.008 winning percentage) away from first place.

The team produced countless star players during the 1970s, but rarely ended the season above the .500 mark. The small Kawasaki Stadium made the Whales one of the most offensively productive teams in Japanese baseball history, but a weak pitching staff, and lack of financial support put the team out of serious contention.

By 1976, the team had been planning on moving from Kawasaki to Yokohama, and support from the mayor of Yokohama allowed the team to gain financial support from the Kokudo Company. 55% of the team&#x27;s share was retained by Taiyo, and the other 45% went to Kokudo.

===Yokohama Taiyo Whales (1978–1992)===
In 1978, the team moved to the newly-completed Yokohama Stadium in central Yokohama. The team name was changed to the to reflect the team&#x27;s new home town. The Kokudo Company sold its shares of the team to the Nippon Broadcasting System and TBS. The Nippon Broadcasting System obtained 30% of the shares, and TBS bought 15%, while Taiyo kept its 55%. The team enjoyed far more popularity during this period than in previous years, but continued to post only meager results in the standings, with their best placing being in 1979, when they finished second behind the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.

===Yokohama BayStars (1993–2011)===
In November 1992, Taiyo changed its name to the Maruha Corporation, as the company decided to discontinue the Taiyo brand due to restrictions on whaling in Japan, and renamed the team as the . Originally, they were meant to be the Yokohama Bay Stars (Stars would be the team&#x27;s nickname), in reference to the Yokohama Bay Bridge, but was changed to BayStars when fans began referring to them as that. The BayStars were the first Japanese professional baseball team not to include the name of the parent company in the team name.

Originally, the team was going to be renamed simply to the Yokohama Whales, but new restrictions on whaling in Japan convinced the company to drop the original name. Some superstitious fans had believed that dead whales put a curse onto the team (the Maruha Corporation was famous for its whale meat products), preventing the Whales from winning championships. In his visit to the United States, Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa remarked to the then-president Bill Clinton (who had proposed the international restriction on whaling) that the Maruha Corporation&#x27;s decision was reflective of Japan&#x27;s change in attitude towards whaling.

The BayStars remained a non-contender during the early 1990s, but gradually assembled the players that would contribute to the team&#x27;s championship in 1998. Akihiko Ohya became the manager in 1996, and almost caught up to the Yakult Swallows in 1997, ending in second place. Hiroshi Gondo (a pitching coach the previous year) became manager in 1998, and the BayStars won their first league championship in 38 years in 1998, defeating the Seibu Lions to win the Japanese championship series. The team&#x27;s consistent hitting, impeccable defense, (players from the BayStars won five golden glove awards in 1998) and solid pitching staff (rounded by closer Kazuhiro Sasaki) contributed to an epic 1998 season. The BayStars&#x27; offense in the &#x27;98 season became known as the &quot;Machine Gun Offense&quot; because of the quick succession of hits the Yokohama batters would get (mostly singles), and no game was ever over until the final out was recorded. Players who made up the Machine Gun Offense included Bobby Rose, Takuro Ishii, Motonobu Tanishige, Glenn Braggs (who left in 1996), and Takanori Suzuki.

The team dropped to third place in 1999 despite having the best offense in Japan and also setting a league record for team batting average at .294, alongside Rose breaking the Central League hits record, and would not be in serious contention for the championship until 2016. A major cause of this was due to the collapse of Yokohama&#x27;s pitching staff, as while the offense was good, the fact that Yokohama Stadium was more of a hitter friendly park, due to its outfield dimensions, would need them to have good pitching, alongside other factors, including Sasaki leaving for the Seattle Mariners in 2000, not being able to give a new contract to Rose, Tanishige leaving for the Dragons, and Takashi Saito leaving for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2001, the Maruha Corporation sold its remaining shares to TBS, giving TBS full ownership of the team, with the only stipulation being that TBS was not allowed to put their name in the team&#x27;s name. Akihiko Ohya returned in 2007 after leaving the team in 1997. In 2009 the team finished at the bottom of the league despite having a few young stars on the team like slugger Shuichi Murata and league batting champion Seiichi Uchikawa, and also having the pitching of Daisuke Miura and the signing of foreign star Ryan Glynn.

On May 18, 2009, The BayStars&#x27; management announced it had fired Ohya and appointed Tomio Tashiro as an acting manager.

===Yokohama DeNA BayStars (2012–present)===
In 2011, the franchise was acquired by a mobile telephone game company DeNA. The name was changed to reflect this, and they changed their mascot from Hosshey to Starman, who wore the new uniform.

In October 2015, Alex Ramírez, a former BayStars player and the only foreign-born player to have 2,000 hits in Japanese baseball, was named as manager for the 2016 season. He replaced Kiyoshi Nakahata, who resigned at the end of 2015 to take responsibility for the club&#x27;s poor performance. In 2016, Yokohama DeNA BayStars finished the regular season in third place (69–71–3), 19.5 games behind the league leader Hiroshima Toyo Carp (89–52–3). Defeating the second place Yomiuri Giants two games to one in the first stage of the Climax Series, the BayStars advanced to the Climax Series Final but lost to the Carp in five games.

In 2017, the BayStars again finished the regular season in third place (73–65–5) 14.5 games behind the league leader Hiroshima Toyo Carp (88–51–4). Their .252 team batting average and 134 home runs were both second best in the Central League. In the first round of the Climax Series, the BayStars defeated the second place Hanshin Tigers in three games and advanced to the Climax Series Final. Although losing the first game against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, the BayStars won the next four games to become 2017 Central League Climax Series Champions for the first time in 19 years. José López was the most valuable player (MVP) of the Central League Climax Series. The BayStars advanced to the 2017 Japan Series against the Pacific League Champion Fukuoka Softbank Hawks. The Hawks won the first three games of the series. Facing elimination, the BayStars won Games 4 and 5. At home in game 6, with the BayStars leading 3–2, the Hawks&#x27; Seiichi Uchikawa hit a game-tying solo home run off of the BayStars&#x27; star closer, Yasuaki Yamasaki. Keizo Kawashima hit the walk-off RBI single for SoftBank in the eleventh inning for the title. Hawks&#x27; pitcher Dennis Sarfate, with two saves and a Game 6 win, was named the Japan Series Most Valuable Player (MVP). Toshiro Miyazaki won the Fighting Spirit Award, given to the best player on the losing team. It was the first Japan Series loss for the team.

On March 13, 2023, Trevor Bauer agreed to an incentive-laden one-year, $4 million contract with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars. 

The following year, the BayStars signed both Andre Jackson and Anthony Kay, and in the middle of the season, signed Mike Ford, who would hit a walk off home run in his debut on the major league team. This, alongside the already existing power bats of Shugo Maki and 2024 CL Batting Champion Tyler Austin, and Katsuki Azuma taking over the ace spot after Shota Imanaga left for Major League Baseball, powered the BayStars to a 3rd place finish, alongside a fall from grace by the Hiroshima Toyo Carp by late August and September, qualifying them to the Central League Climax Series. They would sweep the Hanshin Tigers in the First Stage, then beat the Central League pennant winning Yomiuri Giants in 6 games to advance to the 2024 Japan Series, setting up a rematch with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. This time, despite losing the first 2 games, the BayStars would make a comeback to win the next 4, including 2 7 inning shutouts by Kay and Jackson in Games 4 and 5, respectively, to win their first Japan Series since 1998. Masayuki Kuwahara, after tying a Japan Series record with 9 RBIs, was named Japan Series Most Valuable Player, while Yoshi Tsutsugo, Jackson, and Kay, all won Outstanding Players Honors. With this, despite not being the worst team to win the Japan Series (that honor going to the 1978 Yakult Swallows, who won just 68 games despite playing 13 less games), at a record of 71-69-3, they officially held the record for the lowest winning percentage to win the Japan Series, which stood at .507.

<doc id="922865" wikidata="Q1439543" url="?curid=922865" title="Hamble-le-Rice">
<text>Hamble-le-Rice, commonly known as Hamble, is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Eastleigh in Hampshire, England. It is best known for being a flying training centre during the Second World War and is a popular yachting location. The village and the River Hamble also featured in the 1980s BBC television series &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;. The village centre, known as The Square, Hamble, has a more traditional English village aesthetic which differentiates it from the small industrial areas (mostly marinas) close to the village.

==Location==
Hamble-le-Rice is on the south coast of England, south-east of Southampton at the tip of the Hamble peninsula, bounded by Netley, Butlocks Heath, Bursledon, Southampton Water and the River Hamble.

==History==
Although previously known as &quot;Hamble&quot;, &quot;Hamelea&quot;, &quot;Hammel&quot;, and &quot;Ham-en-le-Rice&quot;, the village&#x27;s official name is now Hamble-le-Rice. The name &quot;Hamble&quot; is still in common usage. On 27 April 1992, the civil parish was renamed from &quot;Hamble&quot; to &quot;Hamble-le-Rice&quot;. To the south of the village, lies the site of an Iron Age promontory hillfort, Hamble Common Camp.

The place-name &#x27;Hamble-le-Rice&#x27; is first attested in a French document of 1147, where it appears as &quot;Amle&quot;. It appears as &quot;Hamele&quot; in 1270, and as &quot;hamele in the Rys&quot; in 1404. The village takes its name from the River Hamble; the &quot;Rice&quot; is the Old English &quot;hrīs&quot; meaning &#x27;brushwood&#x27; or perhaps by extension &#x27;scrubland&#x27;, and of which the modern form is the word &quot;rushes&quot;. Thus a modern form of the name might be &#x27;Hamble-in-the-Rushes&#x27;. An alternative explanation for the &quot;-le-Rice&quot; ending is that this derives from the Norman French &quot;en le rys&quot;, meaning &quot;on the hill&quot;.

The area is home to the remains of a defensive structure dating to the reign of King Henry VIII. Known as St Andrew&#x27;s Castle, investigations suggest that it consisted of a rectangular structure fronted by a gun platform with a semi-circular layout. The structure was protected by a moat, with a two gun platforms mounted on the counterscarp. The structure was intact as late as the early 17th century.

==Aerospace==
Hamble-le-Rice was the home of a major flying school before and during the Second World War for aircraft including the Spitfire, the Lancaster and the Wellington. Over 500 aircraft were built there including the prototype Armstrong Whitworth Ensign and Albemarle, which were first flown in 1938 and 1940. In 1960 the Air Corporations Joint Training Scheme (later, British Airways) fixed wing and helicopter training school was established there, as the Hamble College of Air Training. The south airfield has long since disappeared and the north airfield has been partially developed as housing; the remainder is overgrown and owned by property developers Persimmon.

The aviation industry retains a large interest in Hamble-le-Rice, with the Hamble Aerostructures factory, now a subsidiary of the Spanish company Aernnova, in Kings Avenue.

The following units were here at some point:

* No. 1 Basic Air Navigation School RAF
* No. 2 Air Experience Flight RAF
* No. 3 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School RAF
* No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School RAF
* No. 11 Air Observers Navigation School RAF
* No. 14 Reserve Flying School RAF
* No. 15 Ferry Pilots Pool ATA
* 780 Naval Air Squadron
* No. 2706 Squadron RAF Regiment
* Southampton University Air Squadron
==Industrial areas==
Hamble-le-Rice is home to three main marinas offering marine services and goods to the boating industry. In addition, large factories and smaller industrial units off Ensign Way and Hamble Lane are used by CooperVision, Qioptiq Photonics Ltd., BP, Hoyer, GE and others. Some of these businesses are 24-hour operations with large numbers of staff who commute to work. The fuel terminal itself is not visible from the B3397: there was extensive development in the early 2000s when wartime hangars were demolished and high-density housing built next to the road, near the terminal. The Royal Yachting Association (RYA), a non-profit organisation, has its offices in Hamble.

==Schools==
There are two schools in Hamble-Le-Rice:
* Hamble Primary School
* Hamble School, a secondary school (formerly Hamble Community Sports College)

==The River and Environment==
Hamble-le-Rice is a boating mecca: the nearby River Hamble is often packed with marine traffic and, during the summer, the whole village is crowded with people out enjoying the water, local restaurants and many pubs. The village and its river is one of the many locations that made up the fictional village of Tarrant, in the BBC television series &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, shown weekly on BBC One in the late 1980s.

Hamble-le-Rice is home to Hamble Common, a variety of estuary wildlife, and other scenic walks.

==Fuel terminal==
Hamble fuel terminal was opened by Shell in 1924, whilst BP was still afloat using a converted passenger liner as a fuel tender. In 1930 the two companies formed a joint venture and BP moved to Hamble. This partnership was dissolved in 1976, with the Hamble terminal passing to BP. A 2016 attempt to sell off the terminal was unsuccessful; however Hoyer now handles BPs bulk fuel road transport operation.
A pipeline runs under Southampton Water from the Fawley oil refinery which supplies the BP fuel terminal at Hamble. This fuel terminal was used to supply PLUTO, during the invasion of Europe in World War II. The PLUTO pipeline started at Shanklin on the Isle of Wight and was supplied by ship from Hamble. The jetty at this fuel terminal was extended in 1943/44 so that more ships could be loaded simultaneously.

Fuel is transported from this depot both day and night, in particular early mornings (between 3am and 6am), by 44 tonne road tankers along the B3397, as well as by pipeline to major industry and airports. Markers showing the route of the pipeline can be seen at various points in neighbouring Botley. A now disused branch line ran from the terminal to the Portsmouth to Southampton railway. This is now the scenic Strawberry Trail.

==Transport links==
The Hamble Peninsula has one main access road, the B3397, Hamble Lane, which is approximately long and goes straight through the village from the junction with the A27 Portsmouth road. Hamble Lane has had numerous incidences of traffic accidents. and at its intersection with Portsmouth Road an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) exists to monitor nitrogen dioxide traffic pollutants. The B3397 is a very high volume road; a traffic count in March 2003 showed around 16,300 vehicles in a 24-hour period. Daily traffic congestion and slow moving queues are due to the large number of inbound and outbound commuters, on staggered work shifts. Many businesses supply local companies as BP Oil UK, CooperVision and GE Aviation and minor industry and services within the four marinas and industrial areas off Ensign Way. Road oil and petrol tankers form the bulk of the heavy goods vehicles along this road, numbering a few hundred vehicle movements per day. The village is served by Hamble railway station, about two miles from the centre of the village, which provides hourly services to both Southampton Central and Portsmouth Harbour. It is also linked by a pedestrian ferry to Warsash, and has frequent bus services to Southampton - the &#x27;15&#x27; provided by Bluestar, via Netley and Woolston. There is also a service, the &#x27;49h&#x27;, to Hedge End, provided by Stagecoach South.

==People==
*Sir Sam Fay, General manager of the Great Central Railway 1902–22, was born here in 1856.
*Michael S. Robinson, naval art historian, was born here in 1910.
*Boat builder W.S. Luke and his sons Albert Luke and Walter Luke came here in the late 1880s to establish their boatyard.
*Ronnie and Reggie Kray had a cottage in the Village]
*Tracy Edwards, Skipper of &quot;Maiden&quot;, the first all-female round-the-world crew, lived in the village for a while.

*Dani Rowe, née King - cyclist (Women&#x27;s Team Pursuit World Champion 2011, 2012 and 2013; Women&#x27;s Team Pursuit Gold Medallist at London 2012) the cycle path into the village is named in her honour and she is the reason for the village post box being painted gold by the Royal Mail to commemorate her success at the home olympics.
*Basil Lubbock, sailor, soldier and historian lived in the village.

==Sport and leisure==
The main sporting activity in the village is sailing with it being the centre of UK offshore sailing and a hub for inshore yacht and keelboat racing. This is partly due to its mainland location and closeness to Cowes on the Isle of Wight. There are three sailing clubs within the village:

* Hamble River Sailing Club was founded in 1919
* RAF Yacht Club open its Hamble club house in 1952
* Royal Southern Yacht Club opened in the 1930s, with the club one of the oldest in the world being established in 1837

In addition Warsash Sailing Club based on the other side of the river also contributes significantly to sailing activities within the village hosting the annual spring series championship and other regattas. Together with offshore racing primarily organized by the Royal Ocean Racing Club and the Junior Offshore Group.

The Royal Yachting Association, the sport&#x27;s national governing body, has had its headquarters in the village since the early 2000s, when it moved from Eastleigh to a new purpose-built building.

The village has two non-league football clubs; Folland Sports and Hamble Club, both of which play in the Wessex League.

A speedway training track used to operate at Hamble in the early 1950s. There is now a sports college in Hamble to provide recreation and leisure.

<text>Prunus&quot; subg. &quot;Padus is a subgenus of &quot;Prunus&quot;, characterised by having racemose inflorescences. &quot;Padus&quot; was originally a distinct genus, but genetic and morphological studies have shown that &quot;Padus&quot; is polyphyletic. It has been proposed that all the racemose taxa within &quot;Prunus&quot; (&quot;Padus&quot;, &quot;Maddenia&quot;, &quot;Laurocerasus&quot; and &quot;Pygeum&quot;) are incorporated into a broad-sense &quot;Prunus&quot; subg. &quot;Padus&quot;.

&quot;Padus&quot; is the Latin name for the Po River. The term &quot;Padus&quot; (παδος) in reference to the plant comes from the Greek father of botany, Theophrastus, meaning &quot;from the River Po.&quot;

== Species ==
=== &quot;Padus&quot; ===
Species formerly included in the genus Padus are mostly incorporated into this subgenus, except &quot;P. maackii&quot; and &quot;P. xingshanensis&quot; which are included in &quot;Prunus&quot; subg. &quot;Cerasus&quot;. They are deciduous and have small, sour fruit usually only palatable to birds, hence the name bird cherries. Bird cherries are native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, including:
* Prunus alabamensis – Alabama black cherry, Southeastern United States
* &quot;Prunus brachypoda&quot; – China
* &quot;Prunus brunnescens&quot; – Sichuan and Yunnan
* &quot;Prunus buergeriana&quot; – Buerger&#x27;s bird cherry, East Asia and Himalaya
* &quot;Prunus cornuta&quot; – Himalayan bird cherry, Himalaya
* &quot;Prunus grayana&quot; – Gray&#x27;s bird cherry, China and Japan
* &quot;Prunus gyirongensis&quot; entire-leaved bird cherry, Tibet
* &quot;Prunus napaulensis&quot; Nepalese bird cherry, China and Himalaya
* &quot;Prunus obtusata&quot; - China
* &quot;Prunus padus&quot; – bird cherry or Eurasian bird cherry, Eurasia
* &quot;Prunus perulata&quot; – Sichuan and Yunnan
* &quot;Prunus serotina&quot; – black cherry, North America
* &quot;Prunus ssiori&quot; – Hokkaido bird cherry, Japan and Sakhalin
* &quot;Prunus stellipila&quot; – China
* &quot;Prunus velutina&quot; – China
* &quot;Prunus virginiana&quot; – chokecherry, North America
* &quot;Prunus wilsonii&quot; – Wilson&#x27;s bird cherry, China

=== &quot;Maddenia&quot; ===
Species formerly included in the genus Maddenia (, false bird cherries, or , odorous cherries) form a monophyletic group. They are similar to bird cherries but lack petals. There are five species:
* &quot;Prunus fujianensis&quot; – Fujian false bird cherry, southeastern China
* &quot;Prunus gongshanensis&quot; – Gongshan false bird cherry, southwestern China
* &quot;Prunus himalayana&quot; – Himalayan false bird cherry, southwestern China, Myanmar, Himalaya
* &quot;Prunus hypoleuca&quot; (synonyms: , &quot;Prunus incisoserrata&quot;) – false bird cherry, China
* &quot;Prunus hypoxantha&quot; – Sichuan false bird cherry, western to central China

=== &quot;Laurocerasus&quot; ===
Species formerly included in the genus Laurocerasus (cherry laurels) are evergreen. Examples are:
* &quot;Prunus amplifolia&quot;
* &quot;Prunus brittoniana&quot;
* &quot;Prunus caroliniana&quot;
* &quot;Prunus ilicifolia&quot;
* &quot;Prunus integrifolia&quot;
* &quot;Prunus javanica&quot;
* &quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot;
* &quot;Prunus lusitanica&quot;
* &quot;Prunus myrtifolia&quot;
* &quot;Prunus oblonga&quot;
* &quot;Prunus occidentalis&quot;
* &quot;Prunus oleifolia&quot;
* &quot;Prunus phaeosticta&quot;
* &quot;Prunus reflexa&quot;
* &quot;Prunus spinulosa&quot;
* &quot;Prunus tucumanensis&quot;
* &quot;Prunus undulata&quot;

=== &quot;Pygeum&quot; ===
The Pygeum group is monophyletic if &quot;P. africana&quot; (possibly as well as &quot;P. crassifolia&quot;) is excluded. All the species formerly included in the genus &quot;Pygeum&quot;, except &quot;P. africana&quot; (and &quot;P. crassifolia&quot;), are native to tropical Asia and Oceania. They are similar to cherry laurels but lack petals. Examples are:
* &quot;Prunus africana&quot;
* &quot;Prunus arborea&quot;
* &quot;Prunus ceylanica&quot;
* &quot;Prunus costata&quot;
* &quot;Prunus crassifolia&quot;
* &quot;Prunus dolichobotrys&quot;
* &quot;Prunus gazelle-peninsulae&quot;
* &quot;Prunus grisea&quot;
* &quot;Prunus lancilimba&quot;
* &quot;Prunus malayana&quot;
* &quot;Prunus oligantha&quot;
* &quot;Prunus oocarpa&quot;
* &quot;Prunus polystachya&quot;
* &quot;Prunus pullei&quot;
* &quot;Prunus schlechteri&quot;
* &quot;Prunus turneriana&quot;
* &quot;Prunus wallaceana&quot;

<doc id="922874" wikidata="Q3695947" url="?curid=922874" title="Kettlewell">
<text>Kettlewell is a village in Upper Wharfedale, North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it lies north of Grassington, at the point where Wharfedale is joined by a minor road (Cam Gill Road) which leads north-east from the village over Park Rash Pass to Coverdale. Great Whernside rises to the east. The population of the civil parish (Kettlewell with Starbotton) was 322 at the 2011 census, with an estimated population of 340 in 2015. The population was recorded as being at 321 according to the United Kingdom 2021 census.

==History==
It is believed that the name Kettlewell is Anglo Saxon and comes from Chetelewelle which means a bubbling spring or stream. Signs of the farming methods of Romano-British and early medieval agriculture can still be seen in terraced fields to the north and the south of the village.

In the 13th century a market was established in Kettlewell, which became a thriving community. The Thursday market mostly sold corn outside the King&#x27;s Arms. A watermill was built on the River Wharfe in the 13th century to grind corn.
Textiles (and, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, lead mining) revitalised the village and Kettlewell&#x27;s appearance today derives much from its past 200 years. The remains of the smelting-mill, used from 1700 to 1880, can be seen near the meeting of Cam Gill and Dowber Gill Becks half a mile above the village.

In 1686 Kettlewell and Starbotton were almost destroyed in a flood. Heavy rainfall descended on the adjacent hills and cascaded down into the village demolishing several houses and causing the residents to flee.

On 5 July 2014, the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the village.

==Governance==
The village is part of Kettlewell with Starbotton parish in the former Craven District of North Yorkshire. The village is in the parliamentary constituency of Skipton and Ripon; the seat has been held by the Conservative Party ever since its creation in 1983.

==Geography==

Kettlewell is situated in Upper Wharfedale around two miles upstream of where it converges with Littondale. The B6160 crosses the River Wharfe by a stone bridge. The village is situated just west of the confluence of Dowber Gill Beck and Cam Gill Beck, which join to form Kettlewell Beck flowing through the village to join the River Wharfe. There are many small bridges across Kettlewell Beck which dissect the village.

==Economy==

Historically Kettlewell&#x27;s economy revolved around lead mining and farming. Farming was adversely affected by the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. There are several farms which mostly rely on sheep farming. There is a small service economy serving village residents, tourists and walkers. Kettlewell is on the Dales Way and is a popular starting point for ascents of Great Whernside and Buckden Pike. Rights of way connect the village to Nidderdale and Arncliffe in Littondale. The three village pubs are on the Inn Way and the Racehorses Hotel, the Bluebell Inn and the King&#x27;s Head all provide accommodation. In addition to the three inns, there are numerous guesthouses, holiday cottages and a village shop, a tasting deli, two cafés and a filling station with a mechanic&#x27;s garage. There is a large YDNPA car park and the National Park Authority operates public conveniences adjacent to the main car park.
The village has 17th and 18th century houses, including the vicarage. St Mary&#x27;s Church, Kettlewell was rebuilt during the 19th century and stands on a site that dates back to 1120 when the (Norman) de Arches family established a church here. An example of 20th century architecture is the 1960s-built chapel at Scargill House, which is now a Christian conference centre.

==Transport==
Kettlewell is connected by bus to Skipton, Grassington and Buckden. The village is the northern starting point of the Yorkshire Water Way to Langsett Reservoir in South Yorkshire. Kettlewell lies on the Dales Way footpath.

==Fauna and flora==
The area is known for Swaledale Sheep which are extensively farmed in the area. There are deer in the area, though these are rarely sighted. There are areas of forestland to the south-east of the village, while the open valley to the north has little tree cover.

==Events==
In August the village hosts a scarecrow festival where scarecrows, dressed up as different characters, are placed around the village.

==Popular culture==
*A children&#x27;s television character from &quot;The Rottentrolls&quot; takes its name from the village.
*The 1991 series &quot;Chimera&quot; was mostly filmed in the village.
*Kettlewell represented the village of Knapely in the 2003 film, &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;.
*The 2010 film &quot;The Trip&quot; includes a musical song and dance routine in the village.

<doc id="922877" wikidata="Q288625" url="?curid=922877" title="Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now">
<text>The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) is an international collection of autonomous community-based organizations that advocates for low- and moderate-income families by working on neighborhood safety, voter registration, health care, affordable housing, and other social issues. They, along with a number of other community unions, are affiliated under ACORN International.

== Organization ==
In the US, ACORN was composed of a number of legally distinct nonprofit entities and affiliates including a nationwide umbrella organization established as a 501(c)(4) that performed lobbying; local chapters established as 501(c)(3) nonpartisan charities; and the national nonprofit and nonstock organization, ACORN Housing Corporation. ACORN&#x27;s priorities included: better housing and wages for the poor, more community development investment from banks and governments, better public schools, labor-oriented causes and social justice issues. ACORN pursued these goals through demonstrations, negotiation, lobbying for legislation, and voter participation.

Unlike in the US, ACORN groups in other countries have little organizational funding. Under the ACORN model, most members are volunteers. Employed union organizers come from those working in local ACORN campaigns rather than from existing organizations and are paid a low wage. The union works on local and national level campaigns.

==History==

Founded in 1970 by Wade Rathke and Gary Delgado, at its peak ACORN had over 500,000 members and more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in over 100 cities across the U.S. In 2002, ACORN International was created to aid the spread of ACORN&#x27;s model to other countries. There are currently ACORN affiliates in Cameroon, Canada, Czech Republic, England, France, Honduras, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Peru, Scotland, Tunisia, United States, and Wales.

In the US, ACORN suffered a damaging nationwide controversy in the fall of 2009 after James O&#x27;Keefe and Hannah Giles secretly made, edited and released videos of interactions with low-level ACORN personnel in several of their offices, leading to several investigations by state officials that concluded the videos were inaccurately portraying the personnel as encouraging criminal behavior. The organization didn&#x27;t recover from the negative publicity in the US and dissolved, with ACORN members and organizers forming new organizations such as the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) Action. ACORN groups outside of the US continued unaffected. ACORN, under ACORN International, still works within the US through its Home Savers Campaign, for example.

== Issues and actions ==
===Predatory lending and affordable housing===
ACORN investigated complaints against companies accused of predatory lending practices. ACORN also worked to support strict state laws against predatory practices, organized against foreclosure rescue scams, and steered borrowers toward loan counseling; Following a three-year campaign, Household International (now owned by HSBC Holdings and renamed HSBC Finance Corporation), one of the largest subprime lenders in the country, and ACORN announced on November 25, 2003, a proposed settlement of a 2002 national class-action lawsuit brought by ACORN. The settlement created a $72 million foreclosure avoidance program to provide relief to household borrowers who were at risk of losing their homes. The settlement came on the heels of an earlier $484 million settlement between Household, Attorneys General, and bank regulators from all 50 U.S. states.

===Voter registration===
Since the 1980s, ACORN conducted large-scale voter registration drives, focusing primarily on registering poor and minority citizens.

===Education===
In 2001, ACORN opposed the privatization of some New York City schools, favoring its own Charter School plan.

===Gun control===
In 2006, ACORN intervened on behalf of Jersey City, New Jersey, in a lawsuit brought against the city challenging a local ordinance that limited individuals&#x27; handgun purchases to one gun a month. The Hudson County Superior Court struck down the ordinance on the grounds that it violated the New Jersey Constitution&#x27;s Equal Protection clause, and a state statute prohibiting towns and municipalities from enacting firearms legislation. On September 29, 2008, the New Jersey Superior Court Appellate Division denied ACORN&#x27;s appeal of the Hudson County Superior Court&#x27;s decision striking down Jersey City&#x27;s ordinance.

===Home Defender Program===
In 2009, ACORN advocated allowing homeowners delinquent in their mortgage payments to remain in their homes pending a government solution to the housing foreclosure crisis. ACORN introduced a program called the Home Defender Program, intended to mobilize people to congregate at homes faced with foreclosure to &quot;defend a family&#x27;s right to stay in their homes.&quot;

== Legal issues ==
In a 2007 case in Washington state, in which seven temporary employees of ACORN were charged with submitting fraudulent voter registrations, ACORN agreed to pay King County $25,000 for its investigative costs and acknowledged that the national organization could be subject to criminal prosecution if fraud occurred. In May 2009, six ACORN employees in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to charges of a combined total of 51 counts of forgery and other violations while registering voters during the 2008 election cycle.

During the 2008 election season, ACORN gathered over 1.3 million voter registration forms in 21 states. Project Vote estimated that 400,000 registrations collected by ACORN were ultimately rejected, the vast majority for being duplicate registrations submitted by citizens. Project Vote estimated that only a few percent of registrations were fraudulent, based on past years and samples from some drives in 2008. Project Vote estimated that 450,000 of the registrations collected by ACORN represented first-time voters, while the remainder were address changes submitted by citizens updating their addresses.

ACORN has fired employees for fraudulent registration practices and turned them over to authorities. Of 26,513 registrations submitted by ACORN over a nine-month period in San Diego County, California, 4,655 were initially flagged, but 2,806 of those were later validated. County officials said this resulted in a 7% error rate by ACORN, compared to usually less than 5% for voter drives by other organizations.

In plea deals in a 2009 Las Vegas case, former ACORN field director Amy Busefink and ACORN official Christopher Edwards pleaded guilty to &quot;conspiracy to commit the crime of compensation for registration of voters,&quot; in connection with a quota system for paid registration staff. Edwards was sentenced to a year&#x27;s probation and agreed to testify for prosecutors in charges against ACORN and against Busefink. Busefink appealed her case to the Nevada Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. In April 2011, ACORN entered a guilty plea to one count of felony compensation for registration of voters, for which they were fined $5,000, but did not concede that the law was constitutional.

==ACORN International==

ACORN International was created in 2002 as an offshoot of ACORN to aid the spread of ACORN&#x27;s model to other countries, including Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and Peru. The first ACORN branch in the UK opened in Bristol in 2014 by three people, two of whom were graduates of the Community Organisers programme.

Other groups are affiliated with ACORN: for example, Living Rent in Scotland and Alliance Citoyenne in France.

<text>Esztergom County (, , , ) was an administrative county of the Kingdom of Hungary, situated on both sides of the Danube river. Its territory is now divided between Hungary and Slovakia. The territory to the north of the Danube is part of Slovakia, while the territory to the south of the Danube is part of Hungary.

==Geography==

Esztergom County shared borders with the counties , , and . Its territory comprised a 15 km strip to the west of the lower part of the Garam river and continued some 10 km south of the Danube river. Its area was 1076 km2 around 1910.

==Capitals==
The capital of the county was the Esztergom Castle and the town of Esztergom, then from 1543 onwards, when the territory became part of the Ottoman Empire, the county officials fled to Nagyszombat and Érsekújvár, the latter functioning as a seat (e. g. 1605–1663) and finally since 1714 the previous situation was restored.

==History==
A predecessor of the county existed as early as in the 9th century, when Esztergom () was one of the most important castles of Great Moravia. The Esztergom county as a comitatus arose at the end of the 10th century as one of the first comitatus of the Kingdom of Hungary. The county had a special status in that since 1270 its heads were at the same time the archbishops of Esztergom.

In the aftermath of the revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire Hungary came under military administration and was divided into five military districts. In 1850 Komárom and Esztergom counties were divided along the Danube: the areas north of the river (along with a small part of Győr County on the north bank and the Szőny suburb of Komárom on the southern bank), including Esztergom&#x27;s Muzsla (&#x27;seat-district&#x27;), were combined into a new Komárom county (under the German name ) administered by the Military District of Preßburg; the southern parts of the traditional Komárom and Esztergom counties (the Gran (Esztergom) and and Komárom&#x27;s Kócs and Dotis ) were merged to form a new (Esztergom) county administered by the Military District of Pest-Ofen. The districts were dissolved and traditional counties restored in 1860.

Until the later 19th century the area of Lábatlan and Piszke (now merged with Lábatlan) was an enclave belonging to Komárom county within Esztergom county.

In the aftermath of World War I, the part of Esztergom county north of the Danube became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. The southern part remained in Hungary and merged with the southern part of Komárom county to form Komárom-Esztergom County in 1923. 
Following the provisions of the First Vienna Award, the Czechoslovak part became again part of Hungary in November 1938. The old Esztergom county was recreated. After World War II, the Trianon borders were reestablished and Komárom-Esztergom County was recreated again. In 1950, it was renamed to Komárom county and received some additional territories. This county was eventually renamed to Komárom-Esztergom county again in 1990. The part of the county north of the river Danube is now in Slovakia and is part of the Nitra region.
==Demographics==

In 1900, the county had a population of 87,651 people and was composed of the following linguistic communities:

Total:

* Hungarian: 69,429 (79,2%)
* German: 9,995 (11,4%)

* Serbian: 15 (0,0%)
* Romanian: 7 (0,0%)
* Ruthenian: 1 (0,0%)
* Other or unknown: 652 (0,7%)

According to the census of 1900, the county was composed of the following religious communities:

* Greek Catholic: 54 (0,1%)
* Greek Orthodox: 33 (0,1%)
* Unitarian: 6 (0,0%)
* Other or unknown: 5 (0,0%)

<doc id="922895" wikidata="Q860172" url="?curid=922895" title="Canal Saint-Martin">
<text>The Canal Saint-Martin () is a 4.6 km (2.86 mi) long canal in Paris, connecting the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq to the river Seine. Nearly half its length (), between the Rue du Faubourg du Temple and the Place de la Bastille, was covered in the mid-19th century to create wide boulevards and public spaces on the surface. The canal is drained and cleaned every 10–15 years, and it is always a source of fascination for Parisians to discover curiosities and even some treasures among the hundreds of tons of discarded objects.

==History==
Gaspard de Chabrol, prefect of Paris, proposed building a canal from the river Ourcq, 100 km northeast of Paris, to supply the city with fresh water to support a growing population and help avoid diseases such as dysentery and cholera, while also supplying fountains (including the monumental Elephant of the Bastille) and allowing the streets to be cleaned. Construction of the canal was ordered by Napoleon I in 1802 and construction took place until 1825, funded by a new tax on wine. 

The canal was also used to supply Paris with grain, building materials and other goods, carried on canal boats. Two ports were created on the canal in Paris to unload the boats: Port de l&#x27;Arsenal and the Bassin de la Villette.

By the 1960s, traffic had dwindled to a trickle and the canal narrowly escaped being filled in and paved over for a highway.

==Route==
The entrance to the canal from the vast terminal basin (Bassin de la Villette) of the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq is at a double lock near the Place de Stalingrad. Continuing towards the river Seine, the canal is bordered by the Quai de Valmy on the right bank and the Quai de Jemmapes on the left, passing through three more double staircase locks before disappearing under the three successive &quot;voûtes&quot; (tunnels) – du Temple, Richard-Lenoir and Bastille – to emerge in the Port de l&#x27;Arsenal, the principal port for boats visiting and residing in Paris.

==Tourism==
Today, the canal is a popular destination for Parisians and tourists. Some take cruises on the canal in passenger boats. Others watch the barges and other boats navigate the series of locks and pass under the attractive cast-iron footbridges. There are many popular restaurants and bars along the open part of the canal, which is also popular with students.

==Métro stations==
The canal can be accessed from the following Paris Métro stations: Stalingrad, République, Goncourt, Jacques Bonsergent, Jaurès.

==In popular culture==
Art
The canal inspired painters such as Alfred Sisley (1839-1899). In the present day, many intricate works of graffiti are visible along the canal, and there is a large multimedia art space on its banks at the former municipal undertakers building at 104 rue d&#x27;Aubervilliers (&#x27;104&#x27;).

Film and television
* The canal was the setting in part for Jean Vigo&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; in 1934.
* The canal is shown in the 1938 film &quot;Hôtel du Nord&quot;, directed by Marcel Carné.
*In &quot;Les Malheurs d&#x27;Alfred&quot; (1972), Pierre Richard and Anny Duperey meet each other at the beginning of the film, thinking of committing suicide in the canal.
*The French police series &quot;&quot; uses an external shot of a building at 52 rue Bichat, located next to the canal, as the frontage of the police station. Cars were often shown exiting the building and the canal and adjacent neighbourhood were used as backdrops for scenes.
* The canal appears in Jean-Pierre Jeunet&#x27;s famous 2001 film known in English as &quot;Amélie&quot;, in which the title character is shown enjoying one of her favourite activities: skipping stones at the locks of the canal.
* The canal was used as an escape route for Ethan Hunt and his team in the 2018 film &quot;&quot;.
* The Canal was used by John Wick as a route to get closer to Saint-Eustache in the 2023 film &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4&quot;.
* The canal was used in the 2024 film Under Paris.

Music
*Édith Piaf sings about the canal in the song &quot;Les mômes de la cloche&quot;, written by Vincent Scotto and Decaye, music by Médinger, in 1936.
*Courteeners song &quot;The Dilettante&quot; mentions the canal and talks of the pleasant atmosphere surrounding it.

Literature
*Georges Simenon&#x27;s novel &quot;Maigret and the Headless Corpse (Maigret et le corps sans tête)&quot; is set in and around the canal.

<text>Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, Inc. was an American entertainment company active from 1967 until 1969.

== History ==
Seven Arts Productions acquired Jack L. Warner&#x27;s controlling interest in Warner Bros. Pictures for $32 million in November 1966. The merger between the two companies was completed by July 15, 1967, and the combined company was named Warner Bros.-Seven Arts.

The acquisition included Warner Bros. Records (which was renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Records), and Reprise Records. Later that same year, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts purchased Atlantic Records. Those record labels were combined in 1971 with two other acquisitions (Elektra Records and its sister label Nonesuch Records) in a new holding company, Warner-Elektra-Atlantic, under the direction of Mo Ostin and Joe Smith.

The head of production was Kenneth Hyman, son of Seven Arts co-founder Eliot Hyman. The first film of production and distribution was &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;. &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; was the final film produced by Warner Bros. Pictures before and after changing its name.

== Acquisition by Kinney ==
On July 4, 1969, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was acquired by Kinney National Company, and, in August that year, Ted Ashley became the chairman of the film studio. On December 16, 1969, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was rebranded as Warner Bros. Inc.

The final film to be released under the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts name was &quot;Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed&quot;, which was released in February 1970. The studio&#x27;s next film, &quot;Woodstock&quot;, which was released in March, was credited as a Warner Bros. production, and this credit would be applied to all other productions from the studio afterward with Warner Bros. reestablished as a major film studio.

In September 1971, due to a financial scandal in its parking lot operation business, Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets as National Kinney Corporation, and changed its name to Warner Communications Inc. on February 10, 1972.

<doc id="922902" wikidata="Q7757341" url="?curid=922902" title="The Plague (New Zealand band)">
<text>The Plague was a New Zealand theatrical punk/art rock band that was active from 1977 to 1979, and was led by Richard von Sturmer. Their most famous performance was at the Nambassa Music Festival in 1979 and they recorded four tracks for the &quot;Infectious&quot; EP. Von Sturmer went on to a career in writing and film-making and other members went on to play in bands such as The Whizz Kids, Blam Blam Blam, The Swingers, Coconut Rough and Pop Mechanix.

== History==
In 1977, Aucklander Richard von Sturmer returned from England, &quot;charged with the new punk movement that flourished there. He assembled a troupe of &#x27;actors&#x27; and they rehearsed a series of theatre/music pieces revolving around his poetry and showmanship. They called themselves The Plague.&quot; They wore unusual costumes and performed satires on bureaucracy, cancer and necrophilia. One of the members was guitarist Tim Mahon (The Whizz Kids, Blam Blam Blam), from the same school as von Sturmer, Westlake Boys High School, who joined in 1978. Mahon wanted to improve the group&#x27;s musical ability to match the theatrics and presentation, and recruited a trio who had played together at Westlake Boys High School, consisting of Mark Bell on guitar (Whizz Kids, Blam Blam Blam, Coconut Rough, Scribble), Ian Gilroy on drums (Whizz Kids, Crocodiles, The Swingers) and Andrew McLennan, aka Andrew Snoid, on keyboards and backing vocals (Whizz Kids, Coconut Rough, The Swingers, NZ Pop, The Zoo). With two guitarists and no bass guitar player, Mahon learned to play bass guitar.

The Plague&#x27;s first gig was with punk band The Scavengers at the State Theatre on Symonds Street in Auckland. Von Sturmer and his backing vocalists, the Snoids, appeared naked apart from a covering of paint. Their most famous performance was in front of an audience of 30,000 at Nambassa Music Festival in January 1979, again in body paint; as related in the novel &quot;The Predictions&quot;, the lead singer in cobalt blue, the guitarist red, and the backing singers yellow.

In 1979, they recorded at Harlequin Studios in Mt Eden Road in Auckland. Four tracks were later released as the &quot;Infectious&quot; EP: &quot;Seven Day Plan&quot;, &quot;Kiwi Keith&quot;, &quot;Mystery No Mystery&quot; and &quot;Voodoo T.V.&quot;

Don McGlashan described the music in an interview for Radio New Zealand&#x27;s Musical Chairs in April 1998, &quot;It was a really vicious noise, but it was really fun, fun to be part of.&quot; He played with The Plague a few times, coming straight from playing French horn in the Symphonia of Auckland (now the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra), dressed in a &#x27;penguin suit&#x27; and to stand on stage while people wearing only a coat of paint (assorted colours) would jump around him. Don McGlashan said of von Sturmer, &quot;Richard was a really prolific writer – and still is.&quot; They used material from Inside Information; songs such as &quot;Frank Gill&#x27;s An Idiot&quot; and &quot;Private Property&quot;.

By late 1979, von Sturmer and the Snoids left the band and the other four musicians became the Whizz Kids. Von Sturmer went on to a career in writing and film-making.

Ian Gilroy then left the Whizz Kids to play with The Crocodiles, and then The Swingers. Andrew Snoid left to front Pop Mechanix. Mark Bell and Tim Mahon, with Don McGlashan who had been playing with the Whizz Kids, formed Blam Blam Blam.

The Plague reformed with its original lineup (apart from the drummer) to play at Neck of the Woods in Auckland on 22 April 2021. The performance launched a 12&quot; album featuring four studio tracks and four live tracks all recorded in 1979 and a 7&quot; single with two tracks recorded in 2020.

<text>Coconut Rough were a short-lived New Zealand pop/new wave band formed in 1982.

Despite their 1983 first single, &quot;Sierra Leone&quot;, hitting the top five, and the band being named &quot;Most Promising Group of the Year&quot; at that year&#x27;s RIANZ Awards they split up in 1984.

==History==
The band was formed in 1982 by lead singer Andrew Snoid, formerly with New Zealand bands the Whizz Kids, Pop Mechanix and Australian-based New Zealand group the Swingers, and guitarist Mark Bell. Bell later joined Snoid in a reformed Pop Mechanix. Other member were bassist Dennis &quot;Choc&quot; Te Whare, keyboardist Stuart Pearce and drummer Paul Hewitt, and later bassist Bones Hillman. They decided on the name &quot;Coconut Rough&quot; based on a type of sweet treat popular in Australia and New Zealand.

The band&#x27;s biggest hit was also their first single. &quot;Sierra Leone&quot; reached number five in the 1983 New Zealand charts. The song was aided by one of the first New Zealand music videos with special effects. In 2001, Sierra Leone was voted the 94th-best New Zealand song of all time by members of APRA.

They were an opening act for The Police at their Western Springs concert in 1984, but had folded before the end of that year.

==History==
Krapina has been known since 1193. It has always been a favorite site for castles and country houses of Croatian and Hungarian rulers.

In the first half of the 15th century, it was an important center of the Counts of Celje, who additionally fortified the town and expanded the nearby castle. Later, it came into the possession of the Keglević family.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Krapina was a district capital in Varaždin County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

==Prehistoric site==
In 1899, on a hill called Hušnjakovo near modern Krapina, the archaeologist and paleontologist Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger found over 800 fossil remains of Neanderthals.

The half-cave in Krapina was soon listed among the world&#x27;s science localities as a significant fossil finding site, where the largest and richest collection of the Neanderthal man had ever been found.

At the site where the Neanderthal remains were discovered there is now a state-of-the-art Neanderthal museum which also includes an extensive section on evolution, making it one of the most interesting evolutionary museums in Europe. It is surrounded by a park with many statues of Neanderthals and the game they hunted, a bear, a moose and a beaver set in the actual locations.

==Culture==
Krapina is home to the yearly &quot;Festival kajkavske popevke&quot; (The festival of kajkavian song) sung in the local Kajkavian language.

There is also a nearby municipality of Krapinske Toplice (Krapina spa) with numerous thermal springs and spa tourist infrastructure. Krapina is also the birthplace of the linguist and language reformer Ljudevit Gaj. His home is now a museum where visitors can learn about his life and work.

Since 1997, Franciscan monastery and St. Catherine&#x27;s church in Krapina are hosts of the &quot;Krapinafest&quot;, annual contemporary Christian music festival.

==Notable person==
* Mirko Dražen Grmek (1924–2000), Croatian and French historian of medicine, was born in Krapina.
* Ljudevit Gaj (born Ludwig Gay, 1809–1872), was a Croatian linguist, politician, journalist, and writer born in Krapina.

== Transportation ==
Krapina is served by the A2 freeway and state road D1. It has a train station on the R106 corridor and a bus station which also serves as a hub for the bus company &quot;Presečki d.o.o.&quot; - the company connects Krapina with numerous towns across the county and region.

<text>Eva Pawlik (4 October 1927 – 31 July 1983) was an Austrian figure skater, show star, actress and commentator. She was the 1948 Olympic silver medalist, the 1948 World silver medalist, and the 1949 European champion.

==Early life==
Born in 1927, Pawlik was regarded as a child prodigy, able to jump a single Axel and do a large number of spins at the age of four. Before World War II, she was considered an &quot;exceptionally promising 9-year-old Viennese&quot; figure skater in the United States. In Europe, she starred in &quot;The Fairy Tale Of The Steady Tin Soldier&quot; together with World champion Felix Kaspar. This legendary vaudeville number was internationally highly successful, being performed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Munich, Bern, Amsterdam, Brussels, Lyon, Paris and London. Pawlik was called the &quot;Shirley Temple on ice&quot;. In her teens she would get up at 4 a.m. daily to run to the Vienna ice rink (Wiener Eislaufverein), for practice before going to school. Austrian skaters were impeded in the 1930s and 40s by the fact that there were no indoor skating halls and they were restricted to practicing in winter.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s absorption of Austria in 1938 and World War II destroyed sportsmen&#x27;s lives and careers. Pawlik, for example, was due to compete (aged 12) in the singles in the 1940 Winter Olympics, and in the pairs with her later husband Rudi Seeliger. However, they could only take part in domestic competitions, becoming German youth champions, both individually and as a pair team. In addition to that, they became the 1942 Austrian pairs champions (called Ostmark champions at that time due to the fact that Austria did not exist from 1938 to 1945). Drafted into the German Army, Rudi Seeliger was captured by the Red Army and returned to Austria in 1949.

==Competitive career==
Pawlik´s coaches included the 1914 World silver medalist Angela Hanka, World champion Gustav Hügel, Rudolf Kutzer and Edi Scholdan.

=== 1948 season ===

In 1947, Pawlik was rated best European skater and second in the world. However, Austrian skaters were barred from entering European and World competitions at that time. In 1948 she won three silver medals; at the Europeans, at the Olympics and at Worlds. Pawlik entered the 1948 European Championships as the favorite. Nevertheless, she finished second to non-European Barbara Ann Scott from Canada. At the time, skaters from non-European countries could compete at the European Championships. In Sandra Stevenson&#x27;s opinion, it was &quot;not surprising that North Americans, whose skating activities had not been interrupted&quot; during World War II, &quot;should do well when the sport resumed in 1947. When Eva Pawlik of Austria unsuccessfully challenged Barbara Ann Scott in 1948 one reason given for her failure was that she skated with dirty boots and holes in her tights. The boots were so old that they no longer responded to cleaning and the holes were darned. It was the best she could manage with all the shortages in her country.&quot;

In 1948, Pawlik performed in exhibition skating in the United States. She appeared together with U.S. Champion Gretchen Merrill in the Broadmoor Ice Revue, produced by Edi Scholdan in Colorado Springs. She was also asked to appear in a movie starring Gene Kelly. He wanted to combine his dancing with her skating. She declined, as turning professional would have excluded her from the 1949 championships.

=== 1949 season ===

In 1949, despite suffering acute appendicitis, Pawlik beat her rival Aja Zanova in Milan to become European champion. In the World Championships held in Paris, Pawlik was lying a close second behind Zanova when one of the heels on her skates broke. Sabotage was suspected, but never proven. The judges did not allow her to continue with borrowed skates and Zanova went on to win. Though having good chances to win the World title one year later, Pawlik decided to turn professional because her parents needed financial support.

== Professional career ==

Pawlik joined the Vienna Ice Revue and performed a program that was considered by some journalists and figure skating experts to be technically and artistically slightly superior to the free skating of World champion Vrzáňová. Pawlik also played major parts in the productions of two movies featuring the Revue, &quot;Spring On The Ice&quot; (&quot;Frühling auf dem Eis&quot;), 1950, and &quot;Revue Of Dreams&quot; (&quot;Traumrevue&quot;), 1959. The first is said to have inspired the later double Olympic champion, Ludmilla Belousova, to take up skating.

In 1952, Robert Stolz dedicated his first ice operetta, &quot;Eternal Eve&quot; (&quot;Die ewige Eva&quot;), to Eva Pawlik. Morris Chalfen, the boss of the competitor enterprise Holiday On Ice, considered Pawlik Europe&#x27;s best show star on the ice since the thrice Olympic champion Sonja Henie. Additionally, Pawlik and Seeliger had become one of the world&#x27;s best professional pair teams. They left the Vienna Ice Revue in 1954 and starred in Hanns Thelen&#x27;s Scala Eisrevue for some years. In 1958, they returned to the Vienna Ice Revue.

== Later life ==

In 1961, Pawlik retired from skating and became the first European and the world&#x27;s first female figure skater to become a TV figure skating commentator. She commentated all European and World Championships in figure skating and the 1964, 1968 and 1972 Olympic Games for the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF).

In 1973, she began her third profession as a teacher of German and English at a Viennese secondary school (pupils from 10 to 18). In 1954, she earned her doctorate in German and English at the University of Vienna. In 1979, Pawlik became severely ill and died in 1983, four months after her husband.

==Legacy==

The exhibition &quot;The Vienna Ice Revue. Austria&#x27;s ambassador of the past&quot; took place at the Bezirksmuseum Wien-Meidling from January to March 2008.

<doc id="922933" wikidata="Q644730" url="?curid=922933" title="Albert Coady Wedemeyer">
<text>Albert Coady Wedemeyer (9 July 1896 – 19 December 1989) was a United States Army general who served in Asia during World War II from October 1943 to the end of the war in 1945. Previously, he was an important member of the War Planning Board which formulated plans for the invasion of Normandy. He was General George C. Marshall&#x27;s chief consultant when in the spring of 1942 he traveled to London with General Marshall and a small group of American military men to consult with the British in an effort to convince the British to support the cross channel invasion. Wedemeyer was a staunch anti-communist. While in China during the years 1944 to 1945 he was Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Chief of Staff and commanded all American forces in China. Wedemeyer supported Chiang&#x27;s struggle against Mao Zedong and in 1947 President Truman sent him back to China to render a report on what actions the United States should take. During the Cold War, Wedemeyer was a chief supporter of the Berlin Airlift.

==Early life==
Wedemeyer was born on 9 July 1896, in Omaha, Nebraska, and was a graduate of the Creighton Preparatory School.

==Prewar career==

In 1919, he graduated from the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York. On his first assignment, at Fort Benning, Georgia, he became uncharacteristically drunk; a court-martial gave him six months of restrictions and reduced pay. By his own account, he was various grades of lieutenant for 17 years, before finally being promoted to captain in 1935.

Between 1936 and 1938, Captain Wedemeyer was one of a handful of United States Army officers, including Herman F. Kramer, who attended the Kriegsakademie in Berlin. While there he received instruction in armored warfare from Heinz Guderian and in &quot;Geopolitik&quot; from Karl Haushofer. He also met senior Nazi Party leaders such as Hermann Göring and Martin Bormann. Soon after graduation from this school, he attended, as one of many international observers, the German Army grand maneuvers of 1938.

When he returned to Washington that year, Wedemeyer analyzed Nazi Germany&#x27;s grand strategy and dissected German thinking. Wedemeyer thus became the United States military&#x27;s foremost authority on German tactical operations, whose &quot;most ardent student&quot; was George C. Marshall. Wedemeyer was greatly influenced and his career aided by his father-in-law, Lieutenant General Stanley Dunbar Embick, the Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of the War Plans Division of the United States War Department.

==World War II==
At the outbreak of World War II, Wedemeyer was a lieutenant colonel assigned as a staff officer to the War Plans Division. Notably, in 1941 he was the chief author of the &quot;Victory Program&quot;, which advocated the defeat of Germany&#x27;s Wehrmacht in Europe as the prime war objective for the United States. This plan was adopted and expanded as the war progressed. Additionally, Wedemeyer helped to plan the Normandy Invasion.

===China-Burma-India Command===

In 1943, Wedemeyer was reassigned to the South-East Asia Theatre to be Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander of the South East Asia Command (SEAC), Lord Louis Mountbatten.

On 27 October 1944, Wedemeyer received a telegram from General George C. Marshall directing him to proceed to China to assume command of United States forces in China, replacing General Joseph Stilwell. In his new command, Wedemeyer was also named Chief of Staff to the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The telegram contained a host of special instructions and limitations on Wedemeyer&#x27;s command when dealing with the Nationalist government. Wedemeyer later recalled his initial dread over the assignment, as service in the China theater was considered a graveyard for American officials, both military and diplomatic. When Wedemeyer arrived at Stilwell&#x27;s headquarters after Stilwell&#x27;s dismissal, he was dismayed to discover that Stilwell had intentionally departed without seeing him, and did not leave a single briefing paper for his guidance, though departing United States military commanders habitually greeted their replacement in order to thoroughly brief them on the strengths and weaknesses of headquarters staff, the issues confronting the command, and planned operations. Searching the offices, Wedemeyer could find no documentary record of Stilwell&#x27;s plans or records of his former or future operations. Wedemeyer then spoke with Stilwell&#x27;s staff officers but learned little from them because Stilwell, according to the staff, kept everything in his &quot;hip pocket&quot;.

During his time in the CBI, Wedemeyer attempted to motivate the Nationalist Chinese government to take a more aggressive role against the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces in the war. He was instrumental in expanding the Hump airlift operation with additional, more capable transport aircraft, and continued Stilwell&#x27;s programs to train, equip, and modernize the National Revolutionary Army. His efforts were not wholly successful, in part because of the ill will engendered by his predecessor, as well as continuing friction over the role of the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Wedemyer was credited for his advice in helping the NRA to defeat the Japanese forces in the Battle of West Hunan, as well as retaking Guilin and Liuzhou. Wedemeyer also supervised logistical support for the United States Army Air Forces in China. These forces included the United States Twentieth Air Force partaking in Operation Matterhorn and the Fourteenth Air Force operated by General Claire Chennault.

On 7 December 1945, Wedemeyer with General Douglas MacArthur, and navy Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, the three top military officers in the Far East, recommended to the Pentagon that it transport six more Chinese Nationalist armies into North China and Manchuria. However they also suggested that &quot;the U.S. assistance to China, as outlined above, be made available as basis for negotiation by the American Ambassador to bring together and effect a compromise between the major opposing groups in order to promote a united and democratic China.&quot;

The issue of forcing the Nationalists into a coalition government with the Communists would later become a central issue in the fierce &quot;Who lost China&quot; political debates in the United States during 1949–51. On 10 July 1945, Wedemeyer had informed General Marshall:

Wedemeyer later said as a military commander, his statement was intended as a call to force the long-heralded, but never implemented, military alliance between the Nationalist government and Chinese Communists in order to rout undefeated Japanese forces in China. He later told others that he had opposed a political coalition. (Tsou, 1962).

After Japan&#x27;s capitulation, Wedemeyer became alarmed that some Japanese troops were surrendering to Communist Chinese forces. He wanted seven American divisions to be sent to China, but General Marshall replied that it should not be given priority over Japan and Korea. Wedemeyer served in China into 1946.

==Postwar==
After returning from China, Wedemeyer was promoted to Army Chief of Plans and Operations. In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman sent Wedemeyer to China and Korea to examine the &quot;political, economic, psychological and military situations.&quot; The result was the &quot;Wedemeyer Report&quot; in which Wedemeyer stressed the need for intensive United States training of and assistance to the Nationalist armies.

Wedemeyer&#x27;s 1947 report painted a picture of the Chinese Civil War that was both opportune and dire. Chiang&#x27;s armies were far better-equipped than their Communist adversaries (who had not yet received weapons and training from the Soviets in Manchuria), and pushing them back on all fronts, but ammunition, fuel, and spare parts were severely lacking. These had been promised by Lend-Lease, but not delivered and still charged to Chaing&#x27;s account. Thus, while the Nationalists had over 16,000 trucks virtually all of them were rendered inoperable, forcing his troops to march on foot. Ammunition shortages were also causing Nationalist divisions to lose battles, and Chaing&#x27;s troops were forced to scavenge abandoned American dumps because no deliveries had been made. Even worse, much surplus weaponry and ammunition in the Pacific was being destroyed rather than utilized, and Chiang&#x27;s government was charged exorbitant prices for what remained. For example, bazookas were sold to Greece at $3.65 apiece, while Chiang&#x27;s government had to pay $162. For rifles, the price difference was $5.10 and $51, respectively. Ammunition cost differences were similar, China being charged $85 for 1000 rifle rounds and $95 for 1000 machine gun rounds, compared to $4.55 and $4.58 elsewhere. Wedemeyer recommended an immediate correction of these deficiencies and sending leftover equipment to China rather than blowing it up.

Lacking confidence in the Nationalist government caused by Joseph Stilwell and George Marshall&#x27;s meddling, President Harry S. Truman not only rejected the recommendations in the report but also imposed an arms embargo against the Nationalist government, thereby intensifying the bitter political debate over the role of the United States in the Chinese Civil War. While Secretary of State George C. Marshall had hoped that Wedemeyer could convince Chiang Kai-shek to institute those military, economic, and political reforms that would create a Nationalist-Communist coalition, he supported Truman&#x27;s view and suppressed publication of Wedemeyer&#x27;s report, further provoking resentment by Nationalist and communist advocates both inside and outside the US government and the armed forces. The report was reprinted, however, in the 1949 China White Paper.

Following completion of the report, he assumed command of the Sixth United States Army in San Francisco, California; in this capacity, Wedemeyer &quot;thought of himself as cut off from further military policy making.&quot;

After the fall of China to Communist forces, Wedemeyer would testify before Congress that while the loss of morale was indeed a cause of the defeat of the Nationalist Chinese forces, the Truman administration&#x27;s 1947 decision to discontinue further training and modernizing of Nationalist forces, the US-imposed arms embargo, and constant anti-Nationalist sentiment expressed by Western journalists and policymakers were the primary causes of that loss of morale. In particular, Wedemeyer stressed that if the US had insisted on experienced American military advisers attached at the lower battalion and regimental levels of Nationalist armies, as it had done with Greek army forces during the Greek Civil War, the aid could have more efficiently been used. He also said that the immediate tactical assistance would have resulted in Nationalist armies performing far better in combat against the Communist Chinese.

Vice Admiral Oscar C. Badger, General Claire Chennault, and Brigadier General Francis Brink also testified that the arms embargo was a significant factor in the loss of China.

In 1948, Wedemeyer supported General Lucius D. Clay&#x27;s plan to create an airbridge during the Berlin Crisis.

After the Communist victory in 1949, Wedemeyer became intimately associated with the China Lobby and openly voiced his criticism of those allegedly responsible for the Communist takeover of China. In 1951, after the outbreak of the Korean War, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy said that Wedemeyer had prepared a wise plan that would keep China a valued ally, which it had been sabotaged: &quot;only in treason can we find why evil genius thwarted and frustrated it.&quot; The evil geniuses, McCarthy said, included Marshall.

Wedemeyer became a hero to United States anticommunists, and gave many lectures around the country. After retiring as a lieutenant general in 1951, he was promoted to full general by act of Congress on 19 July 1954.

In 1957, Wedemeyer was affiliated with the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena. On 23 May 1985, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan.

==Death and legacy==
On 17 December 1989, Wedemeyer died at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Wedemeyer and his wife Elizabeth Dade Embick (1903–2000) are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Friends Advice, in Boyds, Maryland, was his permanent home throughout his military career and until his death. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

<doc id="922939" wikidata="Q3914781" url="?curid=922939" title="Acorn">
<text>The acorn is the nut of the oaks and their close relatives (genera &quot;Quercus&quot;, &quot;Notholithocarpus&quot; and &quot;Lithocarpus&quot;, in the family Fagaceae). It usually contains a seedling surrounded by two cotyledons (seedling leaves), enclosed in a tough shell known as the pericarp, and borne in a cup-shaped cupule. Acorns are long and on the fat side. Acorns take between 5 and 24 months (depending on the species) to mature; see the list of &quot;Quercus&quot; species for details of oak classification, in which acorn morphology and phenology are important factors.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;acorn&quot; (earlier &quot;akerne&quot;, and &quot;acharn&quot;) is related to the Gothic name &quot;akran&quot;, which had the sense of &quot;fruit of the unenclosed land&quot;. The word was applied to the most important forest produce, that of the oak. Chaucer spoke of &quot;achornes of okes&quot; in the 14th century. By degrees, popular etymology connected the word both with &quot;corn&quot; and &quot;oak-horn&quot;, and the spelling changed accordingly. The current spelling (emerged century) derives from association with &quot;ac&quot; (Old English: &quot;oak&quot;) + &quot;corn&quot;.

==Ecology==

Acorns play an important role in forest ecology when oaks are plentiful or dominant in the landscape. The volume of the acorn crop may vary widely, creating great abundance or great stress on the many animals dependent on acorns and the predators of those animals. Acorns, along with other nuts, are termed mast.

Wildlife that consume acorns as an important part of their diets include birds, such as jays, pigeons, some ducks, and several species of woodpeckers. Small mammals that feed on acorns include mice, squirrels and several other rodents. One beetle species, &quot;Thorectes lusitanicus&quot;, also feeds on acorns. Acorns have a large influence on small rodents in their habitats, as large acorn yields help rodent populations to grow.

Large mammals such as pigs, bears, and deer also consume large amounts of acorns; they may constitute up to 25% of the diet of deer in the autumn. In Spain, Portugal and the New Forest region of southern England, pigs are still turned loose in &quot;dehesas&quot; (large oak groves) in the autumn, to fill and fatten themselves on acorns. Heavy consumption of acorns can, on the other hand, be toxic to other animals that cannot detoxify their tannins, such as horses and cattle, especially if eaten in excess.

The larvae of some moths and weevils also live in young acorns, consuming the kernels as they develop.

Acorns are attractive to animals because they are large and thus efficiently consumed or cached. Acorns are also rich in nutrients. Percentages vary from species to species, but all acorns contain large amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fats, as well as the minerals calcium, phosphorus and potassium, and the vitamin niacin. Total food energy in an acorn also varies by species, but all compare well with other wild foods and with other nuts.

Acorns also contain bitter tannins, the amount varying with the species. Since tannins, which are plant polyphenols, interfere with an animal&#x27;s ability to metabolize protein, creatures must adapt in different ways to use the nutritional value acorns contain. Animals may preferentially select acorns that contain fewer tannins. When the tannins are metabolized in cattle, the tannic acid produced can cause ulceration and kidney failure.

Animals that cache acorns, such as jays and squirrels, may wait to consume some of these acorns until sufficient groundwater has percolated through them to leach out the tannins. Other animals buffer their acorn diet with other foods. Many insects, birds, and mammals metabolize tannins with fewer ill effects than do humans.

Species of acorn that contain large amounts of tannins are very bitter, astringent, and potentially irritating if eaten raw. This is particularly true of the acorns of American red oaks and English oaks. The acorns of white oaks, being much lower in tannins, are nutty in flavor; this characteristic is enhanced if the acorns are given a light roast before grinding.

Tannins can be removed by soaking chopped acorns in several changes of water, until the water no longer turns brown. Cold water leaching can take several days, but three to four changes of boiling water can leach the tannins in under an hour. Hot water leaching (boiling) cooks the starch of the acorn, which would otherwise act like gluten in flour, helping it bind to itself. For this reason, if the acorns will be used to make flour, then cold water leaching is preferred.

Being rich in fat, acorn flour can spoil or molder easily and must be carefully stored. Acorns are also sometimes prepared as a massage oil.

Acorns of the white oak group, &quot;Leucobalanus&quot;, typically start rooting as soon as they are in contact with the soil (in the fall), then send up the leaf shoot in the spring.

===Dispersal agents===

Acorns are too heavy for wind dispersal, so they require other ways to spread. Oaks therefore depend on biological seed dispersal agents to move the acorns beyond the mother tree and into a suitable area for germination (including access to adequate water, sunlight and soil nutrients), ideally a minimum of from the parent tree.

Many animals eat unripe acorns on the tree or ripe acorns from the ground, with no reproductive benefit to the oak, but some animals, such as squirrels and jays serve as seed dispersal agents. Jays and squirrels that scatter-hoard acorns in caches for future use effectively plant acorns in a variety of locations in which it is possible for them to germinate and thrive.

Even though jays and squirrels retain remarkably large mental maps of cache locations and return to consume them, the odd acorn may be lost, or a jay or squirrel may die before consuming all of its stores. A small number of acorns manage to germinate and survive, producing the next generation of oaks.

Scatter-hoarding behavior depends on jays and squirrels associating with plants that provide good packets of food that are nutritionally valuable, but not too big for the dispersal agent to handle. The beak sizes of jays determine how large acorns may get before jays ignore them.

Acorns germinate on different schedules, depending on their place in the oak family. Once acorns sprout, they are less nutritious, as the seed tissue converts to the indigestible lignins that form the root.
==Uses==
In some cultures, acorns once constituted a dietary staple, though they have largely been replaced by grains and are now typically considered a relatively unimportant food, except in some Native American and Korean communities.

Several cultures have devised traditional acorn-leaching methods, sometimes involving specialized tools, that were traditionally passed on to their children by word of mouth.

===Culinary===
Acorns served an important role in early human history and were a source of food for many cultures around the world. For instance, the Ancient Greek lower classes and the Japanese (during the Jōmon period) would eat acorns, especially in times of famine. In ancient Iberia they were a staple food, according to Strabo. Despite this history, acorns rarely form a large part of modern diets and are not currently cultivated on scales approaching that of many other nuts. However, if properly prepared (by selecting high-quality specimens and leaching out the bitter tannins in water), acorn meal can be used in some recipes calling for grain flours. In antiquity, Pliny the Elder noted that acorn flour could be used to make bread. Varieties of oak differ in the amount of tannin in their acorns. Varieties preferred by Native Americans, such as &quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot; (California black oak), may be easier to prepare or more palatable.

In Korea, an edible jelly named &quot;dotorimuk&quot; is made from acorns, and &quot;dotori guksu&quot; are Korean noodles made from acorn flour or starch. In the 17th century, a juice extracted from acorns was administered to habitual drunkards to cure them of their condition or else to give them the strength to resist another bout of drinking.

Roasted acorn flour is a main ingredient in sweet cakes special to Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq.

Acorns have frequently been used as a coffee substitute, particularly when coffee was unavailable or rationed. The Confederates in the American Civil War and Germans during World War I (when it was called &quot;Ersatz&quot; coffee), which were cut off from coffee supplies by Union and Allied blockades respectively, are particularly notable past instances of this use of acorns.

====Use by Native Americans====
Acorns are a traditional food of many indigenous peoples of North America, and long served an especially important role for Californian Native Americans, where the ranges of several species of oaks overlap, increasing the reliability of the resource. One ecology researcher of Yurok and Karuk heritage reports that &quot;his traditional acorn preparation is a simple soup, cooked with hot stones directly in a basket,&quot; and says he enjoys acorns eaten with &quot;grilled salmon, huckleberries or seaweed.&quot;
Unlike many other plant foods, acorns do not need to be eaten or processed right away, but may be stored for a long time, much as squirrels do. In years that oaks produced many acorns, Native Americans sometimes collected enough acorns to store for two years as insurance against poor acorn production years.

After drying in the sun to discourage mould and germination, acorns could be cached in hollow trees or structures on poles to keep them safe from mice and squirrels. Stored acorns could then be used when needed, particularly during the winter when other resources were scarce. Acorns that germinated in the fall were shelled and pulverized before those germinating in spring. Because of their high fat content, stored acorns can become rancid. Moulds may also grow on them.

The lighting of ground fires killed the larvae of acorn moths and acorn weevils by burning them during their dormancy period in the soil. The pests can infest and consume more than 95% of an oak&#x27;s acorns.

Fires also released the nutrients bound in dead leaves and other plant debris into the soil, thus fertilizing oak trees while clearing the ground to make acorn collection easier. Most North American oaks tolerate light fires, especially when consistent burning has eliminated woody fuel accumulation around their trunks. Consistent burning encouraged oak growth at the expense of other trees less tolerant of fire, thus keeping oaks dominant in the landscapes.

Oaks produce more acorns when they are not too close to other oaks and thus competing with them for sunlight, water and soil nutrients. The fires tended to eliminate the more vulnerable young oaks and leave old oaks which created open oak savannas with trees ideally spaced to maximize acorn production.

===In culture===
====Art====
A motif in Roman architecture, also popular in Celtic and Scandinavian art, the acorn symbol is used as an ornament on cutlery, furniture, and jewelry; it also appears on finials at Westminster Abbey.

In the Artemis Fowl book series, &quot;The Ritual&quot; describes the method used by faeries to regenerate their magical powers.

====Military symbolism====

The acorn was used frequently by both Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. Modern US Army Cavalry Scout campaign hats still retain traces of the acorn today.

====Contemporary use as symbol====
The acorn is the symbol for the National Trails of England and Wales, and is used for the waymarks on these paths. The acorn, specifically that of the white oak, is also present in the symbol for the University of Connecticut.

Acorns are also used as charges in heraldry.

<text>In physics, a paste is a substance that behaves as a solid until a sufficiently large load or stress is applied, at which point it flows like a fluid. In rheological terms, a paste is an example of a Bingham plastic fluid.

Pastes typically consist of a suspension of granular material in a background fluid. The individual grains are jammed together like sand on a beach, forming a disordered, glassy or amorphous structure, and giving pastes their solid-like character. It is this &quot;jamming together&quot; that gives pastes some of their most unusual properties; this causes paste to demonstrate properties of fragile matter. 

Examples include starch pastes, toothpaste, mustard, and putty.

In pharmacology, paste is a basic pharmaceutical form. It consists of a fatty base (e.g., petroleum jelly) and at least 25% of a solid substance (e.g., zinc oxide). Pharmaceutical pastes are typically intended for external application to the skin. They are usually thick and do not melt at physiologic temperatures.

<text>William Henry Tunner (July 14, 1906 – April 6, 1983) was a general officer in the United States Air Force and its predecessor, the United States Army Air Forces. Tunner was known for his expertise in the command of large-scale military airlift operations, first in Air Transport Command (ATC) during World War II, commanding The Hump operation, and later in Military Air Transport Service (MATS) during the Berlin Airlift in 1949–1951. He eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant general and commanded MATS itself.

Tunner appointed Nancy Love to the staff of his first major command in 1942 and was a key figure in the planning and creation of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Ferrying Service.

==Military career==

===Air Corps===
Tunner entered the United States Military Academy on July 1, 1924, appointed from the 5th District of New Jersey by United States Representative Ernest R. Ackerman. He was commissioned on June 9, 1928, as a second lieutenant of field artillery, then selected the Air Corps as his branch of service, commissioned 2nd lieutenant AC on September 8, 1928, when he entered flight training at Brooks Field, Texas. At the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, he received his final flight check from Capt. Claire Chennault and was awarded his pilot&#x27;s wings in September 1929.

His first assignment was to Rockwell Field, California, as a pilot in the 11th Bombardment Squadron of the 7th Bomb Group, flying a bi-wing Keystone LB-5 bomber. There he was introduced to transport aircraft, ferrying a Fokker tri-motor to Sacramento with passengers aboard.

In October 1931 he was assigned to Randolph Field as a flying instructor, but was ill-suited to the task. After a board of review, Tunner was assigned to squadron officer duties during his tour so that he could continue flying. He was promoted to first lieutenant on July 1, 1934. In January 1935 he transferred to France Field, Panama Canal Zone, as a pilot with the 7th Observation Squadron. Again he worked a variety of staff duties in his squadron and as assistant operations officer of the 19th Composite Wing, advancing to the temporary rank of captain on September 26, 1935. In February 1937, back in his permanent rank of 1st lieutenant, he returned to the United States as adjutant at Lawson Field, Georgia, and as an observation pilot with the 16th Observation Squadron, which performed duties as the school squadron for the Infantry School at Fort Benning. He was promoted to the permanent rank of captain on June 9, 1938.

Tunner attended the third Air Corps Tactical School &quot;short course&quot; in 1939, followed by his first command, the tiny Memphis Air Corps Detachment of the 1st Military Department, largely a recruiting billet. On January 31, 1941, he was promoted to major and began duties in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps (OCAC) at Washington, D.C., in the Personnel Division, assigning himself collateral flying duties at nearby Bolling Field.

===Army Air Forces===
Prior to World War II on June 8, 1941, Major Tunner became a key figure in the creation of what became the Air Transport Command (ATC) when he was the second staff officer selected by Col. Robert Olds for the headquarters of the new Air Corps Ferrying Command. He advanced from adjutant and personnel officer of ACFC to executive officer on November 26. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 5, 1942, and full colonel on March 1, 1942.

He was thus in a key position when ACFC, originally intended to deliver aircraft from factory to their point of embarkation overseas, had its name and mission changed under its second commander, Brig. Gen. Harold George, to support of U.S. and Allied operations worldwide by aerial transportation of supplies, personnel, and equipment using multi-engine aircraft. The first wartime organizational tables for ACFC (officially the Army Air Forces Ferrying Command after February 1942), were drawn up by Tunner, who organized and became commander of its Domestic Division on April 1, 1942. On July 1, 1942, the Domestic Division was renamed the Ferrying Division under ATC and continued its mission of aircraft delivery.

Under the aegis of the Ferrying Division, Tunner was responsible for organizing the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) in September 1942, a program of civil service female pilots to shuttle planes from factory to Army airfields. The WAFS program, developed from a plan first drawn up by Tunner&#x27;s executive trouble-shooter Nancy Harkness Love, merged in August 1943 with Jacqueline Cochran&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Flying Training Detachment (WFTD) to become the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS).

Tunner was promoted to Brigadier general on June 30, 1943, and tapped for command of the airlift supply operation from India to China in the spring of 1944. He made an inspection trip in the CBI theater with his prospective staff in June, where he piloted a C-46 Commando over &quot;The Hump&quot;. He went back to the CBI in August and took command of what had become the India-China Division (ATC) on September 4, 1944. Tunner&#x27;s orders were to increase cargo tonnage levels flown by the airlift but also to reduce an alarmingly high accident level. Tunner incorporated four-engined Douglas C-54 Skymaster cargo planes into a second route to China called the &quot;Low Hump&quot; that widened the airlift corridor from 50 to 200 miles to increase efficiency. He instituted maintenance and flying safety programs that reduced the deadly accident rate to less than a quarter of what it had been when he took command, despite more than doubling the tonnage and hours flown.

On November 10, 1945, he returned to the United States, where he became Air Inspector of ATC on January 1, 1946. He held a series of division commands in the post-war ATC beginning February 1, 1946, and was promoted to Major general on July 10.

===United States Air Force===
When the Army Air Forces became the United States Air Force in September 1947, the Military Air Transport Service was formed by combining ATC and the Naval Air Transport Service. Maj. Gen. Laurence S. Kuter selected Tunner to be his deputy commander for operations in March 1948.

Almost immediately, Tunner&#x27;s reputation for managing airlift recommended him to bring efficiency to the Berlin Airlift. The organization of the five-week-old operation was haphazard because USAFE was a tactical organization without experience in running transport operations, trying to feed the city using 54 C-54 Skymasters supplemented by a section of C-47 Skytrains, basically using bomber operation methods. On July 22, 1948, the National Security Council met with European commander Gen. Lucius D. Clay and concluded that expansion of the operation was essential. Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg immediately appointed Tunner to the job, and he arrived in Wiesbaden, Germany, on July 28, 1948. By mid-August Tunner had added 72 C-54s to the effort and brought in two-thirds of all USAF C-54 aircrews worldwide to fly the airlift 24 hours a day.

Tunner brought such a level of organization to the Berlin operation that the per-day tonnage brought into Berlin by the planes eventually exceeded the amount of material that had been brought in by train. Tunner is credited with organizing each western ally controlled air corridor into a one way path, which improved the efficiency of the airlift. His strict control of his subordinates along with his unorthodox solutions to problems earned him the nickname Willie-the-Whip. This included taking advantages of opportunities to enhance the operation such as upon learning about pilot Gail Halvorsen&#x27;s dropping of candy mid-flight for the children of Berlin. Tunner ordered this activity expanded to &quot;Operation Little Vittles&quot; in which tons of candy would be dropped over Berlin in small parachutes created by American civilians, producing a major propaganda success for the Western Allies. Unfortunately for Tunner, much of the credit for the success of the airlift, and the innovations that led to that success, were given to General Curtis LeMay, the Air Force commander in Europe until October 1948.

The airlift program was gradually wound down as squadrons were broken up and reassigned to their regular MATS duties. Tunner returned to his post in MATS on September 5, 1949. The outbreak of the Korean War took him to Tokyo, Japan, to command a new airlift organization in the Far East Air Forces, Combat Cargo Command (Provisional) on September 10, 1950.

Combat Cargo Command had the initial job of providing the airlift for the Inchon invasion and subsequent airborne operations. Tunner&#x27;s success in meeting the commitments is attested to by the Distinguished Service Cross awarded him on the spot by General Douglas MacArthur. Combat Cargo Command was discontinued on January 25, 1951, when a permanent organization, 315th Air Division, was activated. In its four-and-a-half months under &quot;Tonnage Tunner&quot;, it had made 32,632 sorties; delivered 130,170 tons of cargo; carried 155,294 passengers including paratroopers; and evacuated 72,960 casualties.

In February 1951 Tunner was assigned to the Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, as deputy commander. In 1953, he was appointed commander, United States Air Forces in Europe, a post he held four years during the buildup of NATO air forces.

In 1957, he was reassigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force as deputy chief of staff for operations. On July 1, 1958, concurrently with the assumption by the Military Air Transport Service of the &quot;Single Managership for Airlift&quot;, he returned to the air transport field as commander, MATS, with headquarters at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. He became a prime and impassioned spokesman for the development and deployment of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter as the primary jet airlift transport for MATS, and supported the election of John F. Kennedy as president to achieve that end when the Eisenhower administration rejected it.

Tunner retired from the Air Force on May 31, 1960 after a heart problem was diagnosed.

In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross, Tunner received the Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star Medal with one oak leaf cluster and the Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters. His foreign awards included Honorary Companion of the Order of the Bath from the United Kingdom, Order of Pao Ting (Tripod) Yun Hui from China and the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross with star of the Order of Merit from West Germany in 1982. He was also conferred an honorary doctor of military science degree by the University of Maryland in 1956.

===Legacy===
The Lieutenant General William H. Tunner Award is presented annually by the commander of the Air Mobility Command to the &quot;outstanding strategic airlift crew&quot; in the United States Air Force.

In 1997 the USAF began procurement of the 60K Tunner Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE), a diesel-driven aircraft loader built by Systems &amp; Electronics, Inc. for loading and unloading wide-body cargo transports, designed to be deployed by C-5, C-17 and C-141 transports. It has the capability to load and unload the C-130, C-141, C-5 and C-17, as well as the commercial DC-10, L-1011 and B-747 freighters. The equipment was named to honor Tunner by an industry naming contest.

First recipient of the Airlift/Tanker Association Hall of Fame Award in 1989.

A street in the Berlin borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf is named after him.

==Personal biography==
Tunner was the fourth of five children of immigrants from Leoben, Austria. His ancestors Peter Tunner the Elder (1786–1844) and Peter Tunner (1809–1897) were metallurgists, mining specialists and montanists who co-founded Austria&#x27;s famous &quot;Bergakademie&quot; (&quot;Mining Academy&quot;) at Leoben. His father was an engineer as well and settled in Roselle, New Jersey, where Tunner was raised.

Tunner married twice, the first to Sarah Margaret Sams of Meridian, Mississippi. They had two sons, Joseph C. and Dr. William H. Tunner, Jr. Sarah was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor following surgery on November 12, 1945, and remained in a coma for a year and a half. After her death in 1947, Tunner married a former WASP pilot Margaret Ann (Ann) Hamilton of Enid, Oklahoma in 1951, and they had a daughter, Hamilton Suzanne Tunner Hudson.

Tunner died at his farm in Ware Neck, Virginia on April 6, 1983, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Penny dreadfuls were cheap popular serial literature produced during the 19th century in the United Kingdom. The pejorative term is roughly interchangeable with penny horrible, penny awful, and penny blood. The term typically referred to a story published in weekly parts of 8 to 16 pages, each costing one penny. The subject matter of these stories was typically sensational, focusing on the exploits of detectives, criminals, or supernatural entities. First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls featured characters such as Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin, Varney the Vampire, and Spring-heeled Jack.

The BBC called penny dreadfuls &quot;a 19th-century British publishing phenomenon&quot;. By the 1850s, there were up to a hundred publishers of penny-fiction, and in the 1860s and 1870s more than a million boys&#x27; periodicals were sold per week. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described penny dreadfuls as &quot;Britain&#x27;s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young&quot;, and &quot;the Victorian equivalent of video games&quot;.

While the term &quot;penny dreadful&quot; was originally used in reference to a specific type of literature circulating in mid-Victorian Britain, it came to encompass a variety of publications that featured cheap sensational fiction, such as story papers and booklet &quot;libraries&quot;. The penny dreadfuls were printed on cheap wood pulp paper and were aimed at young working class men. The popularity of penny dreadfuls was challenged in the 1890s by the rise of competing literature, especially the half-penny periodicals published by Alfred Harmsworth.

==Origins==
Crime broadsides were commonly sold at public executions in the United Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries. These were often produced by printers who specialised in them. They were typically illustrated by a crude picture of the crime, a portrait of the criminal, or a generic woodcut of a hanging taking place. There would be a written account of the crime and of the trial and often the criminal&#x27;s confession of guilt. A doggerel verse warning others to not follow the executed person&#x27;s example, to avoid their fate, was another common feature.

Victorian-era Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates. With the rise of capitalism and industrialisation, people began to spend more money on entertainment, contributing to the popularisation of the novel. Improvements in printing resulted in newspapers such as Joseph Addison&#x27;s &quot;The Spectator&quot; and Richard Steele&#x27;s &quot;Tatler&quot;, and England&#x27;s more fully recognizing the singular concept of reading as a form of leisure; it was, of itself, a new industry. Other significant changes included an increased capacity for travel via the invention of tracks, engines, and the corresponding railway distribution (the first public railway, Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825). These changes created both a market for cheap popular literature and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. The first penny serials were published in 1836 to meet this demand. Between 1830 and 1850 there were up to 100 publishers of penny-fiction, in addition to many magazines which embraced the genre. The serials were priced to be affordable to working-class readers and were considerably cheaper than the serialised novels of authors such as Charles Dickens, which cost a shilling [twelve pennies] per part.

==Subject matter==

The stories were reprints, or sometimes rewrites, of the earliest Gothic thrillers such as &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; or &quot;The Monk&quot;, as well as new stories about famous criminals. The first ever penny blood, published in 1836, was called &quot;Lives of the Most Notorious Highwaymen, Footpads, &amp;c.&quot; The story continued over 60 issues, each eight pages of tightly-packed text with one half-page illustration. Some of the most famous of these penny part-stories were &quot;The String of Pearls: A Domestic Romance&quot; (introducing Sweeney Todd, &quot;the Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;), &quot;The Mysteries of London&quot; (inspired by the French serial &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot;), and &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; (1845–1847). &quot;Varney&quot; is the tale of the vampire Sir Francis Varney and introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences—it was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire.

Highwaymen were popular heroes; &quot;Black Bess or the Knight of the Road&quot;, outlining the largely imaginary exploits of real-life English highwayman Dick Turpin, continued for 254 episodes and was well over 2,000 pages long. Turpin was not executed until page 2,207. Some lurid stories purported to be based on fact: &quot;Spring-Heeled Jack&quot; was what would now be called an urban myth. The first &#x27;sighting&#x27; of him was in 1837, and he was described as having a terrifying and frightful appearance, with diabolical physiognomy, clawed hands and eyes that &quot;resembled red balls of fire&quot;. He was mainly sighted in London but popped up elsewhere and seems to have been a source of frightened fascination for several decades. At the height of Spring-Heeled Jack hysteria, several women reported being attacked by a clawed monster of a man breathing blue flames. The last &#x27;sighting&#x27; was in Liverpool in 1904.

In 1838, Robin Hood featured in a series of penny dreadfuls titled &quot;Robin Hood and Little John: or, The Merry Men of Sherwood Forest&quot;, which sparked the beginning of the mass circulation of Robin Hood stories. Other serials were thinly-disguised plagiarisms of popular contemporary literature. The publisher Edward Lloyd, for instance, published numerous hugely successful penny serials derived from the works of Charles Dickens, such as &quot;Oliver Twiss&quot; and &quot;Nickelas Nicklebery&quot;.
The illustration which featured at the start of each issue was an integral part of the dreadfuls&#x27; appeal, often acting as a teaser for future installments. As one reader said, &quot;You see&#x27;s an engraving of a man hung up, burning over a fire, and some [would] go mad if they couldn&#x27;t learn ... all about him.&quot; One publisher&#x27;s rallying cry to his illustrators was &quot;more blood – much more blood!&quot;

Working class boys who could not afford a penny each week often formed clubs that would share the cost, passing the flimsy booklets from reader to reader. Other enterprising youngsters would collect several consecutive parts then rent the volume out to friends. In 1866, &quot;Boys of England&quot; was introduced as a new type of publication, an eight-page magazine that featured serial stories as well as articles and shorts of interest. Numerous competitors quickly followed, including &quot;Boys&#x27; Leisure Hour&quot;, &quot;Boys&#x27; Standard&quot;, and &quot;Young Men of Great Britain&quot; (a short lived companion to &quot;Boys of England&quot;). As the price and quality of other types of fiction works were the same, these also fell under the general definition of penny dreadfuls.

Appearing in the 1860s, American dime novels were edited and rewritten for a British audience. These appeared in booklet form, such as the &quot;Boy&#x27;s First Rate Pocket Library&quot;. Frank Reade, Buffalo Bill, and Deadwood Dick were all popular with the penny dreadful audience.

The penny dreadfuls were influential since they were, in the words of one commentator, &quot;the most alluring and low-priced form of escapist reading available to ordinary youth, until the advent in the early 1890s of future newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth&#x27;s price-cutting &#x27;halfpenny dreadfuller. In reality, the serial novels were overdramatic and sensational but generally harmless. If anything, the penny dreadfuls, although not the most enlightening or inspiring of literary selections, resulted in increasingly literate youth in the Industrial period. The wide circulation of this sensationalist literature, however, contributed to an ever-greater fear of crime in mid-Victorian Britain.

==Decline==
The popularity of penny dreadfuls among British children was challenged in the 1890s by the rise of competing literature. Leading the challenge were popular periodicals published by Alfred Harmsworth. Priced at one half-penny, Harmsworth&#x27;s story papers were cheaper and, at least initially, were more respectable than the competition. Harmsworth claimed to be motivated by a wish to challenge the pernicious influence of penny dreadfuls. According to an editorial in the first number of &quot;The Half-penny Marvel&quot; in 1893:

&quot;The Half-penny Marvel&quot; was soon followed by other Harmsworth half-penny periodicals, such as &quot;The Union Jack&quot;. At first the stories were high-minded moral tales, reportedly based on true experiences, but it was not long before these papers started using the same kind of material as the publications they competed against. From 1896, the cover of &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot; featured the long-running comic strip of the tramps Weary Willie and Tired Tim, with a young Charlie Chaplin among its readers. A. A. Milne, the author of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, once said, &quot;Harmsworth killed the penny dreadful by the simple process of producing the &#x27;ha&#x27;penny dreadfuller. The quality of the Harmsworth/Amalgamated Press papers began to improve throughout the early 20th century, however. By the time of the First World War, papers such as &quot;Union Jack&quot; dominated the market in the UK.

The penny dreadfuls were also challenged by book series such as The Penny Library of Famous Books launched in 1896 by George Newnes which he characterized as &quot;penny delightfuls&quot; intended to counter the pernicious effects of the penny dreadfuls, and such as the Penny Popular Novels launched in 1896 by W. T. Stead.

==Legacy==

Two popular characters to come out of the penny dreadfuls were Jack Harkaway, introduced in the &quot;Boys of England&quot; in 1871, and Sexton Blake, who began in &quot;the Half-penny Marvel&quot; in 1893. In 1904, the &quot;Union Jack&quot; became &quot;Sexton Blake&#x27;s own paper&quot;, and he appeared in every issue thereafter, up until the paper&#x27;s demise in 1933. In total, Blake appeared in roughly 4,000 adventures, right up into the 1970s. Harkaway was also popular in America and had many imitators.

The fictional Sweeney Todd, the subject of both a successful musical by Stephen Sondheim and a feature film by Tim Burton, first appeared in an 1846/1847 penny dreadful titled &quot;The String of Pearls: A Romance&quot; by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest.

The penny dreadfuls inspired the British comics that began to emerge in the 1870s. Describing penny dreadfuls as &quot;a 19th-century British publishing phenomenon&quot;, the BBC adds, their &quot;very disposability (the booklets&#x27; bargain cover price meant they were printed on exceptionally flimsy paper) has made surviving examples a rarity, despite their immense popularity at the time.&quot;

<text>The Douglas Bay Horse Tramway on the Isle of Man runs along the seafront promenades of Douglas for approximately , from the southern terminus at the Villa Marina, to Derby Castle station, the southern terminus of the Manx Electric Railway, where the workshops and sheds are located. It is a distinctive tourist attraction.

==History==
The tramway was built and initially operated by Thomas Lightfoot, a retired civil engineer from Sheffield. His service was introduced in 1876 between the bottom of what is now Summer Hill and the bottom of Broadway in the centre of today&#x27;s promenade adjacent to the Villa Marina. In the earliest days the track was expanded, and passing loops and long crossovers added so that by 1891 the line ran double track the entire length of the promenade, much as it does today. From opening it has operated every year, except for a period during the Second World War.

In 1882, Lightfoot sold the line to Isle of Man Tramways Ltd, later the Isle of Man Tramways &amp; Electric Power Co. Ltd, which also owned the Manx Electric Railway. The company went into liquidation in 1900 as a consequence of a banking collapse. The tramway was sold by the liquidator to Douglas Corporation in 1902. Since 1927 the tramway has run in summer only.

In 2014 it was announced by the Department of Infrastructure that during 2015 the horse trams would be temporarily suspended while resurfacing work on the promenade continued into its next phase, which runs from Regent Street to Strathallan. However, the plans were later revised, allowing regular horse tram operation to take place in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

In 2015 Douglas Corporation partnered with Isle of Man Transport to introduce the &#x27;Ticketer&#x27; system as used across the Island&#x27;s other public transport systems. On board a Ticketer hand-held unit connects with the island-wide contactless Go Cards and individual tickets can also be purchased.

===Closure===
Despite being the world&#x27;s last remaining 19th century original horse-drawn passenger tramway and the second-oldest operational rail system on the island, the future of the tramway has been brought into question in recent years. In January 2016, Douglas Corporation announced that the tramway had run for the last time the previous September and that they had closed it as it was not financially viable. The tramway had made a loss of £263,000 in 2015.

===Continuance===
After an online petition attracted more than 2,000 signatures, the House of Keys established a committee to look into ways of retaining the iconic horse trams. The operation of the tramway was taken over by the Isle of Man Heritage Railways division of the Department of Infrastructure and continued in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 summer seasons.

Various plans were submitted by the Department of Infrastructure to rebuild the Douglas Promenades. In one version, the tramway would move from its location in the middle of the roadway to a new single line formation adjacent to the Promenade walkway. The plans received some criticism from a group of local residents who objected to the siting of the trams near to the walkway. However, in 2019, the tracks were relaid in their previous alignment along the centre of the road. Trams started running again on Friday 29 July 2022, between Strathallan tram depot and Broadway.

==Description==

The tramway is narrow-gauge, double track throughout, running down the middle of the road. Service is provided by 23 tramcars and some 45 horses. There have been several types of tramcar, and at least one of each type has been retained. Most services are maintained by &quot;closed toastracks&quot;, with winter saloons and open toastracks also in semi-regular service. In summer, trams are stabled outdoors overnight adjacent to the Terminus Tavern public house, and there is a purpose-built tramshed where they are stored in winter.
==Tramcars==
===Fleet===

The remaining core of service trams represent a cross-section of various types of car used on the line over the years; notable exceptions from the current fleet are an umbrella car (one of which survives as a souvenir shop elsewhere) and a convertible car, although one of these survives in private ownership. This was the last of three cars from 1935 which were dubbed &quot;tomato boxes&quot; owing to their unconventional appearance. On 27 August 2016, after Douglas council took ownership, six trams were sold at auction, numbers 28, 33, 34, 37, 39 and 40. Trams notated as rebuilt are considered to be part of the &quot;Heritage Fleet&quot;.

===Scrapped fleet===
The tramway amassed at total of 50 cars, the final three arriving as late as 1935. Over the years several of these became surplus to requirements and were scrapped; many were stored in the former cable car depot at York Road, Douglas prior to its demolition to make way for a residential complex in 1990, others were dismantled being surplus to requirements over the years. Nos. 48 and 50 were purchased for possible use as wayside shelters on the Manx Electric Railway and were stored for a time at Derby Castle; the plan however never came to fruition and both vehicles were scrapped in 1982 leaving No.49 as the sole remaining example of this type of tramcar. No.46 was relocated to Nobles Park in Douglas in 1988 where it saw use as a shelter (memorably it carried a black and neon colour scheme latterly, promoting the Palace Lido); it was removed from the island and fully restored for museum display though later scrapped despite having been heavily reconditioned.

===Other tramcars===
In addition to those cars remaining in the operational fleet, a number have survived and remained at other locations on the island; No. 14 spent several years at the Clapham Transport Museum until its closure, returning to the island in time for the centenary of the tramway in 1976; it entered the Manx Museum in 1991 where it remains today. No. 22 was converted into a souvenir shop used at Strathallan Crescent, it now resides at a transport museum in the north of the island where it fulfils the same role.

<text>Daniel Dumile (born Dumile Daniel Thompson; ; July 13, 1971October 31, 2020), also known by his stage name MF Doom or simply Doom (both stylized in all caps), was a British and American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Noted for his intricate wordplay, signature metal mask, and &quot;supervillain&quot; stage persona, he became a major figure of underground hip hop and alternative hip hop in the 2000s.

Dumile was born in London and raised in Long Beach, New York. He began his career in 1988 as a member of the trio KMD, performing as Zev Love X. The group disbanded in 1993 after the death of DJ Subroc, Dumile&#x27;s brother. After a hiatus, Dumile reemerged in the late 1990s. He began performing at open mic events while wearing a metal mask resembling that of the Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom, who is depicted on the cover of his 1999 debut solo album &quot;&quot;. He adopted the MF Doom persona and rarely made unmasked public appearances thereafter.

During Dumile&#x27;s most prolific period, the early to mid-2000s, he released the acclaimed &quot;Mm..Food&quot; (2004) as MF Doom, as well as albums released under the pseudonyms King Geedorah and Viktor Vaughn. &quot;Madvillainy&quot; (2004), recorded with the producer Madlib under the name Madvillain, is often cited as Dumile&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and is regarded as a landmark album in hip hop. &quot;Madvillainy&quot; was followed by another acclaimed collaboration, &quot;The Mouse and the Mask&quot; (2005), with the producer Danger Mouse, released under the name Danger Doom.

Though he lived most of his life in the United States, Dumile never gained American citizenship; in 2010, he was denied reentry after returning from an international tour for his sixth and final solo album, &quot;Born Like This&quot; (2009). He moved to London before settling in Leeds and worked mostly in collaboration with other artists during his final years, releasing albums with Jneiro Jarel (as JJ Doom), Bishop Nehru (&quot;NehruvianDoom&quot;), and Czarface (&quot;Czarface Meets Metal Face&quot;, and the posthumous &quot;Super What?&quot;). On Halloween 2020, he died in a Leeds hospital from angioedema following a reaction to a blood pressure medication. After his death, &quot;Variety&quot; described him as one of hip hop&#x27;s &quot;most celebrated, unpredictable and enigmatic figures&quot;.

==Early life==
Daniel Dumile was born Dumile Daniel Thompson in the Hounslow district of London on July 13, 1971, the son of a Trinidadian mother and Zimbabwean father. He later said that he was conceived in the United States, where his parents lived, and happened to be born in London because his mother was visiting family there. He had four younger siblings, including fellow rapper DJ Subroc (1973–1993), with whom he formed the rap group KMD until Subroc was struck and killed by a car at the age of 19. As a child, Dumile moved with his family to Long Beach, New York, where he grew up in a black nationalist Muslim household as part of the Nation. He said he had no memory of his London childhood and defined himself as a &quot;New York nigga&quot;, but remained a British citizen his entire life and never gained American citizenship. He began DJing during the summer after third grade. As a child, he was a fan and collector of comic books and earned the nickname &quot;Doom&quot; (a phonetic play on the name Dumile) among friends and family.

==Career==
===1988–1997: KMD, brother&#x27;s death, and hiatus===

Under the name Zev Love X, Dumile formed the hip hop group KMD in 1988 with his younger brother DJ Subroc and Rodan, who was later replaced by Onyx the Birthstone Kid. A&amp;R representative Dante Ross learned of KMD through the hip hop group 3rd Bass and signed them to Elektra Records. Their recording debut came on 3rd Bass&#x27;s song &quot;The Gas Face&quot; on &quot;The Cactus Album&quot;, followed in 1991 by their debut album &quot;Mr. Hood&quot;. Dumile performed the last verse on &quot;The Gas Face&quot;; according to Pete Nice&#x27;s verse on the track, Dumile created the phrase.

On April 23, 1993, just before the release of the second KMD album, &quot;Black Bastards&quot;, Subroc was struck by a car and killed while crossing the Long Island Expressway. Dumile completed the album alone over the course of several months, and it was announced with a release date of May 3, 1994. KMD was dropped by Elektra and the album went unreleased due to its controversial cover art, which featured a cartoon of a stereotypical pickaninny or sambo character being hanged.

After his brother&#x27;s death, Dumile retreated from the hip hop scene from 1994 to 1997, living &quot;damn near homeless, walking the streets of Manhattan, sleeping on benches&quot;. In the late 1990s, he settled in Atlanta; he had moved to Georgia in the mid-90s. According to Dumile, he was &quot;recovering from his wounds&quot; and vowing revenge &quot;against the industry that so badly deformed him&quot;. &quot;Black Bastards&quot; had been bootlegged by that time, but was not officially released until 2000.

===1997–2001: &quot;Operation: Doomsday&quot; and production work===
In 1997 or 1998, Dumile began freestyling incognito at open-mic events at the Nuyorican Poets Café in Manhattan, obscuring his face by putting tights over his head. He turned this into a new identity, MF Doom, with a mask similar to that of Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom. He later adopted a mask based on the one worn by Maximus, the protagonist of the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

Bobbito Garcia&#x27;s Fondle &#x27;Em Records released &quot;&quot;, Dumile&#x27;s first full-length LP as MF Doom, in 1999. Dumile&#x27;s collaborators on &quot;Operation: Doomsday&quot; included fellow members of the Monsta Island Czars collective, for which each artist took on the persona of a monster from the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films. Dumile went by the alias &quot;King Geedorah&quot;, a three-headed golden dragon space monster modeled after King Ghidorah. The album&#x27;s productions sampled cartoons including &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, something that became a staple of his music later on. Jon Caramanica, in a review of &quot;Operation: Doomsday&quot; for &quot;Spin&quot;, emphasized the contrast between Dumile&#x27;s flow as Zev Love X in KMD and his revised approach as a solo artist: &quot;Doom&#x27;s flow is muddy, nowhere near the sprightly rhymes of KMD&#x27;s early days, and his thought process is haphazard.&quot; Caramanica revisited &quot;Operation: Doomsday&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2021, calling it &quot;one of the most idiosyncratic hip-hop albums of the 1990s, and one of the defining documents of the independent hip-hop explosion of that decade&quot;. Cyril Cordor, in a review for &quot;AllMusic&quot;, described &quot;Operation: Doomsday&quot; as Dumile&#x27;s &quot;rawest&quot; lyrical effort.

In 2001, Dumile began releasing his &quot;Special Herbs&quot; instrumentals series under the pseudonym Metal Fingers. In a review of a 2011 box set containing ten volumes of the &quot;Special Herbs&quot; series, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; observed that the instrumentals stand on their own without vocal tracks: &quot;most of these tracks sound plenty &#x27;finished&#x27; even in rhyme-less form&quot;.

===2002–2004: King Geedorah, Viktor Vaughn, and &quot;Madvillainy&quot;===
In 2003, Dumile released the album &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot; under his King Geedorah moniker. In &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Mark Martelli described &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot; as close to a concept album, noting how it lays out the &quot;mythos&quot; of the eponymous King Geedorah. Martelli praised the album, particularly tracks such as &quot;One Smart Nigger&quot; which, in his view, were superior to other artists&#x27; attempts at political hip hop. &quot;Fact&quot;, in a brief notice for a 2013 reissue of &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;, called it &quot;arguably the most cinematic&quot; of Dumile&#x27;s albums from the turn of the 21st century.

Later in 2003, Dumile released the LP &quot;Vaudeville Villain&quot; under the moniker Viktor Vaughn (another play on Doctor Doom, who is also known as Victor von Doom). &quot;NME&quot; described the Viktor Vaughn persona as &quot;a time travelling street hustler&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Vaudeville Villain&quot; the week&#x27;s best new album and highlighted its lyricism, writing that Dumile was one of the best writers in rap.

Dumile&#x27;s breakthrough came in 2004 with the album &quot;Madvillainy&quot;, created with producer Madlib under the group name Madvillain. They recorded the album in a series of sessions over two years before a commercial release on March 23, 2004. &quot;Madvillainy&quot; was a critical and commercial success, and has since become known as Dumile&#x27;s masterpiece.

Also in 2004, Dumile released &quot;&quot;, a follow-up LP under the Viktor Vaughn moniker. Nathan Rabin noted in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; that &quot;VV:2&quot;, coming as it did after the commercial and critical success of &quot;Madvillainy&quot;, represented an unusual career choice for Dumile whereby he went &quot;deeper underground&quot; instead of embracing wider fame.

Later in 2004, the second MF Doom album &quot;Mm..Food&quot; was released by Rhymesayers Entertainment. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a positive review. Nathan Rabin described it as a &quot;crazy pastiche&quot; but argued that it grew more coherent on repeated listening.

Around this time, he also appeared in a voice role in the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot; as Sherman the giraffe.

===2005–2009: Danger Doom, &quot;Born Like This&quot;, and Ghostface collaboration===
Although still an independent artist, Dumile took a bigger step towards the mainstream in 2005 with &quot;The Mouse and the Mask&quot;, a collaboration with the producer DJ Danger Mouse under the group name Danger Doom. The album, released on October 11, 2005, by Epitaph and Lex, was developed in collaboration with Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim and featured voice actors and characters from its programs (mostly &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;). &quot;The Mouse and the Mask&quot; reached #41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Critic Chris Vognar, discussing the role of comedy in hip hop, argued that &quot;Doom and Danger exemplify an absurdist strain in recent independent hip-hop, a willingness to embrace the nerdy without a heavy cloak of irony&quot;. In the same year, Dumile appeared on the second Gorillaz album, &quot;Demon Days.&quot;

Dumile produced tracks for both of Ghostface Killah&#x27;s 2006 albums &quot;Fishscale&quot; and &quot;More Fish&quot;. In February 2013, Ghostface Killah said that he and Dumile were in the process of choosing tracks for a collaborative album. In 2015, Ghostface Killah announced that the album, &quot;Swift &amp; Changeable&quot;, would be released in 2016, and later posted promotional artwork for the collaboration. It remains unreleased.

Dumile&#x27;s &quot;Born Like This&quot; was released on Lex Records on March 24, 2009. The album was Dumile&#x27;s first solo album to chart in the US. In a largely favorable review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Nate Patrin cast the album as a return to form for Dumile, following a period of limited output. He observed that Dumile&#x27;s lyrics and flow—&quot;a focused rasp that&#x27;s subtly grown slightly more ragged and intense&quot;—were darker than on earlier records. He also highlighted the overtly homophobic &quot;Batty Boyz&quot;, a diss track against unnamed rappers. Steve Yates, reviewing the album in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, likewise saw &quot;Born Like This&quot; as hearkening back to Dumile&#x27;s earlier output. Yates felt it presented Dumile at &quot;his scalpel-tongued, scatter-mouthed best&quot;. Both Patrin and Yates noted the influence of Charles Bukowski on &quot;Born Like This&quot;: the first line of Bukowski&#x27;s poem &quot;Dinosauria, We&quot; gives the album its title.

===2010–2021: Move to UK and later collaborations===

In early 2010, Dumile released the EP &quot;Gazzillion Ear&quot; on Lex, a compilation of remixes of &quot;Gazzillion Ear&quot; from &quot;Born Like This,&quot; including a remix by Thom Yorke and two mixes by Jneiro Jarel. A further remix by Madvillain featuring a voicemail message from Kanye West was released online. The EP coincided with Dumile&#x27;s first performances outside North America. On March 5, 2010, Lex and Sónar presented the first Doom show in London, at the Roundhouse in Camden. &quot;Expektoration&quot;, Dumile&#x27;s second live album, was released on September 14, 2010, through Gold Dust. In a review of &quot;Expektoration&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that Dumile&#x27;s vocal performance was more energetic than on his recordings, which it characterized as &quot;laidback&quot; by comparison.

After completing his European tour, Dumile was refused re-entry into the United States. He settled in the UK in 2010. &quot;Key to the Kuffs&quot;, an album Dumile made in collaboration with the producer Jneiro Jarel as JJ Doom, was released on August 20, 2012, and included guest features from Damon Albarn, Beth Gibbons of Portishead, Khujo Goodie of Goodie Mob and Dungeon Family, and Boston Fielder. Reviews of &quot;Key to the Kuffs&quot; in &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Fact&quot; emphasized its references to Dumile&#x27;s &quot;exile&quot; in the United Kingdom, while &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; noted its play on Britishisms in tracks like &quot;Guv&#x27;nor&quot;.

&quot;NehruvianDoom&quot;, Dumile&#x27;s collaboration with the rapper Bishop Nehru, was released on October 7, 2014. Dumile produced all the tracks on &quot;NehruvianDoom&quot;, often using beats developed in the &quot;Special Herbs&quot; series; vocals are primarily Nehru&#x27;s, with some contributions from Dumile. The album was Nehru&#x27;s major label debut. The limitations of Nehru&#x27;s artistic achievement on the album were stressed by critics due to his relative youth (he was still in his teens when the album was produced) and the album&#x27;s briefness, lasting just over 30 minutes. Dumile&#x27;s contributions were also seen as limited: &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that he often seemed on &quot;autopilot&quot;, and &quot;XXL&quot; suggested that neither he nor Nehru were able to &quot;push the envelope&quot;.

In August 2017, Adult Swim announced a Doom compilation, &quot;The Missing Notebook Rhymes&quot;, that would consist of songs from his upcoming projects and featured appearances on other artists&#x27; songs. The Adult Swim website was to release one new song per week over the course of 15 weeks. However, the arrangement was canceled in September after the release of only seven tracks.

In February 2018, Dumile and Czarface released &quot;Nautical Depth&quot;, the first single from their collaborative album &quot;Czarface Meets Metal Face&quot;. The album was released on March 30, 2018. In a lukewarm review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Mehan Jayasuriya compared verses by Open Mike Eagle favorably to Dumile&#x27;s, but noted that Dumile&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Nautical Depth&quot; exhibited his &quot;once razor-sharp lyricism&quot;. Ben Beaumont-Thomas, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, was more positive, noting Dumile&#x27;s &quot;stoner surrealism&quot; in &quot;Captain Crunch&quot;.

Aside from the album with Czarface, Dumile&#x27;s musical output in the final three years of his life was limited to one-off guest appearances on other artists&#x27; tracks. Posthumous releases included appearances on two songs for the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot;: &quot;Lunch Break&quot;, with Flying Lotus; and &quot;The Chocolate Conquistadors&quot;, with BadBadNotGood, made for the game&#x27;s content update &quot;The Cayo Perico Heist.&quot; Shortly after Dumile&#x27;s death was announced, Flying Lotus revealed that they had been working on an EP. Having been completed in early 2020 but later delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dumile&#x27;s second collaborative album with Czarface and first posthumous release, &quot;Super What?&quot;, was released in May 2021.

== Style and artistry ==
Dumile&#x27;s lyrics are known for wordplay. Bradley and DuBois, describing Dumile as &quot;among the most enigmatic figures in hip-hop&quot;, wrote that Dumile&#x27;s &quot;raspy baritone weaves an intricate web of allusions drawn from comic books and metaphysics along with seeming nonsense and non sequiturs&quot;. According to an obituary in &quot;The Ringer&quot;, his flow was &quot;loose and conversational, but delivered with technical precision&quot;, and his use of rhyme and meter eclipsed that of Big Pun and Eminem.

Dumile&#x27;s production work frequently incorporated samples and quotations from film. A review of &quot;Special Herbs&quot; volumes 5 and 6 in &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; compared Dumile&#x27;s beats to &quot;soul jazz&quot;.

===MF Doom persona===
Dumile created the MF Doom character as an alter ego with a backstory he could reference in his music. The character combines elements from the Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom, Destro, and the Phantom of the Opera; like Doctor Doom and Phantom, Dumile referred to himself in the third person while in character. His signature mask was similar to that of Doctor Doom, who is depicted rapping on the cover of Dumile&#x27;s 1999 debut album &quot;&quot;.

Dumile wore the mask while performing, and would not be photographed without it, except for short glimpses in videos and in earlier photos with KMD. Later versions of the mask were based on a prop from the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Academic Hershini Bhana Young argued that, by appropriating the Doctor Doom mask, Dumile &quot;positions himself as enemy, not only of the music industry but also of dominant constructions of identity that relegate him as a black man to second-class citizenship&quot;.

Dumile sometimes sent stand-ins to perform in the mask, which he saw as a &quot;logical extension&quot; of the concept but angered audiences. Dumile initially claimed that he had lost weight and thus looked and sounded different. At a 2010 show in Toronto, an imposter was booed off stage before being replaced by Dumile. In an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Dumile described himself as the &quot;writer and director&quot; of the character and that he &quot;might send a white dude next ... Whoever plays the character plays the character.&quot;

In November 2019, during his performance at the Adult Swim Festival, the electronic artist Flying Lotus announced that he would be joined onstage by Dumile. Instead, the masked figure who appeared on stage was revealed as the comedian Hannibal Buress. Dumile&#x27;s involvement in the prank was not confirmed.

==Legacy and influence==

Dumile was celebrated in independent hip hop. After his death, the producer Flying Lotus wrote of &quot;Madvillainy&quot;: &quot;All u ever needed in hip-hop was this record. Sorted. Done. Give it to the fucking aliens.&quot; The English musician Thom Yorke, who twice collaborated with Dumile, wrote: &quot;He was a massive inspiration to so many of us, changed things... For me the way he put words was often shocking in its genius, using stream of consciousness in a way I&#x27;d never heard before.&quot; &quot;Stereogum&quot;, reviewing &quot;Operation: Doomsday&quot; on its 20th anniversary, noted Dumile&#x27;s &quot;formative&quot; influence on younger rappers. El-P of Run the Jewels described him as a &quot;writer&#x27;s writer&quot;, while Q-Tip called him &quot;your favorite rapper&#x27;s favorite rapper&quot;. A biography by S.H. Fernando, &quot;The Chronicles of Doom: Unraveling Rap&#x27;s Masked Iconoclast&quot;, is scheduled for October 29, 2024.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
Dumile was married to his wife, Jasmine, for an unknown period until his death in October 2020. They had five children together. In late 2017, his son Malachi died from unspecified causes at the age of 14.

=== Views ===
Dumile&#x27;s worldview was informed by Islam and the Afrocentrism espoused by African-American Muslims. His parents raised him and his brother as Muslims in the Five-Percent Nation, a religious black nationalist movement influenced by Islam. Dumile&#x27;s father taught him about pan-African history, including historical figures such as Marcus Garvey and Elijah Muhammad, which he strove to impart on his peers. 

By the early 1990s, Dumile and the other members of KMD identified as a member of the Ansaar Allah Community, later known as the Nuwaubian Nation. In their music, the members of KMD professed a religious message based on tenets of Nuwaubianism, which Dumile distinguished from Five-Percent beliefs in an early interview. In the music video for &quot;Peachfuzz&quot;, Dumile and the other members of KMD wear kufi caps. By 2000, though he was no longer as strictly observant, Dumile still participated in Nuwaubian events such as the Savior&#x27;s Day celebration at the Tama-Re compound in Georgia and held a positive opinion of the community.

=== Citizenship ===
Although Dumile lived in the United States for most of his life, he never gained citizenship and remained solely a British citizen. He acquired a British passport prior to his 2010 European tour, and was refused re-entry to the United States after completing the tour later that year. It was only his second international tour, and he had previously avoided leaving the United States; he had believed he would be able to secure re-entry based on his long-term residency and family connections. The denial of re-entry forced him apart from his wife and children, and for nearly two years, he saw them only via video calls or during their brief visits to the United Kingdom. They were reunited when his family moved to London in 2012, after which he declared himself &quot;done with the United States&quot;. He spent years living in Yorkshire, and was living in Leeds at the time of his death.

==Death==
In October 2020, Dumile was admitted to St James&#x27;s University Hospital in Leeds with respiratory problems. On October 31, he died from angioedema, an adverse reaction to blood pressure medication he had recently been prescribed. He had suffered from high blood pressure and kidney disease. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, his wife Jasmine was not allowed to visit him in the hospital until the day of his death. His death was unknown to the public for two months until Jasmine announced it on December 31, and the cause of death was not revealed until July 2023.

Many musicians paid tribute to Dumile. His 2004 instrumental track &quot;Coffin Nails&quot; was included on U.S. president Joe Biden&#x27;s inauguration playlist in January 2021, which was criticized by fans of Dumile as Biden was the vice president in 2010 when Dumile was refused re-entry to the United States.

<text>The Quinisext Council (; , literally meaning, &quot;Fifth Meeting&quot;), i.e., the Fifth-Sixth Council, often called the Council &quot;in Trullo&quot;, Trullan Council, or the Penthekte Synod, was a church council held in 692 at Constantinople under Justinian II.

The synod is known as the &quot;Council &quot;in Trullo&quot;&quot; because, like the Sixth Ecumenical Council, it was held in a domed hall in the Imperial Palace ( [], meaning a cup or dome). Both the Fifth and the Sixth Ecumenical Councils had omitted to draw up disciplinary canons, and as this council was intended to complete both in this respect, it took the name of Quinisext.

==Decisions==
Many of the council&#x27;s canons were reiterations. It endorsed not only the six ecumenical councils already held (canon 1), but also:

* the 85 Apostolic Canons,
* the Synod of Ancyra
* the Synod of Neocaesarea,
* the Synod of Gangra,
* the Synod of Antioch in 341,
* the Council of Serdica,
* the Synod of Laodicea,
* Councils of Carthage,
* the Council of Constantinople (394)

The council also confirmed authority of Church Fathers:

* 4 canons of Pope Dionysius of Alexandria,
* 12 canons of Gregory Thaumaturgus,
* 15 canons of Peter I of Alexandria,
* 3 canons of Athanasius of Alexandria [including 39th Festal Letter of Athanasius (canon 2)],
* 18 canons of Timothy I of Alexandria,
* 92 canons of Basil of Caesarea,
* 1 canon of Gregory of Nazianzus,
* 8 canons of Gregory of Nyssa,
* 1 canon of Amphilochius of Iconium,

===Ban on pre-Christian practices===
The Council banned certain festivals and practices which were thought to have a Pagan origin. Therefore, the Council gives some insight to historians about pre-Christian religious practices. As a consequence, neither cleric nor layman was allowed to observe the Pagan festivals of Bota, the Kalends or the Brumalia.

===Ritual observance===
Many of the council&#x27;s canons were aimed at settling differences in ritual observance and clerical discipline in different parts of Christendom. Being held under Byzantine auspices, with an exclusively Eastern clergy, these overwhelmingly took the practice of the Church of Constantinople as orthodox.

====Armenian practices====
The council explicitly condemned some customs of Armenian Christians; among them using wine unmixed with water for the Eucharist, choosing children of clergy for appointment as clergy, and eating eggs and cheese on Saturdays and Sundays of Lent. And the council proclaimed deposition for clergy and excommunication for laypeople who contravened the canons prohibiting these practices.

====Roman (western) practices====
Likewise, it reprobated, with similar penalties, the Latin custom of not allowing married men to be ordained to the diaconate or priesthood unless they vowed for perpetual continence and living separately from their wives, and fasting on Saturdays of Lent. Nevertheless, it also prescribed continence during those times when serving at the altar. Without contrasting with the practice of the Western Church, it also prescribed that the celebration of the Eucharist in Lent should only happen in Saturdays, Sundays, and the feast of the Annunciation.

====Eucharist, liturgy, evangelising, baptism====
Grapes, milk and honey were not to be offered at the altar. Whoever came to receive the Eucharist should receive in the hand by holding his hands in the form of a cross. The Eucharist was not allowed to be given to dead bodies. During the liturgy the psalms were to be sung in modest and dulcet tones, and the phrase &#x27;who was crucified for us&#x27; was not to be added to the Trisagion. Prelates were to preach the gospel as propounded by the fathers. Priests received special instructions on how to deal with those who were not baptized and they were also given rubrics to follow on how to admit heretics to the faith.

===Moral guidelines for clerics and laity===
In addition to these, the council also condemned clerics that had improper or illicit relations with women. It condemned simony and the charging of fees for administering the Eucharist. It enjoined those in holy orders from entering public houses, engaging in usurious practices, attending horse races in the Hippodrome, wearing unsuitable clothes or celebrating the liturgy in private homes (&quot;eukterion&quot;) without the consent of their bishops. Both clergy and laity were forbidden from gambling with dice, attending theatrical performances, or consulting soothsayers. No one was allowed to own a house of prostitution, engage in abortion, arrange hair in ornate plaits or to promote pornography. It also ordered law students at the University of Constantinople to cease wearing &quot;clothing contrary to the general custom&quot;. Consumption of any blood either directly or through meat was prohibited on pain of deposition and excommunication for clergy, and excommunication for laity.

==Acceptance==
Pope Sergius I refused to sign the decrees of the Quinisext Council when they were sent to him, rejecting them as &quot;lacking authority&quot; and describing them as containing &quot;novel errors.&quot; Efforts to compel his signature were ultimately unsuccessful.

During the pontificate of Pope Constantine, a compromise approach appears to have been taken. This position was later articulated in the ninth century by Pope John VIII, who stated that he &quot;accepted all those canons which did not contradict the true faith, good morals, and the decrees of Rome.&quot;

Nearly a century later, Pope Hadrian I explicitly recognized the Trullan decrees in a letter to Tenasius of Constantinople, attributing them to the Sixth Synod. He affirmed: &quot;All the holy six synods I receive with all their canons, which rightly and divinely were promulgated by them, among which is contained that in which reference is made to a Lamb being pointed to by the Precursor as being found in certain of the venerable images.&quot;

<text>From Gardens Where We Feel Secure is the debut album by English musician Virginia Astley, issued on 29 July 1983 on her own label Happy Valley Records and distributed by Rough Trade Records.

The album is an instrumental collection of tone poems that describe the cycle and mirror the moods of an &quot;indolent&quot; summer day. It is notable for its structure, moving from dawn to dusk, and its use of natural sound effects, over which co-producer Russell Webb recorded Astley&#x27;s improvised playing.

&quot;From Gardens Where We Feel Secure&quot; peaked at number four on the UK Independent Albums chart. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, two of its tracks, &quot;A Summer Long Since Past&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Too Hot to Sleep&quot;, were issued on the 12&quot; edition of Astley&#x27;s single &quot;Love&#x27;s a Lonely Place to Be&quot;.

Astley later re-recorded &quot;A Summer Long Since Past&quot; for her 1986 album &quot;Hope in a Darkened Heart&quot;. &quot;From Gardens Where We Feel Secure&quot; was remastered and reissued by Happy Valley and Rough Trade as a CD in 2003.

An alternate cover shows a photograph of Cowleaze Wood covered in bluebells, a 70-acre woodland in the Chiltern Hills, England.

<doc id="923015" wikidata="Q1092582" url="?curid=923015" title="Theory of descriptions">
<text>The theory of descriptions is the philosopher Bertrand Russell&#x27;s most significant contribution to the philosophy of language. It is also known asRussell&#x27;s theory of descriptions (commonly abbreviated as RTD). In short, Russell argued that the syntactic form of descriptions (phrases that took the form of &quot;The flytrap&quot; and &quot;A flytrap&quot;) is misleading, as it does not correlate their logical and/or semantic architecture. While descriptions may seem like fairly uncontroversial phrases, Russell argued that providing a satisfactory analysis of the linguistic and logical properties of a description is vital to clarity in important philosophical debates, particularly in semantic arguments, epistemology and metaphysical elements.

Since the first development of the theory in Russell&#x27;s 1905 paper &quot;On Denoting&quot;, RTD has been hugely influential and well-received within the philosophy of language. However, it has not been without its critics. In particular, the philosophers P. F. Strawson and Keith Donnellan have given notable, well known criticisms of the theory. Most recently, RTD has been defended by various philosophers and even developed in promising ways to bring it into harmony with generative grammar in Noam Chomsky&#x27;s sense, particularly by Stephen Neale. Such developments have themselves been criticised, and debate continues.

Russell viewed his theory of descriptions as a kind of analysis that is now called propositional analysis (not to be confused with propositional calculus).

==Overview==
Bertrand Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions was initially put forth in his 1905 essay &quot;On Denoting&quot;, published in the journal of philosophy &quot;Mind&quot;. Russell&#x27;s theory is focused on the logical form of expressions involving denoting phrases, which he divides into three groups:

# Denoting phrases which do not denote anything, for example &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky&quot;.
# Phrases which denote one definite object, for example &quot;the present President of the U.S.A.&quot; We need not know which object the phrase refers to for it to be unambiguous, for example &quot;the cutest kitten&quot; is a unique individual but his or her actual identity is unknown.
# Phrases which denote ambiguously, for example, &quot;a flytrap&quot;.

&quot;Indefinite descriptions&quot; constitute Russell&#x27;s third group. Descriptions most frequently appear in the standard subject–predicate form.

Russell put forward his theory of descriptions to solve a number of problems in the philosophy of language. The two major problems are (1) co-referring expressions and (2) non-referring expressions.

The problem of co-referring expressions originated primarily with Gottlob Frege as the problem of informative identities. For example, if the morning star and the evening star are the same planet in the sky seen at different times of day (indeed, they are both the planet Venus: the morning star is the planet Venus seen in the morning sky and the evening star is the planet Venus seen in the evening sky), how is it that someone can think that the morning star rises in the morning but the evening star does not? This is apparently problematic because although the two expressions seem to denote the same thing, one cannot substitute one for the other, which one ought to be able to do with identical or synonymous expressions.

The problem of non-referring expressions is that certain expressions that are meaningful do not truly refer to anything. For example, by &quot;any dog is annoying&quot; it is not meant that there is a particular individual dog, namely &quot;any dog&quot;, that has the property of being annoying (similar considerations go for &quot;some dog&quot;, &quot;every dog&quot;, &quot;a dog&quot;, and so on). Likewise, by &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray&quot; it is not meant that there is some individual, namely &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky &quot;, who has the property of being gray; Kentucky was never a monarchy, so there is currently no Emperor. Thus, what Russell wants to avoid is admitting mysterious non-existent objects into his ontology. Furthermore, the law of the excluded middle requires that one of the following propositions, for example, must be true: either &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray&quot; or &quot;it is not the case that the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray&quot;. Normally, propositions of the subject-predicate form are said to be true if and only if the subject is in the extension of the predicate. But, there is currently no Emperor of Kentucky. So, since the subject does not exist, it is not in the extension of either predicate (it is not on the list of gray people or non-gray people). Thus, it appears that this is a case in which the law of excluded middle is violated, which is also an indication that something has gone wrong.

==Definite descriptions==

Russell analyzes definite descriptions similarly to indefinite descriptions, except that the individual is now uniquely specified. Take as an example of a definite description the sentence &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray&quot;. Russell analyses this phrase into the following component parts (with &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; representing variables):

#there is an x such that x is an emperor of Kentucky.
#for every x and every y, if both x and y are emperors of Kentucky, then y is x (i.e. there is at most one emperor of Kentucky).
#anything that is an emperor of Kentucky is gray.

Thus, a definite description (of the general form &#x27;the F is G&#x27;) becomes the following existentially quantified phrase in classic symbolic logic (where &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; are variables and &#x27;F&#x27; and &#x27;G&#x27; are predicates – in the example above, F would be &quot;is an emperor of Kentucky&quot;, and G would be &quot;is gray&quot;):

:formula_1

Informally, this reads as follows: something exists with the property F, there is only one such thing, and this unique thing also has the property G.

This analysis, according to Russell, solves the two problems noted above as related to definite descriptions:
# &quot;The morning star rises in the morning&quot; no longer needs to be thought of as having the subject-predicate form. It is instead analysed as &quot;there is one unique thing such that it is the morning star and it rises in the morning&quot;. Thus, strictly speaking, the two expressions &quot;the morning star...&quot; and &quot;the evening star...&quot; are not synonymous, so it makes sense that they cannot be substituted (the analysed description of the evening star is &quot;there is one unique thing such that it is the evening star and it rises in the evening&quot;). This solves Gottlob Frege&#x27;s problem of informative identities.
# Since the phrase &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray&quot; is not a referring expression, according to Russell&#x27;s theory it need not refer to a mysterious non-existent entity. Russell says that if there are no entities X with property F, the proposition &quot;X has property G&quot; is false for &quot;all&quot; values of X.

Russell says that all propositions in which the Emperor of Kentucky has a primary occurrence are false. The denials of such propositions are true, but in these cases the Emperor of Kentucky has a secondary occurrence (the truth value of the proposition is not a function of the truth of the existence of the Emperor of Kentucky).

==Indefinite descriptions==
Take as an example of an indefinite description the sentence &quot;some dog is annoying&quot;. Russell analyses this phrase into the following component parts (with &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; representing variables):

*There is an x such that:
#x is a dog; and
#x is being annoying.

Thus, an indefinite description (of the general form &#x27;a D is A&#x27;) becomes the following existentially quantified phrase in classic symbolic logic (where &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; are variables and &#x27;D&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; are predicates):

:formula_2

Informally, this reads as follows: there is something such that it is D and A.

This analysis, according to Russell, solves the second problem noted above as related to indefinite descriptions. Since the phrase &quot;some dog is annoying&quot; is not a referring expression, according to Russell&#x27;s theory, it need not refer to a mysterious non-existent entity. Furthermore, the law of excluded middle need not be violated (i.e. it remains a law), because &quot;some dog is annoying&quot; comes out true: there is a thing that is both a dog and annoying. Thus, Russell&#x27;s theory seems to be a better analysis insofar as it solves several problems.

==Criticism of Russell&#x27;s analysis==

===P. F. Strawson===
P. F. Strawson argued that Russell had failed to correctly represent what one means when one says a sentence in the form of &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray.&quot; According to Strawson, this sentence is not contradicted by &quot;No one is the current Emperor of Kentucky&quot;, for the former sentence contains not an existential assertion, but attempts to &quot;use&quot; &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky&quot; as a referring (or denoting) phrase. Since there is no current Emperor of Kentucky, the phrase fails to refer to anything, and so the sentence is neither true nor false.

Another kind of counter-example that Strawson and philosophers since have raised concerns that of &quot;incomplete&quot; definite descriptions, that is sentences which have the form of a definite description but which do not uniquely denote an object. Strawson gives the example &quot;the table is covered with books&quot;. Under Russell&#x27;s theory, for such a sentence to be true there would have to be only one table in all of existence. But by uttering a phrase such as &quot;the table is covered with books&quot;, the speaker is referring to a particular table: for instance, one that is in the vicinity of the speaker. Two broad responses have been constructed to this failure: a semantic and a pragmatic approach. The semantic approach of philosophers like Stephen Neale suggests that the sentence does in fact have the appropriate meaning as to make it true. Such meaning is added to the sentence by the particular context of the speaker—that, say, the context of standing next to a table &quot;completes&quot; the sentence. Ernie Lepore suggests that this approach treats &quot;definite descriptions as harboring hidden indexical expressions, so that whatever descriptive meaning alone leaves unfinished its context of use can complete&quot;.

Pragmatist responses deny this intuition and say instead that the sentence itself, following Russell&#x27;s analysis, is not true but that the act of uttering the false sentence communicated true information to the listener.

===Keith Donnellan===
According to Keith Donnellan, there are two distinct ways we may use a definite description such as &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray&quot;, and thus makes his distinction between the referential and the attributive use of a definite description. He argues that both Russell and Strawson make the mistake of attempting to analyse sentences removed from their context. We can mean different and distinct things while using the same sentence in different situations.

For example, suppose Smith has been brutally murdered. When the person who discovers Smith&#x27;s body says, &quot;Smith&#x27;s murderer is insane&quot;, we may understand this as the attributive use of the definite description &quot;Smith&#x27;s murderer&quot;, and analyse the sentence according to Russell. This is because the discoverer might equivalently have worded the assertion, &quot;Whoever killed Smith is insane.&quot; Now consider another speaker: suppose Jones, though innocent, has been arrested for the murder of Smith, and is now on trial. When a reporter sees Jones talking to himself outside the courtroom, and describes what she sees by saying, &quot;Smith&#x27;s murderer is insane&quot;, we may understand this as the referring use of the definite description, for we may equivalently reword the reporter&#x27;s assertion thus: &quot;That person who I see talking to himself, and who I believe murdered Smith, is insane.&quot; In this case, we should not accept Russell&#x27;s analysis as correctly representing the reporter&#x27;s assertion. On Russell&#x27;s analysis, the sentence is to be understood as an existential quantification of the conjunction of three components:

*There is an x such that:
#x murdered Smith;
#there is no y, y not equal x, such that y murdered Smith; and
#x is insane.

If this analysis of the reporter&#x27;s assertion were correct, then since Jones is innocent, we should take her to mean what the discoverer of Smith&#x27;s body meant, that whoever murdered Smith is insane. We should then take her observation of Jones talking to himself to be irrelevant to the truth of her assertion. This clearly misses her point.

Thus the same sentence, &quot;Smith&#x27;s murderer is insane&quot;, can be used to mean quite different things in different contexts. There are, accordingly, contexts in which &quot;the current Emperor of Kentucky is not gray&quot; is false because no one is the current Emperor of Kentucky, and contexts in which it is a sentence referring to a person whom the speaker takes to be the current Emperor of Kentucky, true or false according to the of the pretender.

===Saul Kripke===
In &quot;Reference and Existence&quot;, Saul Kripke argues that while Donnellan is correct to point out two uses of the phrase, it does not follow that the phrase is ambiguous between two meanings. For example, when the reporter &quot;finds out&quot; that Jones, the person she has been calling &quot;Smith&#x27;s murderer&quot; did not murder Smith, she will admit that her use of the name was incorrect. Kripke defends Russell&#x27;s analysis of definite descriptions, and argues that Donnellan does not adequately distinguish meaning from use, or, speaker&#x27;s meaning from sentence meaning.

===Other Objections===
The theory of descriptions is regarded as a redundant and cumbersome method. The theory claims that ‘The present King of France is bald’ means ‘One and only one entity is the present King of France, and that one is bald’. L. Susan Stebbing suggests that if ‘that’ is used referentially, ‘that one is bald’ is logically equivalent to the entire conjunction. Hence, the conjunction of three propositions is unnecessary as one proposition is already adequate.

P. T. Geach maintains that Russell&#x27;s theory commits the fallacy of too many questions. Such a sentence as &quot;The present President of Sealand is bald&quot; involves two questions: (1) Is anybody at the moment a President of Sealand ? (2) Are there at the moment different people each of whom is a President of Sealand? Unless the answer to 1 is affirmative and the answer to 2 negative, the affirmative answer &quot; yes, the President of Sealand is bald &quot; is not false but indeterminate. In addition, Russell&#x27;s theory involves unnecessary logical complications.

Furthermore, Honcques Laus contends that Russell&#x27;s analysis involves an error in the truth value that all sentences can be either true or false. Russell&#x27;s nonacceptance of multiple-valued logic makes himself unable to assign a proper truth value to unverifiable and unfalsifiable sentences and causes the puzzle of the laws of thought. The third truth value, namely ‘indeterminate’ or ‘undefined’ should be accepted in the event that both truth and falsity are absent or inapplicable.

William G. Lycan argues that Russell&#x27;s theory intrinsically applies solely to one extraordinary subclass of singular terms but an adequate solution to the puzzles must be generalized. His theory merely addresses the principal use of the definite article &quot;the&quot;, but fails to deal with plural uses or the generic use. Russell also fails to consider anaphoric uses of singular referential expressions.

Arthur Pap argues that the theory of descriptions must be rejected because according to the theory of descriptions, &#x27;the present king of France is bald&#x27; and &#x27;the present king of France is not bald&#x27; are both false and not contradictories otherwise the law of excluded middle would be violated.

<doc id="923018" wikidata="Q2139959" url="?curid=923018" title="Contact patch">
<text>The contact patch is the portion of a vehicle&#x27;s tire that is in actual contact with the road surface. It is commonly used in the discussion of pneumatic (i.e. pressurized) tires, where the term is used strictly to describe the portion of the tire&#x27;s tread that touches the road surface. The term “footprint” is used almost synonymously. Solid wheels also exhibit a contact patch which is generally smaller than the pneumatic “footprint”.

==Contact patch size==
The contact patch is the only connection between the road and the vehicle.

===Pneumatic rubber tires===
The size and shape of the contact patch, as well as the pressure distribution within the contact patch, are important to the ride qualities and handling characteristics of a vehicle. Since the wear characteristics of tires is a highly competitive area between tire manufacturers, a lot of the research done concerning the contact patch is considered highly proprietary and, therefore, very little is published on the subject.

Because pneumatic tires are flexible, the contact patch can be different when the vehicle is in motion than when it is static. Because it is so much easier to make observations of the contact patch without the tire in motion, it is more common to conduct studies of the static contact patch.

Statically, the size, shape, and pressure distribution are functions of many things, the most important of which are the load on the tire and the inflation pressure:

* The larger the load on the tire, the larger the contact patch. 
* The larger the inflation pressure, the smaller the contact patch.

These two properties are not linearly proportional to the area of the contact. For example, a 10% change in load or inflation pressure usually does not result in a 10% change in the contact patch area because the load or pressure on a tire can be altered freely, and the contact patch area is affected by the tire geometry and stiffness. Further, the size of the contact patch cannot be simply calculated as load divided by inflation pressure, and the average contact pressure a tire has with the road surface is not equal to the inflation pressure.

===Solid tires===
The contact patch size of solid materials is described by the equations of contact mechanics. It is mainly related to the stiffness of the material in terms of Young&#x27;s modulus.

===Railroad steel wheel on rail===
The contact patch of a railroad wheel is much smaller than for pneumatic rubber tires; it is only about the size of a dime (252 mm2).

<doc id="923021" wikidata="Q1192238" url="?curid=923021" title="Datia">
<text>Datia, also known as Daityavakra is the district headquarter of the Datia District in north central Madhya Pradesh, a state of Central India. It is an ancient town, mentioned in the Mahabharata ruled by King Dantavakra. The city is 71 km from Gwalior, 325 km south of New Delhi and 344 km north of Bhopal. About 18 km from Datia is Sonagiri, a sacred Jaina hill. Datia is also about 52 km from Orchha. The nearest airport is at Gwalior. It was formerly the seat of the eponymous princely state in the British Raj. Datia is situated near Gwalior and on the border with Uttar Pradesh.

The old town is encircled by a stone wall and is home to gorgeous buildings and gardens. The 17th-century palace of Vir Singh Deo is a notable example of the Hindu architecture of North India. The town serves as a trading center for grains and cotton products. Handloom weaving is an important industry. Datia has several important landmarks and is famous for the seven-story up and seven-story down palace built by Raja Vir Singh Deo in 1614. The town is also a thriving pilgrimage spot for religious devotees. There are many temples, including the Sidhapeeth of Pitambara Devi, Buglamukhi Devi Temple, and Gupteshwar Temple. Pitambara Peeth is a famous Shakta pitha located at the entrance of Datia. This pilgrimage spot is located about 1 km from Datia Bus Station and 3 km from Datia Railway Station on the Delhi-Chennai main line and features Buglamukhi Devi Temple. The Dhumavati Main Temple, established by Golokwasi Swamiji Maharaj and the Vankhandeshwar temple, a Mahabharat period temple of Shiva are the main attraction of the place. It was ruled by Bundela Rajputs until 1947.

==History==

The state was founded in 1626 by Bundela Rajputs. Rao Bhagwan Rao, 1st Rao of Datia and Baroni 1626/1656, received Datia and Baroni from his father, Raja Bir Singh Deo of Orchha in 1626, and established his own state. After he died in 1676, the state came under British control with other territories in Bundelkhand under the Treaty of Bassein in 1802. The ancient title of the ruling family was Maharaja Rao Raja, but in 1865 the British Government recognized only the title of Maharaja as hereditary. For the British, the Peshwa maintained a military force consisting of 945 cavalry, 5203 infantry, and 3 guns.

The motto of the royal family was Wir dalap Sharandah (&quot;Lord of the Brave Army, Giver of Refuge&quot;). In 1896–97, the state suffered from famine, and again to a lesser extent in 1899–1900. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Datia acceded the dominion of India, which later merged with the Union of India. Datia, together with the rest of the Bundelkhand agency, became part of the new state of Vindhya Pradesh in 1950. In 1956, the Vindhya Pradesh state was merged with certain other areas to form the state of Madhya Pradesh within the Union of India.

==Geography==
Datia is located at . It has an average elevation of 302 metres (990 feet).

==Climate==
==Demographics==

As of the 2011 India census, Datia had a population of 100,466. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Datia has an average literacy rate of 68%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 75% and female literacy is 60%. In Datia, 15% of the population is under six years of age.

==Sites of interest==
Datia is best known for the Pitambara Peeth, a famous Shakta pitha located at the entrance of Datia. This pilgrimage spot features Bagalamukhi Devi Temple and Dhumavati Mai Temple, established by Shri Golokwasi Swamiji Maharaj. Vankhandeshwar, a Mahabharat period temple of God Shiva, is also situated here. A temple of the goddess Peetaambara Bagalamukhi, located 12 km from datia and Shri Siddheshwar mahadev temple in village Kurthara located 20 km from Datia and white marble Jain temples are located at Sonagiri. Sonagiri is located 9 miles from Datia and is well connected by road and train.

<doc id="923028" wikidata="Q1047454" url="?curid=923028" title="Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia">
<text>The Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia () was a document promulgated by the Bolshevik government of Russia on 15 November 1917 (2 November in Julian calendar) and signed by Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.

== Content ==
The document proclaimed:

# Equality and sovereignty of peoples of Russia
# Right of peoples of Russia of a free self-determination, including secession and formation of a separate state
# Abolition of all national and religious privileges and restrictions
# Free development of national minorities and ethnographical groups populating the territory of Russia.

The meaning of the Declaration is still disputed in Russian historiography. In 1917 the Bolshevist thinking was still largely idealistic, dominated by vague ideas of &quot;universal happiness&quot;. Also, at that moment Bolsheviks believed that the World revolution was imminent, so they did not care much about loss of territories. However, in the Western literature, it is often argued that in fact Lenin and Stalin agreed to capture mostly the territories they had no sovereignty over since Russia had lost them to Central Powers in 1915 and 1916. Many historians suggest that the purpose of the document was to limit the public dissent after Russia lost most of its western areas to the advancing German Empire and try to complicate the matters behind the front lines.

The declaration was an attempt to rally some ethnic non-Russians behind the Bolsheviks. Latvian riflemen were important supporters of Bolsheviks in the early days of Russian Civil War and Latvian historians recognize the promise of sovereignty as an important reason for that. The anti-revolutionary White Russians did not support self-determination and, as a result, few Latvians fought on the side of the White movement. Intended or not, the declaration&#x27;s provided right to secede was soon exercised by the nations in the western parts of the former Russian Empire, part of which had already been under German army&#x27;s rather than Moscow&#x27;s control. After the collapse of the Central Powers in late 1918, however, Soviet Russia began attempting to establish Soviet power in as many states as possible. In 1918, the Red Army launched a military campaign in the west, invading and occupying Belarus and then advancing against the three Baltic states. In January 1919 the Red Army invaded Ukraine and in July 1920 invaded Poland. In the south, the Red Army invaded the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in April 1920, then invaded the Republic of Armenia in September, and finally invaded the Democratic Republic of Georgia in early 1921, even though Soviet Russia had nominally agreed to Georgia&#x27;s independence in the Treaty of Moscow. 

The initially successful offensive against the Republic of Estonia ignited the Estonian War of Independence which ended with the Soviet recognition of Estonia. Similarly, the campaigns against the Republic of Latvia and Republic of Lithuania ultimately failed, resulting in the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty and Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty respectively. While Ukraine and Belarus were largely conquered, the Soviets ultimately also failed in their invasion of Poland after they were stopped at Warsaw, and hostilities ended with the signing of the Treaty of Riga of 1921. Therefore, in 1920 and 1921, the Soviet Russia recognized all three Baltic States as well as Poland as independent states. Attempts to conquer the Moldavian Democratic Republic holding Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina also failed, and in 1918 Moldavia unified with Romania instead. Years later, following the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and subsequent outbreak of World War II, the Soviet Union would attack many of these territories again, as the Red Army invaded Poland in 1939 and later occupied the Baltic States and Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940. After the conclusion of World War II, the Soviet Union would keep these territories, with the Baltics and Bessarabia annexed to the USSR and Poland forcibly made into a Soviet satellite state. These conquests made by the Red Army between 1918 and 1945 would last until the dissolution of the USSR beginning in 1989, after which all these nations would come to be independent again.

== List of seceded lands ==
The following countries declared their independence soon after the Bolsheviks&#x27; declaration, establishing themselves as non-Communist states. Although the role the declaration played in their independence movements is doubtful, it eased Soviet Russia&#x27;s recognition of their independence. Except for Finland, all of these areas were outside of Russian sovereignty following the Austro-German successes in the World War I and were officially ceded in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

* Finland (6 December 1917)
* (11 December 1917)
* Ukraine (autonomy 22 November 1917, independence 22 January 1918)
* Moldavia (autonomy 15 December 1917, independence 6 February 1918, joined Romania on 9 April 1918)
* (April 22, 1918)
* Belarus (25 March 1918)
* Poland (11 November 1918)
* (18 November 1918)

These countries declared their independence, as Communist states, soon after the declaration:

* (June 1918)

Several other independent republics were proclaimed but were short-lived:

* Transcaucasia (24 February 1918)
* Kuban
* Kazan
* 
* Bashkurdistan
* North Ingria

==Later developments==
Bolsheviks never formally rejected the idea of self-determination, but the Soviet Constitutions (of 1924, 1936 and 1977) limited the right of secession to the constituent republics only.

<doc id="923035" wikidata="Q1388348" url="?curid=923035" title="John Ramsay McCulloch">
<text>John Ramsay McCulloch (1 March 1789 – 11 November 1864) was a Scottish economist, author and editor, widely regarded as the leader of the Ricardian school of economists after the death of David Ricardo in 1823. He was appointed the first professor of political economy at University College London in 1828. He wrote extensively on economic policy, and was a pioneer in the collection, statistical analysis and publication of economic data.

McCulloch was a co-founder, and one of the first editors, of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper, and worked on the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. He edited the 1828 edition of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.

==Career==
McCulloch attended the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate.

McCulloch collected the early literature of political economy, and wrote on the scope and method of economics and the history of economic thought. After his death his library was purchased by Lord Overstone and eventually presented to the University of Reading. He was a participant in the Political Economy Club, London, founded by James Mill and a circle of friends in 1821 for an ongoing discussion of the fundamental principles of political economy.

McCulloch&#x27;s works include a textbook, &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; (Edinburgh 1825). He worked on subsequent editions until his death. This book contains a memorable discussion of the origins of profit or interest in the case of a cask of new wine.

:&quot;Suppose that a cask of new wine, which cost £50, is put into a cellar, and that, at the end of twelve months, it is worth £55, the question is: Should the £5 of additional value, given to the wine, be considered as a compensation for the time the £50 worth of capital has been locked up, or should it be considered as the value of additional labour actually laid out in the wine?&quot;

This question is still used in discussions of the labour theory of value and related issues. McCulloch used it to illustrate that &quot;time cannot of itself produce effect; it merely affords space for really efficient causes to operate, and it is therefore clear it can have nothing to do with value.&quot; Reflecting on discussions in the Political Economy Club, Ricardo had privately expressed his famous opinion about the &quot;non-existence of any measure of absolute value.&quot;

McCulloch was an opponent of Robert Malthus, in response to Malthus&#x27;s &quot;Definitions in Political Economy&quot; (1827) wherein Malthus criticized several contemporary economists, including Jean-Baptiste Say, James Mill, and McCulloch, for what he considered sloppiness in selection of, attachment of meaning to, and usage of their technical terms. In March 1827 McCulloch made a cutting reply on the front page of his Edinburgh newspaper, &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, implying that Malthus wanted to dictate terms and theories to other economists. McCulloch clearly , and his review of &quot;Definitions&quot; is largely a bitter defence of his own &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;, and his counter-attack &quot;does little credit to his reputation&quot;, being largely &quot;personal derogation&quot; of Malthus. The purpose of Malthus&#x27;s &quot;Definitions&quot; was terminological clarity, and Malthus discussed appropriate terms, their definitions, and their use by himself and his contemporaries. This motivation of Malthus&#x27;s work was disregarded by McCulloch, who responded that there was nothing to be gained &quot;by carping at definitions, and quibbling about the meaning to be attached to&quot; words. Given that statement, it is not surprising that McCulloch&#x27;s review failed to address the rules of chapter 1 and did not discuss the definitions of chapter 10; he also barely mentioned Malthus&#x27;s critiques of other writers.

McCulloch died in 1864, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

== Criticism ==
McCulloch&#x27;s theoretical work received harsh criticism from Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk in the latter&#x27;s &quot;History and Critique of Interest Theories&quot; (1884).

:&quot;But probably no member of the English school has been so unhappy in his treatment of the subject or done the theory of interest such a disservice as McCulloch,&quot;

wrote Böhm-Bawerk.

:&quot;He hovers about the fringes of a number of divergent opinions. He penetrates just far enough into each to become involved in glaring self-contradictions, but he does not expand any one of them sufficiently to form a theory that even approaches consistency.&quot;

The labour theory of value is an exception, in that McCulloch seems more insistent about it than about any of the contradictory hypotheses he entertained, Böhm-Bawerk conceded, but the form of that theory McCulloch endorsed was &quot;the most absurd that could possibly occur to a serious thinker.&quot;

On the subject of the wine cask, Böhm-Bawerk wrote that there was an &quot;enormous difference between what he was supposed to prove and what he did prove.&quot; Although such examples may prove that the mere passage of time is not enough of a change to produce an increase of value, that hardly helps the labour theory of value. The physical changes in the wine are produced by the microbes involved in the fermentation process, and the change in exchange value involves the public&#x27;s subjective preference for wine over grape juice, and old wine over new.

<doc id="923044" wikidata="Q236807" url="?curid=923044" title="Yugoslavs">
<text>Yugoslavs or Yugoslavians (; ; ) is an identity that was originally conceived to refer to a united South Slavic people. It has been used in two connotations: the first in a sense of common shared ethnic descent, i.e. panethnic or supraethnic connotation for ethnic South Slavs, and the second as a term for all citizens of former Yugoslavia regardless of ethnicity. Cultural and political advocates of Yugoslav identity have historically purported the identity to be applicable to all people of South Slav heritage, including those of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia. Although Bulgarians are a South Slavic group as well, attempts at uniting Bulgaria with Yugoslavia were unsuccessful, and therefore Bulgarians were not included in the panethnic identification. Since the dissolution of Yugoslavia and establishment of South Slavic nation states, the term &quot;ethnic Yugoslavs&quot; has been used to refer to those who exclusively view themselves as Yugoslavs with no other ethnic self-identification, many of these being of mixed ancestry.

In the former Yugoslavia, the official designation for those who declared themselves simply as &quot;Yugoslav&quot; was with quotation marks, &quot;Yugoslavs&quot; (introduced in census 1971). The quotation marks were originally meant to distinguish Yugoslav ethnicity from Yugoslav citizenship, which was written without quotation marks. The majority of those who had once identified as ethnic &quot;Yugoslavs&quot; reverted to or adopted traditional ethnic and national identities, sometimes due to social pressure, intimidation, detrimental consequences, or prevention to continue identifying as Yugoslav by new political authorities. Some also decided to turn to sub-national regional identifications, especially in multi-ethnic historical regions like Istria, Vojvodina, or Bosnia (hence Bosnians). The Yugoslav designation, however, continues to be used by many, especially in the United States, Canada, and Australia by the descendants of Yugoslav migrants who emigrated while the country still existed.

==History==
===Yugoslavism and Yugoslavia===

Since the late 18th century, when traditional European ethnic affiliations started to mature into modern ethnic identities, there have been numerous attempts to define a common South Slavic ethnic identity. The word &quot;Yugoslav&quot;, meaning &quot;South Slavic&quot;, was first used by Josip Juraj Strossmayer in 1849. The first modern iteration of Yugoslavism was the Illyrian movement in Habsburg Croatia. It identified South Slavs with ancient Illyrians and sought to construct a common language based on the Shtokavian dialect. The movement was led by Ljudevit Gaj, whose Latin alphabet became one of two official scripts used for the Serbo-Croatian language.

Among notable supporters of Yugoslavism and a Yugoslav identity active at the beginning of the 20th century were famous sculptor Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), who called Serbian folk hero Prince Marko &quot;our Yugoslav people with its gigantic and noble heart&quot; and wrote poetry speaking of a &quot;Yugoslav race&quot;; Jovan Cvijić, in his article &quot;The Bases of Yugoslav Civilization&quot;, developed the idea of a unified Yugoslav culture and stated that &quot;New qualities that until now have been expressed but weakly will appear. An amalgamation of the most fertile qualities of our three tribes [Serbs, Croats, Slovenes] will come forth every more strongly, and thus will be constructed the type of single Yugoslav civilization-the final and most important goal of our country.&quot; In late 19th and early 20th century, influential public intellectuals Jovan Cvijić and Vladimir Dvorniković advocated that &quot;Yugoslavs&quot;, as a supra-ethnic nation, had &quot;many tribal ethnicities, such as Croats, Serbs, and others within it.&quot;

On 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austrian throne, and his wife, in Sarajevo. Princip was a member of Young Bosnia, a group whose aims included the unification of the Yugoslavs and independence from Austria-Hungary. The assassination in Sarajevo set into motion a series of fast-moving events that eventually escalated into full-scale war. After his capture, during his trial, he stated &quot;I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria.&quot;

In June–July 1917, the Yugoslav Committee met with the Serbian Government in Corfu and on 20 July the Corfu Declaration that laid the foundation for the post-war state was issued. The preamble stated that the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were &quot;the same by blood, by language, by the feelings of their unity, by the continuity and integrity of the territory which they inhabit undivided, and by the common vital interests of their national survival and manifold development of their moral and material life.&quot; The state was created as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, a constitutional monarchy under the Karađorđević dynasty. The term &quot;Yugoslavs&quot; was used to refer to all of its inhabitants, but particularly to those of South Slavic ethnicity. Some Croatian nationalists viewed the Serb plurality and Serbian royal family as hegemonic. Eventually, a conflict of interest sparked among the Yugoslav peoples. In 1929, King Alexander sought to resolve a deep political crisis brought on by ethnic tensions by assuming dictatorial powers in the 6 January Dictatorship, renaming the country &quot;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&quot;, and officially pronouncing that there is one single Yugoslav nation with three tribes. The Yugoslav ethnic designation was thus imposed for a period of time on all South Slavs in Yugoslavia. Changes in Yugoslav politics after King Alexander&#x27;s death in 1934 brought an end to this policy, but the designation continued to be used by some people.

Philosopher Vladimir Dvorniković advocated the establishment of a Yugoslav ethnicity in his 1939 book entitled &quot;The Characterology of the Yugoslavs&quot;. His views included eugenics and cultural blending to create one, strong Yugoslav nation.

There had on three occasions been efforts to make Bulgaria a part of Yugoslavia or part of an even larger federation: through Aleksandar Stamboliyski during and after World War I; through Zveno during the Bulgarian coup d&#x27;état of 1934, and through Georgi Dimitrov during and after World War II, but for various reasons, each attempt turned out to be unsuccessful.

===Self-identification in Yugoslavia===
Unitary policies implemented by the authorities of the early 20th century Kingdom of Yugoslavia aimed at creating a single Yugoslav ethnic identity that speaks one South Slavic language were met with heavy resistance by majorities of the country&#x27;s citizens. Those policies and attempts at concentration of power within the ruling Serbian royal dynasty, the Karađorđevićs, were interpreted by opponents of Yugoslav unitarism and Serbian nationalism as gradual Serbianization of Yugoslavia&#x27;s non-Serb population.

After the country was liberated from Axis occupiers in the World War II in Yugoslavia by the Yugoslav Partisans, the newly established socialist Yugoslavia was instead organized as a federation. The ruling League of Communists of Yugoslavia was ideologically opposed to ethnic unitarism that was promoted under former royal hegemony, instead recognizing and promoting ethnic diversity and social Yugoslavism within the notion of &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot; between nations and national minorities of Yugoslavia. Traditional ethnic identities again became the primary ethnic designations used by most inhabitants of Yugoslavia which remained the case until the country&#x27;s dissolution in the early 1990s.

Josip Broz Tito expressed his desire for an undivided Yugoslav ethnicity to develop naturally when he stated, &quot;I would like to live to see the day when Yugoslavia would become amalgamated into a firm community, when she would no longer be a formal community but a community of a single Yugoslav nation.&quot;

Yugoslav censuses reflected Tito&#x27;s ideal, with &quot;Yugoslav&quot; being an available identification for both ethnicity and nationality. In general, the Yugoslav identity was more common in the multiethnic regions of the country, i.e. the more multiethnic the constituent republic, the higher the percentage; therefore the highest were in Croatia, Montenegro, Central Serbia, Vojvodina, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the lowest were in Slovenia, Macedonia, and Kosovo. The 1971 census recorded 273,077 Yugoslavs, or 1.33% of the total population. The 1981 census, a year after the death of Tito, recorded a record number of 1,216,463 or 5.4% Yugoslavs.

*In the 1991 census, 5.54% (242,682) of the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared themselves to be Yugoslav. The Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1990 ratified a Presidency of seven members. One of the seven was to be elected among/by the republic&#x27;s Yugoslavs, thereby introducing the Yugoslavs next to ethnic Muslims, Serbs and Croats into the Constitutional framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina although on an inferior level. However, because of the Bosnian War that erupted in 1992, this Constitution was short-lived and unrealized.
*Approximately 5% of the population of Montenegro also declared themselves Yugoslav in the same census.
*The 1981 census showed that Yugoslavs made up around 8.2% of the population in Croatia, this being the highest ever percentage of &quot;Yugoslavs&quot; within a constituent republic&#x27;s borders. The percentage was the highest in multiethnic regions and cities with large non-Croatian population and among those of mixed ancestry. The 1991 census data indicated that the number of Yugoslavs had dropped to 2% of the population in Croatia.
*The autonomous region of Vojvodina, marked by its traditionally multiethnic make-up, recorded a similar percentage as Croatia at the 1981 census, with ~8% of its 2 million inhabitants declaring themselves Yugoslav.

Just before and after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, most Yugoslavs reverted to their ethnic and regional identities.

==Successor states==
===Self-identification following dissolution===
The number of people identifying as Yugoslav fell drastically in all successor states since the beginning of the 21st century and the conclusion of all Yugoslav Wars and separation of Serbia and Montenegro (until 2003 called FR Yugoslavia). The country with the highest number of people and percentage of population identifying as Yugoslav is Serbia, while North Macedonia is the lowest on both. No official figures or reliable estimates are available for Kosovo.

As part of the research project &quot;Strategies of Symbolic Nation-building in South Eastern Europe&quot;, a study was conducted from 2010 to 2014 on the entire former Yugoslav territory with the exception of Slovenia. Within the study, a poll was conducted on the topic of shared identity. Interviewees were asked whether they ever &quot;felt Yugoslav&quot;, with three given options being tantamount to &quot;yes, still do&quot;, &quot;no, never did&quot; and &quot;not anymore&quot;. In all six examined states, majority of the interviewees expressed that they either never or no longer felt so, ranging from ~70–98%, with Serbia being on the lowest end and Kosovo on the highest. Croatia and Kosovo yielded the most clear-cut results with 95% stating either of aforementioned options and less than 3% stating that they still felt Yugoslav. In Kosovo in particular, over 92% stated that they never felt Yugoslav. In contrast, Montenegro and Serbia were the most split states, with ~28% and ~32% respectively stating that they still felt Yugoslav; the two were the only states where more interviewees stated feeling Yugoslav as opposed to never feeling so. Bosnia and Herzegovina had the highest percentage of interviewees stating that they no longer feel Yugoslav at ~48%, followed closely by Montenegro and Serbia. The following table provides more details:

===Organizations===

The Yugoslavs of Croatia have several organizations. The &quot;Alliance of Yugoslavs&quot; (&quot;Savez Jugoslavena&quot;), established in 2010 in Zagreb, is an association aiming to unite the Yugoslavs of Croatia, regardless of religion, sex, political or other views. Its main goal is the official recognition of the Yugoslav nation in every Yugoslav successor state: Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.

Another pro-Yugoslav organization advocating the recognition of the Yugoslav nation is the &quot;Our Yugoslavia&quot; association (&quot;Udruženje &quot;Naša Jugoslavija&quot;&quot;), which is an officially registered organization in Croatia. The seat of Our Yugoslavia is in the Istrian town of Pula, where it was founded on 30 July 2009. The association has most members in the towns of Rijeka, Zagreb and Pula. Its main aim is the stabilisation of relations among the Yugoslav successor states. It is also active in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, its official registration as an association was denied by the Bosnian state authorities.

The probably best-known pro-Yugoslav organization in Montenegro is the &quot;Consulate-general of the SFRY&quot; with its headquarters in the coastal town of Tivat. Prior to the population census of 2011, Marko Perković, the president of this organization called on the Yugoslavs of Montenegro to freely declare their Yugoslav identity on the upcoming census.

==Notable people==
The best known example of self-declared Yugoslavs is Marshal Josip Broz Tito who organized resistance against Nazi Germany in Yugoslavia, ended the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia with the help of the Red Army, co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement, and defied Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet pressure on Yugoslavia. Other people that declared as &quot;Yugoslavs&quot; include intellectuals, entertainers, singers, and athletes, such as:

* Ivo Andrić
* Goran Bregović
* Lepa Brena
* Joška Broz, the grandson of Josip Broz Tito
* Oliver Dulić
* Srđan Dragojević
* Đorđe Đogani
* Branko Đurić 
* Ivan Ergić
* Andrej Grubačić
* Ekrem Jevrić
* Božo Koprivica
* Magnifico
* Igor Mandić
* Branko Milićević &quot;Kockica&quot;
* Milan Milišić
* Ašok Murti
* Ivica Osim
* Srđa Popović
* Dževad Prekazi
* Miljenko Smoje
* Branimir Štulić
* Bogdan Tanjević
* Dubravka Ugrešić
* Jovan Vavic
* Duško Vujošević
* Milić Vukašinović
* Đorđe Balašević

==Symbols==

The probably most frequently used symbol of the Yugoslavs to express their identity and to which they are most often associated with is the blue-white-red tricolor flag with a yellow-bordered red star in the flag&#x27;s center, which also served as the national flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1945 and 1991.

Prior to World War II, the symbol of Yugoslavism was a plain tricolor flag of blue, white, and red, which was also the national flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav state in the interwar period.
