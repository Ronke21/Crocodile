<text>George Engelmann, also known as Georg Engelmann, (2 February 1809 – 4 February 1884) was a German-American botanist. He was instrumental in describing the flora of the west of North America, then very poorly known to Europeans; he was particularly active in the Rocky Mountains and northern Mexico, one of his constant companions being another German-American, the botanical illustrator Paulus Roetter.

==Biography==
===Origins===
George Engelmann was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the oldest of thirteen children, nine of whom reached maturity. His father, Julius Bernhardt Engelmann, was a member of a family from which for several successive generations were chosen ministers for the Reformed Church at Bacharach-on-the-Rhine. Julius was a graduate of the University of Halle, and was also educated for the ministry, but he devoted his life to education. He established a school for young women in Frankfurt, which was rare at the time. George Engelmann&#x27;s mother, Julie Antoinette, was the only daughter of Antoinette André and George Oswald May. The latter, in his earlier years, was an artist of note at the Court of Weimar. Julie Antoinette was Julius Engelmann&#x27;s coadjutor in the school for young women, and its success was largely due to her management and tact.

His cousin, Adolph Engelmann, was a colonel during the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War.

===Education===
George Engelmann received his early education at the gymnasium in Frankfurt. According to himself, he first became interested in plants around age 15. He voluntarily devoted much of his time after school duties to studying history, modern languages, and drawing.

Assisted by a scholarship (founded by the “Reformed Congregation of Frankfurt”), in 1827 he began to study sciences at the University of Heidelberg, where he met Karl Schimper and Alexander Braun. With the latter especially an intimate friendship and correspondence were preserved unbroken until Braun&#x27;s death in 1877. He also retained friendship with Schimper. However, that erratic genius abandoned botany despite obtaining a remarkable grasp of philosophical botany and laying the foundations of phyllotaxy.

In 1828 young Engelmann&#x27;s studies at Heidelberg were interrupted by his having joined the students in a political demonstration. He thereupon left Heidelberg and entered the University of Berlin, where he stayed for two years. In 1831, he received the degree of MD from the University of Würzburg.

His dissertation for the medical degree, more related to botany than to medicine, was published at Frankfurt in 1832 under the title of &quot;De Antholysi Prodromus&quot;. It was devoted to morphology — mainly to the structure of monstrosities and aberrant forms of plants — and was illustrated by five plates of figures drawn and transferred to the lithographic stone by the author&#x27;s own hand. Its subject was so directly in line with that of a treatise on the metamorphosis of plants by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that it was heartily welcomed by the poet-philosopher, whose own life was then approaching its close. Having received Engelmann&#x27;s treatise through his correspondent Marianne von Willemer, Goethe inquired after the young author, saying that Engelmann had completely apprehended Goethe&#x27;s ideas concerning vegetable morphology, and had shown a peculiar genius for their development. So strong was his confidence in Engelmann&#x27;s ability that he offered to give him his whole store of unpublished notes and sketches.

In 1832 Engelmann went to Paris, where he again became associated with Braun, and also with Louis Agassiz.

===Emigration to United States===
Wishing to visit America, he accepted a proposition from his uncles to become their agent for the purchase of lands in the United States. In September 1832, he sailed from Bremen for Baltimore, Maryland. In addition to his duties assessing land investment opportunities, he also spent time on botanical travels, first visiting Thomas Nuttall in Philadelphia. He then went to St. Louis, Missouri, and from there around to the adjacent states. He settled with his relatives and the lawyer Gustav Koerner on a farm in St. Clair County, Illinois near Belleville for three years.

For the purpose of forming a correct judgment of the lands of the new country to which he had come, he made many long, lonesome, and often adventurous horse-back journeys in Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas. He often suffered sickness and hardship upon those journeys, but he persevered until he finished all the business he had planned to do. He made much use of his scientific, as well as practical, knowledge in the prosecution of that business, doing mineralogical and geological work, but only the botanical notes which he then made were used in his subsequent scientific career.

===Medical practice===
Having completed his business engagement, in the autumn of 1835 Engelmann moved to St. Louis and established a medical practice. During the three years that had passed since he left his native land the slender means he brought with him became exhausted, and he began the practice of his profession in absolute poverty. To furnish an office he was even obliged to part with his gun and with the faithful horse which had carried him on so many long and lonesome journeys. At that time St. Louis was little more than a frontier trading post, but Engelmann had strong faith in its future greatness, and he lived to see it become one of the chief cities of the United States. In 1836 he founded a German newspaper called &quot;Das Westland&quot;, which contained valuable articles on life and manners in the United States, and gained a high reputation both in the United States and in Europe.

Four years were passed before he had laid the foundation of his medical practice and had earned the means of making a visit to his old German home. In 1840 he returned to Germany, where in Kreuznach he married his cousin Dorothea Horstmann on June 11. (Their son George Julius Engelmann became a noted gynecologist.) They soon returned to America. Upon reaching New York City, Engelmann for the first time met Asa Gray, already the most noted of American botanists, and the friendship between those two eminent men thus begun was broken only by death. This friendship is noteworthy because of the evidently beneficial effect which it had upon botanical science in America.

Upon his return to St. Louis with his young wife, Engelmann immediately resumed his medical practice. Then, and long afterward, a large proportion of the inhabitants of St. Louis were of French and German-speaking families, and his familiarity with those languages, as well as with the English, gave him great advantage in extending his practice. Because of this and of his great professional ability, as the years went on he acquired a financial competence that gave him an independence. Never, however, did he take advantage of his success in this respect to lessen his labors, for whenever his medical labors were relaxed his scientific work fully engrossed his attention.

The confidence he inspired in his medical clientele was such that as he grew older he could take long vacations and resume his practice almost at will. After 1869, he no longer kept a medical office and attended the few patients he saw in his study. Still, it was always difficult for him to refuse medical aid to those who sought it, and even up to the last year of his life there were old friends to whose families he was the only acceptable medical adviser and whose appeal for aid he could not refuse. Illustrating this fact, as well as Engelmann&#x27;s energetic manner, his son relates the following incident: “It was a bitter, sleety winter night, when the ringing of the doorbell awoke me, and I heard an urgent call for father from the messenger of a patient. I would not arouse him, and proposed to go myself; but he had heard all, and, hurrying into his clothes, was ready to go in spite of my remonstrance &#x27;What of the night?&#x27; he said, vexed at my interference, &#x27;Am I already useless, to be cast aside? I would rather die in harness than rust out.&#x27; So I helped him down the icy steps, through the blinding sleet, into his carriage, and off on his mission of mercy.”

===Botanical studies===
Engelmann devoted himself to his medical practice, but in his later years made a specialty of botany. An 1842 monograph on dodders, a very difficult genus to examine, had established his reputation as a botanist. Other taxonomically difficult plants groups that he studied include conifers, cacti, grapes, rushes, yuccas and mistletoes.

He took several vacations from his medical practice and devoted them all to the gathering of data for his scientific work, the details of which were elaborated at his home. One of these vacations extended from 1856 to 1858, the greater part of the first summer having been spent in botanical work at the Harvard gardens and herbarium in companionship with Asa Gray. Then, with his wife and young son, he visited his native land and other parts of Europe, occupying his time with scientific observation and study. In 1868 Dr. Engelmann and his wife again visited Europe for a year, the son being then in Berlin pursuing his medical studies. These visits to Europe were also the occasions of frequent and familiar personal interviews with men whose names were well known to the scientific world, such as Joseph Dalton Hooker, Alexander Braun, De Bary, Virchow, and others.

In 1859, he published &quot;Cactaceae of the Boundary&quot; which studied cacti on the border of the United States and Mexico.
He also made special studies of the pines, rushes, spurges, and other little-known and difficult groups, contributing numerous articles on them to the St. Louis Academy of Sciences, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and to government reports. Material in his specialties collected by the federal government was sent to him for examination. He was one of the earliest to study the North American vines, and nearly all that is known scientifically of the American species and forms is due to his investigations. His first monograph on &quot;The Grape-Vines of Missouri&quot; was published in 1860, and his latest on this subject shortly before his death. His two major works on cacti remain important today.

He was a founder and longtime president of the St. Louis Academy of Sciences, and encouraged the wealthy St. Louis businessman Henry Shaw to develop his gardens to be of scientific as well as public use; &quot;Shaw&#x27;s Gardens&quot; became the Missouri Botanical Garden. On a visit to England in 1857, he had consulted with William Jackson Hooker on the establishment of Shaw&#x27;s gardens, eventually becoming Missouri Botanical Garden&#x27;s scientific advisor, in addition to his roles as physician and botanist. He was also one of the original founders of the National Academy of Sciences. With Asa Gray and Ferdinand Lindheimer he edited the exsiccata-like series &quot;Lindheimer Flora Texana exsiccata&quot;.

===Phylloxera===
In 1861, Engelmann had published a pioneering paper in the United States examining plant diseases. It focussed on the grape. He also established an herbarium for 10 species of grape (&quot;Vitis&quot;) he had discovered. Engelmann&#x27;s comprehensive research on North American &quot;Vitis&quot; and his lengthy work with the wine industry were parts of his botanical career that dovetailed with his medical career (he prescribed wine as medicine) and had culturally significant implications.

For example, Engelmann played an important, but little known role in rescuing the French wine industry. In the 1870s French vineyards came under attack by a small insect, &quot;Phylloxera vastatrix&quot;, an aphid-like pest which sucks sap from the roots of grape vines. Growers observed that certain imported American vines resisted this pest, and the French government dispatched a scientist to St. Louis to consult with the Missouri state entomologist and with Engelmann, who had studied American grapes since the 1850s. Engelmann verified that certain living American species had resisted Phylloxera for nearly 40 years. In addition, &quot;Vitis riparia&quot;, a wild vine of the Mississippi Valley, did not cross pollinate with less resistant species, the cause of previous grafting failures. Engelmann arranged to have millions of shoots and seeds collected and sent to France, where the species proved to be very successful in providing rootstock.

===Other fields===
While botanical investigations constituted much the greater part of Dr. Engelmann&#x27;s scientific work, he always had in hand data for other investigations. For example, he began meteorological observations when he first settled at St. Louis, and personally, or by proxy during his absence, he continued them without intermission until his death — a longer period, it is believed, than that of similar observations by any one man in America.

Engelmann often compared meteorological data with his friend and contemporary Augustus Fendler. The two also collaborated on horticultural experiments on cacti, and frequently corresponded on the matter of specimen collection.

Among the animals he studied were tapeworms (&quot;Taenia&quot;), the opossum, squirrels and mudpuppies (&quot;Menobranchus&quot;).

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1862.

===Later explorations===
The death of his wife on January 29, 1879, greatly affected him. He turned to plants, seeking relief in study, but life and a continuance of its labors seemed to be almost hopeless. His condition changed but little during the remainder of the winter, but when in the spring C. S. Sargent came with the proposition that he should join him in a journey through the forests of the Pacific Coast region he accepted it. That journey, although a difficult one for a man of his age, was of great benefit to him physically. His shattered spirit also was much revived and, among his friends, he resumed and sustained his lifelong habit of cheerfulness of manner.

==Legacy==
He is commemorated in the names of several plants, including Engelmann Oak (&quot;Quercus engelmannii&quot;), Engelmann Spruce (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot;), Apache Pine (&quot;Pinus engelmannii&quot;), Engelmann&#x27;s quillwort or Appalachian quillwort (&quot;Isoetes engelmannii&quot;), and Engelmann&#x27;s Prickly-pear (&quot;Opuntia engelmannii&quot;).

Engelmann&#x27;s botanical collection, valuable as containing the original specimens from which many western plants have been named and described, was given to the Missouri Botanical Garden. This gift led to the founding of the Henry Shaw School of Botany as a department of Washington University in St. Louis, where an Engelmann professorship of botany has been established by Shaw in his honor.

Engelmann was interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

<text>Komarno (, ; ; ) is a city located in Lviv Raion (district) of Lviv Oblast (region) in western Ukraine. Local government is administered by Komarno City Council. It hosts the administration of Komarno urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. The population is approximately 

==History==
The village of Komarno was first mentioned in 1427. In 1471, Komarno got the Magdeburg rights. In the center of town is an old Polish Kostel (Catholic Church), as well as an old wooden Ukrainian Orthodox church complete with ancient icons. The river Vereshytsia flows through the town.

The Jewish Hasidic dynasty of Komarno originates from this town, and there was a sizable Jewish community in the town from the 16th century until World War II when they were murdered.

Komarno, which until the Partitions of Poland belonged to Ruthenian Voivodeship, received its town charter (Magdeburg rights) in 1471 from King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk. The town was under protection of Voivode Stanislaw de Chodecz, who in 1473 founded here a Roman Catholic church. Komarno was a local center of textile industry. The town was divided into several districts, and remained in private hands of several voivodes. In 1590, it belonged to Jan Ostrorog, the voivode of Poznań, and in the 17th century, it was property of the House of Wiśniowiecki. Later on, Komarno belonged to the Ogiński family, and Lanckoroński family. In the 19th century, when it already was part of Austrian Galicia, the Lanckoroński family built here a palace. The last owner of Komarno was Countess Karolina Lanckorońska.

In 1648, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, Komarno was besieged by the Cossack-Tatar forces. On 8 October 1672 the Battle of Komarno took place here, in which King Jan III Sobieski destroyed a 10,000 strong Tatar unit.

In 1918, Komarno returned to Poland, and by 1939, its population was approximately 5,000. Until the Invasion of Poland, the town belonged to Lwów Voivodeship.

Prior to World War II, the town had a Jewish population of about 2,400. During World War II, the Jewish population was murdered in the town by Germans and their Ukrainian auxiliaries or sent to Belzec to be murdered there. Only a handful of Komarno&#x27;s Jews survived the Holocaust.

Komarno has a former Roman Catholic church (1658), which in 1946 was turned by Soviet authorities into a warehouse. In 1992, Ukrainian government returned the complex to the faithful, but soon afterwards, it was handed over to the local Greek-Catholic community. Among people associated with Komarno are Jan Kilarski (mathematician), Countess Karolina Lanckoronska, linguist Roman Laskowski, historian Jozef Leszczynski, and writer Karol Szajnocha.

Until 18 July 2020, Komarno belonged to Horodok Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven. The area of Horodok Raion was merged into Lviv Raion.

<text>Erik Poppe (born 24 June 1960) is a Norwegian film director, producer and screenwriter.

Poppe is regarded as one of Scandinavia&#x27;s most experienced and compelling film directors recognized for his work with actors and multi-pronged narratives. His movies are often built around ensemble casts, sharp writing, impressive camera work and an uncanny knack for rhythm and music in the editing.

He is best known for directing critically acclaimed films including &quot;Hawaii, Oslo&quot; (2004), &quot;A Thousand Times Good Night&quot; (2013), &quot;The King&#x27;s Choice&quot; (2016) and Utøya: July 22.

== Early life and education ==
Poppe was born on 24 June 1960 in Oslo to Aase and Per Frølich Poppe, who was a fashion designer in winter sport clothing. As a child he grew up in Portugal and Norway.

He started his career as a photographer for the newspaper Verdens Gang and Reuters, covering domestic news as well as international conflicts. Being hospitalized after an assignment in Colombia he decided to prepare leaving journalism and study filmmaking.

He graduated as a cinematographer at Dramatiska Institutet - University College of Film, Radio, Television and Theatre in Stockholm, Sweden in 1991. He have conducted several artistic and directorial research programs between 2001 and 2010.

In 2015 Poppe concluded a PhD as a research fellow at the Norwegian Artistic Research Programme and as an Associated Professor at HIL, Lillehammer University College/ The Norwegian Film School. &quot;The Subjective Objective&quot; is an exploration on how to achieve increased emotionally outcome by the use of a highly personalized and strictly subjectively point of view in conscious narrative film. -Is it possible to achieve a stronger identification, empathy and a greater involvement for the spectator by applying a strict enforcement of the subjective point of view? -A point of view who never allows the filmmaker to show for the spectator more than the film&#x27;s protagonist are seeing or experiencing at any time.

The project developed various measures for an increased empathy with the narrative&#x27;s protagonist and discuss further elements to be considered for a stronger subjectivity.

The key artistic work made as part of the research was the feature movie A Thousand Times Good Night, a dramatization of his experiences as a conflict photographer in Democratic Republic of the Congo and Afghanistan.

== Career ==
Erik Poppe worked as Director of Photography on several features, as well as EGGS (1995) by Bent Hamer. He was awarded with the Kodak Award at the Moscow International Film Festival and won the Cinematographer of the year award in Norway. By receiving the Kodak Award he announced his end of work as Director of Photography.

=== Oslo Trilogy ===
Troubled Water (2008, aka: deUSYNLIGE) is the third part of his multi-awarded Oslo Trilogy, after his directorial debut with SCHPAAA (1998, aka Bunch Of Five) and Hawaii, Oslo (2004).

Working on the research for Schpaaa; a terrifying look at multi-racial youth gangs in Norway and shot in the style of a documentary, he discovered realities he wanted to adapt into two more movies.

Hawaii-Oslo tells a story about a number of people whose fates intertwine, sometimes by accident, during the hottest day of the year in downtown Oslo. Troubled Water is a story about a young man released from prison after serving a sentence for an alleged murder of a child. All of the movies are shoot in the area of Groenland and Grunerloekka in downtown Oslo. &quot;The place where we live so close to each other, and know so little about each other.&quot;

A Thousand Times Good Night (2013, aka: 1000 Times Good Night, Tusen Ganger God Natt) was Poppe&#x27;s first English-language movie. The film is partly an autobiographical story based on Poppe experiences as a conflict photographer. Poppe switched the lead roles around making the French actress Juliette Binoche as his proxy, and Game of Throne&#x27;s -Nicolaj Coster-Waldau playing the character based on Poppe&#x27;s wife. A standing ovation greeted Montreal World Film Festival&#x27;s world premiere of the film, which went on to earn the Jury&#x27;s Special Grand Prix.

The King&#x27;s Choice (2016) is based on the true the story about the three dramatic days in April 1940, when Haakon VII of Norway is presented with the monstrous ultimatum from the Germans: surrender or die. With German Air Force and soldiers hunting them down, the royal family is forced to flee from the capital. After three days of desperately trying to evade the Germans, King Haakon makes his final decision, one that may cost him, his family and many Norwegians their lives.

The film made records when it opened in Norway by late September 2016 and became the #1 box office hit of the year. The film was Norway&#x27;s official entry in the best foreign language film category for the 2017 Oscars and made a shortlist nomination for the Oscars.

Per Fugelli (1943-2017) was a Norwegian doctor, a professor of social medicine and a forceful voice in the public sphere. Fugelli spent his life addressing questions of freedom and respect, campaigning for rights of the less fortunate.

Fugelli was diagnosed with cancer in 2009. In 2015 he said no to further treatment and allowed his close friend, director Erik Poppe to follow him as far as possible on this journey. The result is I DIE (Siste resept) a film about life and how to live it to the very end.

In June 2017 it was announced that Erik Poppe had worked for a year on developing a feature film about the 2011 terrorist attack on Utøya outside Oslo, Norway.
The film, entitled U, begins 12 minutes before the first shot on Utøya as we meet Kaja (18), her little sister, and their friends at summer camp. When the shooting begins panic spreads, and over the next 72 minutes we follow Kaja in her escape – minute by minute. She becomes separated from her little sister, and in the search for her she finds other youngsters with different strategies for survival. Some make it, others do not.
U July 22 (Utøya 22.juli) is a fictional account of events which will tell the story from the young people&#x27;s perspective, based on a series of in-depth interviews conducted with survivors from Utøya. Some of them was on set behind the camera while filming took place in September 2017 to help give the narrative credibility.

Erik Poppe was also the key director for &quot;Brigaden&quot; (The Brigade) in 2002. A 26 episodes TV-drama for NRK (The Norwegian Broadcasting Corp). Brigaden received the Norwegian &quot;Amanda&quot; Price for the Best TV-drama in 2003.

== Awards ==

Erik Poppe is the only director to have received the Norwegian National Film Critics&#x27; Award four times. Hawaii-Oslo in 2005, Troubled Water in 2009, A Thousand Times Good Night in 2014 and The Kings Choice in 2017 - all movies were also voted as last year&#x27;s Best Feature.

When he received the price for best film in 2014 at The Amanda, he became historical by being the only director to have been nominated for all his feature movies (five movies) in the categories best film or/ and best director at the Amanda, Norway&#x27;s national film prizes.

The King&#x27;s Choice (&quot;Kongens nei&quot;) was the Amanda jury&#x27;s clear favorite at 2017&#x27;s awards as well. Nominated for a record 13 Amandas — Norway&#x27;s national film prizes — it snagged eight.

Poppe has participated in key festivals, and received prizes such as the Berlinale -Panorama (Schpaaa), The Vesuvio Prize at Napoli International Film Festival, Norwegian entries for best foreign language movie at Oscars, Festroia in Portugal for Best Directing, Silver Dolphin in Festroia, Nordic Ministerie Councils Award for The Best Nordic Feature, ecumenical awards.

Troubled Water made history at the Hamptons International Film Festival in 2008 by being the first feature to win both the festival&#x27;s Golden Starfish for Best Narrative Feature and the Audience Award.

Poppe received the Special Golden Angel, the lifetime achievement award, for his work as Outstanding European Film Artist at the 2016 International Film Festival TOFIFEST in Poland.

Erik Poppe is co-owner of Paradox Film and the Paradox Group. A series of companies producing features.

On his career as a photojournalist: &quot;All the actions I undertook back then were driven by the urge to draw attention to the horrors of war. I wanted for my pictures to grab you by the throat, when eating breakfast on a Saturday morning.&quot;

On working with feature movies: &quot;You need to be honest, because this way your audience will be able to identify with the topic and the hero. My role, as an artist, is to prepare a text with open questions and hide the fact that I have an answer key. Questions will provoke audience to discuss the film and seek new perspectives. The film is supposed to make a difference, and maybe offer a therapeutic effect.&quot;

It is bordered by the suburbs of Eschol Park, Kearns, Raby, Blairmount, Woodbine, St Andrews and Claymore.

==History==
Following European settlement, many new settlements were established to the south west of Sydney, to cater for the growing agricultural demands of the growing colony. The land surrounding these settlements were subsequently divided up and given away as land grants to settlers in order to establish farms. One such grant, worth, was that given to Thomas Clarkson on the western hills of Campbelltown, at the base of what is now called the &#x27;Scenic Hills&#x27;. Clarkson, an ex-convict turned businessman and baker, established the property of &#x27;Woodland Grove,&#x27; which not only covered modern day Eagle Vale, but most of its surrounding suburbs. After his death in 1826, his property was sold to Jemima Jenkins, a wealthy widow of the founder of the &quot;Bank of New South Wales&quot; (now Westpac). She renamed the property &#x27;Eagle Farm&#x27; and used the address &#x27;Eagle Farm, Eagle Vale.&#x27; The name Eagle Vale originated from two creeks that ran through the property, Eagle Creek and Valebrook, the later now being located in the suburb of Eschol Park. (The two creeks were later converted into flood retention basins&#x27; and stormwater channels) She later sold a large part of the western side of the property to the Kearns family, who used it to expand the adjacent property of &#x27;Epping Forest.&#x27; Once Jenkins died, the land eventually ended up in the ownership of William Fowler, a Campbelltown business man, who again renamed the property, this time to &#x27;Eschol Park,&#x27; and the name Eagle Vale eventually fell into a period of disuse.

It was not until 1976, when the property of Highlands was being subdivided for suburban residential use that the name of Eagle Vale surfaced once again, to be applied to the new subdivision between the newly developed suburb of Eschol Park and the public housing estate of Claymore. In 1978, the first housing lots were released, and several land releases continued into the 1980s, with some smaller releases continuing into the early 1990s. The relatively low price of the land meant that it quickly attracted first home buyers, often young families. Eagle Vale, much like the rest of Campbelltown area, has often attracted an unfortunate reputation for being a somewhat undesirable suburb, an attitude that is compounded by its proximity to the public housing suburb of Claymore which itself is often negatively perceived. This negative image of Claymore even prompted residents of privately owned houses in the suburb to lobby for the suburb borders to be altered in order to place them into Eagle Vale, which was eventually achieved in 1986. This explains why some of the streets on the eastern side of the suburb have names following Claymore&#x27;s street naming theme, Great Australian Artists, such as Albert Namatjira, rather than Eagle Vale&#x27;s theme of minerals and gemstones, such as Emerald, Cameo and Aquamarine.

The suburb features several parks and reserves, including Thomas Clarkson Reserve, located on the former route of Eagle Creek, which features the original ornamental pond from the Jenkins estate. Adjacent suburbs also feature parks named after Jemima Jenkins (in Kearns) and William Fowler (in Eschol Park); and Valebrook Reserve, located on the former location of Valebrook Creek.

Ivan Milat, the famous &quot;Backpacker Murders&quot; serial killer and, rapist, now deceased, resided at 22 Cinnabar Street, Eagle Vale. (http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/milat/13.html)

==Commercial areas==
Eagle Vale Marketplace is a shopping centre that opened in 1995, featuring a Woolworths supermarket and specialty shops. A police station was added in 2000. Eagle Vale Leisure Centre was opened in 1993 as a multipurpose gym and aquatic centre. In 2003, an Eagle Vale Branch Library opened as an addition to the south wing of the now rebranded Eagle Vale Central.

==Schools==
The public high school, Eagle Vale High School, opened in 1984. In 2021 the school voted the class &quot;Loyal&quot; as the one with the &quot;Best and Brightest&quot; students. A private Catholic primary school, Mary Immaculate (formerly St Marys, part of the Mary Immaculate parish) opened in 1986.

==Population==
According to the , Eagle Vale had a population of 5,789 people. The median age in the suburb was 36, compared to a national median of 38. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.0% of the population. The most common ancestries in Eagle Vale were Australian 27.7%, English 23.0%, Irish 5.6%, Scottish 4.9% and Filipino 4.3%. 62.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Philippines 3.2%, New Zealand 2.7%, Fiji 2.3%, England 1.6% and India 1.6%. 62.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Arabic 5.6%, Spanish 2.2%, Hindi 2.0%, Lao 2.0% and Samoan 2.0%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 27.0%, No Religion 22.9%, Anglican 10.7% and Islam 10.3%.

==Notable people==

Murderer Ivan Milat lived here for a few years. In 1994 he was arrested and charged with multiple murders. The house he lived in was later sold.

<text>The Hump was the name given by Allied pilots in the Second World War to the eastern end of the Himalayan Mountains over which they flew military transport aircraft from India to China to resupply the Chinese war effort of Chiang Kai-shek and the units of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) based in China. Creating an airlift presented the USAAF a considerable challenge in 1942: it had no units trained or equipped for moving cargo, and there were no airfields in the China Burma India Theater (CBI) for basing the large number of transport aircraft that would be needed. Flying over the Himalayas was extremely dangerous and made more difficult by a lack of reliable charts, an absence of radio navigation aids, and a dearth of information about the weather.

The task was initially given to the USAAF&#x27;s Tenth Air Force, and then to its Air Transport Command (ATC). Because the USAAF had no previous airlift experience as a basis for planning, it assigned commanders who had been key figures in founding the ATC in 1941–1942 to build and direct the operation, which included former civilians with extensive executive experience operating civil air carriers.

Originally referred to as the &quot;India–China Ferry&quot;, the successive organizations responsible for carrying out the airlift were the &quot;Assam–Burma–China Command&quot; (April–July 1942) and the &quot;India-China Ferry Command&quot; (July–December 1942) of the Tenth Air Force; and the Air Transport Command&#x27;s &quot;India-China Wing&quot; (December 1942 – June 1944) and &quot;India-China Division&quot; (July 1944 – November 1945).

The operation began in April 1942, after Japanese forces blocked the Burma Road, and continued daily until scaled down from August 1945. It procured most of its officers, men, and equipment from the USAAF, augmented by British, British-Indian Army, Commonwealth forces, Burmese labor gangs and an air transport section of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). Final operations were flown in November 1945 to return personnel from China.

The India–China airlift delivered approximately 650,000 tons of materiel to China at great cost in men and aircraft during its 42-month history. For its efforts and sacrifices, the India–China Wing of the ATC was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation on 29 January 1944 at the personal direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the first such award made to a non-combat organization.

==Background: the China supply dilemma==
Success of the &quot;Europe first&quot; strategy of the Allies entailed keeping China in the war, tying down more than a million Japanese troops who might otherwise threaten the Allied strategic offensive in the Pacific. The Japanese invasion of French Indochina closed all sea and rail access routes for supplying China with materiel except through Turkestan in the Soviet Union. That access ended following the signing of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and the Burma Road became the only land route. The rapid success of Japanese military operations in Southeast Asia threatened this lifeline, prompting discussion of an air cargo service route from India as early as January 1942. Chiang&#x27;s foreign minister, T. V. Soong, estimated that 12,000 tons of materiel could be delivered monthly by air from India if 100 C-47 Skytrain-type transports were committed to an airlift. Chinese Air Force Major General Mao Bangchu was tasked with leading the exploration of suitable air-routes over the dangerous Himalayas in 1941, and CNAC pilot Xia Pu recorded the first flight from Dinjan, India, to Kunming, China, during November of that year in what was to become the route now known as &quot;the &quot;Hump&quot;&quot;.

On 25 February 1942, President Roosevelt wrote to General George C. Marshall that &quot;it is of the utmost urgency that the pathway to China be kept open&quot;, and committed ten C-53 Skytrooper transports for lend-lease delivery to CNAC to build its capability to 25 aircraft. When the newly created Tenth Air Force opened its headquarters in New Delhi under the command of Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton in March 1942, it was assigned the responsibility of developing an &quot;India-China Ferry&quot; using both U.S. and Chinese aircraft. Although he was never given command authority over aircraft or personnel, the officer responsible for the India-China Ferry was Brereton&#x27;s chief of staff Brig. Gen. Earl L. Naiden, who held that responsibility until mid-August.

From its onset, the air route was predicated on operating two branches, unofficially deemed &quot;commands&quot;: a &quot;Trans-India Command&quot; from India&#x27;s western ports to Calcutta, where cargo would be transshipped by rail to Assam; and the &quot;Assam-Burma-China Command&quot;, a route from bases in Assam to southern China. The original scheme envisioned the Allies holding northern Burma and using Myitkyina as an offloading terminal to send supplies by barge downriver to Bhamo and transfer to the Burma Road. However, on 8 May 1942 the Japanese seized Myitkyina which, coupled with the loss of Rangoon, effectively cut Allied access to the Burma Road. To maintain the uninterrupted supply to China, U.S. and other allied leaders agreed to organize a continual aerial resupply effort directly between Assam and Kunming.

==Airlift history==
===Haynes, 1942===
Tenth Air Force was hampered by a constant diversion of men and aircraft to Egypt, where Nazi Germany was threatening to seize the Suez Canal. Its Air Service Command was still en route by ship from the United States, forcing it to get aircraft and personnel for the India-China Ferry from any available source. Ten former Pan American World Airways DC-3s and flight crews were sent from the trans-Africa ferry route to outfit the new operation. 25 other DC-3s requisitioned from American Airlines in the United States could not be moved to India due to lack of crews, and were later integrated into the complement of the first transport group committed to the airlift.

The command structure of the India-China Ferry was fractured after senior officers in India and Burma made competing claims for jurisdiction, with part of the authority given to Gen. Joseph Stilwell as CBI theater commander and part remaining with Tenth Air Force, which had also been ordered by Marshall to &quot;co-operate when requested&quot; with the British in defending India. Movement by ground transport of supplies arriving from the United States at the port of Karachi to the airfields, as well as construction of the infrastructure required to support the operation, was the responsibility of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Services of Supply, commanded in the CBI by Maj. Gen. Raymond A. Wheeler. The airlift was the final leg of a journey of from Los Angeles to China often taking four months.

On 23 April 1942, Colonel Caleb V. Haynes, a prospective bombardment group commander, was assigned to command the Assam-Kunming branch of the India-China Ferry, dubbed the &quot;Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command&quot;. Col. Robert L. Scott, a pursuit pilot awaiting an assignment in China, was assigned as his operations officer and a month later as executive officer. Haynes was a fortuitous choice to be the airlift&#x27;s first commander, as he had just completed an assignment as a key subordinate of Brig. Gen. Robert Olds. Olds and his staff had founded the Air Corps Ferrying Command in June 1941 and pioneered overseas military air transport, including use of the South Atlantic air route by which aircraft, personnel, and cargo would reach India from the United States. However, at the time the India-China Ferry was conceived, the ABC Ferry Command was not prepared to plan, control, or execute such an operation. Its formal organization was minimal, it had no units of its own, and its few aircraft were committed to establishing air transport routes. By June, however, the ABC Ferry Command had begun a greatly expanded wartime restructuring, and became the Air Transport Command on 1 July.

The first mission &quot;over the hump&quot; took place on 8 April 1942. Flying from the Royal Air Force airfield at Dinjan, Lt. Col. William D. Old used a pair of the former Pan Am DC-3s to ferry of aviation fuel intended to resupply the Doolittle Raiders. The collapse of Allied resistance in northern Burma in May 1942 meant further diversion of the already minuscule air effort. The ABC Ferry Command resupplied Stilwell&#x27;s retreating army and evacuated its wounded, while establishing a regular air service to China using ten borrowed DC-3s, three USAAF C-47s, and 13 CNAC C-53s and C-39s. Only two-thirds of the aircraft were serviceable at any time. Dinjan was within range of Japanese fighters now based at Myitkyina, forcing all-night maintenance operations and pre-dawn takeoffs of the defenseless supply planes. The threat of interception also forced the ABC Ferry Command to fly a difficult route to China over the Eastern Himalayan Uplift, which came to be known as the &quot;high hump&quot;, or more simply, &quot;The Hump&quot;.

The official history of the Army Air Forces states:

Unfavorable weather conditions along the route were a major contributing factor to its difficulty:
The point of view of a veteran crewman who flew the Hump was described in a feature story for a local newspaper years after:

Innumerable problems with the Indian railway system meant that aircraft assigned to the airlift often carried their cargo all the way from Karachi to China, while much cargo took as long to reach Assam from Karachi as the two-month journey by ship from the United States. India&#x27;s highway and river systems were so undeveloped as to be unable to support the mission, leaving air as the only practicable way to supply China in anything resembling a timely fashion.

The first crews and aircraft from the United States went to the 1st Ferrying Group, arriving on 17 May at their base at the New Malir Cantonment near Karachi. The group was activated in India in March without personnel or equipment and was assigned to the operational control of the Tenth Air Force over the objections of the commander of ATC, who feared that its planes and crews would be steered into combat units, which did in fact occur at times. Aircraft continued to arrive in small increments through October with flight crews consisting of airline pilots holding Air Corps Reserve commissions who had been called up for active duty specifically for the India-China assignment, and navigators, engineers and radiomen from the USAAF technical training schools. For the remainder of 1942, the 62 C-47s of the 1st Ferrying Group were the backbone of the airlift, flying both branches of the operation from Karachi until August, when it began a three months&#x27; relocation to Assam.

In the first two months of the airlift the USAAF delivered only 700 tons of cargo and CNAC only 112 tons, and tonnage fell for both June and July, mostly due to the full onset of the summer monsoon. In July, CNAC quadrupled its tonnage to 221 tons, but 10AF C-47s brought only 85 net tons of materiel and personnel into China.

===Tate, 1942===
On 17 June 1942, Haynes continued on to China to take up an assignment as bomber commander of the China Air Task Force, Tenth Air Force&#x27;s eastern appendage commanded by Brig. Gen. Claire L. Chennault. Scott was left in command for several days before he too was ordered to China to command the first U.S. fighter group in the CATF. On 22 June Col. Robert F. Tate (who like Haynes was a bombardment officer) was named to replace Haynes, but he was also in charge of the Trans-India Command in Karachi and remained in that capacity. Lt. Col. Julian M. Joplin, acting at the direction of Naiden, for all practical purposes commanded India-China operations until 18 August. Tate took actual command on 25 August, when Naiden was forced to return to the United States, although like Naiden he delegated direction of airlift operations to Joplin. Effective 15 July 1942, the two branches of the India-China Ferry merged into the &quot;India-China Ferry Command&quot;, an organized component of the Tenth Air Force.

Tate was immediately and severely handicapped when the best pilots and 12 aircraft of the airlift went west to Egypt with Brereton on 26 June. Despite the use of the 1st Ferrying Group, the buildup of the airlift grew very slowly during the summer monsoon. Overuse of the small number of aircraft available, spotty maintenance, and a lack of spare parts led to numerous groundings until overhauls could be effected. In particular the lack of replacement tires and spare engines held down operations even after eight of the C-47s sent to the Middle East returned in August. For a short time engines intended for P-43 fighters of the Chinese Air Force were adapted for use on C-47s, but the supply of those proved small.

Although three bases constructed by the British on tea plantations at Chabua, Mohanbari, and Sookerating were declared operational in August 1942, and construction of a fourth began at Jorhat, none were expected to be ready for all-weather operations before November or December because of problems with unskilled indigenous labor and the failure of promised heavy equipment to arrive from the United States. Throughout the monsoon rains Dinjan remained the chief transport base. The dismal results of the India-China Ferry to this point led to a proposal in Washington to turn over control of the operation entirely to CNAC, which would place U.S. military personnel in a combat area under foreign civilian control. Stilwell vigorously and successfully opposed the plan. He reinforced his position by insisting that CNAC lease its C-53s and crews participating in the airlift to the USAAF to assure that they would carry only essential cargo and not commercial activity. Losses of transports increased sharply, with the airlift&#x27;s first loss to accident on 23 September 1942, presumably from icing.

Protection of the aerial supply line became the primary mission of the Tenth Air Force. When the summer monsoon ended, the Japanese were expected to try to sever the last remaining connection to China, and although 10AF&#x27;s CATF was adequate for the defense of the eastern end, little had been done to create an antiaircraft defense around the four Assam airfields. The 51st Fighter Group was nominally responsible for fighter protection, but two of its three squadrons had been stripped of their aircraft and personnel in July to equip the group&#x27;s third squadron and round out the newly activated 23rd Fighter Group, both in China with the CATF. The 51st FG remained in Karachi awaiting aircraft and personnel. Requests for more antiaircraft guns, a weather squadron, and radios and landline communications equipment for an early warning system were immediately approved but went unfulfilled for a variety of reasons. The India Air Task Force, the western combat force of the Tenth Air Force, was activated on 3 October with nine squadrons, none fully operational. Haynes was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command. The 51st FG had been re-equipped with P-40s, but had trained pilots sufficient for only one squadron, which Haynes sent to Dinjan.

The long-anticipated air attack by the Japanese took place late in the afternoon of 25 October. 100 bombers and fighters, bombing from and strafing from , achieved complete surprise. The only defense provided came from three P-40s aloft on patrol, and six others which took off and gave pursuit. Dinjan and Chabua were heavily bombed, with nine transports and twenty fighters destroyed or badly damaged by low-level strafing. The next day Sookerating was strafed by 30 fighters, again without warning, but damage was confined to a single storage building containing food and medical supplies. A third raid struck Chabua on 28 October but missed the field entirely. The India Air Task Force had flown reconnaissance missions over the captured airfield at Myitkyina all summer, but the Japanese mounted the raids from Lashio or bases in southern Burma, equipping their fighters with external fuel tanks.

Haynes responded by moving the other squadron of the 51st FG to Sookerating, while the China Air Task Force was ordered to launch a series of attacks by B-25s against Lashio. While Chennault complied, he did not believe that the Japanese strikes originated there and the rift between him and Tenth Air Force grew wider. Whatever the case, the Japanese raids were not repeated in 1942. In June 1943, following small, sporadic raids during the dry season, the entire fighter strength of the India Air task Force, amounting to less than 100 P-40s, was organized as the Assam American Air Base Command (later the 5320th Air Defense Wing, Provisional), specifically to protect the Assam airfields.

===Alexander, 1942–43===
The airlift was evaluated by the USAAF in October 1942 and the attitudes of Tenth Air Force&#x27;s commanders regarding the feasibility of the operation were characterized as &quot;defeatist&quot;. Living conditions for airlift flight crews and support personnel, particularly at Dinjan, were described as &quot;by far the worst in the entire theater&quot;, with primitive quarters, poor sanitation, bad food and mess facilities, pervasive disease, and lack of recreation. Apathy became widespread and morale dropped to a &quot;dangerous point,&quot; with the feeling among the troops that as part of the Tenth Air Force, they were &quot;illegitimate children&quot;.

After reviewing the evaluation, the Air Transport Command on 13 October offered to take over the operation. Eight days later it was instructed to do so effective 1 December 1942, and activated the &quot;India-China Wing ATC&quot; (ICWATC), commanded by Col. (later Brig. Gen.) Edward H. Alexander, who was Stilwell&#x27;s air officer. Like Haynes, Alexander had been a founding member of ATC in 1941 as executive officer of the Ferrying Command. ICW reported directly to ATC&#x27;s chief of staff in Washington, D.C., Col. (later Maj. Gen. and ATC deputy commander) Cyrus R. Smith (under the supervision of Headquarters USAAF), ending the division of authority under which the India-China Ferry Command had labored. The 1st Ferrying Group was returned to ATC and redesignated the 1st Transport Group. Its 76 C-47s were augmented in January 1943 by the addition of three Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express transports (a derivative of the B-24 Liberator), which increased to 11 in March and a projected total of 50 by the end of the summer.

USAAF Commanding General Henry H. Arnold observed first-hand the hazards of &quot;flying the Hump&quot; in February 1943 when the combat crew flying &quot;Argonaut&quot;, the B-17 that transported his party, became lost as they flew to Kunming following the Casablanca Conference. From his experiences, Arnold later wrote:

With the onset of heavy monsoon rains in March the ATC operation was reduced to operating from the only all-weather base at Chabua (the RAF base at Dinjan was now occupied by CNAC and Tenth Air Force&#x27;s only P-40 group), but with a critical shortage in flight crews, even ATC&#x27;s modest goal of 4,000 tons a month was impossible to attain. The 308th Bombardment Group reached its base at Kunming on 31 March 1943 and began two months of &quot;reverse Hump&quot; operations, flying round trips to India to acquire the gasoline, bombs, parts and other materiel it needed to stockpile before flying combat missions. Using kits developed by the South India Air Service Command Depot, it converted its B-24 Liberators into fuel transports to accomplish the task. The 308th used Chabua airfield was already crowded with more than 80 ICW transports, and its lightly constructed runway was soon &quot;going to pieces&quot; under the weight of the bombers. Jorhat had stronger runways but its taxiways were still unpaved, making it unsuitable for four-engined aircraft. Both Sookerating and Mohanbari were due to have strong concrete runways capable of handling all aircraft, but neither was yet paved and monsoon rains made them inoperable.

The first of thirty Curtiss C-46 Commandos (an unproven cargo transport whose performance was significantly superior to the C-47&#x27;s in cargo capacity and ceiling) arrived in India on 21 April 1943. In May the 22nd Ferrying Group began C-46 operations from the still uncompleted base at Jorhat, which had a concrete runway. In June, although the British—and later the U.S. Army&#x27;s Services of Supply—failed to complete construction of all-weather runways at Mohanbari and Sookerating, the activation of the 28th, 29th, and 30th Transport Groups proceeded, an attempt to expand the C-46&#x27;s role to meet projected levels of tonnage.

The severe shortage of crews led to pleas from Alexander for additional personnel. &quot;Project 7&quot; was set up by ATC at the end of June to fly nearly 2,000 men, 50 transports and 120 tons of materiel from Florida to India. Despite this, July&#x27;s tonnage was less than half of its goal. The airfields were nowhere near completion, nearly all of the new pilots had been single-engine instructor pilots, specialized maintenance personnel and equipment had been sent by ship, and the complexities of the new C-46 (&quot;see Transport shortcomings below&quot;) had become evident. Scorching heat and torrential rains of the summer monsoon completed the undermining of the ambitious goals. The long-delayed work on existing fields resulted in intervention by Marshall in which he ordered Wheeler to have the Services of Supply complete the work by 1 July and issued a deadline of 1 September 1943 to have three additional fields ready for operations, but airfield construction problems were not overcome for several months.

===Hoag and Hardin, 1943–44===
At his meeting with Arnold, Chiang warned that the price of China&#x27;s cooperation with Stilwell to reconquer Burma was a 500-plane air force and delivery by the airlift of 10,000 tons a month. In May 1943, at the Trident Conference, President Roosevelt ordered ATC to deliver 5,000 tons a month to China by July; 7,500 tons by August; and 10,000 tons by September 1943. This came about as Marshall and Arnold sent Maj. Gen. George E. Stratemeyer, the Chief of Air Staff, on a special mission to India to observe ICWATC operations and report back with recommendations. Similarly, Eddie Rickenbacker flew the Hump in a C-87 to reach China during his fact-finding mission to the Far East and the Soviet Union, and both he and Stratemeyer found ICW&#x27;s performance seriously deficient. While ICW was carrying more tonnage by virtue of having nearly ten times as many aircraft as CNAC, half of them with a larger load capacity, the Chinese carrier was far more efficient in tonnage lifted per aircraft, by a factor of 2.5 to 1. The primary cause of ATC&#x27;s failure was the complete inadequacy of its airfield facilities, but other major factors were unsatisfactory performance by overwhelmed aircraft maintenance personnel that grounded a hundred ATC aircraft per day, a predominance of inexperienced pilots (particularly compared to those of CNAC), and a dearth of radio and navigation aids in ATC transports. Rickenbacker and Tenth Air Force commanding general Clayton L. Bissell recommended return of the operation to theater command, but Stratemeyer disagreed, as did Maj. Gen. Howard C. Davidson, who was about to replace Bissell in command of 10AF and had made an inspection tour of his own in June.

Frustration at the failure of the ICW to meet the Trident goals led Arnold to dispatch another inspection team to India in September 1943, led by ATC commander Maj. Gen. Harold L. George. Accompanying George was Col. Thomas O. Hardin, an aggressive former airline executive who had already been overseas a year as head of ATC&#x27;s Central African Sector. On 16 September, George immediately reassigned Hardin to command the new Eastern Sector of the ICW, to invigorate India-China operations. Alexander was replaced in command of the ICW by Brig. Gen. Earl S. Hoag on 15 October. In addition to the changes in command, George instituted the &quot;Fireball&quot;, a weekly C-87 express flight (see External links for photo essay) by the 26th Transport Group carrying critical spare parts for the transports from the Air Service Command Depot at Fairfield, Ohio, to the ATC service depot at Agra, India.

Japanese fighters based in central Burma began to challenge the transport route near Sumprabum at the end of the summer monsoon. On 13 October 1943, a large number of Japanese fighters assisted by ground observers evaded U.S. fighter patrols and shot down a C-46, a C-87, and a CNAC transport while damaging three others. Despite the doubling of U.S. fighter patrols, similar interceptions on 20, 23, and 27 October shot down five more C-46s. Japanese pilots referred to the shooting down of vulnerable transport aircraft as &quot;tsuji-giri&quot; (&quot;cutting down a casually met stranger&quot;) or &quot;akago no te wo hineru&quot; (&quot;twisting a baby&#x27;s arm&quot;). On the last of the interceptions a formation of B-24s on a reverse Hump mission, mistaken for C-87s, claimed eight fighters shot down. Tenth Air Force immediately began attacks on Japanese airfields (Myitkyina was attacked 14 times before the end of the year, mostly by strafers and P-40s using 1000-lb bombs), and ICW moved its route to Kunming even farther north. Only two more C-46s were shot down during the remainder of 1943, both in December.

20 Japanese bombers escorted by 25 fighters bombed the Assam airfields on 13 December 1943 after several days of probing the early warning system without making an attack. Despite an increase in fighter patrols and an alarm issued, the defenders had only twelve minutes warning. U.S. interceptors were unable to climb to the altitude of the bombers in time to prevent the bombing, but it only caused slight damage. The raiding force was pursued and attacked, then ran head-on into fighter patrols returning from northern Burma. Serious losses to the raiders apparently convinced the Japanese not to repeat the attacks.

Hardin altered operations by introducing night missions and refusing to cancel scheduled flights because of adverse weather or threat of interception. Although losses to accidents and enemy action increased, and replacements for the high number of C-46s lost ceased entirely for two months, tonnage delivered rose sharply. The operation finally surpassed its objective in December with over 12,500 tons delivered to Kunming after new C-46s loaded with much-needed C-46 spare parts began arriving in numbers. By the end of 1943, Hardin had 142 aircraft in operation: 93 C-46, 24 C-87, and 25 C-47.

President Roosevelt directed that the Presidential Unit Citation be awarded to the India-China Wing in recognition of their service. Hardin was given a month&#x27;s leave in the United States, promoted to brigadier general, and as the representative of the wing received the award from General Arnold on 29 January 1944, the first awarded to a non-combat unit. Hardin returned to the India China Wing in February 1944, just as the first of a trickle of four-engined Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports arrived in theater (&quot;see Operations on the low hump and in China below&quot;). With a maximum load ceiling of only 12,000 feet the C-54s were unable to hurdle the high Hump. Japanese interceptors blocked use of eastbound routes at lower altitudes and the C-54s were limited for the time being to freight movement within India or flights between the CBI and the continental United States.

Hardin advanced to command of the ICW on 21 March 1944 when Hoag was transferred to head ATC&#x27;s European Wing. A month later, to give Hardin closer personal contact with his growing number of airbases, ICW changed its headquarters from New Delhi to Rishra, north of Calcutta. There, on the site of the Hastings Jute Mill, Stratemeyer, now a lieutenant general and commander of all USAAF forces in the CBI, established Hastings Army Air Base as the headquarters of the Army Air Forces India-Burma Theater, using a converted mill building to house his headquarters, that of CBI Air Service Command, and ICWATC. Under Hardin, tonnages increased, but so did expectations and frustrations; morale and safety concerns continued to plague the operation. In the first 54 days of 1944, 47 transports were lost. One transport was being lost for every 218 flights, an accident rate of 1.968 planes lost per thousand hours, of one life for every 162 trips flown or 340 tons delivered.

In June 1944, after the capture of the Japanese fighter base at Myitkyina and at the behest of Brig. Gen. William H. Tunner, Col. Andrew B. Cannon was assigned to command the Assam Wing when it was activated the next month. Tunner, who was to become airlift commander following Hardin, anticipated that the end of the fighter threat would see a massive influx of C-54s into the India-China operation. Like Haynes, Alexander, and Tunner, Cannon had been a pioneer in the Air Transport Command, where as a protege of Tunner&#x27;s he was base commander of Long Beach Army Air Field, where Tunner made his headquarters as commander of ATC&#x27;s Ferry Division, and commanding officer of the 6th Ferrying Group. On 1 July, ATC reorganized its nine wings worldwide into air divisions, and sectors into wings. The ICW-ATC became the &quot;India China Division ATC&quot; (ICD-ATC), while the Eastern Sector, carrying out the India-China airlift, was re-designated the &quot;Assam Wing&quot;, and the Western Sector support organization became the &quot;India Wing&quot;. The India China Division also had an operational training unit at Gaya and used the service depots of the China-Burma-India Air Service Command at Panagarh, Agra, and Bangalore.

Systems for identifying units and organizations assigned to the airlift changed several times between 1942 and 1945. The final change occurred on 1 August 1944 when the Air Transport Command discontinued the use of station numbers to identify its units and designated them as numbered &quot;USAAF Base Units&quot; with parenthetical modifiers describing their function. USAAF base units collectively identified all permanent party organizations, including flying units, at any particular non-combat base. The flying units were commonly denoted as lettered squadrons, i.e. &quot;Squadron B&quot;, within the Base Unit. To illustrate the various organizational changes affecting the India-China airlift, the unit at Chabua under 10AF deployed overseas as the &quot;1st Ferrying Group&quot;. It was redesignated the &quot;1st Transport Group&quot; on 1 December 1942 to denote that it was an ATC unit. Next it became &quot;Station No. 6 (APO 629 New York)&quot; on 1 December 1943 when for flexibility ATC no longer fielded groups or squadrons as units. Finally it became the &quot;1333rd USAAF Base Unit (Foreign Transport Station)&quot; on 1 August 1944 in conformance with USAAF policy service-wide. Similarly, &quot;Headquarters Squadron, Eastern Sector, India-China Wing&quot;, established at Chabua on 16 September 1943 to administer the headquarters of the airlift, was redesignated the &quot;Headquarters Squadron, Assam Wing&quot; on 1 July 1944 when ATC reorganized itself into &quot;divisions&quot; and &quot;wings&quot;; and &quot;Squadron A, 1325th USAAF Base Unit (HQ Assam Wing)&quot; on 1 August 1944.

===Tunner, 1944–45===
Hardin was brought back to the United States after spending two years overseas and command of the India-China Division went next to Tunner. Selected in the spring of 1944 to succeed Hardin, he chose his key staff and made a theater inspection trip in June that included piloting a C-46 over the Hump. He took command on 4 September 1944 with orders not just to increase the tonnage delivered, but also to reduce the numbers of lives and aircraft lost in accidents, and to improve morale in the India-China Division. Tunner and his staff, using a &quot;big business&quot; approach, completely turned around the operation, improved morale, and cut the aircraft loss ratio in half while doubling the amount of cargo delivered.

Tunner made extensive use of over 47,000 local laborers and utilized at least one elephant to lift 55-gallon fuel drums into the aircraft. A daily direct flight called the &quot;Trojan&quot;, flown by select C-54 crews, carried a minimum of five tons of highest priority materiel or passengers between Calcutta and Kunming, then brought back critically wounded patients or aircraft engines needing overhaul. Each base was assigned both daily and monthly tonnage quotas to move over the Hump based on the type of aircraft it operated and its distance from the &quot;Chinaside&quot; airfields, as the crews referred to their destinations. Tunner immediately reinstituted military standards of dress, decorum (including inspections and parades), and behavior that had become slack in the previous year, for which he earned the nickname &quot;Willie the Whip&quot;.

In Tunner&#x27;s first month of command, although the ICD delivered 22,314 tons to China, it still incurred an accident rate of 0.682 per thousand hours of flight. By January 1945, Tunner&#x27;s division had 249 aircraft and 17,000 personnel. It delivered more than 44,000 tons of cargo and passengers to China that month at an aircraft availability rate of 75%, but incurred 23 fatal crashes with 36 crewmen killed. On 6 January a particularly fierce winter storm blew across the Himalayas from west to east, increasing the time of westbound trips by one hour, and caused 14 CNAC and ATC transports to be lost or written off, with 42 crewmen missing, the highest one-day loss of the operation. The accident toll increased in the two months that followed, with 69 planes lost and 95 crewmen killed.

To reduce losses due to mechanical failure, in February 1945 Tunner introduced a maintenance program termed Production Line Maintenance. PLM consisted of having each aircraft due for 50- or 200-hour maintenance towed through five to seven maintenance stations, depending on whether or not an engine change was required. Each station had a fresh maintenance crew trained for a specific service task, including engine run up, inspections, cleaning, technical repair, and servicing, a process that took nearly a full 24-hour day per aircraft to complete. Each base specialized in only one type of aircraft to simplify the process. Despite initial resistance, PLM was successfully implemented throughout the division.

Tunner also adopted two measures to lower the number of air mishaps due to inexperience and crew fatigue. To accomplish the first, he appointed Lt. Col. Robert D. &quot;Red&quot; Forman as division training officer to oversee both stringent training and a flying safety program led by Capt. Arthur Norden. After 15 March 1945, the program intensified when Major John J. Murdock, Jr., took over the position of division flying safety officer. Tunner also altered the personnel rotation policy of the ICD, which he saw as a major contributor to crew fatigue. Before Tunner took command, a pilot was rotated back to the United States after completing 650 flight hours over the Hump. Many pilots took advantage of this by flying daily, accumulating the required hours in as little as four months (average about 37 hours in the air every week). But these pilots overworked themselves; the division flight surgeon reported that half of all crewmen suffered from operational fatigue. So, from 1 March 1945, Tunner required all personnel to be in theater for twelve months to be eligible for rotation, which discouraged over-scheduling; he also increased the number of flight hours required to 750.

Under Tunner, the India-China Division expanded to four wings in December 1944. The expansion was necessary to control the multiplicity of USAAF Base Units created as more airfields were opened. In addition to the Assam and India Wings, ICD added the &quot;Bengal Wing&quot;, headquartered at Tezgaon, to control C-54 operations, and the &quot;China Wing&quot; at Kunming. Tunner shifted his veteran commanders to provide leadership to the new wings. Cannon switched to the Bengal Wing, while Col. Richard F. Bromiley moved from the India Wing to the China Wing. Col. George D. &quot;Lonnie&quot; Campbell, Jr. succeeded to command of the Assam Wing.

Both the accident rate and the raw number of accidents decreased notably as a result of these measures with the exception of the C-87/C-109 types, which remained 500% higher than on the C-54. Tunner called for their replacement entirely by C-54s and plans were drawn up to increase the Skymaster force to 272 by October 1945 and 540 by April 1946. With a fleet of 410 C-46s augmenting the ICD, the tonnage lift capability over the Hump was predicted to become more than 86,000 tons per month. A shortage of C-54 engines hampered the plan, which was modified to have a quarter of the force always in a pipeline between India and Florida for engine changes, carrying cargo and passengers as they traveled in both directions. The modified plan was approved in April 1945 and Morrison Field, Florida, was chosen for the maintenance but it proved an impediment to success when C-54s sent there remained at the field for periods five times the seven days originally estimated for turnaround.

In July 1945, the last full month of operations, 662 aircraft of the India-China airlift delivered 71,042 tons, ICD&#x27;s maximum monthly tonnage. Of this fleet, 332 were ICD transports, but 261 were combat aircraft from USAAF units temporarily assigned to the airlift. An average of 332 flights to China was scheduled daily. The India-China Division ATC had 34,000 USAAF personnel assigned, and including indigenous civilians of all nationalities employed in India, Burma, and China, 84,000 persons overall. It boasted an aircraft availability rate of more than 85%. ICD suffered 23 major accidents in July, with 37 crewmen killed, but the Hump accident rate declined to .358 aircraft per thousand hours of flight in July (one-fifth of what it had been in January 1944) and .239 in August.

On 1 August 1945, to celebrate &quot;Air Force Day&quot;, ICD laid on its largest mission of the airlift. Tunner wrote that ICD flew 1,118 round-trip sorties, averaging two per aircraft, and one C-54 logged three round trips in hours of operations. 5,327 tons were delivered in one day without fatality, and with no major accidents. C-87s and C-109s carried 15% of the tonnage without mishap. Before the month ended, nearly 50,000 more tons were delivered. Eight major accidents resulted in only 11 deaths, at a rate of one death for every 2,925 trips (1/18 of what it had been in January 1944). The major accident rate of only 0.18 aircraft lost per 1000 hours was one-third of what it had been when Tunner took command, and one-eighth of that of January 1944.

He considered ICD&#x27;s safety record to be his greatest achievement. In his memoir &quot;Over the Hump&quot;, Tunner wrote:

Tunner commanded the division until 10 November 1945. The deputy commander of ICD, former bomber commander Brig. Gen. Charles W. Lawrence, briefly commanded the division before it was disbanded on 15 November 1945.

==Operations on the low hump and in China==
The first significant diversion of India-China Wing resources to operations in the region other than the Hump airlift began in February 1944. The Japanese attack in Arakan, followed by an offensive against Imphal in March and April, resulted in assistance to the British that Hardin estimated reduced hump deliveries by 1,200 tons. The ICW also had a stake in resistance to the offensive because the threat to Imphal imperiled the Assam-Bengal railroad along which not just Hump cargo but fuel for the airlift passed. The crisis occasioned by the Japanese attack on Imphal led Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander-in-chief of the Allied South East Asia Command, to request 38 C-47 aircraft to reinforce Imphal. Mountbatten had no authority to divert planes from the Hump, but he was backed up by two of the principal American commanders in the theater: Major General Daniel I. Sultan, the deputy commander of the CBI Theater, and Stratemeyer, who in addition to all his other duties commanded SEAC&#x27;s Eastern Air Command, which for all practical purposes made him Mountbatten&#x27;s air commander. After the request was approved, ICW provided 25 C-46s as the equivalent of 38 C-47s. These were attached to the EAC Troop Carrier Command to support the British and were used to fly the personnel and light equipment of the 5th Indian Division to Imphal and Dimapur, where it arrived in time to thwart the Japanese offensive.

The next month, to reinforce Stilwell&#x27;s planned offensive into Burma, the ICW flew 18,000 Chinese troops west across the Hump to Sookerating, which resulted in a net reduction to the India-China effort of at least 1,500 tons. However, the capture in May 1944 of Myitkyina airfield by American and Chinese troops of Stilwell&#x27;s command deprived the Japanese of their principal fighter airfield threatening Allied aircraft flying the Hump. The field immediately became an emergency landing strip for Allied aircraft even though fighting continued in Myitkyina town until August 1944. ICD continued its contribution to this success by flying in from southern India a regimental-sized force of combat engineers and their support, including heavy equipment, for airfield construction. The capture of Myitkyina allowed ICD C-54s, which had ceiling limitations that precluded flying &quot;Route Able&quot; (the High Hump), the regular use of a second, more direct route, designated &quot;Route Baker&quot; but unofficially dubbed the &quot;Low Hump&quot;.

In October 1944, after Gen. Tunner took command of the India-China Division of Air Transport Command, increased numbers of C-54s, sometimes escorted by Allied fighters based at Myitkyina, greatly increased tonnage levels flown to China from India. The C-54, which could at ten tons carry five times the cargo load of the C-47 and twice that of the C-46, replaced both twin-engined transports as the primary lifter of the operation. The expansion of bases resulted in the formation of eastbound Routes Easy, Fox, Love, Nan, and Oboe, and of westbound Route King.

===Support of XX Bomber Command===
From April 1944 to January 1945, the India-China Division was also tasked with supporting Operation Matterhorn, the B-29 Superfortress strategic bombing campaign against Japan from forward bases around Chengtu in central China. Arnold originally envisioned Matterhorn units as being self-sustaining, bringing in their own fuel in hundreds of C-109s (&quot;see Transport shortcomings below&quot;) and other materiel using B-29s and 20 C-87s as their own &quot;air transport service&quot;. The concept proved to be flawed from the outset when the planned 300-bomber force was reduced to a single combat wing of 150 bombers before it left the United States. B-29s of the XX Bomber Command, stripped of guns and other equipment and fitted with four bomb bay tanks, were used as fuel tankers while tactical aircraft hauled other supplies, including bombs, but were unable to bring enough materiel over the Hump from their permanent bases around Calcutta in India to begin missions. XX BC turned to ICD for additional support when its target date for commencement of missions was repeatedly postponed.

ATC&#x27;s North African Wing had already provided stopgap support by transporting 250 spare B-29 engines to the CBI in April and May 1944, using 25 C-54s over a shuttle route from the port of Casablanca to Calcutta that came to be called the &quot;Crescent Blend&quot; until three special mission C-46 squadrons—created in early 1944 under the code name &quot;Moby Dick&quot;—were ready to carry out supply operations for XX Bomber Command. Designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Transport Squadrons (Mobile), each was intended to be a self-contained unit of twenty C-46s, flight crews, maintenance and engineering specialists, and a full complement of station operation personnel, although when first committed the service elements had not yet been integrated. They arrived in the CBI in June 1944, with the 1st and 2nd MATS based at Kalaikunda, West Bengal, taking over the &quot;Crescent Blend&quot; shuttle and bringing in over 100 spare engines per month, while the 3rd MATS was sent forward to the ICD base at Kunming to augment the India-China airlift.

Of 42,000 tons of materiel delivered before XX BC abandoned its China bases and returned to India, the ICD moved almost two-thirds. During the last three months of bombing operations from China, XX BC quickly phased out use of its B-29s to haul cargo, and ICD supplied all of XX Bomber Command&#x27;s materiel except bombs, which B-29s toted over the mountains in &quot;reverse Hump&quot; missions. Lt.Col. Robert S. McNamara created a statistical control section to create adjustable schedules that tracked the variable.

XX BC had the unfortunate coincidence of arriving in the theater just as the Japanese started a major offensive in East China to open a corridor for lines of communication to its forces in Indochina, seize the airfields of Chennault&#x27;s Fourteenth Air Force situated in that corridor, and possibly knock China out of the war. The load allocations that ICD had to commit to XX BC early on caused &quot;mutual recriminations&quot; between XX BC, ICD and Chennault, from whom most of the altered allocation tonnage was taken, with each blaming the other for problems that ensued. The Japanese offensive continued inexorably all summer and into the fall, threatening the efficacy if not the very existence of 14AF. Relations were never entirely smoothed with Chennault, but workable compromises were eventually fashioned by Stratemeyer, Hardin and Tunner to accomplish the tasks necessary to keep 14AF in the fight. Supplying Matterhorn during the concurrent crisis did have the positive effect of increasing the resources and effort committed to the airlift, and recognition by all involved that ICD was the only agency that could efficiently handle the logistics.

When ATC reorganized on 1 August, the MATS squadrons maintained a separate identity from the newly created USAAF Base Units, but each flew hundreds of Hump missions, delivering aviation fuel and engines. Because India-China operations were of extraordinary length from Kalaikunda—requiring an intermediate stop at Jorhat—its two squadrons were transferred to ICD when XX Bomber Command began planning the reduction of its operations in November 1944. On 30 October the 2nd MATS moved to Dergaon, East Bengal, and later to Luliang, China, where it was disbanded in June 1945 and became Squadron B, 1343rd USAAF Base Unit.

===Operations Grubworm and Rooster===
Because C-47s and C-46s which landed in China were temporarily beyond ATC control, they were constantly being diverted for local emergencies by Chennault&#x27;s and China Theater commander Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer&#x27;s forces, disrupting the flight crew rest and aircraft maintenance schedules necessary to maintain tonnage. To alleviate the situation and also provide the additional support needed by the combat forces, 50 C-47s and 20 C46s were permanently based in China after October 1944 for internal movement of cargo and to assist the India-China airlift when gaps in local scheduling permitted. Most of the remaining C-47s were eventually sent to bases in Burma and continued India-China missions over the lower routes. They proved their continuing usefulness by playing prominent roles in various support missions within China in 1944 and 1945.

Between 5 December 1944 and 5 January 1945, C-46s and crews were attached to the Tenth Air Force to augment &quot;Operation Grubworm&quot;. This was the relocation of the 14th and 22nd Chinese Divisions, located in reserve on the Stilwell Road near Myitkyina, to bases around Kunming. Chiang and Wedemeyer proposed to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, over the objections of Mountbatten, to relocate the divisions to counter a Japanese offensive seeking to capture the Kunming airfields. The operation was approved with the proviso that it not strain Tenth Air Force&#x27;s extensive air transport system supplying Allied ground operations in Burma. IDC provided the C-46s of the mobile air transport squadrons and all of its China Wing C-47s to provide the necessary augmentation.

The 2nd MATS moved in entirety from its base at Dergaon to Luliang Field, China, completing the deployment by December 13. The 1st MATS operated from Ledo, and ICD&#x27;s 1348th USAAF Base Unit at Myitkyina South airfield coordinated the entire operation and provided the staging base for refueling all transports. The C-46s moved the 14th Division from five airfields in Burma, including a field at Nansin whose construction was completed December 4. Takeoffs there were subject to artillery and sniper fire. The 1348th Base Unit scheduled operations 24 hours a day and in bad weather, although the operation was suspended between 16 and 22 December when the situation in China seemed improved. Of the six pick-up fields, only Myitkyina South was capable of night operations, and troop carrier C-47s were used to shuttle troops there during the day for ICD aircraft to fly over the Hump at night.

The mobile air transport squadrons were familiar with the Burma airfields and so were selected to fly the operation. Showing unusual flexibility in planning, the 1348th Base Unit quartered incoming troops near airfields, supplied them, monitored the availability of aircraft and crews, divided the troops into planeloads, and kept Chinese units and their materiel intact. Briefings and fuelings were conducted at Myitkyina South, the planes flew to their pickup fields and loaded, and then flew back to Myitkyina South for a final refueling before flying on to China. The 1348th Base Unit control tower performed all air traffic control of aircraft to and from China.

Grubworm lifted 25,009 Chinese troops, 396 Americans, 1,596 draft animals, 42 jeeps and 144 pieces of artillery in 24 days of flying. ICD crews provided 597 of the 1328 sorties of the operation and moved more than 14,000 of the troops involved. Although three C-47s were lost during the operation, ICD had no losses. When the Japanese offensive shifted to seize the Fourteenth Air Force bases at Suichwan and Kanchow, the 2nd ATS evacuated the bases in a single day on 22 January.

Between March and May 1945, the ICD carried the first American combat troops into China when it redeployed the two American regiments of the MARS Task Force from Burma. In April, 50 C-47s and 30 C-46s of the ICD conducted &quot;Operation Rooster&quot;, transporting both divisions of the Chinese 6th Army from Kunming, where they had been delivered by &quot;Grubworm&quot;, to Chihkiang in the western Hsiang valley to reinforce the defense of the 14th AF base there. ICD flew 1,648 sorties, delivering 25,136 troops; 2,178 horses; and 1,565 tons of materiel; for a total of 5,523 tons. 369 tons of aviation gasoline was also carried to Chihkiang for 14th AF use

==Operational difficulties==
===Building a capability===
The task facing the Tenth Air Force of creating an airlift was daunting at minimum, emphasizing all that the Army Air Forces lacked in April 1942: no units tasked for moving cargo, no experience in organized airlift by the USAAF or its predecessor Air Corps, and no airfields for basing units. In addition, flying in the region was made more difficult by a lack of reliable charts, an absence of radio navigation aids, and a dearth of weather data.

In 1942 Chiang Kai-shek insisted that at least 7,500 tons per month were needed to keep his field divisions in operation, but this figure proved unattainable for the first fifteen months of the India-China airlift. The 7,500 total was first exceeded in August 1943, by which time objectives had been increased to 10,000 tons a month. Ultimately monthly requirements surpassed 50,000 tons.

Slowly, however, an airlift of unprecedented scale began to take shape. Construction of four new bases was begun in 1942, and by 1944 the operation flew from six all-weather airfields in Assam. By July 1945 the air corridor from India began at thirteen airfields strung out along the North-east Indian Railways in the Brahmaputra valley, with seven in Assam, four in the Bengal valley, and two near Calcutta, and terminated at six Chinaside airfields around Kunming.

Through July 1944 the flight corridor for the India-China airlift was fifty miles wide with a highly restrictive vertical clearance. As bases expanded and the Low Hump route came into use, the corridor widened to and 25 charted routes, with a vertical clearance of 10,000–25,000 MSL in the south, permitting highly congested but controlled operations at all hours.

===Transport shortcomings===
A critical problem proved to be finding a cargo aircraft capable of carrying heavy payloads at the high altitudes required, and three types were tried before the opening of a low Hump route permitted the use of C-54s: C-47 and variants, C-46, and C-87/C-109.

Initially, the India-China airlift was flown with the Douglas DC-3 and its military versions, the C-47, C-53 and C-39. However, the DC-3 design&#x27;s fuselage was so high off the ground that loading from most truck beds was difficult, and its narrow door and weak floor could not sustain heavy cargo. Although C-47s had reinforced flooring and a wider door, they still required specialized loading equipment for much of the cargo needed in China and had a limited payload capacity. Also, performance specifications of the Douglas transports were not suited to high-altitude operation with heavy payloads, and could not normally reach an altitude sufficient to clear the mountainous terrain, forcing the planes to attempt a highly dangerous route through the maze-like Himalayan passes.

The introduction in January 1943 of the Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express, a design modification of the B-24D heavy bomber, boosted tonnage figures. Its high-altitude capability enabled it to surmount the lower mountains (15,000–16000 feet MSL) without resorting to the passes, but the type had a high accident rate and was unsuited to the airfields then in use. Despite having four engines, the C-87 climbed poorly with heavy loads, as did its bomber counterparts, and often crashed on takeoff if an engine failed. Its poor cockpit illumination was inadequate for bad weather flying and often failed during instrument takeoffs, its electrical and hydraulic systems frequently froze at high altitude and malfunctioned, and its flight deck heating system was prone to produce either stifling heat or none at all. Attributed by its pilots to its slim Davis wing, the C-87 also had a tendency to spin out of control when encountering even mild icing conditions over the mountains. One Hump pilot called the variant &quot;an evil, bastard contraption&quot; and a &quot;ground-loving bitch&quot; that &quot;could not carry enough ice to chill a highball&quot;.

Despite its shortcomings, the C-87 was valued for the reliability of its engines, speed that enabled it to reduce significantly the effect of head and cross winds, a service ceiling that allowed it to surmount most weather fronts, and range that permitted its crews to fly &quot;pressure-front&quot; patterns that chased favorable winds.

Another Liberator transport variant, the C-109, carried gasoline in converted B-24Js or B-24Ls. All combat equipment was removed and eight flexible bag fuel tanks were installed inside the fuselage with a 2,900 U.S. gallon capacity. 70 were initially planned to fly the Hump with XX Bomber Command, beginning in September 1944, but most of the 218 C-109 conversions eventually served in the CBI under ATC after B-29 operations were shifted from China back to India. At least 80 were involved in major accidents between September 1944 and August 1945. Like the C-87, they were not popular with their crews, since they were very difficult to land when fully loaded, particularly at airfields above altitude such as Kunming, and often had unstable flight characteristics when all eight cargo tanks were full. A crash landing of a loaded C-109 inevitably resulted in an explosion and crew fatalities, earning it the nickname &quot;C-One-Oh-Boom&quot;.

The Curtiss C-46 Commando began to fly India-China missions in May 1943. The C-46 was a large twin-engine aircraft capable of flying faster and higher than any previous medium-range cargo aircraft, and could carry heavier loads than either the C-47 or the C-87, albeit at two and one half times the unit cost of a C-47. With the C-46, airlift tonnage increased significantly, surpassing objectives with 12,594 tons in December 1943. Loads continued to increase throughout 1944 and 1945, reaching an all-time maximum tonnage in July 1945. Performance of the Commando was enhanced when camouflage paint, standard on all USAAF aircraft until February 1944, was removed to reduce weight and provide five extra knots of speed.

While becoming the medium-range workhorse of the Hump airlift, the C-46 throughout its service experienced frequent mechanical failures (in particular, a tendency to engine failure and fuel leaks that puddled at the wing root to become an explosion hazard) that led to such unflattering sobriquets Air Force-wide as &quot;Dumbo&quot; and &quot;Plumber&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, and among ATC crews as the &quot;flying coffin&quot;. In its first five months of operations, 20% of the C-46s assigned to the airlift crashed. When it first arrived in theater, in addition to being accompanied by technical orders that required 50 field modifications before it could be flown operationally, the C-46 also required additional training for inexperienced crews, and a transition school was established that drained the airlift of ten aircraft and crews. Worse, spare parts were in such scarce supply until the fall of 1943 that 26 of the first 68 C-46s sent were out of commission.

===Flight hazards===
Flying over the Hump proved to be an extremely hazardous undertaking for Allied flight crews. The air route wound its way into the high mountains and deep gorges between north Burma and west China, where violent turbulence, 125 to winds, icing, and inclement weather conditions were a regular occurrence. Lack of suitable navigational equipment, radio beacons, and inadequate numbers of trained personnel (there were never enough navigators for all the groups) continually affected airlift operations.

In the first year of the airlift, inexperienced officers of the Services of Supply often ordered planes loaded until they were &quot;about full&quot;, ignorant of gross weight limitations or center of gravity placement, while most pilots were reserves recently called up from the airlines with little military transport experience and accustomed to civilian safety standards. As the airlift grew in size and scope in 1943, demands of tactical units and the failure of airline-conducted ATC training programs to produce sufficient multi-engined pilots limited nearly all reinforcement pilots to those just out of flight school or single-engine rated pilots from training fields who had relatively little instrument time. In December 1942, one-third of the 102 technical sergeant (non-commissioned officer) pilot training graduates of the Lubbock Field Class 42-I were immediately sent to India to fly the Hump as replacement co-pilots. This collective inexperience required ICW to create an in-theater OTU near Karachi to qualify new arrivals, taking 16 experienced pilots and eight to ten aircraft away from the airlift. CNAC pilots, while accustomed to a variety of aircraft, also had little instrument experience, and most were unfamiliar with the large American transport aircraft used in the airlift. Not until 1944, when the ATC recruited high hour civilian flight instructors released by the USAAF in pilot training program cutbacks, and the 3rd OTU at Reno Army Air Force Base (Nevada) turned out a growing number of C-46 crews, were highly qualified replacements more readily available for the airlift.

Still, American and CNAC pilots often flew daily on round-trip flights, and around the clock. Some exhausted crews flew as many as three roundtrips every day, particularly during the Hardin rotation policy. Mechanics serviced planes in the open, using tarpaulins to cover the engines during the frequent downpours, and suffered burns to exposed flesh from sun-heated bare metal. There were not enough mechanics or spare parts to go around during the first two years of operations; maintenance and engine overhauls were often deferred. Many overloaded planes crashed on takeoff after mechanical trouble such as an engine failure. Author and ATC pilot Ernest K. Gann recalled flying into Chabua and witnessing four air crashes in one day: two C-47s, two C-87s and 32 killed. He commented with grim sarcasm, &quot;Not to be confused with a combat operation.&quot; Due to the isolation of the area, as well as the lower priority of the CBI theater, parts and supplies to keep planes flying were in short supply before the onset of the &quot;Fireball&quot;, and flight crews were often sent into the Himalayan foothills to cannibalize aircraft parts from the numerous crash sites. At times, monthly aircraft losses totaled 50% of all aircraft then in service along the route. A byproduct of the numerous air crashes was a local boom in native wares made from aluminum crash debris.

In addition to losses from weather and mechanical failure, the unarmed and unescorted transport aircraft flying the Hump were occasionally attacked by Japanese fighters. While piloting a C-46 on one such mission, Lt. Wally A. Gayda returned fire in desperation against a fighter by pushing a Browning automatic rifle out the cockpit window and firing a full magazine, killing the Japanese pilot. Some C-87 pilots installed a pair of forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns fuselage-mounted in front of the cargo doors of their aircraft, but there is no documented instance of their being used.

===Search and rescue===
The high number of losses resulted in the formation at Jorhat in July 1943 of one of the first search and rescue organizations, nicknamed &quot;Blackie&#x27;s Gang&quot;. A former test pilot and a Hump veteran, Capt. John L. &quot;Blackie&quot; Porter directed the unit using C-47s borrowed from airlift units that were crewed by a dozen former barnstormers and enlisted personnel armed with submachine guns and hand grenades. &quot;Blackie&#x27;s Gang&quot; accounted for virtually every crewman recovered in 1943, including CBS News correspondent Eric Sevareid and 19 others forced to parachute on 2 August. The unit moved to Chabua on 25 October and was given official status and allotted two C-47s and several L-5 Sentinel liaison planes for rescue pickups. Porter recruited volunteer medics to parachute into crash sites to aid injured crewmen. In late November he added two B-25 Mitchells to his small fleet from aircraft that had been consigned to a salvage field. Porter was killed in action on 10 December 1943, when his B-25 was set on fire by Japanese Zero fighters during a search mission and crashed at the Indian border trying to return to base.

When Tunner took command of ICD, he was dissatisfied with the existing search-and-rescue set-up, deeming it &quot;a cowboy operation&quot;. He appointed the operations officer at Mohanbari, former Hump pilot Major Donald C. Pricer, to establish &quot;a thoroughgoing and efficient search and rescue organization&quot;. Pricer&#x27;s 90 men of the &quot;1352nd Base Unit (Search and Rescue)&quot; at Mohanbari used four B-25s, a C-47, and an L-5, painted yellow overall with blue wing bands for easy identification, to conduct the search missions. Pricer also charted all known crash sites to eliminate checking previous wrecks, and on occasion called upon a Sikorsky YR-4 helicopter based at Myitkyina to assist in rescue missions.

The &quot;Hump Express&quot;, in its last edition on 15 November 1945, reported:

The unit has been responsible for all search and rescue work from Bhamo, in Burma, north as far as allied planes regularly fly. Roughly, its jurisdiction extended from Tezpur, India to , China. Before organized search and rescue, crews had been lost for weeks, sometimes months. Stretches up to 90 days were not unknown in a country where jungle thickets and dizzy mountain trails made each hour a nightmare to the lost crews fighting their way out. But today, ICD&#x27;s unique outfit probably would have made the story a trifle less stark. Aerial supply drops of maps and pertinent homing information would have made the walk-out perhaps less circuitous, while certainly the hardships would have been alleviated by air-dropped medical supplies, food and clothing. S &amp; R members have parachuted to lost aircrews to furnish medical aid and walkout assistance. As a direct result of the unit&#x27;s work, the percentage of saved personnel steadily mounted and with it the confidence and assurance of ICD flight crews.

==Statistical summary of operations==
ATC operations accounted for 685,304 gross tons of cargo carried eastbound during hostilities, including 392,362 tons of gasoline and oil, with nearly 60% of that total delivered in 1945. ATC aircraft made 156,977 trips eastbound between 1 December 1943, and 31 August 1945, losing 373 aircraft. Though supplemented by the opening of the Ledo Road network in January 1945 and by the recapture of Rangoon, the airlift&#x27;s total tonnage of 650,000 net tons dwarfed that of the Ledo Road (147,000 tons). In addition to cargo, 33,400 persons were transported, in one or both directions.

CNAC pilots made a key contribution to India-China flight operations. Between 1942 and 1945, the Chinese received 100 transport aircraft from the United States: 77 C-47s and 23 C-46s. Of the eventual 776,532 gross tons and approximately 650,000 net tons transported over the Hump, CNAC pilots accounted for 75,000 tons (about 12%). The India-China airlift continued beyond the end of the war. The final missions of the ICD, made after most of its attached organizations had departed, were the transporting of 47,000 U.S. personnel west over The Hump from China to Karachi for return to the United States.

The maximum aircraft strength of the India-China Division, ATC (31 July 1945) was 640 aircraft: 230 C-46s, 167 C-47s, 132 C-54s, 67 C-87/C-109s, 33 B-25s, 10 L-5s, and 1 B-24.

Gen. Tunner&#x27;s final report stated that the airlift &quot;expended&quot; 594 aircraft. At least 468 American and 41 CNAC aircraft were known lost from all causes, with 1,314 air crewmen and passengers killed. In addition, 81 more aircraft were never accounted for, with their 345 personnel listed as missing. Another 1,200 personnel had been rescued or walked back to base on their own.

The final summary of logged flight time in the airlift totalled 1.5 million hours. The India-China ferrying operation was the largest and most extended strategic air bridge (in volume of cargo airlifted) in aviation history until it was surpassed in 1949 by the Berlin airlift, an operation also commanded by Gen. Tunner. Tunner, writing in &quot;Over the Hump&quot;, described the significance of the India-China Airlift:

From 1942 to 1944, 98 percent of all US lend-lease to China went directly to US Army units in China, not the Chinese military.

<doc id="904190" wikidata="Q571449" url="?curid=904190" title="Antarctic fur seal">
<text>The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) is one of eight seals in the genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;, and one of nine fur seals in the subfamily Arctocephalinae. Despite what its name suggests, the Antarctic fur seal is mostly distributed in Subantarctic islands and its scientific name is thought to have come from the German vessel SMS Gazelle, which was the first to collect specimens of this species from the Kerguelen Islands.

==Taxonomy==
Antarctic fur seals are member of the genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;. Recently, a proposal was made to reassign this species to the resurrected genus &quot;Arctophoca&quot;.

Antarctic fur seals may be confused with southern otariids that share their range, like Subantarctic (&quot;A. tropicalis&quot;), New Zealand (&quot;A. forsteri&quot;), and South American fur seals (&quot;A. australis&quot;), and the Juan Fernandez fur seal (&quot;A. phillippii&quot;), as well as the South American (&quot;Otaria flavescens&quot;) and New Zealand sea lions (&quot;Phocarctos hookeri&quot;). 
Genetic studies on population structure suggest that there are two genetically distinct regions: a western region including the islands of the Scotia Arc, Bouvet Island, and Marion Islands, and an eastern region, including Kerguelen and Macquarie Islands. Seals from the Crozet Islands and Heard Island are mixtures from both regions.

==Description==

The fur seal is a midsized pinniped with a relatively long neck and pointed muzzle compared with others in the family. The nose does not extend much past the mouth, the external ears are long, prominent, and naked at the tip. Adults have very long vibrissae, particularly males, up to 35 to 50 cm. The fore flippers are about one-third, and hind flippers slightly more than one-fourth of the total length. 

Adult males are dark brown in colour. Females and juveniles tend to be paler, almost grey with lighter undersides. Colour patterns are highly variable, and scientists reported that some hybridization between Subantarctic and Antarctic fur seals has occurred. Pups are dark brown at birth, almost black in color. However, a very small number of partially leucistic Antarctic fur seals have been found.

Males are substantially larger than females. Males grow up to 2 m (6.5 ft) long and with a mean weigh of 133 kg (293 lb). Females reach 1.4 m (4.6 ft) with a mean weight of 34 kg (74.9 lb). At birth, mean standard length is 67.4 cm (58–66) and mass is 5.9 kg (4.9–6.6) in males and 5.4 kg (4.8–5.9) in females.

Antarctic fur seals live up to 20 years with a maximum observed for female of 24.

==Distribution==
Antarctic fur seals are believed to be the most abundant species of fur seal. The largest congregation occurs on the island of South Georgia in the southern Atlantic Ocean, which holds approximately 95% of the global population. The current best estimate of the South Georgia population is between 4.5 and 6.2 million animals. Bouvet Island has the second largest population with 46,834 animals. However, there are regional differences in population trends: some colonies are increasing in size (e.g. Kerguelen Islands, McDonald Islands), some are stable (e.g. Macquarie Island, Heard islands), and some are showing a decrease (e.g. Bouvet Island).

Antarctic fur seals have a circumpolar distribution and breed from 61° S to the Antarctic Convergence. Breeding colonies are found at South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands and Bouvet Island in the Southern Atlantic Ocean; Marion Island, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen and Heard Island in the Southern Indian Ocean; and Macquarie Island in the Southern Pacific Ocean. During winter, Antarctic fur seals range widely from the Antarctic continent to the Falkland Islands, and southern Argentina reaching as far as the Mar del Plata and Gough Island.

==Behaviour==

Antarctic fur seals are one of the better-studied Southern Ocean predators. However, the vast majority of information has been collected during summer breeding months. The breeding system of the Antarctic Fur Seal is polygynous, and dominant breeding males mate with as many as 20 females during a successful season. Males establish breeding grounds in October to early November. Females generally reach the colonies in December and give birth to a single pup several days later. Gestation lasts between 8 and 9 months and it has been observed a high breeding synchrony across the species&#x27; range, concentrating 90% of pup births in a 10-day window. Pups are weaned at about four months old. Juveniles may then spend several years at sea before returning to begin their breeding cycles.

The ecology of Antarctic fur seals during the non-breeding winter is poorly understood. Adult and subadult males may form groups while moulting along the Antarctic Peninsula in late summer and early autumn. Adult females are gregarious but relatively asocial other than the strong bond they establish with their pups, although there are occasional aggressive encounters with nearby females or other pups and brief interactions with adult males to mate. These seals appear to be solitary when foraging and migrating.

The usual food source for individuals in the Atlantic Region is Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;); while in the Indian Ocean the diet is mostly based on fish and squid. The fish prey are principally myctophids, icefish, and Notothenids, although skates and rays are also consumed. Penguins are occasionally taken by Antarctic fur seal males. Seasonal differences in diet have been recorded across colonies, seasons and years. Studies have showed that female Antarctic fur seals can undertake wide-ranging foraging migrations during winter. Interannual differences appear to be related to differences in local oceanographic conditions.

== Diet ==
Antarctic fur seals feed primarily on krill, fish, and squid. Birds are eaten occasionally outside the breeding season. Nursing mothers near South Georgia are dependent on krill during the breeding season, therefore the availability of krill is important to the reproductive success of this animal. The colonies at Macquarie Island and the Kerguelen Islands rely more on a diet of fish and squid. Antarctic fur seals dive at night to feed.

==Population status==
South Georgia islands, which hold approximately 95% of the global population, had a total population in 1999/2000 between 4.5 and 6.2 million. The South Georgia population reached carrying capacity fairly recently and may thus be spilling over into relatively nearby, lower density sites. However, the abundance of adult females is estimated to have declined by some 30% between 2003 and 2012, and by 24% since 1984 to around 550,000. The population trend according to the IUCN Red list is &#x27;decreasing&#x27; and it has been suggested that this decline is due to the effects of global climate change on prey availability.

==Threats==
Historically the species were decimated by the sealing industry for its fur and its population was driven close to extinction by the 19th century. Since sealing operations ceased in the early 20th century, the species has recovered at different rates across its former geographic range.

Waters inhabited by Antarctic fur seals are exploited by few fisheries, but these may expand in their range in the future. A 1997 study at South Georgia indicated that several thousand Antarctic fur seals were entangled in man-made debris such as discarded fishing line, nets, packing bands and anything that can form a collar. Consequently, CCAMLR campaigned for compliance with MARPOL provisions relating to waste disposal at sea, and for cutting of any material jettisoned which could form collars to entangle seals. Subsequent monitoring of entangled fur seals confirmed that entanglement is still a persistent problem, but it has halved in recent years. Trawling activities developing around Macquarie Island may affect the prey base of the primarily fish-eating Antarctic fur seals that breed on those islands. Recent work indicates that there is significant overlap between foraging areas and fisheries activities, suggesting a potential for competition for prey resources may exist.

Leopard seals have been noted to take as many as a third of the Antarctic Fur Seal pups born at sites in the South Shetland Islands. Levels of predation may be high enough to cause a population decline at these sites.

As well as the effects of hunting and fishing, the numbers of humans visiting the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic each year for tourism and scientific expeditions have risen. This increase in visits has led to greater interaction between the local fauna and humans. With this greater interaction comes the risk of affecting the territoriality of seals especially during the mating season. This can also increase the possibility of &#x27;exotic&#x27; injuries to humans. In 2015 a man was rescued from a South Georgia Island by British Forces after receiving a serious bite from a fur seal. Due to the remote location of where these injuries occur, this can lead to complications in getting people to a physician with the relevant experience in treating exotic animal bites. This issue is compounded by the complexity of fur seal behavior and how serious a bite can be and the risk of transfer of diseases.
The implication for Antarctic Fur Seals but this species is considered to be one of several pinnipeds at high risk of future disease outbreaks because of their tendency to congregate in large dense aggregations and the effect of environmental changes associated with global warming on the spread of diseases.

Finally, the 19th century population bottleneck led to reduced genetic diversity, leaving it again more vulnerable to disease and stresses of climate change. In particular, the Antarctic fur seal&#x27;s primary prey base, krill, could be reduced as a result of ocean acidification, or the distribution could be altered by climate change.

==Conservation status==
IUCN Conservation status: Least Concern.

The species is protected by the governments in whose waters it resides (Australia, South Africa, France) and by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals in waters south of 60° S. The animal is also listed in Appendix 2 of CITES.

<text>Royal Air Force West Raynham, or more simply RAF West Raynham, is a former Royal Air Force station located west of West Raynham, Norfolk and southwest of Fakenham, Norfolk, England.

The airfield opened during May 1939 and was used by RAF Bomber Command during the Second World War with the loss of 86 aircraft.

The station closed in 1994, though the Ministry of Defence (MoD) retained it as a strategic reserve. Having lain derelict since closure, the station was deemed surplus to requirements by the MoD in 2004 and two years later was sold to the Welbeck Estate Group who resold the entire site in October 2007. It is now managed by FW Properties of Norwich, acting for administrators Moore Stephens.
The technical area now operates as a business park with many buildings now reused. The former married quarter areas are now all occupied with a pub and nursery on site.

Planning permission was granted for the installation of a 49.9 MW solar farm, together with plant housing and a perimeter fence, operated by Good Energy. The solar farm is now fully operational.

==History==

===Second World War===

Built between 1938 and 1939, RAF West Raynham was an expansion scheme airfield. The grass landing area was aligned roughly north-east to south-west. The main camp, with housing and headquarters, was located immediately west of the landing area. To the south-east were bomb stores. The airfield was originally equipped with a Watch Office with Tower (Fort Type), of pattern 207/36 (made from concrete), although the original control room was later removed and new larger control room built to pattern 4698/43. The newer VHB type control tower was a post war addition.

101 Squadron – a detachment of Bristol Blenheim which was part of 2 Group – were moved to West Raynham in May 1939. The only squadron based at RAF West Raynham, 101 Squadron were held in reserve by 2 Group until they were used as target tugs in February 1940. In 1940, RAF West Raynham also acted as a temporary base for 18 and 139 squadrons after they suffered losses in the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;.

RAF Great Massingham was founded in 1940, just from RAF West Raynham to act as a satellite base. It was originally intended to support West Raynham and provide it with extra space for its Blenheims, but eventually expanded to accommodate a squadron of its own. A second support airfield, RAF Sculthorpe, was built to the north.

On 4 July 1940, 101 Squadron saw action for the first time. Individual aircraft attacked oil tanks in German ports. This went on for over a year, and during this time the squadron lost 15 Blenheims across 610 missions. No. 101 Squadron was transferred to 3 Group and consequently left West Raynham. They were replaced at West Raynham by 114 Squadron, another detachment of Blenheims. They were stationed at West Rayham for over a year before they were despatched to North Africa as part of &quot;Operation Torch&quot;. The squadron converted to Blenheim Mk Vs in August 1942, in preparation for combat in Africa. No. 18 Squadron also went to RAF West Raynham to be refitted with Mk Vs. At this time, squadrons 180 and 342 were formed at West Raynham. 180 Squadron was equipped with North American B-25 Mitchells and based at RAF Great Massingham which was associated with RAF West Raynham. 342 Squadron was provided with Douglas Bostons crewed by Frenchmen in early 1943, and was later relocated to RAF Sculthorpe.

Between May and November 1943, the grass landing area was replaced with two concrete runways, one 04-22 and long and the other 10–28 . At the same time, the existing housing on the site was expanded to provide accommodation for 2,456 men and 658 women.

In December 1943, the station was taken over by 100 Group, who brought 141 and 239 squadrons to RAF West Raynham. They were equipped with de Havilland Mosquito, fighter aircraft which provided support to bomber sorties in enemy air space. They were based at West Raynham until the end of the war; their duties involved flying Serrate patrols and &quot;Ranger sorties&quot; (seek and destroy enemy fighters in the air and on the ground). During the war, squadrons stationed at RAF West Raynham lost 56 Blenheims, 29 Mosquitos, and a Bristol Beaufighter.
===Postwar===
From 1945 to 1962, RAF West Raynham was Central Fighter Establishment of the Royal Air Force. In 1946, the station underwent improvements, including new range facilities at Setchey, North Wooton and Holbeach, extra Officers accommodation, new technical facilities, a new cinema at Great Massingham and finally, provision of a new Flying Control and Crash Rescue Building for Very Heavy Bomber Stations to a drawing number 294/45. This was opened on 20 May 1948 following problems with the VCR glazing.

The station still had at least two operational Gloster Meteor jet fighters, a squadron of twin tail-boomed de Havilland Venoms and de Havilland Vampire trainer jets. The very latest arrival in 1957 was a flight of Gloster Javelins, which also appeared at the Farnborough Airshow the same year.

The 1956 Hawker Hunter multiple aircraft accident happened on the morning of Wednesday 8 February 1956. Eight Hawker Hunter aircraft from the Central Fighter Establishment took off on an exercise. The weather closed in, causing them to be diverted to RAF Marham. Two aircraft landed safely, a third ran off the runway, and the fourth crashed into a field killing the pilot. The remaining four pilots ejected, with the aircraft crashing in open country. This incident was raised in the House of Commons.

In 1964 a tripartite squadron, comprising members of the British, American and German armed forces, was formed at West Raynham to evaluate the Hawker P.1127 Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) strike fighter aircraft.

In 1964, the East side of the airfield was developed as a SAM site, equipped with the Bristol Bloodhound Mk2 and its associated radars. The resident unit was No. 41 Squadron RAF. Some of the radars, launch control units, and launchers were air portable for deployment elsewhere if required.

Between 28 and 31 March 1967 Hawker Hunters from West Raynham were involved in Operation Mop Up. This operation saw repeated attacks by Hunters from Raynham and RAF Chivenor, along with aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, dropping aviation fuel and napalm on an oil slick being released from the wreck of the supertanker which had run aground on Seven Stones reef, near Lands End. On 9 June 1967 a Handley Page Hastings C2, registration WD491, was written off at Raynham when a tyre burst during landing.
In 1968 a Hunter from RAF West Raynham was used by Flight Lieutenant Alan Pollock, a flight commander in No. 1 Squadron RAF, to unofficially mark the 50th Anniversary of the Royal Air Force. This event is commonly referred to as the Hawker Hunter Tower Bridge incident.

On 19 December 1975, 85 Squadron, which had been stationed at the base flying the Gloster Javelin and Gloster Meteor in the early 1960s, made their headquarters at West Raynham after being reformed as a Bristol Bloodhound Mark II surface-to-air missile unit. 85 Squadron remained at West Raynham until it was disbanded on 10 July 1991, with the Standard bearing the squadrons battle honours placed in the safe keeping of Ely Cathedral.

In 1963, 1971, 1980, 1981 and 1982, RAF West Raynham was the location of the Royal Observer Corps annual summer training camps for eight weeks when up to 500 observers attended each week for technical training sessions. Other ranks were accommodated in spare barrack blocks and officers in the officers&#x27; mess. In 1980 the start of the camps coincided with a no notice station three-day Tactical Evaluation (TACEVAL) inspection by RAF Strike Command and much consternation was caused when a full-time ROC officer arrived at the main gate in a car loaded with radioactive sources needed for an ROC training session. With the arrival obviously not expected by the TACEVAL directing staff the vehicle was placed under armed guard and the ROC officer bundled into the station guardroom where he remained locked up for several hours until the senior ROC officer was located to vouch for him.

===Closure and redevelopment===

In 1994, RAF West Raynham was shut down by the Ministry of Defence. The airfield and technical site remained the property of the MoD but the site was disused and its houses left empty and falling into disrepair. In 2002 Norman Lamb, Member of Parliament for North Norfolk, labelled the situation a &quot;scandal&quot; as at the time there was a shortage of affordable housing in the region. Though empty, the MoD had retained RAF West Raynham as a strategic reserve, however in 2004 it was decided that the base would play no future role in the defence of the country. Lamb campaigned for the houses to be turned over for civilian use, and it was announced in October 2004 that 170 homes at RAF West Raynham would be sold. In December 2005 it was announced that the whole site would be sold by tender.

The site was purchased from Defence Estates by Roger Byron-Collins&#x27; company the Welbeck Estate Group on 7th April 2006, then resold it on 25th July 2008, as they had been unable to install the necessary infrastructure as was standard procedure with their previous MOD acquisitions including nearby RAF Sculthorpe. It was sold to Tamarix Investments; they planned to build new homes on the site and a hotel, as well as renovate the standing houses. The plans included turning the site into an eco-village, with a biomass generator to supply power. The 170 houses at RAF West Raynham will be repaired and 40 more homes added to the site. In 2008, planning permission was granted for the construction of 58 properties and for the conversion of the hangars into twenty loft style holiday apartments.

A Large part of the remaining hard standing and hangars 3 and 4 have been purchased by Norfolk Oak, previously from Anmer Hall.

Following the Grade II Listing of the post-war VHB Control Tower in June 2021, ten other structures on the former airfield were nationally designated as Grade II Listed buildings in March 2023. These were the original Watch Office (Building 72), all four C-type hangars, Station HQ/Operations Block, Parachute Store, Armoury &amp; blast walls and two Ready Use Pyrotechnic Stores (Buildings 64 &amp; 77). Historic England&#x27;s descriptions of these designated heritage assets refer to RAF West Raynham as one of the best preserved RAF expansion scheme bomber bases.

Gloster Meteor F.8, number WK654, is preserved at the City of Norwich Aviation Museum. This aircraft served with the ‘All Weather Flying Squadron’ and Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. Gloster Javelin FAW8 XH992 has been preserved in 85 Squadron markings at the Newark Air Museum. The Bloodhound missile that formerly served as gate guardian outside the station HQ is preserved at RAF Cosford.

On 13 May 2008 Air Commodore Clive Bairsto presented Wing Commander Seb Kendall of No 6 RAF Force Protection Wing HQ with its recently approved badge. This badge includes the sword from the badge of RAF West Raynham, the former home of 6 Wing RAF Regiment.

Funds were raised to erect a permanent memorial to all who served at RAF West Raynham between 1939 and 1994. It depicts the station badge and the badge of the Central Fighter Establishment (1944–1966) It was sited on an existing plinth which once held a Norfolk village type sign of the station badge. This plinth was donated by Investec, the site owners and repaired by FW Properties of Norwich, who manage the site.

It also has a representation of aircraft which flew from WR and associated squadrons. The aircraft represented are: the Bristol Blenheim, the first operational aircraft to fly from RAF West Raynham with No 101 Squadron; the Bristol Bloodhound and BAe Dynamics Rapier missiles to represent air defence roles; the English Electric Canberra, the last operational aircraft to fly from RAF West Raynham. Finally, the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel, later developed as the famous Harrier jump-jet, was evaluated at WR in 1965, with a Tri-partite Squadron consisting of military test pilots from Great Britain, the United States and West Germany. One of the Kestrels (XS695) can be viewed at the RAFM Cosford.

The aircraft which flew with the Central Fighter Establishment and RAF West Raynham are represented by the de Havilland Mosquito; the de Havilland Vampire; the Gloster Meteor; the Hawker Hunter and the Gloster Javelin. In addition, Fleet Air Arm Squadrons 746 and 787 served alongside CFE. Between them they flew over 35 types of aircraft.

The Memorial was unveiled by Air Vice Marshal Les Phipps, Wing Commander Don Webb DFM and Mr Kenny Freeman on 27 September 2014.

==Television and film==
Following closure RAF West Raynham was used as the location venue for the two part miniseries, &quot;Over Here&quot;. The series was filmed at the station in 1996, starring Martin Clunes and Samuel West.

In 2009, Channel 4 used the former base as a location for a documentary on the contribution of Polish fighter pilots in the Second World War. West Raynham stood in for both RAF Northolt and RAF Uxbridge, with Air Cadets from Watton being employed in the filming.

Between 9–15 January 2010, RAF West Raynham featured on the LivingTV series &quot;Most Haunted Live&quot; in a series called &quot;The Silent Town&quot;. Shooting took place at a variety of locations on the base, including Hangars 3 and 4, the control towers, Guard Room, Station Headquarters, Sergeant&#x27;s Mess, Officer&#x27;s Mess, hospital and chapel, employing a crew of 120 people at the closed base. North American Harvard trainer aircraft 1747, from Duxford, was displayed in the Hangar 4 studio set for the duration of the shoot, becoming the first aircraft to officially use the airfield since closure.

The 2023 short film The Shepherd starring John Travolta used the airfield as a setting.

<doc id="904196" wikidata="Q3656197" url="?curid=904196" title="Loren Coleman">
<text>Loren Coleman (born July 12, 1947) is an American cryptozoologist, author and television personality who has written over 40 books on a number of topics, including cryptozoology. He is also the President, Founder and leading Director of the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland, Maine. He has a background in social work and has also written on the topic of suicide, particularly the copycat effect.

==Early life==
Coleman was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and grew up in Decatur, Illinois. He was the oldest of four children. His father was a firefighter and his mother a homemaker. He graduated in 1965 from MacArthur High School. He studied anthropology and zoology at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in social work from Simmons University, doing postgraduate work on sociology and anthropology at the University of New Hampshire and Brandeis University. He moved to Maine in 1980.

==Cryptozoology==
Coleman writes on popular culture, animal mysteries, folklore, and cryptozoology. An editor of the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; said, &quot;among monster hunters, Loren&#x27;s one of the more reputable, but I&#x27;m not convinced that what cryptozoologists seek is actually out there.&quot; He has written articles and books on cryptozoology and other Fortean topics, and over 40 books on the subject.&quot;&quot; Coleman has carried out fieldwork throughout North America regarding sightings, trace evidence, and Native peoples&#x27; traditions of Sasquatch and other possible cryptids and appeared on NPR discussing the death of Grover Krant&quot;z&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Paraview Press introduced a series of books, &quot;Loren Coleman Presents&quot; in 2004. Coleman wrote introductions to volumes in the series. Coleman contributed to the exhibition &quot;Cryptozoology: Out of Time Place Scale,&quot; shown at Bates College Museum of Art (June 24 - October 8, 2006) and at the H &amp; R Block Artspace at the Kansas City Art Institute (October 28 - December 20, 2006). Coleman is also a contributor/coauthor of the 2006 Bates exhibition catalogue and book, &quot;Cryptozoology: Out of Time Place Scale&quot;. He also wrote the essay &quot;Cryptids&quot; for Alexis Rockman.

===International Cryptozoology Museum===

Coleman established a Cryptozoology Museum in 2003 in Portland, Maine. The first downtown location for the museum opened in November 2009, occupying the rear of The Green Hand Bookshop, a Portland general used bookshop specializing in science fiction, fantasy, and other forms of Gothic fiction. On October 30, 2011, two years after moving onto Congress Street, it re-opened in a much larger space around the corner at 11 Avon Street, although it was still located in the Trelawny Building. The museum then moved again in the summer of 2016, opening in July on Thompson&#x27;s Point, where it resides now.

Artwork by University of Southern Maine students, Coleman&#x27;s former workplace, were installed in 2019.

In 2022, Coleman announced plans to move the museum to Bangor, Maine, and in 2023 he purchased a building on Broadway for that purpose. The Streamline Moderne building is notable for being on the National Register of Historic Places. Initially, the plan was to move the museum to Bangor in 2024, but lack of funding has delayed that until mid- to late 2025.

===Criticism===

Justin Mullis criticized Coleman&#x27;s assumption about a 1955 incident in which an Indiana woman was pulled underwater by something she did not see. Coleman claimed it was caused by a half human, half fish creature called a &quot;merbeing&quot;. Mullis pointed to Coleman&#x27;s reference to &quot;The Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; as an example of &quot;how cryptozoologists think about science fiction and its relationship to the natural world&quot;.&quot;Coleman has clearly used a scene from the film to prematurely solve an unexplained event, ignoring more plausible explanations, such as the possibility that Mrs. Johnson was attacked by a large fish or turtle or caught her leg on a submerged log. He also ignores the fact that Johnson’s story appeared at the same time the Black Lagoon trilogy of films was being released in theaters.&quot;Science writer Sharon A. Hill disagrees with Coleman&#x27;s assertions that cryptozoology is &quot;scientific and skeptically minded&quot;. Hill criticized Coleman&#x27;s Cryptomundo website, saying that members &quot;show blatant disdain for scientists and investigators critical of their claims&quot;. In reviewing a book by Grover Krantz, &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; editor Robert Boston said of Coleman and Jerome Clark&#x27;s book &quot;Creatures of the Outer Edge&quot;, &quot;Clark and Coleman are every bit as gullible as Krantz, but at least they know how to spin a monster yarn so that the reader gets an occasional chill&quot;.

==Suicide prevention==
Coleman has a master&#x27;s degree in psychiatric social work and was a consultant for the Maine Youth Suicide Program for nearly a decade. He has lectured often on the impact of the media on suicide and murder. He has specialized in the Werther effect, a phenomenon resulting in many copycat suicides following the publication of a 1774 novel. He has been called on for statements in the aftermath of school shootings and how best to respond to the problem. A specific concern continues to be cases of murder-suicide among the young as well as the possibility of clusters (e.g., teen suicides, school shootings, workplace violence, and domestic terrorism) and the influence of media coverage, leading to his writing the books &quot;Suicide Clusters&quot; and &quot;The Copycat Effect&quot;.
== Personal life ==
He is married and has two children.

<text>Postmodern theatre is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the postmodern philosophy that originated in Europe in the middle of the twentieth century. Postmodern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most postmodern productions are centered on highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, postmodern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.

==Postmodern techniques==
A postmodern theatrical production might make use of some or all of the following techniques:

# The accepted norms of seeing and representing the world are challenged and disregarded, while experimental theatrical perceptions and representations are created.
# A pastiche of different textualities and media forms are used, including the simultaneous use of multiple art or media forms, and there is the &#x27;theft&#x27; of a heterogeneous group of artistic forms.
# The narrative needs not be complete but can be broken, paradoxical and imagistic. There is a movement away from linearity to multiplicity (to inter-related webs of stories), where acts and scenes give way to a series of peripatetic dramatic moments.
# Characters are fragmented, forming a collection of contrasting and parallel shards stemming from a central idea, theme or traditional character.
# Each new performance of a theatrical pieces is a new , a unique spectacle, with no intent on methodically repeating a play.
# The audience is integral to the shared meaning-making of the performance process and its members are included in the dialogue of the play.
# There is a rejection of the notions of &quot;High&quot; and &quot;Low&quot; art. The production exists only in the viewer&#x27;s mind as what the viewer interprets – nothing more and nothing less.
# The rehearsal process in a theatrical production is driven more by shared meaning-making and improvisation, rather than the scripted text.
# The play steps back from reality to create its own self-conscious atmosphere. This is sometimes referred to as metatheatre.

While these techniques are often found in postmodern productions they are never part of a centralised movement or style. Rather, they are tools for authentic introspection, questioning and representation of human experience.

<text>The genus Arctocephalus consists of the southern [[fur seals]]. &quot;Arctocephalus&quot; translates to &quot;bear head.&quot; 

==Taxonomy==

The number of species within the genus has been questioned, primarily based on limited molecular data. The issue is complicated because some of the species are able to produce fertile hybrids. A recent review recommended the retention of seven species, deprecating the New Zealand fur seals to a subspecies of the South American fur seal, while also questioning the status of the Guadalupe fur seal. Other recent studies have indicated the genus may be paraphyletic, and some taxonomic reshuffling was previously done to account for this; however, more recent studies support it being monophyletic, with the alleged paraphyly being a consequence of incomplete lineage sorting.

<doc id="904209" wikidata="Q629509" url="?curid=904209" title="Cultural pessimism">
<text>Cultural pessimism arises with the conviction that the culture of a nation, a civilization, or humanity itself is in a process of irreversible decline. It is a variety of pessimism formulated by a cultural critic.

==Traditional versions==

It has been significant presence in the general outlook of many historical cultures: things are &quot;going to the dogs&quot;, the Golden age is in the past, and the current generation is fit only for dumbing down and cultural careerism. Some significant formulations have gone beyond this, proposing a universally-applicable cyclic model of history—notably in the writings of Giambattista Vico.

==Nineteenth century==

The pessimistic element was available in Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy and Matthew Arnold&#x27;s cultural criticism. The tide of Whiggish optimism (exemplified by Macaulay) receded somewhat in the middle of the reign of Queen Victoria.

Classical culture, based on traditional classical scholarship in Latin and Greek literature, had itself been under attack externally for two generations or more by 1900, and had produced, in Friedrich Nietzsche, a model pessimistic thinker.

==Early twentieth century==

Cultural pessimism of the Oswald Spengler epoch might be seen as a refusal of the rather intellectual and secular choice between nihilism and modernism. Politically this tended to squeeze liberal thought.

Specific criticism of the West, in the first years of the twentieth century, is usually taken as of the Old World of Europe, excluding therefore North America in particular. The classic source for this is Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (1918–1923), often cited in the years following its publication. The tone of much of the critical writing, for example, of T. S. Eliot, and the historical writing of Arnold J. Toynbee from the 1920s onwards, is identifiable. It was fashionable to say that Spengler had at least formulated some truths about the cultural situation of Europe after World War I. Eliot&#x27;s major early work &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922) was commonly and directly interpreted in those terms.

==Contemporary proponents==

Towards the end of the 20th century, cultural pessimism surfaced in a prominent way. The very title of Jacques Barzun&#x27;s &quot;From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present&quot; (2000) challenges the reader to be hopeful. On Matthew Arnold, a major cultural critic of the Victorian era, Barzun writes:

According to Arnold, the behaviour of the English social classes was touched neither by spiritual nor by intellectual forces; the upper orders were barbarians, the middle classes philistines. (op. cit. p.573)

The end of the millennium saw in the United States concerns rather specific to the conservative view on the culture wars and university education. Western Europe, on the other hand, struggled towards self-definition in the face of limiting demography, and postmodernism as at least journalistically predominant—the difference primarily lying in the political prominence of the issues.

<doc id="904210" wikidata="Q2279790" url="?curid=904210" title="Government of Ireland Act 1914">
<text>The Government of Ireland Act 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5. c. 90), also known as the Home Rule Act, and before enactment as the Third Home Rule Bill, was an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom intended to provide home rule (self-government within the United Kingdom) for Ireland. It was the third such bill introduced by a Liberal government during a 28-year period in response to agitation for Irish Home Rule.

The Act was the first law ever approved by the Parliament of the United Kingdom that provided for a devolved government in any part of the UK proper (as opposed to colonial territories). However, the implementation of both it and the equally controversial Welsh Church Act 1914 was formally postponed for a minimum of twelve months with the beginning of the First World War. The continuation of the war beyond 1915 and subsequent developments in Ireland resulted in further postponements, meaning that the Act never became effective; it was finally superseded by a fourth home rule bill, enacted as the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which partitioned Ireland, creating Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, both intended to have Home Rule.

==Background==
During 1909, a constitutional crisis began when the House of Lords rejected David Lloyd George&#x27;s Finance Bill. Two general elections occurred in January and December 1910, both of which left the Liberals and Conservatives equally matched, with John Redmond&#x27;s Irish Parliamentary Party having the balance of power in the House of Commons. The Irish Parliamentary Party, which had campaigned for home rule for Ireland since the 1870s, pledged to assist the Liberals in return for the introduction of a home rule bill. The Parliament Act 1911 then replaced the unlimited veto of the Lords with one lasting only 2 years, ensuring that a bill passed by the Commons could not be blocked for more than two years.

==The Bill==
The Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, introduced the Bill on 11 April 1912. Allowing more autonomy than its two predecessors, the bill provided that:
* A bicameral Irish Parliament would be established in Dublin (a 40-member Senate and a 164-member House of Commons) with powers to deal with most national affairs. Each of the four provinces of Ireland would be represented by ten senators elected by proportional representation.
* A reduced number of members of parliament representing Ireland would continue to attend the Parliament of the United Kingdom (42 MPs, rather than 103).
* The Dublin Castle administration would be eliminated, although with the retention of the Lord Lieutenant.

The financial situation was a concern. Irish taxes had yielded a surplus of £2 million in 1893, but by 1910 that had become a current spending net deficit of £1.5m, which had to be raised by London. An annual &quot;Transferred Sum&quot; mechanism was proposed, so that public spending in Ireland could be continued at the same level.

The Bill was passed by the Commons by a majority of 10 votes in 1912, but in January 1913 the House of Lords rejected it by 326 votes to 69. Later in 1913, it was reintroduced and again passed by the Commons and rejected by the Lords, this time by 302 votes to 64. In 1914, after the third reading, the Bill was passed by the Commons on 25 May 1914 by a majority of 77. Having been defeated a third time in the Lords, the Government used the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911 to override the Lords and send the bill for royal assent.

==Ulster crisis==

Unionists in Ulster were opposed to a home-rule Ireland governed from Dublin. Hostility to the Home Rule Bill was increasing in the counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, and Londonderry. Early in 1912, some of the residents of that area began forming small local militias. By April 1912, the Irish Unionist Alliance&#x27;s managing politician, Sir Edward Carson, could review 100,000 marching Ulster Volunteers. On 28 September 1912, more than 500,000 Unionists signed the Ulster Covenant pledging to defy Home Rule by all means possible. The Covenant was developed by Carson and organised by Sir James Craig. This Covenant specifically pledged not to acknowledge any Parliament out of Dublin, nor to obey its laws, nor pay any taxes levied by its government. This would be problematic especially since Ulster was the wealthiest and most prosperous part of Ireland.

In January 1913, the Unionist Council reorganised their volunteers into a paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), whose members threatened to resist by physical force the implementation of the Act and the authority of any restored Dublin Parliament by force of arms. On 28 November 1913, Irish Nationalists responded by forming the Irish Volunteers &quot;to secure the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland&quot;. The government&#x27;s willingness to effectively oppose the Unionist threat was rendered highly questionable by the Curragh Mutiny of 20 March 1914, when many British Army officers at Curragh in County Kildare, the main Army camp in Ireland, threatened to resign or accept dismissal rather than deploy against the Ulster Volunteers, forcing the government to cancel planned troop movements.

==Partition==
At the Bill&#x27;s third reading in the Commons on 21 May 1914 several members asked about a proposal to exclude the whole of Ulster for six years. Asquith was seeking any solution that would avoid a civil war. During the emotional debate which lasted until 25 May 1914, Sir Edward Carson made the statement: 
A government amending bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 23 June 1914 (before the Lords had considered the original Home Rule bill itself) and passed there with amendments on 8 July. Carson and the Irish Unionist Party (mostly Ulster MPs) backed the amending bill, which provided for &quot;temporary exclusion of Ulster&quot; from the workings of the future Act. The Lords&#x27; amendments to the amending bill were unacceptable to the government. What was still to be negotiated were the number of counties excluded (four, six or nine) and whether exclusion would be temporary or permanent. The compromise proposed by Asquith was straightforward. Six counties in northeast Ulster were to be excluded &quot;temporarily&quot; from the territory of the new Irish parliament and government, and continue to be governed as before from Westminster and Whitehall. The length of the exclusion remained an issue of some controversy. To save prolonged debate in parliament, George V called the Buckingham Palace Conference with two MPs each from the Liberal, Conservative, IPP and Irish Unionist parties. The conference, held between 21 and 24 July 1914, achieved very little.

==Passing of the Bill==

With the beginning of World War I on 4 August 1914, Asquith decided to abandon his Amending Bill, and instead rushed through a new bill, the Suspensory Act 1914, which was presented for royal assent simultaneously with both the Government of Ireland Act 1914 and the Welsh Church Act 1914. Although the two controversial Bills had now finally become statute on 18 September 1914, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed for the duration of the conflict and would not come into operation until the end of the war. (Eventually Home Rule was considered by the Irish Convention in 1917–18, and by the cabinet from September 1919; the Welsh Church Act was delayed until March 1920). The Ulster question was &#x27;solved&#x27; in the same way: through the promise of amending legislation which was left undefined.

Dublin was a battlefield for a week during the Easter Rising of 1916. This rebellion would have a major effect on the Home Rule passage and many Home Rulers would be troubled by this event. After the Rising, two attempts were made during the First World War to implement the Act. The first attempt came in June 1916, when Prime Minister H. H. Asquith sent David Lloyd George, then Minister for Munitions, to Dublin to offer immediate implementation to the leaders of the Irish Party, Redmond and Dillon. The scheme concerned partition, officially a temporary arrangement, as understood by Redmond. Lloyd George however gave the Ulster politician, Carson, a written guarantee that Ulster would not be forced into a self-governing Ireland. His tactic was to ensure that neither side would find out before a compromise was implemented. A modified Act of 1914 had been developed by the Cabinet on 17 June. The Act had two amendments enforced by Unionists on 19 July – permanent exclusion and a reduction of Ireland&#x27;s representation in the Commons. When informed by Lloyd George on 22 July 1916, Redmond accused the government of treachery. This was decisive in determining the future fortunes of the Home Rule movement. Lloyd George, now Prime Minister, made a second attempt to implement Home Rule in 1917, with the calling of the Irish Convention directed by Horace Plunkett. This consisted of Nationalist and Unionist representatives who, by April 1918, only succeeded in agreeing on a report with an &#x27;understanding&#x27; on recommendations for the establishment of self-government.

The end of the war, in November 1918, was followed by the December 1918 general election. In the Irish part of the election, the majority of seats were won by the republican separatist Sinn Féin. In January 1919, the Irish War of Independence broke out, so that the 1914 Act was never implemented. The future of Home Rule was determined by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It established Northern Ireland, with a functional government, and Southern Ireland, the governmental institutions of which never functioned completely. Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Southern Ireland became the Irish Free State.

<text>The Government of Ireland Bill 1893 (known generally as the Second Home Rule Bill) was the second attempt made by Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone, as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to enact a system of home rule for Ireland. Unlike the first attempt, which was defeated in the House of Commons, the second Bill was passed by the Commons but vetoed by the House of Lords.

==Background==
Gladstone had become personally committed to the granting of Irish home rule in 1885, a fact revealed (possibly accidentally) in what became known as the Hawarden Kite. Though his 1886 Home Rule Bill had caused him to lose power after members of his party left to form the Liberal Unionist Party, once re-appointed prime minister in August 1892 Gladstone committed himself to introducing a new Home Rule Bill for Ireland.

The Irish Parliamentary Party had divided in 1891 on the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell (who died later in 1891), with a majority leaving the Irish National League to form the Irish National Federation, remaining divided until 1900.

As with the first bill, the second bill was controversially drafted in secret by Gladstone, who excluded both Irish MPs and his own ministry from participating in the drafting. The decision led to a serious factual error in the Bill, a mistake over the calculation of how much Ireland should contribute to the British Imperial Exchequer. The error in the calculation was £360,000, a vast sum for the time. The error was discovered during the Committee Stage of the Bill&#x27;s passage through the Commons and forced a major revision of the financial proposals.

==Debate==
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir William Harcourt, was himself alienated from the Bill having been excluded by Gladstone from its preparation, while the Chief Secretary for Ireland was engaged on other matters, and Gladstone, in the words of a historian, &quot;increasingly disengaged&quot;. On 21 April, the Bill&#x27;s second reading was approved by a majority of 347 to 304.

By the third reading on 1 September, 26 of the Bill&#x27;s 37 clauses had still not been debated. A fist-fight developed on the opposition benches between Home Rule and Conservative MPs. The Bill, though passed by the Commons with a slimmer majority of 30, had lost much of its credibility. At that time all legislation could be negated by the Conservative Party–dominated House of Lords, and here it failed on a vote of 41 in favour and 419 against.

==Contents==
The bill proposed:

===Legislature===
A bicameral Irish parliament to control domestic affairs, made up of a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly.
* The Legislative Council would have 48 councillors, elected for eight-year terms in two cohorts at four-year intervals. The franchise would be based on a £20 property qualification, higher than the £10 qualification of the Assembly. The constituencies would be the three largest parliamentary boroughs (Dublin, Belfast, and Cork) and the 32 counties, except that County Cork was divided into East and West Ridings, and Counties Sligo and Leitrim were combined. Most constituencies would elect one member; the more populous, two or three.
* The Legislative Assembly would have 103 members, elected for a maximum of five years, with potential for earlier dissolution. The constituencies would be those previously used for Westminster, though the bill would reduce and redraw the Westminster constituencies. The initial franchise would be as for Westminster elections, but the parliament would have the right to alter this.
* Disagreement between the houses would be resolved after two years by majority vote of the members of the two houses voting together.

===Executive===

* An executive under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland would form the Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Ireland.
* The new executive would not be responsible to the Irish parliament and the bill did not provide for a prime minister. This did not in practice mean that the executive would not be answerable to the assembly, nor did it mean that there would be no prime minister. Contemporary British enactments for the dominions contained exactly the same provisions. However, in reality governments became answerable almost immediately, and, as in the case of Canada&#x27;s Constitution Act, 1867, a prime ministerial office evolved early on, even if not mentioned anywhere in law.

===Irish MPs in Westminster===
Whereas the First Home Rule Bill provided for no Irish MPs at Westminster, the 1893 Bill allowed for the eighty Irish MPs to sit in Westminster; this would have been a reduction from the 103 MPs who were then in the United Kingdom House of Commons.

==Passed by the Commons, defeated in the Lords==

The Bill&#x27;s second reading was passed by the House of Commons on 21 April 1893 by 347 votes to 304; the final (third) reading was passed on 1 September 1893 by 301 to 267. However, in the House of Lords the second reading was defeated on 8 September 1893 by 419 votes to 41. This was a major stumbling block for the Irish MPs because the House of Lords was controlled by the Conservative Party and there would be little chance of it getting passed by them.

Gladstone retired soon afterwards. Some historians now suggest that Gladstone was the author of his own defeats on home rule, with his secretive drafting alienating supporters, and enabling serious flaws to appear in the text of his bills.

<text>Sydkraft AB is a power company headquartered in Malmö, Sweden. It is a subsidiary of the international energy group Uniper for operations in Sweden. The company is engaged in the generation of thermal, nuclear, and hydro power. The history of Sydkraft reaches back to 1906; however, the current company was created as a result of the split of Uniper from another international energy group E.ON.

==History==
Sydkraft was founded in 1906 as Sydsvenska Kraftaktiebolaget with August Schmitz as CEO. Originally, the company was producer of hydroelectricity. In 1915, in cooperation with the Swedish and Danish electricity grids, Sydsvenska Kraftaktiebolaget participated in the construction of &quot;Öresundskabeln&quot;, the first electricity interconnection between Sweden and Denmark.

In the 1970s, the company moved into production of nuclear power. In 1971, the Oskarshamn Nuclear Power Plant was commissioned, with Sydsvenska Kraftaktiebolaget as major shareholder. In 1977, the company changed its changed name to Sydkraft.

The majority shareholding in Sydkraft AB was acquired in 2001 by E.ON in a deal valued at US$6.5 billion. In 2004, Sydkraft bought the Swedish energy company Graninge. On 16 September 2005, Sydkraft AB changed its corporate name to E.ON Sverige. In 2006, E.ON Sverige sold its broadband network to Tele2.

On 24 July 2008, Statkraft AS and E.ON AG signed a final agreement on asset swap, according to which E.ON acquired Statkraft&#x27;s 44.6% of shares in E.ON Sverige by exchange of assets worth of €4.5 billion. After split of Uniper from E.ON, E.ON Sverige&#x27;s thermal, nuclear and hydro power generation was given to Uniper while renewable energy (except hydro), services, distribution, and retail sale remained in E.ON Sverige.

<text>Juanjo Guarnido (born 1967) is a Spanish illustrator and the co-author of the comic book series &quot;Blacksad&quot;.

==Early life==
Guarnido was born in Granada, Spain. He studied painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Granada.

==Career==
Guarnido collaborated on several fanzines and produced work for Marvel Comics. Unfortunately, the small size of the Spanish market forced him to turn to other means of earning a living. In 1990, he left Granada and moved to Madrid, where he worked on a TV series for three years. There he met Juan Díaz Canales, with whom he discussed producing comics. In 1993, Guarnido applied for a job with the Walt Disney Studios in Montreuil, France and consequently moved to Paris. He was the lead animator for the character Sabor in the Disney film &quot;Tarzan&quot;, as well as the lead animator for Hades in &quot;Hercules&quot; and Helga in &quot;&quot;.

After Guarnido left Disney, he reconnected with Canales. After contacting several editors, Guarnido and Canales finally signed on with French publisher Dargaud, and in November 2000, &quot;Quelque part entre les ombres (Somewhere within the Shadows)&quot; was published. It was a success among critics and the public, and won the Prix de la Découverte at the Sierre International Comics Festival and the &quot;Avenir&quot; Prize at the Lys-lez-Lannoy Festival, respectively in Switzerland and France. In March 2003, the second album &quot;Arctic-Nation&quot; was released. It was once again a success, winning the Prize Awarded by the Audience and the Prize for Artwork at the 2004 Angoulême International Comics Festival. The third instalment of the &quot;Blacksad&quot; series, &quot;Âme Rouge (Red Soul)&quot;, was published in 2005. In 2006 it was awarded the Angoulême Prize for a Series.

In 2009 Guarnido teamed up with writer Alain Ayroles, who is known for two hugely successful BD series in France - Garulfo and De cap et de Crocs, to begin work on a &#x27;one shot&#x27; project that resulted in the release of &quot;Les Indes Fourbes&quot; (The treacherous Indies) by publishing house Delcourt some ten years later, in 2019. Billed as the second part of El Buscón (The Swindler) by Francisco de Quevedo, it is narrated by lovable rogue Don Pablos whose aim in life is to become a gentleman. Les Indes Fourbes starts with Don Pablos’ journey to the New World and the comedy of events that unfold.

<doc id="904245" wikidata="Q2145213" url="?curid=904245" title="Tennessee House of Representatives">
<text>The Tennessee House of Representatives is the lower house of the Tennessee General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Tennessee.

==Constitutional requirements==
According to the state constitution of 1870, this body is to consist of 99 members elected for two-year terms. In every even-numbered year, elections for state representative are conducted simultaneously with the elections for U.S. Representative and other offices; the primary election being held on the first Thursday in August. Seats which become vacant, such as through death, resignation, or expulsion, are filled either: by the county commission (or metropolitan county council) of the home county of the member vacating the seat if less than a year remains in the seat&#x27;s term; if more than a year remains in the term, a special election is held for the balance of the term.

==Districts==
Members are elected from single-member districts. The districts are traditionally numbered consecutively from east to west and north to south across the state; however, in recent redistricting this convention has not always been strictly adhered to, despite a constitutional provision requiring districts to be numbered consecutively.

Districts are required to be reapportioned every ten years following the federal census in order to be of substantially equal population. However, from 1902 until 1962, the General Assembly ignored this provision. It was estimated that by that point that some districts in the Memphis area had approximately ten times the population of some in rural areas. In 1962 this issue was taken to court. Despite U.S. courts having traditionally declined to rule on such issues, the U.S. Supreme Court opted to hear this case and ruled that the legislature had to comply with the state constitution, as its failure to do so was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (see &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;). Subsequent litigation has further refined the rules regarding this; in the late 1990s a majority-black district in rural West Tennessee was required to be created.

The 1960s redistricting was credited by some observers with creating the first Republican majority in the Tennessee House since Reconstruction in 1968; this situation lasted only until the next election in 1970. 1970 also marked the first election of a Republican governor in a half century and saw both houses of the legislature begin to assert themselves as a counterbalance to executive authority; prior to this time legislators had not had their own staffs or even their own offices and were largely at the mercy of what the governor&#x27;s staff chose to tell them and in many ways were often something of a &quot;rubber stamp.&quot;

==Speaker of the House==

The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the House. The Speaker is elected to a two-year term at the beginning of the 1st half of each session of the Tennessee General Assembly. Additionally, the Speaker is second in line for succession to the governorship, after the Speaker of the Senate, in the event of such need. The Speaker appoints members to all committees as well. Even though the Speaker does not have to make committee assignments proportional to the party composition, usually that discretion is used when determining such. Usually, consideration of the abilities, preferences, party representation, and seniority of the members are taken into account. The chairperson, vice chairperson, and secretary of each committee also are chosen by the Speaker and must be given the same considerations in their selection. The Speaker is a voting member of all standing committees of the House, as is the Speaker pro Tempore. The Speaker also serves as co-chairperson of the Joint Legislative Services Committee and must approve, in concurrence with the Speaker of the Senate, the directors of the offices of Legislative Information Services, Legal Services, Legislative Administration, and Legislative Budget Analysis. Additionally, the Speaker is in charge of all facilities, professional and clerical staff, and custodians and security personnel of the House.
The current speaker is Cameron Sexton, who represents Tennessee&#x27;s 25th district.

==Composition of the 114th General Assembly (2025–27)==
===Leadership of the 114th General Assembly===
===Members as of 2024===
==House committees==
Committees, subcommittees, and their leadership for the 112th General Assembly are as follows:

== Expulsion of members ==
The Tennessee House of Representatives requires a two-thirds majority of the total membership to expel another representative. Since the Civil War, ten representatives have been expelled. Six representatives were expelled in 1866 for attempting to prevent passage of the 14th Amendment, which granted citizenship to former slaves. In 1980, Republican representative Robert Fisher was expelled for bribery. Republican representative Jeremy Durham was expelled in 2016 for sexual misconduct. Representatives Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson were expelled in 2023 for violating decorum rules by leading a gun control protest on the House floor during a legislative session. Both Jones and Pearson were later reinstated. Representative Gloria Johnson also participated in the demonstration, but avoided expulsion by one vote.

==Education level among members==

Among Republicans, around 30% of all members hold no degree beyond high school completion, less than 20% hold a Master&#x27;s or other post baccalaureate degree, and less than 10% have a law degree. Among Democrats, of whom there are a substantially lower number, 15% hold no degree beyond high school, around 30% hold a Master&#x27;s or other post baccalaureate degree, and 25% have a law degree.

== Diversity among Representatives ==
November 2020 saw the election of first openly LGBT people ever to hold seats in Tennessee&#x27;s state house of representatives, Democrat Torrey Harris and Republican Eddie Mannis. Before November 3, 2020, Tennessee was one of just five states in the nation (others being Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana and Mississippi) to have never elected an out LGBT person to its state legislature. Eddie Mannis did not seek reelection after a single term, citing bullying by the Republican caucus.

Of its 99 members, twenty-one were women in 2020. Representatives Harold Love and Raumesh Akbari hold leadership roles in the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, in which eight Tennessee state lawmakers are members. Akbari is also a State Director with Women in Government, as is Brenda Gilmore.

<text>Johann Jakob von Tschudi (25 July 1818 – 8 October 1889) was a Swiss naturalist, explorer and diplomat.

==Biography==
Tschudi was born in Glarus to Johann Jakob Tschudi, a merchant, and Anna Maria Zwicky. He studied natural sciences and medicine at the universities of Neuchâtel, Leiden and Paris. In 1838 he travelled to Peru, where he remained for five years exploring and collecting plants in the Andes. He went to Vienna in 1843. In 1845 he described 18 new species of South American reptiles. Between 1857 and 1859 he visited Brazil and other countries in South America.

In 1860 he was appointed Swiss ambassador to Brazil, remaining so until 1868, and again spent time exploring the country and collecting plants for the museums of Neuchâtel, Glarus, and Freiburg. In 1868 he became minister to Vienna.

==Peru==
He wrote a textbook on Peru called &quot;Peruvian antiquities&quot; in which he recorded various aspects of Peruvian life and history. In his book he explained the various skull angles of Peruvians in the context of the Angle of Camper. Tschudi claimed that Camper&#x27;s facial angles were an &quot;important angle in anthropology&quot;, whose &quot;greater or less opening indicates the intellectual superiority of a race, and, up to a certain point, of individuals&quot;. He went on to explain that he had obtained for his personal collection the mummified foetus of a woman at seven months found in the cave of &quot;Huichay&quot; (&quot;two leagues from Tarma&quot;), and included two engravings of it, to prove that the shape of the cranium of the Huancas was not due to pressures placed upon the cranium after birth for cultural reasons.

==Legacy==
Tschudi is commemorated in the scientific names of a species of venomous South American coral snake, &quot;Micrurus tschudii&quot;. the montane guinea pig (&quot;Cavia tschudii&quot;), the Tschudi&#x27;s yellow-shouldered bat, the Tschudi&#x27;s yellow-shouldered bat. Birds named after Tschudi include the Tschudi&#x27;s tapaculo, Tschudi&#x27;s nightjar, and the Tschudi&#x27;s woodcreeper.

<text>Travan is an 8 mm magnetic tape cartridge design developed by the 3M company, used for the storage of data in computer backups and mass storage. Over time, subsequent versions of Travan cartridges and drives have been developed that provide greater data capacity, while retaining the standard 8 mm width and 750&#x27; length. Travan is standardized under the QIC body. HP Colorado, Iomega DittoMax and AIWA Bolt are proprietary versions of the Travan format.

The Travan format competed mainly against the DDS, AIT, and VXA formats.

==Generations==
===TR-1===
* Travan TR-1 cartridges offer a 400 MB native capacity with a 0.25 MB/s transfer rate using the QIC-80 media format.

===TR-2===
* TR-2 was designed by 3M, but they never marketed it.
* TR-2 cartridges were designed to have an 800 MB native capacity with a 0.25 MB/s transfer rate using the QIC-3010 media format.
* The spec called for 50 tracks across the tape, with a recording density of 22,125 flux transitions per inch (ftpi).

===TR-3===
* Travan TR-3 cartridges offer a 1.6 GB native capacity with a 0.5 MB/s transfer rate using the QIC-3020 media format.

===TR-4===

* Travan TR-4 cartridges offer a 4 GB native capacity using the QIC-3095 media format.
* Travan 8 GB cartridges offer a 4 GB native capacity with a 1.2 MB/s transfer rate.
* Travan NS8 cartridges offer a 4 GB native capacity with a 1.2 MB/s transfer rate.
* Imation HP Colorado 5 GB is a variation on the TR-4 standard. It offered 2.5 GB native capacity, 1 MB/s transfer rate.

===TR-5===

* Travan NS20 cartridges offer a 10 GB native capacity with a 2 MB/s transfer rate.
* Travan 20 GB cartridges offer a 10 GB native capacity with a 2 MB/s transfer rate.

===TR-7===
* Travan 40 GB cartridges offer a 20 GB native capacity with a 4 MB/s transfer rate.

==Technology==
Travan uses a linear track technology, with data written onto individual tracks over several successive passes. Fully reading or writing a tape to full capacity may require moving the tape from reel to reel many times. The tape is not attached to the hubs, but is wrapped and held by friction. The tape is prevented from coming off at the ends using small holes punched in the tape, which are detected by optical sensors in the tape drive using a 45-degree mirror inside and a window on the side the cartridge.

It also uses an indirect tension-band drive system, consisting of an elastic band that presses on the exterior of both reels, and also over an idler wheel on the edge of the case. A motor in the drive contacts the idler to move the tape. Because the reels wind and unwind at unequal speeds there is always some slippage occurring when the tape is in motion; frequent retensioning of the tape (achieved by winding the tape fully forwards and then backwards at high speed) is required to prevent this problem. Old tapes used many times tend to have a visibly marked stripe down the center of the tape where the band has pressed into the tape.

Unlike some competing technologies such as Digital Linear Tape (DLT) and Linear Tape-Open (LTO), Travan technology does not automatically verify data after writing. Data verification must be done separately by the computer operator, to verify data was written successfully. If a separate verify operation is not performed after each backup, it is possible for backups to be found to be corrupt and unusable when the tapes need to be used.

<text>Utility software is a program specifically designed to help manage and tune system or application software. It is used to support the computer infrastructure - in contrast to application software, which is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users. However, utilities often form part of the application . For example, a batch job may run user-written code to update a database and may then include a step that runs a utility to back up the database, or a job may run a utility to compress a disk before copying files.

Although a basic set of utility programs is usually distributed with an operating system (OS), and this first party utility software is often considered part of the operating system, users often install replacements or additional utilities. Those utilities may provide additional facilities to carry out tasks that are beyond the capabilities of the operating system.

Many utilities that might affect the entire computer system require the user to have elevated privileges, while others that operate only on the user&#x27;s data do not.

==System utilities==
*Anti-virus utilities scan for computer viruses and block or remove them.
*Clipboard managers expand the clipboard functionality of an operating system.
*Computer access control software grants or denies requests for access to system resources.
*Debuggers typically permit the examination and modification of data and program instructions in memory and on disk.
*Diagnostic programs determine and report the operational status of computer hardware and software. Memory testers are one example.
*Network utilities analyze the computer&#x27;s network connectivity, configure network settings, check data transfer or log events.
*Package managers are used to configure, install or keep up to date other software on a computer.
*Registry cleaners clean and optimize the Windows Registry by removing old registry keys that are no longer in use.
*System monitors monitor resources and performance in a computer system.
*System profilers provide detailed information about installed software and hardware.

==Storage device management utilities==
*Backup software makes copies of all information stored on a disk and restores either the entire disk (aka Disk cloning) in an event of disk failure or selected files that are accidentally deleted or corrupted. Undeletion utilities are sometimes more convenient.
*Disk checkers scan an operating hard drive and check for logical (filesystem) or physical errors.
*Disk compression utilities transparently compress/uncompress the contents of a disk, increasing the capacity of the disk.
*Disk defragmenters detect computer files whose contents are scattered across several locations on the hard disk and collect the fragments into one contiguous area.
*Disk formatters prepare a data storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state drive, floppy disk or USB flash drive for initial use. These are often used to permanently erase an entire device.
*Disk partition editors divide an individual drive into multiple logical drives, each with its own file system which can be mounted by the operating system and treated as an individual drive.
*Disk space analyzers provide a visualization of disk space usage by getting the size for each folder (including sub folders) and files in folder or drive. showing the distribution of the used space.
* Tape initializers write a label to a magnetic tape or other magnetic medium. Initializers for DECtape format the tape into blocks.

==File management utilities==
*Archivers output a stream or a single file when provided with a directory or a set of files. Archive &quot;suites&quot; may include compression and encryption capabilities. Some archive utilities have a separate un-archive utility for the reverse operation. One nearly universal type of archive file format is the zip file. 
*Cryptographic utilities encrypt and decrypt streams and files.
*Data compression utilities output a shorter stream or a smaller file when provided with a stream or file.
*Data conversion utilities transform data from a source file to some other format, such as from a text file to a PDF document.
*Data recovery utilities are used to rescue good data from corrupted files.
*Data synchronization utilities establish consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa. There are several branches of this type of utility:
**File synchronization utilities maintain consistency between two sources. They may be used to create redundancy or backup copies but are also used to help users carry their digital music, photos and video in their mobile devices.
**Revision control utilities can recreate a coherent structure where multiple users simultaneously modify the same file.
*Disk cleaners find files that are unnecessary to computer operation, or take up considerable amounts of space.
*File comparison utilities provide a standalone capability to detect differences between files.
*File managers provide a convenient method of performing routine data management, email recovery and management tasks, such as deleting, renaming, cataloging, uncataloging, moving, copying, merging, setting write protection status, setting file access permissions, generating and modifying folders and data sets.

==Miscellaneous utilities==
*Data generators (e.g. IEBDG) create a file of test data according to specified patterns.
*Hex (or octal) editors directly modify the text or data of a file without regard to file format. These files can be data or programs.
*HTML checkers validate HTML code and check links.
*Installation or setup utilities are used to initialize or configure programs, usually applications programs, for use in a specific computer environment. There are also Uninstallers.
*Patching utilities perform alterations of files, especially object programs when program source is unavailable.
*Screensavers prevent phosphor burn-in on CRT and plasma computer monitors.
*Sort/Merge programs arrange records (lines) of a file into a specified sequence.
*Standalone macro recorders permit use of keyboard macros in programs that do not natively support such a feature.

<text>Tom Loftin Johnson (July 18, 1854 – April 10, 1911) was an American industrialist, Georgist politician, and important figure of the Progressive Era and a pioneer in urban political and social reform. He was a U.S. Representative from 1891 to 1895 and Mayor of Cleveland for four terms from 1901 to 1909. 

In 1993, a panel of scholars ranked him second among the ten best mayors in American history.

==Early life and business career==
Tom Johnson was born in Georgetown, Kentucky on July 18, 1854. Johnson&#x27;s father, a wealthy cotton planter with lands in Kentucky and Arkansas, served in the Confederate Army in the Civil War. The war ruined the family financially, and they were forced to move to several locations in the South in search of work. By age 11, Johnson was selling newspapers on the railroads in Staunton, Virginia, and providing a substantial part of the family&#x27;s support. He worked all through his youth, and never had more than one complete year of formal education.

Johnson&#x27;s break came through an old family connection with the industrial du Pont dynasty. In 1869, the brothers A.V. and Bidermann du Pont gave him a clerk&#x27;s job on the street railway business they had acquired in Louisville. Johnson rose rapidly in the business, and discovered a taste for the mechanical side of it. He patented several inventions, including an improved type of streetcar rail, and the glass-sided farebox still used on many buses today.

By 1876, thanks partly to royalties from his farebox, Johnson was able to strike out on his own, purchasing a controlling share in the street railways of Indianapolis. In the 1880s and 90s he expanded his interests to lines in Cleveland, St. Louis, Brooklyn and Detroit, and also entered the steel business, building mills in Lorain, Ohio, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to provide rails for streetcar tracks. He moved to Cleveland in 1883 and soon afterwards bought a mansion on the &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; of Euclid Avenue.

==Politics and philosophy==
Johnson was one of the most well known, vocal, and dedicated admirers of Henry George&#x27;s views on political economy and anti-monopoly reform. 

Two chance events helped spark Johnson&#x27;s interest in politics and social questions, and convert him from a conventional business tycoon to a radical reformer. The first was reading, on the suggestion of a train conductor, George&#x27;s &quot;Social Problems&quot;, in which the political philosopher expounded his belief that poverty and misery were a result of society&#x27;s newly created wealth becoming locked up in increasing land values, and advocating a Single Tax on land in place of wastefully taxing the productive activity of capital and labor.

Johnson then became consumed by the arguments George made in &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;; he read and reread it, finally requesting assistance from his business associates to find flaws in George&#x27;s reasoning. Johnson took the book to his lawyer and said, &quot;I must get out of the business, or prove that this book is wrong. Here, Russell, is a retainer of five hundred dollars [$13,000 in 2015]. I want you to read this book and give me your honest opinion on it, as you would on a legal question. Treat this retainer as you would a fee.&quot; Johnson then sought out George in New York at the first possible opportunity, and the two became close friends and political collaborators. Johnson abandoned his business of rail monopoly and spent much of his fortune promoting the ideas of Henry George.

The second event was being present to witness the terrible Johnstown Flood of 1889. Johnson and his business partner Arthur Moxham organized the immediate relief activities in the stricken, leaderless city. Interpreting the events through a Georgist lens, the experience left him with a deep resentment of what he called &#x27;Privilege&#x27;. The disaster had been caused by the improper maintenance of a dam holding a private recreational lake, owned by Henry Clay Frick and other Pittsburgh industrialists, who escaped all responsibility for it. More than that, to Johnson, the flood exemplified the inadequacy of charity and weak &quot;remedial measures&quot; to solve society&#x27;s problems.

== Congress ==
When Johnson went into politics, &quot;he went in on the explicit advice of Henry George.&quot; Johnson mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1888, and then won the seat in 1890, serving two terms. He promoted free trade and the Single Tax idea, and was a useful moderate on the divisive currency question.

== After Congress ==
The issue of privilege gradually made Johnson reconsider his own business career. &quot;Traction&quot; (streetcar) companies depended on route franchises granted by city councils; political connections and payoffs gave favored companies the upper hand. In an era when most everyone rode the cars, the stakes were high, and battles for franchises were often the hidden issue behind cities&#x27; factional strife.

Johnson knew the game intimately; in his speeches declaiming against the evils of the streetcar barons, he always pointed out that he could speak with authority, because he was one of them himself. In Cleveland, he came into conflict early with Mark Hanna, the powerful local businessman who by 1894 would be the leading power broker of the Republican Party, the man credited with putting fellow Ohioan William McKinley in the White House.

Johnson&#x27;s streetcar fights with Hanna and his allies make a colorful part of Cleveland political folklore. In a time when companies with a monopoly of transport on a route were able to charge five cents for a ride, he made the &#x27;three-cent fare&#x27; a cornerstone of his populist philosophy, and later he would come out in favor of complete public ownership. Through the 1890s Johnson gradually divested himself of most of his transit and steel holdings, to devote himself entirely to the politics of reform. 

=== Campaign for mayor ===
In 1901, pressed on by influential citizens and a public petition, he decided to run for mayor of Cleveland.

His campaign electrified the city. Johnson liked to rent large circus tents and set them up on neighborhood lots, attracting big crowds for whom he would deliver a powerful speech, banter cheerfully with hecklers, and finish with a stereopticon show with a political moral. On April 1, 1901, he was elected with 54% of the vote.

==Mayor of Cleveland==
Johnson&#x27;s entry into office would prove just as dramatic as his campaign. One of the campaign issues had been a valuable piece of city-owned downtown lakefront property, which outgoing mayor John H. Farley and the council had agreed to hand over to the railroads without compensation. Johnson obtained a court injunction to stop the giveaway, but it was set to expire three days after the election. Taking advantage of a legal technicality to get the new mayor sworn in early, Johnson&#x27;s men staged a surprise takeover of City Hall and saved the land for the city (today this land, with later landfill additions, holds Cleveland Browns Stadium, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center).

Johnson&#x27;s four terms in office transformed Cleveland. Securing a bipartisan reform majority in the city council allowed him to effect major changes in every department of city government. Some of his policies were true innovations, while others mirrored those of the two other notable Progressive Midwestern mayors of the era, Hazen S. Pingree of Detroit and Samuel &#x27;Golden Rule&#x27; Jones of Toledo.

In the judgement of one urban historian, &quot;Johnson was a superb municipal technician. He grasped not only the ethics but the mathematics of government.&quot; The new administration paved hundreds of miles of streets and expanded the city&#x27;s park system, building a large number of playgrounds, ball fields and other facilities. To popular acclaim, the mayor tore up all the &#x27;Keep off the Grass&#x27; signs in the city parks, a symbol of his belief in changing parklands&#x27; role from passive to active recreation.

Rubbish collection, then in private hands, had been a big campaign issue. Johnson eliminated the haulers&#x27; franchises and replace them with a municipal department; he hired back all the men who had lost their jobs, and demonstrated how a public service could provide better performance at lower cost. In keeping with the administration&#x27;s focus on public health, a street cleaning force was started, and the city&#x27;s Water Department was depoliticized and vastly improved. Public bathhouses were built in the poorest neighborhoods; some of these buildings survive today. Johnson also began work on the monumental West Side Market, one of Cleveland&#x27;s best-known landmarks.

To improve housing conditions, the administration established the country&#x27;s first comprehensive modern building code in 1904; the code became a model for many U.S. cities. As Director of Charities and Correction, Johnson appointed his own pastor, Harris R. Cooley. Under Cooley, the city purchased a huge tract of farmland in Warrensville Township, where a new City Workhouse was established on humanitarian principles, along with cottages for the indigent elderly and a sanatorium.

Johnson was fortunate in finding talented men to staff his administration. Police Chief Fred Kohler, a stubborn, incorruptible martinet, gained national renown for cleaning up and professionalizing the force, and clamping down on vice. While laws were strictly enforced, Kohler made sure his men went easy on young first offenders and honest citizens in trouble. City Solicitor Newton D. Baker led the successful fight for &#x27;Home Rule&#x27;, working to give Cleveland a charter that would allow it greater independence from state oversight; Baker&#x27;s efforts would pay off in 1912, when he wrote the amendment to the state constitution that brought full Home Rule to all Ohio&#x27;s cities. Both Baker and Kohler would become mayors in their own right, continuing Johnson&#x27;s policies, and Baker later served as Secretary of War under Woodrow Wilson.

The physical symbol of Johnson&#x27;s revolution in government is Cleveland&#x27;s civic center, a spacious park surrounded by public buildings, called simply &#x27;The Mall&#x27;. The origins of the &#x27;Group Plan&#x27; went back to a competition held by the Cleveland Architectural Club in 1895, but it was Johnson who pushed the appropriations through, and brought in a team headed by Daniel Burnham, the nation&#x27;s leading planner, to design it. In an idealistic age, civic centers like this were consciously meant to be an architectural expression of democratic ideals. Burnham, who had created the Court of Honor at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and designed the restoration of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., brought the City Beautiful movement of the era to Cleveland; work on the Mall and its ensemble of public buildings continued well into the 1930s.

Throughout the decade, the transit wars continued unabated. By 1903, the Hanna interests, the lines formerly run by Johnson, and others were consolidated into the Cleveland Electric Railway Company, a private near-monopoly opposed only by the Johnson-supported Municipal Traction Company, offering a three-cent fare. Seven years of conflict exhausted both firms and forced them into receivership. In 1910 voters approved a compromise plan called the &#x27;Tayler Grant&#x27; under which Cleveland Electric Railway would lease the lines from the city and be assured of a 6% return. Though the new arrangement worked well for decades, it was seen as a defeat for Johnson.

Johnson took up the cause of municipal ownership not only in streetcars, but electric power, to bring down rates by offering competition to the monopoly private utility. He founded the Municipal Light and Power Company, and though political opposition kept him from expanding it, the next Progressive mayor, Newton D. Baker, built a new plant that opened in 1914 as the biggest public utility in the U.S. &quot;Muny Light&quot; (now Cleveland Public Power) brought important savings on the city&#x27;s own electric bills, and those of residents fortunate enough to have access to the service, while it forced the private competitor to keep its own rates low.

In a booming city that for decades had been predominantly Republican, fiscally frugal and business-oriented, Johnson&#x27;s policies made him an extremely divisive figure. As his associate Frederic C. Howe put it, it was a &quot;Ten Years&#x27; War&quot;, and people were either strongly for the mayor or strongly against him. In winning his four terms, Johnson depended heavily on the vote from ethnic neighborhoods on the West Side, where his three-cent fare streetcars operated. In the middle and upper-class sections of the East Side, opponents railed against policies they called expensive and &quot;socialistic&quot;, pointing out that after only five years Johnson had nearly doubled the city&#x27;s debt.

The tenacious opposition of the Republicans and the business interests kept most of Johnson&#x27;s big plans tied up in legal battles. By 1909, Clevelanders were becoming increasingly weary of reform and endless political fights, and Johnson was defeated for re-election by a relatively obscure Republican, Herman C. Baehr. Having ruined his health and dissipated his considerable fortune in the cause of reform, Johnson lived just long enough to dictate his autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;.

== Death and burial ==
He died in Cleveland in 1911, and was buried next to Henry George in Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery.

==Legacy==

The revolution in government Johnson effected in Cleveland made him a national figure. The noted muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens called him &quot;the best Mayor of the best-governed city in the United States.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s vision of a more honest, efficient and humane city government inspired Cleveland politics for decades to come. The years that followed his death were perhaps the most creative period in the city&#x27;s history, in which it perfected excellent library and school systems, while completing the Group Plan&#x27;s public buildings on the Mall and the ensemble of educational and cultural institutions at University Circle. The city was frequently cited as a model in many fields of government efficiency and social reform.

Though Cleveland&#x27;s elites would never come around to sharing Johnson&#x27;s political ideas, his example did much to build a sense of civic duty and cooperative spirit among them. Typical of these was Frederick C. Goff, president of the city&#x27;s largest bank, who once said &quot;I am more concerned that the Cleveland Trust Company shall fulfill its obligations to the community than make money for the stockholders&quot;. Goff was instrumental in founding the Cleveland Foundation, America&#x27;s first community foundation.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Johnson ranked as the second-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. Only Fiorello La Guardia of New York City placed higher.

==Family==
Johnson&#x27;s brother Albert was also prominent in the streetcar business. In 1889, he became the financial backer and organizer of the Players&#x27; League, a baseball major league begun by the players themselves, in order to get a fair share of profits.

A cousin, Henry V. Johnson, was Mayor of Denver, and Henry&#x27;s son, the like-named Tom Loftin Johnson, was a noted artist.

<doc id="904260" wikidata="Q8000332" url="?curid=904260" title="Wilcox rebellions">
<text>The Wilcox rebellions were an armed rebellion in 1888, a revolt in 1889, and a counter-revolution in 1895, led by Robert William Wilcox against the promulgation of the Bayonet Constitution in 1888 and 1889, and against the overthrow of the monarchy in 1895. He was considered a royalist and dedicated to the monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Wilcox&#x27;s revolts were part of the Hawaiian Rebellions.

==Wilcox rebellion==
The plot was to overthrow King David Kalākaua of Hawaii and replace him with his sister in a coup d&#x27;état.

===Background===
In 1887, in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king, a group of government ministers led by Interior Minister Lorrin A. Thurston with the support of the Honolulu Rifles, forced King David Kalākaua to promulgate the Bayonet Constitution. The constitution stripped Asians of their voting rights while at the same time limited suffrage to wealthy Native Hawaiians, Americans and other Europeans. The king&#x27;s own powers were limited substantially. Hostilities grew over the new constitution that limited mostly non-white commoners&#x27; rights and power. Kalākaua&#x27;s sister, Princess Liliʻuokalani and wife, Queen Kapiʻolani returned from Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee immediately after news reached them in Great Britain.

===Plot and outcome===
In April 1887, Princess Liliʻuokalani attended the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria as part of Kalākaua&#x27;s delegation. Soon after the Jubilee celebrations, the delegation learned of the Bayonet Constitution that Kalākaua had been forced to sign under the threat of death. A planned tour of Europe was cancelled and the group returned to Hawaii. 

Liliʻuokalani felt that her brother, Kalākaua, was not competent to be king. In October 1887 and about the same time as Liliʻuokalani, Kalākaua&#x27;s distant cousin, a native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox returned to Hawaii. Wilcox had returned when the funding for his study program stopped after the new constitution was signed. Wilcox, Charles B. Wilson, Princess Liliʻuokalani, and Sam Nowlein plotted to overthrow King Kalākaua to replace him with his sister, Liliuokalani. They had 300 Hawaiian conspirators hidden in Iolani Barracks and an alliance with the Royal Guard, but the plot was accidentally discovered in January 1888, less than 48 hours before the revolt would have been initiated. No one was prosecuted but Wilcox was exiled. So on February 11, 1888, Wilcox left Hawaii for San Francisco, intending to return to Italy with his wife.

===A second plot===
Princess Liliʻuokalani was offered the throne several times by the Missionary Party who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on her brother, but she believed she would become a powerless figurehead like her brother and rejected the offers outright.

==Wilcox rebellion of 1889==
In 1887, in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king, a group of government ministers led by Interior Minister Lorrin A. Thurston with the support of an armed militia, forced King David Kalākaua to promulgate the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The constitution stripped Asians of their voting rights while at the same time limited suffrage to wealthy Native Hawaiians, Americans and other Europeans. The king&#x27;s own powers were limited substantially. A native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox, organized a rebellion on July 30, 1889, to revive the powers of the monarch over administration. The rebellion was thwarted by the absence of the King at ʻIolani Palace (who was needed to promulgate a new constitution), and the Honolulu Rifles. Wilcox was tried for treason, and acquitted despite his obvious guilt.

==Burlesque conspiracy==
The Burlesque Conspiracy is also known as an event called the Sandbag Incident. The name of the conspiracy, Burlesque, was mainly to mock Marshal of the Kingdom Charles Wilson for appearing to have been tricked into putting the Kingdom on a high state of alert for no reason.

===Background===
After the rise to power by Queen Liliʻuokalani, members of the National Liberal Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom became frustrated with her over a feeling of neglect to removing the Bayonet Constitution. Wilcox organized another plot in 1892 by forming a group called the Hawaiian Patriotic League which included John Edward Bush, Volney V. Ashford, and J. W. &quot;Bellowing&quot; Bipikane. The intentions of this group were to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic.

===Sandbag Incident===
Wilcox and Bush&#x27;s speeches drew the attention of Charles Wilson. He had agents infiltrate the group and inform him of the League&#x27;s activities. In March 1892, Wilson was informed of an imminent coup d&#x27;état. In response he put the Kingdom under high alert and sandbagged ʻIolani Palace (hence the name of the incident), effectively diverting the attempt. In response by the League to the Kingdom&#x27;s lockdown, they aborted the coup and no event occurred. To the public the heightened alertness appeared to have no basis, since no confrontation happened, making Wilson look like a paranoid fool (hence the name of the conspiracy).

===Aftermath===
Wilson raided the League on May 20 arresting and jailing more than a dozen conspirators including Wilcox for plotting to overthrow the government. Wilcox spent 36 days in jail and was not convicted, leading to his release. Ministers to the queen felt that the exposing of the conspiracy made it harmless. The conspiracy was received by Liliuokalani as one of many voices demanding the removal of the 1887 Constitution, subsequently she drafted the 1893 Constitution.

==1895 counter-revolution in Hawaii==
In 1895, Wilcox participated in another attempt, this time to overthrow the Republic of Hawaiʻi and to restore Liliʻuokalani to power. Royalist supporters landed a cargo of arms and ammunition from San Francisco, California in a secret Honolulu location. At the location on January 6, 1895, a company of royalists met to draft plans to capture the government buildings by surprise. A premature encounter with a squad of police alarmed Honolulu and the plans were abandoned as the royalists were quickly routed. Wilcox spent several days in hiding in the mountains before being captured. The son of one pro-annexationist was killed. Several other skirmishes occurred during the following week resulting in the capture of the leading conspirators and their followers. The government allegedly found arms and ammunition and some potentially evidential documents on the premises of Washington Place, Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s private residence implicating her in the plot.

==Wilcox&#x27;s continued resistance==
A few years later, after Wilcox&#x27;s final rebellion, he organized the Hawaiian Independent Party, later renamed the Home Rule Party, and won the majority of the seats in the Legislature. Wilcox was elected and served in Congress from November 6, 1900, to March 3, 1903, an advocate for Hawaiian rights and sovereignty, and against annexation. But tensions between Governor Sanford B. Dole (with veto power) and the Home Rule Party did not allow legislation to be passed. Wilcox died the same year he left office. Wilcox continues to be regarded as a hero by the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.

<doc id="904261" wikidata="Q6607072" url="?curid=904261" title="List of musician and band name etymologies">
<text>This is a list of band names, with their name origins explained and referenced with reliable sources.


* 2Cellos – The band consists of two members who both play the cello.
* 3 Doors Down – The band started out with drummer/vocalist Brad Arnold, bassist Todd Harrell and guitarist Matt Roberts. As they decided to tour outside of their hometown of Escatawpa, Mississippi and into Foley, Alabama, they came up with their official name as they saw a building with a sign with most of its letters fallen off, reading &quot;Doors Down&quot;. Since at the time they started out with 3 band members the name stuck and called themselves 3 Doors Down.
* 38 Special – The band&#x27;s name &quot;38 Special&quot; originates from a specific type of handgun ammunition called the &quot;.38 Special.&quot; The band members chose this name as a reference to this type of ammunition, which is commonly used in revolvers.
* 311 – 311 is an Omaha, Nebraska, police code for indecent exposure. One rainy day, 311 bassist P-Nut and some friends went skinny dipping in a public pool. They were apprehended by police. One of P-Nut&#x27;s friends, Jim Watson, was arrested, cuffed (naked), and taken home to his parents. He was issued a citation for a code 311. The band found the incident amusing, so they based their name on it.
* 10cc – By his own account, Jonathan King chose the name for the band after signing them to his record label UK Records, after having a dream in which he was standing in front of the Hammersmith Odeon in London where the boarding read &quot;10cc The Best Band in the World&quot;. A widely repeated claim, disputed by King, but confirmed in a 1988 interview by Lol Creme and also on the webpage of Graham Gouldman&#x27;s current line-up, is that the band name represented a volume of semen that was more than the average amount ejaculated by men (&quot;cc&quot; being an abbreviation of cubic centimetre), thus emphasising their potency or prowess.
* 50 Cent – The artist adopted the nickname &quot;50 Cent&quot; as a metaphor for change, after having served time at boot camp for selling drugs to an undercover police officer. The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as &quot;50 Cent&quot;; the artist chose it &quot;because it says everything I want it to say. I&#x27;m the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.&quot;
* 100 gecs – The name came from a spray-painted phrase seen by the duo in Chicago.
* 1349 – Named after the year the Bubonic plague reached Norway.
* The 1975 – Lead singer Matthew Healy said in an interview that he came up with the name after discovering an old art journal from a beatnik, with one of the dates listed as &quot;June 1st, the 1975&quot;. Healy said that he thought the placement of &quot;the&quot; in a recorded date was intriguing, and decided to use it as the name for the band.
* 1910 Fruitgum Company - The album liner notes explain Frank Jeckell found a bubblegum wrapper in a jacket found inside an attic which had the name on it. However, Frank has stated in interviews that this wasn&#x27;t true, and that when the band (originally &quot;Jeckell and the Hydes&quot;) signed with Super K Productions, they were given the name. He later happened to find a slot machine that had the text inscribed under one of the jackpot reels &quot;Copyright 1910 Bell-Fruit-Gum Mills Novelty Co., Chicago&quot; and believes the &quot;1910 Fruitgum Company&quot; name originated from it.

==A==
* a-ha – A title that member Pål Waaktaar contemplated giving to a song. Morten Harket was looking through Waaktaar&#x27;s notebook and came across the name &quot;a-ha&quot;. He liked it and said, &quot;That&#x27;s a great name. That&#x27;s what we should call ourselves.&quot; After checking dictionaries in several languages, they found out that &quot;a-ha&quot; was an international way of expressing recognition, with positive connotations. It was short, easy to say, and unusual.
* A-Teens – The &#x27;A&#x27; stands for ABBA since they started as a cover band for the group; their name was originally ABBA-Teens but was changed upon the request from Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to avoid confusion. The group later did other songs, such as &quot;Upside Down&quot;.
* ABBA – a palindromic acronym from the initials of the first names of the band members: Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. A producer of canned fish was already using the name Abba so the band asked permission from them to use the name ABBA.
* AC/DC – Malcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band&#x27;s name after their sister Margaret pointed out the &quot;AC/DC&quot; symbol on her electric sewing machine.
* Ace of Base – The band&#x27;s first studio was in the basement of a car repair shop, and they considered themselves to be the &quot;masters&quot; of the studio. &quot;Ace of Base&quot; was derived from &quot;masters of the basement&quot;.
* A Day to Remember – A former member&#x27;s ex-girlfriend used the term and the name stuck.
* Adiemus – Creator Karl Jenkins invented the word, unaware at the time that it means &quot;We will draw near&quot; in Latin.
* Aiden – After a character from the 2002 film &quot;The Ring&quot;.
* Air Supply – Five years before the band&#x27;s signing, Graham Russell saw the name in a dream.
* The Airborne Toxic Event – Named by leader Mikel Jollett after a section in Don DeLillo&#x27;s novel &quot;White Noise&quot; in which a poisonous gas cloud results from a chemical spill from a train car. Jollett saw a similarity between the life-altering perspective shift in the novel&#x27;s protagonist and the life-altering series of events that gave rise to the band, and the themes of mortality and media consumption resulting from the gas cloud in the novel are a source of inspiration for the band.
* AKB48 – After Tokyo&#x27;s area Akihabara (colloquially shortened to &quot;Akiba&quot;), a mecca for electronics shopping and geeks. The group was formed as theater-based, to perform at its own theater at Akihabara on a daily basis, so that fans could always go and see them live. It still performs there every day, although, after the group&#x27;s popularity went up, tickets started being distributed only via an online lottery.
* Alexisonfire – from contortionist stripper Alexis Fire, which nearly resulted in a lawsuit from the stripper&#x27;s representatives.
* Alice Cooper – Alice Cooper was a band before frontman Vincent Furnier started a solo career under the same name. Allegedly, Alice Cooper was the name of a spirit members of the band came in contact with through a ouija, though Furnier has also claimed that he wanted their name to contrast with their sound, and Alice Cooper sounds like somebody&#x27;s grandmother.
* Alice in Chains – The name was taken from lead singer Layne Staley&#x27;s previous group, the glam metal band Alice N&#x27; Chains. Staley shed some light on the subject in a Rolling Stone article in 1992: &quot;The name came from a side project of my old group [Alice N&#x27; Chains]. We were going to have this band that dressed up in drag and played heavy metal as a joke.&quot; Alice N&#x27; Chains&#x27; bassist Johnny Bacolas explained the name in the 2011 book &quot;Everybody Loves Our Town: A History of Grunge&quot;. Bacolas and Russ Klatt (the lead singer of Slaughter Haus 5), were at a party in North Seattle talking about backstage passes. One of the passes said &quot;Welcome to Wonderland&quot;, and they started talking about that being an Alice in Wonderland-type thing, until Klatt started saying, &quot;What about Alice in Chains? Put her in bondage and stuff like that.&quot; Bacolas thought the name &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; was cool and brought it up to his Sleze bandmates and everyone liked it, so they changed the name of the band. Since three of the members had very Christian mothers, they thought spelling it &quot;Alice N&#x27; Chains&quot; made it not sound a bondage name. After Staley left Alice N&#x27; Chains, he contacted his former bandmates and asked for permission to use the name with his new band with guitarist Jerry Cantrell.
* Alien Ant Farm – Bassist Terry Corso said the name was a day dream he had about how Earth is just an experiment for aliens from other planets.
* The All-American Rejects – The &quot;All-Americans&quot; and &quot;the Rejects&quot;, both suggested to the band as names, were merged.

* Alter Bridge – The band is named after a bridge near Mark Tremonti&#x27;s home on Alter road in Detroit.
* Alt-J–The spoken form of the band ∆, alt + j is the keyboard shortcut used to type ∆ on a Mac computer. ∆ is a mathematical symbol for change.
* AlunaGeorge – From the first names of the members, Aluna Francis and George Reid.
* Amon Amarth – Named after &quot;Mount Doom&quot;, in Tolkien&#x27;s Elvish speech.
* Anamanaguchi – The name came about from a member in one of Peter Berkman&#x27;s former bands pronouncing gibberish in the style of Jabba the Hutt; The band has also explained it as coming from the members&#x27; internships at Armani (Berkman and James DeVito), Prada (Ary Warnaar), and Gucci (Luke Silas) while studying fashion at Parsons School of Design.
* Anberlin – Band member Stephen Christian has offered the explanations that he planned naming his first daughter Anberlin and that the name was a modification of the phrase &quot;and Berlin&quot; from a list of cities Christian wanted to visit. The one story that Christian asserts is true, however, is that he heard the word in the background noise of the Radiohead song &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot;.
* ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead – Initially claimed to be a line in a Mayan ritual chant, though lead singer Conrad Keely has since admitted the story was a joke.
* Animals as Leaders – Inspired by the 1992 novel &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Daniel Quinn, guitarist Tosin Abasi coined the name as a reminder that &quot;we&#x27;re all essentially animals&quot;. Abasi went into further depth by saying, &quot;The name is kind of like, a lot of what we do is completely removed from the fact that we&#x27;re all essentially animals. We have a niche on the planet and we have a role in sustainable sort of ecology. But we&#x27;ve gone against our natural calling. The name is acknowledging that we do have more of a natural role on the planet. It&#x27;s also like, who would follow an animal to do anything? I think of the name as being both nonsensical and really literal.&quot;
* Apollo 440 – From the Greek god Apollo and the frequency of concert pitch–the A note at 440 Hz, often denoted as &quot;A440&quot;, and the Sequential Circuits sampler/sequencer, the Studio 440.

* Art of Noise – After the 1913 manifesto called &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; by Italian Futurist Luigi Russolo.
* Die Ärzte – Decided when the band noticed that the folder with the umlaut &quot;Ä&quot; was empty in most record stores. The band often stylises their name, which is grammatically correct German, with three dots in the umlaut in the letter &quot;Ä&quot;, as a parody of the heavy metal umlaut. No language using the Latin alphabet has a three-dot diacritic. 
* As I Lay Dying – After the 1930 novel &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; by William Faulkner.
* Ash – The band chose the first short word they liked in the dictionary, as stated in the CD booklet of &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7&quot;s&quot;.

* Auto-Icon – Derived from the term Auto-Iconization first attributed to Jeremy Bentham, Utility and Democracy: The Political Thought of Jeremy Bentham. Auto-Icon Started as a one-man project in Los Angeles in 1999 with the end of the century and Y2K looming, it seemed to founding member J. Hébert any one could call themselves an &quot;Icon&quot;.

* The Avalanches – Taken from the 1960s surf rock band of the same name.
* Avenged Sevenfold – Taken from the Book of Genesis, from the passage &quot;If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.&quot;
* Avicii – Stage name of Tim Bergling; he explained that the name Avicii means &quot;the lowest level of Buddhist hell&quot; (Avīci) and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace page.
* A Wilhelm Scream – The Wilhelm scream is a frequently-used film and television stock sound effect first used in 1951 for the film &quot;Distant Drums&quot;. The band were previously named &#x27;Koen&#x27; and then &#x27;Smackin Isaiah&#x27; before finally settling on the current appellation.
* Awolnation – The name is derived from leader Aaron Bruno&#x27;s high school nickname. In an interview with Kristin Houser of the LA Music Blog, he stated that he &quot;would leave without saying goodbye&quot; because it was just easier, so that&#x27;s where the name AWOL (slang from the military acronym for Absent Without Leave) came from.&quot;

==B==
* The B-52&#x27;s – From the name of a beehive hairstyle, itself named for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.
* Babymetal – According to Kobametal (the band&#x27;s producer), the name came to him by revelation (as a &quot;divine message&quot;). It is a play on the words &quot;heavy metal&quot;.
* Bachman–Turner Overdrive – A combination of band members&#x27; last names and the magazine &quot;Overdrive&quot;. The band&#x27;s name had previously been &quot;Bachman-Turner&quot;. All band members agreed that Bachman-Turner Overdrive sounded cooler.
* Backstreet Boys – After a flea market in Orlando, Florida.
* Bad Religion – Bad Religion&#x27;s Greg Graffin on their name:
You have to remember that we were fifteen-year-old punks–we wanted to piss people off. Anything that might make parents, teachers, and people with authority bristle was up for discussion. We also wanted a name that would suggest a great logo for stickers and T-shirts. Many of the names were compelling but too repulsive. Smegma, Vaginal Discharge, and Head Cheese might make for great logos but were quickly rejected as not representative of our songs. We played around with a lot of names involving the word &quot;bad&quot;–Bad Family Planning, Bad Politics. When we hot [sic] on Bad Religion, it seemed perfect. That year, 1980, was a time of rising prominence for televangelists like Jimmy Swaggart, Pat Robertson, and Jim Bakker. The year before, Jerry Falwell had founded the Moral Majority, which was having a powerful influence on the presidential election between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Religion was a hot topic, and those TV preachers seemed like a good target to us, though we didn&#x27;t think they could possibly last for more than a few years. We knew that most people were so defensive about their religious ideas that they would be highly offended by our name–a major plus! And then Brett came up with a logo that represented our philosophical stance. We felt complete.
* Badding – After the children&#x27;s literary character Paddington Bear.
* Badfinger – Originally called &quot;The Iveys&quot; after a street in Swansea, Wales. Once the band was signed to Apple Records by The Beatles the band took the opportunity to change their name. The name &quot;Badfinger&quot; was derived from &quot;Bad Finger Boogie&quot;, the working title of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;.
* The Band – They were originally known as The Hawks, after their original lead singer Ronnie Hawkins. While working with Bob Dylan in the 1960s, they decided to change their name, but were unable to agree on a new name. They finally decided to simply call themselves &quot;The Band&quot; after being derisively referred to as &quot;the band&quot; by critics of Dylan&#x27;s new electric direction on the 1966 tour.
* Bananarama – Partially named after the Roxy Music song Pyjamarama.
* Barenaked Ladies – Two members–Steven Page and Ed Robertson–were bored at a Bob Dylan concert and turned to amusing each other, pretending they were rock critics, inventing histories and comments about the Dylan band. They also made up various fictional band names, one of which was &quot;Barenaked Ladies&quot;. On another front, Robertson had agreed to perform with his cover band in a battle of the bands at Nathan Phillips Square for the Second Harvest food bank. The band broke up and he forgot about the gig. When he received a phone call a week before the show, asking him to confirm the gig, he improvised that the name of the band had changed to &quot;Barenaked Ladies&quot;, recalling the name from the Dylan concert. He then called Page and asked if he wanted to do the gig; Page reportedly could not believe Robertson had given that name. The two played the show on October 1, 1988, They arranged three rehearsals and missed them all. The two played the show on October 1, 1988, but instead of competing, they played while the other bands set up, playing every song they could think of that they both knew. The show went well and the pair continued performing and started writing songs together.
* Bastille – Lead singer Dan Smith was born on July 14, Bastille Day.
* Bat &amp; Ryyd – Originally named Batman &amp; Ryydman, but shortened to &quot;Bat &amp; Ryyd&quot; after a complaint from composer Kari Rydman.
* Bauhaus – Originally named &quot;Bauhaus 1919&quot; after the German Bauhaus art movement, and shortened to &quot;Bauhaus&quot; in 1979.
* Beastie Boys – Has the backronym &quot;Boys Entering Anarchistic States Towards Inner Excellence&quot;
* The Beatles – The Crickets were cited as an inspiration for the name. Additionally, the misspelling of &quot;beetles&quot; was a play on words, describing the &quot;beat&quot; of the band.
* The Beautiful South – The Beautiful South were an English alternative rock group formed at the end of the 1980s by two former members of Hull group The Housemartins, Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway. Heaton explained at the time that the name was partly a sarcastic reflection of his own dislike of southern England, and partly an attempt to force macho men to utter the word &#x27;beautiful&#x27;.
* Bee Gees – From &quot;B.G.&quot;, the initials of all three of band member Barry Gibb, radio DJ Bill Gates and speedway promoter and driver Bill Goode. The similarity to &quot;Brothers Gibb&quot; is just a coincidence.
* Belle &amp; Sebastian – From &quot;Belle et Sébastien&quot;, a children&#x27;s book by French writer Cécile Aubry.
* Between the Buried and Me – The band name was derived from a phrase in Counting Crows&#x27; song &quot;Ghost Train&quot;

* Disturbed – Originally known as &quot;Brawl&quot;, the band&#x27;s name was suggested by frontman David Draiman, in an interview he explained: &quot;It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time&quot;.

The albums &quot;More&quot; and &quot;Ummagumma&quot; (both 1969) credit the band as Pink Floyd, produced by The Pink Floyd, while &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; (1970) credits the band as The Pink Floyd, produced by Pink Floyd. David Gilmour is known to have referred to the group as &quot;The&quot; Pink Floyd as late as 1984.
* Pixies – Selected randomly from a dictionary by guitarist Joey Santiago. The band took a liking to the word&#x27;s definition, &quot;mischievous little elves&quot;. The name was shortened from the original &quot;Pixies In Panoply&quot;.
* +44 – Pronounced &quot;plus forty four&quot;, a reference to the international dialing code of the United Kingdom, where band members Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker first discussed the project.
* PMMP – From the names of the band members, Paula Vesala and Mira Luoti. The abbreviation originally meant &quot;Paulan ja Miran molemmat puolet&quot; (&quot;both sides of Paula and Mira&quot;) but the band has also explained it simply means &quot;Paula, Mira, Mira, Paula&quot; in a similar fashion as the Swedish band ABBA chose their name.
* The Pogues – Originally called Póg mo Thóin–Irish for &quot;Kiss my arse&quot;. Shortened to The Pogues after complaints received by the BBC.
* Poliça – According to singer Channy Leaneagh, Poliça is Polish for &quot;policy&quot;, and she sees it as a reference to an unwritten code that guides the members when they play together, as well as its work ethic. (Contrary to this explanation, the Polish word for &quot;policy&quot; is actually &quot;polityka&quot;.) In another interview, Leaneagh claimed that they wanted something unique, and she had a file on her computer which, following a corruption during a computer crash, had come back as &quot;Poliça&quot;.
* Popeda – an intentional misspelling of the name of the iconic Soviet car GAZ-M20 Pobeda.
* Pop Will Eat Itself The name came from a Wasted Youth album under which one EP was released (2,000 Light Ales from Home on Iguana Records) before eventually becoming Pop Will Eat Itself in 1986. The new name was taken from a quotation in an NME article on Jamie Wednesday by David Quantick.

* Portishead – After the English town of Portishead, Somerset, the hometown of one of the band&#x27;s founding members, Geoff Barrow.

* Procol Harum – From the pedigree name of a Siamese cat that belonged to a friend of Guy Stevens, the band&#x27;s manager. The name was Procul Harum, which is Latin for &quot;beyond these things&quot;, but was written down incorrectly by Keith Reid. The band would say in interviews that the cat was a Burmese Blue, though all cats with the name are the Devon Rex breed.
* The Prodigy – Bandleader Liam Howlett&#x27;s first synthesiser was a Moog Prodigy.
* Prophets of Rage – The band&#x27;s name derives from the title of the Public Enemy song &quot;Prophets of Rage&quot; from its 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.

==Q==
* Queen – Were originally called Smile. Singer Freddie Mercury came up with the new name for the band, later saying: &quot;Years ago I thought up the name &#x27;Queen&#x27; ... It&#x27;s just a name, but it&#x27;s very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid ... It&#x27;s a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of gay connotations, but that was just one face of it.&quot;
* Queens of the Stone Age – A name given by Chris Goss, who said the name implied they were &quot;heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls&quot;, while &#x27;Kings of the Stone Age&#x27; was described to be &quot;too macho&quot; and lopsided.
* Queensrÿche – Were originally called &quot;The Mob&quot;. The name is derived from a song on their EP &quot;Queen of the Reich&quot;, and is the only known use of the letter Y with an umlaut in English. It was used to soften &quot;Queensreich&quot; and not confuse the band with Nazism.
* Qntal – In a dream, vocalist Sigrid Hausen saw the letters in flames.

==R==
* Radiohead – Originally known as &quot;On a Friday&quot;, the band was given two weeks after signing to Parlophone to change their name.

* Rage Against the Machine – When the band formed in 1991, they chose the name of a song Zack de la Rocha had written for his old band, Inside Out.
* Rammstein – The band was named after the 1988 Ramstein air show disaster. At first, the band had denied this and said that their name was inspired by the giant doorstop type devices found on old gates, called Rammsteine. The extra &quot;m&quot; in the band&#x27;s name makes it translate literally as &quot;ramming stone&quot;.
* The Ramones – Paul McCartney used the alias Paul Ramone when booking hotel rooms. So the band decided to use the last name Ramone even though it&#x27;s not their surname.
* R.E.M. – Vocalist Michael Stipe drew the initialism randomly out of the dictionary. The term refers to the rapid eye movement phase of sleep. Stipe, however, says that is not the reason why the band is named R.E.M.
* Reel Big Fish – The band chose this name in favor of &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, a reference to the film of the same name, as well as &quot;Dull Boy Jack&quot;, a reference to The Shining. The final name was chosen almost arbitrarily, under the notion that it could be changed later. Bassist Matt Wong suggested &quot;Real Big Fish&quot;, and Aaron Barrett suggested changing the &quot;A&quot; to a second &quot;E&quot;. However, the name stuck, much to the chagrin of the band.
* Red Hot Chili Peppers The band&#x27;s name takes aspects of American blues and jazz band names, such as Louis Armstrong&#x27;s Hot Five, and blends them with other popular band names flaunting the words “Chili” or “Red Hot”.
* Relient K – Named after the car that guitarist Matt Hoopes drove in high school, a Plymouth Reliant K car. The spelling was intentionally altered to avoid a lawsuit.

* The Residents – In 1971 the group sent a reel-to-reel tape to Hal Halverstadt at Warner Brothers. Because the band had not included any name in the return address, the rejection slip was simply addressed to &quot;The Residents&quot;. The members of the group then decided that this would be the name they would use, first becoming Residents Unincorporated, then shortening it to the current name.
* REO Speedwagon – After Ransom E. Olds&#x27;s REO Speed Wagon, which band founder Neal Doughty studied in his transportation history class at the University of Illinois.

* Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her – After a song by XTC on their album &quot;The Big Express&quot;.

* Sepultura – Means &quot;Grave&quot; in Portuguese. The name was chosen after co-founder Max Cavalera translated the lyrics to the Motörhead song &quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot;.

* Shai Hulud – After the gigantic Sandworms of Arrakis from the 1984 science fiction film &quot;Dune&quot;, based on the Frank Herbert science fiction novel of the same name.
* Sigue Sigue Sputnik – The group&#x27;s name is a very rough translation of the Russian phrase &quot;burn, burn Sputnik&quot; or &quot;burn, burn, satellite&quot; and is claimed by the band to be an adaptation of the name of a Russian street gang. The name is also a nod to the band&#x27;s anti-conventional rock image; in a 1986 interview, band founder Tony James remembered reading that, after seeing Sputnik pass over the earth, Little Richard gave up rock and roll. James &quot;took that as a good omen&quot; for the band&#x27;s name choice.
* Sigur Rós – After the little sister of the band&#x27;s vocalist, Jón Þór Birgisson (Jónsi), whose name is Sigurrós (without a space). It translates to &quot;victory rose&quot;.

* Simple Minds – From a line in the David Bowie song &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;.
* Simply Red – The name came about when the manager of a local venue was confused about the band&#x27;s name and Mick Hucknall replied that it was &quot;Red, simply Red&quot;. The resulting misnomer was printed on publicity posters as &quot;Simply Red&quot;, and the name stuck.
* Skillet – Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project together. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique.

* Sloan – According to band member Jay Ferguson, the band&#x27;s name refers to a friend&#x27;s nickname. Their friend Jason Larsen was called &quot;slow one&quot; by his French-speaking boss, which with the French accent sounded more like &quot;Sloan&quot;. The original agreement was that they could name the band after their friend&#x27;s nickname as long as he was on the cover of their first album. As a result, it is Larsen who appears on the cover of Sloan&#x27;s &quot;Peppermint EP&quot;.
* Smashing Pumpkins – Frontman Billy Corgan had come up with this name as a joke years before the band had ever formed. Whenever people asked if he was in a band, he would tell them it was called Smashing Pumpkins for a laugh. The name stuck after the band formed, despite dissension from fellow band members.

* Squeeze – The group performed under several names, most frequently &quot;Captain Trundlow&#x27;s Sky Company&quot; or &quot;Skyco&quot;, before settling on the band name &quot;Squeeze&quot; as a facetious tribute to the Velvet Underground&#x27;s oft-derided 1973 album &quot;Squeeze&quot;.

* Stabbing Westward – Christopher Hall and Walter Flakus formed the band Stabbing Westward when they were in college. They came up with the name while working at the college radio station WIUS-FM. During an interview in 1996, Hall stated, &quot;Since we went to Western Illinois University, Stabbing Westward had a certain &#x27;kill everybody in the school&#x27; vibe to it! The school&#x27;s way out in farm country and the country is really close minded. I was walking around like Robert Smith with real big hair, big baggy black clothes, black fingernail polish and eye makeup. They just didn&#x27;t get it. We hated the town.&quot;

* Tangerine Dream – Edgar Froese, in an interview in Let It Rock magazine, claimed they named themselves &#x27;after the Beatles line in the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&#x27;.

* Thee Michelle Gun Elephant – A friend of the band mispronounced the name of The Damned&#x27;s album &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot;.
* Therapy? – The band chose the name because it was a simple word that everyone knows. The reason for the question mark at the end of the name was because when lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was writing out the spines for the cassettes to send off to the record companies, he began writing too far to the left, so to centre the writing and make it look more professional, he added a question mark to the end and it stuck with the band.
* They Might Be Giants – The name of a 1971 film, in which George C. Scott plays a man who believes he is Sherlock Holmes. The film&#x27;s title is in turn a reference to the literary character Don Quixote, who mistook windmills for giants. The name had previously been used by a ventriloquist friend of the band.
* Thirty Seconds to Mars – The name of the band came after a thesis of an ex-professor of Harvard.

* Trapt – According to the band&#x27;s lead vocalist Chris Taylor Brown: &quot;We were sixteen year olds in high school. We were young and rebellious and we felt trapped by society, so that’s what we came up with. We wanted to be strong and above the things that try to trap us&quot;.

* UBBA – An acronym of the Swedish phrase &quot;Utan B, Bara A&quot;, meaning &quot;without B, only A&quot;. The name is an intentional spoof of the famous Swedish band ABBA, but the resemblance to the Viking chief Ubba is just a coincidence.

Afterwards, the band had a long meeting and kicked around many more names, but nobody could come up with anything better.
* Wet Leg – In an interview with Diffus posted on YouTube in April 2022, the band stated that their name came from an Isle of Wight epithet to describe non-locals on the island; those who had crossed the Solent to reach the isle were said to have a wet leg from getting off the boat.
* The Whitlams – After the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam.
* The Who – Were originally called The Detours, then changed their name to The Who after a suggestion by guitarist Pete Townshend&#x27;s friend Richard Barnes. Their first manager, Pete Meaden, renamed them The High Numbers, and they released one unsuccessful single, &quot;Zoot Suit&quot;, under that name. When EMI dropped them, the band sacked Meaden and went back to being called The Who. Another possible reason was because of Townshend&#x27;s grandmother, who would always refer to popular bands as &quot;The Who?&quot;, due to her impaired hearing.

* Yes – Group members were searching for an appropriate name but needed a name to play their first gig under. They played their first gig on August 3 under the name Yes, suggested by Peter Banks as being short, positive, direct, and memorable. It was originally intended as a temporary solution until a permanent name could be found. Obviously, the name stuck.
* Yo La Tengo – The name is a reference to a story about the 1962 US Major League Baseball expansion team, the New York Mets. When two players chase the same batted fly ball, customarily one yells &quot;I&#x27;ve got it&quot; and the other then retreats to avoid a collision. But infielder Elio Chacón did not understand the English term, so he and outfielder Richie Ashburn collided a few times while chasing fly balls. Another teammate suggested that Ashburn yell the words in Spanish instead–&quot;yo la tengo&quot;–so Chacón would understand. After that Ashburn and Chacón no longer ran into each other. But another teammate, Frank Thomas, did not understand the Spanish term. So one day while chasing a fly ball, despite hearing Ashburn call out &quot;yo la tengo&quot;, Howard ran into Ashburn.

<text>STW is an Australian television station owned by the Nine Network that is based in Perth, Western Australia.
&quot;STW&quot; broadcasts from a shared facility transmitter mast located in Carmel. The station callsign, &quot;STW&quot;, is an acronym of Swan Television, Western Australia.

==History==

===Origins===
In February 1964, Swan Television was awarded a licence to operate Perth&#x27;s second commercial television station. The company&#x27;s shareholders at the time included Ansett Transport Industries, which was also preparing to launch ATV-0, the third commercial station in Melbourne, in October that year.

STW-9 began broadcasting at 5.30pm on Saturday 12 June 1965. Broadcasting from a purpose-built studio complex in the Perth suburb of Dianella, the station employed around a hundred staff.

The station was officially opened by the Premier of Western Australia, David Brand, following a documentary film entitled &quot;Montage of Perth&quot;. Its first night programming included the film &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, an MGM-produced tribute to Cecil B. DeMille called &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Showman&quot; and a replay of &quot;TV Spells Magic&quot;, a variety show produced for the opening of TEN-10 in Sydney the preceding April.

Upon launch, both STW and rival station TVW-7 launched a joint company entitled TV Facilities to allow the two commercial channels in Perth to share access to networked programs from the east coast.

===1970s and 1980s===
Among the station&#x27;s key achievements, it produced a major drama series in 1973 - &quot;The Drifter&quot;, starring Alan Cassell. In the run up to the launch of colour broadcasting, STW produced the first full colour TV news bulletin in November 1974. The station won its first Logie Award in 1971 for locally produced variety show &quot;Spotlight&quot;.

STW remained independently owned until 1978, when it became affiliated with the Nine Network, allowing direct access to its programming. In 1984, the station was bought by businessman Alan Bond for just under $50 million, becoming part of Bond Media. It became a network owned and operated station when Bond purchased the Nine Network from Kerry Packer.

In April 1984, STW9 became the first station in Perth to commence 24-hour broadcasting. The station also claimed the first hour-long news program in the city, beating TVW, and mirroring Ten&#x27;s in SA and eastern Australia (Ten did not have a station in the city until NEW-10 launched in 1988).

In 1989, Bond Media sold STW to Sunraysia Television for A$95 million. The deal also involved Bond Media purchasing the Sunraysia owned STV-8 for A$18 million. Bond Media was forced to sell due to the Federal cross-media ownership laws, which restricted the level of national reach for media owners.

===2000s===
STW commenced digital television transmission in January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 8 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 9.
In January 2007, Sunraysia Television posted a profit warning, from an expected 12% drop in revenue over the previous six months, citing a weak local advertising market and low ratings, despite a strong state economy. The profit warning led to speculation of a potential takeover of STW-9, with PBL and regional network WIN Television indicated as potential bidders. PBL Media announced in February 2007 that it would purchase STW-9 for A$136.4 million, with the deal to be completed in late March or early April subject to shareholder approval.
However, major long-term shareholder, WIN, was also interested in the station. In June 2007, shareholders approved a revised bid from WIN.

===2010s===
On 1 May 2012, STW launched Gold, a datacasting channel owned by WIN.

In 2013, Nine Entertainment Co. purchased the station from WIN. With control from 30 September, the station returned once again as an owned-and-operated station, although Nine Network now owned all five of its flagship metropolitan stations.

On 19 September 2016, STW began broadcasting from new studios located at 253–267 St Georges Terrace in Perth&#x27;s CBD, after 51 years at its original location in Dianella.

==Appealathon==

Appealathon was STW&#x27;s fundraising organisation. It can be considered a counterpart to TVW&#x27;s Telethon, and during the 1970s and 80s broadcast its own 24-hour telethon.

Since its founding in 1975, Channel Nine Perth&#x27;s Appealathon has raised in excess of $53.5 million for charity. Appealathon has supported four specific charities with Appealathon funds: the Activ Foundation, Civilian Maimed &amp; Limbless Association, Paraplegic/Quadriplegic Association and Rocky Bay. Many other organisations are helped as well on a yearly basis. Appealathon was involved in over 50 fundraising events and projects across Perth each year, including the City to Surf and the Rottnest Channel Swim.

In 2009, administration of the organisation was handed over to Variety WA.

<doc id="904267" wikidata="Q455594" url="?curid=904267" title="Necho I">
<text>Menkheperre Necho I (Egyptian: Nekau, Greek: Νεχώς Α&#x27; or Νεχώ Α&#x27;, Akkadian: Nikuu or Nikû) (? – near Memphis) was a ruler of the ancient Egyptian city of Sais. He was the first securely attested local Saite king of the 26th Dynasty of Egypt who reigned for 8 years (672–) according to Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;. Egypt was reunified by his son Psamtik I.

==Biography==
In Necho became ruler of Sais, assuming the pharaonic titulary, and a year later the Assyrians led by Esarhaddon invaded Egypt. Necho became one of Esarhaddon&#x27;s vassals, and the latter confirmed Necho&#x27;s office and his possessions, as well as giving him new territories, possibly including the city of Memphis.

In , King Taharqa of the 25th Dynasty was advancing from the south toward the Nile Delta principalities which were formally under Assyrian control; Esarhaddon prepared himself to return to Egypt to repel the invader, but died suddenly. Esarhaddon&#x27;s death led to a political crisis in the Neo-Assyrian Empire but at the end his son Ashurbanipal managed to become the new undisputed monarch. The counter-offensive planned by his father took place in 667–.

Taharqa was defeated and driven back to Thebes, but Ashurbanipal found that the fleeing king and some of the rulers of Lower Egypt – named &quot;Pekrur&quot; of &quot;Pishaptu&quot; (Per-Sopdu), &quot;Sharruludari&quot; of &quot;Ṣinu&quot; (maybe Pelusium) and &quot;Nikuu&quot; (Necho I) – were plotting against him. The Assyrian king captured the conspirators, killed part of the population of the cities they governed, and deported the prisoners to Nineveh.

Unexpectedly, Necho was pardoned by the Assyrian king, and was reinstated at Sais with his previous possessions as well as many new territories as a gift, while his son Psamtik (called &quot;Nabusezibanni&quot; in Akkadian) was made mayor of Athribis. It has been suggested that with his magnanimity Ashurbanipal hoped to rely on the loyalty of an Egyptian ally in the event of another offensive led by the 25th Dynasty pharaohs, and perhaps to inspire and strengthen a rivalry between the two families (i.e., Kushites and Saites) because of shared interests. According to historical records, Necho I was slain in near Memphis while defending his realms from a new Kushite offensive led by Taharqa&#x27;s successor Tantamani while Psamtik fled to Nineveh under Ashurbanipal&#x27;s aegis. This Nubian invasion into the Egyptian Delta was subsequently (664–) repelled by the Assyrians who proceeded to advance south into Upper Egypt and performed the infamous sack of Thebes.

With the Nile Delta secured once again, Psamtik I was appointed with his dead father&#x27;s offices and territories. Later, he ultimately was successful in reuniting Egypt under his sole control.

===Family===

Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt made claims regarding Necho I: studying a papyrus from Tebtunis, he stated that Necho I was the son of a king named Tefnakht, presumably Tefnakht II. Ryholt also put in discussion the existence of Nekauba who was the purported predecessor of Necho I and possibly his brother; Ryholt suggested that the few, dubious documents regarding Nekauba should be attributed to the later Necho II instead, and that Necho I was the direct successor of Tefnakht II.

French historian Christian Settipani believes that Necho married Istemabet, and they were the parents of Psamtik I.

According to British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, it is possible that princess Ta-khered-en-ta-ihet-[weret] was Necho&#x27;s daughter, given in a politically arranged marriage to the local ruler of Herakleopolis, Pediese.

A now-lost limestone lintel from Luxor depicted a chantress of Amun named Meresamun along with a Saite form of Osiris and the Divine Adoratrice of Amun Shepenupet II; Meresamun is called &quot;royal daughter of the lord of the Two lands, Nec[...]&quot;, the latter name written within a royal cartouche. It appears likely that Meresamun&#x27;s royal father was no other than Necho I who sent his daughter to the Precinct of Amun-Re in Karnak, thus marking the beginning of the Saite influence in the city of Thebes.

==Attestations==

Necho I is primarily known from Assyrian documents but a few Egyptian objects are known too. A glazed pottery statuette of Horus which contains his cartouches and a dedication to the goddess Neith of Sais is now exhibited at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology (UC 14869). The aforementioned, long–lost lintel of Meresamun was once photographed in an antiquities market at Luxor. A bronze kneeling statuette of a king Necho is housed at the Brooklyn Museum (acc.no. 71.11), but it is impossible to determine if it actually depicts Necho I or rather Necho II instead. He is also mentioned in several demotic stories.&lt;br&gt;
Necho I&#x27;s Year 2 is attested on a privately held donation stela that was first published by Olivier Perdu. The stela records a large land donation to the Osirian triad (Osiris, Isis, and Horus) of Per-Hebyt (modern Behbeit el-Hagar near Sebennytos) by the &quot;priest of Isis Mistress of Hebyt, Great Chief... son of Iuput, Akanosh.&quot;

<text>Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties - (red grapes.) The color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white, the red color coming from anthocyan pigments present in the skin of the grape. Much of the red wine production process involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin.

== Production ==
=== Grape processing ===
The first step in red wine production, after picking, involves physical processing of the grapes. Handpicked or machine-harvested grapes are usually tipped into a receival bin when they arrive at the winery and conveyed by a screw mechanism to the grape-processing equipment.

=== Destemming and crushing ===
On arrival at the winery, there is usually a mixture of individual berries, whole bunches (particularly with handpicked grapes), stems, and leaves. The presence of stems during fermentation can lead to a bitter taste in the wine, and the purpose of destemming is to separate grapes from the stems and leaves. Mechanical de-stemmers usually consist of a rotating cage perforated with grape-sized holes. Within this cage is a concentric axle with arms radiating towards the inner surface of the cage. Grapes pass through the holes in the cage, while stems and leaves are expelled through the open end of the cage.

After destemming, the grapes are commonly lightly crushed. Crushers usually consist of a pair of rollers, and the gap between them can usually be regulated to allow for light, hard, or no crushing, according to the winemaker&#x27;s preference.

The mixture of grapes, skins, juice, and seeds is now referred to as must. The must is then pumped to a vessel, often a tank made of stainless steel or concrete, or an oak vat, for fermentation.

In common with most modern winemaking equipment, de-stemmers and crushers are normally made of stainless steel (food-grade stainless steel for those parts that come into physical contact with the grapes).

=== Additions at reception ===
The preservative sulfur dioxide is commonly added when grapes arrive at the winery. The addition rate varies from zero, for perfectly healthy grapes, to up to 70 mg/litre, for grapes with a high percentage of rot. The purpose is to prevent oxidation and sometimes to delay the onset of fermentation.

Macerating enzymes (for instance glucanases) may also be added at this stage, to aid extraction of color and fruit flavours from the skins and to facilitate pressing.

Tannin may be added now, later in the winemaking process, or not at all. Tannin can be added to help stabilize colour, to prevent oxidation, and to help combat the effects of rot.

=== Cooling of the must ===
Some winemakers prefer to chill the must to around , to allow a period of pre-fermentation maceration (&quot;cold soaking&quot;), of between one and four days. The idea is that color and fruit flavours are extracted into the aqueous solution, without extraction of tannins which takes place in post-fermentation maceration when alcohol is present. This practice is by no means universal and is perhaps more common in New World winemaking countries.

=== Inoculation and fermentation ===
Once the must is in a fermentation vessel, yeast naturally present on the skins of the grapes, or in the environment, will sooner or later start the alcoholic fermentation, in which sugars present in the must are converted into alcohol with carbon dioxide and heat as by-products. Many winemakers, however, prefer to control the fermentation process more closely by adding specially selected yeasts usually of the species &quot;Saccharomyces ellipsoideous&quot;. Several hundred different strains of wine yeast are available commercially, and many winemakers believe that particular strains are more or less suitable for the vinification of different grape varieties and different styles of wine. It is also common to add yeast nutrient at this stage, often in the form of diammonium phosphate.

=== Pumping over ===
Soon after the must is placed in the fermentation vessel, a separation of solid and liquid phases occurs. Skins float to the surface, forming a cap. In order to encourage efficient extraction of colour and flavour components, it is important to maximize contact between the cap of skins and the liquid phase. This can be achieved by:
* pumping over (pumping liquid from the bottom of the tank and spraying it over the floating cap; normally this would be done several times per day during fermentation)
* punching down the cap (either manually or using an automated mechanical system)
* submerging the cap (the cap is kept beneath the surface of the liquid phase by a physical restraint)
* drain and return (the above techniques can all be supplemented by a drain and return operation, in which the liquid phase is drained off the skins into another vessel and then pumped back over the skins)

=== Temperature control ===
Fermentation produces heat and if left uncontrolled the temperature of the fermenting may exceed , which can impair flavour and even kill the yeast. The temperature is therefore often controlled using different refrigeration systems. Winemakers have different opinions about the ideal temperature for fermentation, but in general cooler temperatures () produce fruitier red wines for early drinking while higher temperatures () produce more tannic wines designed for long aging.

=== Following the fermentation ===
Winemakers will usually check the density and temperature of the fermenting must once or twice per day. The density is proportional to the sugar content and will be expected to fall each day as the sugar is converted into alcohol by fermentation.

=== Pressing ===

Pressing in winemaking is the process where juice is extracted from grapes. This can be done with the aid of a winepress, by hand, or even by the weight of the grape berries and clusters themselves. Historically, intact grape clusters were trodden by feet, but in most wineries today, the grapes are sent through a crusher/de-stemmer, which removes the individual grape berries from the stems and breaks the skins, releasing some juice, prior to being pressed. There are exceptions, such as the case of sparkling wine production in regions such as Champagne, where grapes are traditionally &quot;whole-cluster pressed&quot; with stems included to produce a lighter must that is low in phenolics.

In white wine production, pressing usually takes place immediately after crushing and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed, but pressing usually does not take place till after or near the end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins, and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the &quot;free-run juice&quot;, can be released by the crushing process and does not require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.

Winemakers often keep their free-run juice and pressed wine separate (and perhaps even further isolate the wine produced by different pressure levels/stages of pressing) during much of the winemaking process to either bottle separately or later blend portions of each to make a more complete, balanced wine. In practice the volume of many wines are made from 85 to 90% of free run juice and 10-15% pressed juice.

=== Types of presses ===
There are many different types of wine presses, but they can be broadly divided into continuous presses and tank presses.
Modern winemaking tends to favour tank presses with pneumatic membranes, which squeeze the grapes more gently than continuous presses. The press wine is often kept separate from the free-run, and kept for later blending or disposing.

=== Malolactic fermentation ===
A second microbiological transformation commonly takes place after the alcoholic fermentation of red wines. This is usually referred to as malolactic fermentation (MLF), in which malic acid, naturally present in grape juice, is converted into lactic acid under the influence of bacteria (it is not strictly a fermentation). MLF is almost universally practised for red wines. It often occurs naturally, owing to the presence of lactic acid bacteria in wineries, but there are also commercially available preparations of bacteria to inoculate for MLF if necessary.

=== Racking ===
Once the MLF is complete, the red wine is usually racked (decanted) off its lees (dead yeast cells and other solids), and has sulfur dioxide preservative added to avoid oxidation and bacterial spoilage.

=== Aging ===

Most red wine is aged for some period before bottling, though this can vary from a few days, in the case of Beaujolais Nouveau, to 18 months or more in the case of top Bordeaux reds. Aging can take place in stainless-steel or concrete tanks, or in small or large oak barrels. The latter impart some flavour to the wine as a function of their age and size (small, new barrels give more flavour than large, older barrels).

=== Fining and stabilization ===
Red wines sometimes undergo fining, which is designed to clarify the wine and sometimes to correct faults such as excess tannin. Fining agents include egg white and gelatin. Some red wines, particularly those designed for early drinking, are cold stabilized so as to prevent the precipitation of unsightly tartrate crystals in the bottle.

=== Filtration and bottling ===
Most wines are filtered at some stage before bottling, although some winemakers use the absence of filtration as a marketing tool. Filtration serves to make wine completely clear and to eliminate any remaining yeast cells and bacteria, which could render the bottled wine microbiologically unstable. Wine is normally put into glass bottles with cork stoppers, though aluminium screwcap closures and plastic stoppers are also common. Alternative containers such as Bag-in-Box, TetraPak and plastic bottles are also used.

== Consumption ==

Europe and North America are significant consumers of red wine, with variations in purchasing behaviors among countries. Americans prioritize grape variety when buying wine, while Spaniards focus on the AOC, and Swiss consumers seek the best price.

In the United Kingdom, red wine consumption volume increased by 35.71% between 2001 and 2005, making it the most consumed wine in the country, accounting for over half of total wine consumption. Red wine represents 52% of total wine consumption in Spain, 55.6% in Italy in 2004, and 70% in Switzerland.

In Canada, red wine dominates with a 52.3% share of total wine sales in 2004, although there are regional disparities, with Quebec favoring it even more. In the United States, there is a balance between white wine, preferred by women, and red wine, favored by men.

Red wine is gaining market share in many countries. Although white wine remains preferred in Australia, red wine consumption is experiencing significant growth. In Japan, red wine consumption now surpasses white wine, accounting for 48% of total wine consumed compared to 43% for white wine. While red wine&#x27;s market share may be increasing relative to other types of wine, overall wine consumption volume is declining in several countries. For example, wine consumption in Argentina has consistently decreased, reaching a -10% change from 2003 to 2004.

In 2013, China surpassed France and Italy to become the world&#x27;s largest consumer of red wine.

== Health effects ==
Since red wine contains alcohol, it can have detrimental effects on the liver and pancreas, worsen gout symptoms, and cause strokes when drunk excessively. It is also advisable to not drink red wine during pregnancy.

It has been proposed that resveratrol, a polyphenol in red wine, might help prevent heart problems and blood clots if the wine is consumed in small amounts. However, research is lacking and definitive conclusions can not be made with the current evidence.

<doc id="904270" wikidata="Q3697780" url="?curid=904270" title="Social commentary">
<text>Social commentary is the act of using rhetorical means to provide commentary on social, cultural, political, or economic issues in a society. This is often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people&#x27;s sense of justice. Social commentary can be practiced through all forms of communication, from printed form, to conversations to computerized communication.

Two examples of strong and bitter social commentary are the writings of Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift and German priest Martin Luther. Swift decried the appalling conditions faced by Irish Catholics under the rule of the Protestant Ascendancy in &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, while Martin Luther decried corruption in the Catholic Church in his &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;. Examples of social commentators from the lower social strata are Charles Dickens and Will Rogers.

== Forms ==
This list is far from exhaustive. Examples of social commentary may be found in any form of communication. Artistic works of all mediums are often defined by what they say about society. Despite being wordless, the memorable image of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 may be considered one of the most profound commentaries of the power of the individual.

=== Visual artwork ===

Inspiration for some artists can come from issues that are present today. Deborah Silverman, Professor of History and Art History at the University of California in Los Angeles, states that the &quot;Analysis of particular visual forms expands to an interpretation of art and artists as carriers of cultural history in the crucible of modernity.&quot; This notion has been present in art throughout time. An example is Vincent Van Gogh&#x27;s 1885 painting &#x27;The Potato Eaters&#x27;. This picture depicts a group of poverty stricken people gathered in a small room around a table. Vincent Van Gogh created this piece of artwork in order to present a confronting time to the viewer. A modern example is street art, also known as graffiti. With an international reputation, artist and political activist Banksy is known to produce street art that raises public issues such as slave Labour, loss of childhood and the effects of war.

=== Photography ===
Social commentary photography&#x27;s purpose is to &quot;expose social issues on ethics, society, religious, the way of life, how people live and other similarities.&quot; Sometimes this includes the harsh reality of society such as homelessness, discrimination, war and defenceless children. &quot;Social Commentary artists try their best to create artworks in order to convey messages to the community.&quot; Due to the fact that the photos are of real life situations, the contents can be perceived to be more confronting than other visual forms of social commentary. An example are the works of photojournalist and war photographer James Nachtwey. James Nachtwey&#x27;s works include the Rwanda Genocide (1994), the Somalia famine (1992) and the Jakarta Riots (1998) and the September 11 attacks in 2001.

=== Direct publication ===

=== Public speaking ===
Most public speaking constitutes social commentary of some form. Many sermons will describe the ills of society and offer religious solutions. Many politicians may speak in a similar fashion – in Shakespeare&#x27;s Julius Caesar one can see Mark Antony&#x27;s funeral speech as a commentary. The larger audience offered by radio and television has diminished the significance of public speaking as a means of social commentary.

The United Nations General Assembly is one of the biggest global organisations that focus of planet Earth and humans. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) strive to make the Earth a better place, however without the input of many passionate individuals the UNGA would not be able to achieve this. Influential public speakers such as Pope Francis, Malala Yousafzai, President Barack Obama and Queen Elizabeth II, comment of society&#x27;s issues. This allows the UNGA to directly listen to the issues at hand and address them accordingly.

=== Fiction ===
Allegorical fictional works such as &quot;Animal Farm&quot; clearly contain a social commentary and one can find some degree of social commentary in almost any novel. &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; can be interpreted as a commentary on racial issues, especially given the date of its publication (1960). Another example of social commentary is Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; in which he uses the Utopia to satirize the values of 16th century Britain. Social commentaries have been searched for even in fantasy novels such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, though such connections often require much conjecture, or in modern satirical fables.

=== Non-fiction ===
Directly speaking to a topic in the social discourse in writing by defining the audience, the bounds of the topic, and the presenting facts and opinions based on the primarily author and possibly on another&#x27;s perspective.

=== Radio, television and film ===
Fictional works in these mediums have a similar scope to that of their literary counterparts and documentaries to the non-fiction works described above. Television and films often use powerful images to enhance their message, for example, Michael Moore&#x27;s films utilise this to great effect in promoting his political beliefs. Some examples of films include &quot;Food, Inc.&quot;, &quot;The Story of Stuff&quot; featuring Annie Leonard, and Morgan Spurlock&#x27;s &quot;Super Size Me&quot;. And to a lesser degree, the prominent Italian exploitation film &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; uses graphic violence, shocking imagery, and underlying topics in anthropology to express Ruggero Deodato&#x27;s distaste for modern society – more importantly – what it has become. West Indian calypsonians participate annually in songwriting competitions with the common use of double entendre, humour and metaphor as well as monikers to avoid legal complications (see Calypso Music). The slasher film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; also uses animal rights social commentary, in the form of the movie being a metaphor, the chainsaw victims being treated like animals in slaughterhouses and then put into fridges, tenderised, and hung on meat hooks and in an interview, Russel Simmons said: &quot;The way that woman was screaming, ‘Aaaahhh,’ and she&#x27;s running away—that&#x27;s how every animal you eat is running for his or her life&quot;. The shockumentary &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; also provided social commentary, as in one frame, there are dogs being walked in San Francisco and in the other, in Papua New Guinea people are eating dog meat, using cultures different from Western culture to shock the viewer and make them feel uncomfortable. &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; was made to promote &quot;being civil&quot;, and uses language in the film such as &quot;savages&quot;.

=== Dystopian fiction ===
A lot of books and games from the Cyberpunk genre, including 2020 video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; use social commentary usually as a means of questioning technology (ex: &quot;Will technology make us selfish?&quot;) or questioning unethical megacorporations, as in most Cyberpunk plots the megacorporations are antagonised and demonised and Cyberpunk also sheds light on poverty-related issues. The video game series &quot;Watch Dogs,&quot; in which the protagonists are cyber vigilantes that rebel against an all-seeing government, uses social commentary against mass surveillance. 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot; and 1932 book &quot;Brave New World&quot; provide commentary on the Blissful ignorance effect, where in &quot;The Matrix,&quot; the protagonist named Neo can choose the red pill, a dark truth, or the blue pill, a blissful lie to stay in the Matrix or to wake up in the real world and in &quot;Brave New World&quot; the character has a choice whether or not to take soma, a drug used by the totalitarian government to keep the people happy and docile, both inspired by &quot;Plato&#x27;s Cave&quot; which some consider a metaphor for life. 

In a similar situation, the fascist government of video game &quot;We Happy Few&quot; use drugs to keep people in a state of mania, to forget a certain &quot;incident&quot; that occurred and secret police are dispatched to kill people who remember the event or don&#x27;t take the pills and the citizens are forced to wear masks that mold faces in permanent smiles. The main character is presented with a choice at the start of the game: to take the &quot;happiness pill&quot; or to abstain. If the player takes the pill, the game ends and the credits roll, whereas if the player pick the latter, they begin the game. George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; is also written as a critique of totalitarianism.

=== Rap music ===
A lot of hip hop associated with gangsta rap or conscious rap uses sociopolitical commentary, such as N.W.A&#x27;s protest song &quot;Fuck Tha Police&quot; or Chamillionaire and Krayzie Bone&#x27;s &quot;Ridin&quot;, typically against black racial profiling and police brutality and music from gangsta rap artist 2Pac also speak of the poverty in inner cities and racism in the United States and 1991 2Pac song &quot;Trapped&quot; discusses an incident in which 2Pac was assaulted by a police officer and talks about police brutality in the United States. In a 1988 interview about societal perspective, rapper 2Pac said “More kids are being handed crack than being handed diplomas.” and &quot;Society is like that. They’ll let you go as far as you want, but as soon as you start asking too many questions and you’re ready to change, boom, that block will come&quot;. In the interview, he also states his opinions on government action, requesting school classes on drugs, “real” sex education, scams, religious cults, police brutality, apartheid, American racism, poverty, and food insecurity. Other subjects such as foreign languages, are written off by 2Pac, saying that he doesn&#x27;t need to learn German, he says he can hardly pay his rent, let alone book a flight to Germany.

== Monologists ==

An early radio monologist was the American Will Rogers, with sharp and good-humored observations upon society during the 1920s and 1930s. Current American monologists include:

*Jay Leno
*Garrison Keillor
*Jon Stewart
*Stephen Colbert
*Craig Ferguson
*David Letterman
*Conan O&#x27;Brien
*Bill Maher
*Jimmy Fallon
*Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell
== Discussion shows ==

There are a number of discussion shows that do not have a call in segments, but which sometimes have discussions (beyond mere interviews) with personages of current interest. In the United States of America, some such shows include:
*Jay Leno
*David Letterman
*Oprah Winfrey
*Steve Harvey

== Talk shows (call-in) ==
In the late 20th century through the present, radio and television phone-in shows allow limited discussion and sometimes debate on such issues, although if involving politics or issues exploited for political purposes the discussion is often directed by the &quot;moderator&quot; toward a specific point of view, typically by terminating non-conforming phone calls.

In more balanced forums it is common that a panel of well-known social commentators or experts on aspects of a topic will respond to comments from listeners after an introductory interactive discussion directed by the moderator, with only the obstreperous or extreme caller summarily terminated.

=== Newspapers and comic books ===
What is probably the most common social commentary is that of the editorial section of newspapers, where columnists give their opinion on current affairs. The letters section of papers allows a similar platform for members of the public. Editorial cartoons, such as those in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, perform a social commentary, often with a humorous slant.

The conventional comic section is more limited, but sometimes with social commentary, often subtle and oblique, or more bold, abrasive, and consistently pointed as in, Li&#x27;l Abner, Pogo, Doonesbury, Bloom County, and Boondocks or in pulp comics such as Howard the Duck. Many other even more explicitly provocative comics (usually with a far left of center point of view) appear in various free weekly newspapers such as the San Francisco Bay Guardian and the East Bay Express (in the San Francisco Bay Area) and the Village Voice (in New York City), and similarly in many other locals, often those with a strong university or college presence.

=== The Internet ===
The web performs a similar function to the letters section described above. It is ripe with social commentary because it allows the dissemination of ideas by anyone with a computer to a potentially enormous audience, as well as instant comment and discussion. Its international scope is particularly attractive, with language the only major barrier to communication. Discussion and debate occurs in many forums and chat rooms.

<text>TVW is a television station broadcasting in Perth, Western Australia, wholly owned by Seven West Media. It was the first television station in Western Australia, commencing broadcasting on 16 October 1959. It broadcasts a modulated 64-QAM signal of five DVB channels (Seven Network, 7two, 7mate, 7flix and Racing.com). The primary channel was available as a PAL-B modulated simulcast on VHF channel 7 at 182.25 MHz before being discontinued in the first half of 2013; it had been the station&#x27;s primary signal since its inception. The TVW callsign stands for TV (Television) Western Australia.

==History==

On 13 October 1958, the first commercial television licence in Perth was granted by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to TVW Limited, a subsidiary of West Australian Newspapers (WAN), publisher of Perth&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;The West Australian&quot;. Under the then founding general manager of the station James Cruthers, TVW commenced broadcasting on 16 October 1959. The Governor of Western Australia, Sir Charles Gairdner opened the station at 7.30pm that night. Some of the first programs included &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Epilogue&quot; and a local show called &quot;Spotlight&quot; which featured Rolf Harris.

The signal was broadcast from the station&#x27;s transmitter site at Bickley in the Darling Ranges.

TVW-7 did not have a rival commercial television station until 1965 when STW-9 commenced broadcasting. However the presence of a rival did not have a large negative impact on TVW, at least in the early years. In fact a survey by its rival found that more people agreed with a statement that &quot;TVW fulfilled their viewing needs, and it would be a matter of indifference to them if the new station were to cease transmissions&quot;. The advantage TVW built up in its six years as sole commercial operator flowed through for many more years to come, some would even argue that it is still present today considering how well Seven performs in the market compared to Nine, which for nearly two decades until the mid-2000s, generally won comfortably nationally.

After STW-9 entered the market, a &quot;cartel&quot; was formed between the two stations for the duty of buying from both Australian and overseas production sources. The two stations set up a separate company, TV Facilities (the two stations being 50%/50% partners). This allowed the stations to purchase programs cheaper than if they were two separate entities, which would bid on shows and subsequently raise prices. This partnership was disliked by Eastern States stations who could not increase their charges to the extent which they would have liked. Allocation of programs was decided by a coin toss, which would allow the winner to pick first and then alternate the picking of programs. However TVW would always be in a more dominant position as it had the rights to continuing shows from the previous six years as well as half of the new programs.

In 1971 TVW Enterprises purchased SAS-10 in Adelaide, now SAS-7. Eight years later, TVW finally took on an affiliation, aligning with the Seven stations in the East. In 1982 TVW and SAS were purchased by Bell Group. This soon posed a problem for SAS, since Network Ten officials were unwilling to discuss network plans with Bell given that it owned a Ten affiliate and a Seven affiliate. To solve this problem, SAS swapped affiliations and frequencies with Adelaide&#x27;s original Seven affiliate, ADS, in 1987.

In 1988, Perth finally got full network service when NEW signed on and aligned with Ten. In 1988, TVW was sold to Qintex. Qintex collapsed a year later, leaving TVW in the hands of receivers. In 1991 the network was floated on the stock exchange and, by 1995, Kerry Stokes was in charge of both TVW and the rest of the network. Since then, the station has continued to enjoy a dominant share of television ratings in the Perth market.

TVW commenced digital television transmission in January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 6 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 7.

The analogue signal for TVW was shut off at 09:00 on 16 April 2013.

During the digital switchover in Perth, the final image for TVW’s analogue signal was an advertisement break of a Toyota car ad before Sunrise.

Stokes bought a 15 percent stake in West Australian newspapers in 2006. In 2011, West Australian Newspapers bought the Seven Network to form Seven West Media, thus fully reuniting TVW with its founding owner. In February 2015, TVW moved from their original broadcasting facility in Gay Street, Dianella to a new HD broadcast centre in Osborne Park located within West Australian Newspapers.

==News and current affairs==

===&quot;Seven News&quot;===
&quot;Seven News Perth&quot; is directed by Ray Kuka and presented by Rick Ardon and Susannah Carr on weeknights and Angela Tsun and Tim McMillan on weekends from Seven and West Australian Newspaper studios located at Osborne Park. Sport is presented by Ryan Daniels on weeknights and Adrian Barich on weekends. Weather is presented by Samantha Jolly on weeknights and Charlotte Goodlet on weekends. &quot;Seven News Perth&quot; is also simulcast on Seven Regional WA formerly GWN7 network to regional and remote areas on Western Australia and Curtin FM in the Perth metropolitan area, but as of 2016, the simulcast on radio had a broadcasting break.

Long standing &quot;Seven News Perth&quot; presenter Jeff Newman announced his retirement from television on 1 July 2009, and retired from his role on Monday 10 August 2009. He was replaced by former &quot;Nine News Perth&quot; weather presenter Natalia Cooper, who began her new role during September 2009. Cooper resigned from Seven Perth at the end of 2012 with ex-Nine weather presenter Angela Tsun taking over as her replacement for the 4:30pm news and 6pm weather forecasts.

In 2015, Rick Ardon and Susannah Carr celebrated a thirty-year anniversary as a news reading duo. They are one of the longest serving dual news presenter teams in the world and the dual-presenter format used by &quot;Seven News Perth&quot; has been highly successful. In contrast to previous struggles seen in Sydney and Melbourne in the late 1990s, &quot;Seven News Perth&quot; has led in the ratings for decades, well ahead of 10 News First Perth and Nine News Perth by as many as 100,000 viewers.

In February 2020, the Seven Network announced that Tim McMillan would join Angela Tsun to present on weekends.

In February 2022, Basil Zempilas left his nightly sport duties due to other commitments and being the Lord Mayor of Perth, he was replaced by Ryan Daniels but remained a fill-in.

News updates for Perth are presented by Angela Tsun, Susannah Carr or Rick Ardon throughout the afternoon and by Susannah Carr or Rick Ardon in the early evening. Yvette Mooney was the weekend news presenter until she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 and subsequently left the network in June 2008. Before the move to the Osborne Park Studios in February 2015, Blake Johnson and Samantha Jolly alternated fortnightly presenting for both Weekend bulletins. Fill-in presenters include Tina Altieri, Elle Georgiou, Amelia Broun, Samantha Jolly (News) and Anna Hay (Sport).

===Presenters===
====Former presenters====
* Yvette Mooney (weekends) – died in 2022

===&quot;Today Tonight&quot;===
Between 1995 and 2019, the nightly news was followed by a locally produced edition of current affairs program &quot;Today Tonight&quot; hosted by Monika Kos. The program used a mixture of reports from its sister program in Adelaide as well as reports from locally based reporters. Like &quot;Seven News Perth&quot;, the program was very successful ratings wise, consistently beating its rival &quot;A Current Affair&quot;.

On 29 November 2019, the show along with its Adelaide counterpart was axed. This followed the axings of the combined Sydney and Melbourne edition, as well as the Queensland edition, in 2014.

==Mascot==
Seven Perth has long been the home of Fat Cat, the name standing for Francis Aloysius Thomas Cat. Fat Cat is &quot;put to bed&quot; every night at 7.30pm signalling the end of programs suitable for children. Fat Cat, is the last WA television mascot to survive. Longtime rival STW-9 used a large elephant, Flapper, as its mascot and NEW-10 used &quot;Kenny Kidna&quot; from the Kangaroo Creek Gang as its mascot in addition to GWN’s Doopa Dog from at least 1972 until 2022.

Fat Cat is now mainly used for things to do with Telethon; Fat Cat dolls are sold through Friendlies Chemists &amp; Bendigo Bank for $19.95 to raise money for Telethon.

Seven also has an anthropomorphic TV character &quot;TV Man&quot; (an analogue TV with arms and legs with a red 7 on the screen) as a popular mascot used in on air promos nationally.

==Telethon==
TVW also produces an annual Telethon for the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, now relocated and named Perth Children&#x27;s Hospital, the Telethon Kids Institute and around forty other beneficiaries spread throughout the Western Australian community. Since 1968 it has raised over $500 million (as of 2023 total). Although the fundraising takes place 365 days a year through the community, it culminates in a 26-hour live broadcast from RAC Arena in the heart of Perth city over a weekend, usually in October. Seven network personalities fly to Perth for the weekend to help raise money, as do a lot of Aussie artists. Many international stars have also been part of Telethon over the years, including Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Celine Dion and Harry Connick Jr. The show is simulcasted around the state of Western Australia. This telethon is regarded as the highest fundraising Telethon (per capita) in the world ($13.94 per head of population in WA). In 2017 Channel 7 celebrated its milestone 50th Perth Telethon, raising $36.4m ($10m more than the previous year&#x27;s record amount) and distributed this to over forty beneficiaries throughout Western Australia. It is broadcast on TVW7 across Perth metro area and across Western Australia.
==Christmas Pageant==
The station organises an annual Christmas parade through the streets of the Perth central business district, traditionally on the first Saturday of December. It is claimed to be the largest Christmas parade in the southern hemisphere. More than 600 floats and 60,000 participants have taken part in the procession in the history of the parade, which commenced in 1972. Each year several thousand people line the route to watch the parade. It was cancelled twice, in 2015 due to inclement weather and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

==Broadcasting details==

Digital transport frequency: VHF-6 @ 177.5 MHz (Bandwidth: 7 MHz 64-QAM)

Note: HD quality switches between 7 and 7mate due to sporting events. Only one channel broadcasts HD at any one time.

<text>Royal Air Force Elvington or more simply RAF Elvington is a former Royal Air Force satellite station which operated from the beginning of the Second World War until 1992 located at Elvington, Yorkshire, England. It is now the location of the Yorkshire Air Museum.

==History==

===Royal Air Force use===
The station was originally a grass airfield within No. 4 Group RAF. In the early 1940s the airfield was entirely reconstructed with three hardened runways replacing the grass. It re-opened in October 1942 as a station for 77 Squadron RAF and along with RAF Melbourne and RAF Pocklington was known as &quot;No. 42 Base&quot;. The squadron had a strength of approximately 20 aircraft and initially used the twin engined Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber although this was quickly replaced by the Handley Page Halifax four engined heavy bomber which was being introduced. No. 77 Squadron suffered heavy losses during its time at Elvington with over 500 aircrew killed, missing or taken prisoner and almost 80 Halifaxes lost as it played a major part in the Battle of the Ruhr and the bombing of Berlin.

In May 1944 No. 77 Squadron posted to the newly opened nearby RAF Full Sutton and was replaced at Elvington by two French squadrons, numbers 346 &quot;Guyenne&quot; and 347 &quot;Tunisie&quot; who both played a leading part in the bombing of Germany. Elvington was the only airfield in the United Kingdom used by the remainder of the Free French Forces, they also flew Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers until they moved to Bordeaux in October 1945 where they became the basis for the new air force of liberated France. In September 1957 a memorial was unveiled in Elvington village dedicated to the two French squadrons. While they were at RAF Elvington nearly half of the squadrons&#x27; members were killed.

After the war the airfield was transferred to No. 40 Group RAF under the control of RAF Maintenance Command until 1952 when it was greatly enlarged and extended for use by the United States Air Force.

===United States Air Force use===

The United States Air Force (USAF) built a new runway, which was the longest in the north of England, and a huge rectangular hardstanding apron as well as a new control tower to turn Elvington into a &quot;Basic Operation Platform&quot; which would have operated as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) dispersal airfield. After spending £4 million the airfield never became operational as a SAC base and was abandoned by the US Air Force in 1958.

===Other uses===

In the early 1960s the Blackburn Aircraft Company, now part of British Aerospace used the runway for test flights of the Blackburn Buccaneer. Elvington retained its status as an RAF relief landing ground and was used by the RAF flying training schools at RAF Church Fenton and RAF Linton-on-Ouse until the airfield was finally closed in March 1992.

===Units===
The following units were also here at some point:
==Motorsport==
A race circuit was established which appears to have been used by the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC). The inaugural car race meeting took place on 8 July 1962 and was reported by &quot;Autosport&quot;, which said that the BRSCC hoped to run a further meeting September, but this appears not to have taken place. A second meeting did take place a year after on 7 July 1963, but these two appear to have been the sum total of car racing at Elvington.

However, in June 1970 Auto 66 Club held a Motorcycle Road Race meeting at Elvington, with a second meeting in September. The following season these were upgraded to National Status events. Although local critics thought the club had gone well over the top, the National event attracted over 400 riders, including stars of the future like Mick Grant and Barry Sheene. The Auto 66 Club continued to organise meetings at this track.

==Record breaking==
In October 1969, when preparing for a challenge at the Monza high-speed banked-oval circuit to a record held by Moto Guzzi, Ray Pickrell practiced by riding a Dunstall Norton road-going motorcycle during a regular sprint meeting. He set a new national record for the 750 cc class flying quarter mile at .

On 3 October 1970 Tony Densham, driving the Ford-powered &quot;Commuter&quot; dragster, set the Official outright wheel driven record at Elvington by averaging over the flying kilometre course. This broke Malcolm Campbell&#x27;s record set 43 years previously at Pendine Sands.

In 1990 Elvington hosted an attempt to match the speed record run of the Sunbeam Tiger motor car, originally driven by Henry Segrave (on 21 March 1926, he set his first land speed record in his 4-litre Sunbeam Tiger &quot;Ladybird&quot; on the sands at Southport, England at 152.33 mph). The re-run at Elvington on the two mile (3 km) runway was recorded at .

In the summer of 1998 Colin Fallows bettered Richard Noble&#x27;s outright UK Record, driving his &quot;Vampire&quot; jet dragster at Elvington with an average of . The current non wheel-driven British Land Speed Record holder is Vampire, driven by Fallows, which hit a speed of on 5 July 2000 at Elvington.

On 20 September 2006 Elvington Airfield was the location of a serious crash involving the &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter Richard Hammond and &quot;Vampire&quot;. The jet-powered car he was driving crashed while travelling at . Hammond suffered serious brain injuries, but made a full recovery. The accident investigation said: &quot;an almost instantaneous blow out of the right side front tyre caused the accident.&quot;

World records for the fastest Wheelie bin at , and the fastest electric wheelchair at were set in 2020.

Zef Eisenberg of MADMAX Race team, who holds numerous land speed records, crashed his 560 hp Rolls-Royce Turbine powered motorbike at Elvington airfield on 18 September 2016, during a two way speed record attempt. It was reported that he did not see the finish line, causing him to leave the end of the runway and crash at a speed of around 230 mph. He sustained 11 broken bones and was hospitalised for three months. It was believed to be Britain&#x27;s fastest motorbike crash survivor. After rebuilding his Turbine powered bike and making a recovery that surprised the doctors, he was racing again on the anniversary of the crash at the same track and on the same (rebuilt) bike. On the afternoon of 1 October 2020, Eisenberg died in a collision whilst attempting to set a British land speed record.

In 2019 Guy Martin set a new speed record for driving a tractor at the site. In a series of runs in a JCB Fastrac Two he averaged and reached a peak speed of .

In 2023 Professional Skateboarder and presenter Ryan Swain announced he was to attempt a Guinness World Records in skateboarding at Elvington on 8 May 2023 in aid of Mind mental health charity. He will be attempting to skateboard over 300 miles in less than 24 hours and will be the first GB Skateboarder to hold the record if completed.

On 25 May 2023, engineer Allen Millyard together with television presenter Henry Cole set a world motorcycle speed-record, ratified by Guinness World Records at , achieved with the pair riding &quot;tandem&quot; on the one-off, road-legal hand-made Millyard Viper, beating by two mph the previous record held by an American couple for over 10 years.

==Present day==
The airfield is now owned by Elvington Park Ltd. The adjacent buildings and control tower have been restored, and serve as the Yorkshire Air Museum which has many varied and rare aircraft and exhibits, including a complete Halifax bomber.
Elvington is also a popular motorsports venue for motorcycle racing.

<doc id="904281" wikidata="Q352133" url="?curid=904281" title="Anund Jacob">
<text>Anund Jacob or James (Old Norse: &quot;Ǫnundr Jakob&quot;; Swedish: &quot;Anund Jakob&quot;; c. 25 July 1008/10 - c. 1050) was King of Sweden from 1022 until around 1050. He is believed to have been born on 25 July, in either 1008 or 1010 as &quot;Jakob&quot;, the son of King Olof Skötkonung and Queen Estrid. Being the second Christian king of the Swedish realm, his long and partly turbulent reign saw the increasing dissemination of Christianity as well as repeated attempts to influence the balance of power in Scandinavia. Throughout his reign, he tried to subvert the rising Danish hegemony in Scandinavia by supporting the Norwegian monarchy. He also supported the reign of his brother-in-law Yaroslav the Wise in Kievan Rus. He is referred to in positive terms in German and Norse historical sources. His reign was one of the longest in Sweden during the Viking Age and Middle Ages.

==Accession==

The main sources for Anund Jacob&#x27;s reign are the near-contemporary ecclesiastic chronicle of Adam of Bremen and several Norse histories from the 12th and 13th centuries, in particular Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Heimskringla. Adam and Snorri both relate that Anund Jacob&#x27;s father Olof Skötkonung (c. 995–1022) ran into trouble with his subjects towards the end of his reign. According to Adam, the still pagan population of Svealand urged the fervently Christian ruler to withdraw to Västergötland. Snorri, on the other hand, asserts that King Olof&#x27;s high-handed rule caused the Swedes to rise against him, whereby his young son Jacob was hailed as king. When the Swedish Thing was to elect him the ruler of Sweden, the people objected to his non-Scandinavian name. They then gave him the name of &quot;Anund&quot;. Olof and Anund Jacob eventually came to an agreement: Olof was to retain his royal title for the rest of his life, but Anund Jacob would be co-ruler and govern part of the realm, and had to support the peasantry if Olof caused further trouble. In Snorri&#x27;s chronology this happened in c. 1019. Three years later Olof died, leaving Anund Jacob as the sole ruler.

==Political agenda==

Indigenous Swedish historiography has preserved very meager recollections of the pre-1250 rulers, but points out Anund Jacob as a heavy-handed master. The enumeration of kings appended to the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot; (c. 1240) says that he had the epithet of &quot;Kolbränna&quot; (&quot;Coal-burner&quot;) as he had the habit of burning down the houses of his opponents. This may refer to the practice known from medieval Sweden of legally burning the houses of people who opposed the authorities. A different opinion of his character is given by Adam of Bremen: &quot;Certainly he was young of years, but he surpassed all his predecessors in wisdom and piety. No king was as beloved by the Swedish people as Anund&quot;. The Norse sagas emphasize his amicable and helpful attitude to his royal Norwegian kinsmen.

Anund Jacob continued the minting of coins in Sigtuna in Central Sweden; however, the issuing of coins was broken off later during his reign, and was only resumed by King Canute I in the late 12th century. Snorri mentions Central Sweden, Västergötland and Småland among the regions ruled by Anund Jacob, but his ideas of Sweden might be influenced by conditions in the High Middle Ages. A poem from the 1040s, describing a Norwegian battle against Danes and Swedish auxiliaries, suggests that at least some Geats stood under Anund Jacob: &quot;Geatic shield and hauberk / did I bring home from the battle&quot;.

According to Adam of Bremen, Christianity reached rather widely in the reign of Anund Jacob, with missionary work led by Bishop Thurgot of Skara in Västergötland until 1030 when he was nominally succeeded by Gottskalk. Both were appointed by the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. Gottskalk, however, was a passive church magnate who preferred to stay home in Germany. An English missionary, Sigfrid, filled the void to an extent. From a Norwegian base, he visited Sweden, Götaland &quot;and all the islands beyond the northern land&quot;.

King Anund Jacob&#x27;s political agenda included maintaining the balance of power in Scandinavia, which is why he supported the Norwegian kings Olaf II (Olav the Saint) and Magnus I against Denmark&#x27;s and England&#x27;s king Cnut the Great during the 1020s and 1030s. According to Snorri, Cnut tried to neutralize Anund Jacob, when a dispute flared up with Olaf around 1025, by sending him rich presents and offers of friendship. However, the envoys noted Anund Jacob&#x27;s strong affinity to Olaf, who was married to his sister Astrid. In fact Anund Jacob traveled with a large entourage to Kungahälla where he met Olaf for a friendly parley. Some time later, when Cnut was away tending his English kingdom, Olaf attacked and ravaged Sjaelland, while Anund Jacob came down with a fleet from Svealand to attack Scania. The allies combined their forces and awaited Cnut, who returned from England with a superior fleet in 1026. While the late Norse accounts are highly unreliable, some details of the war are mentioned in contemporary scaldic verses and confirm Anund Jacob&#x27;s intervention.

==The Battle of Helgeå==

According to Snorri&#x27;s account of the Battle of Helgeå, the Swedish and Norwegian fleets arrived at the estuary of Helge å on the east coast of Scania. There they prepared a trap by building a levee of wooden branches and turf close to the estuary. When Cnut&#x27;s fleet approached, the levee was torn down and the rushing water and floating logs created disorder in the Danish fleet. However, many Danish ships were soon ready to confront the Swedes and Norwegians. In the face of the superior enemy, Anund Jacob and Olaf withdrew. Olaf later sneaked back to Norway with his entourage via Småland and Västergötland.

The actual circumstances of the Battle of Helgeå are debated among historians due to conflicting sources. The near-contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle asserts, under the year 1025 (error for 1026): &quot;This year King Cnut went to Denmark with a fleet to the holm by the holy river [Helge å]; where against him there came Ulf and Eilaf, with a very large force both by land and sea, from Sweden. There were very many men lost on the side of King Cnut, both of Danish and English; and the Swedes had possession of the field of battle.&quot; The identity of Ulf and Eilaf (probably subordinate officers to Anund Jacob) is not known - possibly they are identical with two brothers by that name who were sons of the Swedish or Geatish magnate Ragnvald Ulfsson. They could also be the Anglo-Danish Ulf Jarl and his brother Eilaf, since some late accounts allege that Ulf fought on the Swedish-Norwegian side in the war. A contemporary scaldic verse by Sigvat Thordarson partly conforms with Snorri by stating that Cnut beat back or stopped the Swedish attack (Svíum hnekkðir Þu) and defended his realm against two kings. However, this is a poem in praise of Cnut and thus not an impartial source. It is therefore not entirely clear if Anund Jacob and Olaf were victorious over or defeated by Cnut. It has even been suggested that the battle in fact was fought in southeastern Uppland, where a river appears to have been called &quot;Helgå&quot; in the Middle Ages. According to that hypothesis, the site fits the topographical details of Snorri&#x27;s account much better than eastern Scaniae.

Thus, the results of the war are not clear in either of the sources. It is obvious, however, that the Swedish-Norwegian attack failed, since Cnut remained master of his realm and was able to make a pilgrimage to Rome in 1027. On his way back to Denmark he dictated a letter, saying that he intended to make peace with the peoples and nations which had tried to deprive him of his kingdom and life but had failed since God deprived them of their power. In the following year Olaf II was driven from Norway and Cnut was hailed as overlord in his stead. Cnut also claimed to be king over part of the Swedes in these years. Coins in the name of Cnut were minted in Svealand at about the same time. All this suggests that the peoples around Lake Mälaren may have ousted Anund Jacob for a while, and hailed Cnut. The possibility of a brief Danish suzerainty in Central Sweden has engendered considerable debate; on one hand Cnut&#x27;s coins might simply be copied from the Anglo-Danish coinage in a mechanical way, but on the other hand a number of numismatists have argued that the coins are too original in making to be considered copies. Curiously, coins stating that the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung was King of England have also been found in Sigtuna. At any rate King Anund Jacob was in power again around 1030.

==Supporting Magnus the Good==

When expelled by Cnut, Olaf II of Norway went via Sweden to Kievan Rus with his son Magnus. In 1030 he made an attempt to regain his throne. Anund Jacob provided him with a force of 400 skilled men, and allowed him to recruit as many men as possible from his realm. Olaf&#x27;s plan seems to have been to bypass the Danish fleet typically stationed close to Öresund and try to seize the then Norwegian capital of Nidaros directly by entering through Jämtland. Snorri Sturluson reports that Anund Jacob provided Olaf with pathfinders that guided him through the treacherous terrain of Dalarna to reach the then Norwegian province of Härjedalen. However, Olaf was killed fighting a Norwegian peasant army at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Five years later his son Magnus came over to Sigtuna in Sweden from Rus and met with his stepmother Astrid Olofsdotter, Anund Jacob&#x27;s sister. According to Snorri&#x27;s account, supported by a number of contemporary scaldic verses, Astrid advocated Magnus&#x27;s cause at a thing in Hangrar. A sizable force of Swedish warriors gathered under Magnus, who invaded Norway via Hälsingland in 1035. The enterprise was a great success and the pretender was hailed as king (Magnus I, Magnus the Good). Cnut the Great died in the same year and his sons lacked his capacity. When the last of them, Harthacnut, died in 1042, Magnus inherited Denmark as well. Anund Jacob&#x27;s policy of maintaining a Nordic power balance can be seen in the agenda shift that followed. Anund Jacob kept Cnut&#x27;s nephew Sweyn Estridsen as a protégé and supported his pretensions to the Danish throne. As related by both Snorri and Adam of Bremen, Sweyn made repeated attempts to establish his authority in Denmark, only to be defeated by King Magnus on each occasion. After every defeat, he found refuge with Anund Jacob in Sweden. Magnus died in 1047 and bequeathed Norway to his uncle Harald Hardrada, while Sweyn&#x27;s right to the Danish throne was acknowledged. In spite of that, a new war flared up between Sweyn and Harald, where Anund Jacob seems to have continued supporting Sweyn. The struggle was still on when Anund Jacob died.

==Eastern politics==

The Russian Nestor Chronicle relates that the &quot;Varyag prince&quot; &quot;Yakun&quot;, dressed in a golden cloak, led an eastbound Swedish expedition to the other side of the Baltic Sea in 1024. He provided military reinforcements to Yaroslav I the Wise (Anund Jacob&#x27;s brother in law) in a battle against Mstislav of Chernigov. The battle was fought during a thunderstorm and ended in a defeat for the allies, and Yakun went back across the sea. According to Gudmund Jöran Adlerbeth of the Swedish Academy (1802), Yakun was identical with King Anund Jacob and was blind. Alternatively, the name Yakun could correspond to someone named &quot;Håkan&quot;, unknown in the history of the era.

Anund Jacob took tribute from the Baltic people called Semigallians or in the Yngvars saga the Baltic Seimgalir. The tribe had refused to pay taxes to Olof Skötkonung for some time so Olof sent Anund Jacob his son and Ingvar to reestablish the tax system. With three ships, they arrived to convince the Semigallian leaders to continue to pay taxes to the Swedes, as they were the tribes in the Baltic area that refused to pay such taxes. Most Semigallian chieftains and their king now accepted paying tributes to Sweden. Due to Ingvar&#x27;s convincing persuasion, the Semigallians and Swedes reached an agreement.

Three tribal Semigallian chieftains, however, refused to pay the tributes and armed their troops to banish the Swedes. A war followed which the Swedes won after lethal battles. The Semigallian king provided Anumnd Jacob and Ingvar with soldiers to defeat the rebels, and the most rebellious Semigallian leader was captured and hanged. The two other chieftains escaped. The Vikings or Swedes took plenty of gold, silver and precious things from the Semigallian rebels after the war. Ingvar became the most powerful chief in Sweden after the king.

Olof Skötkonung received the tribute from the Semigallians after the war. 

A major Swedish Viking expedition to the east led by Ingvar occurred around 1040 and is mentioned on a large number of rune stones from Central Sweden. Judging from the inscriptions the enterprise ended up in Serkland (the Muslim lands to the southeast of Russia), apparently under disastrous circumstances. A late Icelandic saga contains all sorts of fantastic details about the expedition.

==Death and succession==

Anund Jacob&#x27;s reign has traditionally been dated from 1022 to approximately 1050, but there is uncertainty about the year he died. He was probably alive in 1049, since Adam places his death after the death of the Danish prince Bjørn, an earl in England, in that year; his half-brother and successor Emund is certain to have ruled Sweden in the summer of 1060. According to Adam of Bremen, Anund Jacob was married to a certain Gunhild who might previously have been the wife of Sven Estridsen. Adam does not suggest that they had any children, but a later chronicler Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1200) says that Sweyn Estridsen&#x27;s spouse Gyda was a daughter of the Swedish king, by implication Anund Jacob. It has been suggested by Birger Nerman and others that King Anund Jacob was buried where &quot;King Ane&#x27;s Stone&quot; is located in West Gothland.

Two skalds are known to have served Anund Jacob: Sighvatr Þórðarson and Óttarr svarti.

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; from the 13th century concludes with a chronicle of the Swedish kings which briefly epitomizes Anund Jacob&#x27;s reign:

<doc id="904284" wikidata="Q5888672" url="?curid=904284" title="Home Rule Party of Hawaii">
<text>The Hawaiian Independent Party (later renamed the Independent Home Rule Party), was a political party active in Hawaii from 1900 to 1912, during which time Hawaii was controlled by the United States and administered as the Territory of Hawaii. The Party was established by Robert Wilcox, immediately after the United States annexed the Hawaiian Islands with the Newlands Resolution in 1898 and established the Territory of Hawaii with the Hawaiian Organic Act in 1900. The party was formed to represent and advocate for the rights and interests of Native Hawaiians, many of whom were then inclined to believe that both the Democratic Party of Hawai‘i and Hawai‘i Republican Party were yet incapable of representing them.

==Formation==
On June 6, 1900, Robert Wilcox, returned to Hawaii from the mainland U.S., which he had visited in order to advocate for the inclusion native Hawaiian rights in the Organic Act. Upon his return, Wilcox spoke to a rally sponsored by Hui Aloha ʻĀina and Hui Kalaiāina, the two main Hawaiian political clubs. In his speech, he said, &quot;The question of the restoration of the Monarchy is gone from us forever. We are now a people, however, who can vote. You all know we have two-thirds of the votes in this country.&quot;

==Legislature==
In the first election in 1900 the ruling Republican Party (formerly the Reform Party) misjudged the voting demographics under the territorialship, though the new government excluded Asians, women, and other minorities, it allowed more people to become eligible voters, swinging the voting majority toward Native Hawaiians. The Home Rule Party succeeded on a nationalist platform in becoming the majority party in the Territorial Senate. In the Territorial House of Representatives, the Home Rule party gained a plurality, but importantly not a majority, of the seats. They sent Robert William Wilcox to represent the territory in the United States Congress. On November 11, 1900, the &quot;Independent Home Rule Party&quot; was formally established, and the two anti-annexation groups that formed it, Hui Aloha ʻĀina and Hui Kālaiāina, were officially dissolved.

As a newly elected delegate from Hawaii, Wilcox proved to be fairly ineffective. On the floor of the United States House of Representatives, Wilcox was challenged by his poor command of the English language, and his lack of alignment with either of the main parties (Democrat and Republican). Although upon his election, he took a more moderate tone, the Home Rule Party proved to be obstructionist and was blamed for a distinct lack of progress in the Territorial legislature. One particular political miscalculation of note was Wilcox&#x27;s support of the so-called leper bill, which cost him a great deal of support amongst his native Hawaiian base.

The Home Rule Party controlled Territorial Legislature of 1901 has been negatively cast as an ineffective and chaotic in the historical narrative of Hawaii, although recent scholarship have painted a different picture. During the period they controlled both chambers of the legislature. They attempted to pass new laws in the interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a government-funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They insisted on the use of both Hawaiian and English in the legislature with the aide of an interpreter, ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature. Many of the legislators in this session did not speak English.

However, their agenda was obstructed by the Republicans and the appointed members of territorial government, especially Governor Sanford B. Dole. In this session, the Home Rulers attempted to decentralize control away from the governor and empower local government by passing a bill creating the first counties in Hawaii. The bill would have created five counties: County of Lunalilo (Kauai and Niihau), County of Liliuokalani (Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe), County of Kauikeaouli (Hawaii including Hilo, Puna and Kau), County of Kamehameha (Hawaii including Hamakua, North Kohala, South Kohala, South Kona and North Kona), County of Kalohana (Oahu). This county bill was defeated by Dole through a pocket veto after the prorogation of the regular session. The legislative assembly was later mockingly dubbed the &quot;Lady Dog Legislature&quot; because of extensive legislative debate on House Bill No. 15, An Act To Amend Section 814, Chapter 59, of the Civil Laws, by Representative Simon H. Haaheo which would have repealed an 1898 tax on ownership of female dogs. This nickname was used by opponents of the Home Rulers to denigrate the group and the difficulties of the 1901 legislature would later be used as evidence of the incompetence of Native Hawaiian political leadership.

==Decline==

On July 10, 1902, Prince Kuhio split from the Home Rule Party, walking out of its convention along with nearly half of the delegates there. He formed the short-lived Hui Kuokoa Party. However, by September 1, 1902, Kuhio decided to join the Republican Party, was nominated as their candidate for Congress, and dramatically altered the political landscape. Election day, November 4, 1902, proved to be devastating to the Home Rule Party. Republicans won 26 legislative seats, the Home Rulers 9, and the Democrats one.

After Wilcox&#x27;s death, the party ran Charles Kahiliaulani Notley against Kuhio for another decade losing the election each time. The party steadily lost ground to the Republican party in the legislative and county elections. However, they still ran candidates during each election. For example, Maui politician William Pūnohu White ran unsuccessfully in every election between 1902 and 1914 to regain the senate seat after his brief stint in the first Territorial legislature. The Home Rule Party eventually disbanded in 1912.

==Aloha ʻĀina Party==

In 1997, the Aloha ʻĀina Party of Hawaii was established by UH dance instructor Vicky Holt Takamine as a putative reestablishment of the Home Rule Party. The party&#x27;s philosophy is conservationism and nationalism.

<text>Emund the Old (Old Norse: &quot;Eymundr gamli&quot;; Old Swedish: &quot;Æmunðær gamlæ&quot;, &quot;Æmunðær gammal&quot;, &quot;Æmunðær slemæ&quot;; Swedish: &quot;Emund den gamle&quot;; died c. 1060) was King of Sweden from c. 1050 to c. 1060. His short reign was characterised by disputes with the Archbishopric of Bremen over church policies, and a historically debated delimitation of the Swedish-Danish border.

==Way to the throne==

Emund was the son of Olof Skötkonung, the first Christian ruler of Sweden. His mother was a co-wife, Edla, daughter of a Slavic chief from the southern coast of the Baltic Sea. He had two uterine sisters called Astrid and Holmfrid. His half-siblings, born by Olof&#x27;s legitimate Queen Estrid of the Obotrites, were Anund Jacob and Ingegerd. According to the 13th-century historian Snorri Sturluson, Estrid was ill-tempered and treated her stepchildren poorly. King Olof later sent Emund to be raised with his mother&#x27;s Slavic family. While staying there he failed to hold on to the Christian religion.

Olof was succeeded by his other son Anund Jacob, who however did not have any known sons of his own. Snorri relates that Emund was ruling in Sigtuna, an important center in the Swedish realm, by 1035. However, other sources show that Anund Jacob was still alive then; the names Anund and Emund might have been mixed up. The German ecclesiastical chronicler Adam of Bremen, in his &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum&quot; (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church), says that Anund Jacob died in or shortly after 1049 and was succeeded by Emund; there is nothing to suggest that the succession was irregular.

==Conflict with Bremen==

Our only near-contemporary source for Emund&#x27;s reign is Adam of Bremen, who paints a very negative picture of the new ruler. This is mainly due to the self-willed attitude of Emund vis-à-vis the Archdiocese of Bremen. Adam relates that Emund was baptised but cared very little for the Christian faith. He also gives Emund the cognomen &quot;pessimus&quot; (worst), which is later reflected by the short chronicle of the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot; (c. 1240) which likewise knows the king as &quot;Slemme&quot;, the bad. The &quot;Westrogothic law&quot; states that Emund was a disagreeable man when wanting to pursue a goal.

The dispute with Bremen was triggered by Emund&#x27;s insistence on maintaining a bishop called Osmundus. Originally a protégé of the Norwegian-based missionary Sigfrid, Osmundus had been raised at a school in Bremen but failed to be ordained bishop by the Pope. Eventually he was ordained by the Polish archbishop of Gniezno and proceeded to Sweden where he won the confidence of King Emund. In the mid-1050s the Archbishop of Bremen sent envoys to Sweden, headed by Adalvard the Elder who was intended as the new bishop. The delegation was highly offended when encountering Osmundus who sported the habits of an archbishop and &quot;seduced the still recently converted wild peoples through incorrect education in our faith&quot;. On Osmundus&#x27; insistence, Emund turned the envoys away from an assembly. However, the Swedish magnate Stenkil, a relation of the king, escorted the delegation on its way back.

==Time of calamities==

Some time after the schism, King Emund dispatched his son Anund with an army &quot;in order to expand the realm&quot;. The Viking expedition crossed the sea and came, according to Adam, to Terra Feminarum, the Land of Women. Adam places this somewhere in Scythia. Modern scholars have assumed that the term alludes to Kvenland which was probably situated to the east of the Gulf of Bothnia in present-day Finland (&quot;Kven&quot; could have been mixed up with the Nordic word &quot;kvinna&quot;, woman). &quot;The women&quot;, says Adam, &quot;immediately mixed poison in the springwater, and in that way brought death to the king himself and his army.&quot; The passage implies that Anund bore the title of king together with his father.

The military disaster was paired with a severe drought and failed harvests. This crop failure can be dated to 1056 from other sources. Allegedly, the calamities caused the Swedes to turn to the Archbishop of Bremen and ask to receive Adalvard back as Bremen-appointed bishop. Adalvard duly arrived to Sweden where he devoted his efforts to the conversion of Värmland towards the border of Norway. Osmundus appears to have submitted to Adalvard in the end, but left Sweden for England some time before 1066. It has been assumed on very loose grounds that he was the same person as Åsmund Kåresson, a prominent carver of runic inscriptions in Uppland. One of the latter&#x27;s inscriptions includes the passage &quot;Åsmund Kåresson carved runes right. Then sat Emund&quot;. There has been much speculation that this refers to Emund sitting on the throne.

==Delimitation of the border==

Little is known about the relationship between Sweden and its Nordic neighbours in King Emund&#x27;s time. He may have continued his brother Anund Jacob&#x27;s support for the Danish king Sweyn Estridsen against Harald Hardrada of Norway. A memorandum about an early delimitation of the Swedish-Danish border has been preserved in a large number of medieval Swedish manuscripts. The text states that &quot;Emund Slemme was the King in Uppsala, and Sweyn Forkbeard in Denmark. They placed boundary-marks between Sweden [Sueriki] and Denmark. Now is enumerated Ragnvalde of Tiundaland, Botvid of Hälsingland, Bote of Fjärdhundraland, Grimalde of Östergötland, Tole and Tote and Tokke of Jutland, Gunkil of Sjaelland, Dan of Scania, Grimulf of Grimeton in Halland. They placed six stones between the two kingdoms. The first stone stands in Snutruase, the second in Danabäck, the third one is Kinna sten, the fourth in Uraksnaes, the fifth Vita sten, the sixth is Brömse sten between Blekinge and Möre.&quot; The memorandum is followed by a story about a meeting between the three Nordic kings on Danaholmen where the Danish king held the bridle of the Swedish king&#x27;s horse, while the Norwegian king held his stirrups, thus seemingly acknowledging the precedence of the Uppsala king.

In older historiography it was usually assumed that the province of Blekinge was transferred from Sweden to Denmark at this occasion. A late 9th-century source alleges that Blekinge belonged to the Swedes at that time, while medieval sources make clear that it belonged to Denmark. Modern scholarship has questioned this, since there is even doubt if Blekinge was considered Danish in the 1060s. Moreover, the veracity of the memorandum has been put into doubt by Peter Sawyer on various grounds. Emund the Old and Sweyn Forkbeard were not contemporaries (though the king at the time was another Sweyn, Sweyn Estridsen [1047-1074]), and some particularities might fit High medieval conditions better. According to Sawyer the memorandum may have been authored by Danish people in the first half of the 13th century, in order to prove the early origins of the Danish claims to Halland and Blekinge. Some other historians have nevertheless defended the genuine character of the text and dated it to c. 1050.

==Family and succession==

Emund&#x27;s wife is not explicitly mentioned in the sources. Through a combination of information from the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and Adam of Bremen, it has sometimes been assumed that he was married to Astrid Njalsdotter of Skjalgaätten (d. 1060). Astrid was the daughter of Norwegian nobleman Nial Finnsson (d. 1011), son of Gunhild Halvdansdotter of the Skjalga family in Hålogaland, Norway. Emund sired two known children with his consort: Anund who died before his father, and a daughter, whose name is not known but who was the Queen Consort of King Stenkil of Sweden and the mother of two more Swedish kings, Inge I and Halsten.

The cognomen &quot;Gamle&quot; is known from Adam of Bremen, although he mistakes it as a proper name and mentions in one episode a &quot;King Gamle&quot; when it is in fact Emund. The name means &quot;old&quot; and could signify that he was old when he became king or that he was the older brother to his predecessor Anund Jakob. Emund was the last king of the ancient royal house of the Swedes (sometimes known in modern history writing as the House of Munsö). He is known to have been alive as late as the summer of 1060, and probably died shortly after. Adam of Bremen relates in his work that Emund was succeeded by his &quot;nephew or stepson&quot;, in fact probably son-in law, Stenkil. With him began a new dynasty that would last until the 1120s.

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; (13th century) says that Emund was king only a short time:

<text>Chignal Smealy is a small village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Chignall, on the north-western outskirts of Chelmsford, in the Chelmsford district, in the county of Essex, England. The local church (St. Nicholas) is a red brick building, containing an unusual red brick baptismal font which has been used for many christenings. In 1881 the parish had a population of 134. On 24 March 1888 the parish was abolished to form Chignall.

The village was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

The spelling of the village name is open to discussion. Sometimes it is spelt &quot;Chignall Smealy&quot; other times, it is spelt &quot;Chignal Smealy&quot;.

==The Queen&#x27;s Birthday Flypast==
The open views from the village give an opportunity to watch the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Flypast in June each year. The route is classified but in previous years the flight has been routed over the village then on to Hainault Country Park, Fairlop station and finally to the Mall. A flypast 14 miles long passed overhead at a speed of 310 mph, concluded by Concorde escorted by the Red Arrows.

==The Village==
Chignall Smealy has a number of different clubs and groups including: Bowls Club, Chignal 4 Art, Cricket Club, Gardening Club, Wine Discovery, Women&#x27;s Institute.

The Pig and Whistle is a traditional rural village pub, dating back to the mid-19th century

To supply its mills, Nucor uses electric arc furnaces and continuous casting to melt scrap steel as opposed to blast furnaces to melt iron. In 2024, the company produced and sold approximately 18.5 million tons of steel and recycled 18 million tons of scrap.

None of Nucor&#x27;s mills are unionized and the corporate culture is opposed to trade unions.

==History==
After REO Motor Car Company, founded by Ransom E. Olds, sold its operations and initiated liquidation proceedings, a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955 and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. 

The company was renamed &quot;Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.&quot; and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. The organization&#x27;s attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s by attempting to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including the Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft was founded by Sanborn Chase, who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase&#x27;s widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. In March 1965, the company again filed for bankruptcy. Iverson, head of the only profitable division, took over as head of the company due to lack of interest in the job from others.

Iverson reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated.

In 1966, the company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant in South Carolina.

In 1968, unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson, a metallurgist by training, extended Nucor vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina.

The company purchased an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a $6 million loan secured by all of the company&#x27;s assets. Production delays and staffing problems resulted in losses, but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.

In 1972, the company, recognizing that it was now misnamed, adopted its current title, Nucor Corporation. That year, it became a public company via an initial public offering.

In 1988, the company opened its building products division.

In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, the first mini mill in the world to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.

In March 2000, a joint venture, owned 47.5% by Nucor, 47.5% by BlueScope, and 5% by IHI Corporation was formed to license Castrip technology. This technology allowed for continuous casting of sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers.

===Environmental issues===
In 2000, Nucor agreed to spend $98 million, including $85 million for new air pollution control equipment, $4 million to monitor and reduce pollution in communities near its plants, and a $9 million civil fine to resolve allegations by the United States Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The settlement was &quot;the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer.&quot;

In 2016, the company unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit to block the Environmental Protection Agency from adopting a plan to control visible pollution in Arkansas.

In 2023, the company signed an agreement with ExxonMobil for carbon capture and storage of up to 800,000 metric tons from its direct reduced iron plant in Convent, Louisiana. The plant had been criticized for its emissions.

<doc id="904297" wikidata="Q492653" url="?curid=904297" title="Casa Loma Orchestra">
<text>The Casa Loma Orchestra was an American dance band active from 1929 to 1963. Until the rapid multiplication in the number of swing bands from 1935 on, the Casa Loma Orchestra was one of the top North American dance bands. With the decline of the big band business following the end of World War II, it disbanded in 1947. However, from 1957 to 1963, it re-emerged as a recording session band in Hollywood, made up of top-flight studio musicians under the direction of its most notable leader of the past, Glen Gray. The reconstituted band made a limited number of appearances live and on television and recorded fifteen LP albums for Capitol Records before Gray died in 1963.

The band recorded and released the original version of the jazz and big band standard &quot;Sunrise Serenade&quot; in 1938 with Frankie Carle on piano.

==History==
The band assembled in 1927 as the Orange Blossoms, one of several Detroit groups that came out of the Jean Goldkette office. The band adopted the name &quot;Casa Loma&quot; by the time of its first recordings in 1929, shortly after it played an eight-month engagement at Casa Loma in Toronto, which was being operated as a hotel at the time. The band never played at Casa Loma under that name, still appearing as the Orange Blossoms at that time.

In 1930, the Casa Loma Orchestra was incorporated in New York with the members becoming owners, shareholders, and board members. The band members were hired on the grounds of &quot;musical and congenial&quot; competence and followed strict conduct and financial rules. Because the band operated as a collective group, as opposed to almost all other bands that had a &quot;leader&quot; for whom everyone worked, the band maintained a stable collection of personnel that varied little. Members who broke the rules could be summoned before the &quot;board&quot;, have their contract bought out, and be ejected from the band.

The band was led for the first few years by violinist Hank Biagini, although the eventual leader, saxophonist Glen Gray (1900 – 1963) was from the beginning &quot;first among equals.&quot; The complex arrangements called for talented musicians such as trombonist Pee Wee Hunt, guitarist S. Jack Blanchette, trumpeter Frank L. Ryerson, trumpeter Sonny Dunham, clarinetist Clarence Hutchenrider, drummer Tony Briglia and singer Kenny Sargent. Arrangements were by Gene Gifford, who also composed much of the band&#x27;s book, Spud Murphy, Larry Wagner, Salvador &quot;Tutti&quot; Camarata and Horace Henderson. Gifford&#x27;s arrangements were credited in large part to giving the band its sound, but even he fell victim to the band&#x27;s strict rules, being bought out in 1935 due to alcohol-related infractions.

The band&#x27;s manager, Cork O&#x27;Keefe, was made a vice president in the corporation and arranged bookings in venues such as Glen Island casino, which they helped popularize, and the Essex House Hotel, that led to their increasing fame via radio broadcasts before and throughout the swing era of 1935–1946.

In 1943, Eugenie Baird became &quot;the first girl vocalist ever featured&quot; with the Casa Loma Orchestra.

In 2019, the Casa Loma Symphony Orchestra was incorporated and became the new orchestra in residence at Casa Loma in Toronto, led by Catriona Delaney and Paolo Busato and conducted by Maestro Paolo Busato, wholly inspired by the history of this group.

==Radio==
Their mid-1930s appearances on the long-run radio comedy-variety program, the &quot;Camel Caravan&quot; (introduced with their theme, &quot;Smoke Rings&quot;) increased their popularity. Gray chose not to conduct the band in the early years, playing in the saxophone section while violinist Mel Jenssen acted as conductor. In 1937, the band overwhelmingly voted in favor of Glen leading the orchestra, and Gray finally accepted the job.

Hits included &quot;Casa Loma Stomp,&quot; &quot;No Name Jive&quot; and &quot;Maniac&#x27;s Ball&quot;. Part of the reason for the band&#x27;s decline is that other big bands included in their books hard-swinging numbers emulating the hot Casa Loma style. In the late 1930s Gray took top billing, and by the mid-1940s (as the other original players left) Gray would come to own the band and the Casa Loma name. For a time, during this period, the band featured guitarist Herb Ellis, trumpeter Bobby Hackett, pianist Nick Denucci and cornetist Red Nichols. By 1950, the Casa Loma band had ceased touring, Gray retired to Massachusetts, and the later recordings on Capitol (beginning with &quot;Casa Loma in Hi-Fi&quot; in 1956 and continuing through the &quot;Sounds of the Great Bands&quot; series) were done by studio musicians in Hollywood (with several of Gray&#x27;s &quot;alumni&quot; occasionally featured).

==Recordings==
In October 1929, the band debuted on Okeh Records. The following year, they signed with Brunswick where they recorded until 1934. They briefly recorded for Victor in 1933 as &quot;Glen Gray and his Orchestra&quot;, the Casa Loma name being under contract to Brunswick. In late 1934, they followed Jack Kapp to the newly formed Decca Records and stayed there well into the LP era when they signed with Capitol. Most of the Okeh&#x27;s and many of the Brunswick&#x27;s were out-and-out jazz (albeit very rehearsed) and remain highly collectible.

==Film==
In 1942, the orchestra made a Warner Bros. short film, &quot;Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra&quot;, that featured the songs &quot;Hep and Happy,&quot; &quot;Purple Moonlight,&quot; &quot;Broom Street&quot; and &quot;Darktown Strutters Ball.&quot;

Universal Studios produced a short subject, &quot;Smoke Rings&quot; ( – via YouTube), that featured the Casa Loma Orchestra. Released July 28, 1943, the film featured Eugenie Baird, Pee Wee Hunt, and The Pied Pipers. It included the songs &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Stuff in Your Cuff,&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s My Affair&quot; and &quot;Little Man with the Hammer.&quot; The band also appeared in &quot;Jam Session&quot; (1944), where they played their famous &quot;No Name Jive.&quot;

The orchestra&#x27;s 1937 recording &quot;Girl of My Dreams&quot; was presented in the 1987 film &quot;Angel Heart&quot; with the fictional title &quot;Life Would Be Complete&quot; by the fictional crooner Johnny Favorite, and elements of the tune were incorporated into the score.

<text>Juan Díaz Canales is a Spanish comics artist and an animated film director, known as the co-creator of &quot;Blacksad&quot;.

==Biography==
At an early age, Juan Díaz Canales became interested in comics and their creation, which progressed and broadened out to include animated films. At the age of 18, he entered a school for animation. In 1996 he founded, together with three other artists, a company called Tridente Animation. Through this, he has worked with European and American companies, providing plots and scripts for comics and animation films, as well as directing animated television series and animation movies.

During this period he met Juanjo Guarnido, with whom Canales decided to create comics based around a private investigator, Blacksad. After contacting several editors, Guarnido and Canales finally signed on with French publisher Dargaud, and in November 2000, &quot;Quelque part entre les ombres (Somewhere within the Shadows)&quot; was published. It was a great success with both critics and the public, and was awarded the Prix de la Découverte at the Sierre International Comics Festival and the &quot;Avenir&quot; Prize at the Lys-lez-Lannoy Festival, in Switzerland and France respectively. In March 2003 the second album &quot;Arctic-Nation&quot;, was released. It was once again a great success, winning the Angoulême Audience Award and the Festival Prize for Artwork in 2004. The third instalment of the &quot;Blacksad&quot; series, &quot;Âme Rouge (Red Soul)&quot;, was published in 2005. In 2006 it was awarded the Angoulême Prize for a Series.

In 2015, he and artist Rubén Pellejero were chosen by Patrizia Zanotti, in charge of the copyrights to Hugo Pratt&#x27;s &quot;Corto Maltese&quot; series, to publish a new album.

<doc id="904304" wikidata="Q707498" url="?curid=904304" title="Moses Sofer">
<text>Moses Schreiber (1762–1839), known to his own community and Jewish posterity in the Hebrew translation as Moshe Sofer, also known by his main work Chatam Sofer, Chasam Sofer, or Hatam Sofer (trans. &quot;Seal of the Scribe&quot;, and acronym for ChiddusheiToirasMoisheSofer), was one of the leading Orthodox rabbis of European Jewry in the first half of the nineteenth century.

He was a teacher to thousands and a powerful opponent of the Reform movement in Judaism, which was attracting many Jews in the Austrian Empire, and beyond. As Rav of the city of Pressburg, he advocated for strong communal life, first-class education, and uncompromising opposition to Reform and radical change.

Sofer established a yeshiva in Pozsony (&quot;Pressburg&quot; in German; today &quot;Bratislava&quot;, Slovakia), the Pressburg Yeshiva, which became the most influential yeshiva in Central Europe, producing hundreds of future leaders of Hungarian Jewry. This yeshiva continued to function until World War II; afterward, it was relocated to Jerusalem, under the leadership of the Chasam Sofer&#x27;s great-grandson, Rabbi Akiva Sofer (the &quot;Daas Sofer&quot;).

Sofer published very little during his lifetime; however, his post-humously published works include more than a thousand responsa, novellae on the Talmud, sermons, biblical and liturgical commentaries, and religious poetry. He is an authority who is quoted extensively in Orthodox Jewish scholarship. Many of his responsa are required reading for semicha (rabbinic ordination) candidates. His &quot;chiddushim&quot; (original Torah insights) sparked a new style in rabbinic commentary, and some editions of the Talmud contain his emendations and additions.

==Early years==
Sofer was born in Frankfurt am Main on September 24, 1762.
His father&#x27;s name was Shmuel and his mother&#x27;s was Reizel, the daughter of Elchanan. Shmuel&#x27;s mother, Reizchen was a daughter of the &quot;Gaon&quot; of Frankfurt, Shmuel Schotten.

==Education==
At the age of nine, Sofer entered the yeshiva of Rabbi Nathan Adler at Frankfurt, a kabbalist known for its strict and unusual ritual practices. He was a pupil of Pinchas Horowitz of Frankfurt for one year, leaving in 1776 for the yeshiva of another rabbi, David Tebele Scheuer, in the neighboring city of Mainz where he studied in 1776 and 1777, then returned to his native city.

==First positions and marriage==
In 1782 Nathan Adler became rabbi of Boskovice, Moravia, and on Adler&#x27;s advice Sofer went to Prostějov, Moravia.

There, on 6 May 1787, Sofer married Sarah, the daughter of Moses Jerwitz, the rabbi of Prostějov. Sofer became a member of the Chevra Kadisha, and eventually became head of the yeshiva in Prostějov.

In 1794 Sofer became rabbi of Strážnice after he had received government permission to settle there. In 1797, he became rabbi of Mattersdorf, one of the seven communities (known as the Siebengemeinden, or &quot;Sheva Kehillot&quot;) of Burgenland, where he established a yeshiva. His pupils there included Meir Ash, the rabbi of Uzhhorod.

==Pressburg (Bratislava)==
Sofer declined many offers for the rabbinate, but in 1806, he accepted a call to Pressburg (&quot;Pozsony&quot; in Hungarian; today Bratislava, capital of Slovakia). There, he established a yeshiva, which was attended by as many as 500 pupils. Hundreds of these pupils became the rabbis of Hungarian Jewry. Among them were:
For a short period of time during the Napoleonic War in Pressburg in 1809, Moses Schreiber retreated to a small vineyard town, Svätý Jur, where he organised a charity for his fellow citizens affected by the war.

==Second marriage and children==
Sofer&#x27;s first wife Sarah died childless on 22 July 1812.

In 1813 &quot;(23 Cheshvan 5573)&quot;, he married for the second time, to Sarel (Sarah) (1790–1832, d. &quot;18 Adar II 5592&quot;), the widowed daughter of Rabbi Akiva Eiger, Rav of Poznań. She was the widow of Rabbi Avraham Moshe Kalischer (1788–1812), Rabbi of Piła, the son of Rabbi Yehuda Kalischer, author of &quot;Hayod Hachazoka&quot;.

With his second wife, Sofer had three sons and eight daughters. All three of his sons became rabbis: Avrohom Shmuel Binyamin Sofer (known as the &quot;Ktav Sofer&quot; or &quot;Ksav Sofer&quot;); Shimon Sofer (known as the &quot;Michtav Sofer&quot;), who became the Rav of Kraków; and Yozef Yozpa Sofer.

Sofer&#x27;s descendants named their works after the Hebrew translation of &quot;Schreiber&quot; (scribe), Sofer&#x27;s civil surname, along the lines of Sofer&#x27;s work &quot;Chasam Sofer&quot;; as, for instance, &quot;Michtav Sofer&quot; (son), &quot;Ktav Sofer&quot; (son), the &quot;Shevet Sofer&quot; (grandson), the Chasan Sofer (grandson), the &quot;Yad Sofer&quot; (great-grandson), the &quot;Daas Sofer&quot; (great-grandson), the &quot;Cheshev Sofer&quot;, and &quot;Imrei Sofer&quot; (2x great-grandson).

Sofer and his family lived at the end of Zamocka Street, where the Hotel Ibis is now located.

==Influence against changes in Judaism==

Sofer led the community of Pressburg for 33 years, until his death in 1839. It was his influence and determination that kept the Reform movement out of the city.
From the late 18th century onwards, movements which eventually developed into Reform Judaism began to develop. Synagogues subscribing to these new views began to appear in centres such as Berlin and Hamburg. Sofer was profoundly opposed to the reformers, and attacked them in his speeches and writings. For example, in a &quot;responsum&quot; of 1816, he forbade the congregation in Vienna to allow a performance in the synagogue of a cantata they had commissioned from the composer Ignaz Moscheles, because it would involve a mixed choir. In the same spirit, he contested the founders of the &quot;Reformschule&quot; (Reform synagogue) in Pozsony, which was established in the year 1827.

For Sofer, Judaism as previously practiced was the only form of Judaism acceptable. In his view, the rules and tenets of Judaism had never changed — and cannot ever change. This became the defining idea for the opponents to Reform, and in some form, it has continued to influence the Orthodox response to innovation in Jewish doctrine and practice.

Sofer applied a pun to the Talmudic term chadash asur min haTorah, &quot;&#x27;new&#x27; is forbidden by the Torah&quot; (referring literally to eating &quot;chadash&quot;, &quot;new grain&quot;, before the Omer offering is given) as a slogan heralding his opposition to any philosophical, social or practical change to customary Orthodox practice. He did not allow the addition of any secular studies to the curriculum of his Pressburg Yeshiva.

===Universal Israelite Congress===
The Universal Israelite Congress of 1868-69 in Pest was influential in affecting the direction of Judaism in Europe. To try to unify all streams of Judaism under one constitution, the Orthodox offered the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; and surrounding codes as the ruling code of law and observance. The reformists dismissed this notation and in response, many Orthodox rabbis resigned from the Congress to form their own social and political groups. Hungarian Jewry split into two major institutionally sectarian groups, Orthodox and Neolog. Some communities refused to join either of the groups and called themselves Status Quo.

==Actions of students and descendants==

Sofer&#x27;s most notable student, Rabbi Moshe Schick, together with Sofer&#x27;s sons, the rabbis Shmuel Binyamin and Shimon, took an active role in arguing against the Reform movement. They showed relative tolerance for heterogeneity within the Orthodox camp. Others, such as the more zealous Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein, supported a more stringent position in orthodoxy.

In 1877, Rabbi Moshe Schick demonstrated support for the separatist policies of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in Germany. His son studied at the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary, which taught secular studies and was headed by Azriel Hildesheimer. Hirsch, however, did not reciprocate. He was surprised at what he described as Schick&#x27;s halakhic contortions in condemning even those &quot;status quo&quot; communities that clearly adhered to halakhah. Hillel Lichtenstein opposed Hildesheimer and his son Hirsh in their speaking German to give sermons and their tending toward Modern Zionism.

In 1871, Shimon Sofer, Chief Rabbi of Kraków, founded the Machzikei Hadas organisation with the Hasidic Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach of Belz. This was the first effort of Haredi Jews in Europe to create a political party; it was part of the developing identification of the traditional Orthodoxy as a self-defined group. Rabbi Shimon was nominated as a candidate to the Polish Regional Parliament, under the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph. He was elected to the &quot;Polish Club&quot;, in which he took an active part until his death.

Another notable group is Satmar, which was founded by Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel), who was a Hasid who paid homage to the Chasam Sofer and had similar views to that of Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein. His descendant Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum headed the Edah HaChareidis for many years, living in Israel and later in the United States, where he influenced Orthodox Jewry.

Starting in 1830, about twenty disciples of Sofer settled in Palestine, almost all of them in Jerusalem. They joined the Old Yishuv, which comprised the Musta&#x27;arabim, Sephardim, and Ashkenazim. They also settled in Safed, Tiberias, and Hebron. Together with the Perushim and Hasidim, they formed an approach to Judaism reflecting those of their European counterparts.

Notable disciples of the Pressburg Yeshiva who had major influence on mainstream Orthodoxy in Palestine were Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld (student of Ktav Sofer) and Rabbi Yitzchok Yerucham Diskin (son of Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, from Brisk, Lithuania), who, together, in 1919, founded the Edah HaChareidis in then-Mandate Palestine.

In 1932, Sonnenfeld was succeeded by Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, a disciple of the Shevet Sofer, one of Sofer&#x27;s grandchildren. Dushinsky founded the Dushinsky Hasidic dynasty in Israel, based on Sofer&#x27;s teachings.

==Death and burial place==

Sofer died in Pressburg on 3 October 1839 (&quot;25 Tishrei 5600&quot;).

Today, a modern Jewish memorial, containing Sofer&#x27;s grave and those of many of his associates and family, is located in Bratislava. It is situated underground below Bratislava Castle, on the left bank of the Danube. The nearby tram and bus stop is named after him.

The preservation of these graves has a curious history. The Jewish cemetery in Bratislava was confiscated during the regime in 1943, to build a roadway. Negotiations with the regime enabled the community to preserve the section of the cemetery including Sofer&#x27;s grave, enclosed in concrete, below the surface of the new road. The regime complied, possibly as a consequence of a large bribe (according to one story), foreign pressure (according to another story), or for fear of a curse if the graves were destroyed (according to yet another story).

Following the declaration of independence by Slovakia in 1992, new negotiations were undertaken to restore public access to the preserved graves. In the mid-1990s, the International Committee for Preservation of Gravesites of Geonai Pressburg was formed, to support and oversee relocation of tram tracks and building of a mausoleum. Construction of the mausoleum was completed after overcoming numerous technical and religious issues, and opened on 8 July 2002. Access to the mausoleum can be arranged through the local Jewish community organisation.

==Legacy==
Many synagogues and yeshivas worldwide bear the name and follow the legacy of the Chatam Sofer.

===Erlau yeshiva and community===

The most notable recent living descendant and heir to the Sofer legacy was Rabbi Yochanan Sofer. Yochanan was a direct descendant and fifth generation to the Chatam Sofer. He was the leader of the Erlau movement, whose progenitor was his grandfather, Rabbi Shimon Sofer of Erlau, a grandson of the Chatam Sofer, and son of the Ktav Sofer.

Yochanan&#x27;s father, Rabbi Moshe Sofer (II) (Dayan of Erlau), and grandfather, Rabbi Shimon (Av Beth Din of Erlau), perished in the Holocaust, together with most of their families. After the Holocaust, Rabbi Yochanan re-founded the Chasam Sofer Yeshiva in Pest, together with Rabbi Moshe Stern (the Debretziner Rav) and his brother, Avraham Shmuel Binyamin (II). He then returned to Eger (Erlau) to re-establish his grandfather&#x27;s Yeshiva.

In 1950, he immigrated to Israel, together with his students, and, for a short while, merged his yeshiva with the Pressburg Yeshiva of Rabbi Akiva Sofer (&quot;Daas Sofer&quot;). In 1953, he founded his own Yeshiva in Katamon, Jerusalem, as well as the &quot;Institute for Research of the Teachings of the Chasam Sofer&quot;. The Institute researches and deciphers hand-written documents penned by the Chasam Sofer, his pupils, and descendants, and has printed hundreds of sefarim.

Over the years, Rabbi Yochanan founded many synagogues, chederim, and kollelim, which he named after his ancestors. The Ezrat Torah Campus in Jerusalem is named &quot;Beth Chasam Sofer&quot;, as is the Erlau Synagogue in Haifa. The chederim are named &quot;Talmud Torah Ksav Sofer&quot;, after the Chasam Sofer&#x27;s son; the kollelim and synagogues are named &quot;Yad Sofer&quot;, after Rabbi Yochanan&#x27;s father; and the main yeshiva campus in Katamon is named &quot;Ohel Shimon MiErlau&quot;, after his grandfather. He has authored numerous Torah commentary works, naming them &quot;Imrei Sofer&quot;.

The Erlau community is considered Hasidic style, though strictly follows Ashkenaz customs, as did the Chasam Sofer. It has branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Beitar Illit, El&#x27;ad, Haifa, Ashdod, and Boro Park (New York).

===The Pressburg Yeshiva of Jerusalem===
The Pressburg Yeshiva of Jerusalem () is a leading yeshiva located in the Givat Shaul neighborhood of Jerusalem, Israel. It was founded in 1950 by Rabbi Akiva Sofer (known as the &quot;Daas Sofer&quot;), a great-grandson of Rabbi Moses Sofer (the &quot;Chasam Sofer&quot;), who established the original Pressburg Yeshiva in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1807. , the rosh yeshiva is Rabbi Simcha Bunim Sofer.

The yeshiva building includes a Yeshiva Ketana, Yeshiva Gedolah, and kollel.

The main beis medrash doubles as a synagogue where some neighborhood residents also pray on Shabbat. The complex also includes a general neighborhood synagogue which functions as Givat Shaul&#x27;s main nusach Ashkenaz synagogue.

===Chasan Sofer Yeshiva, New York===
The Chassan Sofer Yeshiva in New York is considered the American yeshiva of the Chasam Sofer legacy. It was founded by Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, who was born and raised in Mattersdorf, Austria. His father, Simcha Bunim Ehrenfeld, the rabbi of Mattersdorf, whose father, Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld (the Chasan Sofer), was a grandson of the Chasam Sofer.

Rabbi Shmuel was rabbi of Mattersdorf from 1926 until 1938, when the congregation was dispersed by the Nazis. He escaped to America, and immediately re-established the Chasan Sofer Yeshiva in the Lower East Side, from where it was later relocated to Boro Park. After his death, he was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Ehrenfeld.

The yeshiva currently enrolls over 400 students in kindergarten through twelfth grade, and operates a Head Start Program and rabbinical seminary.

===Chug Chasam Sofer, Bnei Brak===
During the 1950s and 1960s, many synagogues in Israel were built by Hungarian Jewry, and named Chug Chasam Sofer. This network of synagogues were founded in Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Jerusalem, Petach Tikva, Haifa, and Netanya. These synagogues still operate, but have been integrated into the larger community, with no distinct character of their own, besides for that of Bnei Brak, founded by Rabbi Yitzchak Shlomo Ungar, and that of Petach Tikva, founded by Rabbi Shmaryahu Deutch.

Rabbi Ungar, a descendant of the Chasam Sofer, founded a yeshiva named Machneh Avraham, and a kashrut organization named Chug Chasam Sofer, which are both very active and well known. After Rabbi Ungar&#x27;s passing in 1994, the yeshiva appointed Rabbi Altman as rabbi and rosh yeshiva, with Rabbi Shmuel Eliezer Stern remaining the head of the kashrut organization.

===Pressburg Institutions of London===
The Pressburg institutions in London, England, are headed by a descendant of the Chasam Sofer, Rabbi Shmuel Ludmir (who has published some of his work).

===Dushinsky, Jerusalem===
The Dushinsky community considers itself a continuation of the Chasam Sofer dynasty – not by genealogy, but, rather, by school of thought.

The founder of the Dushinsky dynasty was Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky (1865–1948), who was a disciple of Rabbi Simcha Bunim Sofer (the &quot;Shevet Sofer&quot;), the son of the Ksav Sofer at the Pressburg Yeshiva. The Dushinsky dynasty has been more integrated into the Hasidic community, with many of their customs derived from Nusach Sefard, but still remains true to the teachings of the Chasam Sofer. This is mainly due to Rabbi Yosef Tzvi&#x27;s appointment as Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis, and the Dushinsky alignment with the teachings of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum of Satmar.

<text>Maven Huffman (born November 26, 1976) is an American professional wrestler and YouTuber. He is best known for his time with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under his first name, where he is known for co-winning the inaugural season of Tough Enough alongside Nidia Guenard. He also became a three-time WWE Hardcore Champion.

==Early life==
Maven Huffman was born on November 26, 1976, in Tennessee but raised in Crimora, Virginia. After his father left the family, his mother committed suicide the day after Christmas in 1978 when he was only 2 years old. He was adopted by his maternal uncle and his aunt, who began rearing him at 2 years old. His aunt died from cancer in 2004. Huffman graduated from Wilson Memorial High School in Fishersville, Virginia before attending Eastern Mennonite University.

In 1999, he moved to Portland, Oregon, where he began playing baseball for the Aloha Knights team. Prior to becoming a professional wrestler, Huffman was a middle school teacher at Twality Middle School in Tigard, Oregon for two years.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2005)===
====Tough Enough and Hardcore Champion (2001–2002)====
Huffman began his professional wrestling career in 2001 upon being selected to participate in the inaugural season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, a reality television show used by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to find new WWF stars. Ultimately, Maven would become the co-winner of the competition alongside Nidia Guenard, and he was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) to receive further training.

On the October 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Maven made his in-ring debut against Tazz, one of his &quot;Tough Enough&quot; trainers, who forced him to submit to the &quot;Tazzmission&quot;. Following the match, Tazz helped Maven to his feet before clotheslining him, thus starting a feud between the two. After losing to Tazz via submission in a rematch the following week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Maven clotheslined Tazz following the match. On the October 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Maven won his first wrestling match as he defeated Tazz with assistance from &quot;Tough Enough&quot; co-winner Nidia Guenard. Following this brief feud, Maven began a feud with The Undertaker after he eliminated The Undertaker from the 2002 Royal Rumble by dropkicking him from behind; The Undertaker responded in turn by returning to the ring, eliminating Maven. He proceeded to hit him with a steel chair, and beating him all the way back to the concession stand area.

On the January 28, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Maven was awarded a title bout by WWF co-owner Ric Flair against Chris Jericho for the Undisputed WWF Championship by virtue of never actually being eliminated from the Royal Rumble, but lost after submitting to the &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot;. After the match, Maven was attacked by The Undertaker. On the February 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Maven faced The Undertaker for his WWF Hardcore Championship, and after interference from The Rock and his &quot;Tough Enough&quot; trainer Al Snow, Maven defeated The Undertaker to win the Hardcore Championship, the first championship of his career. Their feud ended after The Undertaker defeated Maven and Al Snow in a 2-on-1 handicap match when The Undertaker made Maven submit to the Dragon Sleeper. At WrestleMania X8, Maven lost the Hardcore Championship to Spike Dudley during a match with Goldust due to the title&#x27;s unique 24/7 rule, but won the title back the same night from Christian due to the same rule. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Maven was attacked by a debuting Brock Lesnar during his Hardcore Championship defense against Al Snow and Spike Dudley. Maven was the tenth pick for the SmackDown! brand in the WWF draft and subsequently brought the Hardcore Championship to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but he was punished by Vince McMahon after he lost the title to Raw superstar Raven on the March 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Maven was traded to the Raw brand on November 4, 2002, where he confronted Christopher Nowinski with his former trainer Al Snow.
====Various feuds and departure (2003–2005)====
Maven entered the 2003 Royal Rumble. He attempted to eliminate The Undertaker by using a dropkick like he did the previous year, but failed and was eliminated by The Undertaker. Maven fought World Heavyweight Champion Triple H on the March 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but lost. In 2004, Maven received the biggest push in his career, even gaining a victory over then-Evolution member Batista. Maven then took part in an Elimination Match at Survivor Series, teaming with Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, and Chris Jericho to face Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky, and Edge for the power to control Raw for one month. Maven was attacked backstage by Snitsky prior to the match, but after Benoit was eliminated, Maven arrived to join his teammates. He was eventually eliminated by Triple H. Orton was the sole survivor and as a result, he and his team had control of &quot;Raw&quot; for one month.

Maven was the first to control &quot;Raw&quot;, booking himself in a World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H on the November 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, who tried to get out of it by offering Maven a place in Evolution. He declined, but despite interference from Jericho, Benoit, and Orton, Triple H retained the title due to interference from Snitsky and Ric Flair.

On the November 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Maven competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated by Eugene. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Maven faced Eugene in a singles match, which he lost by disqualification after attacking Eugene&#x27;s injured knee during the match before choking him out. After the match, Maven attacked Eugene&#x27;s tag team partner William Regal as Regal came to help him, thus turning heel in the process.

Following this, Maven began feuding with Shelton Benjamin over Benjamin&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship, culminating at New Year&#x27;s Revolution in a singles match for the title. Before the start of the match, Maven proceeded to blast the Puerto Rican crowd before Benjamin quickly defeated him in just a matter of minutes by using a roll-up. Maven then cut a promo on Benjamin, stating that the match &quot;didn&#x27;t count&quot;, and challenged him to a re-match. Benjamin accepted, and Maven was defeated in only seconds yet again following the &quot;T-Bone Suplex&quot;.

Following his feud with Benjamin, Maven formed a tag team with Simon Dean, where he acted as a dedicated user of Dean&#x27;s &quot;Simon System&quot; brand of nutritional products. After beating jobbers for a month, at Backlash, Maven and Simon Dean competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship which was won by The Hurricane and Rosey. The team came to an end when Dean was traded to the SmackDown! brand, while Maven was subsequently released by WWE on July 5, 2005. According to Huffman, Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis explained he was let go for not having progressed to the level the company was expecting, especially after having been advised to put more focus on honing his ring-work prior to shows.

In October 2023 in his YouTube video, Huffman revealed that Laurinaitis had offered him to return to WWE in 2008, saying that Huffman had been gone long enough and he will not be known as the &quot;Tough Enough kid&quot; anymore if he returned. Huffman declined due to the guaranteed money he was making in his Home Shopping Network role, a decision he said he regretted. In a December video, Huffman revealed that WWE was ready to offer him to be trained as an announcer at the WWE Performance Center in 2020. The deal fell through as his interview with WWE was on March 11, 2020, the day when the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 became a pandemic.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling/United Wrestling Federation (2006–2007)===
After WWE and working in the independent circuit Maven joined United Wrestling Federation Live on February 10, 2006 and teamed alongside Jeff Jarrett to defeat Team 3D. On March 31, 2006, Maven wrestled his first match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he and Jarrett lost to Jeff Hardy and Kip James in a tag team match. After wrestling sporadically for the UWF and on house shows for TNA throughout the year, Maven wrestled his final match on October 5, 2007, where he lost to Test in a match for Full Throttle Wrestling.

=== Independent circuit (2015–present) ===
On July 11, 2015, Maven announced his return to pro wrestling. His return match took place at Brian Myers&#x27; Create A Pro Wrestling Academy in Long Island, New York on July 19, 2015. Maven teamed with Johnny Clash to defeat The Warren Cousins (Mikey Warren and TJ Warren) in his first match since 2007.

On September 26, 2015, Maven teamed with Brian Myers in a losing effort against The Cam-An Connection (Anthony Greene and Cam Zagami).

On April 16, 2016, Maven teamed with Myers and Pat Buck in a six man tag team match losing to Aesthetic Males (Beefcake Charlie, Damian Gibbs and Mike Del) in a match for the WrestlePro promotion.

Maven would return to wrestling in 2021. He defeated Matt Cardona for the vacated FWF Tough Enough Trophy Street Fight title on October 9, 2022. On July 23, 2023, Maven won a 26-man battle royal for Dropkick Diabetes 7 in Youngstown, Ohio. On April 27, 2024, Maven entered Reality of Wrestling’s 30 Man Last Stand Rumble at number 21, eliminating Inferno Tiger before being eliminated by Quentin Winters in the same way that Maven eliminated The Undertaker in the 2002 Royal Rumble Match.

==Television career==
In July 2005, Huffman was featured in episode three of &quot;MTV&#x27;s The 70s House&quot; where he and other WWE wrestlers competed in a game of dodge ball.

In March 2006, it was announced by VH1 that Huffman would be a participant in &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; season 6. On the first episode, he was picked by the existing castmates as the seventh and final cast member in a &quot;15 More Minutes of Fame Reality Hunk Pageant,&quot; beating four other reality &quot;hunks&quot;, including former &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant Corey Clark.

Subsequently, Huffman was a host for a show on BET J called BET&#x27;s J List. He also appeared on the Home Shopping Network&#x27;s weekday morning show, &quot;HSN Today&quot;, as its exercise and wellness expert as well as the co-host of HSN&#x27;s NFL Pro Football Fan Shop. He was terminated from HSN after his arrest.

Maven also has a popular YouTube channel where he discusses his WWE career and offers insights into life as a WWE superstar.

== Personal life ==
According to fellow professional wrestler Konnan, Huffman is his nephew. On July 29, 2021, Maven stated during an interview with Chris Van Vliet that he’s not related to Konnan. 

On April 2, 2012, Huffman was arrested in Florida. Police revealed that he was doctor shopping due to an addiction to oxycodone and hydrocodone. He was released on a $2,000 bond and faced up to 5 years behind bars, if convicted.

<doc id="904311" wikidata="Q2517365" url="?curid=904311" title="Vernon Louis Parrington">
<text>Vernon Louis Parrington (August 3, 1871 – June 16, 1929) was an American literary historian, scholar, and college football coach. His three-volume history of American letters, &quot;Main Currents in American Thought&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1928 and was one of the most influential books for American historians of its time. Parrington taught at the College of Emporia, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Washington. He was also the head football coach at the College of Emporia from 1893 to 1896 and Oklahoma from 1897 to 1900. Parrington founded the American studies movement in 1927.

==Early life and education==
Born in Aurora, Illinois, to a Republican family that soon moved to Emporia, Kansas, Parrington attended the College of Emporia and Harvard University, receiving his B.A. from the latter institution in 1893. He did not undertake graduate study. He was appalled by the hardships of Kansas farmers in the 1890s, and began moving left. He began his career teaching English and coaching football at the College of Emporia, which awarded him a master&#x27;s degree in 1895 &quot;for work completed &#x27;in course.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==
Parrington moved to the University of Oklahoma in 1897, where he taught British literature, organized the department of English, coached the football team, played on the baseball team, edited the campus newspaper, and tried to beautify the campus. He published little and in 1908 he was fired due to pressures from religious groups who wanted all &quot;immoral faculty&quot; fired. From there he went on to a distinguished academic career at the University of Washington.

Parrington was the second head coach of Oklahoma Sooners football team and first University of Oklahoma faculty member to hold the position. He is credited with bringing a Harvard style of play and better organization to the football program. During his four-year stretch from 1897 to 1900, Parrington&#x27;s teams played only 12 games, compiling a record of 9–2–1. Parrington&#x27;s span as head football coach was the longest of any of Oklahoma&#x27;s first five coaches.

Parrington moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington in 1908. He recalled in 1918, &quot;With every passing year my radicalism draws fresh nourishment from large knowledge of the evils of private capitalism. Hatred of that selfish system is become the chief passion of my life. The change from Oklahoma to Washington marks the shift with me from the older cultural interpretation of life to the later economic.&quot;

===Founder of American Studies===
Parrington founded the interdisciplinary American studies movement with his 1927 work &quot;Main Currents in American Thought,&quot; a three-volume history of American letters from colonial times. The movement was expanded in the 1920s and 1930s by Perry Miller, F. O. Matthiessen, and Robert Spiller. The elements that these pioneers considered revolutionary were Parrington&#x27;s interdisciplinarity, consideration of cultural analysis, and a focus on the uniqueness of North America.

From the introduction to &quot;Main Currents of American Thought&quot;:

&quot;I have undertaken to give some account of the genesis and development in American letters of certain germinal ideas that have come to be reckoned traditionally American—how they came into being here, how they were opposed, and what influence they have exerted in determining the form and scope of our characteristic ideals and institutions. In pursuing such a task, I have chosen to follow the broad path of our political, economic, and social development, rather than the narrower belletristic.&quot;

===&quot;Main Currents in American Thought&quot;===
The book won the 1928 Pulitzer Prize for History. Parrington defined the three phases of U.S. history as Calvinistic pessimism, romantic optimism, and mechanistic pessimism, with democratic idealism as the main driving force.

Parrington defended the doctrine of state sovereignty, and sought to disassociate it from the cause of slavery, claiming that the association of those two causes had proven &quot;disastrous to American democracy,&quot; removing the last brake on the growth of corporate power in the Gilded Age as the federal government began shielding capitalists from local and state regulation.

For two decades &quot;Main Currents in American Thought&quot; was one of the most influential books for American historians. Reising (1989) shows the book dominated literary and cultural criticism from 1927 through the early 1950s. Crowe (1977) calls it &quot;the &quot;Summa Theologica of Progressive history.&quot; Progressive history was a set of related assumptions and attitudes, which inspired the first great flowering of professional American scholarship in history. These historians saw economic and geographical forces as primary, and saw ideas as merely instruments. They regarded many dominant concepts and interpretations as masks for deeper realities.

His progressive interpretation of American history was highly influential in the 1920s and 1930s and helped define modern liberalism in the United States. After receiving overwhelming praise and exerting enormous influence among intellectuals in the 1930s and 1940s, Parrington&#x27;s ideas fell out of fashion before 1950. Richard Hofstadter says &quot;the most striking thing about the reputation of V L Parrington, as we think of it today, is its abrupt decline...during the 1940s Parrington rather quickly cease to have a compelling interest for students of American literature, and in time historians too began to desert him.&quot; Hofstadter shows how Parrington&#x27;s ideas came under heavy assault in the 1940s and 1950s, naming Lionel Trilling as especially influential in the attack. Harold Bloom says: &quot;Parrington was, in turn, condemned to obscurity by critics like Lionel Trilling, who sharply criticized his literary nationalism and his insistence that literature should appeal to a popular constituency.&quot; Liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in his autobiography, says that the progressive histories of the 1920s such as &quot;Main Currents,&quot; &quot;are little read and their authors largely forgotten.&quot; He adds that, &quot;&quot;Main Currents&quot; impoverished the rich and complex American past. Parrington reduced Jonathan Edwards, Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Henry James to marginal figures, practitioners of belles lettres, not illuminators of the American experience.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Parrington died suddenly, on June 16, 1929, in Winchcombe, England.

Hall finds that in the 1940s and 1950s English professors dropped Parrington&#x27;s approach in favor of the &quot;New Criticism&quot; and focused on the texts themselves rather than the social, economic, and political contexts that intrigued Parrington. Meanwhile, historians shifted to a consensus model of the past that considered Parrington&#x27;s dialectical polarity between liberal and conservative to be naive. During the 1950s the book lost its popularity, and was largely ignored by scholars. While dismissing its thesis, some commentators were still captivated by Parrington&#x27;s politically committed writing style, as historian David W. Levy noted:
:Readers and scholars of the rising generation may not follow Parrington&#x27;s particular judgments or point of view, but it is hard to believe that they will not still be attracted, captivated, and inspired by his sparkle, his breadth, his daring, the ardor of his political commitment.

The Parrington Oval at the University of Oklahoma and Parrington Hall at the University of Washington are named for Parrington.

<text>The Burial Mound (&quot;Kjæmpehøjen&quot;) was Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s second play and his first play to be performed. It is a one-act verse drama, written in 1850 when Ibsen was 22 years old. The play was first performed at the Christiania Theater on 26 September 1850, under Ibsen&#x27;s pseudonym Brynjolf Bjarme.

The play was re-written in 1854 for a new performance at &quot;Det Norske Theater&quot; in Bergen, where Ibsen at the time worked as a writer, producer and director.

<text>The Wild Duck (original Norwegian title: &quot;Vildanden&quot;) is an 1884 play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. It explores the complexities of truth and illusion through the story of a family torn apart by secrets and the intrusion of an idealistic outsider. It focuses on the Ekdal family, whose fragile peace is shattered by Gregers Werle, an idealist who insists on exposing hidden truths, leading to tragic consequences. The play was written in a realistic style, but literary scholars have pointed out the play&#x27;s kinship with symbolism. It blends themes such as deception, betrayal, and the disillusionment of modern life with moments of comedy and satire, and is considered the first modern masterpiece in the genre of tragicomedy. &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; and &quot;Rosmersholm&quot; are &quot;often to be observed in the critics&#x27; estimates vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsen&#x27;s works&quot;.

Themes of visibility and recognition permeate the narrative, featuring characters struggling to be seen while metaphorically and literally blind to each other&#x27;s true selves, symbolized through motifs such as blindness, photography, and the wounded wild duck. Like other Ibsen plays, it is rich in references to Ibsen&#x27;s family, with &quot;Old Ekdal&quot; widely considered one of the most famous literary portraits of the playwright&#x27;s father Knud Ibsen. The character &quot;Gregers Werle&quot; represents the spirit of the Paus family and Upper Telemark, a broader theme that is found in many of Ibsen&#x27;s plays.

==Plot==

The first act opens with a dinner party hosted by Håkon Werle, a wealthy merchant and industrialist. The gathering is attended by his son, Gregers Werle, who has just returned to his father&#x27;s home following a self-imposed exile. There, he learns the fate of a former classmate, Hjalmar Ekdal. Hjalmar married Gina, a young servant in the Werle household. The older Werle had arranged the match by providing Hjalmar with a home and profession as a photographer. Gregers, whose mother died believing that Gina and Håkon had carried on an affair, becomes enraged at the thought that his old friend is living a life built on a lie.

The remaining four acts take place in Hjalmar Ekdal&#x27;s apartments. The Ekdals initially appear to be living a life of cozy domesticity. Hjalmar&#x27;s father makes a living doing odd copying jobs for Werle. Hjalmar runs a portrait studio out of the apartment. Gina helps him run the business in addition to keeping house. They both dote on their daughter Hedvig. Gregers travels directly to their home from the party. While getting acquainted with the family, Hjalmar confesses that Hedvig is both his greatest joy and greatest sorrow, because she is slowly losing her eyesight. The family eagerly reveals a loft in the apartment where they keep various animals like rabbits and pigeons. Most prized is the wild duck they rescued. The duck was wounded by none other than Werle, whose eyesight is also failing. His shot winged the duck, which dived to the bottom of the lake to drown itself by clinging to the seaweed. However, Werle&#x27;s dog retrieved it, and despite its wounds from the shot and the dog&#x27;s teeth, the Ekdals nursed the duck back to good health.

Gregers decides to rent the spare room in the apartment. The next day, he begins to realize that there are more lies hanging over the Ekdals than Gina&#x27;s affair with his father. While talking to Hedvig, she explains that Hjalmar keeps her from school because of her eyesight, but he has no time to tutor her, leaving the girl to escape into imaginary worlds through pictures she sees in books. During their conversation, Gregers hears shots in the attic, and the family explains that Old Ekdal entertains himself by hunting rabbits and birds in the loft, and Hjalmar often joins in the hunts. The activity helps Old Ekdal cling to his former life as a great hunter. Hjalmar also speaks of his &#x27;great invention&#x27;, which he never specifies. It is related to photography, and he is certain that it will enable him to pay off his debts to Werle and finally make himself and his family completely independent. In order to work on his invention, he often needs to lie down on the couch and think about it.

During a lunch with Gregers and Hjalmar&#x27;s friends Relling and Molvik, Håkon arrives to try to convince Gregers to return home. Gregers insists that he cannot return and that he will tell Hjalmar the truth. Håkon is certain that Hjalmar will not be grateful for Gregers&#x27; intervention. After he leaves, Gregers asks Hjalmar to accompany him on a walk, where he reveals the truth about Gina&#x27;s affair with his father.

Upon returning home, Hjalmar is aloof from his wife and daughter. He demands to handle all future photography business by himself with no help from Gina. He also demands to manage the family&#x27;s finances, which Gina has traditionally done. Gina begs him to reconsider, suggesting that with all his time consumed he will not be able to work on his invention. Hedvig adds that he also will not have time to spend in the loft with the wild duck. Embittered by Gregers&#x27; news, Hjalmar bristles at the suggestion and confesses that he would like to wring the duck&#x27;s neck. Indulging his mood, Hjalmar confronts Gina about her affair with Håkon. She confesses to it, but insists that she loves Hjalmar intensely.

In the midst of the argument, Gregers returns, stunned to find that the couple are not overjoyed to be living without such a lie hanging over their heads. Mrs. Sørby arrives with a letter for Hedvig, and the news that she herself is marrying Håkon. The letter announces that Håkon is paying Old Ekdal a pension of 100 crowns per month until his death. Upon his death, the allowance will be transferred to Hedvig for the remainder of her life. This news sickens Hjalmar even further, and it dawns on him that Hedvig may very well be Håkon&#x27;s child. He cannot stand the sight of Hedvig any longer, and leaves the house to drink with Molvik and Relling. Gregers tries to calm the distraught Hedvig by suggesting that she sacrifice the wild duck for her father&#x27;s happiness. Hedvig is desperate to win back her father&#x27;s love, and agrees to have her grandfather shoot the duck in the morning.

The next day, Relling arrives to tell the family that Hjalmar has stayed with him. He is appalled at what Gregers has done, and he reveals that he long ago implanted the idea of the invention with Hjalmar as a &quot;life-lie&quot; to keep him from giving in to despair. The pair argue as Hjalmar returns to gather his materials to work on the invention. He is overwhelmed by the number of details involved in moving out of the apartment. Hedvig is overjoyed to see him, but Hjalmar demands to be &quot;free from intruders&quot; while he thinks about his next move. Crushed, Hedvig remembers the wild duck and goes to the loft with a pistol. After hearing a shot, the family assumes Old Ekdal is hunting in the loft, but Gregers knows he has shot the wild duck for Hedvig. He explains the sacrifice to Hjalmar who is deeply touched. When Old Ekdal emerges from his room, the family realizes he could not have fired the gun in the loft. They rush in to see Hedvig lying on the ground. No one can find a wound, and Relling has to examine the girl. He finds that the shot has penetrated her breastbone and she died immediately. Given the powder burns on her shirt, he determines that she shot herself. Hjalmar begs for her to live again so that she can see how much he loves her. The play ends with Relling and Gregers arguing again. Gregers insists that Hedvig did not die in vain, because her suicide unleashed a greatness within Hjalmar. Relling sneers at the notion, and insists that Hjalmar will be a drunk within a year.

==Analysis and criticism==
Guided by a fervent strain of idealism, Gregers endeavors to reveal the truth to Hjalmar, and thereby free him from the mendacity which surrounds him. To that end, Gregers takes up residence in the Ekdal home.

He meddles in the affairs of a strange family, producing disastrous results. Figuratively speaking, he lives in a house whose closets are full of skeletons. Over the course of the play the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals&#x27; apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the &quot;Summons of the Ideal&quot;. This family has achieved a tolerable &quot;modus vivendi&quot; by ignoring the skeletons (among the secrets: Gregers&#x27; father may have impregnated his servant Gina then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child, and Hjalmar&#x27;s father has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle contributed to but allowed Ekdahl alone to take the blame) and by permitting each member to live in a dreamworld of his own—the feckless father believing himself to be a great inventor, the grandfather dwelling on the past when he was a mighty sportsman, and little Hedvig, the child, centering her emotional life on an attic where a wounded wild duck leads a crippled existence in a make-believe forest.

To the idealist all this appears intolerable. To him as to other admirers of Ibsen it must seem that the whole family is leading a life &quot;based on a lie&quot;; all sorts of evils are &quot;growing in the dark&quot;. The remedy is obviously to face facts, to speak frankly, to let in the light. However, in this play the revelation of the truth is &quot;not&quot; a happy event because it rips up the foundation of the Ekdal family. When the skeletons are brought out of the closet, the whole dreamworld collapses; the weak husband thinks it is his duty to leave his wife, and the little girl, after trying to sacrifice her precious duck, shoots herself with the same gun (overhearing the fatal words from Hjalmar: &quot;Would she lay down her life for me?&quot;). One of the famous quotes from the doctor Relling who built up and maintained the lies the family is founded on is &quot;Deprive the average human being of his life-lie, and you rob him of his happiness.&quot;

Different translations use different words for the &quot;life-lie&quot;. In Eva le Gallienne&#x27;s translation, Relling says &quot;I try to discover the Basic Lie – the pet illusion – that makes life possible; and then I foster it.&quot; He also says &quot;No, no; that&#x27;s what I said: the Basic Lie that makes life possible.&quot;

On a symbolical level, Gregers and Relling seem to be opposites (the virtue of truth against the &quot;basic lie&quot;). The two seem to have confronted each other at several cross-roads, and the play ends with an exchange, almost a wager between the two over the possibilities of Hjalmar and his future. In this respect, Relling is a cynic who is not able to think Hjalmar will ever change, while Gregers still thinks there is hope for his eventual &quot;redemption&quot;.

Before the play starts, Gregers worked on a plant in the mountains, and is accused by Relling (present there as well), of &quot;intriguing&quot; with the local serfs (actually commoners). Thus, there is a social criticism in the play, where Gregers is trying to get in touch with common men, whilst his father is mingling with high society figures – a setting in which his friend Hjalmar Ekdal is a stranger, and his father, disgraced by old Werle, is ignored by his son amongst his betters. From a social rather than a symbolic point of view, Gregers is trying to root out an unhealthy system, arguing that &quot;truth shall set you free&quot;. In that respect, Relling, plotting with old Werle, is an advocate for the same system, and initially the opposite of Gregers.

One could argue that Gregers would feel responsible for the Ekdal family and their plight, as this is an apparent consequence of his father&#x27;s manipulations and schemes. Early on, he mentions that his mother obviously died from neglect, or was driven into alcoholism by her husband&#x27;s actions. As old Werle points out: &quot;you see me with the eyes of your mother&quot;. In this respect, the Ekdal family are helpless victims, and so is Hedvig.

==Background==
Robert Ferguson notes that &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; did not come easily to Ibsen. During the writing process, Norway was characterized by political turmoil, and from his voluntary exile in Rome, Ibsen was concerned that &quot;the strength of an intimate, personal play such as &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; might drown in the political debate over the introduction of parliamentarism in Norway&quot;. In the spring of 1884 a young relative, Count Christopher Paus, paid Ibsen an extended visit to Rome. Jørgen Haave wrote that &quot;Ibsen had not been this close to his own family since he left his hometown over 30 years ago;&quot; it fact it was the only meeting between Ibsen and his family during Ibsen&#x27;s decades in exile. Ibsen was eager to hear news regarding the family in Skien. Shortly after the meeting Ibsen declared that he had overcome a writer&#x27;s block and that he &quot;writes with full force.&quot; In the summer of 1884 he completed the play in Gossensaß.

As in many of Ibsen&#x27;s plays, characters are based on or named after his family members to a greater or lesser extent. The character Old Ekdal is regarded by most Ibsen scholars as one of Ibsen&#x27;s most important literary portraits of his father Knud Ibsen. Ibsen had previously portrayed his father as the characters &quot;Jon Gynt&quot; and &quot;Daniel Hejre&quot;, where the son&#x27;s judgment of his father&#x27;s wastefulness was both harsh and bitter. In old Ekdal&#x27;s character, however, the poet looks at his father, &quot;the forlorn Knud Ibsen, in a conciliatory and compassionate way&quot;.

According to Ibsen scholar Jon Nygaard, the character Gregers Werle represents the spirit of the Paus family and Upper Telemark, a broader theme that is found in many of Ibsen&#x27;s plays; Nygaard points out that Høydalsverket, where Werle lived for years, is an obvious reference to Upper Telemark and especially Høydalsmo; Ibsen&#x27;s ancestor Paul Paus owned Høydalsmo Stave Church.

The character Hedvig is named after the Paus family, where the Hedvig name had been passed on for generations, and more specifically after Ibsen&#x27;s grandmother Hedevig Paus and sister Hedvig Ibsen.

Ibsen&#x27;s model for Hedvig, especially her outward appearance, was a 13-year-old Italian-resident German girl he met in Gossensaß in the summer of 1884, Martha Kopf (born 1870), daughter of the sculptor Joseph von Kopf, who lived in Rome. Ibsen wrote in a letter to his son Sigurd Ibsen: &quot;The German sculptor, Professor Kopf from Rome, has with him a 13-year-old daughter, who is the most excellent model for Hedvig that I could wish for; she is beautiful, has a serious face and personality, and is a little greedy.&quot; There is a bust of Martha Kopf by her later husband Hugo Berwald.

<text>In toss juggling, the box is a juggling pattern for 3 objects, most commonly balls or bean bags. Two balls are dedicated to a specific hand with vertical throws, and the third ball is thrown horizontally between the two hands. Its siteswap is (4,2x)(2x,4).

The box pattern can be seen as a synchronous shower (a fountain), which direction is changed at every throw. The half-box is similar, but asynchronous, with siteswap 441. 441 has been described as, &quot;the simplest non-obvious siteswap,&quot; as, &quot;a very popular and pretty pattern,&quot; and, &quot;a great pattern.&quot; The seesaw (siteswap: 612), is also known as the box. It resembles 441 without the two-in-one or an asynchronous (4,2x)(2x,4).

== Vamp Types ==
The horizontal, hand-crossing throw in the box is known as the &quot;vamp&quot;. In a traditional box pattern, the vamp crosses underneath the vertical paths of the other two &quot;side balls&quot;. However, there are several variations on this vamp&#x27;s placement.

==Variations==
=== Inverse box ===
In the inverse box, the siteswap stays the same and two balls (4s) are still thrown in straight lines, but the ball thrown from the right hand is going up and down on the left side and vice versa. This results in rather fast hand movements, because after the right hand has thrown all up on the left side, both hands need to rush to the right so that the left hand can throw the next ball on the right side.

===Outside box===

Outside box is same as the original version, except that the fast horizontal (2x) ball is thrown outside the landing vertical ball and caught outside the next thrown vertical ball. For visual appeal, the 2x should thrown as vertical as possible; very easily its flight path becomes too arced and the trick loses its visual appeal.

===Luke&#x27;s shuffle===
Luke&#x27;s shuffle is a variation on the box in which the throws that are normally thrown horizontally are thrown diagonally downward. In this pattern, the siteswap stays the same, but the throw involves carrying the ball up over the rising 4 throw. The ball is then thrown from above the 4 diagonally downward to the opposite hand. The resulting downward throw is often known as a shuffle, giving the trick its name. This trick was invented by Luke Jugglestruck (Luke Gravett) in 1991 and shown to Charlie Dancey who included it in his book.

<text>The High Value engine family from General Motors is a group of cam-in-block or overhead valve V6 engines. These engines feature cast iron blocks and aluminum heads, and use the same 60° vee bank as the 60° V6 family they are based on, but the new bore required offsetting the bores by away from the engine center line. These engines (aside from the LX9) are the first cam-in-block engines to implement variable valve timing, and won the 2006 Breakthrough Award from &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; for this innovation. For the 2007 model year, the 3900 engine featured optional displacement on demand or &quot;Active Fuel Management&quot; which deactivates a bank of cylinders under light load to increase highway fuel economy. It was rumored that GM would produce a 3-valve design, but that never came to be. These engines were produced primarily at the GM factory in Tonawanda, New York, and at the Ramos Arizpe engine plant in Mexico. The assembly line for this engine was manufactured by Hirata Corporation at its powertrain facility in Kumamoto, Japan.

As of the 2012 model year, GM no longer sells these engines in any U.S. market vehicles.

==3.5==
:&quot;These engines should not be confused with the 3.5L DOHC LX5 (Shortstar) V6 engine.&quot;

===LX9===
The LX9 3500 is an OHV engine based on the 3400 V6. Bore and stroke are , for a displacement of . According to a GM press release from October 2002, the 3500 V6 offered improved performance and fuel efficiency, as well as reduced emissions and NVH compared to the 3400 V6. The 3500 V6 featured an updated powertrain control module, electronic throttle control, fuel injection system, exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, accessory drive system, and improved cooling and sealing systems. Power output ranges from to , and torque ranges from to .

Applications:
* 2005–2006 Buick Terraza/Chevrolet Uplander/Pontiac Montana SV6/Saturn Relay
* 2004–2006 Chevrolet Malibu/Chevrolet Malibu Maxx
* 2005–2006 Pontiac G6 Sedan / Coupe
* 2006–2007 Buick Rendezvous
* 2006 Pontiac G6 GT Convertible

===LZ4===

The LZ4 3500 is an OHV engine that uses a block similar to the 3.9L &quot;LZ9&quot; V6. It was introduced for the 2006 model year Impala and Monte Carlo. Bore is the same , but the stroke is reduced to for a displacement of . It includes continuously variable cam timing (fixed overlap). Output is at 5800 rpm and at 4000 rpm. Horsepower rating changed for the 2007 model year to at 5800 rpm and torque at 4000 rpm. The Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac G6, and Saturn Aura came equipped with this engine for 2007 (previously, the Malibu and G6 had the non-VVT 3.5 L &quot;LX9&quot;). In 2008, the SAE horsepower rating was dropped to , keeping torque as is. On Pontiac G6 convertible models, horsepower was rated at .

Applications:
* 2006–2009 Chevrolet Impala
* 2006–2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo
* 2008–2010 Chevrolet Malibu Fleet
* 2007 Chevrolet Malibu Sedan/ Maxx
* 2007–2009 Saturn Aura
* 2007–2010 Pontiac G6
* 2008–2010 Saturn Vue XE AWD LZ4 (Note: Only vehicle to have used the GM METRIC bellhousing for 6T70)
Note: GM often refers to this engine in its literature as a &quot;3.5L V6 with Variable Valve Timing.&quot;

===LZE===
The LZE 3500 is an OHV flexible-fuel engine based on the 3.5L &quot;LZ4&quot; V6 (it can use either plain gasoline or E85) and includes continuously variable cam timing (fixed overlap). Bore and stroke are , for a displacement of . Output is at 5800 rpm and at 4000 rpm.

Applications:
* 2006–2011 Chevrolet Impala
* 2006–2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo

==3.9==
Bore and stroke are for a displacement of .

===LZ9===
The LZ9 3900 has roller rocker arms, a variable length intake manifold, and Variable Cam Timing, a novelty on a pushrod engine. A computer-controlled plenum divider, along with the VVT cam function, improves efficiency across a broader RPM range.

It produces up to and of torque, with a wide torque curve. At least 90% of the maximum torque output is available from 1500 rpm to 5500 rpm.

Applications:
* 2006 Pontiac G6 GTP Sedan / Coupe / Convertible
* 2007 Pontiac G6 GT Sport Package Sedan / Coupe
* 2007–2009 Pontiac G6 GT Sport Package Convertible

* 2009–2011 Buick Lucerne ( ( in California-emissions states))

===LGD===

The LGD 3900 is a flexible-fuel version of the LZ9, and like its 3.5L LZE counterpart, it can run on E85, pure gasoline, or any mixture of the two. This is the last version of the 3900 V6. The LGD was not available with Active Fuel Management. Output is slightly reduced at 230 horsepower at 5700 rpm and 235 lb-ft of torque at 3200 rpm.

Applications:

* 2007–2009 Buick Terraza/Chevrolet Uplander/Pontiac Montana SV6
* 2009–2011 Buick Lucerne/Chevrolet Impala
* 2007 Saturn Relay &quot;(fleet only)&quot;

===LZ8 and LZG===
The LZ8 3900 has the same Variable Cam Timing technology as the LZ9. The 2007 model year introduces the Active Fuel Management system (formerly known as Displacement on Demand), which can turn off a bank of cylinders under a light load for increased fuel economy. Output is slightly lower than the LZ9 at and . For 2008, it was replaced by the LZG 3900, a flexible-fuel version of the LZ8.

Applications:

* 2007 Chevrolet Impala (LZ8)
* 2008 Chevrolet Impala (LZG)

The LZ8 was replaced by the LGD for 2009.

<doc id="904335" wikidata="Q1102106" url="?curid=904335" title="Clockwise (film)">
<text>Clockwise is a 1986 British comedy road film starring John Cleese, directed by Christopher Morahan, written by Michael Frayn and produced by Michael Codron. The film&#x27;s music was composed by George Fenton.

For his performance Cleese won the 1987 Peter Sellers Award For Comedy at the Evening Standard British Film Awards. Most urban scenes were shot in the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, while rural scenes were largely shot in Shropshire. Menzies High School in West Bromwich was used to portray the fictional school within the film.

It was the last film credit for executive Nat Cohen and has been called &quot;a classy final credit&quot;.
==Plot==
Brian Stimpson, headmaster of Thomas Tompion Comprehensive School, has been elected to chair the annual Headmasters&#x27; Conference meeting in Norwich. Openly careless as a young man, Stimpson is now compulsively organised and punctual and his school runs &quot;like clockwork&quot;. Stimpson is the first headmaster of a comprehensive school to chair the Headmasters&#x27; Conference, that honour usually being reserved for heads of the more prestigious private schools.

Despite constant rehearsal of his speech and preparations for the journey to the conference, Stimpson&#x27;s ordered world unwinds as a series of unfortunate circumstances delay him en route. He mistakenly boards the wrong train, missing his connection for Norwich, owing to a lingering habit of saying &quot;right&quot; as emphasis in situations where it would be mistaken for a direction; then, in his desperation to board the departing correct train, he leaves the text of his speech behind on the wrong one, and is finally left at the railway station by his wife, who thinks he departed on the train.

Determined to get to Norwich on time, Stimpson searches for his wife at home and then at the hospital where she volunteers looking after dementia patients, but narrowly misses her. Attempting to hail a taxi, Stimpson stumbles across Laura Wisely, one of his sixth form students, who is driving and playing truant during a study break; he commandeers her and her car in a bid to drive to Norwich.

Stimpson&#x27;s wife sees the two at a petrol station, assuming that her husband is carrying on with the student and taking her down to attend the conference. Mrs. Stimpson, who is still looking after three senile old women, drives after Stimpson and both parties forget to pay for their petrol. The police are called and, responding to a call from Laura&#x27;s parents reporting the car as stolen and their daughter as missing, attempt to find Stimpson and arrest him for kidnapping. Stimpson&#x27;s wife, Laura&#x27;s parents, the police and Mr. Jolly, a music teacher at Thomas Tompion who has secretly been dating Laura, all pursue Stimpson and Laura to the conference.

Taking a break, Stimpson and Laura try to call the conference from a telephone box. A local mistakes them for vandals after Stimpson vents his frustrations at the malfunctioning phones, and calls the police. The local sends her daughter Pat to Stimpson, but she turns out to be a childhood friend and former girlfriend of Stimpson. Stimpson coerces her into driving them to the conference.

After a series of wrong turns, the group desperately turn into a farmer&#x27;s field in order to escape cows and a lorry, and shortly after get stuck in deep mud. Brian leaves the stuck car to seek help, and ends up at a monastery where he is persuaded to take a bath and collect himself. While he&#x27;s gone, a local farmer tugs the car out of the mud; Pat finally drives away in the car but is soon arrested for assaulting a police officer. All the while, Stimpson&#x27;s wife and the others arrive at the conference uninvited, much to the horror of the headmasters; they attempt to sequester the growing group of concerned parents, wives, senile ladies and police officers as the conference continues.

Stranded without transport, Laura and Stimpson (who is dressed in monks&#x27; robes, leaving his muddy suit with the monks) attempt to hitchhike. They are picked up by a wealthy car salesman, whom they persuade to come for a walk in the woods. They trick the traveller into swapping clothes with Stimpson under the guise of foreplay, but Stimpson and Laura run away and steal his car.

Stimpson finally arrives at the conference in the torn suit of the car salesman and delivers an improvised recount of his lost speech, which becomes increasingly mocking and oppressive in tone to the disappointed headmasters. During his speech various characters including the old women, Mr. Jolly and Laura&#x27;s parents walk into the hall, and Stimpson addresses them like he would late pupils, ordering and humiliating the entire collected group with the same authoritarian demeanour with which he runs his own school. Finally, he directs all of the headmasters to stand and sing the hymn &quot;To Be a Pilgrim&quot;, as he walks out of the building to face the police. The headmasters watch on as Stimpson and the rest of the party are all led away by policemen, with Stimpson still giving headmasterly orders to all the officers in the car.

==Production==
The film was an original script by Michael Frayn, then better known as a novelist and playwright. Frayn wrote it on &quot;spec&quot;. He said, &quot;I had always wanted to write something about a man who is late because I have considerable problems in relation to that myself, and only get places early by enormous expenditure of psychic energy.&quot;

He showed it to theatrical producer Michael Codron, who had produced five Frayn works on stage including the hugely successful &quot;Benefactors&quot; and &quot;Noises Off&quot;, and asked if Codron would like to produce it. &quot;I said, &#x27;Why not?&#x27;&quot; said the producer. &quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in movies.&quot;

Codron showed the script to Nat Cohen at EMI Films who gave it to the company&#x27;s head of production Verity Lambert and she agreed to finance. The title was originally &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; but this was changed when it was realised that had been used for a Norman Wisdom film.

John Cleese was signed to star. &quot;No one will believe it but I didn&#x27;t have an idea for casting,&quot; said Frayn.

Cleese later said the script was &quot;the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. The same day it landed on my front door, I rang my agent and said, &#x27;I have to do this.&#x27; &quot;

&quot;Stimpson is a victim of circumstance,&quot; Cleese said. &quot;As the pressures increase, his behaviour becomes more and more erratic. Comedy is about things always going wrong, and that&#x27;s just what happens to him. When you first see him, he&#x27;s in charge. But as events take over and he can&#x27;t cope-that&#x27;s when he falls apart.&quot;

Codron, Cleese and Lambert had a meeting to decide the director. They selected Chris Morahan, who had directed Frayn&#x27;s Chekov adaptation &quot;Wild Honey&quot; on stage and had recently directed &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot; for TV.

===Filming===
Filming took eight weeks in June and July 1985 in Hull, Shropshire and Birmingham. Filming in Grimsby took place on Friday 7 June 1985, at Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital, and moved from there to Birmingham, with 24 year old nurse Sue Tilley.
The road accident scene with a police car was on the A491 at Hagley near Field Road on Thursday 13 June 1985. John Cleese had been a teacher for two years. The assembly scene was filmed at Menzies High School in West Bromwich on Tuesday 18 June 1985, with headteacher Ian Pedder.

The university scene included the University of Birmingham Guild of Students building from 20 to 21 June 1985. Filming moved to Wenlock Priory in late June 1985, in Much Wenlock in Shropshire.

==Reception==
===Critical===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 5 reviews.

&quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; awarded it one star from a possible four, stating &quot;what was intended as an escalating climax of comic chaos falls away as the script runs out of steam, but the nation&#x27;s need for comedy ensured box-office success&quot;. &quot;Radio Times&quot; reviewer John Ferguson awarded it three stars out of five, stating &quot;Cleese finds it difficult to be unfunny and he unravels here much like Basil Fawlty, from a simmering starting point to a climax of epic proportions. Perhaps because of Cleese&#x27;s background in TV comedy, the picture is less a narrative than a series of sketches, plus some rather awkwardly placed propaganda about public and private education in that far-off land called Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s Britain.&quot; He concluded that it was &quot;entertaining fare&quot; but &quot;doesn&#x27;t stand comparison&quot; with Cleese&#x27;s next comedy film, &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988).
===Box office===
Although popular in Britain (where it made nearly £5 million), the film only played art houses in the US, earning $1.6 millon. This prompted Cleese to make &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; to be accessible to American audiences, to &quot;get out of the art houses&quot; there. Cleese later recalled &quot;there was a scene where I had to make a call from a public phone booth. None of the phones worked and I had to go from booth to booth with increasing fury before I found one that did. In England, that scene got a big laugh because no one here expects the phones to work. But it played to total silence in America, where they all expect to get through on a phone the first time.&quot;
===Legacy===
A line spoken by Stimpson has become famous, &quot;It&#x27;s not the despair, Laura. I can stand the despair. It&#x27;s the hope!&quot; and has been quoted (and misquoted, often as &quot;It&#x27;s the hope I can&#x27;t stand!&quot;) many times in newspapers and books.

<text>Raymond Samuel Tomlinson (April 23, 1941 – March 5, 2016) was an American computer programmer who implemented the first email program on the ARPANET system, the precursor to the Internet, in 1971; It was the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts connected to ARPANET. Previously, mail could be sent only to others who used the same computer. To achieve this, he used the @ sign to separate the user name from the name of their machine, a scheme which has been used in email addresses ever since. The Internet Hall of Fame in its account of his work commented &quot;Tomlinson&#x27;s email program brought about a complete revolution, fundamentally changing the way people communicate.&quot; He is credited with the invention of the TCP three-way handshake which underlies HTTP and many other key Internet protocols.

==Early life and education==
Tomlinson was born in Amsterdam, New York, but his family soon moved to the small, unincorporated village of Vail Mills, Broadalbin, New York. His father Raymond Tomlinson worked in carpet mills and later worked in the grocery business. His mother Dorothy Tomlinson worked for a dry cleaner. He attended Broadalbin Central School in nearby Broadalbin, New York. Later he attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York where he participated in the co-op program with IBM. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from RPI in 1963.

After graduating from RPI, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to continue his electrical engineering education. At MIT, Tomlinson worked in the Speech Communication Group and developed an analog-digital hybrid speech synthesizer as the subject of his thesis for the master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering, which he received in 1965.

==Career==
In 1967, he joined the technology company of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (now BBN Technologies), where he helped develop the TENEX operating system including the ARPANET Network Control Program, implementations of Telnet, and implementations on the self-replicating programs Creeper and Reaper. He wrote a file transfer program called CPYNET to transfer files through the ARPANET. Tomlinson was asked to change a program called SNDMSG, which sent messages to other users of a time-sharing computer, to run on TENEX. He added code he took from CPYNET to SNDMSG so messages could be sent to users on &quot;other&quot; computers—the first email.

The first email Tomlinson sent was a test. It was not preserved and Tomlinson describes it as insignificant, &quot;something like &quot;QWERTYUIOP.&quot;&quot; This is commonly misquoted as &quot;The first e-mail was QWERTYUIOP.&quot; Tomlinson later commented that these &quot;test messages were entirely forgettable and I have, therefore, forgotten them.&quot;

At first, his email messaging system was not considered important. Its development was not a directive of his employer, with Tomlinson merely pursuing it &quot;because it seemed like a neat idea.&quot; When showing the system to a colleague, Tomlinson said &quot;Don&#x27;t tell anyone! This isn&#x27;t what we&#x27;re supposed to be working on.&quot;

Tomlinson said he preferred &quot;email&quot; over &quot;e-mail,&quot; joking in a 2010 interview that &quot;I&#x27;m simply trying to conserve the world&#x27;s supply of hyphens&quot; and that &quot;the term has been in use long enough to drop the hyphen.&quot;

Tomlinson died at his home in Lincoln, Massachusetts, on March 5, 2016, from a heart attack. He was 74 years old.

==Awards and honors==
* In 2000 he received the George R. Stibitz Computer Pioneer Award from the American Computer Museum (with the Computer Science Department of Montana State University).
* In 2001 he received a Webby Award from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences for lifetime achievement. Also in 2001 he was inducted into the Rensselaer Alumni Hall of Fame.
* In 2002 &quot;Discover&quot; magazine awarded him its Innovative Innovating Award of Innovation.
* In 2004, he received the IEEE Internet Award along with Dave Crocker.
* In 2009, he along with Martin Cooper was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for scientific and technical research.
* In 2011, he was listed 4th in the MIT150 list of the top 150 innovators and ideas from MIT.
* In 2012, Tomlinson was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.
* In 2022, Email Day, an annual, national holiday was established in honor of Ray Tomlinson and his creation of email. April 23 (Tomlinson&#x27;s birthday) was chosen.

<doc id="904341" wikidata="Q4944820" url="?curid=904341" title="Bored cylindrical lock">
<text>A bored cylindrical lock is a lockset which is installed by boring two circular holes in the door. Door handles may also use the same installation.
==Installation==
Two holes are bored, perpendicular to one another, into the door. The &quot;face bore&quot; is the larger hole which is bored into the door face and a smaller &quot;edge bore&quot; hole is bored into the door edge. The edge may require additional preparation to receive the latch assembly, typically by routing or chiseling a shallow mortise. Some commercially-sold doors may come prepared to receive one or more bored cylindrical locks, such as entry doors, which typically require both a door knob and dead bolt.

In the United States, typically, the face bore is sized from in diameter and is centered at from the leading edge of the door. This distance is referred to as the &quot;backset.&quot; Other, less popular, backsets are at . Residential doors are normally prepared with a backset and commercial doors have a backset. The edge bore is typically centered on the edge.

==History==
The modern bored cylindrical lock was invented by the German-born engineer Walter Schlage in 1923, as an innovation on a patent filed in 1920 for a lock whose installation required a face bore and surface rabbet, simplifying door preparation compared to a traditional mortise lock.

With the purpose of lowering the cost of lock installations, the cylindrical lock requires significantly less labor and materials than its predecessors. The previous standard, the mortise lock, needs a lot more wood to be removed from the door to fit its large and intricate lock body inside. 

With its lower manufacturing cost and ease of installation, the cylindrical lock supplanted the mortise lock as the norm in the United States; Europe, however, did not see widespread adoption, and continues to use the mortise lock as the norm.

As a cheaper alternative, the cylindrical lock comes with fewer functions than a traditional installation; For instance, while a mortise lock can contain both a latch and deadbolt in one unit, the cylindrical lock can only have one of the two. In practice, this means that a cylindrical lock is less secure than a mortise lock unless paired with a deadbolt.

<text>The Duramax V8 engine is a family of 6.6-liter diesel V8 engines produced by DMAX, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors in Moraine, Ohio. The Duramax block and heads are supplied from reliable vendors of General Motors. This engine was initially installed in 2001 Chevrolet and GMC trucks, and has since become an option in pickups, vans, and medium-duty trucks. In 2006, production at Moraine was reportedly limited to approximately 200,000 engines per year. On May 9, 2007, DMAX announced the production of the 1,000,000th Duramax V8 at its Moraine facility, followed by the 2,000,000th on March 24, 2017.

==Engine RPO codes==

===LB7===
RPO LB7 (engine code &quot;1&quot;) was first introduced in 2001 and continued until early 2004. It featured a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and aluminum cylinder heads.

The following trucks use the LB7:
*Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick
* Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra HD

====Specifications====
* Block / Head: Cast Iron / Aluminum
* Compression: 17.5:1
* Injection: Direct; Bosch high-pressure common-rail
* Power / Torque: at 3,100 rpm / at 1,800 rpm
The LLY was introduced in 2004 and completely replaced the LB7 mid-year.

===LLY===
The LLY (internally called the &quot;8GF1&quot;) (engine code &quot;2&quot;) is a turbocharged engine which debuted in mid-2004 and continued until the end of 2005 (except the Hummer H1 in 2006). It is a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and aluminum cylinder heads. The LLY was GM&#x27;s first attempt to implement emissions requirements on their diesel trucks. To meet this goal, they turned to a newly developed Garrett turbocharger with a variable geometry vane system and installed an EGR valve. Learning from problems with injectors in the previous LB7, GM changed the valve covers to allow access to the injectors without having to remove the valve covers, saving significant labor costs if injector replacement became necessary.

The following trucks used the LLY engine:
* 2006-only Hummer H1 Alpha
* Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500

====Specifications====

* Block / Head: Cast gray iron / Cast aluminum
* Compression: 17.5:1
* Injection: Bosch high-pressure common-rail
* Power / Torque: at 3000 rpm / at 1600 rpm
* Head casting is 8GF1
* Block casting is #22351021213

===LLY/LBZ===
There are two VIN codes for the LBZ. The first is VIN 2 produced in late 2005 and early 2006. The VIN 2 engine is mechanically and physically the same as the VIN D engine but utilizes LLY engine tuning due to the LBZ tuning taking longer to be EPA certified and placed into production.

The second is VIN D. This was introduced in 2006 and continued into 2007 sold only in the &quot;classic&quot; body style. It has an improved engine computer tune that produces increased power and torque over the 2005 LLY version of the engine. This also marked the first appearance of the Duramax in the Express/Savana vans. The LBZ is one of the more sought-after Duramax engines because of its strength, reliability, and being pre-emissions (DPF appeared on the next generation LMM in 2007).

Changes include:
* Cylinder block casting and machining changes strengthen the bottom of the cylinder bores to support increased power and torque
* Upgraded main bearing material increases durability
* Revised piston design lowers compression ratio to 16.8:1 from 17.5:1
* Piston pin bore diameter increased for added strength
* Connecting rod &quot;I&quot; section is thicker for added strength
* Cylinder heads revised to accommodate lower compression and reduced cylinder firing pressure
* Maximum injection pressure increased from to more than 
* Fuel delivered via higher-pressure pump, fuel rails, distribution lines and all-new, seven-hole fuel injectors
* Fuel injectors spray directly onto glow plugs, providing faster, better-quality starts and more complete cold-start combustion for reduced emissions
* Improved glow plugs heat up faster through an independent controller
* Revised variable-geometry turbocharger is aerodynamically more efficient to help deliver smooth and immediate response and lower emissions
* Air induction system re-tuned to enhance quietness
* EGR has larger cooler to bring more exhaust into the system
* First application of new, 32-bit E35 controller, which adjusts and compensates for the fuel flow to bolster efficiency and reduce emissions

LBZ applications:

* Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500
* Chevrolet Kodiak
* GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500
* GMC TopKick
* Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500 Classic 
LLY applications:
* Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500
* Chevrolet Kodiak
* GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500
* Chevrolet Express full-size (reduced power output mated to a 4L85E transmission)
* GMC Savana full-size (reduced power output mated to a 4L85E transmission)

====Specifications====

* Block / Head: Cast gray iron / Cast aluminum
* Compression: 16.8:1
* Injection: Bosch high-pressure common-rail
* Power / Torque: 360 bhp @3200 rpm / 650 lb-ft @1600 rpm

===LMM===

The LMM (engine code &quot;6&quot;) debuted part way through 2007 and ended production with the start of the 2011 calendar year and is mated to the 6-speed Allison transmission. The LMM was the only Duramax offered for model years 2007–2010. A version was used in the Trident Iceni.

====Specifications====

* Block / Head: Cast gray iron / Cast aluminum
* Compression: 16.8:1
* Injection: Bosch high-pressure common-rail with CP3.3 injection pump
* Power / Torque: at 3200 rpm / at 1600 rpm

Emission controls:
* Additional combustion control, including an even more efficient variable-geometry turbocharging system, cooled (enhanced) exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and closed crankcase ventilation to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx)
* Additional exhaust control, including oxidizing catalyst and new diesel particulate filter (DPF) to reduce soot and particulate matter
* Increased-capacity cooling system
* New engine control software
* Use of low-ash engine oil (CJ-4)

Applications:
* 2007–2010 Chevrolet Silverado HD
* 2007–2010 GMC Sierra HD
* 2007–2010 Chevrolet Kodiak
* 2007–2010 GMC TopKick
* 2007–2010 Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana

===LGH===
The 6.6L Duramax diesel engine (VIN code &quot;L&quot;) is used on 2010 interim and 2011 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans and 2011 Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra HD trucks with RPO ZW9 (chassis cabs or trucks with pickup box delete). The LGH engine is rated at at 3,100 rpm and at 1,600 rpm. Similar to the LML, this engine also uses a DPF and DEF system to meet emissions standards.

===LML===
The 6.6L RPO LML (VIN code &quot;8&quot;) is the 2011–2016 version of the Isuzu/GM Duramax V8 diesel engine. It is a further advanced version of the LMM engine with the majority of the changes addressing a required drastic reduction in engine emissions. Some mechanical aspects of the engine, such as piston oil flow design for improved temperature control and oil pump design, were also improved to enhance durability even further.

The LML engine was significantly updated for 2011 to comply with the new federal emissions standards for diesel engines, provide better engine rigidity, and further noise reduction. The engine gained new 29,000 PSI piezo injectors as well as a completely reworked fuel system which was now powered by the Bosch CP4 pump, that also now supports up to 20% biodiesel mixtures and a urea injection (to reduce nitrogen oxides) with a 5.3 gallon DEF tank. This engine has a fuel injector in the exhaust tract, to allow raw fuel injection during the particulate filter recycling routine. The RPO LML engine is rated at at 3,000 rpm and of torque at 1,600 rpm.

===L5P===
The L5P Duramax is the latest version of the Duramax V8 diesel engine.(engine code Y). Introduced in the 2017 model year, it was the most powerful diesel engine GM had produced, with at 2,800 rpm and at 1,600 rpm. Design specification performance can exceed at 3,050 rpm and at 1,975 rpm.

===L5P Gen2===
The L5P Duramax received an increase in horsepower and torque for the 2024 model year; at 2,800 rpm and at 1,600 rpm. Design specification performance can exceed at 3050 rpm and at 1975 rpm.

===L5D===
The L5D Duramax is a downrated version of the L5P for the Chevrolet Silverado MD and International CV trucks (Class 4, 5, and 6). The L5D was downrated to increase reliability and reduce downtime. The L5D was introduced in 2018 for the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado MD and International CV trucks. Specifications for the L5D are at 2,600 rpm and at 1,600 rpm.

<text>Yasmeen Ghauri is a Canadian former fashion model. Ghauri is known for her walk also quoted as the &quot;walk of life&quot; by Tyra Banks. Being Pakistani, she is one of the first women of South Asian descent to appear on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Ghauri was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to a German mother and a Pakistani father who was born in Hyderabad, India and immigrated to Karachi when he was young. According to Ghauri, her paternal family ultimately has origins in Ghor, Afghanistan, and she has identified as being &quot;half South and Central Asian. Raised Muslim, Ghauri had a difficult childhood and was bullied by her classmates at school for her Pakistani heritage. She did her Hajj with her parents at age 12.

== Career ==
At age 17, Ghauri was discovered after walking out of a hair salon and being approached in Montreal by artistic director of Platine Coiffure, Edward Zaccaria. Despite her parents&#x27; disapproval, she actively pursued a modelling career, debuting in Milan and Paris before moving to New York City in 1990. Here, she was noticed by fashion critics and labels alike. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her runway walk as a &quot;ball-bearing swivel of her hips&quot;. Her appearance prompted part of what is now termed in fashion the &quot;Canadian invasion&quot;.

Ghauri&#x27;s first major cover was for Elle Magazine in 1991 and was later booked to walk for high fashion brands. Ghauri did her own makeup because there weren&#x27;t enough shades for her skin tone. In 1992 Yasmeen also walked the infamous Versace ‘Bondage’ show and became the face of Hermès and Lanvin. She also signed with Victoria&#x27;s Secret becoming one of the angels.

Ghauri enjoyed fame in the early 1990s after her first major cover with &quot;Elle&quot; in January 1991. She was also seen in Elton John&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, in which she starred opposite Chris Isaak. Soon after, she became the face of both Chanel and Jil Sander. By the end of 1990, Ghauri appeared on the cover of French &quot;Elle&quot; in July and December. In September, she graced the catwalk for Gianni Versace&#x27;s show in Milan and by the next month, she was walking for Chanel, Helmut Lang, Jean Paul Gaultier and Lanvin in Paris. She became the face of Christian Dior and Anne Klein in 1991. In January, she was photographed by Steven Meisel for the cover of Italian &quot;Vogue&quot; and toward the end of the year, she appeared in British and Italian &quot;Vogue&quot; editorials. Photographer Patrick Demarchelier, who photographed her for the Italian issue, called her his favourite subject.

In 1992, Ghauri became the face of Valentino couture and Versace. According to an NYMag.com online model profile, Ghauri walked the controversial Gianni Versace &quot;Bondage&quot; show in Milan in February 1992. Ghauri became the face of Hermès and Lanvin in 1993 and was photographed by Gilles Bensimon for &quot;Elle&quot;. She appeared in the 1995 documentary &quot;Unzipped&quot; by Isaac Mizrahi. Yasmeen became a frequent face in Victoria’s Secret catalogues and the iconic swimsuit issues, this served to further heighten her success. In 1996 she began to walk in the annual Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show.

Ghauri retired in 1997, confirming speculations that arose after she stepped out of the Yves Saint Laurent show at the last minute.

== Personal life ==
Ghauri is married to lawyer Ralph Bernstein, with whom she has a daughter and a son. The family live in Bedford, New York.

== References in other media ==
Ghauri was the inspiration for the character Jasmine in the comic book series &quot;Jonathan Steele&quot;.

<text>Thomas Chatterton Hammond (20 February 1877 – 16 November 1961) was an Irish Anglican cleric whose work on reformed theology and Protestant apologetics has been influential among evangelicals, especially in Ireland, Australia and South Africa. He was also Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of New South Wales.

==Biography==
Born in Cork to Colman Mark Hammond a farmer and his second wife, Elizabeth (née Sergeant). After his father died in 1883 he lived for some time with a Roman Catholic aunt. He was educated at Cork Model School and at age 13 he went to work as a railway clerk. He became a member of the Church of Ireland in 1892. He also joined the newly formed YMCA in Cork and studied with John McNay (his future brother in law) the YMCA librarian.

At the age of 18 he entered the Irish Church Missions Training School in Dublin. Hammond was ordained as a deacon in the Church of Ireland in 1903 and priest in 1905. He was appointed curate of St. Kevin&#x27;s Church, Camden Row, Dublin, and the Hammond family lived on nearby Synge Street. He received a BA in 1903 and subsequently an MA from Trinity College Dublin. Later in life he was awarded a Th.D. from the Australian College of Theology (ACT). He married Margaret McNay from Cork (of Scottish extraction but born in County Tipperary) in 1906, they had three sons; John Colman, Thomas Chatterton (&#x27;Chat&#x27;), Charles Kimble (&#x27;Carl&#x27;) and a daughter, Doris.

He was superintendent of the Irish Church Missions to the Roman Catholics from 1919 to 1936, where he engaged in evangelistic missions in Dublin and often in controversies with Roman Catholic apologists. A lively intellectual, his expertise in doctrinal difficulty was often sought by the bishops of the Church of Ireland, but not always publicly acknowledged. Hammond also helped draw up the constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia (at that time called the Church of England in Australia) and safe-guarded the independence of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. He was also helpful in drawing up a constitution for the Church of England in South Africa, a denomination which was created separately from the largely Anglo-Catholicism dominated Church of the Province of South Africa.

In 1936, Hammond left Ireland to take up position as Principal of Moore Theological College, Sydney. In addition, he was made the rector of St Philip&#x27;s, York Street. He was made an archdeacon in 1949. His best-known books are &quot;In Understanding be Men&quot; (a handbook of Christian doctrine) and &quot;The One Hundred Texts&quot;, with Bible verses explaining Reformed teaching. He continued to debate Catholics, with his program on radio 2CH competing with that of the Catholic apologist Dr Rumble on 2SM

Hammond was a controversial figure both in Ireland and Australia as a member of the Orange Order in Dublin and Sydney, eventually rising to the position of Grand Master of the Orange Institution of New South Wales in 1961. In recent times, his involvement in the establishment and running of the Bethany Home in Dublin, a home for orphans, unmarried mothers and their children, and petty criminals, has also been raised for questioning, particularly due to the high mortality rate. The home is subject to ongoing calls to be added to the State redress scheme for victims of child, neglect, sexual and physical abuse. Hammond sat on the board of trustees of the Bethany Home from 1922 until 1935, as other members of the Church of Ireland clergy did throughout its existence.

Hammond died on 16 November 1961 in Sydney. A biography, &quot;T C Hammond - Irish Christian&quot;, by Rev. Warren Nelson (founder of the Irish Bible Institute) was published in 1994.

<doc id="904378" wikidata="Q2506594" url="?curid=904378" title="Montgomery modular multiplication">
<text>In modular arithmetic computation, Montgomery modular multiplication, more commonly referred to as Montgomery multiplication, is a method for performing fast modular multiplication. It was introduced in 1985 by the American mathematician Peter L. Montgomery.

Montgomery modular multiplication relies on a special representation of numbers called Montgomery form. The algorithm uses the Montgomery forms of and to efficiently compute the Montgomery form of . The efficiency comes from avoiding expensive division operations. Classical modular multiplication reduces the double-width product using division by and keeping only the remainder. This division requires quotient digit estimation and correction. The Montgomery form, in contrast, depends on a constant which is coprime to , and the only division necessary in Montgomery multiplication is division by . The constant can be chosen so that division by is easy, significantly improving the speed of the algorithm. In practice, is always a power of two, since division by powers of two can be implemented by bit shifting.

The need to convert and into Montgomery form and their product out of Montgomery form means that computing a single product by Montgomery multiplication is slower than the conventional or Barrett reduction algorithms. However, when performing many multiplications in a row, as in modular exponentiation, intermediate results can be left in Montgomery form. Then the initial and final conversions become a negligible fraction of the overall computation. Many important cryptosystems such as RSA and Diffie–Hellman key exchange are based on arithmetic operations modulo a large odd number, and for these cryptosystems, computations using Montgomery multiplication with a power of two are faster than the available alternatives.
== Modular arithmetic ==

Let denote a positive integer modulus. The quotient ring consists of residue classes modulo , that is, its elements are sets of the form
:formula_1
where ranges across the integers. Each residue class is a set of integers such that the difference of any two integers in the set is divisible by (and the residue class is maximal with respect to that property; integers aren&#x27;t left out of the residue class unless they would violate the divisibility condition). The residue class corresponding to is denoted . Equality of residue classes is called congruence and is denoted
:formula_2
Storing an entire residue class on a computer is impossible because the residue class has infinitely many elements. Instead, residue classes are stored as representatives. Conventionally, these representatives are the integers for which . If is an integer, then the representative of is written . When writing congruences, it is common to identify an integer with the residue class it represents. With this convention, the above equality is written .

Arithmetic on residue classes is done by first performing integer arithmetic on their representatives. The output of the integer operation determines a residue class, and the output of the modular operation is determined by computing the residue class&#x27;s representative. For example, if , then the sum of the residue classes and is computed by finding the integer sum , then determining , the integer between 0 and 16 whose difference with 22 is a multiple of 17. In this case, that integer is 5, so .
== Montgomery form ==

If and are integers in the range , then their sum is in the range and their difference is in the range , so determining the representative in requires at most one subtraction or addition (respectively) of . However, the product is in the range . Storing the intermediate integer product requires twice as many bits as either or , and efficiently determining the representative in requires division. Mathematically, the integer between 0 and that is congruent to can be expressed by applying the Euclidean division theorem:
:formula_3
where is the quotient formula_4 and , the remainder, is in the interval . The remainder is . Determining can be done by computing , then subtracting from . For example, again with formula_5, the product is determined by computing formula_6, dividing formula_7, and subtracting formula_8.

Because the computation of requires division, it is undesirably expensive on most computer hardware. Montgomery form is a different way of expressing the elements of the ring in which modular products can be computed without expensive divisions. While divisions are still necessary, they can be done with respect to a different divisor . This divisor can be chosen to be a power of two, for which division can be replaced by shifting, or a whole number of machine words, for which division can be replaced by omitting words. These divisions are fast, so most of the cost of computing modular products using Montgomery form is the cost of computing ordinary products.

The auxiliary modulus must be a positive integer such that . For computational purposes it is also necessary that division and reduction modulo are inexpensive, and the modulus is not useful for modular multiplication unless . The &quot;Montgomery form&quot; of the residue class with respect to is , that is, it is the representative of the residue class . For example, suppose that and that . The Montgomery forms of 3, 5, 7, and 15 are , , , and .

Addition and subtraction in Montgomery form are the same as ordinary modular addition and subtraction because of the distributive law:
:formula_9
:formula_10
Note that doing the operation in Montgomery form does not lose information compared to doing it in the quotient ring . This is a consequence of the fact that, because , multiplication by is an isomorphism on the additive group . For example, , which in Montgomery form becomes .

Multiplication in Montgomery form, however, is seemingly more complicated. The usual product of and does not represent the product of and because it has an extra factor of :
:formula_11
Computing products in Montgomery form requires removing the extra factor of . While division by is cheap, the intermediate product is not divisible by because the modulo operation has destroyed that property. So for instance, the product of the Montgomery forms of 7 and 15 modulo 17, with , is the product of 3 and 4, which is 12. Since 12 is not divisible by 100, additional effort is required to remove the extra factor of .

Removing the extra factor of can be done by multiplying by an integer such that , that is, by an whose residue class is the modular inverse of mod . Then, working modulo ,
:formula_12
The integer exists because of the assumption that and are coprime. It can be constructed using the extended Euclidean algorithm. The extended Euclidean algorithm efficiently determines integers and that satisfy Bézout&#x27;s identity:
, , and:
:formula_13
This shows that it is possible to do multiplication in Montgomery form. A straightforward algorithm to multiply numbers in Montgomery form is therefore to multiply , , and as integers and reduce modulo .

For example, to multiply 7 and 15 modulo 17 in Montgomery form, again with , compute the product of 3 and 4 to get 12 as above. The extended Euclidean algorithm implies that , so . Multiply 12 by 8 to get 96 and reduce modulo 17 to get 11. This is the Montgomery form of 3, as expected.

== The REDC algorithm ==

While the above algorithm is correct, it is slower than multiplication in the standard representation because of the need to multiply by and divide by . &quot;Montgomery reduction&quot;, also known as REDC, is an algorithm that simultaneously computes the product by and reduces modulo more quickly than the naïve method. Unlike conventional modular reduction, which focuses on making the number smaller than , Montgomery reduction focuses on making the number more divisible by . It does this by adding a small multiple of which is sophisticatedly chosen to cancel the residue modulo . Dividing the result by yields a much smaller number. This number is so much smaller that it is nearly the reduction modulo , and computing the reduction modulo requires only a final conditional subtraction. Because all computations are done using only reduction and divisions with respect to , not , the algorithm runs faster than a straightforward modular reduction by division.
 function REDC is
 input: Integers &quot;R&quot; and &quot;N&quot; with ,
 Integer &quot;N&quot;′ in such that ,
 Integer &quot;T&quot; in the range .
 output: Integer &quot;S&quot; in the range such that 
 &quot;m&quot; ← ((&quot;T&quot; mod &quot;R&quot;)&quot;N&quot;′) mod &quot;R&quot;
 &quot;t&quot; ← (&quot;T&quot; + &quot;mN&quot;) / &quot;R&quot;
 if &quot;t&quot; ≥ &quot;N&quot; then
 return 
 else
 return &quot;t&quot;
 end if
 end function

To see that this algorithm is correct, first observe that is chosen precisely so that is divisible by . A number is divisible by if and only if it is congruent to zero mod , and we have:
:formula_14
Therefore, is an integer. Second, the output is either or , both of which are congruent to , so to prove that the output is congruent to , it suffices to prove that is , satisfies:
:formula_15
Therefore, the output has the correct residue class. Third, is in , and therefore is between 0 and . Hence is less than , and because it&#x27;s an integer, this puts in the range . Therefore, reducing into the desired range requires at most a single subtraction, so the algorithm&#x27;s output lies in the correct range.

To use REDC to compute the product of 7 and 15 modulo 17, first convert to Montgomery form and multiply as integers to get 12 as above. Then apply REDC with , , , and . The first step sets to . The second step sets to . Notice that is 1100, a multiple of 100 as expected. is set to 11, which is less than 17, so the final result is 11, which agrees with the computation of the previous section.

As another example, consider the product but with . Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, compute , so will be . The Montgomery forms of 7 and 15 are and , respectively. Their product 28 is the input to REDC, and since , the assumptions of REDC are satisfied. To run REDC, set to . Then , so . Because , this is the Montgomery form of .

== Arithmetic in Montgomery form ==

Many operations of interest modulo can be expressed equally well in Montgomery form. Addition, subtraction, negation, comparison for equality, multiplication by an integer not in Montgomery form, and greatest common divisors with may all be done with the standard algorithms. The Jacobi symbol can be calculated as formula_16 as long as formula_17 is stored.

When , most other arithmetic operations can be expressed in terms of REDC. This assumption implies that the product of two representatives mod is less than , the exact hypothesis necessary for REDC to generate correct output. In particular, the product of and is . The combined operation of multiplication and REDC is often called &quot;Montgomery multiplication&quot;.

Conversion into Montgomery form is done by computing . Conversion out of Montgomery form is done by computing . The modular inverse of is . Modular exponentiation can be done using exponentiation by squaring by initializing the initial product to the Montgomery representation of 1, that is, to , and by replacing the multiply and square steps by Montgomery multiplies.

Performing these operations requires knowing at least and . When is a power of a small positive integer , can be computed by Hensel&#x27;s lemma: The inverse of modulo is computed by a naïve algorithm (for instance, if then the inverse is 1), and Hensel&#x27;s lemma is used repeatedly to find the inverse modulo higher and higher powers of , stopping when the inverse modulo is known; is the negation of this inverse. The constants and can be generated as and as . The fundamental operation is to compute REDC of a product. When standalone REDC is needed, it can be computed as REDC of a product with . The only place where a direct reduction modulo is necessary is in the precomputation of .

== Montgomery arithmetic on multiprecision integers ==

Most cryptographic applications require numbers that are hundreds or even thousands of bits long. Such numbers are too large to be stored in a single machine word. Typically, the hardware performs multiplication mod some base , so performing larger multiplications requires combining several small multiplications. The base is typically 2 for microelectronic applications, 28 for 8-bit firmware, or 232 or 264 for software applications.

The REDC algorithm requires products modulo , and typically so that REDC can be used to compute products. However, when is a power of , there is a variant of REDC which requires products only of machine word sized integers. Suppose that positive multi-precision integers are stored little endian, that is, is stored as an array such that for all and . The algorithm begins with a multiprecision integer and reduces it one word at a time. First an appropriate multiple of is added to make divisible by . Then a multiple of is added to make divisible by , and so on. Eventually is divisible by , and after division by the algorithm is in the same place as REDC was after the computation of .

The final comparison and subtraction is done by the standard algorithms.

The above algorithm is correct for essentially the same reasons that REDC is correct. Each time through the loop, is chosen so that is divisible by . Then is added to . Because this quantity is zero mod , adding it does not affect the value of . If denotes the value of computed in the th iteration of the loop, then the algorithm sets to . Because MultiPrecisionREDC and REDC produce the same output, this sum is the same as the choice of that the REDC algorithm would make.

The last word of , (and consequently ), is used only to hold a carry, as the initial reduction result is bound to a result in the range of . It follows that this extra carry word can be avoided completely if it is known in advance that . On a typical binary implementation, this is equivalent to saying that this carry word can be avoided if the number of bits of is smaller than the number of bits of . Otherwise, the carry will be either zero or one. Depending upon the processor, it may be possible to store this word as a carry flag instead of a full-sized word.

It is possible to combine multiprecision multiplication and REDC into a single algorithm. This combined algorithm is usually called Montgomery multiplication. Several different implementations are described by Koç, Acar, and Kaliski. The algorithm may use as little as words of storage (plus a carry bit).

As an example, let , , and . Suppose that and . The Montgomery representations of and are and . Compute . The initial input to MultiPrecisionREDC will be [6, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7]. The number will be represented as [7, 9, 9]. The extended Euclidean algorithm says that , so will be 7.

 4 0007401 0

Therefore, before the final comparison and subtraction, . The final subtraction yields the number 50. Since the Montgomery representation of is , this is the expected result.

When working in base 2, determining the correct at each stage is particularly easy: If the current working bit is even, then is zero and if it&#x27;s odd, then is one. Furthermore, because each step of MultiPrecisionREDC requires knowing only the lowest bit, Montgomery multiplication can be easily combined with a carry-save adder.

== Side-channel attacks ==

Because Montgomery reduction avoids the correction steps required in conventional division when quotient digit estimates are inaccurate, it is mostly free of the conditional branches which are the primary targets of timing and power side-channel attacks; the sequence of instructions executed is independent of the input operand values. The only exception is the final conditional subtraction of the modulus, but it is easily modified (to always subtract something, either the modulus or zero) to make it resistant. It is of course necessary to ensure that the exponentiation algorithm built around the multiplication primitive is also resistant.

<text>The addax (Addax nasomaculatus), also known as the white antelope and the screwhorn antelope, is an antelope native to the Sahara Desert. The only member of the genus Addax, it was first described scientifically by Henri de Blainville in 1816. As suggested by its alternative name, the pale antelope has long, twisted horns – typically in females and in males. Males stand from at the shoulder, with females at . They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than the males. The colour of the coat depends on the season – in the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders; in the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde.

The addax mainly eats grasses and leaves of any available shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. They are well-adapted to exist in their desert habitat, as they can live without water for long periods of time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. The herd is usually led by one dominant male. Due to its slow movements, the addax is an easy target for its predators: humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs and African wild dogs. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.

The addax is a critically endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN. Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, it is quite common in captivity. The addax was once abundant in North Africa; however it is currently only native to Chad, Mauritania, and Niger. It is extirpated from Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Western Sahara, but has been reintroduced into Morocco and Tunisia.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The scientific name of the addax is &quot;Addax nasomaculatus&quot;. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It is placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Addax&quot; and the family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock&#x27;s Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of the Sahara in Tunisia.

The generic name &quot;Addax&quot; is thought to be obtained from an Arabic word meaning a wild animal with crooked horns. It is also thought to have originated from a Latin word. The name was first used in 1693. The specific name &quot;nasomaculatus&quot; comes from the Latin words &quot;nasus&quot; (or the prefix &quot;naso-&quot;) meaning nose, and &quot;maculatus&quot; meaning spotted, referring to the spots and facial markings of the species. Bedouins use another name for the addax, the Arabic &quot;bakr&quot; (or &quot;bagr&quot;) &quot;al wahsh&quot;, which literally means &quot;the cow of the wild&quot;. That name can be used to refer to other ungulates as well. The other common names of addax are &quot;white antelope&quot; and &quot;screwhorn antelope&quot;.

==Genetics==
The addax has 29 pairs of chromosomes. All chromosomes are acrocentric except for the first pair of autosomes, which are submetacentric. The X chromosome is the largest of the acrocentric chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.

==History and fossil record==
In ancient times, the addax occurred from northern Africa through Arabia and the Levant. Pictures in a tomb, dating back to 2500 BCE, show at least the partial domestication of the addax by the ancient Egyptians. These pictures show addax and some other antelopes tied with ropes to stakes. The number of addax captured by a person were considered an indicator of his high social and economic position in the society. The &quot;pygarg&quot; (&quot;white-buttocked&quot;) beast mentioned in Deuteronomy 14:5 is believed by Henry Baker Tristram to have been an addax. But today, excess poaching has resulted in the extinction of this species in Egypt since the 1960s.

Addax fossils have been found in four sites of Egypt – a 7000 BCE fossil from the Great Sand Sea, a 5000–6000 BCE fossil from Djara, a 4000–7000 BCE fossil from Abu Ballas Stufenmland and a 5000 BCE fossil from Gilf Kebir. Apart from these, fossils have also been excavated from Mittleres Wadi Howar (6300 BCE fossil), and Pleistocene fossils from Grotte Neandertaliens, Jebel Irhoud and Parc d&#x27;Hydra.

==Physical description==

The addax is a spiral-horned antelope. Male addaxes stand from at the shoulder, with females at . They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than the males. The head and body length in both sexes is , with a long tail. The weight of males varies from , and that of females from .

The coloring of the addax&#x27;s coat varies with the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders. In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an &#x27;X&#x27; over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.
The horns, which are found on both males and females, have two to three twists and are typically in females and in males, although the maximum recorded length is . The lower and middle portions of the horns are marked with a series of 30 to 35 ring-shaped ridges. The tail is short and slender, ending in a puff of black hair. The hooves are broad with flat soles and strong dewclaws to help them walk on soft sand. All four feet possess scent glands. The life span of the addax is up to 19 years in the wild, which can be extended to 25 years under captivity.

The addax closely resembles the scimitar oryx, but can be distinguished by its horns and facial markings. While the addax is spiral-horned, the scimitar oryx has decurved long horns. The addax has a brown hair tuft extending from the base of its horns to between its eyes. A white patch, continuing from the brown hair, extends until the middle of the cheek. On the other hand, the scimitar oryx has a white forehead with only a notable brown marking: a brown lateral stripe across its eyes. It differs from other antelopes by having large, square teeth like cattle and lacking the typical facial glands.

=== Addaxes in Souss-Massa National Park, Morocco ===
===Parasites===
The addax is most prone to parasites in moist climatic conditions. Addaxes have always been infected with nematodes in the Trichostrongyloidea and Strongyloidea superfamilies. In an exotic ranch in Texas, an addax was found host to the nematodes &quot;Haemonchus contortus&quot; and &quot;Longistrongylus curvispiculum&quot; in its abomasum, of which the former was dominant.

==Behavior and ecology==
Addax herds contain both males and females, and have from five to 20 members. They will generally stay in one place and only wander widely in search of food. The herd is usually formed around one dominant male. In captivity, males show signs of territoriality and mate guarding while captive females establish dominance hierarchies, with oldest females holding highest rank Herds are more likely to be found along the northern edge of the tropical rain system during the summer and move north as winter falls. They are able to track rainfall and will head for these areas where vegetation is more plentiful. Males are territorial and guard females, while the females establish their own dominance hierarchies.

Due to its slow movements, the addax is an easy target for predators such as humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs and African wild dogs. Caracals, servals and hyenas attack calves. The addax is normally not aggressive, though individuals may charge if they are disturbed.

===Adaptations===

The addax is amply suited to live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. It can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because it gets moisture from its food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists think the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. It also produces highly concentrated urine to conserve water. The pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddles together in shaded areas, and on cool nights rests in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.

In a study, eight addaxes on a diet of grass hay (&quot;Chloris gayana&quot;) were studied to determine the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including a high proportion of slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.

===Diet===

The addax lives in desert terrain where it eats grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily a grazer, its staple foods include &quot;Aristida&quot;, &quot;Panicum&quot;, and &quot;Stipagrostis&quot;, and it will only consume browse, such as leaves of &quot;Acacia&quot; trees in the absence of these grasses. It also eats perennials which turn green and sprout at the slightest bit of humidity or rain. The addax eats only certain parts of the plant and tends to crop the &quot;Aristida&quot; grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on &quot;Panicum&quot; grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while it eats the tender inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax&#x27;s diet, being its main source of protein.

===Reproduction===
Females are sexually mature at 2 to 3 years of age and males at about 2 years. Breeding occurs throughout the year, but it peaks during winter and early spring. In the northern Sahara, breeding peaks at the end of winter and the beginning of spring; in the southern Sahara, breeding peaks from September to October and from January to mid-April. Each estrus bout lasts for one or two days.

In a study, the blood serum of female addaxes was analyzed through immunoassay to know about their luteal phase. Estrous cycle duration was of about 33 days. During pregnancy, ultrasonography showed the uterine horns as coiled. The maximum diameters of the ovarian follicle and the corpus luteum were and . Each female underwent an anovulatory period lasting 39 to 131 days, during which there was no ovulation. Anovulation was rare in winter, which suggested the effect of seasons on the estrous cycle.

Gestation period lasts 257–270 days (about nine months). Females may lie or stand during the delivery, during which one calf is born. A postpartum estrus occurs after two or three days. The calf weighs at birth and is weaned at 23–29 weeks old.

==Habitat and distribution==
The addax inhabits arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts. They can live in extremely arid areas, with less than 100 mm annual rainfall. It also inhabits deserts with tussock grasses (&quot;Stipagrostis&quot; species) and succulent thorn scrub &quot;Cornulaca&quot;. Formerly, the addax was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; but today the only known self-sustaining population is present in the Termit Massif Reserve (Niger). However, there are reports of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (Niger) and Bodélé (Chad). Rare nomads may be seen in northern Niger, southern Algeria and Libya; and the addax is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there have been no confirmed sightings. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Western Sahara. It has been reintroduced into Morocco and Tunisia.

==Threats and conservation==
Declines in the population of the addax have been ongoing since the mid-1800s. More recently, addaxes were found from Algeria to Sudan, but due mainly to overhunting, they have become much more restricted and rare.

Addaxes are easy to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, firearms for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased their numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture. Fewer than 500 individuals are thought to exist in the wild today, most of the animals being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bodélé region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.

Today there are over 600 addaxes in Europe, Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve (Israel), Sabratha (Libya), Giza Zoo (Egypt), North America, Japan and Australia under captive breeding programmes. There are thousands more in private collections and ranches in the United States and the Middle East. Addaxes are legally protected in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria; hunting of all gazelles is forbidden in Libya and Egypt. Although enormous reserves, such as the Hoggar Mountains and Tasilli in Algeria, the Ténéré in Niger, the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in Chad, and the newly established Wadi Howar National Park in Sudan, cover areas where the addax previously occurred, some do not keep addaxes at the present time because they lack the resources. The addax has been reintroduced into Bou-Hedma National Park (Tunisia) and Souss-Massa National Park (Morocco). Reintroductions in the wild are ongoing in Jebil National Park (Tunisia) and Grand Erg Oriental (the Sahara), and another is planned for Morocco.
