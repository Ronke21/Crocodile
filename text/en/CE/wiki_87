<text>Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb (, &quot;Tonb-e Bozorg&quot; and &quot;Tonb-e Kuchak&quot;, , &quot;Tunb el-Kubra&quot; and &quot;Tunb el-Sughra&quot;) are two small islands in the eastern Persian Gulf, close to the Strait of Hormuz. They lie at and , respectively, some from each other and south of the Iranian island of Qeshm. The islands are administered by Iran as part of its Hormozgan province.

Greater Tunb has a surface area of . It is known for its red soil. There are conflicting descriptions about its population: While some sources state there are between a few dozen and a few hundred inhabitants, others describe the island as having no native civilian population. There is reported to be an Iranian garrison and naval station, an aircraft runway, a fish storage facility and a red-soil mine. Lesser Tunb has a surface of and is uninhabited with the exception of a small airfield, harbour, and entrenched Iranian military unit.

==Toponymy==

The toponymy of Tonb is in all likelihood of Persian origin. In the local Persian dialect(s) of southern Persia, the noun Tomb and&quot;Tonb&quot;, with its diminutive &quot;Tonbu&quot; or Tombu, as it applied to Lesser Tonb (Nāmiuh or Nābiuh Tonb), means &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;low elevation&quot; (cfr. Medieval Latin &quot;tumba&quot; and Ancient Greek &quot;tymbos&quot;, with the same meaning, roots for &quot;tomb&quot;). The terms have the same meaning in the larger Dari Persian language system; this explains in part the traces of &quot;tonb&quot; and &quot;tonbu&quot; in the toponyms found in the Bushehr and Lengeh regions, some 300 miles (480 km) apart. There are other toponyms such as Tonb-e Seh in Tangestān and Tonbānu on Qeshm island.

Etymologically, the word TNB is also a proper Arabic word, which means to anchor, according to the Medieval Arab linguist Ibn Fares.

==Dispute==

Reference to Great Tonb as an Iranian island is found in Ibn Balkhi&#x27;s 12th-century &quot;Farsnameh&quot; and Hamdallah Mustawfi Kazvini&#x27;s 14th-century &quot;Nuzhat al-Qulub&quot;. The Tonbs were dominions of the Kings of Hormuz from 1330 or so until Hormuz&#x27;s capitulation to the Portuguese in 1507. The Tonbs remained a part of the Hormuzi-Portuguese administration until 1622, when the Portuguese were expelled from the Persian littoral by the Persian central government. During this period, the human geography, commerce, and territorial administration of the Tonbs, along with Abu Musa and Sirri islands, became intimately connected with the province of Fars, notably the Persian ports of Bandar Lengeh and Bandar Kang, and the nearby Qeshm and Hengam islands.

It has been remarked, in the context of the limits of the Persian empire in the Persian Gulf in the middle of the 18th century, that &quot;[a]ll the islands off the Persian coast, from Kharqu and Kharaq in the north to Hormoz and Larak in the south, were rightly Persian, though many were in the hands of Arab tribes&quot;. Consistent with this, the British in 1800 were also of the belief that &quot;[a]lthough the King exercises no positive authority over any of the islands of the Persian Gulf, those on the northern shore are all considered as part of the Empire&quot;.

An 1804 map of German origin showed the southern coast of Iran as the habitat of the &quot;Bani Hule&quot; tribe and the islands, coloured in the same orange, were designated as &quot;Thunb unbenohul&quot;. The &quot;Bani Hule&quot; or Howalla were a loosely defined grouping of peoples of distant Arab origin but with longstanding residence on the Iranian coast. Regardless of the spelling of the toponym as &quot;Tonb&quot;, be it from the Arabic tÂonb (abode) or from the Persian tonb (hill), the attribution to the larger island of this epithet highlighted the islands&#x27; intimate association with the Persian coast and its inhabitants. One of the clans belonging to the Howalla or &quot;Bani Hule&quot; of the Persian coast was that of the Qasimi. Their Arab tribal origins are not as clearly established as is, however, their Persian geographical origin immediately prior to their rise to notoriety in the lower Persian Gulf. This occurred in the 18th century.

===18th century===
During the 1720s, the Qasami had emigrated from the Persian coast and established themselves as a force in Sharjah and Julfar (Ras al-Khaimah, now part of UAE). In the period 1747–59, a branch of the Qasemi from Sharjah established itself on the Persian littoral, but it was expelled in 1767. By 1780, the Qasemi branch was re-established on the Persian coast and began to feud with other coastal tribes over pasturage in the islands off Langeh. The Iranian argument for the ownership of the disputed islands is that the Qasami controlled the islands while they were located on the Persian coast, not when they later emigrated to the UAE coast. In April 1873, the islands were reported as a dependency of the Persian Fars province to the British Resident, which the Resident acknowledged. In the period 1786–1835 the official British opinion, surveys, and maps identified the Tonbs as part of Langeh, subject to the government of the province of Fars. Chief among them were the works of Lt. John McCluer (1786), political counselor John Macdonald Kinneir (1813), and Lt. George Barns Brucks (1829).

===19th century===

In 1835, the Bani Yas attacked a British ship off Greater Tonb. In the ensuing maritime peace arranged by the British Political Resident Samuel Hennell, a restrictive line was established between Abu Musa and Sirri islands, and pledges were obtained from the tribes of the lower Persian Gulf not to venture their war boats north of the line. In view of Sirri and Abu Musa being pirate lairs themselves, Hennell&#x27;s successor, Major James Morrison, in January 1836, modified the restrictive line to run from Sham on the Trucial Coast to a point ten miles south of Abu Musa to Sáir Abu Noayr island. In either of its configurations, the restrictive line placed the Tonbs outside of the reach of the war boats of the Qasemi, Bani Yas, and other tribes of the lower Persian Gulf. The 1835 maritime truce was made permanent in 1853 after a series of earlier extensions. Force being no longer a viable option for settlement of disputes, especially on the part of the Qasemi of the lower Persian Gulf, the enforcement of Qasemi&#x27;s claims to islands such as Abu Musa and Greater Tonb became a subject for the British colonial administration in the Persian Gulf. In that context, the Resident and its agents on several occasions (1864, 1873, 1879, 1881) had been seized with the question of the ownership of the Tonbs, but the British government had refused to go along with the claims of the Qasemi of the lower Persian Gulf.

In the period 1836–86, the official British surveys, maps, and administrative reports continued to identify the Tonbs as part of Langeh, subject to the government of Fars province. Among them were the works of Lt. Colonel Robert Taylor (1836), the Resident A.B. Kemball (1854), the Resident Lewis Pelly (1864), The Persian Gulf Pilot (1864), an admiralty publication, the 1870 (second) edition of The Persian Gulf Pilot, and the 1886 Map of Persia, which was issued by the intelligence branch of the British war office and showed the Tonbs in the colour of Persia.

Until this date (1886), the British acknowledged Persian ownership of the islands. In February 1887, the Persian central government reorganised the ports of Bushehr, Langeh, and Bandar Abbas, together with their dependent districts and islands, into a new administrative unit called the Persian Gulf Ports and placed it under the charge of a member of the Qajar royal family, dissolving the Qasami governorship later in September. These and other Persian actions prompted the British to change their stance on the ownership of the islands due to suspicion that the new Persian policy was influenced by German and Russian interests. By August 1888, Britain decided to acquiesce in the Persian actions on Sirri, leaving alone the concerns over Tonb, even though the Persian government&#x27;s rebuff of the British protests had coupled their claim to Sirri with one to Tonb). The British regard for the Persian claim to Sirri (and perhaps Tonb) was affected significantly by the depiction of the Tonbs and Serri in the same colour as that of Persia in the 1886 Map of Persia, which Naser-al-Din Shah Qajar of Persia now astutely cited against the British when they protested the Persian actions on Sirri. The British acquiescence in the Persian claim to Serri demeaned the very theory on which the protest had been based.

The Qasemi administrators of Langa were of the same original stock as the Qasemi of the lower Persian Gulf; however, their rise on the Persian littoral and to the political administration of Langa and its dependencies were attributable primarily to their distance from the politics and piratical activities of their kinsmen in Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah . Consequently, when the British government pacified the tribes of the lower Persian Gulf, which it had labelled as &quot;pirates&quot; (hence the term &quot;Pirate Coast&quot;) in a series of naval engagements in the early 19th century, and then exacted from them a general surrender in 1820 and a maritime truce in the 1830s (hence the term &quot;Trucial&quot; Shaikhdoms), the Qasemi of the Persian coast were spared the ravages and humiliation suffered by their namesake in the lower Persian Gulf. The view that the Qasemi of Langeh had administered the Tonbs, Abu Musa, and Serri islands as the lieutenants of the Qasemi of the lower Persian Gulf was rebutted in later years by a legal adviser at the British foreign office in 1932 and the head of its eastern department in 1934.

Besides the Persian territorial and political ambitions in the Persian Gulf, in the period 1888–1903 the British government was worried equally about French intrigues, and Russian and German naval and economic interests in the region. It had already been determined by the British that the Persian actions on Sirri and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf were inspired by Russia. In pursuit of a forward policy based on Curzon&#x27;s views, which included the marking of the territories under their direct and indirect colonial control, the British government undertook a project to erect flagstaffs in a number of locations in the Persian Gulf.

In the pursuit of British imperial considerations, the lack of regard for Persian sensibilities was no problem. Already, in 1901, a British government memorandum openly suggested that, where strategic necessity required, Britain would seize any of the Persian islands, and in March 1902 Curzon recommended that the British navy hoist a flag on Qeshm island in the case of necessity. On June 14, 1904, the Persian government removed its presence from Abu Musa and Greater Tonb subject to the reservations, as reported by the British minister. In a note to the British minister, the Persian foreign minister stated that neither party should hoist flags in the islands until the settlement of the question of ownership, but the sheikh of Sharjah hoisted their flags three days later. In the Iranian annals of the diplomatic history of the Tonbs and Abu Musa, the Persian agreement to withdraw from the islands on 14 June 1904, subject to reservations, is known as the &quot;status quo agreement.&quot; The re-flagging of the islands by Sharjah three days after the withdrawal of the Persians violated the status quo agreement, rendering moot the legal relevance of any subsequent presence and activity by Sharjah on the islands and also any by Ras al-Khaimah with respect to the Tonbs from 1921 onward.

===20th century===
During the 20th century, several attempts at negotiations were made. On 29 November 1971, shortly before the end of the British protectorate and the formation of the UAE, Iran seized semi-control of Abu Musa under an agreement of joint administration together with Sharjah, with both sides nominally upholding their separate claims. A day later, on 30 November 1971, Iran forcibly seized control of the Tunb Islands and Abu Musa, against the resistance of the tiny Arab police force stationed there. The Iranians were instructed not to open fire, and the first shots came from the Arab resistance which killed four Iranian marines and injured one. In his book &quot;Territorial foundations of the Gulf states&quot;, Schofield states that according to some sources, the Arab civilian population of Greater Tunb of about 120 was then deported to Ras Al Khaimah, but according to other sources the island had already been uninhabited for some time.

===Present situation===
Shortly after the Iranian seizure, there would be a failed coup in Sharjah led by the Arab nationalist former Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi in part due to the UAE&#x27;s response to the seizure.

In the following decades, the issue remained a source of friction between the Arab states and Iran. The Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf repeatedly declared support for the UAE claims. Bilateral talks between the UAE and Iran in 1992 failed. The UAE have attempted to bring the dispute before the International Court of Justice, but Iran refuses to do so. Tehran says the islands always belonged to it as it had never renounced possession of the islands, and that they are an integral part of Iranian territory. The emirate of Ras al-Khaimah argue that the islands were under the control of Qasimi sheikhs, a branch of which administered the port of Bandar Lengeh for the Persian government from ca. 1789 to 1887, and UAE as the successor to the tribal patrimony of the tribe, may inherit their rights. Iran counters by stating that the local Qasimi rulers during a crucial part of the previous centuries were actually based on the Iranian, not the Arab, coast, and had thus has been Persian subjects. The UAE refers to the islands as &quot;occupied&quot;.

Currently, these two islands are among the territories under the control and government of Iran, and the Iranian government has established naval military bases on these islands to control the Strait of Hormuz.

<doc id="931827" wikidata="Q3305274" url="?curid=931827" title="Richard Court">
<text>Richard Fairfax Court (born 27 September 1947) is a former Australian politician and diplomat. He served as Premier of Western Australia from 1993 to 2001 and as Australian Ambassador to Japan from 2017 to 2020. A member of the Liberal Party, he represented the Perth-area electorate of Nedlands in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1982 to 2001. His father, Sir Charles Court, also served as state premier.

==Early life==
Court was born into a political family. His father, Sir Charles Court, was the previous member for Nedlands (1953–1982) and served as Premier from 1974 to 1982. His older brother Barry Court was president of the Pastoralists&#x27; and Graziers&#x27; Association, married Margaret Court, and became President of the Liberal Party of Western Australia in March 2008.

Richard Court was educated at Hale School and graduated from the University of Western Australia with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1968. He subsequently spent a year as a management trainee at Ford Motor Company in the United States, and on his return to Western Australia, operated a number of businesses including food retailing and the manufacture, wholesale and retail of marine and boating equipment.

As an 18 Foot Skiff sailor in the mid 1970s, he combined the concepts of trapezing with the sliding plank (as used on the International Canoe) into a sliding rack. This feature increased righting moment, sail carrying power, and ultimately boat speed. The concept was simplified into fixed wings, rapidly adopted by the rest of the 18 ft skiff fleet, and now ubiquitous in sailing skiffs.

==Political career==
In March 1982, at a by-election upon the retirement of his father from politics, Court was elected to represent his father&#x27;s seat of Nedlands, located in Perth&#x27;s wealthy beachside suburbs, in the state legislature. His time as a government backbencher was short-lived, however, as the opposition Labor Party and its charismatic leader, Brian Burke, won the 1983 state election. Court was elevated to the shadow frontbench in 1984, serving as the opposition spokesman for Resources and Industrial Development, Mines and Aboriginal Affairs. He became deputy leader of the Liberal Party in September 1987, serving under Barry MacKinnon, and became leader in 1992.
Court ousted MacKinnon as leader by a vote of 20 to 12.

In February 1993, a state election brought the Liberal Party and their coalition partner, the Nationals, to power with a stable majority following revelations from the WA Inc royal commission examining deals made with businessmen such as Alan Bond and Laurie Connell by Labor governments during the 1980s.

The Court government was comfortably re-elected in the 1996 WA State election. The Liberals actually won a majority in their own right (29 seats out of 57) for the first time ever, but Court opted to retain the coalition with the Nationals. However, Court&#x27;s popularity suffered in his second term as Premier due to scandals, including deals made between the government and the Premier&#x27;s brother, Ken Court, as well as the finance broking scandal, where many elderly investors lost their savings and an inquiry found the Government ineffective and inefficient in managing the industry. Also important was the continued logging of old growth forests in the South West of Western Australia. A rejuvenated Labor Party, led since 1996 by Dr Geoff Gallop, won the state election on 10 February 2001 on a 13-seat, 7-point swing—a shift in voter sympathies not seen since the 1911 state election.

===Departure from politics===
On 14 February 2001, a few days after losing the election, Court refused to resign and endorse his long-serving deputy leader and factional rival Colin Barnett as Leader of the Opposition—defying media predictions by announcing he would stay for up to eight years. Court was from the conservative wing of the WA Liberals, while Barnett was from the moderate wing. He said he intended to continue in the role as other well-known contenders for party leadership had lost their seats at the election. Political commentator Matt Price described the decision to stay on as &quot;insanity&quot;, although allowed for the possibility Court&#x27;s main reason for staying on was to thwart the plans of his &quot;barely tolerated deputy&quot; by buying time for another contender. Initially, Barnett did not nominate for any position ahead of 21 February party room ballot, but on 19 February, announced he would stand against Court for the leadership, saying that party renewal was necessary.
On the morning of the ballot, Liberal MPs and the public learned of a reported &quot;backroom deal&quot; brokered by Western Australian party president David Johnston to install federal MP Julie Bishop as state Liberal leader. Under this plan, Barnett and Court would both resign their seats. Barnett would have been offered Bishop&#x27;s seat of Curtin, the safest federal seat in the Perth area. Bishop would contest the resulting by-election in either Nedlands or Barnett&#x27;s seat of Cottesloe (both of which were within Curtin&#x27;s boundaries, and are reckoned as comfortably safe Liberal seats). Court would hand over the party leadership to Bishop once she was safely in state parliament. The plan was announced on the front page of &quot;The West Australian&quot; in a story by editor Brian Rogers, which reported that Barnett had been &quot;sounded out about the plan&quot;. However, Barnett stated he &quot;choked on his Weet-Bix&quot; as he read details of the plan in the newspaper, describing it as &quot;an act of treachery&quot;. Many other Liberal MPs had also not heard of the plan before the story. Despite this, Court won the ballot 17–13 against Barnett during a four-hour party-room meeting, with Dan Sullivan being elected as his deputy. By 23 February, the plan had to be scrapped when Bishop, who had never formally committed to the plan, rejected it. Court was now in an untenable position, and was forced to retire from politics the next day, with Barnett taking the leadership in the ensuing party room ballot in which he defeated Rod Sweetman.
Court had disputes with the Keating Government over Mabo.

==Post-political life==
On 9 June 2003, Richard Court was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). The award cited &quot;[his] service to the Western Australian Parliament and to the community, particularly the Indigenous community, and in the areas of child health research and cultural heritage and to economic development through negotiating major resource projects including the export of gas to China furthering the interests of the nation as a whole.&quot;

In November 2016, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop announced that Court would be appointed as Australian Ambassador to Japan in &quot;early 2017&quot;. On 11 April 2017, he presented credentials to Emperor Akihito at Imperial Palace in Tokyo. In October 2020 it was announced that Jan Adams would replace Court as Ambassador to Japan.

<text>Leonid Maksimovich Leonov (; — 8 August 1994) was a Soviet novelist and playwright of socialist realism. His works have been compared with Dostoevsky&#x27;s deep psychological torment.

==Early life==
Leonov was born in Moscow in 1899. His father, Maksim Leonov, was a self-educated peasant poet who was at one time the chairman of the Surikov Literary and Musical circle (Surikov was also of peasant origin). Maksim Leonov later joined the Sreda literary group of Moscow, which counted Maxim Gorky, Leonid Andreyev, and Ivan Bunin among its members.

Leonov&#x27;s earliest memory was of 1905, when Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia was assassinated by the terrorist Kalyayev. In the same year, Leonov&#x27;s father was arrested for two pamphlets that he had published. Leonov was taken twice by his grandmother to visit his father in prison. After serving 20 months, Maksim Leonov was exiled to Arkhangelsk. Leonov visited him there several times, and his impressions and observations were later reflected in many of his works, especially &quot;Sot&quot;.

He attended the Moscow Third gymnasium from 1910 to 1918. His first poems, reviews, and news reports were published in 1915 in the journal &quot;Severnoe Utro&quot;. He had intended to study medicine at Moscow State University, but his plans were disrupted by the outbreak of the Russian Civil War.

==Career==
During the Russian Civil War, Leonov worked as a reporter with the Red Army. He was released from the Red Army in 1921 in order to continue his education. At that time, he planned to study painting. Upon returning to Moscow, he was unable to find any of his close relatives and acquaintances, but he was eventually accepted into the home of his uncle, a locksmith named Vasilyev. Leonov worked in his uncle&#x27;s shop voluntarily in order to repay his uncle for taking him in. Later, the famous graphic artist Falilyev took an interest in him. Falilyev introduced him to some well-known literary figures and artists of the early 20s, including the publishers Solomon Kopelman (of the Shipovnik Publishing House), and Sergei Sabashnikov. After seeing some of his early stories, they both offered to publish them. This was the beginning of Leonov&#x27;s professional literary career. Among his first stories were &quot;Buryga&quot; and &quot;The Wooden Queen&quot; (1923).

His first (and perhaps best) novel, &quot;The Badgers&quot; (1924), employs a fairly conventional style but is filled with peasant speech; it &quot;deals with the impact on the village and the peasantry of the Revolution and symbolically pits brother against brother in the struggle.&quot; His dark novel &quot;The Thief&quot; (1927), set in the criminal underworld of the Russian capital, was warmly welcomed by critics in Russia and abroad, but Brown considers it &quot;spoiled in execution by the self-conscious literary poses of the author and his transparent derivation of himself from the irrationalist Dostoevsky. Leonov nonetheless performs a shrewd psychological dissection upon his main character, a disillusioned commissar who has become a member of a gang of thieves. He produced a thoroughly reworked version of this novel in 1959.&quot;

He married Tatayana Mikhailovna Sabashnikova in 1926; the couple had two daughters. He visited Maxim Gorky in Sorrento in 1927. The Moscow Art Theatre under the direction of Konstantin Stanislavski staged Leonov&#x27;s play &quot;Untilovsk&quot;, which was set in a remote Siberian community. The production opened on 17 February 1928, having given a preview to the theatre&#x27;s management committee three days earlier. Both the committee and the wider press disapproved of the play&#x27;s ideological stance; Anatoly Lunacharsky, writing in the Leningrad journal &quot;Krasnaia&quot;, described it as a step backwards for the theatre.

&quot;Soviet River&quot; (1930) describes the construction of a paper mill on the banks of a river in the middle of the Siberian forest; &quot;Skutarevsky&quot; (1932), &quot;probably one of his best works in style and intellectual power, explores the psychological problems of an eminent scientist working in a socialist state and, in what is undoubtedly an autobiographical statement, traces his development from a skeptical critic of the new order into an enthusiastic supporter.&quot; In 1934, Leonov helped Maxim Gorky to found the Union of Soviet Writers. The following year, he published a fantasy about the Soviet future, &quot;Road to the Ocean&quot;, in which the hero, &quot;another embodiment of Leonov, meditates on the suffering he has caused and endured and tries to answer the question whether it was worth while in the total economy of history.&quot;

Immediately after the start of World War II, Leonov penned several patriotic plays, which were quickly made into movies and won him the Stalin Prize (1943). His novel &quot;The Russian Forest&quot; (1953) was acclaimed by the authorities as a model Soviet book on World War II and received the Lenin Prize, but its implication that the Soviet regime had cut down &quot;the symbol of Old Russian culture&quot; caused some nervousness, and Nikita Khrushchev reminded the author that &quot;not all trees are useful ... from time to time the forest must be thinned.&quot; In 1945, Leonov served as a correspondent for &quot;Pravda&quot; at the Nuremberg trials. He was elected as a Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1950. In 1967, Leonov was named a Hero of Socialist Labour. He was admitted to the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union five years later. During the last decades of his life, he worked upon the dark nationalistic-religious epic &quot;The Pyramid&quot; (1994).

Korney Chukovsky described Leonov as follows in his diary entry for 21 August 1946:
I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of Leonid Leonov and admire his splendid character. He&#x27;s a strong man, well armed for life. He visits once or twice a week and talks nonstop, but never brings up his own plans, projects, or triumphs. The Maly is premiering a play of his tomorrow, say, or he had a book come out yesterday—he&#x27;ll talk for three hours and never breathe a word of it. Not only is there no hint of the braggart in him, he goes on and on about his failures and defeats. He can do anything with his hands: he makes lampshades, tables, and chairs; he molds faces out of clay; he has fashioned a magnificent cigarette lighter out of bronze—he has all kinds of instruments and tools. Watch the way he handles seeds or berries and you know he&#x27;s got a green thumb. Simple as he looks, he plays his cards close to the chest. He is well-bred and well-organized, oddly lacking in kindness but a thoroughbred, and he has a poetic nature. In short, he&#x27;s a typical Russian.

<text>GZR was an American heavy metal band founded by and named after Black Sabbath bassist/lyricist Geezer Butler. The band has been marketed with three different names on different releases, g//z/r in 1995, geezer in 1997, and GZR in 2005. Most fans refer to the band as &quot;geezer&quot;, although Butler himself refers to the band name as &quot;gee-zed-R&quot;. This incarnation of the band is not to be confused with Butler&#x27;s previous attempt in 1985 to form a solo band, then known as the Geezer Butler Band – the two outfits are largely unrelated.

== History ==
The band&#x27;s music is generally of a much harder edge than Butler is known for in Black Sabbath. This is not a surprise, as the vocalist on his first album (&quot;Plastic Planet&quot;) was Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory, who is known for more driving and harder edged vocals than ever was displayed in Black Sabbath. Before taking on Bell as vocalist for the debut album &quot;Plastic Planet&quot;, Butler contacted Devin Townsend to perform vocals. However, due to Townsend&#x27;s recent stint with Steve Vai, where he had not been a lyricist, he was unwilling to enter into another band where he would have no lyrical input. &quot;Plastic Planet&quot; also featured Pedro Howse, Butler&#x27;s nephew, on guitars, as well as Deen Castronovo (later of Journey) on drums. Bell did not stay with the band past the recording of &quot;Plastic Planet&quot;, due to Fear Factory commitments.

In 1996, the band re-emerged with an exclusive track for the &quot;Mortal Kombat: More Kombat&quot; compilation titled &quot;Outworld&quot;, featuring Anger on Anger vocalist Mario Frasca. This proved to be a one-time collaboration as Frasca was replaced by Clark Brown from the band Symatic for GZR&#x27;s second album, &quot;Black Science&quot;, released in 1997. The GZR formation played a few live dates in 1996 and 1997 behind the release of the album, however, this was not a full-fledged tour, as most of the gigs were played concurrent to the Ozzfest tour of that year, including some dates with Deen Castronovo. Three songs from a 1996 concert in Detroit are included as bonus tracks on the Japanese pressing of Plastic Planet. Live tracks are also included on Geezer Butler’s boxed set Manipulations of the Mind. The band opened for musicians like Bruce Dickinson who was playing some live gigs at the time. Castronovo was replaced on drums by Chad Smith (not to be confused with the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer with the same name).

<text>Ellen Cashman (1845 – 4 January 1925) was an Irish gold prospector, nurse, restaurateur, businesswoman and philanthropist in Arizona, Alaska, British Columbia and Yukon.

Cashman led a rescue party to miners to the Cassiar Country gold mine in the Cassiar Mountains of British Columbia. In Tombstone, Arizona, Cashman raised money to build the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, and did charitable work with the Sisters of St. Joseph. She went to the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush for gold prospecting, working there until 1905. She became nationally known as a frontierswoman, with the &quot;Associated Press&quot; covering a later trip. A devout Catholic, she raised funds for hospitals, schools, and churches wherever she settled. Her heroics and charity gained her the names the &quot;Angel of Cassiar,&quot; the &quot;Angel of Tombstone,&quot; and the &quot;Saint of the Sourdoughs.&quot;

In 2006, Cashman was inducted into the Alaska Mining Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Ellen &quot;Nellie&quot; O&#x27;Kissane was born in County Cork in the mid 1840s to Frances and Patrick O&#x27;Kissane. Their surname was later anglicized to Cashman. Some sources give 1844 as her year of birth, while some other research indicates she was the Ellen Cashman baptised on 15 October 1845. The exact location of her birth is uncertain; she was either born in Belvelly or in Middleton (now Midleton), which has claimed her as a &quot;native daughter.&quot; Her family lived on Free School Lane (now known as Mc Donaghs Lane). After Nellie was born, the Cashmans had another, Frances (known as Fanny). Likely while Fanny was still a baby, Patrick Cashman died. This was possibly due to starvation or another disease related to the Great Famine (Ireland). Between 1850 and 1852 (sources vary), the Cashmans immigrated to the United States, settling first in Boston.

As an adolescent, Cashman worked as a bellhop in a Boston hotel. She also served as an elevator operator. One story notes that during the Civil War, she overheard a conversation while operating an elevator in Washington, DC. Nellie reported the conversation, contributing to the Union victory.

In 1865 or 1866, Cashman and her family moved to San Francisco, California. Nellie and her mother likely moved to Virginia City, Nevada in 1870, where Nellie briefly worked as a camp cook. They later moved to Pioche, Nevada, where they purchased the Miner&#x27;s Boarding House. Nellie quickly took over managerial duties from her mother. This time gave Nellie her later sobriquet, Nellie Pioche. Nellie and her mother travelled to San Francisco, where Frances settled. In 1874, Cashman joined a group of prospectors from Nevada. They tossed a coin to decide if they would travel to South Africa or British Columbia, ultimately deciding to go to British Columbia.

==British Columbia==
Cashman left her family home in 1874 for the Cassiar Country in British Columbia. She set up a boarding house for miners at Telegraph Creek, asking for donations to the Sisters of St Anne in return for the services available at her boarding house. For the first time, Cashman became a miner herself. She used the talk in her boarding house to purchase promising claims at good times and learned elementary mining techniques and geology. She also invested in other prospectors.

Cashman was travelling to Victoria to deliver 500 dollars to the sisters of St. Anne when she heard that a snowstorm had descended on the Cassiar Mountains, stranding and injuring 26 miners, who were also suffering from scurvy. She took charge of a six-man search party and collected food and medicine to take to the stranded miners. Conditions in the Cassiar Mountains were so dangerous that the Canadian Army advised against attempting the rescue. The snow was too deep for dogs, so the group used snow shoes to walk with the 1,500 pounds (680) kilograms of food they had brought. During one avalanche, Cashman was deeply buried, but dug her way out.

Upon learning of Cashman&#x27;s expedition, a commander sent his troops to locate her party and bring them to safety. An army trooper eventually found Cashman camped on the frozen surface of the Stikine River. Cashman refused their escort back. After 77 days of harsh weather, Cashman and her party located the sick men, who numbered far more than 26. Some historical accounts credit Cashman with saving the lives of as many as 75 men. She administered a diet containing Vitamin C to restore the men to health. When the men improved, Cashman reopened her boarding house, which prospered. She was afterward fondly known in the region as the &quot;Angel of the Cassiar&quot;.

By 1876, there was considerably less production from Cassiar prospecting. Cashman left Cassiar for good. She went to Victoria again to deliver $543 to the Sisters of St Anne, which helped fund St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital. She then went on to San Francisco, where her mother and sister still lived.

==Arizona==

In 1879, Cashman left California to travel to Tucson, Arizona. She opened the Delmonico Restaurant (likely named after New York establishment). In Tucson, she befriended newspaperman John Clum.

Around 1880, Cashman moved to Tombstone, Arizona. She opened The Nevada Boot &amp; Shoe store, likely selling products from her brother-in-law&#x27;s factory. The store also sold other goods, including clothing and furnishing goods, cigars, and tobacco. She later opened another business, the Tombstone Cash Store. This store, which she opened with a friend, sold groceries and other provisions. The store was successful and Cashman bought out her friend. By 1881, Cashman was also leasing the Arcade Restaurant.

In 1880, Cashman began raising money to build the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, which opened the next year. She also became the treasurer of the Miners&#x27; Hospital Association and brought three Sisters of Mercy from Tucson to attend to the miners. Cashman committed herself to charity work with the Sisters of St. Joseph, taking a position as a nurse in a Cochise County hospital. When an epidemic swept Tombstone, she, along with local prostitute &quot;Black Jack,&quot; nursed the sick at Russ House. Cashman also supported Irish causes, particularly the Irish National Land League. Further, she organized support for one of the first Tombstone schools.

Cashman briefly leased the Bisbee Hotel, but was unsuccessful, as Bisbee was not yet flourishing. She quickly returned to Tombstone.

Cashman&#x27;s sister Fanny Cunningham was widowed in 1881. Cashman arranged for Fanny and her five children to join her in Tombstone. The sisters leased a boarding house, made extensive renovations, and opened Delmonico Lodging. A fire at the boarding house, which the community was able to quickly put out, led Cashman to gain the legend of being able to stop an advancing fire. Around this time, Cashman and her associate Joseph Pascholy purchased and ran a restaurant and hotel in called Russ House, which was later named after Cashman. One story notes Doc Holliday defending her cooking to a disgruntled Russ House customer.

In December 1881, Cashman sold her half of Russ House so she could care for Fanny, who was showing signs of tuberculosis. Fanny also sold Delmonico&#x27;s lodging. While Cashman continued to buy and sell mining claims, she devoted herself to caring for her sister, nieces, and nephews. In 1882, Fanny&#x27;s tuberculosis went into remission. The sisters opened a new hotel, The American, which hosted a twenty-four hour dining room. Cashman also re-purchased the Russ House.

In 1883, Cashman led a group of miners (including Milt Joyce and Marcus A. Smith) to Baja, where gold had been discovered. She and five or six of the party went ahead as a reconnoitering party, but quickly were endangered by the harsh desert conditions. One legend claims that Cashman met a priest, who begged her not to disclose the gold near his parish for the sake of his community. Another claims that an angel guided her to a mission, where Cashman was able to obtain supplies, saving her companions. They reunited with the larger party and travelled to Trinidad Bay to arrange for a boat. When the boat captain appeared on deck drunkly deluded, some of the prospectors tied him up to sleep it off. When they arrived in Guaymas, the prospectors and crew were arrested for imprisoning the captain, but were rescued a few days later by the American consul.

Cashman returned to Tombstone, where she resumed running her businesses. Fanny, health declining, moved to San Diego to be nursed by nuns until she died in July 1884. Cashman took up caring for her nieces and nephews, aged three to thirteen, and her mother. She supported the children&#x27;s education, sending them away to religious institutions for further education. One of Cashman&#x27;s nephews, Mike, attended college in Los Angeles and Santa Fe, becoming prominent in Cochise County. Mike named a daughter Ellen in honor of Cashman. Similarly, one of Cashman&#x27;s nieces, upon becoming a nun, took on the name Sister St. Helena in tribute to Cashman.

In December 1883, bandits committed the Bisbee massacre in Tombstone, killing four innocent bystanders and wounding two others in the course of a robbery. The five men were convicted and sentenced to die by hanging on 28 March 1884. The &quot;Tombstone Epitaph&quot; reported that Cashman was in &quot;constant attendance&quot; at the jail, where she joined clergy in visiting the men. When a local businessman constructed bleachers and sold tickets to the hanging, Cashman asked the sheriff to intervene and take down the bleachers. Although he refused to, local miners, possibly instigated by Cashman&#x27;s request, tore down the bleachers the night before the execution. The hangings proceeded as scheduled, but out of public view. John Clum reported that Cashman&#x27;s spiritual counsel converted the three non-Catholics in their last days. When Cashman learned that a medical school planned to exhume the bodies of the convicts for study, she enlisted two prospectors to stand watch over the Boot Hill Cemetery for 10 days.

Another legend claims that Cashman learning the local mine superintendent was to be kidnapped and possibly hanged by protesting miners, quickly drove him out of town. He went to Tucson until things had calmed.

As Tombstone quieted as the city died, Cashman sold claims and only ran the Russ House for some time, caring for her family.

In 1886, Cashman left Tombstone. She moved around over the next several years. She looked at claims around the country. She opened and closed restaurants and boardinghouses and sold supplies in Nogales, Tucson, Kingston, New Mexico, Harquahala, Globe, and Yuma. Her restaurant in Kingston was particularly notable as some biographers claim she hired oil tycoon Ed Doheny as a dishwasher. In Harquahala, she may have become close to marrying Mike Sullivan, who had discovered gold in the area. Her prospecting brought her to Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and possibly South Africa.

==Yukon and Alaska==
In 1898, Cashman left Arizona for the Yukon in search of gold. She likely arrived in Dawson City that April as one of the first stampeders to settle there. As an unmarried woman, Cashman was unable to purchase unestablished claims. However, she was able to obtain several claims. Cashman was one of the few women in Dawson to work her own claims. In 1898, she opened a restaurant, Delmonico, to finance her mining. She also established another restaurant, the Cassiar, a room called The Prospector&#x27;s Haven of Retreat (meant to provide an alternative to saloons and gambling), and purchased a grocery store. Her nephew Tom joined her in Dawson and helped at the restaurant and her claims. She continued her charitable work in Dawson, raising funds for the local hospital to expand. While in the Yukon, Cashman was involved in several legal disputes. Notably, one involved Belinda Mulrooney. Cashman had several health problems while in Dawson, including a major surgery and a multi-month hospital stay.

Cashman&#x27;s prospecting ventures took her to Klondike, Fairbanks and Nolan Creek in Yukon-Koyukuk County, Alaska. In 1904, she settled in Fairbanks, where she opened a successful grocery and miners&#x27; supply store and raised funds for the local hospital. Memoirist Clara Heinz Burke recalled that Cashman would raise funds by waiting at a saloon until a gambling jackpot was large, sweep the funds off the table, and tell the gamblers that if they had funds to gamble, they had the means to donate the money to the hospital.

In 1905, Cashman settled in Koyukuk, Alaska, along with other established miners. At one point, she owned eleven mines there. During the winters, Cashman travelled visit family and friends and do work in Dawson, Fairbanks, Seattle, California, and Arizona. She would then return to Koyukuk, where she had made her home. In 1921, Cashman travelled south to attempt to raise funds for the machines needed for mining. The next year, she created the Midnight Sun Mining Company to raise funds for the machinery. Looking for further investments, the seventy-seven year old Cashman travelled to Anchorage by dog team, aiming to eventually go to Florida to meet with an investor.

In January 1925, Cashman fell ill. She was admitted to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Fairbanks, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia and rheumatism. She was sent to Seattle and, realizing her illness, asked to be sent to the Sisters of St. Anne, the same hospital which she had helped to build fifty-one years earlier. She died there, and was interred at Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia. As news of her death spread, obituaries were published in newspapers in mining towns like Dawson, Fairbanks, and Tombstone, as well as in leading papers like the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle.

<text>The Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (; Municipal Museum Amsterdam), colloquially known as the Stedelijk, is a museum for modern art, contemporary art, and design located in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The 19th-century building was designed by Adriaan Willem Weissman and the 21st century wing with the current entrance was designed by Benthem Crouwel Architects. It is located at the Museum Square in the borough Amsterdam South, where it is close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Concertgebouw.

The collection comprises modern and contemporary art and design from the early 20th century up to the 21st century. It features artists such as Vincent van Gogh, Wassily Kandinsky, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Karel Appel, Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning, Marlene Dumas, Lucio Fontana, and Gilbert &amp; George.

In 2015, the museum had an estimated 675,000 visitors.

==History==

===19th century===

The Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, opened on 14 September 1895 as an initiative of the local authority and private individuals. The Dutch Neo-Renaissance style museum building was designed by Dutch architect as part of a modernization project spearheaded by local citizens starting in 1850. The construction of the building was largely funded in 1890 by Sophia Adriana de Bruyn. Specifically, it was built under the Vereeniging tot het Vormen van een Verzameling van Hedendaagsche Kunst (VVHK, Society for the formation of a public collection of contemporary art), which was founded in 1874, to house de Bruyn&#x27;s collection of art and antiques that she donated to the city along with a considerable sum of money. The Van Eeghen family also contributed to the construction costs and donated paintings from the collection of Christiaan Pieter van Eeghen. The building was constructed between 1891 and 1895 at Paulus Potterstraat, a short walking distance from the Rijksmuseum. The museum&#x27;s original collection included militaria of the Amsterdam militia, Asiatic art, and artifacts from the Museum of Chronometry and the Medical-Pharmaceutical Museum.

===20th century===
In 1905, Cornelis Baard was appointed curator of the Stedelijk and promoted to museum director in 1920. During his time as curator, the local authority began building its own collection of modern art. The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to municipal cutbacks and an increased need for policy reviews in the first half of the 1930s. In 1932, a purchasing committee was established with two members from the VVHK and two from the local authority. These four figures oversaw all art purchases for the museum, notably works of Hague and Amsterdam Impressionism and pieces by international contemporaries.

The museum began actively acquiring art in 1930. In 1933, M.B.B. Nijkerk&#x27;s collection of books came to the Stedelijk, which was later expanded to include aesthetic book design and typography. The Museum of Applied Art opened on the ground floor of the west wing on 15 December 1934. This collection included furniture, glass, pottery, and china, graphic design and posters, textiles, small sculptures and masks, batik, metalwork, and stained glass with an emphasis on Dutch work from around the turn of the century.

In 1936, David Röell, who had previously worked at the Rijksmuseum and was secretary of the VVHK, took over as museum director. Röell appointed Willem Sandberg as the new curator in January 1938. Sandberg eventually took over as director of the museum in 1945. By 1962, the VVHK handed over most of its collection, including works by George Hendrik Breitner, Paul Cézanne, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, Vincent van Gogh, and Johan Jongkind.

Under the direction of Sandberg, the Stedelijk started a department of applied art in 1945 and a department of prints and drawings in 1954. At the start of 1950, the Stedelijk also began to present modern music. In 1952, it became host to the newly established Nederlands Filmmuseum, and started showing films. The annex known as the Sandberg Wing was built in 1954 to accommodate experimental art. By 1956, a reading room, print room, a museum restaurant and garden, and a new auditorium for film screenings and musical performances were added. Sandberg acquired a group of works by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich in 1958. In the same year, Sandberg began acquiring photography for the museum&#x27;s collection; the Stedelijk was the first western European museum for modern art to collect photography. The collection includes seminal photographers of both the Dutch and international avant-garde in the interbellum period (such as Erwin Blumenfeld, László Moholy-Nagy and Man Ray), an extensive selection of post-war Dutch photographers (including Eva Besnyö, Ed van der Elsken and Cas Oorthuys), artist portraits, photojournalism, and autonomous fine art photography from the 1970s onward.

During World War II, the Stedelijk collection and that of the Amsterdam Museum were transferred for safekeeping to a bunker in the sand-hills near Santpoort. Museum staff took turns keeping watch. Sandberg narrowly managed to evade arrest: in 1943, when a German search party was sent to apprehend him, Sandberg fled by bicycle into the dunes. Despite the upheavals of war, the Stedelijk continued to hold exhibitions.

Works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Henri Matisse were added to the collection at the end of the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, the Stedelijk also acquired artworks by De Stijl and related international movements such as Russian Constructivism and Bauhaus.
Edy de Wilde, who had run the Van Abbe Museum in Eindhoven, took over as director from 1963 to 1985. He began the first collection of American contemporary art at the Stedelijk. Under his direction, in 1971, debates about the museum&#x27;s social and educational functions sparked the formation of a communications department. In the early 1970s, the museum made its first acquisitions of video art by European artists including Dibbets and Gilbert &amp; George. Today, the collection of video art contains around 900 works and installations, including works by Nam June Paik, Bill Viola and Bruce Nauman. By the mid-1970s, after the last period rooms were closed, the Stedelijk became exclusively a museum for modern art.

===21st century===
In 2001, drawings by Kazimir Malevich and other Russian avant-garde artists from the collection of the Khardzhiev-Chaga Cultural Centre were added to the museum&#x27;s collection of Ukrainian/Russian/Soviet art.
At the end of 2003, the Adriaan Willem Weissman building was closed at the insistence of the fire department; renovation work began. The Stedelijk took up temporary residence in the old , where it would remain for 4.5 years. In 2005, the museum established a partnership with The Broere Charitable Foundation; on behalf of the Monique Zajfen Collection, the museum acquired contemporary European artworks, which were placed at the museum on long-term loan. In 2006, debates and lectures were organized in the context of the exhibition &#x27;Mapping the City&#x27;, which explored the relationship of artists to the city. Space was created called the &#x27;Docking Station&#x27; for monthly presentations of work by emerging artists. In 2008, &#x27;Other voices, other rooms&#x27;, an exhibition highlighting the video work of Andy Warhol, drew 600,000 visitors.

In 2006, the city council privatized the Stedelijk. It became a more businesslike enterprise that leases the museum building from the city and, on behalf of the council, mounts exhibitions and manages, maintains, and adds to the municipal collection.

Starting in late 2008, the Stedelijk underwent major construction. In response to this, the museum started the &quot;Stedelijk goes to Town&quot; project to maintain a visual presence within the city of Amsterdam while the building was being renovated. The project ran until the latter half of 2009 and featured a series of workshops, lectures, and presentations in various locations throughout Amsterdam.
From August 2010 until January 2011, the Stedelijk Museum opened its doors with a unique program called &quot;The Temporary Stedelijk&quot; in the restored, yet unfinished historical building. After welcoming &#x27;art, artists and the public&#x27; back through its doors, the Stedelijk continued with this temporary program. &quot;The Temporary Stedelijk 2&quot; opened in March 2011 and focused on the renowned collection of modern and contemporary art and design. The exhibition showcased the breadth of the museum&#x27;s collection and exhibited works by Piet Mondrian, Kazimir Malevich, Charley Toorop, Henri Matisse, Donald Judd, Willem de Kooning, Yves Klein and Bruce Nauman, among others. Selections from the collections were presented on a rotating basis. &quot;The Temporary Stedelijk 3&quot; began in October 2011 and featured exhibitions, presentations, and activities located throughout Amsterdam.

The museum reopened for the general public on 23 September 2012 with the group show &quot;Beyond Imagination&quot;. The artists included in this inaugural show were James Beckett, Eric Bell and Kristoffer Frick, Rossella Biscotti, Eglé Budvytyté, Jeremiah Day, Christian Friedrich, Sara van der Heide, Suchan Kinoshita, Susanne Kriemann, Matthew Lutz-Kinoy, Snejanka Mihaylova, Rory Pilgrim, Falke Pisano, Julika Rudelius, Fiona Tan, Jennifer Tee, Jan van Toorn, Vincent Vulsma and Andros Zins-Browne. In the first month after the reopening, the museum had over 95,000 visitors. In 2017, the Stedelijk Museum hosted events for the 17th edition of the Sonic Acts Festival.

== Vandalism and theft ==
On 21 March 1986, Gerard Jan van Bladeren cut the painting &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue III&quot; (1967) by Barnett Newman with a utility knife during a psychotic episode. He was sentenced to eight months in jail and two years probation, and was banned from the museum for three years. On 21 November 1997, Van Bladeren, the same vandal, cut the painting &quot;Cathedra&quot; (1951), also by Barnett Newman. In court, he pleaded insanity and was not convicted, but was banned from the museum permanently.

On 20 May 1988, the first and only art theft from the Stedelijk took place. The three paintings &quot;Vase with Carnations&quot; (1886) by Vincent van Gogh, &quot;Street in Nevers&quot; (1874) by Johan Jongkind, and &quot;Still life with bottles and apples&quot; by Paul Cézanne were stolen during a break-in. On 31 May 1988, all three paintings were recovered undamaged by police pretending to be buyers. The thief was arrested and convicted.

On 15 May 2011, AFC Ajax&#x27;s victory in the national competition was celebrated at the Museum Square. During the celebration, supporters damaged the Benthem Crouwel Wing&#x27;s rooftop and glass panels, resulting in €400,000 of damage and prompting a change in venue to the Amsterdam Arena for the celebration of AFC Ajax&#x27;s subsequent 2012 victory. Despite these issues, the city government of Amsterdam has stated that it will still consider using the Museum Square as a potential location for large events.

==Collection==
The museum collection holds almost 90,000 objects, collected since 1874. With important clusters and cores focusing on De Stijl, Bauhaus, Pop Art and CoBrA and, more recently, Neo-Impressionism, the collection represents virtually every significant movement in art and design of the 20th and 21st centuries. The Stedelijk also has a comprehensive collection of drawings and paintings by Kazimir Malevich. Key pieces by Post-Impressionists Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh exemplify art from the late 19th century. The collection is sub-divided into the following disciplines:
* Painting
* Sculpture
* Installation
* Moving image and sound
* Prints and drawings
* Posters
* Photography
* Graphic design
* Industrial design
* Artist books
* Lucebert archive

In early 2010, the Stedelijk Museum partnered up with design agency Fabrique and augmented reality firm Layar to develop virtual art tours called &quot;ARtours&quot;. Using smartphone technology, visitors are treated to additional stories and images about the collection both inside the museum and outside around the city. In the final phase of this project at the end of 2011, the public was invited to add their own stories, images, and other information through the open source platform.

In 2018, a mural created by Keith Haring in 1986 on the Stedelijk Museum&#x27;s storage facility was revealed after being covered by sheets of aluminum a few years after its completion. The 40-foot-mural is the artist&#x27;s largest public work and was created for his first solo museum exhibition.

===Digitization===
In November 2009, the museum started a project to digitize the historical archive, which spans from 1895 to 1980. The archive contains around 1.5 million documents in around 7,000 folders, and includes correspondence letters of the director and buyer records. Ownership of the documents has been officially transferred to the Amsterdam City Archive, but the documents will remain in the Stedelijk Museum until the digitization project is completed.

== Weissman Building ==
Dutch architect Adriaan Willem Weissman designed the building for the Stedelijk in 1895. The design of the upper façade and tower in a combination of pale stone and red brick give the exterior of the building a 16th-century Dutch Neo-Renaissance look. In 1938, director Willem Sandberg had the interior walls painted white, creating &#x27;white cube&#x27; gallery spaces. Some years later, in 1954, Sandberg had the opportunity to build a largely glass extension flanking the Van Baerlestraat, which came to be referred to as the &quot;Sandberg Wing&quot;. Sandberg also replaced the museum&#x27;s heavy, rather uninviting doors with a glass entrance. In 1934, Baard turned the loggia above the museum&#x27;s main entrance into an exhibition space and had several galleries repainted in light colors. When Röell took over in 1936, he installed light wall coverings inside some of the galleries and had new doorways put in on the upper-floor galleries. Then, in 1938, Röell had the polychrome staircase whitewashed and replaced the yellow glass in the skylight with lime-washed glass.

Due to poor maintenance and lack of modern facilities, including climate control, the building was deemed unable to meet modern standards. Additionally, it did not have the space to feature the highlights of the collection on permanent display. Since its beginnings, over a century ago, the collection had vastly increased. The art depots and workshops had also become far too cramped. In 1993, a leak in the roof of the museum damaged several large paintings, among them pieces by Ellsworth Kelly and Julian Schnabel. A competition to renovate the museum was first held in the early 1990s, with Robert Venturi beating Rem Koolhaas, Wim Quist, and Carel Weeber to the job. Venturi was replaced by Álvaro Siza Vieira in 1996.

==Relocation and addition==
The old building was forced to close in January 2004 when it no longer complied with fire regulations. The Stedelijk was temporarily relocated to the Post-CS building, an old building of the Postal Service close to the Amsterdam Central Station. When the Post-CS location was closed in 2008, a book called &quot;Stedelijk Museum CS – Prospect/Retrospect&quot; was published to commemorate some of the successful expositions and artists during this period, like Andy Warhol and Rineke Dijkstra.

=== Benthem Crouwel Wing ===

After further discussions about whether to relocate the contemporary art museum to an Amsterdam park, a new jury eventually awarded Benthem Crouwel Architects the renovation and construction contract for their design for the new building, referred to as &quot;The Bathtub&quot;. The new Stedelijk has an exhibition surface area of 8,000 square meters, which is double its previous gallery space. Michael Kimmelman, architecture critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote of the museum&#x27;s addition, &quot;I can&#x27;t recall seeing a more ridiculous looking building than the new Stedelijk Museum.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the extension &quot;oversized, antiseptic and mismatched&quot;.

When Alvaro Siza had originally designed the plans, the reopening was scheduled for 2007. In 2004, when a new competition was held, it became clear that this date was not achievable. Although the renovated original building was completed in early 2010, conditions were not suitable for exhibiting artworks because there was no climate control system, which was to be installed in the new wing. The press poured criticism on the delays. A campaign by Dutch cultural entrepreneur Otto Nan, &quot;Stedelijk Do Something&quot;, urged people to text their disappointment about the delays. This drew considerable media attention and a huge response from social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook. Nan hoped that what he referred to as an &quot;amicable coup&quot; would attract political attention with an occupation of Museum Square. By sending SMS messages, people could raise money to help the museum re-launch a little sooner. With even more delays in 2011 when contractor Midreth went bankrupt, the plan to re-open in the spring of 2010 was moved to 2012. The restored original building went ahead and opened with a temporary exposition in 2010, which attracted about 223,000 visitors.

Contractor VolkerWessels finished the construction in February 2012, after which the climate control system was set up. After eight years of work, the new Stedelijk opened on 23 September 2012. With the renovation and expansion, the highlights of the collection are on display in the old building in a series of changing presentations. The new wing consists of a large glassed entrance, which opens onto the Museum Square, and galleries for temporary exhibitions on the upper level and in the basement. It also houses the museum shop, restaurant and library, as well as an auditorium. The inaugural exhibition, entitled &quot;Beyond Imagination&quot;, was a show of work by emerging Amsterdam artists. A retrospective of the late Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley followed in December 2012.

The completion of the project cost a total of €127M, €20M more than estimated in 2007, which was mostly funded by Amsterdam&#x27;s city council.

==Visual identity==
In 1963, Wim Crouwel and his design company, Total Design, began working for the Stedelijk Museum under the new director Eduard de Wilde. Crouwel designed catalogues, invitations, posters, and brochures using a consistent grid. He wanted to standardize the typography using the Univers typeface since it has the same x height on every weight. This grid-like layout became known as the SM-design style.

Armand Mevis and Linda van Deursen redesigned the logo and visual identity of the museum in 2012, which was gradually unveiled with its re-opening on 23 September 2012. Mevis and van Deursen had previously designed the graphic identity of the temporary Stedelijk program from 2010 to 2012. The main aspect of the new logo is a large sans-serif S that is composed of the letters of the museum&#x27;s name in capital letters. The typeface used is Union, a hybrid of Helvetica and Arial, created by Czech typographer Radim Peško in 2009. Union is used for all of the museum&#x27;s interior and exterior signage and additional materials and resources. The new logo visual identity was controversial at first, especially since Wim Crouwel&#x27;s original logo was extremely admired and influential.

==Organization==
Originally a municipal body, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam became a foundation on 1 January 2006, and is accountable to a supervisory board.

The museum had 138,720 visitors in 2011 and 300,000 visitors in 2012. In the first twelve months after the reopening in September 2012, the museum had 750,000 visitors. In 2013, the museum had 700,000 visitors. It was the 4th most visited museum in the Netherlands, after the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and Anne Frank House, and the 87th most visited art museum worldwide that year. In 2014 and 2015, the museum had respectively 816,396 and .

<text>The Albert Canal (, ; , ) is a canal located in northeastern Belgium, which was named for King Albert I of Belgium. The Albert Canal connects Antwerp with Liège, and also the Meuse river with the Scheldt river. It also connects with the Dessel–Turnhout–Schoten Canal, and its total length is .

==Size and geography==
The Albert Canal has a standard depth of and an overhead clearance of . To allow four-stacked container traffic, bridges over the canal are currently being heightened to allow for a overhead.

Between Antwerp and Liège, there is a difference in elevation of , and six sets of canal locks were needed to overcome this difference. Five canal locks each have a lift of , and these are located in Genk, Diepenbeek, Hasselt, Kwaadmechelen, and Olen, Belgium. The sixth lock at Wijnegem has a lift of .

During most of the 1930s, before the completion of the Albert Canal, it took about seven days to travel from Antwerp to Liège by water. In the 21st century, that same distance can be covered in about 18 hours.

==History==

The Albert Canal was constructed from 1930 through 1939. The German construction company Hochtief AG worked on the canal between 1930 and 1934, but it was completed by Belgian companies. The Albert Canal was used for the first time in 1940 but, because of World War II and the German occupation, intensive use only began later, in 1946.

During World War II, the Albert Canal functioned as a defence line. The crossing of the canal by the German forces and the destruction of Fort Eben-Emael on 11 May 1940 was a milestone in the German invasion of Belgium.

During the Liberation of Belgium by the Allies in September 1944, the Second Canadian Division was the first Allied unit to cross the Albert Canal. The British Army also crossed the Albert Canal on its way north across Belgium and into the Netherlands and the U.S. Army entered Belgium further to the east on its way to liberate the rest of Belgium, and Luxembourg, and then proceed east to invade Nazi Germany. Hence, Belgium was liberated from the south by three different armies, two of which needed to cross the Albert Canal. Though in service for some weeks, the Veldwezelt Bridge near Maastricht, Belgium was reopened ceremoniously on 7 February 1945 by Communications Zone-ETO commanding general Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee and his subordinate, Brig. Gen. Ewart Plank of the forward element of the Com-Z, ADSEC.

==Today==

In 2002, the canal carried a record 43 million tons of goods of various kinds, amounting to more than half the Belgian waterway total.

The canal is also a popular leisure and cycling destination, with well paved service roads on both sides traversing picturesque farm land, particularly around Smeermaas, Lanaken and Maasmechelen.

<text>Miguel Lerdo de Tejada (July 6, 1812 – March 22, 1861) was a Mexican statesman, a leader of the Revolution of Ayutla, and author of the Lerdo Law, extinguishing the right of corporations, including the Roman Catholic Church and indigenous communities, from holding land.

Born in the port of Veracruz, Veracruz, both he and his younger brother, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, became leaders of Mexico&#x27;s Liberal Party. As the president of the (city council) of Mexico City in 1852, Miguel Lerdo de Tejada proposed initiatives on public education, transportation, public health, and budgetary reforms. Lerdo served Antonio López de Santa Anna in his final term as president (1853–55) and then as the Treasury Secretary under liberal president Ignacio Comonfort following the successful implementation of the . In 1856, Miguel Lerdo de Tejada initiated the (Disentailment of Rural and Urban Properties Law), commonly known as the , which called for the forced sale of most properties held by the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico, common lands of indigenous communities, and by municipal and state governments. The Church could retain only the buildings it used for its operations (churches, monasteries, seminary buildings); governments could keep only government offices, jails, and school buildings. Other property, which had been used to generate income for the Church and for local governments, was to be sold with the proceeds going into the national treasury. Because of the disruptions of the War of Reform (1858 - 1861) and the French Intervention (1862 - 1867) that wracked Mexico, few properties were actually sold as a direct result of the &quot;Ley Lerdo&quot;. Most of the &quot;disruptions&quot; attributed to that law actually occurred later, under legislation passed during the regime of Porfirio Díaz (1876 - 1911), but took their legal foundation in the Ley Lerdo.

Miguel Lerdo de Tejada resigned from his position as Treasury Secretary when Comonfort&#x27;s successor, Benito Juárez, rejected Lerdo&#x27;s proposal to suspend the payment of Mexico&#x27;s foreign debt. Lerdo had attempted to negotiate foreign loans using confiscated church property as collateral to fund the liberal side of the War of the Reform, but was unsuccessful. He returned to Mexico City with the victorious Liberal government at the conclusion of the War of the Reform on January 1, 1861, and took up his elected post as a member of the Supreme Court. He campaigned against Juárez in 1861 for the presidency, but he died of typhus on March 22, 1861.

<text>Ainax was a listed holding company that owned shares in the Swedish truck maker Scania. The company was a result of an attempted acquisition of Scania by Volvo that was blocked by the European Commission for competition reasons. 

After Volvo was ordered to discontinue its ownership in Scania, the shares were placed in a separate holding company, which was then divested to the Volvo shareholders, and also traded on the NASDAQ OMX Group marketplace Nya Marknanden, today First North. In March 2006, Scania completed the acquisition of Ainax. Ainax was liquidated and Scania shares were distributed to Ainax&#x27;s owners.

Ainax is a phonetic anagram of Scania (Ainacs).

<text>Abu Musa ( , , ) is an Iranian island in the eastern Persian Gulf, found near the entrance of Strait of Hormuz. Due to the depth of sea, oil tankers and big ships have to pass between Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, making these islands some of the most strategic points in the Persian Gulf. The island is under the administration of Iran, as part of the Hormozgan province.

== Name ==
Iranian inhabitants of Abu Musa call it &quot;Gap-sabzu&quot; (), which in Persian means &quot;the great green place&quot;. On old Persian maps, the island is called:
* &quot;Boum-Ouw&quot; () or &quot;Boum-Ouf&quot; () which in Persian means &quot;Waterland&quot;.
* &quot;Boum-Souz&quot; () or &quot;Boum-Sou&quot;/&quot;Boum-Souw&quot; () or &quot;Gap-Sabzou&quot; () which in Persian means &quot;Green Land&quot;.

In recent centuries it, has also been called &quot;Bum Musa&quot;, Persian for &quot;the land of Musa/Moses&quot;, instead of &quot;Boum-Sou&quot;.

In Arabic sources, &quot;Abu Musa&quot; () comes from Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari, a companion of Muhammad, who stayed on the island in 643 CE before battling the Persians.

== Geography ==
Abu Musa island is located south of Bandar-e Shenas and north-northwest of Sharjah. Out of the 14 islands of Hormozgan, it is the farthest from the Iranian coast. Its highest point is the Mount Halva and has Abu Musa city as the center of the island. The weather in Abu Musa is warm and humid, a better climate compared to other islands in the Persian Gulf. It has the most diverse ecosystem, but lacks suitable soil and water for farming. Fishing is the main industry for the locals. 

It is served by the regional Abu Musa Airport.

== History ==
The sovereignty of Iran on Abu Musa has been disputed by UAE, which inherited a dispute since 1971. By common consent, the island had been under the control of the Al-Qasimi ruler of Sharjah. In 1906 Salim bin Sultan, the uncle of Sharjah&#x27;s ruler Saqr bin Khalid, awarded a concession for iron oxide deposits discovery in the island to three Arabs, whose workers extracted the mineral and agreed to sell it to Wonckhaus, a German enterprise. However, Saqr bin Khalid discovered and disagreed with the act, so he cancelled the grant. The workers were then removed from the island with assistance from the British, resulting in an international incident.

After 1908, the UK controlled the island along with the other British-held islands in the Persian Gulf, including what is today the UAE. In the late 1960s, the UK transferred administration of the island to the British-appointed Sharjah, one of the seven sheikdoms that would later form the UAE.

After the UK announced in 1968 that it would end its administrative and military positions in the Persian Gulf, Iran moved to reattach the island politically to the mainland. On 30 November 1971 (two days before the official establishment of UAE), Iran and Sharjah signed a Memorandum of Understanding. They agreed to allow Sharjah to have a local police station and Iran to station troops on the island according to the map attached to the Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement also divided the island&#x27;s energy resources between the two signatories. &quot;By agreeing to the pact, the tiny emirate prevented an invasion by Iran, which two days earlier had taken two other disputed islands, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which were even smaller and uninhabited.&quot;

===Iranian takeover===
On 30 November 1971, a day before the UK officially left the region, Iran moved troops onto the island and were officially welcomed by the Sheik of Sharjah&#x27;s brother, Sheik Saqer.

===UAE claim===
The UAE took its sovereignty claim over Abu Musa and the two Tunb islands to a meeting of the United Nations Security Council of 9 December 1971. At that meeting, it was decided to &quot;defer consideration of this matter to a later date&quot;. Iraq (Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr era), Kuwait, Algeria, South Yemen and Libya held the view that the territory rightfully belongs to the UAE. Since that time, the UAE has consistently called in public statements for either bilateral negotiations or by referring the issue to the International Court of Justice (or another form of international arbitration).

Saddam Hussein attempted to justify the Iran–Iraq War by claiming that one of the objectives was to &quot;liberate&quot; Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the Persian Gulf. In 1992, Iran expelled &quot;foreign&quot; workers who operated the UAE-sponsored school, medical clinic, and power-generating station. The dispute has also caused serious friction between Ras al-Khaimah and Sharjah on the one hand and some other emirates of the UAE on the other. Ras Al Khaimah advocates tough measures against Iran. Dubai, on the other hand, believes that the conflict is unnecessary. The present ruler of Dubai (who is also Vice President, Prime Minister and Defence Minister of the UAE), Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has earlier stated publicly that &quot;he believes the tensions over the islands have been fabricated by the United States&quot;.

In 2012 a visit to the island by Iranian president Ahmedinejad provoked a diplomatic incident. Iran&#x27;s historical claim to ownership over the islands roots back to the Parthian and Sasanian Empires, among others. Iran considers the island to have been occupied by the UK and refers to the agreement between Iran and the emirate of Sharjah in 1971.

== Demographics ==
, the island had about 2,131 inhabitants, making it Iran&#x27;s smallest county. The city of Abu Musa had 1,953 inhabitants in 2012, up 248 from 2006.

Most of the native residents of the island speak the &quot;Bandari&quot; dialect of Persian.

UAE citizens living on the island allegedly face &quot;great difficulties&quot; with the lack of proper clinics and schools. Only one school exists on the island, and it is used by 150 students. Moreover, patients have to be transported to Sharjah to receive treatment, but that is sometimes not feasible because of the Iranian authorities. In addition, Iran allegedly delays or blocks UAE&#x27;s school and medical supplies from entering the island.

== Climate ==
The island’s climate is hot and arid. Classified as &quot;BWh&quot; under Köppen climate classification. The Island has warm to hot weather throughout the year, with all months averaging above , almost all of the annual precipitation falls during the winter season.

<text>Proto-Indo-European society is the reconstructed culture of Proto-Indo-Europeans, the ancient speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language, ancestor of all modern Indo-European languages.

==Scientific approaches==
Many of the modern ideas in this field involve the unsettled Indo-European homeland debate about the precise origins of the language itself. There are four main approaches researchers have employed in their attempts to study this culture:

*Historical linguistics (especially comparative linguistics): interpretations based on the reconstruction and identification of words and formulae (those cited &quot;*thus&quot; on this page, with a preceding asterisk) which formed part of the vocabulary of the Proto-Indo-European language. These are reconstructed on the basis of sound laws and shared grammatical structures; the definitions hereunder given for the roots should be read as &quot;connotations&quot; (the concepts associated with a word that were inherited in the daughter languages), close to their original &quot;denotation&quot; (the exact meaning at the time of the Proto-Indo-European language).
*Comparative mythology: interpretations based on the comparison of Indo-European beliefs to identify shared themes and characteristics. While few divine names can be confidently reconstructed due to foreign influences and considerable evolutions in beliefs, scholars have been able to recover parts of the Proto-Indo-European mythology. Comparative folklore is often overlooked in Indo-European studies due to the difficulty of dating the origin of folk stories.
*Archaeology: interpretations based on archaeological evidence of a material culture. The Kurgan hypothesis, proposed by archeologists Marija Gimbutas (1956) and David W. Anthony (2007), is the most widely accepted theory on the Indo-European homeland, and postulates an origin in the Pontic-Caspian steppes during the Chalcolithic period. What follows are interpretations based upon this hypothesis.
*Archaeogenetics: interpretations based on the study of ancient DNA to understand the nature of ancient human migrations and &quot;mating networks&quot;. In support for the Kurgan hypothesis, Yamnaya migrations have been linked to the spread of Indo-Europeans languages in several genetic studies published in recent years. In support of the Anatolian Hypothesis, a study named &quot;Mapping the Origins and Expansion of the Indo-European Language Family&quot; gained widespread media attention in 2012, but received scrutiny from historical linguists, who accused the study of abandoning the comparative method and of conflating language with genes. Nonetheless, &quot;Mapping the Origins&quot; has been cited by many since its publication, highlighting an interdisciplinary gap between linguistics and genetics.
==Chronology==
Archaeologist David W. Anthony and linguist Donald Ringe distinguish three different cultural stages in the evolution of the Proto-Indo-European language:

* Early (4500–4000), the common ancestor of all attested Indo-European languages, before the Anatolian split (Cernavodă culture; 4000 BCE); associated with the early Khvalynsk culture,
* Classic, or &quot;post-Anatolian&quot; (4000–3500), the last common ancestor of the non-Anatolian languages, including Tocharian; associated with the late Khvalynsk and Repin cultures,
* Late (3500–2500), in its dialectal period due to the spread of the Yamnaya horizon over a large area.

=== Early Khvalynsk (4900–3900) ===
Domesticated cattle were introduced around 4700 BCE from the Danube valley to the Volga-Ural steppes where the Early Khvalynsk culture (4900–3900) had emerged, associated by Anthony with the Early Proto-Indo-European language. Cattle and sheep were more important in ritual sacrifices than in diet, suggesting that a new set of cults and rituals had spread eastward across the Pontic-Caspian steppes, with domesticated animals at the root of the Proto-Indo-European conception of the universe. Anthony attributes the first and progressive domestication of horses, from taming to actually working with the animal, to this period. Between 4500 and 4200, copper, exotic ornamental shells and polished stone maces were exchanged across the Pontic–Caspian steppes from Varna, in the eastern Balkans, to Khvalynsk, near the Volga river. Around 4500, a minority of richly decorated single graves, partly enriched by imported copper items, began to appear in the steppes, contrasting with the remaining outfitted graves.

The Anatolian distinctive sub-family may have emerged from a first wave of Indo-European migration into southeastern Europe around 4200–4000, coinciding with the Suvorovo–to–Cernavoda I migration, in the context of a progression of the Khvalynsk culture westwards towards the Danube area, from which had also emerged the Novodanilovka (4400–3800) and Late Sredny Stog (4000–3500) cultures.

Recent genetic studies have shown that males of the Khvalynsk culture belonged to the Western Steppe Herder (WSH) cluster, which is a mixture of Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) and Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) ancestry. This admixture appears to have happened on the eastern Pontic–Caspian steppe starting around 5,000 BC.

=== Late Khvalynsk/Repin (3900–3300) ===

Steppe economies underwent a revolutionary change between 4200 and 3300 BCE, in a shift from a partial reliance on herding, when domesticated animals were probably used principally as a ritual currency for public sacrifices, to a later regular dietary dependence on cattle, and either sheep or goat meat and dairy products. The Late Khvalynsk and Repin cultures (3900–3300), associated with the classic (post-Anatolian) Proto-Indo-European language, showed the first traces of cereal cultivation after 4000, in the context of a slow and partial diffusion of farming from the western parts of the steppes to the east. Around 3700–3300, a second migration wave of proto-Tocharian speakers towards South Siberia led to the emergence of the Afanasievo culture (3300–2500).

The spoke-less wheeled wagon was introduced to the Pontic-Caspian steppe around 3500 from the neighbouring North Caucasian Maykop culture (3700–3000), with which Proto-Indo-Europeans traded wool and horses. Interactions with the hierarchical Maykop culture, itself influenced by the Mesopotamian Uruk culture, had notable social effects on the Proto-Indo-European way of life. Meanwhile, the Khvalynsk-influenced cultures that had emerged in the Danube-Donets region after the first migration gave way to the Cernavodă (4000–3200), Usatovo (3500–2500), Mikhaylovka (3600–3000) and Kemi Oba (3700–2200) cultures, from west to east respectively.

=== Yamnaya period (3300–2600) ===

The Yamnaya horizon, associated with the Late Proto-Indo-European language (following both the Anatolian and Tocharian splits), originated in the Don-Volga region before spreading westwards after 3300 BCE, establishing a cultural horizon founded on kurgan funerals that stretched over a vast steppic area between the Dnieper and Volga rivers. It was initially a herding-based society, with limited crop cultivation in the eastern part of the steppes, while the Dnieper-Donets region was more influenced by the agricultural Tripolye culture. Paleolinguistics likewise postulates Proto-Indo-European speakers as a semi-nomadic and pastoral population with subsidiary agriculture. 

Bronze was introduced to the Pontic-Caspian steppes during this period. Following the Yamnaya expansion, long-distance trade in metals and other valuables, such as salt in the hinterlands, probably brought prestige and power to Proto-Indo-European societies. However, the native tradition of pottery making was weakly developed. The Yamnaya funeral sacrifice of wagons, carts, sheep, cattle, and horse was likely related to a cult of ancestors requiring specific rituals and prayers, a connection between language and cult that introduced the Late Proto-Indo-European language to new speakers. Yamnaya chiefdoms had institutionalized differences in prestige and power, and their society was organized along patron-client reciprocity, a mutual exchange of gifts and favors between their patrons, the gods, and human clients. The average life expectancy was fairly high, with many individuals living to 50–60 years old. The language itself appeared as a dialect continuum during this period, meaning that neighbouring dialects differed only slightly between each other, whereas distant language varieties were probably no longer mutually intelligible due to accumulated divergences over space and time.

As the steppe became dryer and colder between 3500 and 3000, herds needed to be moved more frequently in order to feed them sufficiently. Yamnaya distinctive identity was thus founded on mobile pastoralism, permitted by two earlier innovations: the introduction of the wheeled wagon and the domestication of the horse. Yamnaya herders likely watched over their cattle and raided on horseback, while they drove wagons for the bulk transport of water or food. Light-framework dwellings could be easily assembled and disassembled to be transported on pack animals.

Another climate change that occurred after around 3000 led to a more favourable environment allowing for grassland productivity. Yamnaya new pastoral economy then experienced a third wave of rapid demographic expansion, that time towards Central and Northern Europe. Migrations of Usatovo people towards southeastern Poland, crossing through the Old European Tripolye culture from around 3300 BCE, followed by Yamnya migrations towards the Pannonian Basin between 3100 and 2800, are interpreted by some scholars as movements of pre-Italic, pre-Celtic and pre-Germanic speakers.

The Proto-Indo-European language probably ceased to be spoken after 2500 as its various dialects had already evolved into non-mutually intelligible languages that began to spread across most of western Eurasia during the third wave of Indo-European migrations (3300–1500). Indo-Iranian languages were introduced to Central Asia, present-day Iran, and South Asia after 2000 BCE.

== Social structure ==
=== Class structure ===
It is generally agreed that Proto-Indo-European society was hierarchical, with some form of social ranking and various degrees of social status. It is unlikely, however, that they had a rigidly stratified structure, or castes such as are found in historical India. There was a general distinction between free persons and slaves, typically prisoners of war or debtors unable to repay a debt. The free part of society was composed of an elite class of priests, kings and warriors, along with the commoners, with each tribe following a chief (&quot;*&quot;) sponsoring feasts and ceremonies, and immortalized in praise poetry.

The presence of kurgan graves prominently decorated with dress, body ornaments and weaponry, along with well-attested roots for concepts such as &quot;wealth&quot; (&quot;*&quot;), &quot;to be in need&quot; (&quot;*&quot;) or &quot;servant&quot; (&quot;*&quot;, &quot;one who moves about on both sides&quot;; and &quot;*&quot;, &quot;one standing below&quot;), indicate that a hierarchy of wealth and poverty was recognized. Some graves, larger than the average and necessitating a considerable number of people to be built, likewise suggest a higher status given to some individuals. These prestigious funerals were not necessarily reserved to the wealthiest person. Smiths in particular were given sumptuous graves, possibly due to the association of smithery with magic during the early Bronze Age. In general, such graves were mostly occupied by males in the eastern Don-Volga steppes, while they were more egalitarian in the western Dnieper-Donets region.

=== Kinship ===
Linguistics has allowed for the reliable reconstruction of a large number of words relating to kinship relations. These all agree in exhibiting a patriarchal, patrilocal and patrilineal social fabric. Patrilocality is confirmed by lexical evidence, including the word *&quot;-, &#x27;to lead (away)&#x27;, being the word that denotes a male wedding a female. Rights, possessions, and responsibilities were consequently reckoned to the father, and wives were to reside after marriage near the husband&#x27;s family, after the payment of a bride-price.

The household (*&#x27;) was generally ruled by the senior male of the family, the *&#x27; (&#x27;master of the household&#x27;), and could also consist of his children, grandchildren, and perhaps unrelated slaves or servants. His wife probably also played a complementary role: some evidence suggest that she would have kept her position as the mistress (*&quot;) of the household in the event her husband dies, while the eldest son would have become the new master. The Proto-Indo-European expansionist kinship system was likely supported by both marital exogamy (the inclusion of foreign women through marriage) and the exchange of foster children with other families and clans, as suggested by genetic evidence and later attestations from Indo-European-speaking groups.

Once established, the family lasted as long as the male stock of its founder endured, and clan or tribal founders were often portrayed as mythical beings stemming from a legendary past in Indo-European traditions. In this form of kinship organization, the individual&#x27;s genetic distance from the clan&#x27;s founding ancestor determined his social status. But if he was of exceptional prowess or virtue, the same individual could in his turn gain social prestige among the community and eventually found his own descent-group.

In the reconstructed lexicon linking the individual to the clan, *&#x27; means a &#x27;member of one&#x27;s own group&#x27;, &#x27;one who belongs to the community&#x27; (in contrast to an outsider). It gave way to the Indo-Iranian (an endonym), and probably to the Celtic (&#x27;noble, freeman&#x27;), the Hittite (&#x27;peer, companion&#x27;), and the Germanic (&#x27;noble, distinguished&#x27;). It is unlikely however that the term had an ethnic connotation, and we do not know if Proto-Indo-European speakers had a term to designate themselves as a group. Another word, *&#x27;, means &#x27;people&#x27;, &#x27;freemen&#x27; in a more general way.

=== Patron-client ===
Proto-Indo-European had several words for &#x27;leader&#x27;: *&#x27; was a general term derived from *&#x27; (&#x27;set in place, arrange&#x27;); *&quot; meant a ruler who also had religious functions, with the Roman (&#x27;king of the sacred&#x27;) as a heritage of the priestly function of the king.

Public feasts sponsored by such patrons were a way for them to promote and secure a political hierarchy built on the unequal mobilization of labor and resources, by displaying their generosity towards the rest of the community. Rivals competed publicly through the size and complexity of their feasts, and alliances were confirmed by gift-giving and promises made during those public gatherings. The host of the feast was called the *&quot;, the &#x27;lord of the guests&#x27;, who honoured the immortal gods and his mortal guests with gifts of food, drink, and poetry.

=== Guest-host ===
Vertical social inequalities were partly balanced by horizontal mutual obligations of hospitality between guests and hosts. According to Anthony, the domestication of horses and the introduction of the wagon in the Pontic-Caspian steppe between 4500 and 3500 BCE led to an increase in mobility across the Yamnaya horizon, and eventually to the emergence of a guest-host political structure. As various herding clans began to move across the steppes, especially during harsh seasons, it became necessary to regulate local migrations on the territories of tribes which had likely restricted these obligations to their kins or co-residents (*&quot;h₂erós&quot;) until then. In Proto-Indo-European, the term *&quot;ghós-ti&quot;-, whose original meaning must have been &quot;table companion&quot;, could either mean a &quot;host&quot; or a &quot;guest.&quot; The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant cognates, such as Latin &quot;hospēs&quot; (&quot;foreigner, guest; host&quot;), Old English &quot;ġiest&quot; (&quot;stranger, guest&quot;), or Old Church Slavonic &quot;gostĭ&quot; (&quot;guest&quot;) and &quot;gospodĭ&quot; (&quot;master&quot;).

Guests and hosts were indeed involved in a mutual and reciprocal relationship bound by oaths and sacrifices. The giving and receiving of favors was accompanied by a set of ritual actions that indebted the guest to show hospitality to his host at any time in the future. The obligation could even be heritable: Homer’s warriors, Glaukos and Diomedes, stopped fighting and presented gifts to each other when they learned that their &quot;grandfathers&quot; had shared a guest-host relationship. Violations of the guest-host obligations were considered immoral, illegal and unholy: in Irish law, refusing hospitality was deemed a crime as serious as murder. The killing of a guest was also greeted with a singular revulsion, as was the abuse of hospitality.

=== Legal system ===
Because of the archaic nature of traditional legal phraseology—which preserves old forms and meaning for words—and the necessity for legal sentences to be uttered precisely the same way each time to remain binding, it is possible to securely reconstruct some elements of the Proto-Indo-European legal system. For instance, the word *&#x27;- (&#x27;to make a circle, complete&#x27;) designated a type of compensation where the father (or master) had to either pay for the damages caused by his son (or slave), or surrender the perpetrator to the offended party. It is attested by a common legal and linguistic origin in both Roman and Hittite laws. Another root denoting a compensation, *&#x27;, had the meanings of &#x27;blood-price&#x27;, &#x27;vengeance&#x27; or &#x27;guilt&#x27; in daughter languages, suggesting that it was specifically applied to the restitution for theft or violence.

Law was apparently designed to preserve the &#x27;order&#x27; (*&#x27;) of the universe, with the underlying idea that the cosmic harmony should be maintained, be it in the physical universe or the social world. There was however probably no public enforcement of justice, nor were there formal courts as we know them today. Contractual obligations were protected by private individuals acting as sureties: they pledged to be responsible for payments of debts incurred by someone else if the latter defaulted. In case of litigation, one could either take matter into their own hands, for instance by barring someone from accessing their property to compel payment, or bring the case before judges (perhaps kings) that included witnesses. The word for &#x27;oath&#x27;, *&#x27;, derives from the verb *&quot;&quot; (&#x27;to go&#x27;), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.

The root *&#x27; (from *&#x27;, &#x27;to fit&#x27;) is associated with the concept of a cosmic order, that is which is &#x27;fitting, right, ordered&#x27;. It is one of the most securely reconstructed Proto-Indo-European words, with cognates attested in most sub-families: Latin (&#x27;joint&#x27;); Middle High German (&#x27;innate feature, nature, fashion&#x27;); Greek (, &#x27;arrangement&#x27;), possibly (, &#x27;excellence&#x27;); Armenian (, &#x27;ornament, shape&#x27;); Avestan (&#x27;order&#x27;) and (&#x27;truth&#x27;); Sanskrit (, &#x27;right time, order, rule&#x27;); Hittite (, &#x27;right, proper&#x27;); Tocharian A (&#x27;to praise, be pleased with&#x27;).

=== Trifunctional hypothesis ===
The trifunctional hypothesis, proposed by Georges Dumézil, postulates a tripartite ideology reflected in a threefold division between a clerical class (encompassing both the religious and social functions of the priests and rulers), a warrior class (connected with the concepts of courage and combat), and a class of farmers or husbandmen (associated with fertility and craftsmanship), on the basis that many historically known groups speaking Indo-European languages show such a division. Dumézil initially contended that it derived from an actual division in Indo-European societies, but later toned down his approach by representing the system as &quot;fonctions&quot; or general organizing principles. Dumézil&#x27;s theory has been influential and some scholars continue to operate under its framework, although it has also been criticized as aprioristic and too inclusive, and thus impossible to be proved or disproved.

== Culture ==

===Beliefs===

The reconstructed cosmology of the proto-Indo-Europeans shows that the ritual sacrifice of cattle, cows in particular, was at the root of their beliefs, as the primordial condition of the world order. The myth of *&quot;Trito&quot;, the first warrior, involves the liberation of cattle stolen by a three-headed serpent named *&quot;Ngwhi&quot;. After recovering the wealth of the people, Trito eventually offered the cattle to the priest in order to ensure the continuity of the cycle of giving between gods and humans. The creation myth could have rationalized raiding as the recovery of cattle that the gods had intended for the people who sacrificed properly. Many Indo-European cultures preserved the tradition of cattle raiding, which they often associated with epic myths. Georges Dumézil suggested that the religious function was represented by a duality, one reflecting the magico-religious nature of priesthood, while the other is involved in religious sanction to human society (especially contracts), a theory supported by common features in Iranian, Roman, Scandinavian and Celtic traditions. The study of astronomy was not much developed among Proto-Indo-Europeans, and they probably had established names for only a few individual stars and star-groups (e.g. Sirius, Ursa Major).

The basic word for &quot;god&quot; in proto-Indo-European is *&quot;deiwós&quot; (&quot;celestial&quot;), itself a derivative of *&quot;dei&quot;- (&quot;to shine, be bright&quot;). On the other hand, the word for &quot;earth&quot; (*&quot;dʰéǵʰōm)&quot; is at root of both &quot;earthly&quot; and &quot;human&quot;, as it is notably attested in the Latin cognates &quot;humus&quot; and &quot;homo&quot;. This suggests a hierarchical conception of the status of mankind regarding the gods, confirmed by the use of the term &quot;mortal&quot; (&quot;*mr̩tós&quot;) as a synonym of &quot;human&quot; as opposed to the never-dying gods in Indo-European traditions. The idea is expressed in the Homeric phrase &quot;of the immortal gods and of men who walk on earth&quot;.

Proto-Indo-European beliefs were influenced by a resistant animistic substratum, and the few names that can be reconstructed based upon both linguistic (&quot;cognates&quot;) and thematic (&quot;reflexes&quot;) evidence are the cosmic and elemental deities: the &#x27;Daylight-Sky&#x27; (&quot;*Dyḗus&quot;), his partner &#x27;Earth&#x27; (&quot;*Dʰéǵʰōm&quot;), his daughter the &#x27;Dawn&#x27; (*&quot;H₂éwsōs&quot;), and his Twin Sons, the &#x27;Sun&#x27; (&quot;*Séh₂ul&quot;) and the Sun-Maiden, and deities of winds, waters, fire, rivers and springs. The Proto-Indo-European creation myth tells of a primordial sacrifice performed by the first man &quot;*Manu&quot; (&quot;Man&quot;) on his twin brother &quot;*Yemo&quot; (&quot;Twin&quot;), from whom emerged the cosmological elements. Other deities, such as the weather-god &quot;*Perkʷunos&quot; and the guardian of roads and herds, *&quot;Péh₂usōn&quot;, are probably late innovations since they are attested in a restricted number of traditions, Western (European) and Graeco-Aryan, respectively.

=== Rituals ===
Proto-Indo-Europeans practiced a polytheistic religion centered on sacrificial rites of cattle and horses, probably administered by a class of priests or shamans. Animals were slaughtered () and dedicated to the gods () in the hope of winning their favor. The king as the high priest would have been the central figure in establishing good relations with the other world. The Khvalynsk culture, associated with early Proto-Indo-European, had already shown archeological evidence for the sacrifice of domesticated animals. Proto-Indo-Europeans also had a sacred tradition of horse sacrifice for the renewal of kinship involving the ritual mating of a queen or king with a horse, which was then sacrificed and cut up for distribution to the other participants in the ritual.

Although we know little about the role of magic in Proto-Indo-European society, there is no doubt that it existed as a social phenomenon, as several branches attest the use of similarly worded charms and curses, such as ones against worms. Furthermore, incantations and spells were frequently regarded as one of the three categories of medicine, along with the use of surgical instruments and herbs or drugs. Since the earliest evidence for the burning of the plant was found in Romanian kurgans dated 3,500 BCE, some scholars suggest that cannabis was first used as a psychoactive drug by Proto-Indo-Europeans during ritual ceremonies, a custom they eventually spread throughout western Eurasia during their migrations. Descendant cognates of the root &quot;*kanna-&quot; (&quot;cannabis&quot;) have been proposed in Sanskrit &quot;śaná&quot;, Greek &quot;kánnabis&quot; (κάνναβις), Germanic &quot;*hanipa&quot; (German &quot;Hanf&quot;, English &quot;hemp&quot;), Russian &quot;konopljá&quot;, Albanian &quot;kanëp&quot;, Armenian &quot;kanap&quot; and Old Prussian &quot;knapios.&quot; Other linguists suggest that the common linguistic inheritance does not date back to the Indo-European period and contend that the word &quot;cannabis&quot; likely spread later across Eurasia as a &quot;Wanderwort&quot; (&#x27;wandering word&#x27;), ultimately borrowed into Ancient Greek and Sanskrit from a non-Indo-European language.

=== Poetry ===
Poetry and songs were central to Proto-Indo-European society. The poet-singer was the society&#x27;s highest-paid professional, possibly a member of a hereditary profession that ran in certain families, the art passing from father to son as the poet had to acquire all the technical aspects of the art and to master an extensive body of traditional subject matter. He performed against handsome rewards—such as gifts of horses, cattle, wagons and women—and was held in high esteem. In some cases, the poet-singer had a stable relationship with a particular noble prince or family. In other cases, he travelled about with his dependants, attaching himself to one court after another.

A transmitter of inherited cultural knowledge, the poet sang as a &quot;recall&quot; of the old heroic times, entrusted with telling the praises of heroes, kings, and gods. Composing sacred hymns ensured the gods would in turn bestow favourable fate to the community, and for kings that their memory would live on many generations. A lexeme for a special song, the &quot;*erkw&quot; (&quot;praise of the gift&quot;) has been identified in early Proto-Indo-European. Such praise poems proclaimed the generosity of the gods (or a patron) and enumerated their gifts, expanding the patron&#x27;s fame, the path to immortality otherwise only attainable for mortals through conspicuous acts of war or piety.

The concept of &quot;fame&quot; (&quot;*ḱléwos&quot;) was central to Proto-Indo-European poetry and culture. Many poetic dictions built on this term can be reconstituted, including &quot;*ḱléwos wéru&quot; (&quot;wide fame&quot;), &quot;*ḱléwos meǵh₂&quot; (&quot;great fame&quot;), *&quot;ḱléuesh₂ h₂nróm&quot; (&quot;the famous deeds of men, heroes&quot;), or &quot;*dus-ḱlewes&quot; (&quot;having bad repute&quot;). Indo-European poetic tradition was probably oral-formulaic: stock formulas, such as the &quot;imperishable fame&quot; (&quot;*ḱléwos ń̥dʰgʷʰitom&quot;), the &quot;swift horses&quot; (&quot;*h₁ōḱéwes h₁éḱwōs&quot;), the &quot;eternal life&quot; (&quot;*h₂iu-gʷih₃&quot;), the metaphor of the &quot;wheel of the sun&quot; (&quot;*sh₂uens kʷekʷlos&quot;), or the epithet &quot;man-killer&quot; (&quot;*hₐnr̥-gʷhen&quot;), attached to Hektor and Rudra alike, were transmitted among poet-singers to fill out traditional verse-lines in epic song lyrics. The task of the Indo-European poet was to preserve over the generations the famous deeds of heroes. He would compose and retell poems based on old and sometimes obscure formulations, reconnecting the motifs with his own skills and improvisations. Poetry was therefore associated with the acts of &quot;weaving words&quot; (&quot;*wékʷos webh-&quot;) and &quot;crafting speech&quot; (&quot;*wékʷos teḱs-&quot;).

=== Warfare ===

Although Proto-Indo-Europeans have been often cast as warlike conquerors, their reconstructed arsenal is not particularly extensive. There is no doubt that they possessed archery, as several words with the meaning of &quot;spear&quot; (&quot;*gʷéru&quot; ; &quot;*ḱúh₁los&quot;), &quot;pointed stick&quot; (&quot;*h₂eiḱsmo&quot;) or &quot;throwing spear&quot; (&quot;*ǵʰai-só-s&quot;) are attested. The term &quot;*wēben&quot; meant a &quot;cutting weapon&quot;, probably a knife, and &quot;*h₂/₃n̩sis&quot; a &quot;large offensive knife&quot;, likely similar to bronze daggers found across Eurasia around 3300–3000 BCE. Proto-Indo-Europeans certainly did not know swords, which appeared later around 2000–1500. The axe was known as &quot;*h₄edʰés&quot;, while the word &quot;*spelo/eh₂&quot; designated a wooden or leather shield. The term &quot;*leh₂wós&quot; meant &quot;military unit&quot; or &quot;military action&quot;, while &quot;*teutéh₂-&quot; might have referred to the &quot;adult male with possession&quot; who would mobilize during warfare, perhaps originally a Proto-Indo-European term meaning &quot;the people under arms&quot;.

A number of scholars propose that Proto-Indo-European rituals included the requirement that young unmarried men initiate into manhood by joining a warrior-band named *&quot;kóryos&quot;. They were led by a senior male and lived off the country by hunting and engaging in raiding and pillaging foreign communities. Kóryos members served in such brotherhoods (&quot;Männerbünde&quot;) for a number of years before returning home to adopt more respectable identities as mature men. During their initiation period, the young males wore the skin and bore the names of wild animals, especially wolves (*&quot;wl̩kʷo&quot;) and dogs (&quot;*ḱwōn&quot;), in order to assume their nature and escape the rules and taboos of their host society.

Most kurgan stelae found in Pontic-Caspian steppe feature a man wearing a belt and weapons carved on the stone. In later Indo-European traditions, notably the (half-)naked warrior figures of Germanic and Celtic art, &quot;*kóryos&quot; raiders wore a belt that bound them to their leader and the gods, and little else. The tradition of kurgan stelae featuring warriors with a belt is also common in Scythian cultures. A continuity of an &quot;animal-shaped raid culture&quot; has been also postulated based on various elements attested in later Indo-European-speaking cultures, such as the Germanic Berserkers, the Italic &quot;Ver Sacrum&quot;, and the Spartan Crypteia, as well as in the mythical Celtic fianna and Vedic Maruts, and in the legend of the werewolf (&quot;man-wolf&quot;), found in Greek, Germanic, Baltic and Slavic traditions alike.

In a mostly patriarchal economy based on bride competition, the escalation of the bride-price in periods of climate change could have resulted in an increase in cattle raiding by unmarried men. Scholars also suggest that, alongside the attractiveness of the patron-client and the guest-host relationships, the *&quot;kóryos&quot; could have played a key role in diffusing Indo-European languages across most of Eurasia.

=== Personal names ===
The use of two-word compound words for personal names, typically but not always ascribing some noble or heroic feat to their bearer, is so common in Indo-European languages that it is certainly an inherited feature. These names often belonged in early dialects to the class of compound words that in the Sanskrit tradition are called &quot;bahuvrihi&quot;. As in Vedic &quot;bahuvrihi&quot; (literally &quot;much-rice&quot;, meaning &quot;one who has much rice&quot;), those compounds are formed as active structures indicating possession and do not require a verbal root. From the Proto-Indo-European personal name &quot;*Ḱléwos-wésu&quot; (lit. &quot;good-fame&quot;, meaning &quot;possessing good fame&quot;) derive the Liburnian &quot;Vescleves&quot;, the Greek &quot;Eukleḗs&quot; (Εὐκλεής), the Old Persian &quot;Huçavah&quot;, the Avestan &quot;Haosravah-&quot;, and the Sanskrit &quot;Suśráva&quot;.

A second type of compound consists of a noun followed by a verbal root or stem, describing an individual performing an action. Compounds more similar to synthetics are found in the Sanskrit &quot;Trasá-dasyus&quot; (&quot;one who causes enemies to tremble&quot;), the Greek &quot;Archelaus&quot; (Ἀρχέλαος, &quot;one who rules people&quot;), and the Old Persian &quot;Xšayāršan&quot; (&quot;one who rules men&quot;).

Many Indo-European personal names are associated with the horse (*&quot;&quot;) in particular, which expressed both the wealth and nobility of their bearer, including the Avestan &quot;Hwaspa&quot; (&quot;owning good horses&quot;), the Greek &quot;Hippónikos&quot; (&quot;winning by his horses&quot;), or the Gaulish &quot;Epomeduos&quot; (&quot;master of horses&quot;). Since domestic animals also served to sacrifice, there were often used as exocentric structures in compound names (the bearers are not &#x27;horses&#x27; themselves but &#x27;users of horses&#x27; in some way), in contrast to endocentric personal names rather associated with wild animals like the wolf, for instance in the German &quot;Rudolf&quot; (&quot;a famous wolf&quot;) or the Serbian &quot;Dobrovuk&quot; (&quot;a good wolf&quot;).

== Economy ==
Proto-Indo-Europeans possessed a Neolithic mixed economy based on livestock and subsidiary agriculture, with a wide range of economic regimes and various degrees of mobility that could be expected across the large Pontic-Caspian steppe. Tribes were typically more influenced by farming in the western Dnieper-Donets region, where cereal cultivation was practised, while the eastern Don-Volga steppes were inhabited by semi-nomadic and pastoral populations mostly relying on herding.

Proto-Indo-European distinguished between unmovable and movable wealth (&quot;*péḱu&quot;, the &quot;livestock&quot;). As for the rest of society, economy was founded on reciprocity. A gift always entailed a counter-gift, and each party was bound to the other in a mutual relationship cemented by trust.

=== Trade ===
The early Khvalynsk culture, located in the Volga-Ural steppes and associated with early Proto-Indo-European, had trade relationship with Old European cultures. Domesticated cattle, sheep and goats, as well as copper, were introduced eastward from the Danube valley around 4700–4500. Copper objects show an artistic influence from Old Europe, and the appearance of sacrificed animals suggest that a new set of rituals emerged following the introduction of herding from the west. The Old European Tripolye culture continued to influence the western part of the steppes, in the Dnieper-Donets region, where the Yamnaya culture was more agricultural and less male-centered.

Proto-Indo-European speakers also had indirect contacts with Uruk around 3700–3500 through the North Caucasian Maikop culture, a trade route that introduced the wheeled wagon into the Caspian-Pontic steppes. Wheel-made pottery imported from Mesopotamia were found in the Northern Caucasus, and Maikop chieftain was buried wearing Mesopotamian symbols of power—the lion paired with the bull. The late Khvalynsk and Repin cultures probably traded wool and domesticated horses in exchange, as suggested by the widespread appearance of horses in archeological sites across Transcaucasia after 3300. Socio-cultural interactions with Northwest Caucasians have been proposed, on the ground that the Proto-Indo-European language shows a number of lexical parallels with Proto-Northwest Caucasian. Proto-Indo-European also exhibits lexical loans to or from other Caucasian languages, particularly Proto-Kartvelian.

Proto-Indo-European probably also had trade relationships with Proto-Uralic speakers around the Ural Mountains. Words for &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;wash&quot; were borrowed in Proto-Uralic, and words for &quot;price&quot; and &quot;draw, lead&quot; were introduced in the Proto-Finno-Ugric language. James P. Mallory suggested that the expansion of the Uralic languages across the northern forest zone might have been stimulated by organizational changes within Uralic forager societies, resulting partly from interaction with more complex, hierarchical Proto-Indo-European and (later) Indo-Iranian pastoral societies at the steppe/forest-steppe ecological border.

===Technology===

From the reconstructable lexicon, it is clear that Proto-Indo-Europeans were familiar with wheeled vehicles—certainly horse-drawn wagons (&quot;*weǵʰnos&quot;)—as they knew the wheel (&quot;*kʷekʷlóm&quot;), the axle (&quot;*h₂eḱs-&quot;), the shaft (&quot;*h₂/₃éih₁os&quot;), and the yoke (&quot;*yugóm&quot;). Although wheels were most likely not invented by Proto-Indo-Europeans, the word &quot;*kʷekʷlóm&quot; is a native derivation of the root (&quot;to turn&quot;) rather than a borrowing, suggesting short contacts with the people who introduced the concept to them.

The technology used was a solid wheel made of three planks joined with their outer edges trimmed to a circle. The swift chariot with spoked wheels, which made the mode of transport much more rapid and lighter, appeared later within the Sintashta culture (2100–1800), associated with the Indo-Iranians. As the word for &quot;boat&quot; (&quot;*néh₂us&quot;) is widely attested across the language groups, the means of transport (likely a dugout canoe) was certainly known by Proto-Indo-Europeans.

The vocabulary associated with metallurgy is very restricted and at best we can attest the existence of copper/bronze, gold, and silver. The basic word for &quot;metal&quot; (&quot;*h₂ey-es&quot;) is generally presumed to mean &quot;copper&quot; or a copper-tin alloy of &quot;bronze&quot;. &quot;Gold&quot; is reliably reconstructed as &quot;*h₂eusom&quot;, and &quot;*h₂erǵ-n̩t-om&quot; designated a &quot;white metal&quot; or &quot;silver&quot;. Proto-Indo-Europeans were also familiar with the sickle (&quot;*sr̩po/eh₂&quot;), the awl (&quot;*h₁óleh₂&quot;) for working leather or drilling wood, and used a primitive plough (&quot;*h₂érh₃ye/o&quot;) made of a curved and forked branch.

The term for &quot;oven&quot; or &quot;cooking vessel&quot; (&quot;*h₂/₃ukʷ&quot;) has been reconstructed based on four branches, as for &quot;baking&quot; (&quot;*bʰōg-&quot;) and &quot;boiling&quot; (&quot;*yes-&quot;). They certainly drank beer (&quot;*h₂elut&quot;) and mead (&quot;*médʰu&quot;), and the word for &quot;wine&quot; (*&quot;wóinom&quot;) has been proposed, although this remains a debated issue. Proto-Indo-Europeans produced textile, as attested by the reconstructed roots for wool (&quot;*wĺh₂neh₂&quot;), flax (&quot;*linom&quot;), sewing (&quot;*syuh₁-&quot;), spinning (&quot;*(s)pen-&quot;), weaving (&quot;*h₂/₃webʰ-&quot;) and plaiting (&quot;*pleḱ-&quot;), as well as needle (&quot;*skʷēis&quot;) and thread (&quot;*pe/oth₂mo&quot;). They were also familiar with combs (&quot;*kes&quot;) and ointments with salve (&quot;*h₃engʷ-&quot;).

== Animals ==
Animals (mammals in particular) are fairly abundant in the reconstructed lexicon. We can ascribe about seventy-five names to various animal species, but it hardly recovers all the animals to have been distinguished in the proto-language.&#x27; While &quot;*kʷetwor-pod&quot; designated a four-footed animal (tetrapod), &quot;*gʷyéh₃wyom&quot; seems to have been the general term for animals, derived from the root &quot;*gʷyeh₃&quot;-, &quot;to live&quot;. Proto-Indo-European speakers also made a distinction between wild animals (&quot;*&quot;) and the livestock (&quot;*&quot;).&#x27;

===Domesticated animals===
The reconstructed lexicon suggests a Neolithic economy with extensive references to domesticated animals.&quot;&quot; They were familiar with cows (*&quot;&quot;), sheep (*&quot;&quot;), goats (&quot;*díks&quot;, or *&quot;h₂eiĝs&quot;) and pigs (&quot;*&quot; ; also &quot;*&quot;, &quot;piglet&quot;).

They knew dogs (&quot;*&quot;), milk (&quot;*ǵl̩ákt&quot;; also &quot;&quot;, &quot;to milk&quot;) and dairy foods, wool (&quot;*&quot;) and woollen textiles, agriculture, wagons, and honey (&quot;*&quot;). The domestication of the horse (*&quot;&quot;), thought to be an extinct Tarpan species, probably originated with these peoples, and scholars invoke this innovation as a factor contributing to their increased mobility and rapid expansion.

The dog was perceived as a symbol of death and depicted as the guardian of the Otherworld in Indo-European cultures (Greek Cerberus, Indic Śārvara, Norse Garmr). The mytheme possibly stems from an older Ancient North Eurasian belief, as evidenced by similar motifs in Native American and Siberian mythology, in which case it might be one of the oldest mythemes recoverable through comparative mythology. In various Indo-European traditions, the worst throw at the game of dice was named the &quot;dog&quot;, and the best throw was known as the &quot;dog-killer&quot;. Canine teeth of dogs were frequently worn as pendants in Yamnaya graves in the western Pontic steppes, particularly in the Ingul valley.

=== Wild animals ===
Linguistic evidence suggest that Proto-Indo-European speakers were also in contact with various wild animals, such as red foxes (*&quot;wl(o)p&quot;), wolves (*&quot;&quot;), bears (*&quot;&quot;), red deers (*&quot;h₁elh₁ēn&quot;), elks (moose) (*&quot;h₁ólḱis&quot;), eagles (*&quot;),&quot; otters (*&quot;&quot;), snakes (*&quot;&quot;), mice (&quot;*mūs&quot; ; from &quot;*mus-&quot;, &quot;to steal&quot;), or trouts (&quot;*lóḱs&quot;).

Some of them were featured in mythological and folkloric motifs. Goats draw the chariots of the Norse and Indic gods Thor and Pushan, and they are associated with the Baltic god Perkūnas and the Greek god Pan. The words for both the wolf and the bear underwent taboo deformation in a number of branches, suggesting that they were feared as symbols of death in Proto-Indo-European culture.

In Indo-European culture, the term &quot;wolf&quot; is generally applied to brigands and outlaws who live in the wild. Ritual and mythological concepts connected with wolves, in some cases similar with Native American beliefs, may represent a common Ancient North Eurasian heritage: &quot;mai-coh&quot; meant both &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;witch&quot; among Navajos, and &quot;shunk manita tanka&quot; a &quot;doglike powerful spirit&quot; among Očhéthi Šakówiŋ, while the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ṷeid&quot; (&quot;knowledge, clairvoyance&quot;) designated the wolf in both Hittite (&quot;ṷetna&quot;) and Old Norse (&quot;witnir&quot;), and a &quot;werewolf&quot; in Slavic languages (Serbian &quot;vjedogonja&quot; and &quot;vukodlak&quot;, Slovenian &quot;vedanec&quot;, Ukrainian &quot;viščun&quot;).

<text>Personal Services is a 1987 British comedy film directed by Terry Jones and written by David Leland, about the rise of a madam of a suburban brothel which caters to older men. The story is inspired by the real experiences of Cynthia Payne, the &quot;House of Cyn&quot; madam.

==Plot==
Christine Painter is a sexually naïve waitress and single mother who pays for her teenage son David&#x27;s tuition by renting London flats to call girls. When a landlord confronts her for illegally subletting the flats and falling behind on the rent, Christine gives him a handjob in lieu of rent. After one of her &quot;tenants&quot;, Rose, refuses to pay rent, Christine realises she can do sex work herself in the flat Rose abandons.

Christine is charged with soliciting and pleads guilty in court. Soon she hatches a scheme with fellow sex worker Shirley to provide strictly kinky services such as bondage and fetish roleplay to an upscale clientele.
They rent a suburban house, where they are joined by their &quot;maid&quot; Dolly.

Christine attends her sister&#x27;s wedding, where Dolly is accidentally exposed as transvestite to the groom&#x27;s mother. Christine&#x27;s father and sister angrily denounce her for spoiling the wedding.

Christine&#x27;s father later visits the brothel for sex and reconciles with his daughter. The brothel enjoys brisk business, but soon attracts the notice of the police, who raid the house on Christmas Eve.

When Christine appears in court to be arraigned, she is relieved when she realises the judge is one of her main clients; she then imagines the courtroom filled with all of her clients as judges.

<text>The Great Thunderstorm of Widecombe-in-the-Moor in Dartmoor, Kingdom of England, took place on Sunday, 21 October 1638, when the church of St Pancras was apparently struck by ball lightning during a severe thunderstorm. An afternoon service was taking place at the time, and the building was packed with approximately 300 worshippers. Four of them were killed, around 60 injured, and the building severely damaged.

==Eyewitness accounts==
Written accounts by eyewitnesses, apparently published within months of the catastrophe, tell of a strange darkness, powerful thunder, and &quot;a great ball of fire&quot; ripping through a window and tearing part of the roof open. It is said to have rebounded through the church, killing some members of the congregation and burning many others. This is considered by some to be one of the earliest recorded instances of ball lightning.

The Anglican minister, George Lyde, was unhurt, but his wife &quot;had her ruff and the linen next her body, and her body, burnt in a very pitiful manner&quot;. The head of local warrener Robert Mead struck a pillar so hard that it left an indentation; his skull was shattered, and his brain hurled to the ground. A &quot;one Master Hill a Gentleman of good account in the Parish&quot; was thrown violently against a wall and died &quot;that night&quot;. His son, sitting next to him, was unhurt.

Some are said to have suffered burns to their bodies, but not their clothes. A dog is reported to have run out of the door, been hurled around as if by a small tornado, and fallen dead to the ground.

The village schoolmaster of the time, a gentleman called Roger Hill, and brother of the deceased &quot;Master Hill&quot;, recorded the incident in a rhyming testament which is still displayed on boards (originals replaced in 1786) in the church.

==The legend==
According to local legend, the thunderstorm was the result of a visit by the devil who had made a pact with a local card player and gambler called Jan Reynolds (or Bobby Read, according to the tale recorded at the Tavistock Inn, Poundsgate). The deal was that if the devil ever found him asleep in church, he could have his soul. Jan was said to have fallen asleep during the service that day, with his pack of cards in his hand. Another version of the legend states that the Devil arrived to collect the souls of four people playing cards during the church service.

The devil supposedly headed for Widecombe via the Tavistock Inn, in nearby Poundsgate, where he stopped for directions and refreshment. The landlady reported a visit by a man in black with cloven feet riding a jet black horse. The stranger ordered a mug of ale, and it hissed as it went down his throat. He finished his drink, put the mug down on the bar where it left a scorch mark, and left some money. After the stranger had ridden away, the landlady found that the coins had turned to dried leaves.

The devil tethered his horse to one of the pinnacles at Widecombe Church, captured the sleeping Jan Reynolds, and rode away into the storm. As they flew over nearby Birch Tor, the four aces from Jan&#x27;s pack of cards fell to the ground, and today, if you stand at Warren House Inn, you can still see four ancient field enclosures, each shaped like the symbols from a pack of cards.

<text>In geometry, a pentahedron (: pentahedra) is a polyhedron with five faces or sides. There are no face-transitive polyhedra with five sides and there are two distinct topological types.

With regular polygon faces, the two topological forms are the square pyramid and triangular prism.

The &quot;square pyramid&quot; can be seen as a &quot;triangular prism&quot; where one of its side edges (joining two squares) is collapsed into a point, losing one edge and one vertex, and changing two squares into triangles.

Geometric variations with irregular faces can also be constructed.

Some irregular pentahedra with six vertices may be called wedges.

An irregular pentahedron can be a non-convex solid: Consider a non-convex (planar) quadrilateral (such as a dart) as the base of the solid, and any point not in the base plane as the apex.

==Hosohedron==
There is a third topological polyhedral figure with 5 faces, degenerate as a polyhedron: it exists as a spherical tiling of digon faces, called a pentagonal hosohedron with Schläfli symbol {2,5}. It has 2 (antipodal point) vertices, 5 edges, and 5 digonal faces.

<doc id="931880" wikidata="Q5254541" url="?curid=931880" title="Delta-v budget">
<text>In astrodynamics and aerospace, a delta-v budget is an estimate of the total change in velocity (delta-&quot;v&quot;) required for a space mission. It is calculated as the sum of the delta-v required to perform each propulsive maneuver needed during the mission. As input to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, it determines how much propellant is required for a vehicle of given empty mass and propulsion system.

Delta-&quot;v&quot; is a scalar quantity dependent only on the desired trajectory and not on the mass of the space vehicle. For example, although more fuel is needed to transfer a heavier communication satellite from low Earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit than for a lighter one, the delta-&quot;v&quot; required is the same. Delta-&quot;v&quot; is also additive, as contrasted to rocket burn time, the latter having greater effect later in the mission when more fuel has been used up.

Tables of the delta-&quot;v&quot; required to move between different space regime are useful in the conceptual planning of space missions. In the absence of an atmosphere, the delta-&quot;v&quot; is typically the same for changes in orbit in either direction; in particular, gaining and losing speed cost an equal effort. An atmosphere can be used to slow a spacecraft by aerobraking.

A typical delta-&quot;v&quot; budget might enumerate various classes of maneuvers, delta-&quot;v&quot; per maneuver, and number of each maneuver required over the life of the mission, then simply sum the total delta-&quot;v&quot;, much like a typical financial budget. Because the delta-v needed to achieve the mission usually varies with the relative position of the gravitating bodies, launch windows are often calculated from porkchop plots that show delta-&quot;v&quot; plotted against the launch time.

==General principles==
The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows that the delta-v of a rocket (stage) is proportional to the logarithm of the fuelled-to-empty mass ratio of the vehicle, and to the specific impulse of the rocket engine. A key goal in designing space-mission trajectories is to minimize the required delta-v to reduce the size and expense of the rocket that would be needed to successfully deliver any particular payload to its destination.

The simplest delta-v budget can be calculated with Hohmann transfer, which moves from one circular orbit to another coplanar circular orbit via an elliptical transfer orbit. In some cases a bi-elliptic transfer can give a lower delta-v.
A more complex transfer occurs when the orbits are not coplanar. In that case there is an additional delta-v necessary to change the plane of the orbit. The velocity of the vehicle needs substantial burns at the intersection of the two orbital planes and the delta-v is usually extremely high. However, these plane changes can be almost free in some cases if the gravity and mass of a planetary body are used to perform the deflection. In other cases, boosting up to a relatively high altitude apoapsis gives low speed before performing the plane change, thus requiring lower total delta-v.

The slingshot effect can be used to give a boost of speed/energy; if a vehicle goes past a planetary or lunar body, it is possible to pick up (or lose) some of that body&#x27;s orbital velocity relative to the Sun or another planet.

Another effect is the Oberth effect—this can be used to greatly decrease the amount of fuel needed to achieve a given delta-v, because using propellant at low potential energy/high speed multiplies the effect of a burn. Thus for example the delta-v for a Hohmann transfer from Earth&#x27;s orbital radius to Mars&#x27;s orbital radius (to overcome the Sun&#x27;s gravity) is many kilometres per second, but the incremental burn from low Earth orbit (LEO) over and above the burn to overcome Earth&#x27;s gravity is far less if the burn is done close to Earth than if the burn to reach a Mars transfer orbit is performed at Earth&#x27;s orbit, but far away from Earth.

A less used effect is low energy transfers. These are highly nonlinear effects that work by orbital resonances and by choosing trajectories close to Lagrange points. They can be very slow, but use very little delta-v.

Because delta-v depends on the position and motion of celestial bodies, particularly when using the slingshot effect and Oberth effect, the delta-v budget changes with launch time. These can be plotted on a porkchop plot.

Course corrections usually also require some propellant budget. Propulsion systems never provide precisely the right propulsion in precisely the right direction at all times, and navigation also introduces some uncertainty. Some propellant needs to be reserved to correct variations from the optimum trajectory.

== Budget ==

=== Launch/landing ===

The delta-v requirements for sub-orbital spaceflight are much lower than for orbital spaceflight. For the Ansari X Prize altitude of 100 km, Space Ship One required a delta-v of roughly 1.4 km/s. To reach the initial low Earth orbit of the International Space Station of 300 km (now 400 km), the delta-v is over six times higher, about 9.4 km/s. Because of the exponential nature of the rocket equation the orbital rocket needs to be considerably bigger.

*Launch to LEO—this not only requires an increase of velocity from 0 to 7.8 km/s, but also typically 1.5–2 km/s for atmospheric drag and gravity drag
*Re-entry from LEO—the delta-v required is the orbital maneuvering burn to lower perigee into the atmosphere, atmospheric drag takes care of the rest.

=== Earth–Moon space—high thrust ===

Delta-v needed to move inside the Earth–Moon system (speeds lower than escape velocity) are given in km/s. This table assumes that the Oberth effect is being used—this is possible with high thrust chemical propulsion but not with current (as of 2018) electrical propulsion.


=== Earth–Moon space—low thrust ===

Current electric ion thrusters produce a very low thrust (milli-newtons, yielding a small fraction of a &quot;g),&quot; so the Oberth effect cannot normally be used. This results in the journey requiring a higher delta-&quot;v&quot; and frequently a large increase in time compared to a high thrust chemical rocket. Nonetheless, the high specific impulse of electrical thrusters may significantly reduce the cost of the flight. For missions in the Earth–Moon system, an increase in journey time from days to months could be unacceptable for human space flight, but differences in flight time for interplanetary flights are less significant and could be favorable.

The table below presents delta-&quot;v&quot;&#x27;s in km/s, normally accurate to 2 significant figures and will be the same in both directions, unless aerobraking is used as described in the high thrust section above.

=== Earth Lunar Gateway—high thrust ===

The Lunar Gateway space station is planned to be deployed in a highly elliptical seven-day near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the Moon. Spacecraft launched from Earth would perform a powered flyby of the Moon followed by a NRHO orbit insertion burn to dock with the Gateway as it approaches the apoapsis point of its orbit.


=== Interplanetary ===

The spacecraft is assumed to be using chemical propulsion and the Oberth effect.

According to Marsden and Ross, &quot;The energy levels of the Sun–Earth and points differ from those of the Earth–Moon system by only 50 m/s (as measured by maneuver velocity).&quot;

We may apply the formula
:formula_1
(where μ = GM is the standard gravitational parameter of the sun, see Hohmann transfer orbit) to calculate the Δ&quot;v&quot; in km/s needed to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets, and using perihelion distance for Pluto). In this table, the column labeled &quot;Δ&quot;v&quot; to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth&#x27;s orbit&quot; gives the change from Earth&#x27;s velocity to the velocity needed to get on a Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the Sun. The column labeled &quot;v exiting LEO&quot; gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centred on Earth) when 300 km above Earth&#x27;s surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73 km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth&#x27;s gravity well at this LEO). The column &quot;Δ&quot;v&quot; from LEO&quot; is simply the previous speed minus 7.73 km/s. The transit time is calculated as formula_2 years.

Note that the values in the table only give the Δv needed to get to the orbital distance of the planet. The speed relative to the planet will still be considerable, and in order to go into orbit around the planet either aerocapture is needed using the planet&#x27;s atmosphere, or more Δv is needed.

The &quot;New Horizons&quot; space probe to Pluto achieved a near-Earth speed of over 16 km/s which was enough to escape from the Sun. (It also got a boost from a fly-by of Jupiter.)

To get to the Sun, it is actually not necessary to use a Δ&quot;v&quot; of 24 km/s. One can use 8.8 km/s to go very far away from the Sun, then use a negligible Δ&quot;v&quot; to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the Sun. This sequence of two Hohmann transfers, one up and one down, is a special case of a bi-elliptic transfer. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the Moon for a gravity assist. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the Sun. The &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft used Venus once and Earth twice in order to reach Jupiter. The &quot;Ulysses&quot; solar probe used Jupiter to attain polar orbit around the Sun.

=== Delta-vs between Earth, Moon and Mars ===
Delta-v needed for various orbital manoeuvers using conventional rockets.

;Abbreviations key:
* Escape orbits with low pericentre – C3 = 0
* Geostationary orbit – GEO 
* Geostationary transfer orbit – GTO 
* Earth–Moon Lagrangian point – L5 
* Low Earth orbit – LEO
* &quot;Lunar orbit&quot; means low lunar orbit
* Red arrows show where optional aerobraking/aerocapture can be performed in that particular direction, black numbers give delta-v in km/s that apply in either direction. Lower-delta-v transfers than shown can often be achieved, but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer, see: fuzzy orbital transfers.
* Electric propulsion vehicles going from Mars C3 = 0 to Earth C3 = 0 without using the Oberth effect need a larger Delta-v of between 2.6 km/s and 3.15 km/s. Not all possible links are shown.
* The Delta-v for C3 = 0 to Mars transfer must be applied at pericentre, i.e. immediately after accelerating to the escape trajectory, and do not agree with the formula above which gives 0.4 from Earth escape and 0.65 from Mars escape.
* The figures for LEO to GTO, GTO to GEO, and LEO to GEO are inconsistent. The figure of 30 for LEO to the Sun is also too high.

=== Near-Earth objects ===

Near-Earth objects are asteroids whose orbits can bring them within about 0.3 astronomical units of the Earth. There are thousands of such objects that are easier to reach than the Moon or Mars. Their one-way delta-v budgets from LEO range upwards from , which is less than 2/3 of the delta-v needed to reach the Moon&#x27;s surface. But NEOs with low delta-v budgets have long synodic periods, and the intervals between times of closest approach to the Earth (and thus most efficient missions) can be decades long.

The delta-v required to return from Near-Earth objects is usually quite small, sometimes as low as , with aerocapture using Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. However, heat shields are required for this, which add mass and constrain spacecraft geometry. The orbital phasing can be problematic; once rendezvous has been achieved, low delta-v return windows can be fairly far apart (more than a year, often many years), depending on the body.

In general, bodies that are much further away or closer to the Sun than Earth, have more frequent windows for travel, but usually require larger delta-vs.

<text>All Star United is a Christian rock band that was formed by solo artist Ian Eskelin in 1996. The band is known for clever and sometimes sarcastic lyrics, as they frequently use their songs as vehicles to lampoon perceived excesses in Western culture. Their musical style combines elements of alternative rock and Britpop, anchored by melodically powerful choruses.

All Star United has released five studio albums, one EP, one compilation album that includes two previously unreleased songs, and three music videos. Their latest studio album, &quot;The Good Album&quot;, was released in January 2010 and includes an additional radio single &quot;Beautiful Way.&quot; The band has had several No. 1 charting songs in the United States, including the songs &quot;Smash Hit&quot; and &quot;Superstar&quot;. They also had a No. 1 single in Singapore titled &quot;If We Were Lovers&quot;. Band leader and founder Eskelin has also released three solo projects and currently writes and produces for a variety of bands and artists. In 2008, Eskelin received a Dove Award for &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; and was nominated again in the same category in 2009.

All Star United&#x27;s songs have been licensed in recent years for use on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Evidence&quot;, the movie &quot;Saved!&quot;, the trailer for the film &quot;Superbad&quot;, and multiple CBS network imaging campaigns.

==Band history==
All Star United was formed in 1996 by frontman Ian Eskelin, drummer Christian Crowe, guitarist Brian Whitman, keyboardist Patrick McCallum, and bassist Gary Miller. Shortly after, Miller was replaced by Adrian Walther, and guitarist Dave Clo was added to the line-up. They released their eponymous debut album in 1997 to much critical acclaim. They followed it with &quot;International Anthems for the Human Race&quot; in 1998, which received equal praise. The band toured heavily in the United States and internationally during this period.

Amidst some line-up changes and label changes, the band released a compilation album titled &quot;Smash Hits&quot; in 2000. In 2002, the band signed with Delirious? record label, Furious Records, and released their third studio album titled &quot;Revolution&quot;.

After this, the band retired from heavy touring while Eskelin recorded and released a solo project and produced albums for several other artists. However, in 2007, the original line-up (minus Patrick) reunited and released &quot;Love and Radiation&quot;.

All Star United&#x27;s most recent project, &quot;The Good Album&quot;, was released in January 2010.

<text>Francis Kelly (28 December 1938 – 28 February 2016) was an Irish actor, singer and writer, whose career covered television, radio, theatre, music, screenwriting and film. He is best remembered for playing Father Jack Hackett in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Kelly was born, in 1938, in Blackrock, County Dublin, which remained his home for much of his life. His father was Charles E. Kelly, a cartoonist who established the magazine &quot;Dublin Opinion&quot;. He was educated at Blackrock College and studied law at University College Dublin, before taking up journalism, working for some years as a subeditor at a number of Irish newspapers, prior to becoming an actor. He worked at Dublin&#x27;s Eblana Theatre with Cecil Sheridan and Jack Cruise. Other work included pantomime and comedy sketches.

Kelly&#x27;s first film role, which was uncredited, was as a prison officer in &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969), escorting Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) out of prison in the film&#x27;s opening sequence.

He starred in the popular RTÉ children&#x27;s programme &quot;Wanderly Wagon&quot; alongside Eugene Lambert and Nora O&#x27;Mahoney from 1968 to 1982, playing a number of different characters and writing many of the scripts. It was Kelly&#x27;s work on &quot;Hall&#x27;s Pictorial Weekly&quot; (1970–1982) that established him as one of Ireland&#x27;s most recognisable faces. He memorably portrayed councillor Parnell Mooney, a send-up of a backward local authority figure in rural Ireland. In 1974, Kelly won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for his work on the series.

In the early 1980s, he was featured in the RTÉ television programme for those learning Irish &quot;Anois is Aris&quot;. At the end of the programme he spoke into a telephone, gradually introducing Irish phrases. In 1988, he appeared in the Irish thriller film &quot;Taffin&quot;.

==&quot;Father Ted&quot;==
Kelly was best known outside Ireland for playing Father Jack Hackett in the comedy series &quot;Father Ted&quot;, which aired in the United Kingdom from April 1995 to May 1998. Father Jack is an old, alcoholic and offensively rambunctious priest who usually shouts only &quot;feck!&quot;, &quot;arse!&quot;, &quot;drink!&quot; and &quot;girls!&quot; and the occasional scream of &quot;what!&quot; and &quot;women&#x27;s knickers&quot;.

For his role in &quot;Father Ted&quot;, he wore contact lenses (to show Father Jack&#x27;s cataract). People would not eat lunch with him during filming if he was in his Father Jack make-up because the false flaky skin he was wearing would fall off into the food.

Interviewing Kelly in 1997 for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Deirdre Falvey said of him: &quot;In person he could not be further from Father Jack. Urbane, articulate, thoughtful, fit (he swims and hikes), charming company, full of stories, and quite serious, though his conversation is punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter—he is reputably a great slagger with colleagues, and is very well liked.&quot; Kelly himself said:

I like humour—but I&#x27;m very suspicious of people who laugh all the time, because they never listen to what you&#x27;re saying, they always—have another agenda and they generally have no sense of humour. The most untrustworthy body language I know is that of the person who laughs all the time. That terrifies me. People with no sense or a very limited sense of humour I am very wary of too, because it&#x27;s not a sign of great intelligence to be without a sense of humour. If you&#x27;ve no sense of irony you haven&#x27;t a great decision making capacity because you must see the possibilities of the downside of any decision. Without perspective you can&#x27;t have any wisdom, so it frightens me when I meet captains of industry or whatever who have virtually no sense of humour. That&#x27;s the kind of person I find dismaying.
==Later career==
From 1999 to 2001, Kelly starred in &quot;Glenroe&quot; as Maurice and played Henry Doyle (father of Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s Desmond Doyle) in &quot;Evelyn&quot; (2002). He appeared in the film &quot;Rat&quot; in 2000, as a priest called Father Pickle in the TV series &quot;Lexx&quot; (2001), and also in a short film, &quot;Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom&quot;, in 2003. That same year, he had a major role as John Smith, leader of the Labour Party, in the UK Television drama &quot;The Deal&quot;.

In 2007, he acted in the TG4 political drama &quot;Running Mate&quot;, about an election campaign. He also appeared in the TG4 series &quot;Paddywhackery&quot;.

On 29 September 2010, it was announced that Kelly had joined ITV1 soap &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, playing the role of Dermot, Declan Macey&#x27;s father. Kelly left the soap after five months of filming because he missed his family in Ireland.

A regular stage actor, Kelly toured extensively in the United States and Canada. He provided voice-overs and in his television advertising work, appeared with &quot;Mr Tayto&quot; in an advertising campaign for Tayto crisps.

In 2014, he appeared as judge Justice Cannon in &quot;Mrs. Brown&#x27;s Boys D&#x27;Movie&quot;.

In September 2015, Kelly published an autobiography called &quot;The Next Gig&quot;. His reminiscences include those of acting colleagues including Pierce Brosnan and Michael Caine.

==Radio comedy==

Many of his radio sketches originated from his weekday RTÉ radio show &quot;The Glen Abbey Show&quot; in the 1970s until the 1990s. Kelly played the part of a culchie (rural buffoon) called Gobnait O&#x27;Lúnasa. The sketches typically started with the sound of him putting coins in an old public phone&#x27;s coin box, and when the call was answered, his words were, &quot;Hello! Guess who? Is that you Nuala?&quot; Kelly acted the part of an English BBC reporter interviewing rural inhabitants about local customs, such as watching bacon being sliced, or &quot;ha-hooing&quot; (shouting a rebel yell) competitions. The village was called Ballykilferret and described by the BBC man as being in &quot;the Republic of Eer-ah&quot; (a mispronunciation of Éire).

==Music career==
In 1982, Kelly released a single, &quot;Christmas Countdown&quot;, a comedy monologue based on the Christmas song &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; and credited to the pseudonymic Gobnait O’Lúnasa. The monologue is presented as a series of comedic thank-you letters that become more and more deranged as Gobnait slowly goes insane as he receives each of the twelve items from the original song. It reached number eight in the Irish Singles Chart in 1982, and peaked at number 26 in the UK Singles Chart and number 15 in Australia in 1984. 
He performed the single live on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 5 January of that year. The single was the opening track on the later album &quot;Comedy Countdown&quot;.

In 2000 he released &quot;Comedy Countdown&quot;, an album featuring some of his sketches taken from &quot;The Glen Abbey Show&quot;. Tracks included the &quot;Ayatollah Ceili Band&quot; (a pun on The Tulla Céilí Band), &quot;Magnum Farce&quot;, &quot;Incoming Call&quot;, &quot;Festive Spirit&quot;, &quot;Hymn of Praise&quot;, &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;, &quot;Festive Note&quot; and &quot;Siege Mentality&quot;.

==Death==
Kelly died on 28 February 2016, after suffering a heart attack. He revealed he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease in October 2015, and was recovering from bowel cancer. He had previously survived skin cancer.

His death came exactly 18 years after the death of his &quot;Father Ted&quot; co-star Dermot Morgan. Speaking at Kelly&#x27;s funeral, Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland, said, &quot;He will forever be remembered for his roles in the theatre and will be recalled with great affection and fondness for his roles on television, including in &quot;Wanderly Wagon&quot;, &quot;Glenroe&quot; and the much-loved &quot;Hall&#x27;s Pictorial Weekly&quot;.&quot;

Kelly and Bairbre, his wife of 51 years who was a drama teacher, had five daughters and two sons.

<doc id="931888" wikidata="Q448634" url="?curid=931888" title="Press kit">
<text>A press kit, often referred to as a media kit in business environments, is a pre-packaged set of promotional materials that provide information about a person, company, organization or cause and which is distributed to members of the media for promotional use. Press kits are often distributed to announce a release or for a news conference.

==Terminology==

Traditionally, the term &quot;press kit&quot; referred to a set of documents, photographs (such as publicity stills) and other relevant materials packaged together, and such a kit was designed to be sent to a newspaper or magazine as part of an organisation&#x27;s public relations or promotional program. Recently, as print media circulation and readership levels have been declining, marketing and PR people have begun using the broader term, &quot;media kit&quot;, so that it now refers to any promotional material distributed to any media outlet.

A PR media kit should not be confused with an advertising media kit developed by a newspaper or magazine for distribution to prospective advertisers. Advertising media kits typically consist of documents outlining the print media&#x27;s editorial philosophy, detailed profiles of the medium&#x27;s audience, a rate card and information about forthcoming special features.

==Uses==
The press kit or media kit is a public relations staple, and an integral part of a company&#x27;s media relations activities.

Press kits are typically used for:

* Product launches
* New company launch
* Mergers and acquisitions
* News conferences
* Announcements of special events, industry trade shows or exhibitions
* Accompany a press release or media release
* Notify the media of any newsworthy event within a company&#x27;s sphere of activities

==Common components==
There is no universal guide to the elements that should be included in a press kit or media kit, but the following are common components:
* Backgrounder with historical information on the company or individual.
* Fact sheet listing specific features, statistics, or benefits.
* Biographies of key executives, individuals, artists, etc.
* Past press coverage
* Photos or other images (high resolution) of key executives, logos, products, etc.
* A press release detailing the current news the media kit is sent in reference to
* Media contact information (usually of a public relations department or spokesperson)
* A CD, DVD, software title, video, etc. as appropriate for the sender of the release
* Collateral advertising material, such as: postcard, flier, newspaper ad, etc.

===Band press kits===
Musicians, including orchestras, bands and choral groups use media kits when launching a new album or when performing at a special event. Band press kits often have their own unique set of components, including:
* Band biography / History of the band
* CD or DVD
* Video
* Photos – colour or monotone (monotone (black and white) for newspapers; colour for other media)
* Press articles/ reviews
* Notable achievements
* Contact information for the band&#x27;s label, manager, publicist, other representative and links to social media pages

* [Optional] Equipment list (included when the kit is to be sent to a music venue)

==Electronic press kit (EPK)==

An electronic press kit (EPK) is a press kit in electronic form. An EPK usually takes the form of a website or e-mail, though they can also be on CD or DVD. The press kit for the film &quot;Sneakers&quot; was accompanied by a floppy disk containing a custom program explaining the movie and was one of the first electronic press kits by a film studio. The first known EPK, as we know it today, premiered live on the web on January 8, 1995, and was invented and given the exact name electronic press kit or EPK by Andre Gray, the inventor of online music sales certifications and winner of The Johannes Gutenberg Inventor Prize. Gray&#x27;s EPK featured a bio, audio clips, videos, photos, press, set list, basic technical requirements, and a calendar and featured R&amp;B singer and songwriter Aaron Hall as the first artist ever to have an EPK created on their behalf.

===Distribution formats===
Many companies make their electronic press kits available via the corporate website, where kits are typically offered in PDF format. An electronic press kit can be provided via a wide range of digital media and download options.

===Contents===

The contents of an EPK media kit are similar to other types of media kit, but are likely to include a range of audio-visual material. Decisions about what to include in the EPK media kit will depend on the industry and target audience. As a general guide, an EPK in the music industry might contain the following:
* Biography
* Music clips (audio files, CD or DVD)
* High resolution press photos
* Forthcoming tour dates
* Promotional videos
* Offline website or website links, especially links to relevant social media and music websites
* Media reviews and interviews
* &quot;RIYL&quot; or &quot;recommended if you like&quot; list (list of artists in similar styles or genres)
* Contact information
* High resolution, colour photos or images of key executives, the company logo, products, etc.

<text>No Place is a small village near the town of Stanley in County Durham, England, east of Stanley and west of Beamish. Situated to the south of the A693, it is home to an award-winning real ale pub, the Beamish Mary Inn (dating from 1897 and originally known as the Red Robin), and lies near the Beamish Mary coal pit. The local church is known as the &quot;Tin Chapel&quot;.

==Etymology==
The origins of the village&#x27;s unusual name are uncertain; however, theories include a shortening of &quot;North Place&quot;, &quot;Near Place&quot; or &quot;Nigh Place&quot;, or that the original houses of the village stood on a boundary between two parishes, neither of which would accept the village. It could also be a literary play on the word &quot;Utopia&quot;, which comes from the Greek: οὐ (&quot;not&quot;) and τόπος (&quot;place&quot;) and translates as &quot;no-place&quot;. 

The village originally consisted of four terraced houses, known as No Place. In 1937, residents of the terrace of houses to the north, known as Co-operative Villas, demolished these houses, but took on the name for their own village. Derwentside Council tried to change the name of the village to Co-operative Villas in 1983; however, they met with strong protests from local residents at the removal of all signs pointing to No Place. Today the signs say both No Place and (at the request of some residents) Co-operative Villas.

No Place has been noted for its unusual place name. Other unusual place names in the North East include the village of Pity Me (probably a contraction of Pithead Mere, a nearby bog), Bearpark (from &quot;Beaurepaire&quot;, French for &quot;beautiful retreat&quot; – the name of a nearby Norman manor), Wideopen, Once Brewed and Twice Brewed.

== Film references ==
Sharing the village&#x27;s name is &quot;No Place&quot;, an independently produced feature film made in the North East of England and shown at the Cannes Film Festival, subsequently leading to limited distribution at the Tyneside Cinema.

<text>Pauline McLynn (born 11 July 1962) is an Irish character actress and author. She is best known for her roles as Mrs. Doyle in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;, Libby Croker in the Channel 4 comedy drama &quot;Shameless&quot;, Tip Haddem in the BBC One comedy &quot;Jam &amp; Jerusalem&quot;, and Yvonne Cotton in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

== Early life ==
McLynn was born in Sligo, and grew up with two younger brothers in Galway. She studied History of Art and Modern English at Trinity College Dublin, but was more heavily involved in the college&#x27;s drama society. She graduated with an MA.

==Career==
Although McLynn was in her early thirties when playing Mrs Doyle in &quot;Father Ted&quot;, makeup was used to make her look far older to fit the character&#x27;s elderly profile. She received a British Comedy Award for her performances in 1996. The award was presented to her by Tony Blair.

Subsequent televised appearances included a similar elderly role in the &quot;Yesterday Island&quot; episode of youth sci-fi series &quot;Life Force&quot;, sketches on &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;, and panel shows &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, and &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot;. In 1999, McLynn appeared in the film adaptation of &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;. She also appeared in Jennifer Saunders&#x27; &quot;Jam &amp; Jerusalem&quot;. Between 2001 and 2003 she reprised Mrs Doyle in an advert for online tax return filing by the Inland Revenue.

McLynn was critically acclaimed for her performance in the 2005 film &quot;Gypo&quot;, receiving an Irish Film and Television Award nomination for Best Actress.

McLynn appeared in &quot;Shameless&quot;, which was produced by the British broadcaster Channel 4, as Libby Croker. In January 2011 it was announced that she had left the show, reportedly after a &quot;difficult year&quot;.
McLynn also played the role of Alice&#x27;s mother in the Comedy Central show &quot;Threesome&quot;. She starred in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot; at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield in 2011.

McLynn played Mary Whyte in the BBC&#x27;s 2013 sitcom &quot;Father Figure&quot;.

In 2014, McLynn played the part of Evelyn in &quot;Kiss for the Camera&quot;, a series three episode of the BBC comedy Pramface. On 12 May 2014, McLynn joined the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Yvonne Cotton, the mother of Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) and ex-daughter-in-law of Dot Branning (June Brown). After starting as a recurring character, McLynn quickly became a regular when her character&#x27;s storylines escalated. She made her final appearance on 13 January 2015, at the end of her contract. However, McLynn returned to the soap opera on 14 May 2015 for one single episode to give evidence against Dot during Nick Cotton&#x27;s (John Altman) murder trial.

In 2017, McLynn appeared as the mother of lead character Marcella in Roisin Conaty&#x27;s E4 comedy &quot;GameFace&quot;, and in April 2018 she portrayed Sister Mary in the BBC Two biopic &quot;Dave Allen at Peace&quot;. She appears as a minor character named Mrs. Trattner in the 2018 film &quot;Johnny English Strikes Again&quot;.

In 2020, McLynn was one of the celebrity pilgrims on the Sultans Trail in the BBC series &quot;Pilgrimage: Road to Istanbul&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;&quot;.

In 2021 McLynn appeared as Oona in the E4 S6 of &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;. She also appeared as Carol, a bar landlady, in the film &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot;, which was released in October 2021. McLynn also appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as Mary in the New Year&#x27;s special &quot;Eve of the Daleks&quot;.

Since 2018, McLynn has featured as one of three panellists on the RTÉ Radio programme &quot;Sure &#x27;Twas Better&quot;, starring alongside screenwriter Jules Coll, and author and journalist Emer McLysaght, the programme being presented by Will Hanafin.

== Personal life ==
McLynn is married to theatrical agent Richard Cook. She is a patron of the children&#x27;s charity World Vision Ireland and is president of Friends of Innisfree Housing Association.
She is also a patron for Littlehill Animal Rescue, Sanctuary in Ireland and Birmingham Greyhound Protection.

McLynn is a fan of the Premier League football team Aston Villa. She says her best moment supporting Villa came in 1996 when she watched them beat Leeds United in the Football League Cup final with her &quot;Father Ted&quot; co-star Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon, who is a Leeds supporter. McLynn was raised as a Roman Catholic, but is now an atheist.

McLynn is involved with many charities against the racing and export of greyhounds. She is a patron of Greyhound Protection UK.

<text>De Adriaan () is a windmill in the Netherlands that burnt down in 1932 and was rebuilt in 2002. The original windmill dates from 1779 and the mill has been a distinctive part of the skyline of Haarlem for centuries.

==History of De Adriaan==
===Goevrouwetoren===

The windmill was built on the foundations of the Goevrouwetoren by Adriaan de Booys, an industrial producer from Amsterdam. The Goevrouwetoren, or Goede Vrouwtoren (Goodwife Tower), had been the northern support of the city&#x27;s Catrijnenpoort, a defence work over the River Spaarne. By the late 18th century, the gate was redundant due to the expansion of the city, and de Booys bought the tower and the land around it from the municipality of Haarlem on April 24, 1778. By reinforcing the foundations with wooden supporting poles, the mill was built to 34 metres above the level of the river, and above the surrounding city. De Adriaan was officially opened on May 19, 1779.

De Booys was granted permission to build a windmill to produce cement, paint, and tanbark. The windmill was built under the supervision of miller Henricus Ruijsch from Waddinxveen. De Booy earned the concession to be the sole producer of cement in the city for 25 years.

De Booys sold the windmill to Cornelis Kraan in 1802. The monopoly on cement had not been as lucrative as De Booys had hoped for; a competitor evaded the law by importing cement from Dordrecht. The windmill was sold for 1650 guilders, and Kraan converted the mill into a tobacco mill, to produce tobacco snuff. Kraan already owned a tobacco shop, at the Grote Houtstraat (number 12).

In 1865 a steam engine was placed in the windmill by the then owner, J. van Berloo, but this was not a commercial success. In 1925 the windmill was bought for 12,100 guilders by the Dutch windmill society Vereniging De Hollandsche Molen to prevent demolition.

The mill was severely damaged by a storm in 1930.

===Fire===

On the evening of April 23, 1932 the windmill burnt down. The fire brigade arrived quickly but could not prevent the complete burning down of the mill. This event was a shock for many citizens of the city; the cause of the fire has never been established.

===Rebuilding===

Immediately after the fire, citizens of Haarlem collected money to pay for the rebuilding of the mill. The owner of the mill, Vereniging De Hollande Molen, started a collection and the result was 3,000 guilders. The insurance money, 12.165 guilders, had to be used to pay off the mortgage on the mill.

The municipality of Haarlem made 10,000 guilders, a large amount of money, available in 1938 for the renovation of the mill, but this was overruled by the provincial council because of the bad economic situation. The renovation had to be postponed until the economic situation improved (1930s).

In 1963 the Haarlem municipality became owner of the mill and tried to restore it. That failed, however, due to a lack of funds.

In September 1985 a plan was presented by the architects Braaksma and Roos for renovation of the Scheepsmakersdijk; and their plan included a renovated windmill. In 1995 detailed plans were made by the Haarlem municipality and on April 21, 1999, the first pole was put in the ground.

De Adriaan was rebuilt on the original foundations of the old windmill. Windmill De Adriaan was reopened on April 23, 2002, exactly 70 years after the fire. The current owner is Stichting Molen De Adriaan.

==Tourist attraction==
The windmill is fully functional, and is capable of grinding grain. However, it is not often in use - it works for tourists, mostly on Saturdays and holidays. Inside the windmill is a small museum, and the interior can be seen.

<text>William Terence Deary (born 3 January 1946) is a British children&#x27;s author of 351 books, selling over 38 million copies in over 45 languages, best known as the writer of the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; series. Since 1994 he has been one of Britain&#x27;s best-selling authors. In 2012, he was the tenth most-borrowed author in British libraries, and was voted Outstanding Children&#x27;s Non-Fiction Author of the 20th Century by &quot;Books for Keeps&quot; magazine.

==Life and career==
Deary was born in Sunderland. His father Bill owned a butcher&#x27;s shop in Hendon, a poverty-stricken area of the city, and his mother Freda was the manager of a clothing shop. Deary went to Monkwearmouth Grammar School and intensely disliked his school experience, particularly the style of teaching he received. 

He worked as a butcher&#x27;s boy for much of his childhood, helping in the shop from the age of three. He joined the electricity board as a management trainee when he was 18 and later the Theatre Powys drama company in 1972 and as an actor toured Welsh village halls bringing theatre to children. 

He qualified as a teacher at the Sunderland&#x27;s College of Education and taught drama. He was the Theatre Director/County Drama Advisor of the Lowestoft Theatre Centre in Suffolk between 1975 and 1977 – an educationally linked organisation funded by Suffolk Country Council. He began writing in 1976, turning full-time in 1994, with the publication of the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; series.

The &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; series of books are popular among children for their interesting details, vast information and humorous pictures and among adults for getting children interested in history. Books in the series have been widely translated into other languages and imitated. A cartoon series has been made of the series of books and was shown on CITV in 2002. The &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; live action comedy sketch show of the same name has been shown on CBBC since 2009. Deary himself has made irregular appearances on the show.

Deary received an Honorary Doctorate of Education from the University of Sunderland in 2000. He supports Sunderland AFC.

In 2011, he retired from writing children&#x27;s books after 35 years. He lives in Burnhope, County Durham, England with his wife, Jenny, and their daughter, Sara.

It was announced in 2024 that Constable had won the rights to Deary&#x27;s first foray into crime fiction, &quot;Actually, I&#x27;m a Murderer&quot; following a four-way auction.

==Views on education==
Deary is an outspoken critic of schools, which he believes serve no function above keeping children off the street.

Deary has commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve no interest in schools. They have no relevance in the 21st century. They were a Victorian idea to get kids off the street. Who decided that putting 30 kids with only their age in common in a classroom with one teacher was the best way of educating? At my school there were 52 kids in the class and all I learned was how to pass the 11-plus. Testing is the death of education. Kids should leave school at 11 and go to work. Not down the mines or up chimneys, mind, but working with computers or something relevant. Everything I learned after 11 was a waste of time. Trigonometry, Boyle&#x27;s law: it&#x27;s never been of any use to me. They should have been teaching me the life skills I was going to need, such as building relationships, parenting and managing money. I didn&#x27;t have a clue about any of these things at 18. Schools need to change.&quot; Deary has also called to &quot;ban &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; from schools&quot;, because &quot;classrooms take all the fun out of his stories&quot;.

In 2013, Deary spoke out against public libraries, saying that they &quot;have been around too long&quot;, are &quot;no longer relevant&quot; and have &quot;had their day,&quot; and derided the Public Lending Right remuneration to authors for library loans. He argued: &quot;we&#x27;ve got this idea that we&#x27;ve got an entitlement to read books for free, at the expense of authors, publishers and council tax payers... We don&#x27;t expect to go to a food library to be fed. The car industry would collapse if we went to car libraries for free use of Porsches... If I sold the book I&#x27;d get 30p per book. I get six grand, [when] I should be getting £180,000.&quot;

<doc id="931899" wikidata="Q55072099" url="?curid=931899" title="B. Traven">
<text>B. Traven (; Bruno Traven in some accounts) was the pen name of a novelist, presumed to be German, whose real name, nationality, date and place of birth and details of biography are all subject to dispute. It has been claimed that it would be the pseudonym of one Frans Blom, an explorer of Mayan culture. One certainty about Traven&#x27;s life is that he lived for years in Mexico, where the majority of his fiction is also set—including &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1927), the film adaptation of which won three Academy Awards in 1949.

==Life==
Virtually every detail of Traven&#x27;s life has been disputed and hotly debated. There were many hypotheses on the true identity of B. Traven, some of them wildly fantastic. The other name most commonly identified with Traven is Ret Marut, a German stage actor and anarchist, who had edited an anarchist newspaper in Germany called &quot;Der Ziegelbrenner&quot; (&quot;The Brick Burner&quot;). Traven&#x27;s widow Rosa Elena Luján accepted that her husband and Marut were one and the same in a statement after his death in 1969. Marut was a pseudonym and probably derived from Hindu mythology. His career as an actor and later pamphleteer has been traced from 1907 by Rolf Recknagel and in detail by Jan-Christophe Hauschild.

Of all the names given for the author only one has ever been traceable to a documented birth. This was Hermann Albert Otto Maximilian Feige, born in Schwiebus in Brandenburg on 23 February 1882. Will Wyatt discovered from State Department documents in the U.S. National Archive that this name and date was given by Marut to the British police in London in 1923 when arrested as an unregistered alien. This name is not universally accepted but no contradictory evidence has been produced. The Feige discovery is accepted by many authorities.

Traven&#x27;s novels and short stories became very popular as early as the interwar period and retained this popularity after the Second World War; they were also translated into many languages. Most of B. Traven&#x27;s books were published in German first, with their English editions appearing later; nevertheless, the author always claimed that the English versions were the original ones and that the German versions were only their translations. This claim is mostly treated by Traven scholars as a diversion or a joke, although there are those who accept it.

== Works ==
The writer with the pen name B. Traven appeared on the German literary scene in 1925, when the Berlin daily &quot;Vorwärts&quot;, the organ of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, published the first short story signed with this pseudonym on February 28. Soon, it published Traven&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Die Baumwollpflücker&quot; (&quot;The Cotton-Pickers&quot;), which appeared in installments in June and July of the same year. The expanded book edition was published in 1926 by the Berlin-based Buchmeister publishing house, which was owned by the left-leaning trade-unions-affiliated book sales club Büchergilde Gutenberg. The title of the first book edition was &quot;Der Wobbly&quot;, a common name for members of the industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World; in later editions the original title &quot;Die Baumwollpflücker&quot; was restored. In the book, Traven introduced for the first time the figure of Gerald Gales (in Traven&#x27;s other works his name is Gerald Gale or Gerard Gales), an American sailor who looks for a job in different occupations in Mexico, often consorting with suspicious characters and witnessing capitalistic exploitation, nevertheless not losing his will to fight and striving to draw joy from life.

In the same year (1926), the book club Büchergilde Gutenberg, which was Traven&#x27;s publishing house until 1939, published his second novel &quot;Das Totenschiff&quot; (&quot;The Death Ship&quot;). The main character of the novel is again Gerard Gales, a sailor who, having lost his documents, virtually forfeits his identity, the right to normal life and a home country and, consequently, is forced to work as a stoker&#x27;s helper in extremely difficult conditions on board a &quot;death ship&quot; (or coffin ship), which sails on suspicious voyages around the European and African coasts. The novel is an accusation of the greed of capitalist employers and bureaucracy of officials who deport Gale from the countries where he seeks refuge. In the light of findings by Traven&#x27;s biographers, &quot;The Death Ship&quot; may be regarded as a novel with autobiographical elements. Assuming that B. Traven is identical with the revolutionary Ret Marut, there is a clear parallel between the fate of Gales and the life of the writer himself, devoid of his home country, who might have been forced to work in a boiler room of a steamer on a voyage from Europe to Mexico.

Traven&#x27;s best known novel is &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, published first in German in 1927 as &quot;Der Schatz der Sierra Madre&quot;. The book is again set in Mexico, where its main characters are a group of American adventurers and gold seekers. In 1948 the book was filmed under the same title (&quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;) by the Hollywood director John Huston. The film, starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, was a great critical success, and in 1949 it won three Academy Awards.

The figure of Gerald Gales returned in Traven&#x27;s next book, &quot;The Bridge in the Jungle&quot; (&quot;Die Brücke im Dschungel&quot;), which was serialized in &quot;Vorwärts&quot; in 1927 and published in an extended book form in 1929. In the novel, Traven first dealt in detail with the question of the First Nations in South and North America and the conflicting values and traditions between white settler cultures and indigenous cultures throughout the Americas; these themes detailing the problems of colonization dominated what became known as the Jungle Novels published in the 1930s.

The 1930s are mainly the period in which Traven wrote and published the Jungle Novels – a series of six novels consisting of &quot;The Carreta&quot; (&quot;Der Karren&quot;, 1931), &quot;Government&quot; (&quot;Regierung&quot;, 1931), &quot;March to the Monteria&quot; (&quot;Der Marsch ins Reich der Caoba&quot;, 1933), &quot;Trozas&quot; (&quot;Die Troza&quot;, 1936), &quot;The Rebellion of the Hanged&quot; (&quot;Die Rebellion der Gehenkten&quot;, 1936), and &quot;General from the Jungle&quot; (&quot;Ein General kommt aus dem Dschungel&quot;, with a Swedish translation published in 1939 and the German original in 1940). The novels describe the life of indigenous Mexicans in the state of Chiapas in the early 20th century who are forced to work under inhumane conditions at clearing mahogany in labour camps (&quot;monterias&quot;) in the jungle; the working and living conditions lead to a rebellion and the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution.

Traven&#x27;s last novel, published in 1960, was &quot;Aslan Norval&quot;, the story of an American millionairess who is married to an aging businessman and at the same time in love with a young man; she intends to build a canal running across the United States as an alternative for the nuclear arms race and space race. The subject and the language of the novel, which were completely different from the writer&#x27;s other works, resulted in its rejection for a long time by publishers who doubted Traven&#x27;s authorship; the novel was accused of being &quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;pornographic&quot;. The book was only accepted for publication after its thorough stylistic editing by Johannes Schönherr, who adapted its language to the &quot;Traven style&quot;. Doubts about &quot;Aslan Norval&quot; remain and exacerbate the problems of the writer&#x27;s identity and the true authorship of his books.

Apart from his twelve novels, B. Traven also authored many short stories, some of which remain unpublished. Besides the already mentioned &quot;Macario&quot;, the writer adapted the Mexican legend about &quot;The Creation of the Sun and the Moon&quot; (&quot;Sonnen-Schöpfung&quot;, with a Czech translation published in 1934 and the German original in 1936). The first collection of Traven&#x27;s short stories, entitled &quot;Der Busch&quot;, appeared in 1928; its second, enlarged edition was published in 1930. From the 1940s onwards many of his short stories also appeared in magazines and anthologies in different languages.

=== Themes ===
B. Traven&#x27;s major writings are classified as adventure novels with proletarian themes.

An anarchist element of rebellion often lies at the centre of the novel&#x27;s action. The hero&#x27;s rejection of his degrading living conditions frequently serves as motive, and broad emphasis is placed upon the efforts of the oppressed to liberate themselves. Apart from that, there are virtually no political programmes in Traven&#x27;s books; his clearest manifesto may be the general anarchist demand &quot;¡Tierra y Libertad!&quot; in the Jungle Novels. Professional politicians, including ones who sympathize with the left, are usually shown in a negative light, if shown at all. Despite this, Traven&#x27;s books are &quot;par excellence&quot; political works. Although the author does not offer any positive programme, he always indicates the cause of suffering of his heroes. This source of suffering, deprivation, poverty and death is for him capitalism, personified in the deliberations of the hero of &quot;The Death Ship&quot; as &quot;Caesar Augustus Capitalismus&quot;.

In his presentation of oppression and exploitation, Traven did not limit himself to the criticism of capitalism; in the centre of his interest there were racist persecutions of Mexican Indians. These motifs, mainly visible in the Jungle Novels, were unusual in the 1930s. Most leftist intellectuals, despite their negative attitude to European and American imperialism, did not know about or were not interested in persecution of natives in Africa, Asia or South America. It has been argued that Traven deserves credit for drawing public attention to these questions, long before anti-colonial movements and civil rights movement in the United States.

== Identity ==
Traven submitted his works himself or through his representatives for publication from Mexico to Europe by post and gave a Mexican post office box as his return address. The copyright holder named in his books was &quot;B. Traven, Tamaulipas, Mexico&quot;. Neither the European nor the American publishers of the writer ever met him personally or, at least, the people with whom they negotiated the publication and later also the filming of his books always maintained they were only Traven&#x27;s literary agents; the identity of the writer himself was to be kept secret. This reluctance to offer any biographical information was explained by B. Traven in words which were to become one of his best-known quotations: &quot;The creative person should have no other biography than his works.&quot;

The non-vanity and non-ambition claimed by Traven was no humble gesture, Jan-Christoph Hauschild writes: 
The German &quot;Brockhaus Enzyklopädie&quot; devoted an article to him as early as 1934.

<text>Hamish Vigne Christie &quot;Korky&quot; Paul (born 1951) is a British illustrator of children&#x27;s books. He was born and raised in Rhodesia, but now lives in Oxford, England. His work, characteristically executed with bright watercolour paint and pen and ink, is recognisable by an anarchic yet detailed style and for its &quot;wild characterisation&quot;. He is most known for his illustration of the series &quot;Winnie the Witch&quot;.

== Biography ==

Paul was born in 1951 into a family of seven children in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) where he had what he calls &quot;a wild and privileged childhood&quot; in the African Bushveld.

He went to Estcourt High School before graduating from Durban School of Art in 1972 and working at an advertising agency in Cape Town. In 1976, he travelled to Greece where he met James Watt, then working for a Greek publisher who commissioned Paul to illustrate a series of educational books teaching Greek children to speak the &#x27;Queen&#x27;s English&#x27;.

He then spent some time working in an advertising agency in London and Los Angeles, and then studied film animation under Jules Engel at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California. His first children&#x27;s book was a pop-up called &quot;The Crocodile and the Dumper Truck&quot; published in 1980, with paper engineering by Ray Marshall.

In 1986, Paul met the editor, Ron Heapy, at Oxford University Press, who looked at his work and commissioned him to draw several pictures for a short book about a witch written by Valerie Thomas as part of OUP&#x27;s Reading Tree programme. Paul liked the story enough to turn it into a complete picture book. Although this was not strictly within Paul&#x27;s brief, Heapy nevertheless presented it to the OUP delegates. The resulting book, &quot;Winnie the Witch&quot;, went on to win the Red House Children&#x27;s Book Award in 1988 and has since been published in over 10 languages. Paul&#x27;s illustrations for this are full of visual jokes and witty detail. Since then he has illustrated a further nineteen &quot;Winnie the Witch&quot; titles that have sold over 7 million copies.

Of Paul&#x27;s contribution to the success of &quot;Winnie and Wilbur&quot;, Helen Mortimer of OUP writes, &quot;Winnie is such a loved character. It&#x27;s partly because the artwork is so distinctive and detailed; there is so much to pour over in every single spread.&quot; Of his illustration of Winnie in the books, Paul told the Telegraph: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want witchy colours... I love throwing in colour, it makes me feel like Jackson Pollock.&quot;

Three of Paul&#x27;s picture books have been adapted for CD-ROM; &quot;The Fish Who Could Wish&quot; which won the European Multi-Media Award (EMMA) in 1995, &quot;Dragon Poems&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Witch&quot;.

His anarchic yet detailed work, executed with bright watercolour paint and pen and ink, is distinguished by its &quot;wild characterisation&quot;. It has been compared to Tom and Jerry cartoons, and also to the artists Ronald Searle and Ralph Steadman.
He has original artwork on display at The Mazza Collection Galleria, University of Findlay, Findlay, Ohio, US.

Paul lives in Oxford and is married to the artist Susan Moxley. Together they have two children, Oska and Zoë.

Describing the technical details of his work he says: &quot;I use an Apple Mac, Schminke watercolours, Caran d&#x27;Ache pencil crayons (with electric sharpener), Saunders Waterford paper 190gm3 , black kandahar and coloured inks with a dip pen, toothbrush, porcupine quills, and my trusty left hand.&quot;

In 2015/2016, he was the 7th most borrowed illustrator in UK public libraries.

<text>Burnhope is a village and civil parish in County Durham, England. It is located in the Craghead valley on the opposite side to Stanley and has 1,564 inhabitants, as measured in the 2011 census. Burnhope overlooks Lanchester in the Browney Valley, roughly two miles to the west and Maiden Law is roughly two miles north. Holmside is roughly two miles to the south east.

==The village==
Burnhope is a village of contrasts, being home to many of the area&#x27;s poorest and richest people (among them, children&#x27;s author Terry Deary). In 2003 two wind turbines were erected in a field between the village and nearby Craghead, creating a new landmark to accompany the transmission mast. Burnhope is the only place that the Durham Miners&#x27; Gala has been held apart from Durham. This was in 1926 the year of the General Strike when it was banned at Durham so it was moved to Burnhope. In 1986 a 60th anniversary was held to mark this event. 

The school was run in 1921 by William Jacques Warwick, with his wife Emmeline teaching in the Infants Department.

Burnhope has increased in size rapidly within the last few years with over 120 new homes being built by developer, Keepmoat Homes.

== Langley Hall ==

Two miles south-east are the ruins of Langley Hall, a 16th-century fortified manor house. Built for Henry Scrope, 7th Baron Scrope of Bolton it probably consisted of three ranges around a courtyard with a moat. After Scropes&#x27; death the estate passed down his family until Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland, 11th Baron Scrope of Bolton. With Emanuel&#x27;s death in 1630 the hall and estate fell into disrepair.

<doc id="931912" wikidata="Q7502529" url="?curid=931912" title="Shotley Bridge">
<text>Shotley Bridge is a village, adjoining the town of Consett to the south in County Durham, England, 15 miles northwest of Durham.

It is located on the A694 road starting from Consett and Blackhill to the south, then continuing north east to East Law, Ebchester and onward to Swalwell within the borough of Gateshead. Shotley Bridge sits beside the River Derwent which is crossed by the bridge giving the name. A small portion sits on the far bank of the River Derwent to the north west within the county of Northumberland.

Shotley Bridge was once the heart of Britain&#x27;s swordmaking industry.

==History==
There were formerly several fords over the River Derwent near this place and in medieval times a wooden bridge. The present stone bridge was widened in 1820, but its original date is not known.
The bed of the river itself was the source of stone for millstones, and licences for this are recorded at &quot;Shotley Brig&quot; in 1356. 



A water-powered corn mill was established in the 14th century, later replaced by a steam-powered one which was sold to the Derwent Co-operative Flour Mill Society Ltd in 1872, and continued until its closure in 1920. A paper mill was established in 1788 (the first in the north of England) and greatly expanded with mechanization so that in 1894 it had 300 hands (half being girls) and was a major factor in the expansion of the village. However it closed in 1905. 

A well near the village had unpleasant tasting water rumoured to be effective in curing disease and thus known as the &quot;Hally Well&quot; (&quot;hally&quot; = healthy, like &quot;hale&quot;). In 1828 a local entrepreneur John Richardson used this as the basis for a Spa which enjoyed considerable success with the well-to-do, becoming less fashionable as industry grew in nearby towns, but being remade as a playground for workers. 

It was during the Victorian era that much of the town&#x27;s architecture was constructed, including some grand residences and many listed buildings, so that by 1898 it had much of its present form. and a population of over 1000. This also saw the advent of Shotley Bridge railway station (closed 1952) and a gasworks which closed in the 1960s, electric lighting having replaced gas lamps from 1950. The closure of the steelworks at Consett in 1980 caused an economic decline, however since then the village has become more popular.

==Swordmaking==
In the 17th century a group of swordmakers (Oley, Vooz, Molle and Bertram) from Solingen in Germany settled in Shotley Bridge, in order to escape religious persecution. Shotley Bridge was chosen because of the quality of the ironstone in the area and the softness and fast flow of the River Derwent. 

The Oley family were makers of the highest quality swords, rivalling those of Toledo, by using Damascus steel, in great demand during the Napoleonic Wars. They became very wealthy. Their steel production facility was one of the earliest factories for manufacture of steel. The Oley family were involved in the formation of the Consett Iron Company. New weapons and industrialization reduced demand for swords so they diversified into other types of cutlery, but could not compete with Sheffield, and the sword works closed in 1840. Some moved to Birmingham and their business eventually became part of Wilkinson Sword.

Evidence of this industry includes grooves in the stones of the river, the fine house inscribed &quot;Cutlers Hall, 1767, William Oley&quot; and the name of the public house &quot;The Crown and Crossed Swords&quot;. Before the last remaining cottages occupied by the swordmakers were demolished, there was an inscription over the door of the Oley house on Wood Street reading &quot;Das Herren segen machet reich ohn alle Sorg wenn Du zugleich in deinem Stand treu und fleissig bist und tuest alle vas die befolen ist&quot;. This means &quot;The blessing of the Lord makes rich without care, so long as you are industrious in your vocation and do what is ordered you&quot;.

==Places of Worship==
The first mention of a chapel at Shotley is in 1165. This is the site of the (now disused) Anglican parish church, St Andrew&#x27;s, Shotley, which is high on a hill above the town. It is an eighteenth-century Grade II listed building rebuilt in 1892 because of subsidence due to coal workings below. The current parish church is that of St John at Snod&#x27;s Edge, also Grade II listed, dating from 1837 when it was founded as a chapel outpost of St Andrew&#x27;s. There is a Roman Catholic Church, Our Lady of the Rosary (1952), and an Anglican Church, St Cuthbert&#x27;s (1850), designed by John Dobson, in the Benfieldside area south-east of the main town. The Methodist Church was built in 1894, and closed in 2014.

==Shotley Bridge Hospital==
Shotley Bridge Hospital originated with the acquisition of the Whinney House Estate in 1912. The site was initially used as a tuberculosis hospital but served as a facility for the care of people with mental problems being known as &quot;Shotley Bridge Mental Defectives Colony&quot; from 1927 to 1940, when it was converted to an Emergency Hospital to cope with the Second World War, particularly providing plastic surgery, becoming a general hospital in 1948. Although it was once one of the largest of the Northern Region services have been transferred elsewhere, most of the buildings demolished for housing and the current hospital is a much smaller group of modern buildings operating as a community hospital.

==Other Buildings and Public Houses==

In the Victorian boom time, the village was often referred to as a town with such enthusiasm that a Town Hall was actually built in 1860. It is one of several buildings from this period in Neogothic style. Another is Shotley Hall by Edward Robson. There are other grand houses from this period which are some of the many listed buildings in the area. While the Wesleyan Chapel was demolished, its Sunday School remains and is now the Village Hall. The clergyman&#x27;s house (vicarage) is now known as The Manse. The 1876 Temperance Hall is now the Assembly Rooms. &quot;The Crown and Crossed Swords&quot; hotel includes what was once a separate establishment, The Commercial.

The &quot;King&#x27;s Head&quot;, now a social club, sits opposite the Crown and Crossed Swords.

==Other Attractions==
There are a couple of footpaths of note.

One heads west and away from the A694 from close to the King&#x27;s Head, crossing the River Derwent then continuing along the north bank of the Derwent to Allensford and the A68. The path continues beyond this on the south side of the Derwent to Wharnley Burn Waterfall.



The other can be accessed up a set of small stone stairs from the road on crossing the bridge across the Derwent to the right (east). This path leads along the north bank of the River Derwent, through first a large field on the opposite side of the river to the Shotley Bridge Cricket Club, then a small wooded nature reserve including the artificially created &quot;Price Pond&quot; (Google Maps) / wetland and stream, a farm at the top of the following hill, and eventually to the Northumberland hamlet of Newlands. This path has the nickname &quot;Waterfall Way&quot; due to there being one small waterfall on &quot;Mere Burn&quot; and two on &quot;Small Burn&quot; close to the Newlands end of the path. The two near Newlands are also referred to as &quot;Sisterson Falls&quot; with reference to a nearby farm.

The &quot;Derwent Walk&quot; is accessible from Blackhill to the south and from the road to Medomsley heading away from the Crown and Crossed Swords pub and A694 to the east. It also passes north eastward from Blackhill to the south of Shotley Bridge Hospital.

<text>Isla de Aves (; Spanish for &quot;Island of Birds&quot; or &quot;Birds Island&quot;), or Aves Island, is a Federal Dependency of Venezuela. It has been the subject of numerous territorial disputes (now resolved) with the United States (through the Guano Islands Act of 1856), neighbouring independent islands such as Dominica, and European states controlling their nearby dependent islands, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

==Geography==
The island is a part of the Aves Ridge and lies to the west of the Windward Islands chain. It is in length and never more than in width, and rises above the sea on a calm day. Depending on one&#x27;s interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it could be legally classified as a &quot;rock&quot;, which would only give Venezuela a twelve nautical mile economic zone. However, Venezuela claims it is a normal island, which grants it a exclusive economic zone. Mostly sand, a small portion has some scrubby vegetation. It is sometimes completely submerged during hurricanes. It is south-west of the closest land, Montserrat, west of Dominica and north of the Venezuelan mainland.

===Environment===
Mostly sand, a small portion of Isla de Aves has some scrubby vegetation. It is a resting and breeding place for seabirds and a nesting site for green sea turtles. The island, along with its surrounding waters, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of brown noddies and sooty terns.

===Impact of hurricanes===
The island&#x27;s low profile makes it a hazard to navigation, and many ships have been wrecked here. It is sometimes completely submerged during hurricanes. For some time the island has been in danger of eroding altogether, and Venezuelan authorities are considering ways to protect it, along with the territorial claims to the Caribbean Sea which radiate from Isla de Aves. The impact of Hurricane Allen in the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season divided it into two parts, but accretions of coral have subsequently reunited it. On August 17, 2007, the force of Hurricane Dean severely eroded the island.

==History==
The island was most likely discovered by Avaro Sanzze in 1584, though it was not settled. It was subsequently claimed for Great Britain, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. Throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the inhabitants of the Dutch islands Sint Eustatius and Saba regularly visited Aves to collect turtle and bird eggs.

In 1854, a U.S. captain discovered the abundant quantities of guano on Aves and systematic collection started not long after. Both the Dutch and Venezuelan authorities found out and protested. The Dutch sent a warship to Aves. Its captain found Americans loading guano. He informed them that the Dutch considered Aves to belong to the Netherlands.

The island was once again involved in controversy in 1857 when three Boston men, &quot;Mesers Shelton, Samson and Tappan&quot;, were in a dispute with the Venezuelan government after they &quot;annexed&quot; the island &quot;which they had discovered in an abandoned condition&quot;; this was done in accordance with the recently passed United States Guano Islands Act.

In the meantime, in 1859, the Administrator of Sint Eustatius granted a concession to collect guano on Aves to ‘Edward Green, Kean &amp; Co.’ of Baltimore at f. 2.50 per ton. He decided that “&quot;even though Aves was never permanently settled by the Dutch, the inhabitants of Statia and Saba had made use of the island longer than anyone can remember&quot;,” which “&quot;constituted proof of possession.&quot;” He gave a provisionary concession and asked the Governor in Curaçao to confirm. The Governor, meanwhile, had received a request to mine guano on Aves from a group of businessmen on Dutch Sint Maarten, “&quot;who had assured themselves that Aves was recognized as a possession of the Dutch government&quot;.”

The Dutch authorities on Curaçao, under whom Sint Eustatius and Saba fell, sat down with the Venezuelans and together decided to find a mutually acceptable sovereign to decide about the ownership of Aves Island. The Queen of Spain was accepted by both parties, and in 1865 Isabella II ruled on the issue, deciding in favor of the Venezuelans.

However, Isabella&#x27;s judgment acknowledged the time-honoured rights of the inhabitants of the Dutch islands Saint Eustatius, Saba and Sint Maarten to fish in the waters around Aves. As this was the main issue the Dutch had, they accepted the ruling. Later, some Dutch historians argued that Isabella&#x27;s advisors could have mixed up Aves with Las Aves Archipelago lying between Bonaire and Los Roques, just off the coast of Venezuela.

From 1878 to 1912, the island was again occupied by American guano miners until supplies were exhausted.

Isla de Aves was included in Venezuela&#x27;s territorial reorganization done by President Joaquín Crespo in 1895. By 1905, Isla de Aves was a municipality called &quot;Municipio Oriental&quot; part of Colón Federal Territory.

In 1950, a Venezuelan Navy fleet consisting of two patrol boats and one transport boat were sent to take control of the island with a group of soldiers.

On June 2, 1978, ships of the Venezuelan Navy were sent to set up a scientific naval base named &quot;Simón Bolívar&quot; on the lee (west) side near the southern tip of the island, constructed as a platform built on stilts partially in the water, which was permanently inhabited by a group of scientists and military personnel.
===United States–Venezuela Maritime Boundary Treaty===
On March 28, 1978, Venezuela, using Aves Island as its reference, agreed to its maritime borders with the U.S. between Aves Island and Puerto Rico in the United States–Venezuela Maritime Boundary Treaty; this treaty came into force on 24 November 1980 after it was ratified by both parties.

The island is the closest Venezuelan territory to the United States, approximately from the U.S. island of Saint Croix.

===Agreement with France===
On June 17, 1980, Venezuela agreed with France that longitude 62°48′52″ W should be the maritime boundary between Aves Island and Guadeloupe and Martinique.

===2006 Dominica and Venezuela informal agreement===
During a visit to Venezuela, Dominica’s Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, in June 2006, stated that &quot;Aves Island belongs to Venezuela&quot;, unofficially ending the territorial claim.

===Amateur radio &quot;entity&quot;===
Aves Island is a particularly rare amateur radio &quot;entity&quot;, under the ITU prefix YV0. A 2006 expedition by operators to the island required 14 years of planning. Though one member suffered a fatal heart attack, over 42,000 contacts were made during their week-long stay.

<text>Bernard Lietaer (7 February 1942 – 4 February 2019) was a Belgian civil engineer, economist, author, and educator. He studied monetary systems and promoted the idea that communities can benefit from creating their own local or complementary currency, which circulate parallel with national currencies.

==Early life==
Bernard Lietaer was born on 7 February 1942 in Lauwe, Belgium. He attended College of St Paul, Godinne from 1955 to 1961.
He studied engineering at the Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium, where, later in life, he held an assistant professorship of international finance. During his engineering studies, he was a member of the debating union Olivaint Conference of Belgium. After obtaining his M.Sc. in 1967, he went on to 
continue his studies at the MIT until 1969.

==Career==
Lietaer&#x27;s post-graduate thesis, published in 1971, included a description of &quot;floating exchanges&quot;. The Nixon Shock of that same year eradicated the Bretton Woods system by decoupling the US dollar from the gold standard and inaugurated an era of &quot;universal floating exchanges&quot;. Prior to that time, the only &quot;floating exchanges&quot; involved some Latin American currencies. The techniques which he had developed for marginal, Latin American currencies were for a time the only systematic research that could be used to deal with the major currencies of the world. A US bank negotiated exclusive rights to his approach and Lietaer began another career.

In 1987, he co-founded a currency-management firm, called GaiaCorp, and managed the offshore currency fund &quot;Gaia Hedge II&quot;, which during the 1987–1991 period was the world&#x27;s top performing managed currency fund. His biography cites the Micropal survey of 1,800 off-shore funds.

In the preface to his book &quot;The Future of Money: Beyond Greed and Scarcity&quot;, Lietaer claimed: &quot;We almost tripled the money in three years&quot;. &quot;Business Week&quot; named him &quot;the world’s top currency trader&quot; in 1992.

From 2003 to 2006, he was a visiting scholar at Naropa University, USA, where he created the university&#x27;s Marpa Center for Business and Economics.

While at the Central Bank in Belgium, he implemented the convergence mechanism (ECU) to the single European-currency system. During that period, he also served as President of Belgium&#x27;s Electronic Payment System.

In a 2007 interview, Lietaer claimed that diversified, internationally valid currencies can help &quot;address specific needs and enable certain exchanges – whether to fight global warming, promote employment or facilitate education and health care.&quot;

In 2012, he was co-author, along with Christian Arnsperger, Sally Goerner, and Stefan Brunnhuber, of &quot;Money &amp; Sustainability: the missing link&quot;, a publication of The Club of Rome, in which he predicted that &quot;the period 2007–2020 [would be] one of financial turmoil and gradual monetary breakdown.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
At the time of his death, Lietaer lived in Hoyerhagen, in northern Germany.

<text>Sir Sydney Hugo Nicholson (9 February 1875 – 30 May 1947) was an English choir director, organist, composer, and founder of the Royal School of Church Music (RSCM) and the compiler of &quot;The Parish Psalter&quot;.

==Life==
Nicholson was born in London to Sir Charles Nicholson, 1st Baronet, and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth Nicholson ( Keightley). His elder brother was the architect Sir Charles Nicholson; his younger brother was the stained-glass artist Archibald Keightley Nicholson.

Sydney was educated at New College, Oxford before going on to study the organ at the Royal College of Music. He then served as organist at Barnet Parish Church (1897–1903), Carlisle Cathedral (1904), Lower Chapel, Eton College (1904–1908), Manchester Cathedral (1908–1919), and Westminster Abbey (1919–1928). Along with maintaining his organist posts, he edited the &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; supplement that was published in 1916; he did not live to see the 1950 revised edition.

In 1927 Nicholson founded the School of English Church Music (now the RSCM). The School&#x27;s members initially met at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.

One of Nicholson&#x27;s most successful compositions for parish choirs was his &quot;Communion Service in G&quot;, which was widely sung, especially in Anglo-Catholic churches, until recent times. He was warden of St Nicholas College, Chislehurst (1928–1939).

In addition to having edited &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot;, still the standard hymn book in many Anglican churches today, Nicholson wrote several hymn tunes. Of these, the most famous are &quot;Crucifer&quot; for the popular processional hymn &quot;Lift High the Cross&quot; and &quot;Totteridge&quot;. In 1928 he received the Lambeth DMus, and a decade later he was knighted for his services to Church music. He died at Ashford, Kent at the age of 72, and was buried at Westminster Abbey.

<doc id="931925" wikidata="Q17056747" url="?curid=931925" title="International Sahaja Public School">
<text>The International Sahaja Public School in Dharamsala, India is a school run by the Sahaja Yoga movement. The school was founded in 1990.

==Overview==
The school is located in the Himalayas, above Dharamsala in the Kangra district, near McLeod Ganj, at an altitude of more than 1700m. Children coming to the school must have previously been brought up in Sahaja Yoga culture and understand the importance of meditation. Their education is based on the teachings of [H.H.Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi]. Students &quot;learn the basic principles of Sahaja Yoga ... the tenets of Hinduism and worship the school’s patron&quot;.

The medium of instruction is English. Subjects (as followed by the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education curriculum) include standard courses as well as English, German, Indian Classical Music (including instruments), and Indian Classical dance.

==Mixed views==

Judith Coney reports that the school has accepted children from the age of four and notes that &quot;often very young children are separated from their natural parents for prolonged periods, as they usually stay in India for nine months&quot;. An Indian newspaper article published in 2000 reported that students at the time were aged six and above.

An official school statement said that the villagers bring presents to the students and enjoy looking after them. A 1995 report on the school by the Austrian Ministry of Justice has said that uninvited visitors &#x27;dropping in&#x27; have been refused entry

A 2000 article in the Indian Express noted that &quot;an aura of secrecy envelops the school and entry is strictly forbidden.&quot; The article quoted a director of the school as saying &quot;...we don’t like the vibrations to be polluted by outsiders. Sometimes we even tell parents not to come here.&quot; Students are schooled in &#x27;vibratory awareness&#x27; which practitioners say enables them to detect and treat subtle imbalances in themselves and others. This is part of the school&#x27;s vision of fulfilling the students&#x27; physical, emotional, intellectual and, above all, spiritual potential.

According to the school website, Sahaja Yoga education &quot;envisages the development of the child in an atmosphere where the innate qualities, such as innocence and wisdom, are protected and enhanced; where the students imbibe the timeless and unchanging values which come from inner awareness, and are not subject to the vagaries of fashion, religion or national culture.&quot; The Indian Express article noted that the &quot;dormitories are austere, even monastic in appearance&quot;.

They are realised souls, there is God who is looking after them, why are you so much worried about them? Leave them alone! Send them to the Indian school. Then the mothers are sitting there, teachers don&#x27;t like it, no one likes it. They are just gone there. The mothers. No school allows such nonsense! But in Sahaja Yoga they think they have the right. What right have they got? Have they paid for the school? Have they done anything for the school? What right have they got to go and sit in the school? So the discretion should be, we have to bring up our children according to Sahaj culture. The first of the principles of Sahaja Yoga is fortitude. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such ... dainty darlings. You have to be soldiers of Sahaja Yoga. - Nirmala Srivastava

The Austrian Ministry of Justice&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Report on the Sahaja Yoga school&quot; comments that &quot;Despite the altitude, eight months of sunshine a year and outdoor activities and sports in the open, the European children appeared pale which was unexplainable to the visitor&quot;. Coney reports that one child arrived home having lost a stone in weight, and so changed in appearance that his mother could not recognise him, although the school had consistently reported that he was &#x27;doing fine&#x27;.

Coney reports that, &quot;whilst there is evidence that some children have enjoyed their time at the Sahaja Yoga school in India, a number of children have expressed unhappiness at being returned to the India school.&quot; The school advises parents not to enroll their children until they are ready.

Regarding discipline, Sukhmani writes that corporal punishment is taboo at the school. Nirmala Srivastava has advised that parents are allowed to occasionally slap &#x27;extremely difficult&#x27; children, but forbids teachers from slapping children or punishing &quot;in such a way that the child gets hurt.&quot; Coney reports that due to instances of children having been beaten, the Headmaster was temporarily dismissed. The Supreme Court of India banned corporal punishment in schools in 2000.

With thorough investigation of this subject, the students&#x27; reviews have been proven to be trustworthy and this school remains one of the best places for a child&#x27;s spiritual, physical and emotional growth.

==Attitudes of grandparents==

There have been instances of objections by grandparents of children at the school which have resulted in legal action being taken. In Austria, a mother&#x27;s guardianship was partly substituted, after legal intervention of the grandmother, as she was not willing to take her boy out of the Sahaja Yoga boarding-school in India. A French Court of Appeal allowed another mother custody of her children on condition that she did not send any of them to the school, again a result of grandparental intervention.

Coney says these instances are confined to the European continent partly because the anti cult movement there has successfully drawn attention to the differences between Sahaja Yoga and the mainstream, resulting in a media attack on the movement. Coney says in the UK grandparents have been more likely to give parents freedom to bring up children as they wish, in a couple of instances even paying for the child&#x27;s education at the school. The enrolment form used in the admission procedure now asks for details of any resistance from family members to the child studying at the school.

<doc id="931927" wikidata="Q3037397" url="?curid=931927" title="Dots and Loops">
<text>Dots and Loops is the fifth studio album by English-French rock band Stereolab. It was released on 22 September 1997 and was issued by Duophonic Records and Elektra Records. The band co-produced the album with John McEntire and Andi Toma, and recording took place at their respective studios in Chicago and Düsseldorf. It was their first album to be recorded straight to Digital Audio Tape and produced with Pro Tools. The album explores jazz and electronic sounds, and is influenced by bossa nova and 1960s pop music. Its lyrics address matters such as consumerism, the &quot;spectacle&quot;, materialism, and human interaction.

&quot;Dots and Loops&quot; reached number 19 on the UK Albums Chart, as well as number 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States. The track &quot;Miss Modular&quot; was issued as a single and as an EP, and peaked at number 60 on the UK Singles Chart. Several music critics have praised &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; for its blend of accessible music with experimental and avant-garde sounds, and some have considered it to be one of the band&#x27;s finest works and one of the first produced with a digital audio workstation. The album was reissued in 2019 with bonus material.

==Background and recording==
Seven of the ten tracks on &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; were recorded by Stereolab in March 1997 at the Chicago studio Idful Music Corporation with John McEntire, who also produced and mixed the tracks with the band. The remaining three tracks – &quot;The Flower Called Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Prisoner of Mars&quot;, and &quot;Contronatura&quot; – were recorded the following month at Academy of St. Martin in the Street in Düsseldorf, this time with co-production, co-mixing, and engineering duties overseen by Andi Toma. Additional engineering was undertaken by Max Stamm and Toma&#x27;s Mouse on Mars bandmate Jan St. Werner. Stereolab recorded the song &quot;I Feel the Air (Of Another Planet)&quot; for the album, but it was not mixed in time for the mastering process and instead appeared on the band&#x27;s 2000 EP &quot;The First of the Microbe Hunters&quot;.

The &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; sessions marked the first time Stereolab recorded straight to Digital Audio Tape, a process the band found enjoyable. McEntire also introduced the band to Pro Tools. &quot;Digital audio recording seemed like a child&#x27;s toy,&quot; said Tim Gane. &quot;Making lots of little loops of the bass, guitar and the drum parts, not having to play everything through from beginning to end, plopping things in where you wanted them and moving things around to see how it sounded. We loved it!&quot; The extra track &quot;Bonus Beats&quot; from the album&#x27;s 2019 expanded edition also sees the band&#x27;s drummer Andy Ramsay experimenting with a drum machine.

The album&#x27;s title references Norman McLaren&#x27;s 1940 animated short films &quot;Dots&quot; and &quot;Loops&quot;.

==Musical style==
According to AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; is primarily influenced by bossa nova and 1960s pop music. Barney Hoskyns of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found that the album continued Stereolab&#x27;s progression towards a lighter sound that he termed &quot;avant-easy listening&quot;, while Michelle Goldberg of &quot;Metro&quot; referred to it as the band&#x27;s &quot;lounge apotheosis&quot;. &quot;Treble&quot; writer Jeff Terich noted the &quot;more lush&quot; quality of the music on &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; compared to Stereolab&#x27;s previous work, characterising it as &quot;gorgeously orchestrated&quot; art pop.

Erlewine observed that Stereolab &quot;concentrated on layered compositions&quot; on &quot;Dots and Loops&quot;. He described the band&#x27;s interplay on the album as edging &quot;closer to jazz than rock, exploring all of the possibilities of any melodic phrase.&quot; Alex Hudson of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that &quot;if there&#x27;s any krautrock to be found here, it&#x27;s not the motorik pulse of Neu! but the freaky, funky jazz exploration of Can.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Eric Harvey said that &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; exemplified the &quot;recombinant pop&quot; aesthetic that arose in the 1990s, which saw rock musicians embracing the &quot;looped, sampled and collaged&quot; production techniques of electronic and hip hop music. The album frequently makes use of time signatures, including on the tracks &quot;Diagonals&quot;, &quot;Rainbo Conversation&quot;, and &quot;Parsec&quot;.

==Themes==
According to Sophie Kemp of &quot;Vice&quot;, &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; is informed by Stereolab&#x27;s &quot;ideology&quot; of &quot;tackling both despotism and exploring the artistic boundaries of living by capitalism&quot;, with the album seeing the band&#x27;s chief lyricist Lætitia Sadier commenting on &quot;different fears about the world in every track&quot;. Kemp found that these themes are complemented by the album&#x27;s &quot;sprightly spirit&quot;, interpreting the &quot;serene&quot; quality of the music as &quot;a very topical critique on the numbness of society and how the more comfortable we get with capitalism, the more jaded we become to pain and suffering.&quot;

Eric Harvey suggested that the song &quot;Brakhage&quot; concerns both &quot;consumerist desire&quot; and &quot;the sheer amount of studio gadgets required to make the album itself.&quot; Stewart Mason of AllMusic said that the lyrics of &quot;Miss Modular&quot; &quot;sound influenced by the Situationist theory of the &#x27;spectacle&#x27;&quot;. &quot;The Flower Called Nowhere&quot; is about &quot;harbor-bound boats never desiring to &#x27;break free and sail&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Diagonals&quot; discusses &quot;the materialistic escapism of the bourgeois European holiday.&quot; &quot;Rainbo Conversation&quot; is about revolution beginning &quot;in the bedroom&quot;, where &quot;nothing is more political than the personal&quot;. &quot;Refractions in the Plastic Pulse&quot; regards &quot;human interaction amid the spectacle&quot;. &quot;Contronatura&quot; is &quot;a dialogue between friends&quot; which &quot;calls for a quiet rebellion against nature […] and our baser natures&quot;, and later shifts &quot;to a political tract that captures the album&#x27;s mystifying artificial/natural spirit in its final moments&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Dots and Loops&quot; opens with &quot;Brakhage&quot;, which in its first seconds &quot;sputter[s] to life like it&#x27;s being tuned in from outer space on a vintage receiver&quot;, and is afterwards anchored by a two-chord keyboard line and &quot;skittering drum and vibraphone loops&quot;. &quot;Miss Modular&quot; is built on a two-chord pattern augmented by brass arranged by Sean O&#x27;Hagan, and finds Tim Gane using the guitar &quot;as a percussive element&quot; to complement Andy Ramsay&#x27;s drumming. The following track, &quot;The Flower Called Nowhere&quot;, is a &quot;waltz&quot; that &quot;weds a John Barry harpsichord riff with a cosmic MOR melody.&quot; Gane said that the song took inspiration from composer Krzysztof Komeda and incorporates a choral chant from Komeda&#x27;s score for the 1967 film &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;. &quot;Diagonals&quot; pairs a marimba loop with a &quot;mutant-funk jazz drum loop&quot; sampled from Amon Düül II&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;. &quot;Prisoner of Mars&quot;, the album&#x27;s fifth track, has been described as &quot;an Astrud Gilberto-style dreamy drift of a ditty which sporadically yanks up its swooshing skirt of sumptuous melody to reveal ultra-spartan techno-rhumba undercarriage.&quot;

&quot;Refractions in the Plastic Pulse&quot; is a four-part 17-minute track that begins with &quot;all murky vibes, flat Farfisa pads, bossa-nova guitar and Brian Wilson bass&quot;, then &quot;mutat[es] into snarled-up space-rock and metallic junglism – then back to its jaunty original refrain.&quot; &quot;Parsec&quot; is a &quot;samba-flavored drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass track with a peaceful dub break.&quot; The ninth track, &quot;Ticker-Tape of the Unconscious&quot;, opens with a sample of &quot;Divino, Maravilhoso&quot; by Gal Costa and &quot;lays trancey vibes and brass over Stevie Wonder funk&quot;. Album closer &quot;Contronatura&quot; starts as &quot;a chiming, intimate plaint through a thicket of massed, dank nature samples&quot;, and after &quot;a two minute interlude of organic squishiness&quot;, progresses into &quot;a thumping, gelatinous march rhythm&quot;, marking the album&#x27;s &quot;most danceable&quot; sequence.

==Release==
&quot;Dots and Loops&quot; was released on 22 September 1997 in the United Kingdom by Duophonic Records, peaking at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, it was released on 23 September 1997 by Elektra Records, becoming Stereolab&#x27;s first entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, where it peaked at number 111; by August 1999, it had sold over 75,000 copies in the country.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Miss Modular&quot; was issued on 1 September 1997 as a single (on 7&quot; vinyl) and as an EP (on CD and 12&quot; vinyl), reaching number 60 on the UK Singles Chart. The song&#x27;s music video was directed and produced by Nick Abrahams and Mikey Tomkins. The track &quot;Parsec&quot; was later used in commercials for the then-newly launched Volkswagen New Beetle. A remastered and expanded edition of &quot;Dots and Loops&quot;, featuring a second disc containing demos and instrumental mixes of the album&#x27;s songs, was released on 13 September 2019 by Duophonic and Warp as part of Stereolab&#x27;s back catalogue reissue campaign.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Reviewing &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; in 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Kathy Sweeney considered the album a successful move towards a more accessible and &quot;pop-conscious&quot; sound, with Stereolab&#x27;s &quot;avant-garde tendencies and atonal drone of old supplanted by breezy harmonies and, wait for it, tunes.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it &quot;finds them at the top of their game, successfully brokering the seeming shotgun marriage of easy listening and acute intellect.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; writer Stephen Dalton stated that the band &quot;have never sounded so comfortable in a pop setting than on &quot;Dots and Loops&quot;&quot;, which he deemed &quot;both more accessible and more adventurous&quot; than their previous album &quot;Emperor Tomato Ketchup&quot;. Terri Sutton of &quot;Spin&quot; praised the music as Stereolab&#x27;s &quot;most audacious&quot; to date, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Lorraine Ali commented that the band &quot;continues to revitalize Muzak for the &#x27;90s.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau was more critical, finding that &quot;the tunes fall off and the wacky smarts lose the charm of surprise.&quot; At the end of 1997, &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; was named among the best albums of the year by several publications, including &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, and &quot;The Wire&quot;. It also placed at number 28 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

In his retrospective review of the album for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Eric Harvey praised &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; as Stereolab&#x27;s &quot;peak&quot;, finding them &quot;embracing the bleeding edge of digital studio technology&quot; and creating &quot;a work both of its moment and […] that seems to hover outside everything else.&quot; He also considered it to be one of the first albums produced with a digital audio workstation. Louis Pattison of &quot;Uncut&quot; described it as being &quot;a touch less immediate&quot; than &quot;Emperor Tomato Ketchup&quot;, remarking on its &quot;laid-back and loungier&quot; mood, while noting that it captured Stereolab in their &quot;imperial phase&quot;. &quot;Exclaim!&quot;″s I. Khider cited &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; as a &quot;definitive&quot; post-rock recording. Writing for the same magazine, Alex Hudson commended the band for &quot;deliver[ing] some of their most accessible pop without sacrificing any of their experimental impulses.&quot; In &quot;Vice&quot;, Sophie Kemp called &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; &quot;a major milestone in the world of experimental pop, and within Stereolab&#x27;s expansive discography&quot;, deeming it the band&#x27;s &quot;most sonically accessible and politically important record.&quot;

<text>Decksandrumsandrockandroll is the only studio album by English electronic music duo Propellerheads. It was originally released by Wall of Sound on 26 January 1998 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was released by DreamWorks Records with a different track listing.

==Reception==
The album peaked at number 6 on the UK Albums Chart, as well as number 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 1998. As of 1999, it had sold 200,000 copies.

==Uses in media==
&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; has been previously released on &quot;Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project&quot;.

&quot;Take California&quot; was selected by Apple for their iPod debut commercial in 2001. It features a man shaking his head while listening to the track on his Mac, then dragging the song onto the device including his &quot;Favorites&quot; playlist. He puts on his earbuds dancing to the song then leaves. It ends with the iPod wordmark and &quot;Think different&quot; slogan showing up.

<text>Testament is an American thrash metal band from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, the band&#x27;s current lineup comprises rhythm guitarist Eric Peterson, lead vocalist Chuck Billy, lead guitarist Alex Skolnick, bassist Steve Di Giorgio and drummer Chris Dovas. Testament has experienced many lineup changes over the years, with Peterson being the only remaining original member, though they have since reunited with Skolnick, who had been out of the band from 1992 to 2005. Billy has been a member of Testament since 1986, when he replaced original frontman Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza, who had left to replace Paul Baloff in Exodus. Peterson and Billy are the only members to appear on all of Testament&#x27;s studio albums. The band has released thirteen studio albums (one of which is a collection of re-recorded songs), four live albums, five compilation albums, thirteen singles and three DVDs. They are estimated to have sold over 1.4 million albums in the United States since the beginning of the SoundScan era, and over 14 million copies worldwide as of 2016.

Testament is often credited as one of the most popular and influential bands of the thrash metal scene, as well as one of the leaders of the second wave of the genre of the late 1980s, and they are considered a significant member of the so-called &quot;Big Six of Bay Area thrash metal&quot;, alongside Exodus, Death Angel, Lȧȧz Rockit, Forbidden and Vio-lence. By the time they changed their name from Legacy to Testament in 1986, the band had assumed a stable lineup that included Billy, Peterson, Skolnick, and two other founding members, bassist Greg Christian and drummer Louie Clemente; it is often referred to as the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Testament. While the band was initially signed to Megaforce, they were one of the early thrash metal bands to sign to a major label, Atlantic Records, through which they released the band&#x27;s first six studio albums. Their first three studio albums, &quot;The Legacy&quot; (1987), &quot;The New Order&quot; (1988) and &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; (1989), cemented Testament&#x27;s reputation as one of the most successful thrash metal bands, with the latter becoming their first to enter the Top 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

The band&#x27;s next three albums – &quot;Souls of Black&quot; (1990), &quot;The Ritual&quot; (1992) and &quot;Low&quot; (1994) – saw similar success, with the first two charting highly on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while &quot;The Ritual&quot; was supported by Testament&#x27;s only charting US hit &quot;Return to Serenity&quot;. Clemente and Skolnick had both left Testament by the end of 1992, and within the next decade, the band had endured many personnel changes that included guitarists Glen Alvelais, James Murphy, Steve Smyth and &quot;Metal&quot; Mike Chlasciak, bassists Derrick Ramirez (who was originally in Legacy as a guitarist) and Di Giorgio, and drummers Paul Bostaph, John Tempesta, Jon Dette, Chris Kontos, Gene Hoglan, Dave Lombardo, Steve Jacobs and Jon Allen. In 2001, at around the same time Billy was diagnosed with germ cell seminoma, Testament reunited with Souza, Skolnick and Tempesta for the album of re-recorded material &quot;First Strike Still Deadly&quot;. Following Billy&#x27;s recovery from cancer in 2002, Testament resumed activity, and their &quot;classic lineup&quot; briefly reunited in 2005, resulting in the live album &quot;Live in London&quot;; however, Skolnick and Christian would rejoin the band permanently, the latter remaining until 2014. Testament&#x27;s popularity was revived with the albums &quot;The Formation of Damnation&quot; (2008), &quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot; (2012), &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; (2016) and &quot;Titans of Creation&quot; (2020), all entering the Top 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and they have continued to tour consistently. The band is currently working on new material for their fourteenth studio album, which is tentatively due for release in 2025.

==History==
===Early years and first two albums (1983–1989)===
The band was formed in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1983 under the name Legacy by guitarist Eric Peterson and his cousin, guitarist Derrick Ramirez. They eventually hired drummer Louie Clemente, vocalist Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza and bassist Greg Christian, and began playing club shows with bands such as Exodus, Slayer, Anthrax, Lȧȧz Rockit and Death Angel, among others. Clemente left the band in 1985 and was replaced by drummer Mike Ronchette. Ramirez departed soon after and then-teenage guitarist Alex Skolnick, who had studied under Bay Area guitarist Joe Satriani, was brought into the band. Legacy had been writing original material since forming and released a self-titled, four-song demo in 1985. Souza left the band in the following year to replace Paul Baloff in Exodus and was replaced by Chuck Billy at Souza&#x27;s suggestion. Ronchette also left the band, and Clemente rejoined.

The band was signed to Megaforce Records in 1986 on the strength of their demo tape. While recording their first album, the band was forced to change their name to Testament (which, according to Maria Ferrero in the May 2007 issue of &quot;Revolver&quot;, was suggested by Billy Milano of S.O.D. and M.O.D.), as there were already multiple other bands with the name Legacy. Legacy played their last show prior to this name change at the Stone in San Francisco on March 4, 1987.

Testament&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Legacy&quot;, was released in April 1987 on Megaforce Records, and also distributed by Atlantic. They received instant fame within thrash circles and were often compared with fellow Bay Area thrash metal pioneers Metallica. Thanks to this, and the regular rotation of their first-ever music video &quot;Over the Wall&quot; on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, the band quickly managed to increase their exposure by heading out on successful North American and European tours with Anthrax, who were supporting their &quot;Among the Living&quot; album. On this tour, the &quot;Live at Eindhoven&quot; EP was recorded. Testament also opened for Megadeth and Slayer, as well as their then-labelmates Overkill.
Testament&#x27;s second album, &quot;The New Order&quot;, was released in May 1988, and it found the band continuing in a similar vein. The album was a minor success, peaking at number 136 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but managed to sell over 250,000 copies on the strength of the airplay of &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; and the cover version of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault&quot; (through radio and television), as well as relentless touring schedules. In promotion of &quot;The New Order&quot;, Testament supported Megadeth on their &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; tour in Europe, and toured North America with the likes of Overkill, Voivod, Death Angel, Vio-lence, Nuclear Assault, Sanctuary, Raven, Forbidden and Heathen. They also made a number of festival appearances during the summer of 1988, such as Metalfest in Milwaukee, Aardschokdag in The Netherlands, and replaced Megadeth on some dates of the European Monsters of Rock tour, also featuring Iron Maiden, Kiss, David Lee Roth, Great White and Anthrax. By the time &quot;The New Order&quot; tour ended in early 1989, Testament had not only cemented their reputation as one of the most acclaimed thrash metal acts, but had also begun to headline their own tours.

===Commercial breakthrough (1989–1992)===
Testament released their third studio album, &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot;, in August 1989. The album minimized the occult and gothic themes found in the lyrical content of their first two albums, instead focusing on social issues such as politics and corruption, and while staying true to its thrash metal roots, it saw the band drawing influences from traditional heavy metal, jazz fusion and progressive metal. &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; was a commercial breakthrough for Testament, reaching at number 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it was accompanied by three singles – the title track, &quot;The Ballad&quot; and &quot;Greenhouse Effect&quot; – that received significant airplay from AOR radio stations and MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, further helping raise the band&#x27;s profile. Testament toured for nearly a year behind &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot;, performing with numerous bands such as Overkill, Annihilator, Wrathchild America, Mortal Sin, Xentrix, Nuclear Assault, Savatage, Flotsam and Jetsam, Mordred, Dark Angel and a then-lesser known Primus. Despite selling more than 450,000 copies, the album has never been certified gold by the RIAA.

In October 1990, Testament released their fourth studio album &quot;Souls of Black&quot;. Although reviews were mixed, the album managed to sell respectably, in no doubt largely off the strength of the single title track, and saw the band perform on arena tours, including the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies. Testament supported &quot;Souls of Black&quot; with two North American tours, opening for Judas Priest on their &quot;Painkiller&quot; tour from October to December 1990, and Slayer on their &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot; tour from January to March 1991. They also toured Japan, and played shows with Anthrax and Sepultura. Shortly after the &quot;Souls of Black&quot; tour&#x27;s completion, the band released their first VHS documentary &quot;Seen Between the Lines&quot;, containing live clips recorded during the &quot;Souls of Black&quot; world tour, four promotional music videos and video interview segments.

Attempting to reconnect with an audience distracted by the then-emerging grunge movement, Testament released &quot;The Ritual&quot; in May 1992. Recorded at One on One Recording in Los Angeles under producer Tony Platt, it saw a stylistic move away from thrash to a slower, slightly more traditional heavy metal sound, and a somewhat more progressive atmosphere, with the title track being the longest song Testament had recorded up to this point. Drummer Louie Clemente acknowledged this musical change in a 1992 interview with &quot;Deseret News&quot;, explaining, &quot;&quot;The Ritual&quot; is slower and geared toward the old style of metal while &quot;The Legacy&quot; was pure thrash. In fact, every release has been different. We&#x27;ve progressed naturally.&quot; Clemente said in the same interview that Platt&#x27;s involvement within the album helped Testament &quot;get more of a vibe.&quot; &quot;The Ritual&quot; peaked at number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest chart position at the time, and the power ballad &quot;Return to Serenity&quot; managed to receive radio airplay, peaking at number 22 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and it is their only single to peak at any &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Despite selling more than 485,000 copies in the United States, the album has never received a gold certification. In support of &quot;The Ritual&quot;, Testament toured Europe and North America, headlining their own tours, as well as supporting Iron Maiden on their &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; tour, and Black Sabbath on their &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; tour. However, the success of the album did not put an end to the tensions within the band.

===Transitional period (1992–2004)===

For the remainder of the 1990s, Testament had undergone a series of changes in its lineup, as well as a change of pace in its musical style. The first member of the &quot;classic&quot; lineup to leave the band was lead guitarist Alex Skolnick, who performed his last show with them on Halloween 1992. Skolnick has stated that one of the reasons he left Testament was because he wanted to expand his musical horizons rather than continuing to play thrash metal music. Not long after, drummer Louie Clemente left the band.

Skolnick and Clemente were temporarily replaced by former Forbidden members Glen Alvelais and Paul Bostaph (who had recently joined Slayer), respectively. This lineup recorded the live EP, &quot;Return to the Apocalyptic City&quot;, released in 1993. Soon after, Alvelais quit the band and Bostaph departed to focus on Slayer. Their next album, &quot;Low&quot; (1994), featured drummer John Tempesta (formerly of Exodus) and death metal guitarist James Murphy (formerly of Death, Cancer and Obituary). &quot;Low&quot; was a diverse album, featuring various influences such as alternative, death metal, progressive and groove metal, as well as a ballad, &quot;Trail of Tears&quot;. The band&#x27;s remaining fans reacted favorably to the album, although it did little to expand Testament&#x27;s fanbase. Some fans, however, viewed this move away from the mainstream as a liberation that allowed them to expand artistically, not being pressured by sales and success as they once were. Despite the fact that the album charted lower than the band&#x27;s previous three albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 122, its title track &quot;Low&quot; received decent airplay from &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; on MTV and the Long Beach-based radio station KNAC, just before both outlets went off the air in early 1995. Testament toured for over a year in support of &quot;Low&quot;, playing with numerous acts such as Machine Head, downset., Korn, Forbidden, Kreator, At the Gates, Moonspell, Crowbar, Suffocation and Gorefest. Their first full-length live album &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot;, released in the summer of 1995, was recorded during this tour and marked their first release since they ended their eight-and-a-half-year tenure with Atlantic Records.

Tempesta left Testament shortly before the release of &quot;Low&quot; to join White Zombie, being replaced by Jon Dette for the following tour, though the latter would leave the band in 1995. Dette&#x27;s replacement was former Machine Head drummer Chris Kontos. This lineup was featured on the band&#x27;s cover version of Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;. After their 1996 club tour, Christian, Murphy, and Kontos all departed the band. During the time Kontos was in Testament, he suggested the band drop the name altogether and call the band Dog Faced Gods. This idea was turned down by Billy and Peterson who wanted to continue with the Testament name. The two later temporarily disbanded Testament.

The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Demonic&quot; (1997), took a new approach, and found Testament experimenting with death metal more. The album featured Eric Peterson on both lead and rhythm guitar (although Alvelais made a guest appearance, and played on the subsequent tour), early member Derrick Ramirez on bass guitar, and Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan. Hoglan left before the &quot;Demonic&quot; tour to join Strapping Young Lad, with Steve Jacobs doing the South American leg of the tour and Jon Dette returning later. Hoglan&#x27;s loyalty to Strapping Young Lad and his desire to not remain a member of Testament actually came to realization during a published interview the band conducted with &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; magazine.

By 1998, Ramirez, Alvelais and Dette had departed and James Murphy had returned for the band&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;The Gathering&quot;, released in June 1999. The rhythm section on &quot;The Gathering&quot; was highly respected, consisting of metal fretless bassist Steve Di Giorgio (formerly of Death and Sadus) and original Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. The sound of the album was largely a combination of death metal and thrash metal, with a minor black metal influence from Eric Peterson&#x27;s side project, Dragonlord.

Soon after the release of &quot;The Gathering&quot;, Murphy was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Through various fundraisers, Murphy was able to afford surgery and eventually made a full recovery, but was unable to recall anything from the recording of &quot;The Gathering&quot;. In 2001, Billy was also diagnosed with germ cell seminoma, a rare form of testicular cancer, but it only affected Billy&#x27;s lungs and heart. His cancer was also treated successfully. In August 2001, friends of Billy organized the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert, featuring seminal Bay Area thrash metal bands Vio-lence, Death Angel, Exodus, Forbidden, Sadus and Heathen, as well as Anthrax, S.O.D. and Flotsam and Jetsam. The show was headlined by a Legacy reunion, featuring Steve Souza on vocals, and former guitarist Alex Skolnick, who had not played with the band since 1992, and bassist Greg Christian. Also in 2001, Testament released &quot;First Strike Still Deadly&quot;, a collection of re-recordings (with modern studio technology) of songs from their first two albums. It featured the lineup of Billy, Peterson, Di Giorgio, the return of Souza on vocals (for the album&#x27;s last two tracks), Skolnick on guitar, and John Tempesta on drums.

By 2002, Billy had made a full recovery, and the band began performing live again with a new lineup, which included then-Sadus drummer Jon Allen. In 2004, the band changed their lineup once again for their summer festival appearances. Allen was replaced by Paul Bostaph, returning to the band for a second stint after a decade&#x27;s absence. Lead guitarist Steve Smyth departed to join Nevermore and was replaced by former Halford guitarist &quot;Metal&quot; Mike Chlasciak. Shortly after Smyth&#x27;s departure, Peterson fell down a flight of stairs, breaking his leg, and was unavailable for some dates; he was temporarily replaced by Smyth.

===Reunion of &quot;classic lineup&quot; and &quot;The Formation of Damnation&quot; (2005–2010)===

In May 2005, it was announced that Testament would be doing a brief European reunion tour – known as the &quot;10 Days in May Tour&quot; – featuring the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Billy, Peterson, Skolnick and Christian, with drum duties shared between John Tempesta and Louie Clemente. After the success of the initial tour dates, Testament announced more dates in the U.S., Europe, and Japan with the classic lineup. Later that year, Skolnick also toured the East Coast with Trans-Siberian Orchestra. The band went on to release a live DVD and CD from the tour entitled &quot;Live in London&quot;. In interviews on the DVD, Eric Peterson expressed his desire to record the follow-up to &quot;The Gathering&quot; with the &quot;classic&quot; Testament lineup. He also stated that Skolnick had begun writing songs for a new album. Chuck Billy was very vocal about how happy he was to have Skolnick, Christian, Clemente, and Tempesta in the band once again, and hoped to maintain a stable lineup going forward. Also in 2005, Testament&#x27;s long-out of print documentary &quot;Seen Between the Lines&quot; was released on DVD for the first time.

Testament played for the first time in the Middle East at the Dubai Desert Rock festival in March 2006. Other notable bands that performed at the Desert Rock festival were Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Reel Big Fish and 3 Doors Down.

In July 2007, the band played a show at Jaxx Nightclub in Springfield, Virginia, with Paul Bostaph filling in on drum duties. It was later confirmed that Bostaph would be officially returning to the band to record a new album. The band debuted a new song at that show titled &quot;The Afterlife&quot;, which they also played at Earthshaker Fest.

In February 2008, Testament released the song &quot;More Than Meets the Eye&quot; from its then-upcoming album &quot;The Formation of Damnation&quot; on their Myspace page. &quot;The Formation of Damnation&quot;, their first studio album in seven years (and first with all-new material in nine years), was released two months later through Nuclear Blast Records. It was the first Testament album to feature Alex Skolnick on guitar since 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Ritual&quot;, and the first to feature bassist Greg Christian since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot;.

Testament toured for more than two years in support of &quot;The Formation of Damnation&quot;. The band performed the main event on the first day of &quot;Gillmanfest&quot;, a rock festival to be held on May 24, 2008, in Valencia, Venezuela, visiting Colombia for the second time in the band&#x27;s extensive career. In June 2008, Testament headlined the 3rd stage at Download Festival, held at Donington Park, and a month later, they played at Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s Monsters of Rock festival in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The band also toured North America as a supporting act for Judas Priest, Heaven &amp; Hell, and Motörhead on the Metal Masters Tour. The band announced that they had recruited guitarist Glen Drover (ex-Megadeth and King Diamond) to fill in on their upcoming Mexican tour dates with Judas Priest, due to Alex Skolnick&#x27;s prior commitment to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Testament would embark on the &quot;Priest Feast&quot; European tour with headliners Judas Priest and Megadeth in February and March 2009. On March 25, 2009, Testament played a special one-off show at the O2 Islington Academy in London, where they performed their first two albums (&quot;The Legacy&quot; and &quot;The New Order&quot;) back-to-back, with British thrash band Sylosis in support. Also in 2009, Testament set out on a 6-week tour across the US to promote &quot;The Formation of Damnation&quot;, touring with Unearth and Lazarus A.D. In early 2010, Testament toured the United States with Megadeth and Exodus. Alex Skolnick did not participate in the tour due to previous obligations and Glen Drover again filled in for him. In the summer of 2010, the band toured Australia, and supported Megadeth and Slayer on the American Carnage Tour. Testament also headlined for the first time in the Philippines for the annual Pulp Summer Slam on April 17, 2010 with Lamb of God.

===&quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot; (2010–2013)===

As early as 2009, Testament began writing new material for their eleventh album. In an interview with Metalheadz, Peterson stated that there were about four songs written and that &quot;there&#x27;s other guys in the band who like to play the more rock melodic style but the next one is gonna be a bit heavier.&quot; In a January 2011 interview during the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise, Billy revealed that Testament had been working on six new songs, with four or five &quot;maybe left to write,&quot; and would begin recording their new album by early March. On May 18, 2011, Skolnick posted an update on his Twitter, saying, &quot;Another tune done! My riffs from last week [plus] some of [fellow Testament guitarist Eric Peterson&#x27;s] plus new ones we wrote today. Planning one more, then we&#x27;ve got more than we need.&quot;

Testament began recording their eleventh studio album on June 20, 2011. Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a &quot;serious injury&quot;, although he was expected to rejoin when the band began touring to support the album. Bostaph was replaced by Gene Hoglan, who had played drums with Testament on their 1997 album &quot;Demonic&quot;.

Testament appeared at the California dates of the summer 2011 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival as the replacement of In Flames.

The band toured in the fall of 2011 with Anthrax and Death Angel. Overkill was invited to the tour, but due to the pre-production of their sixteenth studio album &quot;The Electric Age&quot;, they did not participate. John Tempesta filled in for Bostaph on the tour. It was announced on December 1, 2011 that Bostaph had once again left Testament. Gene Hoglan, who had recorded the drum tracks for the new album, was brought back after the band had expressed pleasure in his playing, hoping that he would continue with the band for the foreseeable future.

After many delays, the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot; was released on July 27, 2012. The album debuted at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their highest chart position to date. Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler made a guest appearance on the bonus track &quot;A Day in the Death&quot;.

===&quot;Dark Roots of Thrash&quot; and &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; (2013–2019)===
In August 2012, Peterson stated that Testament would record a twelfth studio album if &quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot; did well. A week prior to the release of &quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot;, Billy promised that Testament would not take &quot;huge gaps&quot; between albums anymore, and would &quot;work hard and tour for two years or so,&quot; and try to release another album when they could. Hoglan had also said that he would &quot;absolutely dig&quot; to be a part of the songwriting of the next Testament album.

On September 13, 2013, Billy told Rock Overdose that from January to April 2014, Testament would be writing and recording their eleventh studio album for a 2014 release. Testament released a live DVD/double album &quot;Dark Roots of Thrash&quot; on October 15, 2013. The release documents the band&#x27;s sold-out headlining performance at the Paramount in Huntington, New York, in February 2013.
In January 2014, bassist Greg Christian left Testament again, and was replaced by a returning Steve Di Giorgio. Christian has stated that the reasons behind his departure were because of money disputes and differences with the band.

When asked in an April 2015 interview about Testament&#x27;s plans to begin recording their twelfth album, Peterson said that his &quot;main goal&quot; was to &quot;get home [from tour] in June, finish it up and get in the studio by September.&quot; Billy also said that the band&#x27;s goal was to have the album finished by Thanksgiving. Slovenian bassist Tilen Hudrap (Pestilence, U.D.O., Vicious Rumors, Paradox, Doro (live), Thraw...) and Bay Area drummer Alex Bent (Arkaik, Hatriot, Decrepit Birth and Battlecross) filled in for Di Giorgio and Hoglan respectively at the prestigious Canadian open-air festival Heavy Montréal in August 2015, which was attended by more than 70,000 spectators. Other bands that appeared with Testament on the 2015 edition of HMTL were Gojira, Lamb of God, Slipknot, Faith No More, Neurosis, Arch Enemy, Abbath, Ihsahn etc.
Both Hudrap and Bent continued to work with Eric Peterson and appeared on his solo single &quot;Winter Sun&quot;, released in December 2015, as well as on the Dragonlord studio album &quot;Dominion&quot;. Hudrap later joined the iconic German singer Udo Dirkschneider, while Bent joined Trivium. 

In May 2016, Billy confirmed their twelfth album would be called &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot;. Of the album&#x27;s lyrical content, he commented, &quot;The Brotherhood of the Snake was actually a society about 6,000 years ago that debarred all religions. It was just a fascinating topic that caught our eye and attention and spawned a lot of songs. We&#x27;re going with that vibe. There will be some songs that deviate, but the majority will be around that and aliens and religion. Then I&#x27;ll probably tap into my native heritage and write some songs about that. It&#x27;s not just going to be one concept, but there is some interesting stuff that we&#x27;re finding to write about.&quot; &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; was released on October 28, 2016, and received generally positive reviews from critics, and scored Testament their second-highest chart position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number twenty. Shortly after its release, Testament embarked on an international tour with Amon Amarth, and toured North America in April–May 2017 with Sepultura, Prong, Infernal Tenebra and Dying Gorgeous Lies. The band also toured Europe with Annihilator and Death Angel in November and December 2017, and again in March and April 2018, with Annihilator and Vader supporting. Along with Anthrax, Lamb of God, Behemoth and Napalm Death, Testament opened for Slayer on their final North American tour, which took place throughout the spring and summer of 2018. Testament also performed at Megadeth&#x27;s first-ever cruise called Megacruise in October 2019.

===&quot;Titans of Creation&quot; and upcoming fourteenth studio album (2019–present)===
By March 2017, Testament had begun writing the follow-up to &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot;, with plans to release it in 2018. Billy stated in March 2018 that Testament would start working on their thirteenth studio album after they finish touring in support of &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; in August, hoping not to repeat the four-year gaps between their last three albums. He later stated that opening for Slayer on their farewell tour would be &quot;the final lap for [them] touring&quot; in support of &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot;. Work on the follow-up album began in February 2019, and pre-production began in May with Andy Sneap as the mixer. Drummer Gene Hoglan revealed in a June 2019 interview on the &quot;Talk Toomey&quot; podcast that the band had finished recording the album for a 2019 or early 2020 release. Peterson later stated that it would be released in January 2020.

The band, along with Exodus and Death Angel, took part in The Bay Strikes Back tour of Europe in February and March 2020. Following the tour, Chuck Billy and his wife Tiffany tested positive for COVID-19, making him the third person to have contracted the virus during the tour following Will Carroll of Death Angel and Gary Holt of Exodus. Bassist Steve Di Giorgio was later diagnosed with COVID-19, becoming the second member of Testament to have tested positive for the condition.

Testament released their thirteenth studio album &quot;Titans of Creation&quot; on April 3, 2020. They were due to headline a North America tour to promote the album, with support provided by The Black Dahlia Murder, Municipal Waste and Meshiaak, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, Testament did not tour in support of &quot;Titans of Creation&quot; for over a-year-and-a-half; touring for the album was scheduled to start in the fall of 2021, with the band resuming their Bay Strikes Back tour in North America with Exodus and Death Angel, but the COVID-19 pandemic led to its postponement to the spring of 2022. Following this was a summer European tour, which included festival appearances, as well as headlining dates with Exodus, Death Angel and Heathen, and one with Sepultura, and then the second North American leg of the Bay Strikes Back tour in the fall. The band also co-headlined the Klash of the Titans tour in Latin America with Kreator in the spring of 2023, followed by a European tour with Voivod, and dates in Asia with Exodus and Death Angel. On some dates of the latter tour, Phil Demmel (formerly of Vio-lence and Machine Head) stepped in for guitarist Alex Skolnick, as the latter had sat out in order to tend to a family emergency.

In a May 2020 interview with Exodus and former Legacy frontman Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza on his &quot;Toxic Vault&quot; video channel, Billy was asked if he was going to write another Testament album during the COVID-19 pandemic. His response was, &quot;We&#x27;re not writing a record yet. I won&#x27;t release what we&#x27;re doing, but we are gonna write some stuff. Just to do something, not a record but maybe something just to have some singles.&quot; In a July 2020 interview with Australia&#x27;s Riff Crew, Billy commented on his take on the possibility of writing another Testament album during the pandemic, saying, &quot;Well, if it is truly, as someone says, a two-year period, of course, we&#x27;re gonna go write another record, and when it all settles, we&#x27;ll have two records… And if it had to be that long, then, yeah, we would probably consider just writing another record.&quot; Peterson reiterated Billy&#x27;s comments in September 2020 that the band could work on new material before beginning to tour in support of &quot;Titans of Creation&quot;. In a March 2021 interview on Alive &amp; Streaming, an internet podcast hosted by Death Angel guitarist Ted Aguilar, Billy confirmed that Peterson has been writing new material for what could result in the next Testament album.

On January 21, 2022, the band and longtime drummer Gene Hoglan announced on their respective social media accounts that he had once again left Testament to pursue &quot;an exciting new chapter of [his] career and free agency, with all that it will entail.&quot; On March 1, it was announced that drummer Dave Lombardo had rejoined the band in time for the North American leg of The Bay Strikes Back tour, which became Testament&#x27;s first major outing with Lombardo, who had left the band before the 1999–2000 tour for &quot;The Gathering&quot;. The band later discussed the possibility of recording a new album with Lombardo, and Billy stated in September 2022 that the band would likely begin work on it after the conclusion of The Bay Strikes Back tour. He later stated that he hoped they would begin recording their new album towards the end of 2023 for a 2024 release. When asked in a June 2023 during their appearance at Hellfest when the album would be recorded, Peterson said, &quot;Hopefully maybe October, November. If not, probably January, February. But we&#x27;re shooting for this year — at the end of the year. I think I&#x27;ll be done writing in September. So we just have to wait for vocals. Which can take a while. But we&#x27;ll see what happens.&quot; It was announced the same month that Testament had renewed their deal with Nuclear Blast for three more albums, and the label had acquired the rights to the band&#x27;s first six studio albums for future reissues. Work on the new album resumed in July 2023, with Peterson describing its direction as a combination of thrash, NWOBHM, &quot;thrash black [and] heavy hard rock blues&quot;, and it was announced nearly two weeks later that the songwriting process of the album had begun. By December 2023, Testament had begun tracking their new album with mastering engineer Justin Shturtz at Sterling Sound in Nashville, but progress was slow, with Di Giorgio confirming in March 2024 that pre-production on the album had begun, and Billy revealing in June that &quot;most of the drums&quot; were recorded. The band members later announced that their new album would not be released until 2025.

In April 2023, Lombardo announced that he would not be joining Testament throughout their 2023 tour dates, giving scheduling conflicts as the reason and expressing uncertainty that he would return to the band afterwards. He was officially replaced by former Seven Spires drummer Chris Dovas, who had previously filled in for Lombardo for a few U.S. dates the previous fall.

Testament released remastered versions of &quot;The Legacy&quot; and &quot;The New Order&quot; on July 12, 2024. In support of those remasters, the band co-headlined the North American leg of the Klash of the Titans tour with Kreator in September–October 2024 (with Possessed as the supporting act), followed by a Europe that November–December, where Testament opened for Kreator and Anthrax. Prior to those tours, they supported Behemoth on their O Father, O Satan, O Svmmer European tour during the summer of 2024.

==Legacy and influence==
Inspired by the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) and local Bay Area music scenes, Testament has been credited as one of the leaders of the second wave of thrash metal in the late 1980s, as well as one of the most influential Bay Area thrash metal bands. In a 2021 &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine fan poll, Testament was voted number one as best non-&quot;Big Four&quot; thrash band. AllMusic referred to them as &quot;one of the first thrash acts to emerge from the Bay Area in Metallica&#x27;s wake during the &#x27;80s.&quot; Testament is considered to be part of the &quot;Big Eight&quot; of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Overkill and Death Angel.

Numerous hard rock and heavy metal acts, such as Aerosmith, AC/DC, Angel Witch, Black Sabbath, Boston, Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Dio, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Mercyful Fate, Metallica, the Michael Schenker Group, Montrose, Ozzy Osbourne (particularly the Randy Rhoads-era), Raven, Samson, Saxon, Scorpions, Slayer, the Sweet, Thin Lizzy, UFO (particularly the Michael Schenker-era), Van Halen, Venom and Watchtower, have been cited as an influence or inspiration to Testament&#x27;s music. The band&#x27;s other musical influences or inspirations include the Beatles, as well as guitarists/vocalists Jeff Beck, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Yngwie Malmsteen, Frank Marino, Mahogany Rush, Pat Travers and Johnny Winter.

Testament has influenced multiple bands from different genres, including Pantera, Sepultura, Death Angel, Annihilator, White Zombie, Korn, Machine Head, Drowning Pool, Kataklysm, Lamb of God, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Entombed, Gojira, Killswitch Engage, Exhorder, Havok, Evile, Blind Guardian, Sevendust, Suicidal Angels, Trivium, Nightwish, Shadows Fall, Terror, Unearth, Skeletonwitch, Warbringer, Primal Fear, Fight, Sons of Texas, Incite, Demolition Hammer, and Forced Entry.

In the video for Bowling for Soup&#x27;s &quot;Punk Rock 101&quot;, guitarist and vocalist Jaret Reddick can be seen wearing a Testament t-shirt.

<doc id="931938" wikidata="Q1499983" url="?curid=931938" title="Snøhvit">
<text>Snøhvit &quot;()&quot; is the name of a natural gas field in the Norwegian Sea, situated northwest of Hammerfest, Norway. The northern part of the Norwegian Sea is often described as the Barents Sea by offshore petroleum companies. &quot;Snøhvit&quot; is also the name of a development of &quot;Snøhvit&quot; and the two neighbouring natural gas fields &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Askeladden&quot;. Estimated recoverable reserves are 193 billion cubic metres of natural gas, of condensate (light oil), and 5.1 million tonnes of natural gas liquids (NGL). The development comprises 21 wells. The Snøhvit development is operated by Equinor on behalf of six gas companies owning licenses:
* Petoro 
* TotalEnergies
* Engie 
* Equinor 
* Hess 
* RWE Dea

The fields were discovered in 1984. The development plan was presented by Statoil in 2001, with production starting in 2006. A subsea production system was planned to feed a land-based plant on the island of Melkøya via long submarine gas pipeline with diameter of . The gas from Snøhvit was to be used for liquefied natural gas (LNG) production. The total costs of field development will be around NOK 34.2 billion. The LNG plant will emit 920 thousand tonnes of  each year, an increase of Norway&#x27;s total emissions by almost 2%.

The annual export capacity is 5.75 billion cubic metres of LNG, 747 thousand tonnes of condensate and 247 thousand tonnes of liquified petroleum gas. Long-term export contracts have been signed with Iberdrola in Spain and El Paso in the USA.

The field also holds limited amounts of crude oil. The recent discovery of the nearby Goliat oil field has made the oil reserves at Snøhvit more exploitable.

The development of Snøhvit sparked political controversy in Norway, as it was the first discovery in the Barents Sea to be developed. Environmental groups like Natur og Ungdom and Bellona argued that the Barents Sea is too sensitive for oil and gas production, and that the Melkøya LNG plant would drastically increase Norway&#x27;s emissions. In the summer of 2002, protesters from Natur og Ungdom were arrested by the police after blocking the construction of the LNG plant at Melkøya for 10 days.

==Geology==
The reservoir resides in three fault blocks located in the Hammerfest Basin and consists of Lower to Middle Jurassic sandstones.

==Carbon Capture and Storage==

The Snøhvit gas field uses Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to avoid some emissions from gas processing. Gas from the Snøhvit field contains between 5 and 8 percent carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is separated in the Hammerfest LNG plant on the island of Melkøya, transported back into the gas field, and injected into geological formations. This project has the capacity to store around 0.7 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Those emission savings are relatively small compared to the emissions generated by the LNG exported from Snøhvit, which are around 13 million tons.

In 2022, Equinor had announced plans for reinvestments at the Hammerfest LNG plant, including electrification of processes previously powered by fossil gas. The electrification project was controversially discussed, and using carbon capture and storage to avoid these additional emissions was proposed as an alternative. However, according to Equinor, doing so would have been extremely expensive.

Equinor expected costs of around 6,500 Norwegian kroner per ton of carbon dioxide avoided, which is much higher than usual cost estimates for CCS. Equinor proceeded with the electrification project, and it was approved by the Norwegian government in August 2023.

<doc id="931941" wikidata="Q1795027" url="?curid=931941" title="Philles Records">
<text>Philles Records was an American record label formed in 1961 by Phil Spector and Lester Sill, the label taking its name from a hybrid of their first names. Initially, the label was distributed by Jamie/Guyden in Philadelphia. In 1962, Spector purchased Sill&#x27;s stock to become sole owner at 21 years of age, America&#x27;s youngest label chief at the time.

==Founding and background==
The label issued 12 albums over the course of its existence, but with the exception of &quot;A Christmas Gift for You&quot;, the focus was always on the single. However, Philles X-125 is a reissue of Philles 119, and X-125 exists with two different B-side tracks, as &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; (1964) and &quot;Winter Blues&quot; (1965) were substituted for the original flipside, &quot;Harry and Milt Meet Hal B&quot; (1963). &quot;Harry and Milt&quot; and many other flipsides were deliberately undistinguished instrumentals, which were intended to focus attention on the A-sides. These B-sides were originally credited to the A-side artists, but later pieces were credited to the Phil Spector Group. Also, most discographies, including the one in the &quot;Back to Mono&quot; booklet, list two items with catalogue number Philles 123. &quot;Stumble And Fall&quot; by Darlene Love was released and then withdrawn (both stock and promos exist) in August 1964 (according to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine). Its number was replaced with &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; by The Ronettes, which came out that October. Philles 111 also has two B-sides: &quot;My Heart Beat a Little Bit Faster&quot; and &quot;Playing for Keeps.&quot; The last few singles (134, 135, and 136) received much less airplay than their predecessors. Although singles 134 and 135 were &quot;charted&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, single 136 did not—although both promo and regular stock copies exist. The promotion-only single &quot;(Let&#x27;s Dance) The Screw&quot; by The Crystals is known only in the form of a handful of promotional copies and one stock copy.

After the chart failures of the last few singles, Phil Spector stopped producing and releasing new records on Philles. In the summer of 1966, he signed Bob Crewe and Jeff Barry to produce The Ronettes and Ike &amp; Tina Turner. The label effectively ceased operations in 1967, and Spector did not return to production work for another two years. There was one more Philles record, &quot;The Phil Spector Spectacular.&quot; It was released only to radio stations in 1972, along with a letter from Phil. The Philles catalog is now administered by Sony Music Publishing, which acquired the catalogue when it bought EMI Music Publishing, with Sony Music&#x27;s Legacy Recordings imprint handling distribution rights for the Philles catalog through a new licensing deal which was finalized in September 2009. Prior to this deal, the Philles reissues were handled by ABKCO Records.

=== Production ===
The singles were produced by Spector, with five and one half exceptions: Philles 101, 103, and 104 were produced by Lester Sill prior to his departure from the company; Philles 133 by Jeff Barry; Philles 134 by Bob Crewe; and the B-side of Philles 136 was produced by Ike Turner. For years, The Righteous Brothers&#x27; Bill Medley has insisted that he produced &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; (Philles 129) but that has never been confirmed: as an album track for &quot;Just Once in My Life&quot;, Spector delegated production of such tracks to Medley. As the B-side to &quot;Hung On You&quot;, early presses did not specify its producer on the label – Spector usually produced throwaway instrumentals on the B-side to focus on the A-side. When the track boomed in popularity, Spector eventually opted to claim credit in later presses. 

Of the non-Spector productions, only &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; charted and it rose no higher than 100th place. Every one of Spector&#x27;s productions made the charts in the U.S., with the exceptions of Philles 136, one of the two Philles 123&#x27;s, the withdrawn Philles 105, and the holiday single both times. Eighteen Philles records made the Top 40, the label topping the charts twice with Philles 106 in 1962, and again with Philles 124 in 1965.

<text>Enigma Records (also known as Enigma Entertainment Corporation) was a popular rock and alternative American record label in the 1980s.

==History==
Enigma Records launched as a division of Greenworld Distribution, an independent music importer/distributor, in 1981. Four years later, in 1985, Enigma severed ties with Greenworld and became its own company. Enigma was initially located in Torrance, California, then El Segundo, California and finally Culver City, California. Enigma was founded and run by brothers William and Wesley Hein. Jim Martone joined the company in 1984. Enigma focused on punk rock, alternative, and heavy metal music though it also released techno (Synthicide Records), jazz (Intima Records) and classical music (Enigma Classics) through subsidiary labels.

The label&#x27;s first release was Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot;. The album was initially released under the band&#x27;s own Leathür Records imprint but manufactured, marketed and distributed by what would become the Enigma Records team. After the band moved on to Elektra Records, the Enigma Records name was adopted and all subsequent artists were released under this new name. Enigma&#x27;s next major success was with the pop band Berlin.

Enigma Records was initially distributed through independent record importers/distributors such as Jem Records and Important Records. In 1984, Enigma entered into a joint venture with EMI America to sign and develop new artists. Among the artists signed under the venture were the Red Hot Chili Peppers and SSQ (later renamed Stacey Q and signed to Atlantic Records). In 1986, Enigma moved its distribution to Capitol/EMI, a major record label, while leaving its Restless Records division with the independent distributors that had previously distributed Enigma. Poison, a glam rock band, and The Smithereens were two of the first artists released under the joint Enigma / Capitol relationship, both of which had significant success. That same year it launched a music video line, which was also distributed by Capitol.

One of Enigma&#x27;s biggest commercial successes was with the Christian rock band Stryper, which had several gold and platinum records on the label as well as significant international success.

In addition to the primary Enigma Records label, the company had two smaller subsidiary labels as well as a music publishing company (La Rana / El Porto Music administered by Bug Music). Enigma Retro focused on re-issues of material licensed from other labels such as Straight Records, Bizarre Records, and DiscReet Records. The Restless Records division focused on alternative artists not intended for major label distribution. Enigma also released film soundtracks including &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot;. Enigma released a compilation album, &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;, with various artists. Enigma had a joint venture with Mute Records and released certain Mute titles in the United States. Sonic Youth&#x27;s landmark 1988 album &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; was originally released on Enigma Records, in association with Blast First Records.

Enigma was formally acquired by Capitol/EMI in 1989. Some of its catalog and operations were merged into the still independent Restless Records in 1991.

Enigma&#x27;s Canadian division was closed in 1992 and was reorganized into FRE Records before shuttering in 1999, after which its back catalogs was sold to DROG Records.

The Enigma catalog is controlled by Capitol Music Group, owned by Universal Music Group which acquired Capitol&#x27;s former parent EMI and the majority of its recorded music operations in 2012. Disney Music Group&#x27;s Hollywood Records, distributed by UMG, handles the reissues of Stryper&#x27;s Enigma albums. The catalog of Devo&#x27;s albums and Enigma titles that were merged into Restless is owned by Warner Music Group, which acquired Restless&#x27;s previous parent Rykodisc in 2006, and distributed by the Alternative Distribution Alliance.

<doc id="931946" wikidata="Q62265235" url="?curid=931946" title="Enterprise Records">
<text>Enterprise Records was started in 1967 as a sub-label of Stax Records. It&#x27;s best-known recording artist during its existence was Isaac Hayes, who secured a #1 R&amp;B and pop crossover smash in 1971 with the soundtrack hit &quot;Theme from Shaft&quot;. In addition to Isaac Hayes, Big Ben Atkins, Cliff Cochran, Connie Eaton, Maynard Ferguson , Little Sonny, O.B. McClinton, Eric Mercury and David Porter also recorded for the label.

==Background==
Enterprise was a subsidiary of the Stax label. It was founded in 1967.

In May 1968, parent company Stax ended its relationship with the Atlantic label as they had merged with Gulf- Western Industries, Inc. which was the umbrella org. of Paramount Pictures. The upper management of Stax remained the same with Jim Stewart staying on as president and Al Bell staying on as vice-president. They were to work directly with Arnold D. Burk, who was the vice -president in charge of music operations for Paramount Pictures . In addition to their desire to expand the Enterprise label, they were looking to do the same with their pop -rock label, Hip Records. It appears at the time, Enterprise was regarded as a jazz-folk label.

An example of some of the success Enterprise was having can be seen in the May 16, 1970 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; where the label had three albums in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Best Selling Soul albums chart. &quot;The Isaac Hayes Movement&quot; album by Isaac Hayes was at no. 1, the &quot; Gritty, Groovy, &amp; Gettin&#x27; It&quot; album by David Porter was at no. 4, and the &quot;Hot Buttered Soul&quot; album by Isaac Hayes was at no. 10. The two Isaac Hayes LPs were also at no. 1 and no. 6 respectively in the Best Selling Jazz LP&#x27;s chart that week.

==History==
It was reported by &quot;Billboard&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s June 29, 1968, issue that Maynard Ferguson had recently joined the Enterprise record label.

Albums on the Enterprise label that were &quot;happening as per Ed Ochs&#x27; Soul Sauce column in &quot;Billboard&quot;, September 4, 1971 included &quot;Shaft&quot; by Isaac Hayes &amp; the Bar-Kays, &quot;Victim of the Joke&quot; by David Porter, &quot;Funky Rock&quot; by Eric Mercury, and &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; by Little Sonny. Also that year, the &quot;Patchouli&quot; album by Big Ben Atkins was released on Enterprise ENS-102.

It was reported by &quot;Billboard&quot; in the May 12, 1973 issue that Enterprise was in the process of signing Weldon Lane, a former Capitol artist. They had just released an album for O.B. McClinton and were rushing out a single of his. They had also purchased a master recording in Orlando of Paige O&#x27;Brien (O&#x27;Brian), which resulted in the release of her single &quot;Satisfied Woman&quot;. Local artist Dale Yard recorded a single in a session was described as done with the total &quot;Memphis country sound&quot;. The single &quot;Purple Cow&quot; bw &quot;I&#x27;ma Goin&#x27; A Courtin&#x27;&quot; which was released on Enterprise ENA-9068 was reviewed in the May 19 issue of &quot;Cash Box&quot; with the reviewer saying &quot;The lively carefree nature of the tune should find many a country fanatic whistling and stomping along with the beat. The label had also purchased some masters from the Capitol label. The first of them was a Roland Eaton recording which was re-mixed and then released. Enterprise were also about to release a single by Birmingham artist, Roger Hallmark, and an LP album by Eddie Bond. At the time the label&#x27;s director of the country operation was Jerry Seabolt.

On the week of July 3, 1973, the &quot;Live at the Sahara Tahoe&quot; by Isaac Hayes was at its second week at no. 1 on the &quot;Record World&quot; R&amp;B LP chart.

It was reported by &quot;Billboard&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s May 25, 1974, issue that Stax Records via its Enterprise subsidiary was expanding its country division. It had recently signed three artists to the label. The label&#x27;s country promoter and coordinator Merlin Littlefield said there would be more to come. With the expansion, Bill Hickman and Carol Stevenson had taken up positions in the office. For some time, Enterprise&#x27;s country division had O.B. McClinton as their only artist. The recent additions were, Connie Eaton who had been Chart Records and the Atlanta GRC label, and Cliff Cochran who would be produced by Joe Allison and Hank Cochran. Enterprise was using Larry Butler who was an independent producer in Nashville was to handle most of the production and recording. Also in the same issue, Bill Williams reported in his Nashville Scene section that when Cliff Cochran was to cut his new single for the label, his cousin-in-law, Jeannie Seely would be joining him on harmony vocals. The label also thought they were getting Jan Howard but she changed her mind and went to the Atlanta-based GRC Records label.

<doc id="931947" wikidata="Q7093595" url="?curid=931947" title="One strike, you're out">
<text>One strike, you&#x27;re out, is a colloquial term for a policy which allows tenants living in housing projects or otherwise receiving housing assistance from the federal government to be evicted if they, or any guest or visitor under their more-or-less direct control, engage in certain types of criminal activity on or, in some cases, even off the premises of said housing. This term is used because housing authorities do not have to offer a second chance. The term is apparently a back-formation of the &quot;three strikes, you&#x27;re out&quot; concept embodied in the mandatory sentencing laws for repeat criminal offenders that began to be enacted in various American states in the 1990s.

== History ==
The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 predated One Strike, You&#x27;re Out, and outlined eligibility requirements public housing authorities were to use to screen candidates. Legislation mandating the eviction of tenants whose dwelling units are the scene of criminal actions was passed by the United States Congress in 1996 and signed by President Bill Clinton. In his 1996 State of the Union Address, President Clinton laid the foundation for the One Strike policy: &quot;I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants. From now on, the rule for residents who commit drug crimes and peddle drugs should be one strike and you&#x27;re out. I challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.&quot; The provisions of the law took effect gradually and were essentially fully in place nationwide by 1998.

== Components of the policy ==
The policy was drafted by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, as a part of the Housing Opportunity Extension (“HOPE”) Act of 1996. Six months following the creation of the policy 3,847 people were evicted from various housing projects across the country. Public housing projects saw an 84% increase in the number of evictees six months prior to the signing of the law. While many types of crime are covered by the law, the vast majority of the evictions pursued under it have involved acts of physical and sexual violence and the sale and/or possession of illicit drugs.

In theory, the offending tenant is banned for life from receiving any form of federal public housing assistance, but a mechanism exists for the evictee to apply for reinstatement after three years (with no guarantee that this application or any future such application, will be granted). Individual states are also permitted to opt out of the law or modify its provisions as they see fit such as by imposing a temporary rather than a lifetime ban or limiting the ban to certain offenses.

== Challenges to the policy ==
In January 2001, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared the law to be unconstitutional in cases where the criminal wrongdoing in question was actually committed not by the tenant but by a person not legally residing in the unit, such as the tenant&#x27;s grown child or guest. &quot;Rucker v. Davis&quot; concerned a 63-year-old grandmother, Pearlie Rucker, who was evicted because a member of her family had incurred a drug conviction. The court held that the federal statute that allowed the Oakland Housing Authority to evict Rucker should not be interpreted to allow the eviction of a tenant merely because of the wrongdoing of another.

However, the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s &quot;en banc&quot; ruling was overturned in 2002 by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;HUD v. Rucker&quot;. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for a unanimous Court (with Justice Stephen Breyer having recused himself), held that &quot;the plain language of [the statute] requires leases that grant public housing authorities the discretion to terminate tenancy without regard to the tenant’s knowledge of the drug-related criminal activity.&quot;

== Criticisms ==
The law has encountered fierce opposition from African-American groups, and advocates for the poor in general. Some critics have argued that because evictions are civil proceedings and not criminal, less evidence is needed to prove a case against a tenant. Additionally, opponents have pointed out the aspect of the policy that allows housing authorities to evict tenants based on the actions of their relatives and guests.

Between 2003 and 2007, Representative Barbara Lee of California, attempted to amend One Strike You&#x27;re Out with legislation intended to address this common criticism. H.R. 1309, H.R. 173 and H.R 1429 would exempt elderly tenants and those who were not aware of such criminal activity, from being evicted or denied admissions into a housing project. All three bills died in committee.

== Other applications ==
Since the passage of the public-housing law that forms the basis for this article, the term &quot;One strike, you&#x27;re out&quot; has also acquired other popular applications, including the idea that the Roman Catholic Church should defrock priests upon the first sustained allegation of child molestation, and also to denote a proposed law in Washington that would mandate a life prison sentence for anyone convicted of any of several sexually motivated crimes against children; known as Initiative 861, it failed to gather enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in 2004.

<doc id="931949" wikidata="Q1105463" url="?curid=931949" title="Cocoon (film)">
<text>Cocoon is a 1985 American science fiction comedy drama film directed by Ron Howard and written by Tom Benedek from a story by David Saperstein. The film stars Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn, Brian Dennehy, Jack Gilford, Steve Guttenberg, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy, Gwen Verdon, Herta Ware, Tahnee Welch, and Linda Harrison, and follows a group of elderly people rejuvenated by aliens.

The film was shot in and around St. Petersburg, Florida, with locations including the St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club, Suncoast Manor Retirement Community, the Coliseum, and Snell Arcade buildings. The film earned Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Don Ameche) and Best Visual Effects, and was followed by the sequel &quot;&quot; in 1988, in which almost all of the original cast returned.

==Plot==
About 10,000 years ago, peaceful aliens from the planet Antarea set up an outpost on Earth on Atlantis. When Atlantis sank, twenty aliens were left behind, kept alive in large rock-like cocoons at the bottom of the ocean. A group of Antareans have returned to collect them. Disguising themselves as humans, they rent a house with a swimming pool and charge the water with &quot;life force&quot; to give the cocooned Antareans energy to survive the trip home. They charter a boat, the &quot;Manta III&quot;, from a local captain named Jack, who helps them retrieve the cocoons. Jack spies on Kitty, a beautiful woman from the team who chartered his boat, while she undresses in her cabin, and discovers that she is an alien. After the aliens reveal themselves to him and explain what is going on, he decides to help them.

Next door to the house the Antareans are renting is a retirement home. Three of its residents, Ben, Arthur, and Joe, often trespass to swim in the pool. They absorb some of the life force, making them feel younger and stronger. Eventually caught in the act, they are given permission to use the pool by the Antarean leader, Walter, on the condition that they do not touch the cocoons or tell anybody else about it. Rejuvenated with youthful energy, the three men let the advantages of the pool take hold as they are relieved of their ailments.

Kitty and Jack grow closer and decide to make love in the pool. Since she cannot do so in the human manner, she introduces him to the Antarean equivalent, in which she shares her life force energy with him.

The other retirement home residents become suspicious after witnessing Mary, Ben&#x27;s wife, climb a tree. Their friend Bernie accidentally reveals the secret of the pool to the other residents, who rush to the pool to swim in its waters. When Walter finds them damaging one of the cocoons, he ejects them from the property. The Antareans open the damaged cocoon, and the creature inside shares his last moments with Walter. That evening, Bernie finds his wife Rose has stopped breathing and carries her body to the pool to heal her, only to be informed by Walter that the pool no longer works due to the other residents draining the life force in the rush to make themselves young.

Walter explains that the cocoons cannot survive the trip back to Antarea, but will be able to survive on Earth. With the help of Jack, Ben, Arthur and Joe, the Antareans return the cocoons to the sea. The Antareans offer to take residents of the retirement home with them to Antarea, where they will never grow older and never die. Most of them accept the offer, but Bernie chooses to remain on Earth.

Upon leaving, Ben tells his grandson David that he and Mary are leaving for good. As the residents are leaving, David&#x27;s mother Susan finds out about their destination and drives to the retirement home, where they find the majority of the rooms vacant and contact local authorities.

While the police are searching for the residents in the dark, David notices Jack&#x27;s boat being started, with the Antareans and the retirement residents aboard. He runs toward it as fast as he can and as the &quot;Manta III&quot; pulls away from the dock, leaps across the gap, clings to its side, and is pulled aboard by Ben. The boat is chased by the Coast Guard, so with little time left, David says goodbye to Ben and Mary before jumping into the sea. The Coast Guard boats stop to pick him up, giving the others a chance to get away. A thick, mysterious fog appears suddenly, stranding the remaining Coast Guard boats and causing the &quot;Manta III&quot; to disappear from their radar, so they call off the chase.

As the Antarean ship appears overhead, Walter pays Jack for his services and for his boat. Jack embraces Kitty for the last time and they share a kiss. He then says farewell to everyone before jumping into an inflatable life raft as the &quot;Manta III&quot; rises up into the Antarean vessel. Jack watches as it disappears inside the ship and departs.

Back on land, a tearful memorial service is held on a beach for the missing residents. During the sermon, David looks toward the sky and smiles.

==Production==
Robert Zemeckis was originally hired as director, and spent a year working on it in development. He was at the time directing &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, another film for the same studio, 20th Century Fox. Fox executives previewed &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; before its release in 1984 and hated it. That, in addition to his two previous directorial efforts, &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Used Cars&quot;, both being commercial failures — though critically acclaimed — led Fox to fire Zemeckis as director of &quot;Cocoon&quot;. He was replaced with Ron Howard.

Location filming took place in St. Petersburg, Florida, between August 20 and November 1, 1984.

Wilford Brimley was only 49 when he was cast as a senior citizen, and turned 50 during filming; he was as much as 26 years younger than the actors playing the other elderly characters. In order to look the part, Brimley bleached his hair and moustache to turn them gray, and had wrinkles and liver spots drawn on his face.

==Soundtrack==

The score for &quot;Cocoon&quot; was composed and conducted by James Horner. The soundtrack was released twice, through Polydor Records in 1985 and a reprint through P.E.G. in 1997 and features eleven tracks of score and a vocal track performed by Michael Sembello. Despite the reprint, it is still considered a rarity among soundtrack collectors.

In 2013, an expanded soundtrack consisting of over 62 minutes of Horner&#x27;s score was released by the Intrada label.

==Reception==
&quot;Cocoon&quot; received mostly positive critical reception. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mr. Howard brings a real sweetness to his subject, as does the film&#x27;s fine cast of veteran stars; he has also given &quot;Cocoon&quot; the bright, expansive look of a hot-weather hit. And even when the film begins to falter, as it does in its latter sections, Mr. Howard&#x27;s touch remains reasonably steady. He does the most he can with material that, after an immensely promising opening, heads into the predictable territory of Spielberg-inspired beatific science fiction&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a fountain of youth fable, which imaginatively melds galaxy fantasy with the lives of aging mortals in a Florida retirement home [and] weaves a mesmerizing tale&quot;.

The film holds an 82% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 49 critics. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Though it may be too sentimental for some, Ron Howard&#x27;s supernatural tale of eternal youth is gentle and heartwarming, touching on poignant issues of age in the process&quot;. Metacritic gave the film a score of 65 based on 18 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film was also a box office hit, making over $76 million in North America where it became the sixth highest-grossing film of 1985.

===Accolades===
==Brimley/&quot;Cocoon&quot; line meme==
Wilford Brimley&#x27;s age during the production and release of the film has been the subject of a popular Internet meme concerning aging. Brimley, who was only 50 years old when the film was released, was relatively young to play a senior citizen. When Tom Cruise turned 50 in 2012, many juxtaposed his role in the ongoing &quot;&quot; franchise to Brimley&#x27;s role in &quot;Cocoon&quot;, noting that Cruise was continuing to headline a major action franchise at the same age Brimley played an aging senior (coincidentally, both Cruise and Brimley starred together in &quot;The Firm&quot; in 1993). This has resulted in the Brimley/&quot;Cocoon&quot; line meme, in which an actor who reaches 18,530 days of age (the exact age Brimley was when &quot;Cocoon&quot; premiered) has crossed it. A 2018 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Ian Crouch argued that the meme highlighted how perceptions of aging have changed since the release of &quot;Cocoon&quot;.

<text>Arad County was an administrative unit in the Kingdom of Hungary, the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and the Principality of Transylvania. The county was established along the Maros (Mureș) River in the 11th or the , but its first head, or &quot;ispán&quot;, was only mentioned in 1214. Its territory is now part of Romania, except a small area (the town of Elek and the surrounding villages) which is part of Hungary. The capital of the county was Arad.

== Geography ==

The medieval Arad County was situated in the lands along both banks of the Maros (Mureș) River. The existence of arable lands, pastures, vineyards and orchards in the western lowlands in the Middle Ages is well-documented. The hilly eastern regions were sparsely populated. The total territory of the medieval county was around .

In 1744, Arad County absorbed a large part of Zaránd County, including its capital Zaránd/Zărand (the remainder of Zaránd County was then reorganized, with Körösbánya/Baia de Criș as the new capital). In 1876, when the administrative structure of the Kingdom of Hungary was changed, the territory of Arad County was further modified to include the western third of the diminished Zaránd County, namely the Nagyhalmágy/Hălmagiu district (Zaránd County was disbanded altogether on that occasion).

Arad County shared borders with the Hungarian counties of Csanád, Békés, Bihar, Torda-Aranyos, Hunyad, Krassó-Szörény, Temes, and Torontál. The river Mureș formed its southern border. Crișul Alb River flowed through the county. Its area was around 1910.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The Hungarians dominated the region of the Maros in the middle of the , according to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Archaeological finds also shows that Hungarians settled in the plains along the river after their arrival in the Carpathian Basin at the end of the . Place names of Slavic origin, including Lipova (Lippa) and Zăbrani (Temeshidegkút), evidence the presence of Slavic speaking communities, especially in the region where the river, coming from the mountains, reached the lowlands.

A powerful chieftain, Ajtony, ruled the territory along the rivers Danube, Maros and Tisza in the early . The Maros formed the northern border of Ajtony&#x27;s realm, according to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, but the longer version of the &quot;Legend of Saint Gerard&quot; wrote that he controlled the lands as far as the Körös River. Ajtony was killed in a battle against the army of Stephen I of Hungary, which was under the command of Csanád. According to a scholarly theory, first proposed by historian György Györffy, Stephen I established Arad County after Ajtony&#x27;s fall. On the other hand, historian Gyula Kristó writes that Ajtony&#x27;s whole realm was transformed into the large Csanád County during Stephen I&#x27;s reign; Arad County only developed into a separate administrative unit in the second half of the or in the .

=== Middle Ages ===


The remains of an 11th-century stronghold, made of earth and timber, were found at Arad. At an assembly held in Arad in 1131, the wife of King Béla the Blind, Helena of Rascia, ordered the massacre of 68 Hungarian lords. Arad Castle and the estates attached to it were first documented in a royal charter, issued in 1177. The first known &quot;ispán&quot;, or head, of Arad County, Paul Csanád, was mentioned in a royal diploma, dated to 1214, but its authenticity is suspect. The earliest authentic document that referred to an &quot;ispán&quot; of Arad was issued in 1240. The western regions of the county were included in the Deanery of Arad of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Csanád; the Archdean of Arad was first mentioned in 1288.

The earliest documents suggest that the kings owned most lands in the plains along the Maros. However, the distribution of royal domains started at the end of the . For instance, Ladislaus I of Hungary and his brother, Lampert, granted five villages to the Titel Chapter before 1095 and Béla the Blind established the Arad Chapter in the 1130s. The Hodos clan was the only local noble kindred in the county; they were the patrons of the Hodoș-Bodrog Monastery. Members of the Csanád, Csák and Dorozsma clans received estates in Arad County in the early .

The effects of the Mongol invasion of Hungary cannot exactly be determined, but at least four monasteries disappeared. Solymos Castle (in present-day Șoimoș in Lipova), the first fortress built by a nobleman in the county, was erected after the withdrawal of the Mongols. Ecclesiastic institutions, prelates and lay lordsincluding the bishop of Csanád, the Arad Chapter and the Garais, Lackfis and Telegdisheld most former royal estates in the first half of the . The existence of four elected &quot;judges of the nobles&quot; was first documented in 1311, proving that Arad County had transformed into a &quot;noble county&quot;, an institution of the local noblemen&#x27;s self-government.

Lippa (present-day Lipova) became the most prosperous settlement in the early : the tax payable by the local priest to the Holy See between 1333 and 1335 (266 dinars) was almost ten times higher than the average tax collected in other parishes. The Slavs of the district of Lipova were converted into Catholicism in the middle of the century, according to John of Küküllő&#x27;s contemporaneous chronicle. The earliest Romanian place name in the county&quot;Caprewar&quot; (now Căprioara)was recorded in a list of the estates of the Telegdis which was completed in 1337.

=== Modern Times ===

In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon assigned most of the territory of Arad county to Romania, except for a small area south of Békéscsaba, which became part of the newly formed Hungarian county of Csanád-Arad-Torontál in 1923. At the end of World War II, the Hungarian part of Arad county was merged into the recreated Csanád county, but in 1950 that county was split and its territory became part of Békés County.

The rest of the county is now part of the Arad County in Romania. This county also contains parts of the former counties Temes and Krassó-Szörény.

<text>Trenitalia [[Società per azioni|SpA]] is the primary train operator of Italy. A subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, itself partly owned by the Italian government, the company is owned publicly and partly private from a private investors group. It was established in 2000 following a European Union directive on the deregulation of rail transport.

In a comparative study by the European umbrella organization Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E), Trenitalia 2024 achieved the best result of 27 companies. The criteria were reliability, booking, amenities on board and taking bikes on medium and long-distance connections.

==History==

The Italian government formed Trenitalia to comply with European Union regulations. The European Commission&#x27;s First Railway Directive from 1991 (91/440/EC) required separation of accounting between entities which manage the rail infrastructure and entities which provide the actual rail transportation. On 1 June 2000, therefore, Italy created Trenitalia as the primary rail transportation company and on 1 July 2001 established Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) as the company overseeing the rail network. However, the separation was only formal since both are subsidiaries of the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane holding and are owned wholly by the government. Trenitalia operated freight rail services under the Trenitalia Cargo brand until 2017, when Mercitalia took over state-owned freight rail and logistics operations.

As of July 2014, Adria Ferries has a partnership with Trenitalia wherein tickets can be booked at any train station for onward journey to Durrës, at a steeply discounted price with respect to both tickets separately purchased. This is for connections either in Ancona or in Trieste, and continues the historical link between the Via Appia Traiana and the Via Egnatia.

==Passenger transport==
Trenitalia offers national rail transport in Italy and international connections to Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland. The company operates both regional and long-distance trains.

===Regional trains===
Regional trains travel within an Italian region or between neighbouring Italian regions, and are subsidized by local government at the regional level by &quot;Contratto di servizio&quot;. Regional trains stop at more stations than other long-distance trains, and some stop at all stations. &quot;Regionale veloce&quot; (fast regional train) are trains stopping at about half of the stations.

There are no reservations for regional trains, and for this reason, there is no price advantage to acquiring regional tickets in advance online. Once bought, tickets for regional trains have to be validated at the station before departure. &quot;Validation&quot; in this case means placing a date/time stamp on the ticket by inserting it into a (usually) green and white machine either in the station or along the track. This is because regional tickets are not for a particular date or time but are valid for a period (two months for tickets bought before 1 August 2016). The date/time stamp is to show that the ticket cannot be reused. From 1 August 2016, tickets are valid for the 24 hours chosen by online buyers; the date of use can be changed until the previous 24 hours of the later date. The date of use can be anticipated until the 24 hours following this adjusting operation. The omission about the period of use at paper shops will involve a one-way daily ticket issue. This change aims to hinder fare evasion.

There are no discount schemes available for non-residents of Italy on regional trains.

===Long-distance trains and high-speed trains===

Trenitalia&#x27;s long-distance trains are mainly of two types, the high-speed &quot;Frecce&quot; (&quot;Arrows&quot;) trainsets and the semi-fast classic &quot;InterCity&quot; trains with the following brands being used as of 2024:

*Frecciarossa - long distance high-speed services up to 300 km/h
*Frecciargento - long distance high-speed services up to 250 km/h
*Frecciabianca - long distance services up to 200 km/h
*InterCity - long distance services up to 200 km/h using regular coaches
*InterCity Notte - long distance night trains

High-speed rail (managed by RFI) service in Italy commenced in 2008 with about of new track on the Turin-Milan-Bologna-Rome-Naples-Salerno route that allow trains to reach speeds over , although current maximum commercial speed is . There are currently four generations of ElettroTreno in service on the network. Trenitalia ordered 50 high-speed trainsets in 2010. The new trains are the ETR 1000 series. They are long, non-articulated trains, with distributed traction, and capable of up to operation, although current service plans are limited to . Mauro Moretti, at the time chief executive of FS group, said FS was considering long-distance international services to France, Germany, or even Spain and the United Kingdom. The trains entered service on the Italian high-speed network in 2015.

=== International passenger services ===
====Current====
*Iryo, a high-speed operator in Spain owned by Trenitalia and Air Nostrum, as part of the ILSA consortium. ILSA was selected by ADIF, the company that runs Spanish rail infrastructure, as the first private operator to be granted access to the Spanish rail market. The Trenitalia consortium will run high-speed services on the Madrid-Barcelona, Madrid-Valencia/Alicante and Madrid-Malaga/Seville lines, branded as IRYO. Services will start running in January 2022. The service contract will have a duration of 10 years. The ILSA consortium will offer 32 daily links with a fleet of 23 trains.

*TILO: 50% owned by Trenord (formerly these shares were owned by Trenitalia), 50% owned by the Swiss Federal Railways. The company runs the regional services between Italy and Switzerland. The staff all change at the border and are either FS Trenitalia or SBB CFF FFS. Trenitalia operates all fast trains to/from Switzerland in the Italian portion of the route.

*Trenitalia France was created in October 2021 by repurposing the former Thello subsidiary. In December 2021, Trenitalia France launched the Milan–Paris Frecciarossa, an open-access service between Paris and Milan, using Frecciarossa 1000 trains. Two trains a day run from Gare de Lyon and Milano Centrale in each direction with intermediate stops at Lyon Part-Dieu, Chambéry-Challes-les-Eaux and Modane in France and Torino Porta Susa in Italy.

====Former====
*Artésia was a company jointly owned by Trenitalia and SNCF, operating trains between France and Italy. It ceased operating in November 2011 after SNCF purchased a stake in Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori.

*Thello was a private railway service formed as a joint venture with Transdev. In September 2016, Trenitalia bought out Transdev&#x27;s 33% shareholding. It operated night trains between Paris Gare de Lyon and Venezia Santa Lucia railway station and daytime trains between Milan and Marseille via Genoa and Nice. In 2020, Thello overnight services between Paris and Venice were suspended in March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, with the daytime train cut back to run between Nice and Milan. In June 2021, all services were withdrawn, with Trenitalia announcing a focus on high-speed services between the two countries following the pandemic. The withdrawal was criticised, given the reduction in services between Nice and Milan. Thello was renamed Trenitalia France in October 2021.

===Operations in the United Kingdom===
In January 2017, Trenitalia won a bid from the Department for Transport (DfT) to run train operating company c2c from National Express which has a contract to operate the Essex Thameside franchise until November 2029. In the same month it took a 30% stake in a joint venture with FirstGroup, named First Trenitalia, that was later shortlisted to bid for the East Midlands Railway and West Coast Partnership franchises. It was also shortlisted to bid for the South Eastern franchise in its own right.

In August 2017, Trenitalia withdrew from the South Eastern contest, citing a desire to concentrate its resources on its bid for the West Coast Partnership. Likewise in April 2018, along with FirstGroup, it withdrew from the East Midlands contest citing the same reason.

In August 2019, the First Trenitalia consortium was awarded the West Coast Partnership contract. Avanti West Coast ran its first train between London and Manchester on 8 December.

==Tickets==
Tickets can be bought online, in the stations or from approximately 4,000 travel agencies including those outside Italy. It is common for people to buy tickets from the official website after looking up schedules.

Since long-distance trains, unlike regional trains, usually require a reservation, it is advantageous to buy tickets in advance. This also gives buyers access to a variety of discount schemes offered by Trenitalia. All &quot;premium&quot; long-distance trains generally share the same discount schemes, even though their fares may differ. Unlike mini fares, which existed before 2012 and required two days of notice, all tickets may be purchased at the last minute if they are still available. All large rail stations have staffed ticket windows and self-service ticket machines for this purpose. Such machines, which either say &quot;Trenitalia&quot; or &quot;Rete Regionale&quot; (&quot;regional network&quot;), differ in the types of payment accepted.

==Criticism==
In early 2012, Trenitalia released a web advertisement to promote its change from two classes of train compartments into four classes. Passengers travelling by the fourth class were not permitted to use the on-board cafeteria or enter the carriages reserved for the other three classes. This change alone reportedly caused controversy, but more followed with the release of the accompanying web advertisement. The web advertisement showed only white people seated in the upper three classes, as well as a black family in the fourth. Italian online media observed this and branded the advertisement as &quot;grotesque&quot;. Other complaints of racial discrimination followed in UK newspapers, social media and online. Trenitalia withdrew the web commercial and quickly substituted it following the allegations of racism. Since 13 January 2012 the cafeteria is accessible also for passengers of lower classes.

<text>Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) is the Italian railway infrastructure manager, subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (FS), a state-owned holding company. RFI is the owner of Italy&#x27;s railway network, it provides signalling, maintenance and other services for the railway network. It also operates train ferries between the Italian Peninsula and Sicily.

RFI&#x27;s origins can be traced back to a series of railway sector reforms enacted by the Italian government during the late 1980s and 1990s. The agency was founded on 1 July 2001 in accordance with a European directive on rail transport that mandated the separation of the infrastructure operator and the service operators. Prior to RFI&#x27;s creation, the Italian rail network was managed directly by FS. The agency has been periodically accused of failure to be impartial, including allegations of favouring sibling company Trenitalia over independent operations. The company has been fined in the past for anti-trust breaches. Since its creation, revenue abstraction from access charges have steadily increased, primarily due to the expansion of Italy&#x27;s high-speed rail network, even as access charges have been decreased.

==History==
Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, the Italian government directed major restructurion of Italy&#x27;s railways. During 1992, Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) had been converted to a joint-stock company, albeit remaining fully state-owned. Six years later, in order to comply with recently-issued railway legislation by the European Union, the Italian government planned the company&#x27;s vertical separation between its infrastructure and services; while management of passenger service was to be handled by Trenitalia, the management of the lines themselves and general infrastructure lines was to be assigned to the newly created infrastructure management agency RFI. Since its creation, RFI has been a subsidiary of FS, and thus is a 100 percent state-owned entity with limited independence. RFI&#x27;s independence and neutrality have occasionally been publicly called into question.

During the 2000s and 2010s, RFI has reported a substantial growth in revenue derived from operators for access to the Italian high-speed rail network. This has been due to a greater rate of utilisation having been achieved, which can be in turn partially attributed to the arrival of private operators, such as Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori (NTV), upon the Italian rail network. Between 2009 and 2014, the revenue associated with access charges rose from €903.1 million to €1,051.2 million in spite of a 15 percent price drop in these charges as a result of Ministerial Decree n.330 being issued in 10 September 2013.

Following the 2009 Viareggio train derailment, which caused the death of 32 people, a criminal proceeding was initiated. As a result of the investigation, former RFI CEOs Mauro Moretti and Michele Mario Elia were convicted for their roles in causing the accident. The Supreme Court later annulled the sentence of the appeal judge, referring the positions of the CEOs to the Florence Court of Appeal for a new judgment. The Supreme Court also pronounced a definitive sentence of acquittal of RFI from the accused responsibility.

As a natural result of its dominant position in the market, RFI&#x27;s policies and actions are able to play a prominent role in determining the level of fair access to Italy&#x27;s railway infrastructure, particularly to the various terminals, depots, maintenance facilities and retail areas under its ownership. In exchange for their use, all operators are required to pay corresponding charges to RFI. During 2016, railway author Christian Desmaris observed that it was somewhat problematic for authorities to ensure that RFI is providing fair access to retail facilities, information and ticketing systems and other computer-based systems. 

Due to the relatively large investments required to enter the market, an excessive charging scheme could deter potential new entrants to challenge incumbent operators. Italy&#x27;s antitrust agency has published numerous reports pertaining to railway infrastructure issues, and performed in-depth investigations into both RFI and Trenitalia for potential anti-competitive actions, the authority typically found no evidence of any such abuses of position. However, during August 2018, RFI was fined €620,000 for anti-competitive practices that favoured Trenitalia over the privately-operated NTV.

During the 2010s, RFI, in conjunction with the development of ETR 1000 by AnsaldoBreda and Bombardier Transportation, was at one point working on the necessary infrastructure changes to allow trains to reach up to in regular operation. However, on 28 May 2018, the Ministry for Infrastructures and Transportation and the National Association for Railway Safety decided not to run the 385 km/h tests required to allow commercial operation at 350 km/h, thus limiting the maximum commercial speed on the existing Italian high-speed lines to 300 km/h and cancelling the project.

<text>The Hunters of the Alps () were a military corps created by Giuseppe Garibaldi in Cuneo on 20 February 1859 to help the regular Sardinian army to free the northern part of Italy in the Second Italian War of Independence.

As their name suggests, the corps&#x27; five regiments of volunteers operated in the Alps. Among their victories in the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, were those over the Austrians in the Battle of Varese and the Battle of San Fermo.

They also saw action during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866, fighting on the Prussian side against the Austrians. On this occasion, the 40,000 volunteers showed their value by achieving a decisive victory at the Battle of Bezzecca (21 July 1866), and thus nearly reaching the town of Trento. 

The 22nd Infantry Division &quot;Cacciatori delle Alpi&quot; of World War II was named after the &quot;Hunters of the Alps&quot; unit.

<doc id="931962" wikidata="Q827218" url="?curid=931962" title="Bersaglieri">
<text>The Bersaglieri, singular Bersagliere, (, &quot;sharpshooter&quot;) are a troop of marksmen in the Italian Army&#x27;s infantry corps. They were originally created by General Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora on 18 June 1836 to serve in the Royal Sardinian Army, which later became the Royal Italian Army. They can be recognized by their distinctive wide-brimmed hats decorated with black western capercaillie feathers, which is worn with the dress uniform. The feathers are also applied to their combat helmets.

==Description==
The Bersaglieri Corps were a high-mobility light infantry at their inception in 1836, with their specific situation evolving with changes in warfare. In the nineteenth century, Bersaglieri acted as skirmishers or shock troops, moving from place to place by running. An elaborate system of bugle calls allowed their units to be deployed and commanded quickly, singly or in combination. The tradition of running continues today in parades and during barracks duty. In World War I, some Bersaglieri served as bicycle troops, better to execute their mission of maneuver warfare. During the Cold War, the Bersaglieri were exclusively employed as mechanized infantry.

Bersaglieri are well-known for their extraordinary performances in parades and military tattoos, always running instead of marching, with hundreds of black capercaillie feathers flowing from their wide-brimmed black hats. These feathers are also worn on Bersaglieri combat helmets. They once served a military purpose, acting as camouflage and as a sunshade for the marksman&#x27;s shooting eye. Today, they are a badge of honour, attracting new recruits and fostering esprit among their wearers.

==Origins and history==
The relatively poor Kingdom of Sardinia could not afford large numbers of cavalry, so a quick-moving infantry corps of marksmen were needed. These troops were trained to high physical and marksmanship standards. Like the French chasseurs à pied, a level of independence and initiative was encouraged so that they could operate in looser formations, in which direct command and control was not required. They fired individually and carried 60 rounds instead of the standard 40 rounds of traditional line infantry. The first uniform was black with brimmed hats, called &quot;vaira&quot;. These were intended to defend the head from sabre blows.

The first public appearance of the Bersaglieri was on the occasion of a military parade on 1 July 1836. The First Company marched through Turin with the rapid, high-stepping gait (180 paces/minute) still used by the Bersaglieri in World War II and later. The modern Bersaglieri still run both on parade and even during barracks duty – on penalty of punishment if they do not. The new corps impressed King Charles Albert, who immediately had them integrated as part of the Piedmontese regular army. The corps grew rapidly and by 1852 there were already 10 battalions, each with four companies.

Throughout the nineteenth century the Bersaglieri filled the role of skirmishers, screening the slow-moving line and column formations, but acting as special shock troops if required. They were originally intended to serve as mountain troops, as well; the climber Jean-Antoine Carrel was a Bersagliere. When the Alpini Corps were created in 1872 a strong rivalry arose between the two elite corps.

==Unified Italy==

During the First War of Italian Independence (1848–1849) the Bersaglieri distinguished themselves by storming the bridge at Goito in an episode known to later historiography as the Battle of Goito Bridge (&quot;la Battaglia del Ponte di Goito&quot;). In 1855 the Bersaglieri provided five battalions for the Sardinian expeditionary corps in the Crimean War, where they were involved in the Siege of Sevastopol and the Battle of the Chernaya. Most of the casualties were suffered due to a cholera epidemic. Their bravery at the Cernaia was widely recognized and played a key role in gaining Piedmont-Sardinia a seat in the negotiations at the war&#x27;s end. For their effort in the Crimea, the Bersaglieri were rewarded a red fez with a blue tassel, in honour from the French zouaves troops, with whom they served, as they watched the Bersaglieri&#x27;s bravery in the battle.

When the &quot;Armata Sarda&quot; became the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (Royal Italian Army) in 1860, the existing 36 battalions were used to create six Bersaglieri regiments, which had administrative and disciplinary duties. The regiments were assigned to the army corps&#x27;, with the regiment&#x27;s battalions assigned to the divisions in the corps as reconnaissance units.

* 1st Bersaglieri Regiment under I Army Corps with the I, IX, XIII, XIX, XXI and XXVII battalions
* 2nd Bersaglieri Regiment under II Army Corps with the II, IV, X, XV, XVII and XVIII battalions
* 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment under III Army Corps with the III, V, VIII, XX, XXIII and XXV battalions
* 4th Bersaglieri Regiment under IV Army Corps with the VI, VII, XI, XII, XXXV and XXXVI battalions
* 5th Bersaglieri Regiment under V Army Corps with the XIV, XVI, XXII, XXIV, XXVI and XXXIV battalions
* 6th Bersaglieri Regiment under VI Army Corps with the XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI, XXXII and XXXIII battalions

The most famous action of the Bersaglieri occurred on 20 September 1870, when the XII Bersaglieri Battalion stormed Rome through a breach created by Italian artillery in the Aurelian Walls near Porta Pia leading to the capture of Rome and end of the temporal power of the Pope, thus completing the unification of Italy. A monument was erected in 1932 in front of Porta Pia to commemorate the event at the same time as the National Museum of the Bersaglieri corps was moved to Porta Pia, where it resides still today.

In 1871, the Bersaglieri corps added another four battalions and the regiments were increased from six to 10 and given also operational command of the battalions. In 1883 a further two regiments were added for a total of 12 Bersaglieri regiments, one for each army corps with three battalions per regiment. Therefore, the four battalions raised in 1871 were disbanded.

* 1st Bersaglieri Regiment under I Army Corps with the I, VII and IX battalions
* 2nd Bersaglieri Regiment under II Army Corps with the II, IV, and XVII battalions
* 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment under III Army Corps with the XVIII, XX, and XXV battalions
* 4th Bersaglieri Regiment under IV Army Corps with the XXVI, XXIX and XXXI battalions
* 5th Bersaglieri Regiment under V Army Corps with the XIV, XXII and XXIV battalions
* 6th Bersaglieri Regiment under VI Army Corps with the VI, XIII and XIX battalions
* 7th Bersaglieri Regiment under VII Army Corps with the VIII, X and XI battalions
* 8th Bersaglieri Regiment under VIII Army Corps with the III, V and XII battalions
* 9th Bersaglieri Regiment under IX Army Corps with the XXVIII, XXX and XXXII battalions
* 10th Bersaglieri Regiment under X Army Corps with the XVI, XXXIV and XXXV battalions
* 11th Bersaglieri Regiment under XI Army Corps with the XV, XXVII and XXXIII battalions
* 12th Bersaglieri Regiment under XII Army Corps with the XXI, XXIII and XXXVI battalions

==World War I==
During World War I, the 12 existing Bersaglieri regiments were augmented by nine newly raised regiments and fought with distinction on the Italian Front. Of the 210,000 members of Bersaglieri regiments, 32,000 were killed and 50,000 wounded during the war. Italy&#x27;s last surviving World War I veteran, Delfino Borroni, was a member of the 6th Bersaglieri Regiment from Bologna. Another member who served as Bersagliere on the front (and was wounded) was Benito Mussolini.

A contingent of Bersaglieri drawn from the autonomous battalions of the 1st Bersaglieri Regiment was sent to participate in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1917, where they were attached to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force commanded by General Edmund Allenby. Their &quot;mainly political&quot; role was to assert &quot;hereditary ecclesiastical prerogatives in connection with the Christian churches at Jerusalem and Bethlehem.&quot;

=== Peacetime regiments ===
At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 the Bersaglieri corps consisted of 12 regiments each organized into a regimental HQ, three battalions on foot, and one cyclist&#x27;s battalion. Each regiment also contained a machine gun section with two machine guns. The battalions on foot consisted of three companies of 250 men each, while the cyclist battalions consisted of three companies of 150 men each. Additionally, each cyclist&#x27;s battalion had its own machine gun section with two machine guns. Between the outbreak of the war and the Italian declaration of war on 23 May 1915 the Italian army was forced to send the 1st Bersaglieri Regiment and five battalions from other Bersaglieri regiments to Libya as the local population fiercely resisted the Italian occupation. On 29 December 1914 the army sent the 10th Bersaglieri Regiment to Albania, which was in turmoil after its freshly installed ruler William, Prince of Albania had fled the country in September 1914. Already since 4 May 1912 two battalions of the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment were in Rhodes to garrison the newly conquered Italian Islands of the Aegean.

With war imminent the army began to raise new Bersaglieri battalions to replace the battalions deployed overseas and on 8 April 1915, the 10th bis Bersaglieri Regiment was formed to replace the 10th deployed in Albania. Starting in January 1915 additional battalions were raised starting, which remained autonomous and were not integrated into an existing regiment. When hostilities commended the Bersaglieri consisted of:
* 13 regiments (one in Libya, one in Albania, eleven in Italy)
* 55 battalions on foot (41 grouped in 13 regiments (two deployed to Rhodes); 14 autonomous battalions, of which seven in Libya and seven at the Italian Front)
* 12 cyclist battalions

On 10 January 1916 the High Command ordered to increase all Bersaglieri battalions on foot by one company to four companies, with the battalions deployed to Libya being exempt, retaining three. Later that spring the Bersaglieri companies of the battalions on foot were reduced from 250 to 225 men, but in turn each battalion received its own machine gun section with two machine guns, a submachine-gun section with two Villar Perosa submachine guns, and a Sapper unit with 88 men. On 3 March 1916 the regimental command of the 1st Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded and its battalions became autonomous.

At the end of 1916 the Bersaglieri fielded:
* 15 regiments (one in Albania, 14 in Italy)
* 48 battalions on foot (45 grouped in 15 regiments and three autonomous battalions). Each of these battalions consisted of four companies of 225 men each, a sapper unit, a machine-gun section, and two submachine-gun sections
* 15 autonomous battalions on foot (two deployed to Rhodes, thirteen in Libya). Each of these battalions consisted of three companies of 250 men each and a machine-gun section
* 12 cyclist battalions, each with three companies of 150 men and a machine-gun section

Early in 1917 each battalion in Italy received a second submachine-gun section and in May the battalions were thoroughly reorganized: the machine gun sections of each battalion were increased to a machine gun company with six machine guns, while the battalion&#x27;s 4th companies were grouped in independent &quot;marching&quot; battalions (&quot;Battaglione di Marcia&quot;), which acted as personnel reserve for the armies deployed to the front.

After the defeat at Caporetto the Italian army was forced to retreat from the Isonzo river to the Piave river. During the retreat four Bersaglieri regiments and three autonomous battalions were so badly mauled that they had to be disbanded: besides the wartime regiments 15 and 21, also the peacetime regiments 4 and 9 were disbanded. Thus at the end of 1917 the Bersaglieri corps consisted of:

* 16 regiments (one in Albania, 15 in Italy)
* 48 battalions on foot (grouped in 16 regiments). Each of these battalions consisted of three companies of 225 men each, a machine gun company, a sapper unit, and two submachine-gun sections.
* 15 autonomous battalions on foot (two deployed to Rhodes, ten in Libya). Each of these battalions consisted of three companies of 250 men each and a machine-gun section
* 12 cyclist battalions, each with three companies of 150 men and a machine-gun section

After the Battle of Caporetto the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army Luigi Cadorna was finally dismissed and replaced by Armando Diaz. Diaz reorganized the army and ordered the Bersaglieri battalions to be reorganized: the companies on foot were reduced to 150 men in three platoons – two of infantry and one of sappers and combat support troops. At the same, the machine-gun companies were increased to eight machine guns, and the submachine-gun sections increased to three and attached to the companies. Each battalion also received a Stokes mortar section, while each regiment received a flamethrower section and a &quot;reparto cannoncini d&#x27;accompagnamento&quot; (loosely translated: small accompaniment cannons unit), with Italian copies of the Austrian 3.7cm Infantry Gun M.15.
Additionally the command of the 16th Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded and its battalions became autonomous, six of the autonomous battalions deployed to Libya were ordered to return and reorganized as the other battalions on the Italian front. The cyclist battalions were also reorganized (see the &quot;Cyclist Battalions&quot; section here below).

At the onset of the last offensive of the war the Bersaglieri was organized on the following structure:

* 15 regiments (one in Albania, 14 in Italy)
* 45 battalions on foot (grouped in 15 regiments). Each of these battalions consisted of three companies of 150 men each, a machine gun company, three submachine-gun sections, and a Stokes mortar section
* 12 autonomous battalions on foot (two deployed to Rhodes, four in Libya, and six battalions assigned to the two divisions of the Assault Army Corps. The overseas battalions consisted of three companies of 250 men each and a machine gun section, while the six battalions of the Assault Army Corps were organized as the regimental battalions
* 8 cyclist battalions, each with three companies of 150 men and a machine gun section (six in two groups and attached to cavalry divisions, and two assigned to the Assault Army Corps)

=== Regiments raised during the war ===
At the outbreak of the war the army fielded 13 Bersaglieri regiments: the twelve peacetime regiments and the 10th bis Bersaglieri Regiment, which had been raised with new battalions on 8 April 1915 to replace the 10th Bersaglieri Regiment sent to Vlorë in Albania on 29 December 1914. During 1915 two more regiments were raised; the 1st bis Bersaglieri Regiment with three autonomous battalions and then 13th Bersaglieri Regiment with three new battalions:

* 8 April 1915: 10th bis Bersaglieri Regiment
* 8–25 June 1915: 13th Provisional Bersaglieri Regiment. The regiment was formed from new battalions and meant to replace the 1st Bersaglieri Regiment deployed to Libya, but it became never operational, and upon reaching the front the regiment was disbanded and its battalions became autonomous.
* 24 September 1915: 1st bis Bersaglieri Regiment, formed from the three autonomous of the short-lived 13th Provisional Bersaglieri Regiment
* 22 November 1915: 13th Bersaglieri Regiment

On 5 January 1916 the 1st bis Bersaglieri Regiment changed its name and became the 15th Bersaglieri Regiment, while on the same date the 10th bis Bersaglieri Regiment changed its name and became 16th Bersaglieri Regiment. During 1916 only one new regiment was raised: the 14th Bersaglieri Regiment on 11 March with two newly formed and one autonomous battalion.

In 1917 the army raised five new Bersaglieri regiments: the 17th and 18th regiments with newly raised battalions, the 19th regiment with three autonomous battalions, and the 20th and 21st regiments with reserve battalions.

* 31 Jan. 1917: 18th Bersaglieri Regiment
* 6 Feb. 1917: 17th Bersaglieri Regiment
* 15 Feb. 1917: 19th Bersaglieri Regiment
* 1 April 1917: 20th Bersaglieri Regiment
* 27 April 1917: 21st Bersaglieri Regiment

Due to the defeat at the Battle of Caporetto the army was forced to disbanded the 15th and the 21st Bersaglieri regiments with their battalions in November 1917. In 1918 the command of the 16th Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded and its three battalions became autonomous.

After the war four of the regiments raised for the conflict were disbanded (13th, 14th, 17th, 18th), while the 19th Bersaglieri Regiment was renamed 4th Bersaglieri Regiment, and the 20th Bersaglieri Regiment was renamed 9th Bersaglieri Regiment. Of the nine regiments raised during the war none, except for 18th Bersaglieri Regiment, was ever activated again. The 18th was active again from 1 April 1935 until 31 December 1936, from 1 February 1942 until 8 September 1943, and for the last time from 10 September 1993 until 1 January 2005.

=== Cyclist Battalions ===

The twelve cyclist battalions of the peacetime regiments had been raised in 1910. Each consisted of three companies of 150 men, and a machine gun section with two machine guns. For the duration of the war the cyclists battalions operated independently from their regiments and were assigned as needed to higher commands. On various occasions Bersaglieri Cyclist Battalion Groups were formed, but only after the Battle of Caporetto forced the Italian army to retreat from the Isonzo front, during which the cyclist battalions served as rearguard, did the army institute permanent cyclist groups. These four groups were officially instituted on 15 January 1918 and each fielded three cyclist battalions and formed initially the mobile reserve of the Third Army on the lower Piave river:

* 1st Group: IV, V, XII cyclist battalions
* 2nd Group: II, X, XI cyclist battalions
* 3rd Group: I, VII, VIII cyclist battalions
* 4th Group: III, VI, IX cyclist battalions

In April and May 1918 the 1st and 2nd Group were assigned to the 1st, respectively the 7th Army to defend the Western, respectively the Eastern shore of Lake Garda from possible Austro-Hungarian amphibious landings. By June all four groups had returned to the 3rd Army and were assigned to the army&#x27;s corps as mobile reserve (1st Group to XI Corps, 2nd Group to XXVIII Corps, 3rd Group as army reserve, 4th Group to XXIII Corps).

On 24 June 1918 the 2nd and 4th group and the II, VI, IX, and X battalions were disbanded and with their troops the Cyclists Assault Battalion was formed. This battalion was assigned to the Assault Army Corps (&quot;Corpo d&#x27;Armata d&#x27;Assalto&quot;), which consisted of Bersaglieri and Arditi troops. The surviving III and XI cyclist battalions were assigned to 1st, respectively the 2nd Assault Division of the same carmy corps. The two remaining groups, the 1st and 3rd, left the 3rd Army on 16 October 1918 and were assigned for the last offensive of the war to the 1st, respectively 4th Cavalry division.

=== Autonomous Battalions ===
During World War I the Bersaglieri regiments raised a number of battalions, which were not attached to a regiment and designated as &quot;autonomous battalions&quot;. At the same time seven battalions of pre-war regiments, which were deployed to the Italian colonies, became autonomous and were replaced in their regiments by newly raised battalions. The 1st Bersaglieri Regiment was deployed to Italian Libya and its three battalions became autonomous in February 1916 when the regimental command returned to the mainland. Of the autonomous battalions raised during the war only the LII and LV battalions remaining autonomous and active for the entire duration of the conflict.

During the war a number of battalions of existing regiments became autonomous either for geographic reasons (battalion deployed to the colonies) or organizational reasons (regimental command disbanded). The following table gives an overview of these battalions:

=== Machine Gunner Companies ===
At the outbreak of the war each Royal Italian Army infantry and Bersaglieri battalion fielded one machine gun section with two Maxim 1911 machine guns, which were carried by horses. This proved quickly to be inadequate and in spring 1916 the army began to raise dedicated machine gunner companies (&quot;Compagnia Mitraglieri&quot;). These companies were attached to brigades, divisions and army corps, which deployed them with tactical units (regiments, battalions, companies) as needed. 2,277 Machine Gunner companies were raised and numbered continuously. The Bersaglieri depots raised 31 companies equipped with six St. Étienne Mle 1907 machine guns each, and the regimental depot of the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment in Brescia raised 84 companies equipped with six Fiat–Revelli Modello 1914 machine guns each.

=== Special Bersaglieri Division ===
At the outbreak of war seven Bersaglieri regiments were assigned to divisions or army corps, while four Bersaglieri regiments formed on 20 May 1915 the Special Bersaglieri Division (&quot;Divisione Speciale Bersaglieri&quot;). The four regiments were joined by IV Mountain Artillery Group (&quot;Mondovì&quot;) of the 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment and minor support units. On 11 February 1916 the four regiments were grouped together in two brigades: the I Bersaglieri Brigade consisted of the 6th and 12th Bersaglieri regiments, while the II Bersaglieri Brigade consisted of the 9th and 11th Bersaglieri regiments. After not even a year of existence the division was transformed on 5 March 1916 into a standard infantry division, with the infantry Brigade &quot;Piemonte&quot; and Brigade &quot;Aosta&quot; replacing the Bersaglieri brigades, which afterwards were attached, like other Bersaglieri units, to divisions and army corps as needed.

=== Bersaglieri Brigades ===
After the Special Bersaglieri Division had been disbanded the two Bersaglieri brigades were attached to higher commands as needed. On 6 November 1916, the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment replaced the 9th Bersaglieri Regiment in the II Bersaglieri Brigade, but there were no further changes to the brigades during that year.

In 1917 the army decided to activate a further three Bersaglieri brigades of two regiments each, bringing the Bersaglieri closer in line with the regular infantry, all of whose regiments were grouped together in brigades composed of a headquarters and two infantry regiments. During the year the III, IV, and V Bersaglieri brigades were raised, with respectively the 17th and 18th, 14th and 20th, and 4th and 21st regiments belonging to their parent brigades. However the defeat in the Battle of Caporetto led to the destruction of the V Bersaglieri Brigade, which, together with the 21st Bersaglieri Regiment, was annihilated during the retreat from the Isonzo river to the Piave river.

In 1918 the army raised the V Bersaglieri Brigade again and also activated the VI and VII Bersaglieri brigades. The VI consisted of the 8th and 13th, respectively the 2nd and 3rd Bersaglieri regiments belonged to the VII Brigade. With this, all Bersaglieri regiments in Italy were now assigned to one of the seven Bersaglieri brigades.

=== Assault Divisions ===
At the end of 1915 each infantry regiment the Italian Army began to create Arditi platoons modeled after the German Stormtroopers. These units remained a regimental asset until 1917 when the 2nd Army on its own initiative an Arditi school in Sdricca di Manzano. The first unit raised from volunteers was officially activated with a live-fire exercise in front of King Victor Emmanuel III on 29 July 1917. Named I Assault Battalion (&quot;I Reparto d&#x27;Assalto&quot;) the successful exercise led to the creation of a second battalion, with both units having their baptism of fire during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo on the Banjšice Plateau.

After the success of the Arditi during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo all armies were ordered to raise Arditi battalions. However each army raised and employed these battalions in different ways and only after the disastrous Battle of Caporetto did the Italian High Command take control of the formation and use of the Arditi units. Each army corps was to receive an Assault Battalion organized into a battalion HQ, three Arditi companies, three machine gun sections, six machine pistol section, and six flamethrower sections. The Bersaglieri raised three Assault battalions with similar composition.

On 10 June 1918 the 1st Assault Division was created with three regiment-sized groupings of three Arditi battalions each with assigned HQ. On 25 June 1918 the 2nd Assault Division was raised and the two divisions thus formed the Assault Army Corps (&quot;Corpo d&#x27;Armata d&#x27;Assalto&quot;). Each division consisted of three groupings with two assault battalions and a Bersaglieri battalion, with an attached group HQ. Additionally each division fielded one Bersaglieri cyclists battalion, a cavalry squadron, a mountain artillery group, a sapper battalion, and various support units. The six Bersaglieri battalions in the groupings had been deployed to Libya until 28 May 1918. Additionally the corps fielded the Cyclists Assault Battalion formed on 24 June 1918 from the remaining men of the II, VI, IX, and X cyclist battalions.

The corps&#x27;s two divisions had the following structure:

=== Geographical Distribution ===
In 1914 the 1st Bersaglieri Regiment moved its depot from Sanremo to Naples to be closer to its upcoming area of deployment in Libya, while the 5th Bersaglieri Regiment moved from Ancona into the vacant barracks located at Sanremo and the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment moved from Naples to Ancona.

== Interwar years ==
After the war the nine wartime regiments were disbanded and the number of Bersaglieri battalions in the remaining regiments reduced to two per regiment. A new role was seen for the light infantry as part of Italy’s commitment to Mobile Warfare. The post-war Bersaglieri were converted into bicycle troops to fight alongside cavalry in the &quot;Celeri&quot; (fast) divisions. Elite units with high morale and an aggressive spirit were seen as one way to break such tactical stalemates as the trench warfare of 1915–18. The Bersaglieri gave Italy highly trained formations suitable for service with both cavalry and tanks. When the armoured divisions were formed in 1939, the link between the Bersaglieri and mobile warfare continued. Each new armoured and motorised division was allocated one Bersaglieri regiment.

==Interwar Period==
A single Bersaglieri regiment, the 3rd Bersagleri, took part in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in October 1935, invading from Eritrea as part of the 30th Infantry Division &quot;Sabauda&quot; under General Italo Gariboldi. There, they took part in the Christmas Offensive and the Battle of Amba Aradam, among others. The regiment was detached and sent back to Asmara in March 1936 to join a new unit, the East Africa Fast Column under Achille Starace.

==World War II==

Italy began the Second World War with twelve Bersaglieri regiments of three battalions each. Over the preceding years the Army had resisted suggestions to dilute the regiment&#x27;s quality, and recruits continued to be of above-average size and stamina, endured intense physical training and had to qualify as marksmen. During the war an additional Bersaglieri regiment, the 18th, with three battalions was raised, but only one of its battalions saw combat.

* 1st Bersaglieri Regiment (I, VII, IX battalions) – initially III Army Corps; from March 1942: 2nd Cavalry Division &quot;Emanuele Filiberto Testa di Ferro&quot;
* 2nd Bersaglieri Regiment (II, IV, XVII battalions) – garrison unit in Euboea (Greece)
* 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment (XVIII, XX, XXV battalions) – 3rd Cavalry Division &quot;Principe Amedeo Duca d&#x27;Aosta&quot;; served on the Eastern Front
* 4th Bersaglieri Regiment (XXVI, XXIX, XXXI battalions) – garrison unit in Split (Yugoslavia)
* 5th Bersaglieri Regiment (XIV, XXII, XXIV battalions) – 131st Armored Division &quot;Centauro&quot;; destroyed in the Tunisian campaign
* 6th Bersaglieri Regiment (VI, XIII, XIX battalions) – 2nd Cavalry Division &quot;Emanuele Filiberto Testa di Ferro&quot;; from March 1942: 3rd Cavalry Division &quot;Principe Amedeo Duca d&#x27;Aosta&quot; on the Eastern Front
* 7th Bersaglieri Regiment (VIII, X, XI battalions) – 102nd Motorized Division &quot;Trento&quot;; destroyed in the Tunisian campaign
* 8th Bersaglieri Regiment (III, V, XII battalions) – 132nd Armored Division &quot;Ariete&quot;; destroyed in the Tunisian campaign; reformed in July 1943
* 9th Bersaglieri Regiment (XXVIII, XXX, XXXII battalions) – 101st Motorized Division &quot;Trieste&quot;; destroyed in the Second Battle of El Alamein
* 10th Bersaglieri Regiment (XVI, XXXIV, XXXV battalions) – German Division von Broich/von Manteuffel; destroyed in the Tunisian campaign
* 11th Bersaglieri Regiment (XV, XXVII, XXXIII battalions) – 1st Cavalry Division &quot;Eugenio di Savoia&quot;; from early 1942 attached to the 158th Infantry Division &quot;Zara&quot;
* 12th Bersaglieri Regiment (XXI, XXIII, XXXVI battalions) – 133rd Armored Division &quot;Littorio&quot;; destroyed in the Second Battle of El Alamein
* 18th Bersaglieri Armored Reconnaissance Regiment (LXVII, LXVIII, LXIX battalions) – garrison unit in the South of France; in spring 1942 the LXVII battalion was sent to the Eastern Front; remaining regiment joined the 136th Armored Legionary Division &quot;Centauro&quot; on 9 September 1943 in Rome

The Bersaglieri fought in the Italian invasion of France and in the Greco-Italian War, later Bersaglieri regiments were deployed on the Eastern Front. One battalion of Bersaglieri participated in the East African Campaign. Six Bersaglieri regiments served and were destroyed during the North African Campaign.

After the Armistice of Cassibile between the Kingdom of Italy and Western Allies on 8 September 1943, Italy split in half. The Republic of Salò continued the war alongside Nazi Germany. Its Army, the fascist National Republican Army, raised the 1st Bersaglieri Division &quot;Italia&quot;, which was attached to the German 14th Army in a sector on the Northern Apennines. The division fought along the Gothic Line, and at the end of the final allied offensive, along with two Wehrmacht and the last fascist divisions, surrendered after the Battle of Collecchio.

On the other side of the front the Italian Co-belligerent Army raised a Bersaglieri battalion as part of the Combat Group &quot;Legnano&quot; from remnants of the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment.

==Cold War==
During the Cold War the Bersaglieri were exclusively employed as mechanized infantry. The three active Bersaglieri regiments were assigned to the Army&#x27;s armored divisions, with the 3rd and 8th regiments fielding two Bersaglieri and one tank battalion, while the 1st Armored Bersaglieri Regiment fielded two tank and one Bersaglieri battalion. Additionally each of the three active tank regiments fielded one Bersaglieri and two tank battalions, while the four armored infantry regiments of the motorized divisions fielded one Bersaglieri and one tank battalion each. Without exception the Bersaglieri battalions were armed with M113 armored personnel carriers.

At the end of 1974 the following Bersaglieri regiments were active:

* 1st Armored Bersaglieri Regiment, in Civitavecchia
** Command and Services Company
** I Bersaglieri Battalion
* 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment, in Milan
** Command and Services Company
** XVIII Bersaglieri Battalion
** XXV Bersaglieri Battalion, in Solbiate Olona
* 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, in Pordenone
** Command and Services Company
** III Bersaglieri Battalion
** XII Bersaglieri Battalion

At the end of 1974 the following tank regiments fielded one Bersaglieri battalion:

* 31st Tank Regiment, in Bellinzago Novarese
** XXVIII Bersaglieri Battalion
* 32nd Tank Regiment, in Tauriano
** XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion
* 132nd Tank Regiment, in Aviano
** XXXVIII Bersaglieri Battalion

Together the three Bersaglieri and three tank regiments formed the army&#x27;s two armored divisions:

* Armored Division &quot;Centauro&quot; – 1st Armored Bersaglieri, 3rd Bersaglieri, and 31st Tank Regiment
* Armored Division &quot;Ariete&quot; – 8th Bersaglieri, 32nd Tank, and 132nd Tank Regiment

The remaining four active Bersaglieri battalions were assigned to the army&#x27;s four armored infantry regiments:

* 3rd Armored Infantry Regiment, in Persano (Infantry Division &quot;Granatieri di Sardegna&quot;)
** IV Bersaglieri Battalion
* 4th Armored Infantry Regiment, in Legnano (Infantry Division &quot;Legnano&quot;)
** II Bersaglieri Battalion
* 22nd Armored Infantry Regiment &quot;Cremona&quot;, in Turin (Infantry Division &quot;Cremona&quot;)
** VI Bersaglieri Battalion
* 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment &quot;Garibaldi&quot;, in Sacile (Infantry Division &quot;Folgore&quot;)
** XI Bersaglieri Battalion

=== 1975 army reform ===
During the Italian Army reform of 1975 the regimental level was abolished and battalions became independent units under newly formed brigades. The Army formed the 3rd Mechanized Brigade &quot;Goito&quot; with the regimental command and units of the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment and the 8th Mechanized Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot; with the regimental command and units of the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment. Both brigades received one extra Bersaglieri battalion from disbanded armored infantry regiments and both fielded only personnel – with the exception of the tank crews and artillerists – from the Bersaglieri corps.

When the battalions became independent they received the flags and traditions of disbanded Bersaglieri regiments and each battalion was given an honorary name commemorating a significant event in which it had participated: e.g. the 3rd Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Cernaia&quot; received its honorary name to commemorate the conduct of the battalion during the Battle of the Chernaya in Crimea during the Crimean War in 1855. In the following list of Bersaglieri units active in 1977.

* 1st Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;La Marmora&quot;, in Civitavecchia (Mechanized Brigade &quot;Granatieri di Sardegna&quot;)
* 2nd Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Governolo&quot;, in Legnano (Mechanized Brigade &quot;Legnano&quot;)
* 3rd Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Cernaia&quot;, in Pordenone (8th Mechanized Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot;)
* 6th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Palestro&quot;, in Turin (3rd Mechanized Brigade &quot;Goito&quot;)
* 10th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Bezzecca&quot;, in Solbiate Olona (3rd Mechanized Brigade &quot;Goito&quot;)
* 11th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Caprera&quot;, in Orcenico Superiore (8th Mechanized Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot;)
* 14th Bersaglieri (Recruits Training) Battalion &quot;Sernaglia&quot;, in Albenga (3rd Army Corps)
* 18th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Poggio Scanno&quot;, in Milan (3rd Mechanized Brigade &quot;Goito&quot;)
* 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Castel di Borgo&quot;, in Tauriano (32nd Armored Brigade &quot;Mameli&quot;)
* 26th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Castelfidardo&quot;, in Maniago (8th Mechanized Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot;)
* 27th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Jamiano&quot;, in Aviano (132nd Armored Brigade &quot;Manin&quot;)
* 28th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Oslavia&quot;, in Bellinzago Novarese (31st Armored Brigade &quot;Curtatone&quot;)
* 67th Bersaglieri Battalion &quot;Fagare&quot;, in Persano (Mechanized Brigade &quot;Pinerolo&quot;)

Additionally the Bersaglieri fielded five anti-tank companies, one per Bersaglieri and one per Armored Brigade (Armored brigades Armored Brigade &quot;Manin&quot;, Armored Brigade &quot;Centauro&quot;, and Armored Brigade &quot;Mameli&quot;).

With the end of the Cold War, the Italian army began a reduction in personnel and units which also affected the Bersaglieri. On 1 June 1991 the Mechanized Brigade &quot;Goito&quot; was disbanded, while the Mechanized Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot; moved to the Southern city of Caserta, as the Army had decided to reduce the number of units in the north of Italy. The Garibaldi arrived in Caserta on 1 July 1991 and changed its name to 8th Bersaglieri Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot;. Also in 1991, the battalions of the Army were renamed as regiments without changing composition.

== Current structure ==
While in the past the mobility of the Bersaglieri manifested itself in running and the use of bicycles, regiments currently in service are all mechanised with either Dardo or Freccia infantry fighting vehicles. To distinguish them from other infantry units the Bersaglieri collar patches are crimson-red and enlisted troops wear a red fez instead of berets. Officers wear black berets with their standard uniform, but a feathered &quot;vaira&quot; when dressed in ceremonial uniform. They also wear black gloves, while other Italian regiments wear white ones. Originally each Bersaglieri regiment had a band called a &quot;fanfara&quot;, who played their instruments at the double while on parade. Today only the Garibaldi Brigade, 6th and 7th Bersaglieri Regiment retain a &quot;fanfara&quot;, which are technically brass bands.

Since 1982 Bersaglieri have served as peacekeepers with the Multinational Force in Lebanon, and during the Yugoslav and Somali Civil Wars. Bersaglier units also served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and were repeatedly deployed to serve in the war in Afghanistan. As of 2019 the following Bersaglieri units are in active service:

* 1st Bersaglieri Regiment, in Cosenza as part of the Bersaglieri Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot;)
** 1st Battalion &quot;La Marmora&quot; (Dardo IFV)
* 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment, in Teulada (Mechanized Brigade &quot;Sassari&quot;)
** 18th Battalion &quot;Poggio Scanno&quot; (Freccia IFV)
* 4th Bersaglieri Command and Tactical Supports Unit, in Caserta (Bersaglieri Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot;)
* 6th Bersaglieri Regiment, in Trapani (Mechanized Brigade &quot;Aosta&quot;)
** 6th Battalion &quot;Palestro&quot; (Freccia IFV)
* 7th Bersaglieri Regiment, in Altamura (Mechanized Brigade &quot;Pinerolo&quot;)
** 10th Battalion &quot;Bezzecca&quot; (Freccia IFV)
* 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, in Caserta (Bersaglieri Brigade &quot;Garibaldi&quot;)
** 3rd Battalion &quot;Cernaia&quot; (Dardo IFV)
* 11th Bersaglieri Regiment, in Orcenico Superiore (132nd Armored Brigade &quot;Ariete&quot;)
** 11th Battalion &quot;Caprera&quot; (Dardo IFV)
* 2nd Bersaglieri Company &quot;Pantere&quot;, in Teulada (part of the 1st Armored Regiment)
* 3rd Bersaglieri Company &quot;Celere&quot;, in Solbiate Olona (part of the Tactical and Logistic Support Regiment of the NRDC-ITA Support Brigade)

==Bugle calls==
In mid-1800 the Bersaglieri were born as light infantry sharpshooters fighting in loose skirmish formations, and specific bugle calls were used to direct the units in the confusion of the battlefield.
Each battalion had its own specific bugle call played repeatedly to rally the troops or used as a sort of &quot;address&quot; before tactical bugle calls, to identify who the order was intended for (for example, a composite bugle call could be &quot;1st Bersaglieri&quot; + &quot;Company&quot; + &quot;Right/Nr.3&quot; + &quot;Deploy in open order&quot;).

<doc id="931972" wikidata="Q7523004" url="?curid=931972" title="Singapore Idol">
<text>Singapore Idol was a Singaporean reality television singing competition produced by MediaCorp Studios and FremantleMedia Operations BV. It began airing on MediaCorp Channel 5 on 9 August 2004 until 27 December 2009, as an addition to the Idol franchise based on the British show Pop Idol, and became one of the most popular shows in the history of Singaporean television.

The concept of the series is to find new solo recording artists where the winner is determined by the viewers. The series employed a panel of judges who critique the contestants&#x27; performances. The original four judges during season 1 were singer/songwriter Dick Lee, Florence Lian, record producer Ken Lim and singer Douglas Oliverio.

In season 2, all the judges from season 1 returned to the show except for Oliverio who was replaced by singer Jacintha Abisheganaden. In season 3, Abisheganaden left the judging panel and the rest of the judges returned to the show. From the start, the show has been hosted by Singapore celebrity and funnyman Gurmit Singh. Radio deejay Daniel Ong was the co-host of the show for season 2, while season 2 winner Hady Mirza replaced him as the co-host during season 3. Through telephone and SMS text voting, Singaporean viewers chose Taufik Batisah, Hady Mirza and Sezairi Sezali as winners throughout the three seasons.

==Season 1 (2004)==
Season 1 of &quot;Singapore Idol&quot; premiered on the National Day of Singapore (9 August) in 2004. This season produced a few memorable, albeit notorious, performers during the audition round. They included Skyy Sia aka Bananaman, who wore a mask of watermelon and bananas; Kelvin Sim, who accompanied his very bad rendition of Fool&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s &quot;Lemon Tree&quot; with a dance that rivalled that of William Hung; and Patrick Khoo, who literally whispered George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;.

As with other shows in the &quot;Idol&quot; series, the viewers&#x27; votes decide who goes on to the next round. This has always produced controversial results in every singing competition. In the third preliminary round, Jerry Ong, whose singing was described by judge Florence Lian as being &quot;constipated&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;, was voted through to the finals, beating favourites Beverly Lim Morata and Nur &quot;Nana&quot; Hasanah, both of whom were thought to be better singers. Candice Foo, who got into the finals from the second preliminary round, withdrew from the contest at the last minute due to &quot;financial difficulties&quot;. In a bigger upset, Jeassea K. Thyidor, considered by many to be a frontrunner in the competition, was eliminated in the very first round of the finals by a small margin of 200 votes. This sparked a brief, two-week anti-Jerry campaign that lasted until his elimination on 15 October 2004. In the final weeks of the Spectaculars, many speculated that Olinda Cho, one of the most consistent performers, would go on to the Grand Finals with Taufik Batisah, but Sylvester Sim, who had been in the Bottom Group more than anyone else, made it through instead in an upset.

In the final showdown held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on 1 December 2004, Taufik beat Sylvester with 62% of the public vote to become the first Singapore Idol. The song both Taufik and Sylvester were required to sing was &quot;I Dream&quot;. Both received recording deals from Sony BMG on the same day. Taufik&#x27;s album, &quot;Blessings&quot;, was released on 17 January 2005. Sylvester&#x27;s album, &quot;Take Flight&quot;, was released on 8 April 2005. Another finalist, Maia Lee, also released an album titled &quot;Emotionally Advised&quot; on 20 August 2005. Sylvester was granted a release from Hype Records in mid-2006 due to personal problems. Daphne Khoo also release her debut album &#x27;Desperate&#x27; in 2008 and won Best Breakout Solo Artiste, and EP &#x27;Wonderland&#x27; in early 2014.

==Season 2 (2006)==
Auditions for season 2 were held on 11 February 2006 at *Scape in Orchard Road and was extended twice due to overwhelming response – 12 February at the same location and 19 February in Toa Payoh. The season premiered on 21 May 2006 with clips of the auditions. Dick Lee, Florence Lian and Ken Lim returned as judges while Douglas Oliverio was replaced by Jacintha Abisheganaden. After widespread criticism of his hosting abilities in season 1, Gurmit Singh was paired with Daniel Ong as co-hosts for season 2. Season 1 fourth place finalist Daphne Khoo hosted Singapore Idol on Demand, an online subscription service that provided media downloads and exclusive footage of the show.

A day after the results for Piano Show No. 4 were announced, MediaCorp revealed that a computer glitch in the voting process had mistakenly sent Mathilda D&#x27;Silva into the top 12, instead of Nurul Maideen. Mathilda was placed in the wildcard show and was subsequently voted into the finals via the Wildcard. Shortly after the technical glitch fiasco, frontrunner and wildcard contestant Meryl Joan Lee announced her withdrawal from the competition to focus on her studies.

The Top 12 finalists were housed in Hangout @ Mount Emily, a budget hotel, for as long as they remained in the competition. Once the contestant is eliminated on the results night, he/she will head back immediately to Mount Emily to pack up his/her belongings and head back home.

Every Wednesday from 12 July 2006 until the Grand Finale, the Idols competed in the Spectaculars, with a specific theme every week, for instance &quot;No. 1 Hits&quot; and &quot;British Invasion&quot;. On the following day (13 July 2006), &quot;Singapore Idol Extra&quot; showed viewers behind-the-scene footage of Singapore Idol. During the Results Show later, viewers were entertained with a live group performance, a music video of the Idols and guest appearances.

The Final Showdown for the title featured Jonathan Leong and Hady Mirza singing three songs each at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. Due to the frequency jam that took place in the first season, the finals was held on 2 separate days; the performance show on 24 September at 8:00pm, and the results show on 25 September at 8:00pm. One of the songs which both contestants sang was &quot;You Give Me Wings&quot;, which became the winner&#x27;s first single. On 25 September 2006, 26-year-old Hady Mirza was declared the winner of Singapore Idol 2006 with about 70% of the votes cast. Hady&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in mid-November 2006. Hady would then go on to compete in Asian Idol and become the first Asian Idol on 16 December 2007 in an upset victory.

==Season 3 (2009)==
On 15 December 2008, MediaCorp mentioned in its free-circulating-paper, TODAY, that Singapore Idol Season 3 would be one of the new programmes for 2009. The third season comes three years after the previous.

Registration for Singapore Idol 3 officially started on 1 May 2009, and the season premiered right after the National Day Parade on 9 August 2009, 8:30 pm on Channel 5, with subsequent episodes on Wednesdays at 8:00pm from 12 August.

Returning host Gurmit Singh co-hosted with Singapore Idol 2 winner Hady Mirza, replacing Season 2&#x27;s Daniel Ong. The returning judges were Dick Lee, Florence Lian and Ken Lim, with Jacintha Abisheganaden leaving the show.

The Top 100 contestants were put up at Orchid Country Club for a week of intense auditions and training. They were then reduced to a Top 76 for a group round, Top 54 for an Idol first where the contestants write and compose a duet and perform it, then the Top 40 of sang-off at Caldecott Hill. Top 24 consisted of half the contestants (6 males and 6 females) performing each night on 2 separate Piano Shows for a spot in the Top 12. The Piano Show has no theme, and contestants can sing any song they want. The Results Show was screened 30 minutes after the Performance Show. Voting began at the start of the Piano round at 8:00 pm, and closed at 9:45 pm (later extended to 10:00 pm and finally to 10:15 pm). The Top 3 public vote-getters, regardless of gender, advanced together with 3 of the judges choices per episode. Coincidentally, in the piano shows, all the contestants who made it to the next round by public voting were male contestants. There was no Wild Card round for previously eliminated contestants, unlike the previous two seasons.

After the Top 12 was revealed during the second Piano Show results segment, the judges announced that Mae Sta Maria would join the 12 and form a surprise Top 13. The season has received mixed to negative feedback from fans due to the new rulings (absence of the Wildcard round, lack of a gender cap and voting beginning at the start of the show rather than at the end).

It was revealed on 14 September that MJ Kuok, who had gotten into the finals by public voting after Piano Show 1, had withdrawn from the competition on 11 September, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;. The news was confirmed in &quot;8 Days&quot; Magazine. He was then replaced by Nurul Huda from Piano Show 1. It was revealed that she had received the next highest number of public votes out of all the other eliminated contestants.

This season also introduced the &quot;Judges&#x27; Save&quot;, similar to American Idol Season 8, which could be used only when the judges unanimously decide to save an eliminated contestant up to and until the Top 5. The save was never used, when the judges decided not to save Faizal Isa, who was eliminated in 5th place. In retrospect, except for the Top 13 Results Show, where Gurmit explicitly asked the judges if they wanted to save Syltra Lee, the judges&#x27; save was hardly, if only briefly, mentioned.

Another first for the franchise was a surprise non-elimination round during the Top 4 Results Show on 25 November, similar to American Idol Season 6, although, unlike the American version where the bottom group was never revealed, Charles and Tabitha were first revealed to be the bottom two before they were announced as safe. Votes for that week were added to the following week&#x27;s votes, with the contestant with the lowest-combined (Charles) being eliminated the following week.

The order for the final performance show was decided by a coin toss immediately after the Top 3 results show. Sylvia won and decided to go first. The Grand Finale, unlike Season 2, was not a two-night event. The performance was aired at 8:00 pm on 27 December 2009 and the results show at 10:00 pm on the same day. It was held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium with a full capacity of 12,000. The special guest was international recording artist Charice where she performed 3 songs which included her first single Note to God. The Singapore Idol stage will be torn down from the MediaCorp TV Theatre permanently thereafter.

This season was abound with controversy. During the Top 8 and 7, while the judges claimed both nights as &quot;girls&#x27; nights&quot;, the girls filled up the bottom groups. This resulted in extensive media promotion for the females left in the competition, and the idea of a female idol was fuelled by both the judges and the episodic trailers. However, the last male standing in the Final 3, Sezairi Sezali, still ultimately won, receiving 61% of the votes cast in the finale. While Sylvia became the first female to make it to the finals, Sezairi&#x27;s win makes all three Singapore Idol winners young Malay males.

On the results show, Gurmit Singh first revealed that Tabitha and Charles were in the &quot;bottom two&quot;. However, the two contestants were then declared safe together with Sylvia and Sezairi and no one was eliminated. Gurmit Singh stated that it was a surprise non-elimination round and votes for that week would be carried over to the following week. The contestant with the lowest combined votes over the two weeks would be eliminated the following week.

===Post-Idol===
Of the 13 Finalists, only the Top 3 contestants have continued to remain in the public eye. Sezairi Sezali and Sylvia Ratonel have released their debut studio albums, &quot;Take Two&quot; and &quot;Sylvia Ratonel&quot; respectively. Singles were released from the album and have made it into the Top 10 on the 987FM Top 20 Chart, with the best-performing single being Sylvia Ratonel&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Raining&quot; (it peaked at #3). While Tabitha Nauser has not released an album, she collaborated with international artists Sean Kingston, Steve Appleton, Jessica Mauboy and Jody Williams on the official theme song to the 2010 Youth Olympics, &quot;Everyone&quot;. Nauser was given the opening lines of the first verse, and her vocals can be heard harmonising with the other artists in the choruses and bridge. The song was released as a CD single, which included an acoustic version of &quot;Everyone&quot; performed by Nauser alone. Successful airplay of the song made &quot;Everyone&quot; reach No. 1 on the 987FM Top 20 Chart, making Tabitha Nauser the first Singaporean vocalist, at least in recent years, to achieve that feat. &quot;Everyone&quot; remained on the top spot for 2 weeks.

<doc id="931973" wikidata="Q304601" url="?curid=931973" title="Myiasis">
<text>Myiasis ( ), also known as flystrike or fly strike, is the parasitic infestation of the body of a live animal by fly larvae (maggots) that grow inside the host while feeding on its tissue. Although flies are most commonly attracted to open wounds and urine- or feces-soaked fur, some species (including the most common myiatic flies—the botfly, blowfly, and screwfly) can create an infestation even on unbroken skin. Non-myiatic flies (such as the common housefly) can be responsible for accidental myiasis.

Because some animals (particularly non-native domestic animals) cannot react as effectively as humans to the causes and effects of myiasis, such infestations present a severe and continuing problem for livestock industries worldwide, causing severe economic losses where they are not mitigated by human action. Although typically a far greater issue for animals, myiasis is also a relatively frequent disease for humans in rural tropical regions where myiatic flies thrive, and often may require medical attention to surgically remove the parasites.

Myiasis varies widely in the forms it takes and its effects on those affected. Such variations depend largely on the fly species and where the larvae are located. Some flies lay eggs in open wounds, other larvae may invade unbroken skin or enter the body through the nose or ears, and still others may be swallowed if the eggs are deposited on the lips or food. There can also be accidental myiasis that &quot;Eristalis tenax&quot; can cause in humans via water containing the larvae or in contaminated uncooked food. The name of the condition derives from ancient Greek μυῖα (&quot;myia&quot;), meaning &quot;fly&quot;.
== Signs and symptoms ==
How myiasis affects the human body depends on where the larvae are located. Larvae may infect dead, necrotic (prematurely dying) or living tissue in various sites: the skin, eyes, ears, stomach, and intestinal tract, or in genitourinary sites. They may invade open wounds and lesions or unbroken skin. Some enter the body through the nose or ears. Larvae or eggs can reach the stomach or intestines if they are swallowed with food and cause gastric or intestinal myiasis. In extremely rare cases, maggots may occasionally infest the vulvar area.

Several different presentations of myiasis and their symptoms:

===Wound===

Wound myiasis occurs when fly larvae infest open wounds. It has been a serious complication of war wounds in tropical areas and is sometimes seen in neglected wounds in most parts of the world. Predisposing factors include poor socioeconomic conditions, extremes of age, neglect, mental disability, psychiatric illness, alcoholism, diabetes, and vascular occlusive disease.

===Eye===
Myiasis of the human eye or ophthalmomyiasis can be caused by &quot;Hypoderma tarandi&quot;, a parasitic botfly of caribou. It is known to lead to uveitis, glaucoma, and retinal detachment.

==Cause==
===Life cycle===
The life cycle in sheep is typical of the disease. The female flies lay their eggs on the sheep in damp, protected areas of the body that are soaked with urine and feces, mainly the sheep&#x27;s breech (buttocks). It takes approximately eight hours to a day for the eggs to hatch, depending on the conditions. Once hatched, the larvae then lacerate the skin with their mouthparts, causing open sores. Once the skin has been breached, the larvae then tunnel through the sores into the host&#x27;s subcutaneous tissue, causing deep and irritating lesions highly subject to infection. After about the second day, bacterial infection is likely and, if left untreated, causes bacterial bloodstream infections or sepsis. This leads to anorexia and weakness and is generally fatal if untreated.

===Species affecting humans===
There are three main fly families causing economically important myiasis in livestock and also, occasionally, in humans:
* Calliphoridae (blowflies)
** Some examples include &quot;Calliphora vomitoria&quot;, &quot;Calliphora vicina&quot;, and &quot;Cordylobia&quot;
* Oestridae (botflies)
* Sarcophagidae (fleshflies) &quot;Sarcophaga barbata&quot; are usually found in dead and rotting meat and animal excrement, which are prime environments for them. This is because their larvae are facultative parasites, as they feed on organic tissue and use the hosts&#x27; oxygen reserve.

Other families occasionally involved are:
* Anisopodidae
* Piophilidae
* Stratiomyidae
* Syrphidae

====Specific myiasis====
Caused by flies that need a host for larval development:
* &quot;Dermatobia hominis&quot; (human botfly)
* &quot;Cordylobia anthropophaga&quot; (tumbu fly)
* &quot;Cordylobia rodhaini&quot; (Lund&#x27;s fly)
* &quot;Oestrus ovis&quot; (sheep botfly)
* &quot;Hypoderma&quot; spp. (cattle botflies or ox warbles)
* &quot;Gasterophilus&quot; spp. (horse botfly)
* &quot;Cochliomyia hominivorax&quot; (new world screwworm fly)
* &quot;Chrysomya bezziana&quot; (old world screwworm fly)
* &quot;Auchmeromyia senegalensis&quot; (Congo floor maggot)
* &quot;Cuterebra&quot; spp. (rodent and rabbit botfly)

====Semispecific myiasis====
Caused by flies that usually lay their eggs in decaying animal or vegetable matter, but that can develop in a host if open wounds or sores are present:
* &quot;Lucilia&quot; spp. (green-bottle fly)
* &quot;Cochliomyia&quot; spp. (screw-worm fly) 
* &quot;Phormia&quot; spp. (black-bottle fly)
* &quot;Calliphora&quot; spp. (blue-bottle fly)
* &quot;Sarcophaga&quot; spp. (flesh fly or sarcophagids)

Flesh flies, or &quot;sarcophagids&quot;, members of the family &quot;Sarcophagidae&quot;, can cause intestinal myiasis in humans if the females lay their eggs on meat or fruit.

====Accidental myiasis====
Accidental myiasis is also called pseudomyiasis. It is caused by flies that have no preference or need to develop in a host but may do so on rare occasions. Transmission occurs through accidental deposit of eggs on oral or genitourinary openings, or by swallowing eggs or larvae that are on food. The cheese fly (&quot;Piophila casei&quot;) sometimes causes myiasis through intentional consumption of its maggots (which are contained in the traditional Sardinian delicacy casu marzu). Other flies that can accidentally cause myiasis are:
* &quot;Musca domestica&quot; (housefly)
* &quot;Fannia&quot; spp. (latrine flies)
* &quot;Eristalis tenax&quot; (rat-tailed maggots)
* &quot;Muscina spp.

The adult flies are not parasitic, but when they lay their eggs in open wounds and these hatch into their larval stage (also known as maggots or grubs), the larvae feed on live or necrotic tissue, causing myiasis to develop. They may also be ingested or enter through other body apertures.

== Diagnosis ==
Myiasis is often misdiagnosed in the United States because it is rare and its symptoms are not specific. Intestinal myiasis and urinary myiasis are especially difficult to diagnose.

Clues that myiasis may be present include recent travel to an endemic area, one or more non-healing lesions on the skin, itchiness, movement under the skin or pain, discharge from a central punctum (tiny hole), or a small, white structure protruding from the lesion. Serologic testing has also been used to diagnose the presence of botfly larvae in human ophthalmomyiasis.

===Classifications===
German entomologist Fritz Zumpt describes myiasis as &quot;the infestation of live human and vertebrate animals with dipterous larvae, which at least for a period, feed on the host&#x27;s dead or living tissue, liquid body substances, or ingested food&quot;. For modern purposes, however, this is too vague. For example, feeding on dead or necrotic tissue is not generally a problem except when larvae such as those of flies in the family Piophilidae attack stored food such as cheese or preserved meats; such activity suggests saprophagy rather than parasitism; it even may be medically beneficial in maggot debridement therapy (MDT).

Currently, myiasis commonly is classified according to aspects relevant to the case in question:
* The classical description of myiasis is according to the part of the host that is infected. This is the classification used by ICD-10. For example:
** dermal
** sub-dermal
** cutaneous (B87.0)
*** creeping, where larvae burrow through or under the skin
*** furuncular, where a larva remains in one spot, causing a boil-like lesion
** nasopharyngeal, in the nose, sinuses or pharynx (B87.3)
** ophthalmic or ocular, in or about the eye (B87.2)
** auricular, in or about the ear
** gastric, rectal, or intestinal/enteric for the appropriate part of the digestive system (B87.8)
** urogenital (B87.8)
* Another aspect is the relationship between the host and the parasite which provides insight into the biology of the fly species causing the myiasis and its likely effect. Thus the myiasis is described as either:
** obligatory, where the parasite cannot complete its life cycle without its parasitic phase, which may be specific, semispecific, or opportunistic
** facultative, incidental, or accidental, where it is not essential to the life cycle of the parasite; perhaps a normally free-living larva accidentally gained entrance to the host
Accidental myiasis commonly is enteric, resulting from swallowing eggs or larvae with one&#x27;s food. The effect is called &quot;pseudomyiasis&quot;. One traditional cause of pseudomyiasis was the eating of maggots of cheese flies in cheeses such as Stilton. Depending on the species present in the gut, pseudomyiasis may cause significant medical symptoms, but it is likely that most cases pass unnoticed.

==Prevention==
The first control method is preventive and aims to eradicate the adult flies before they can cause any damage and is called. The second control method is treatment once the infestation is present, and concerns the infected animals (including humans).

The principal control method of adult populations of myiasis-inducing flies involves insecticide applications in the environment where the target livestock is kept. Organophosphorus or organochlorine compounds may be used, usually in a spraying formulation. One alternative prevention method is the sterile insect technique (SIT) where a significant number of artificially reared sterilized (usually through irradiation) male flies are introduced. The male flies compete with wild breed males for females to copulate and thus cause females to lay batches of unfertilized eggs that cannot develop into the larval stage.

One prevention method involves removing the environment most favourable to the flies, such as by removal of the tail. Another example is the crutching of sheep, which involves the removal of wool from around the tail and between the rear legs, which is a favourable environment for the larvae. Another, more permanent, practice that is used in some countries is mulesing, where the skin is removed from young animals to tighten remaining skinleaving it less prone to fly attack.

To prevent myiasis in humans, there is a need for general improvement of sanitation, personal hygiene, and extermination of the flies by insecticides. Clothes should be washed thoroughly, preferably in hot water, dried away from flies, and ironed thoroughly. The heat of the iron kills the eggs of myiasis-causing flies.

==Treatment==
This applies once an infestation is established. In many circles the first response to cutaneous myiasis once the breathing hole has formed, is to cover the air hole thickly with petroleum jelly. Lack of oxygen then forces the larva to the surface, where it can more easily be dealt with. In a clinical or veterinary setting there may not be time for such tentative approaches, and the treatment of choice might be more direct, with or without an incision. First, the larva must be eliminated through pressure around the lesion and the use of forceps. Secondly, the wound must be cleaned and disinfected. Further control is necessary to avoid further reinfestation.

Livestock may be treated prophylactically with slow-release boluses containing ivermectin, which can provide long-term protection against the development of the larvae. Sheep also may be dipped, a process that involves drenching the animals in persistent insecticide to poison the larvae before they develop into a problem.

==Epidemiology==

Myiasis is prevalent in livestock, and especially in domestic sheep. Myiasis in sheep is often caused by blowflies (&quot;Lucilia sericata&quot; and &quot;L. cuprina&quot; in particular) and is commonly referred to as blowfly strike. Blowfly strike, and other flystrike, occurs worldwide but is most common in regions where hot and wet conditions are sustained, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand. As of 2021, blowfly strike accounts for over A$280 million a year in losses for the Australian sheep industry. As mitigation, Australian sheep farmers may engage in mulesing, a procedure designed to remove strips of wool-producing skin that are the most common targets for flies. Farmers may also dock lambs&#x27; tails to reduce the likelihood of infestation. However, both mulesing and tail-docking have received criticism from animal welfare groups, who say the mitigative procedures are excessive and can have other negative effects. 

In addition to blowfly strike in sheep, myiasis from screwworm flies (&quot;Cochliomyia hominivorax&quot; in particular) regularly cause upwards of US$100 million in annual damages to domestic cows and goats. Screwworm-related myiasis is primarily mitigated through the sterile insect technique.

==History==
Frederick William Hope coined the term &quot;myiasis&quot; in 1840 to refer to diseases resulting from dipterous larvae as opposed to those caused by other insect larvae (the term for this was &quot;scholechiasis&quot;). Hope described several cases of myiasis from Jamaica caused by unknown larvae, one of which resulted in death.

Even though the term &quot;myiasis&quot; was first used in 1840, such conditions have been known since ancient times. Ambroise Paré, the chief surgeon to King Charles IX and King Henry III, observed that maggots often infested open wounds.

==Maggot therapy==

Throughout recorded history, maggots have been used therapeutically to clean out necrotic wounds, an application known as &quot;maggot therapy&quot;.

Fly larvae that feed on dead tissue can clean wounds and may reduce bacterial activity and the chance of a secondary infection. They dissolve dead tissue by secreting digestive enzymes onto the wound as well as actively eating the dead tissue with mouth hooks, two hard, probing appendages protruding on either side of the &quot;mouth&quot;. Maggot therapyalso known as maggot debridement therapy (MDT), larval therapy, larva therapy, or larvae therapyis the intentional introduction by a health care practitioner of live, disinfected green bottle fly maggots into the non-healing skin and soft tissue wounds of a human or other animal for the purpose of selectively cleaning out only the necrotic tissue within a wound to promote healing.

Although maggot therapy has been used in the US for the past 80 years, it was approved by the FDA as a medical device only in 2004 (along with leeches). Maggots were the first live organism to be marketed in the US according to FDA regulations, and are approved for treating neuropathic (diabetic) foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, and traumatic and post-surgical wounds that are unresponsive to conventional therapies. Maggots were used in medicine before this time, but were not federally regulated. In 1990, California internist Ronald Sherman began treating patients with maggots produced at his lab at the UC Irvine School of Medicine. Sherman went on to co-found Monarch Labs in 2005, which UC Irvine contracted to produce maggots for Sherman&#x27;s own continuing clinical research on myiasis at the university. Monarch Labs also sells maggots to hospitals and other medical practices, the first US commercial supplier to do so since the last one closed in 1935.

In the US, demand for these fly larvae doubled after the FDA ruling. Maggot therapy is now used in more than 300 sites across the country. The American Medical Association and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently clarified the reimbursement guidelines to the wound care community for medicinal maggots, and this therapy may soon be covered by insurance. The larvae of the green bottle fly (Lucilia fly) are now used exclusively for this purpose, since they preferentially devour only necrotic tissue, leaving healthy tissue intact. This is an important distinction, as most other major varieties of myiasitic fly larvae attack both live and dead wound tissue indiscriminately, effectively negating their benefit in non-harmful wound debridement. Medicinal maggots are placed on the wound and covered with a sterile dressing of gauze and nylon mesh. However, too many larvae placed on the wound could result in healthy tissue being eaten, efficiently creating a new wound, and rendering it a type of myiasis.

===History===
Maggot therapy has a long history and prehistory. The indigenous people of Australia used maggot therapy, and so do the Hill Peoples of Northern Burma, and possibly the Mayans of Central America. Surgeons in Napoleon&#x27;s armies recognized that wounded soldiers with myiasis were more likely to survive than those without the infestation. In the American Civil War, army surgeons treated wounds by allowing blowfly maggots to clean away the decayed tissue.

William Baer, an orthopedic surgeon at Johns Hopkins during the late 1920s, used maggot therapy to treat a series of patients with osteomyelitis, an infection of bone or bone marrow. The idea was based on an experience in World War I in which two soldiers presented to him with broken femurs after having lain on the ground for seven days without food. Baer could not figure out why neither man had a fever or signs of sepsis. He observed: &quot;On removing the clothing from the wounded part, much was my surprise to see the wound filled with thousands and thousands of maggots, apparently those of the blow fly. The sight was very disgusting and measures were taken hurriedly to wash out these abominable looking creatures.&quot; However, he then saw that the wounds were filled with &quot;beautiful pink granulation tissue&quot; and were healing well.

Maggot therapy was common in the United States during the 1930s. However, during the second half of the twentieth century, after the introduction of antibiotics, maggot therapy was used only as a last resort for very serious wounds. Lately maggots have been making a comeback due to the increased resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.

<doc id="931978" wikidata="Q7269444" url="?curid=931978" title="Quasi-continuous function">
<text>In mathematics, the notion of a quasi-continuous function is similar to, but weaker than, the notion of a continuous function. All continuous functions are quasi-continuous but the converse is not true in general.

==Definition==

Let formula_1 be a topological space. A real-valued function formula_2 is quasi-continuous at a point formula_3 if for any formula_4 and any open neighborhood formula_5 of formula_6 there is a non-empty open set formula_7 such that

: formula_8

Note that in the above definition, it is not necessary that formula_9.

==Properties==

* If formula_10 is continuous then formula_11 is quasi-continuous
* If formula_10 is continuous and formula_13 is quasi-continuous, then formula_14 is quasi-continuous.

==Example==

Consider the function formula_15 defined by formula_16 whenever formula_17 and formula_18 whenever formula_19. Clearly f is continuous everywhere except at x=0, thus quasi-continuous everywhere except (at most) at x=0. At x=0, take any open neighborhood U of x. Then there exists an open set formula_7 such that formula_21. Clearly this yields formula_22 thus f is quasi-continuous.

In contrast, the function formula_23 defined by formula_24 whenever formula_25 is a rational number and formula_26 whenever formula_25 is an irrational number is nowhere quasi-continuous, since every nonempty open set formula_28 contains some formula_29 with formula_30.

<text>Rhinatrematidae is a family of caecilians, also known as the Neotropical tailed caecilians, American tailed caecilians. or beaked caecilians. They are found in the equatorial countries of South America.

They are usually regarded as the most basal of the caecilian families, with numerous characteristics lacking in the other groups. For example, they still possess tails, and their mouths are not recessed on the underside of their heads. They lay their eggs in cavities in the soil. The larvae have external gills, and live in seepage areas until they metamorphose. The adults live in moist soil and leaf litter.

==Taxonomy==
The 14 species in three genera are:
* Genus &quot;Amazops&quot;
** &quot;Amazops amazops&quot; (Ecuador)
* Genus &quot;Epicrionops&quot;
** &quot;Epicrionops bicolor&quot; (Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia)
** &quot;Epicrionops columbianus&quot; (Colombia)
** &quot;Epicrionops lativittatus&quot; (Peru)
** &quot;Epicrionops marmoratus&quot; (Ecuador)
** &quot;Epicrionops parkeri&quot; (Colombia)
** &quot;Epicrionops peruvianus&quot; (Peru)
** &quot;Epicrionops petersi&quot; (Ecuador, Peru, and possibly Brazil and Colombia)
* Genus &quot;Rhinatrema&quot;
**&quot;Rhinatrema bivittatum&quot; (Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname)

<doc id="931990" wikidata="Q1308364" url="?curid=931990" title="Fantasy Records">
<text>Fantasy Records is an American independent record label company founded by brothers Max and Sol Stanley Weiss in 1949. The early years of the company were dedicated to issuing recordings by jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, who was also one of its investors, but in more recent years the label has been known for its recordings of comedian Lenny Bruce, jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, the last recordings made on the Wurlitzer organ in the San Francisco Fox Theatre before the theatre was demolished, organist Korla Pandit, the 1960s rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, bandleader Woody Herman, and disco and R&amp;B singer Sylvester.

==Formation==

In 1949, Jack Sheedy, owner of a San Francisco-based record label called Coronet, was talked into making the first recording of an octet and a trio featuring Dave Brubeck (not to be confused with either the Australian Coronet Records or the New York City-based Coronet Records of the late 1950s). Sheedy&#x27;s Coronet Records had recorded area Dixieland bands. But he was unable to pay his bills, and in 1949 he turned his masters over to a pressing company, the Circle Record Company, which was owned by Max and Sol Weiss. The Weiss brothers changed the name of their business to Fantasy Records and met an increasing demand for Brubeck&#x27;s music by recording and issuing new records. The company was soon shipping 40,000 to 50,000 copies of Brubeck records per quarter.

When Brubeck signed with Fantasy, he believed he had 50 percent interest in the company. He worked as an unofficial artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) assistant, encouraging the Weiss brothers to sign Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, and Red Norvo. When he discovered that all he owned was 50 percent of his own recordings, he signed with Columbia Records.

Fantasy was known for its unique colored-vinyl pressings. Monaural records were pressed in red vinyl while stereo pressings were pressed in blue. Later stereo pressings were red vinyl with a blue label. Eventually the company switched to black vinyl for all pressings and the label design went through several revisions as well.

==Acquisitions==
In 1955, Saul Zaentz joined the company. Jazz musician Charles Mingus gave Debut Records to Zaentz as a wedding gift; at the time, Zaentz was marrying Mingus&#x27;s ex-wife, Celia, who had helped found Debut with Mingus and musician Max Roach. After an unsuccessful attempt by Audio Fidelity Records to buy Fantasy, Zaentz became president in 1967. He and a group of investors bought Fantasy from the Weiss brothers that year. He then acquired Prestige Records (1971), Riverside (1972), and Milestone (1972).

Ralph Kaffel, who was vice-president of Fantasy from 1971, became president in 1973. He continued the policy of acquisitions: Stax Records (1977), Good Time Jazz (1984), Contemporary (1984), Pablo (1986), Specialty (1991), Kicking Mule (1995), and Takoma (1995).

Fantasy&#x27;s first subsidiary was Galaxy Records in 1951. Years later, it started the short-lived subsidiary Scorpio, which tried to capitalize on the British Invasion. Still later, it had a subsidiary named Reality Records that concentrated on hip hop and released the first two albums by Doug E. Fresh.

==Vince Guaraldi==
Vince Guaraldi proved a stand-out when he joined the company in 1955. His most famous contributions to Fantasy were his compositions involved in the film adaptations of the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; by Charles M. Schulz. This association began with Guaraldi&#x27;s album, &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, which contained music he created for an unsold television documentary of the same name, but became most famous with the hailed soundtrack of the classic Christmas special, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, the album of which itself has become a perennial Christmas best-seller. This success would lead to numerous other &quot;Peanuts&quot; compositions for the rest of Guaraldi&#x27;s career, selections of which were subsequently released by Fantasy. Guaraldi departed Fantasy in 1966 after the release of &quot;Live at El Matador&quot; (a collaboration with guitarist Bola Sete).
==Creedence Clearwater Revival==
Saul Zaentz&#x27;s acquisitions had been funded in part by the success of the rock group Creedence Clearwater Revival, a group that he had managed. Creedence was signed by Fantasy Records in 1964 as the Blue Velvets, but the label renamed it the Golliwogs so it would fit in with the bands of the British Invasion. After a series of failed releases under that name on the Fantasy and Scorpio labels, the group changed its name to Creedence Clearwater Revival. In 1968, it released its first hit record, a cover version of the song &quot;Susie Q&quot;.

In 1971, Fantasy built its headquarters at the corner of Tenth and Parker in Berkeley, California. The building was nicknamed &quot;The House That Creedence Built&quot;.

In 2004, Fantasy was sold to a consortium led by American television writer, producer, and activist Norman Lear and merged with Concord Records to create Concord Music Group. Although some operations were still located in Berkeley, the label was later headquartered at the Concord location in Beverly Hills, California.

Shortly after Fantasy was purchased by Concord, John Fogerty, the lead singer and songwriter of Creedence Clearwater Revival, re-signed with the label after leaving it in the mid-1970s after a falling-out with Zaentz, who died in 2014.

Fantasy Studios closed in 2018 with its studios being auctioned off, in response to financial difficulties.

<text>Csanád was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now part of Hungary, except for a small area which is part of Romania. The capital of the county was Makó.

==Geography==

Csanád county shared borders with the Hungarian counties of Csongrád, Békés, Arad and Torontál. The river Maros (Mureș) formed its southern border. Its area was 1,714 km2 around 1910.

==History==

The county&#x27;s territory became part of the Kingdom of Hungary in the first half of the 11th century when Stephen I of Hungary defeated Ajtony, the local ruler. The county got its name after the commander of the royal army, Csanád. The king appointed Gerard of Csanád as the first bishop of Csanád. The county was initially much larger and included territories of the later Temes, Arad, and Torontál counties. The first seat of the county was Csanád (present-day Cenad, Romania).

The county&#x27;s territory became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. The settlement structure was almost completely destroyed during the Ottoman–Habsburg wars. In the Treaty of Karlowitz, the Ottoman Empire renounced its claims to the territories north of the Maros (Mureș) river. Csanád county was reorganized in the returned territories (with greatly reduced size than in medieval times). Makó became the seat of the reorganized county.

After World War I, the county was occupied by the Romanian army. In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon assigned a small area in the southeast of the county (the town of Nădlac and the villages of Șeitin, Turnu and Dorobanți) to Romania. The rest of the county was united with parts of Torontál county (a small area south of Szeged) and Arad county (a small area south of Békéscsaba) to form the new county of Csanád-Arad-Torontál in 1923.

After World War II, the county was recreated, but in 1950 it was divided between the Hungarian counties of Békés and Csongrád (since 4 June 2020, the latter was renamed to Csongrád-Csanád County). The Romanian part of the former Csanád county is now part of Arad County.

==Demographics==

Csanád county was one of the most densely populated counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Hungarians formed an ethnic majority in every district except for the district of Nagylak. The main part of the Slovaks lived in the district of Nagylak, the Romanians lived mostly in the districts of Nagylak and Battonya, while the Serbs lived in the district of Battonya.

==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Csanád county were:
The town of Nădlac is now in Romania; the other towns mentioned are now in Hungary.

<text>Six tennis events were contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom.
Indoor tennis events, on what were officially called &#x27;covered courts&#x27;, were held for the first time, along with the usual outdoor events. Women&#x27;s events were contested, with women&#x27;s singles (but not women&#x27;s doubles or mixed doubles) and indoor women&#x27;s singles. The indoor events were held at the covered courts of the Queen&#x27;s Club and began on 6 May 1908, ahead of the official start of the Games while the outdoor tournament was played on grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Worple Road from 6 July through 11 July 1908. In total 50 players, 40 men and 10 women, competed. Five nations made their tennis debuts, while five more returned to competition for a total of ten nations. Two players, Les Poidevin and Wimbledon champion Anthony Wilding were nominated for Australasia but through administrative bungling they were not entered.

Belfast, Northern Ireland was the venue for roller skating events (at the Kings Hall), as well as the Special Olympics Scientific Symposium (held from 19 to 20 June).

==The Games==

The 2003 World Games were the first to be held outside of the United States. This was the largest sporting event held in 2003.

===Opening ceremony===
The opening ceremony was held in Croke Park and featured an array of stars and was hosted by comedian Patrick Kielty. The band U2 were a major feature, and Nelson Mandela officially opened the games. Other performances included The Corrs and the largest Riverdance troupe ever assembled on one stage. 75,000 athletes and spectators were in attendance at the opening ceremonies. Irish and international celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jon Bon Jovi walked with the athletes, with Muhammad Ali as a special guest and Manchester United and Republic of Ireland football player Roy Keane taking the athletes oath with one of the Special Olympians.

The Games Flame was lit at the culmination of the Law Enforcement Torch Run, which more than 2,000 members of the Garda Síochána (Irish Police) and the Police Service of Northern Ireland took part in. This was a series of relays carrying the Special Olympics Torch, the &quot;Flame of Hope&quot;, from Europe to the Games&#x27; official opening.

The ceremony was officially opened by President of Ireland Mary McAleese and attended by Taoiseach (Prime Minister of Ireland) Bertie Ahern.

===Organisation===
The organising committee, which was formed in 1999 following the success of the bid, was chaired by entrepreneur Denis O&#x27;Brien. The chief executive was Mary Davis.

The 2003 games were the first to have their opening and closing schemes broadcast on live television, and Radio Telefís Éireann provided extensive coverage of the events through their &#x27;Voice of the Games&#x27; radio station which replaced RTÉ Radio 1 on Medium Wave for the duration of the event. There was also a nightly television highlight programme.

Among the activities carried out during the Games were thorough medical checks on the athletes, some of whom had previously undiagnosed conditions uncovered, as some of the athletes came from countries with limited medical facilities or had difficulty communicating their symptoms.

A daily newspaper, the Games Gazette was published for each day of the games.

Among the contributors to the Games was the Irish Prison Service. Prisoners in Mountjoy Prison, Midlands Prison, Wheatfield Prison and Arbour Hill Prison who constructed podiums and made flags, towels, signs, benches and other equipment.

===Volunteer programme===
30,000 volunteer officials and support staff assisted in the running of the games, including 900 staff of the Bank of Ireland who coordinated the host town programme, and 800 members of the Irish Defence Forces who maintained the radio communication network, and provided support for bridge building, security duties, VIP drivers, standard bearers for ceremonial events. The Irish Red Cross, Order of Malta and St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland provided emergency medical teams at the event sites. Approximately 1,300 members of both Scouting Ireland (CSI) and Scouting Ireland SAI staffed the Awards Teams for all the disciplines throughout the games. 165 volunteers from the then 15 countries of the EU took part in a European Volunteer Project (EVS), the first ever to be organized in event-related mode. The volunteers are commemorated by having their names on a series of plaques situated in Dublin Castle, just outside the Chester Beatty Library.

==Participating teams==
Approximately 6500 athletes from 166 countries competed in the games in 18 official disciplines, and three exhibition sports. The participants from Kosovo were the region&#x27;s first team at an international sporting event.- A 12-member team from Iraq received special permission to attend the games, despite ongoing war in their home nation. Ireland was represented by an all-island team with athletes from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Athletes from Taiwan competed under the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. Athletes from the United States were grouped into eight regional teams; Great Lakes, Mid Atlantic, New England, North Central, North West, South Central, South East, South West.

Ireland&#x27;s Department of Health has initially bared athletes from areas affected by the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. This affected athletes from parts of China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan; as well as Toronto in Canada. However no country was ultimate banned from participating with Hong Kong and Taiwan&#x27;s athletes undergoing quarantine.

<text>Hip Records was a daughter label of Stax Records. It was formed around 1967 for the purpose of recording and releasing material by Memphis and regional rock bands and groups. The Stax label had always recorded a small amount of non-soul material, and a few white rock bands like The Barracudas, The Cobras and the Memphis Nomads had releases on the Stax label itself. But after 1967, Stax began to set up new labels for different genres, Enterprise for jazz and Hip for rock and roll. Jim Stewart imported singer Sharon Tandy from England to launch the label. Initially a singles label, Hip began to release albums after Stax&#x27;s acquisition by Gulf &amp; Western/Paramount in 1968. Albums were released by Paris Pilot, The Goodees, The Southwest F.O.B. and The Knowbody Else (Black Oak Arkansas). In 1969, Don Nix was named head of the Enterprise label, and Hip was discontinued. Stax began placing most of its rock, country and jazz on Enterprise going forward.

<doc id="932019" wikidata="Q201902" url="?curid=932019" title="Mole Antonelliana">
<text>The Mole Antonelliana () is a major landmark building in Turin, Italy, named after its architect, Alessandro Antonelli. A &quot;&quot; in Italian is a building of monumental proportions.

Construction began in 1863, soon after Italian unification, and was completed in 1889, after the architect&#x27;s death. Originally conceived of as a synagogue, it now houses the National Museum of Cinema, and is believed to be the tallest museum in the world. A representation of the building is featured on the obverse of the Italian 2 euro cent coin. Catalan vaults are featured in the ceiling of the ground floor under the atrium, which are relatively rare in Italy but popular in Spain, where they originated.

==History==
===Construction===
The building was conceived and constructed as a synagogue. The Jewish community of Turin had enjoyed full civil rights since 1848, and at the time the construction of the synagogue began, Turin was the capital of the new Italian state, a position it held only from 1860 to 1864. The community, with a budget of 250,000 lire and the intention of having a building worthy of a capital city, hired Alessandro Antonelli. Antonelli had recently added a dome and spire to the seventeenth-century Basilica of San Gaudenzio in Novara and promised to build a synagogue for 280,000 lire.

The relationship between Antonelli and the Jewish community was not happy. He proposed a series of modifications which raised the final height to , over meters higher than the dome in the original design. Such changes, in addition to greater costs and construction time than were originally anticipated, did not please the Jewish community and construction was halted in 1869, with a provisional roof.

With the transfer of the Italian capital to Florence in 1864, the community shrank, but costs and Antonelli&#x27;s ambition continued to rise. In 1876, the Jewish community, which had spent 692,000 lire for a building that was still far from finished, announced that it was withdrawing from the project. The people of Turin, who had watched the synagogue rise skyward, demanded that the city take over the project, which it did. An exchange was arranged between the Jewish community and the city of Turin for a piece of land on which a handsome Moorish Revival synagogue was quickly built. The Mole was dedicated to Victor Emmanuel II. Antonelli resumed construction, increasing the height to , , and finally . He worked on the project until his death in October 1888.

Antonelli&#x27;s original vision for the spire was to top it off with a five-pointed star, but he later opted for a statue instead, depicting an angel, or &quot;genio alato&quot; - one symbol of the House of Savoy. The statue was commissioned to the sculptor Fumagalli, months after Antonelli&#x27;s death. The design included an embossed and gilded copper genie holding a lance in one hand and a palm branch in the other. On its head was a small five-pointed star supported by a pole. When the star was set in its place on 10 April 1889, it brought the total height of the Mole to , making it the tallest brick building in Europe at the time.

From 1908 to 1938, the city used the Mole to house its Museum of the Risorgimento, which was moved to the Palazzo Carignano in 1938.

The Mole Antonelliana is the tallest unreinforced brick building in the world (built without a steel girder skeleton).

===Repairs===
On 11 August 1904, a violent storm caused the winged genie to collapse, but luckily it stayed suspended against one of the terraces of the structure. Following reconstruction work, it was replaced by a 5-pointed star made of copper and measuring 4 meters in diameter. The design, by Ernesto Ghiotti, was similar to the original one seen on the head of the genie, and fell in 1953: it has been later replaced by a smaller three-dimensional, 12-pointed star.

During the Second World War, the building largely escaped the bombings of 6 December 1942, which hit many military targets in nearby Via Verdi, and destroyed the neighbouring Teatro di Torino.

On 23 May 1953, a violent cloudburst, accompanied by a tornado, destroyed the uppermost of the pinnacle, which was rebuilt in 1961 as a metal structure faced with stone. Guido Chiarelli carried out the project for the lighting of the pinnacle, at the end of the reconstruction work.

===Present===

Since 2000, the building has housed the Museo Nazionale del Cinema (National Museum of Cinema). The Mole appears on the reverse of the two-cent Italian euro coins and was the inspiration for the official emblem of the 2006 Winter Olympics, as well as those of the 2005 World Bocce Championships and the 2006 World Fencing Championships.

The building also lent its name to one of Italian football&#x27;s oldest derbies, the Derby della Mole, between Turin football clubs Torino and Juventus.

On one side of the four-faced dome, the first Fibonacci numbers are written with red neon lights: they are part of the artistic work &quot;Il volo dei Numeri&quot; (&quot;Flight of the Numbers&quot;) by Mario Merz.

In December 2017, the Mole was illuminated with over 6000 LED lights, an unprecedented event to mark 110 years since the establishment of Aem Torino, Iren, a company that supplies electricity to the city.

==In popular culture==
Friedrich Nietzsche greatly admired the building, associating it with the figure Zarathustra and wrote, &quot;Earlier I walked past the Mole Antonelliana, perhaps the most brilliant work of architecture ever built—strangely, it has no name—as a result of an absolute drive into the heights—it recalls nothing so much as my Zarathustra. I baptized it &quot;Ecce homo&quot; and in that spirit placed an enormous free space around it.&quot;

The Mole was featured in the fourth leg of the American reality competition show &quot;The Amazing Race 20&quot;.
The building (including the interior with its Museum of Cinema) was used extensively in the 2004 Italian film &quot;Dopo Mezzanotte&quot; (&quot;After Midnight&quot;).

A stylized version of the building appeared in the logo for the 2006 Winter Olympics.

<text>Homestead Records was a Long Island, New York–based sublabel of music distributor Dutch East India Trading that operated from 1983 to 1996. The label was known for not paying its artists and not spending any money on promotion.

==History==
The label was created and named by Sam Berger while he worked as the American Independent buyer at Dutch East India. Berger saw that many bands had already recorded tapes ready to be put out and just needed somebody to press them and distribute them. He came to Dutch East India owner Barry Tenenbaum who agreed to the venture. Tennenbaum had started a mail-order business, called Lord Sitar Records, from his bedroom when he was a teenager, importing records by the Beatles and other artists from England that he could sell for a profit in the States. Tenenbaum had established an extensive distribution network, called Dutch East India Trading, so when the Copyright Act of 1976 curtailed his ability to import artists who already had U.S. labels, he began licensing records for release and created the Homestead Records imprint for this purpose. 

Berger left Homestead in 1984 and was replaced by Gerard Cosloy, the creator of the underground art fanzine &quot;Conflict&quot;. Cosloy would be the sole employee of the label until 1987 when Craig Marks was hired to assist him in running the label. Cosloy and Marks both resigned in 1990. Ken Katkin was the manager from 1990 to 1992, and Steven Joerg from 1992 to 1996. The label closed in 1996 with its last release being Ivo Perelman&#x27;s &quot;Cama de Terra&quot;.

<doc id="932026" wikidata="Q2577718" url="?curid=932026" title="Skidder">
<text>A skidder is any type of heavy vehicle used in a logging operation for pulling cut trees out of a forest in a process called &quot;skidding&quot;, in which the logs are transported from the cutting site to a landing. There they are loaded onto trucks (or in times past, railroad cars or flumes), and sent to the mill. One exception is that in the early days of logging, when distances from the timberline to the mill were shorter, the landing stage was omitted altogether, and the &quot;skidder&quot; would have been used as the main road vehicle, in place of the trucks, railroad, or flume. Modern forms of skidders can pull trees with a cable and winch (&quot;cable skidder&quot;), just like the old steam donkeys, or with a hydraulic grapple either on boom (&quot;grapple skidder&quot;) or on the back of the frame &quot;(clambunk skidder)&quot;.

==History==

Early skidders were pulled by a team of oxen, horses or mules. The driver would straddle the cart over felled logs, where dangling tongs would be positioned to raise the end of the log off the ground. The team pulled the tongue forward, allowing the log to &quot;skid&quot; along between the rolling wheels. These were known as &quot;slip-tongue wheels&quot; Starting in the early 1920s, animals were gradually replaced by gasoline-powered crawlers, although some small operations continue to use horses. In other places, steel &quot;arches&quot; were used behind the crawlers. Similar in function to the slip-tongue wheels, arches were used to reduce friction by raising up one end of the load, which was dangled from a cable which in turn ran down the back of the arch, and was raised or lowered by the crawler&#x27;s winch. Another piece similar to the arch was the &quot;bummer&quot;, which was simply a small trailer to be towed behind a crawler, on top of which one end of the log load would rest.
The early mechanical skidders were steam powered. They traveled on railroads, known as &quot;dummylines&quot; and the felled trees were dragged or &quot;skidded&quot; to the railroad where they were later loaded onto rail cars. Some, such as the steam donkeys, were relatively simple but other mechanical skidders were more complex. The largest of these mechanical skidders was the Lidgerwood skidder, which not only brought logs to the landing from the cutting site, but loaded them onto railroad cars as well, making it both a skidder and loader. One popular brand was the Clyde Skidder, built by Clyde Ironworks in Duluth, Minnesota. The Clyde was capable of retrieving logs from four different points at the same time. Each cable, or lead, was approximately in length. Once the logs were attached and a clearance signal was sent for retrieval, they could be skidded at a speed of . In New Zealand cables were run five miles. Working conditions around these machines were very dangerous.

== Modern equivalents ==

Contemporary skidders are tracked or four wheel drive tractors with a diesel engine, winch and steel, funnel-shaped guards on the rear to protect their wheels. They have articulated steering and usually a small, adjustable, push-blade on the front. The operator/logger is protected from falling or flying debris (or parted cables, or rolling over) by a steel enclosure. They are one of the few logging machines that is capable of thinning or selective logging in larger timber. Forwarders can haul small short pieces out, however a skidder is one of the few options for taking out some trees while leaving others when thinning mature lumber.

The skidder can also be used for pulling tree stumps, pushing over small trees, and preliminary grading of a logging path known as a &quot;skid road&quot;.

While wood is being yarded (pulled) by the skidder, tree particles and seeds are cultivated into the soil.

Skidder logging can be disadvantageous in thinning operations due to the damage caused to remaining trees as branches and trunks are dragged against them, tearing away the protective bark of living trees. Another ecological concern is the deep furrows in the topsoil sometimes made by skidders, especially when using tires with chains, which alter surface runoff patterns and increases the costs of forest rehabilitation and reforestation.

===Versions===

==== Logging arch ====
A device similar to a skip tongue log skidder except that it is made of steel, including the spoked wheels

====Cable skidders====

On a cable skidder, the cable is reeled out and attached to a pull of cut timber, then the winch pulls the load toward the skidder. The winch or grapple holds the trees while the skidder drags them to a landing area. Cable skidders are more labor-intensive than grapple skidders because someone (the operator or a second person) must drag the winch line out to the logs and hook them up manually. Nowadays, cable skidders are less popular than in the past. These machines are most useful in areas where it is not possible to drive the machine close to the log (such as in steep hills).

====Grapple skidders====

Grapple skidders use a loader crane boom with a hydraulic grapple bucket to grab and lift the timber.

There are three types of &#x27;fixed boom&#x27; grapple skidders. A single-function boom type has two hydraulic cylinders, only allowing the boom to lower in one position. Dual-function booms (as pictured) have four cylinders, which allows for adjusting the boom in two different places. The third type permits the grapple boom to be swung from side to side, allowing spread out trees to be grabbed at once.

In some areas, loggers have combined a hydraulic claw on the side with the blade of their grapple skidders, making it possible to pile logs in some cases. More common on cable skidders, this also permits hauling back bark and tops when returning from a landing area to fallen timber.

Clambunk skidders

Clambunk skidders are more of a middle ground between skidder and a forwarder. They have large free swiveling hydraulic jaws positioned on the back of the chassis that clamp the logs. They usually don&#x27;t have self-loading capability and require feller buncher or other machine with loader arm.

<doc id="932030" wikidata="Q239688" url="?curid=932030" title="Gianluca Vialli">
<text>Gianluca Vialli (; 9 July 1964 – 5 January 2023) was an Italian football player and manager who played as a striker. Vialli started his club career at his hometown club Cremonese in 1980, where he made 105 league appearances and scored 23 goals. His performances impressed Sampdoria, who signed him in 1984 and with whom he scored 85 league goals, won three Italian cups, Serie A and the European Cup Winners Cup.

In 1992, Vialli transferred to Juventus for a world record £12.5 million. During his time at the Turin club, he won the Italian Cup, Serie A, Italian Supercup, UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup. In 1996, Vialli joined Chelsea and became their player-manager the following season. In England, he won the FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Cup Winners Cup and UEFA Super Cup. He is one of nine footballers to have won the three main European club competitions and the only forward to have done so; he is also the only player in European footballing history to hold both winners and runners-up medals in all three mainstream UEFA club competitions, including two winners medals for the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

At international level, Vialli represented the Italy national team in two FIFA World Cups, in 1986 and (on home soil) in 1990. He also took part at UEFA Euro 1988, helping his nation to a semi-final finish, and was elected to the team of the tournament. During his twenty-year-long career as a professional footballer, he scored 259 goals at club level, 16 goals with the national team, and 11 goals with the Italy national under-21 football team, for a total of 286 goals in more than 500 appearances, making him the tenth-highest scoring Italian player in all competitions.

On his retirement from playing, Vialli went into management and later punditry, and worked as a commentator for Sky Italia. He was part of the Italy national team non-playing staff as a coordinator when they won UEFA Euro 2020; he stepped back from this role days before his death from cancer.

==Club career==
===Cremonese===
Vialli&#x27;s senior career started in 1980 when he signed for local club Cremonese in Serie C1, winning promotion to Serie B. After scoring ten goals for the club as a winger in the 1983–84 Serie B season, he was transferred to Sampdoria.

===Sampdoria===
Vialli played for Sampdoria between 1984 and 1992, during which time the club had their most successful period in their history. At Sampdoria, he formed a prolific strike partnership with teammate and friend Roberto Mancini, earning the nickname &#x27;The Goal Twins&#x27; (in Italian &quot;I Gemelli del Gol&quot;). Vialli also had a very good relationship with club president Paolo Mantovani and coach Vujadin Boškov, who were both described by Vialli as being father figures. Sampdoria won their first ever Italian Cup in 1985 with Vialli scoring in the final, and would win it again in 1988 and 1989, when Vialli would score a record 13 goals in the tournament. This led to two notable European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup runs, where Sampdoria lost the 1989 final before winning the trophy in 1990, with Vialli scoring both goals in the final victory over Anderlecht, and finishing the tournament as top-scorer.

Despite losing out to Milan in the 1990 European Super Cup, the club went on to win their first ever Serie A championship in the 1990–91 season, in which Vialli was league top scorer with 19 goals – celebrating many of his goals with a backflip, including one against Inter Milan. The following season, Sampdoria won the Supercoppa Italiana and reached the European Cup final, but Vialli would miss a number of chances as Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona &quot;Dream Team&quot; won 1–0. This would be his last game with Sampdoria.

===Juventus===
Vialli moved to Juventus shortly after the 1992 European Cup final loss for a world record fee of £12.5 million. His first Juventus contract was negotiated for him by Sampdoria president Mantovani, as Vialli did not have an agent. Although he struggled with injury, Vialli won the UEFA Cup in his first season with Juventus playing alongside players such as Roberto Baggio, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Paolo Di Canio and Andreas Möller, among other players, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. During the 1993 UEFA Cup Final against Borussia Dortmund, Vialli set-up Baggio&#x27;s decisive first goal in the first leg.

Following the arrival of manager Marcello Lippi, Vialli underwent an intense fitness and muscle strengthening training regime to lose weight, and gain speed, agility, physical strength, and stamina. Vialli refound his goalscoring form throughout the season, and through his leadership and decisive performances, he helped Juventus win the Scudetto (his second overall) and the Italian Cup in 1995, scoring 17 league goals during the season; the club also narrowly missed out on a treble after suffering a defeat in the 1995 UEFA Cup Final to Parma, despite Vialli scoring a spectacular second leg goal.

In January 1996, with his contract expiring in summer, Vialli decided to leave Juventus at the end of the season. He would finish his final season with Juventus by captaining the side to a Supercoppa Italiana victory (with Vialli scoring the only goal of the match) and a Champions League final win over defending champions AFC Ajax, playing alongside Del Piero and Fabrizio Ravanelli. Vialli&#x27;s only two goals in the latter competition came in the semi-finals against Nantes; he scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home victory in the first-leg, and then scored again during the second leg, in addition to assisting Paulo Sousa&#x27;s decisive goal, which allowed Juventus to advance to the final 4–3 on aggregate. During his four seasons with the club he totalled 102 appearances, scoring 38 goals.

===Chelsea===
Vialli joined Chelsea in the summer of 1996 on a free transfer as part of manager Ruud Gullit&#x27;s rebuilding of the side, despite having been strongly linked with Scottish champions Rangers. Vialli adapted quickly to life in London due to his grasp of the English language and use of English idioms. The team won the FA Cup in Vialli&#x27;s first season, with the Italian scoring two goals in a 4–2 comeback over Liverpool in the fourth round. However, a feud with Gullit saw him regularly left out of the starting line-up; in the final itself he was limited to a five-minute appearance as a late substitute.

During the 1997–98 season, Vialli scored four goals in a league win over Barnsley and a hat-trick against Norwegian side Tromsø in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, but still could not cement his place in the side under Gullit. However, following Gullit&#x27;s dismissal in early 1998, Vialli assumed the role of a player-manager, winning the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1998, and the League Cup. Although he left himself out of the squad for the League Cup final, Vialli finished the season as Chelsea&#x27;s top scorer. He then began his first full season as player-manager with a 1–0 victory over Champions League winners Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup.

Vialli retired from professional football at the end of the 1998–99 season to focus on his position as Chelsea&#x27;s manager. He made his last professional appearance in Chelsea&#x27;s final match of the 1998–99 Premier League, scoring the winning goal against Derby County at Stamford Bridge and finishing his Chelsea career with 83 appearances and 40 goals.

==Managerial career==

===Chelsea===
Gullit was sacked as Chelsea manager in February 1998 and 33-year-old Vialli was appointed player-manager, becoming the first Italian to manage in the Premier League. Chelsea were already in the semi-finals of the League Cup and the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and went on to win both competitions under Vialli, as well as finishing fourth in the Premier League. In beating VfB Stuttgart at the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final on 13 May 1998, at 33 years and 308 days old, Vialli became the youngest manager ever to win a UEFA competition. The record stood for thirteen years until 18 May 2011 when FC Porto&#x27;s André Villas-Boas won the Europa League at the age of 33 years and 213 days.

The following season Chelsea won the UEFA Super Cup by beating Real Madrid 1–0, and finished third in the Premier League, just four points behind champions Manchester United in what was Chelsea&#x27;s highest league finish since 1970, when they also finished third. After this, Vialli retired from playing.

The following season saw Chelsea make their debut in the UEFA Champions League, where they reached the quarter-finals. After a 3–1 first leg victory over Barcelona, they were eventually knocked out 4–6 on aggregate following a 5–1 return leg loss at Camp Nou after extra time. Despite a fifth-place finish in the Premier League, the campaign ended on a high note when Vialli guided Chelsea to a win over Aston Villa in the 2000 FA Cup final.

The 2000–01 season started brightly, with Chelsea beating Manchester United to win the Charity Shield, Vialli&#x27;s fifth official trophy with the club in less than three years. Vialli was sacked five games into the season after an indifferent start and having fallen out with several players, including Gianfranco Zola, Didier Deschamps and Dan Petrescu.

===Watford===
Vialli then took up an offer to manage First Division club Watford in 2001–02. The club invested in a number of high-profile signings including AC Milan icon Filippo Galli, Ramon Vega, Patrick Blondeau and Pierre Issa, but only finished an unimpressive 14th and Vialli was sacked after one year. Following this, he was drawn into a lengthy dispute with the club over the payment of the remainder of his contract.

==International career==
Vialli was a member of Italy&#x27;s under-21 team for both the 1984 and 1986 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championships where the Azzurrini finished third and second respectively. Overall Vialli represented the Italy U21 team 20 times, scoring 11 goals. He was also the top scorer in the 1986 Under-21 European Championship, with 4 goals, where Italy lost the final to Spain on penalties.

In 1985, Vialli made his debut for the Italy senior team in a friendly match against Poland. He was included in Italy&#x27;s squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico, appearing with an all-shaved head as a substitute in all four of Italy&#x27;s matches as back-up for Bruno Conti.

Vialli scored his first goal for Italy in a UEFA Euro 1988 qualifier against Malta in 1986. He was included in Italy&#x27;s squad for the finals of the Euro 1988 competition and scored the winning goal against Spain in the group stage. Although Italy were knocked out by the Soviet Union in the semi-final after losing 0–2, Vialli was named in UEFA&#x27;s team of the tournament.

With the 1990 FIFA World Cup being held on home soil, Vialli named part of the squad and he was expected to make a huge impact for the hosts. However, after failing to score in the first match against Austria, despite setting up the winning goal via a cross, Vialli missed a penalty against the United States in the next match, hitting the lower near post with keeper Tony Meola diving the other way; he did play a role in the decisive goal, however, scored by Giuseppe Giannini, with his dummy on Roberto Donadoni&#x27;s pass, following a team move. He was subsequently dropped from the team in favour of the attacking duo of Roberto Baggio and Salvatore Schillaci, the latter of whom had scored the winning goal against Austria from Vialli&#x27;s assist, after appearing as a substitute. Vialli returned to the team for the semi-final against Argentina and played a role in Italy&#x27;s opening goal after his shot on goal was blocked by Argentina keeper Goycochea and the rebound fell to Schillaci. He was substituted in the second half as Italy were eliminated on penalties, eventually finishing the tournament in third place. Because Italy assigned jersey numbers alphabetically to players for the World Cup (beginning with defenders, then midfielders, and finally attackers) Vialli wore the number 21 during the World Cup. Overall, he finished the tournament with two assists, which were both provided for the golden boot winner Schillaci.

Vialli returned to lead Italy&#x27;s attack during the qualifying games for the UEFA Euro 1992 Championship under manager Vicini, scoring in Italy&#x27;s 3–1 win over Hungary and 2–0 win over Cyprus in 1991. However, Italy missed out on qualifying after finishing second behind the Soviet Union in Group 3.

Vialli made his last appearance for the Azzurri in December 1992; his strained relationship with coach Arrigo Sacchi brought his international career to a premature end, despite his club success during the 1990s. It is rumoured that Vialli played a prank on Sacchi, which was the reason for his dropping from the national team.

Overall, Vialli made 59 appearances for Italy, scoring 16 goals.

==Style of play==
Considered one of the best and most consistent Italian strikers of his generation, Vialli was a complete, dynamic, determined, and versatile forward, who was capable of playing anywhere along the front line; throughout his career, he was played on the wing, or in a deeper, supporting role, although his preferred position was in the centre as a main striker, where he could best take advantage of his offensive movement and opportunism inside the box, as well as his keen eye for goal. A prolific goalscorer, Vialli was known for his shooting power and accuracy with both feet as well as his head, which allowed him to finish off chances both inside and outside the penalty area.

In addition to his ability to score goals, Vialli was also capable of playing off of and creating chances for his teammates, courtesy of his good vision, tactical intelligence, and distribution, which also occasionally saw him play in deeper roles in midfield, as a playmaker or attacking midfielder; he was also endowed with good technical ability, dribbling skills, and ball control, which allowed him to play the ball first time, or beat opponents and retain possession under pressure. A quick, tenacious, hardworking, and energetic player, Vialli was gifted with pace, physicality, and stamina, and was known for his willingness to press opponents off the ball to win back possession. Vialli was seen as a new breed of striker in Italian football, who combined technique and goalscoring ability with speed, athleticism, and physical power.

Because of his outstanding athleticism, strength, and agility, he also excelled in the air, and had a penchant for scoring acrobatic goals from volleys and bicycle kicks, which led his Juventus manager Marcello Lippi and president Gianni Agnelli at the time to praise him and compare him to legendary Italian striker Gigi Riva. In addition to his footballing skills, he was also highly regarded for his dedication, leadership qualities, strong mentality, and his charismatic influence on the pitch. Marino Bortoletti of &quot;Treccani&quot; described Vialli as a &quot;modern striker, gifted with power and style&quot;, and as &quot;the most representative player of his generation&quot;, along with compatriots Roberto Baggio and Franco Baresi.

==Outside of professional football==

In 2006, Vialli released &quot;The Italian Job: A Journey to the Heart of Two Great Footballing Cultures&quot;, co-written with his close friend and football journalist, Gabriele Marcotti. Written over a period of two and a half years from November 2003 until early 2006, the book discusses the differences between English and Italian football. He also attributes his tendency to play as a wide attacker to playing on a field that was short and wide as a young boy. Vialli donated the proceeds of the book to the &quot;Fondazione Vialli e Mauro per la ricerca e lo sport&quot;, which is a charitable foundation he founded together with former player Massimo Mauro to raise funds for research into cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

From the late 2000s Vialli worked as a TV football commentator for Sky Italia. In 2007, he was linked with a move to the manager&#x27;s position at Queens Park Rangers, following the club takeover by Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone and the dismissal of John Gregory as manager, but ultimately declined any interest in the job. During UEFA Euro 2012, he appeared as a pundit for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the tournament.

Vialli, alongside ex-Morgan Stanley and -Goldman Sachs investment banker Fausto Zanetton, co-founded Tifosy, a sports investment platform, with the aim of allowing anybody to invest in professional sports. Zanetton, its CEO, explained that &quot;whilst there is an incredible passion and willingness to invest in sports, there is currently no way to do so for the average fan or investor...You no longer need to be a billionaire to invest in professional sports clubs.&quot; At Web Summit 2016, Vialli discussed his latest venture with Tifosy.

In October 2019, Vialli was appointed new delegation chief of the Italy national football team under head coach and personal friend Roberto Mancini (his former teammate and striking partner at Sampdoria), a position unfilled since Gigi Riva&#x27;s retirement in 2013. On 11 July 2021, Italy won UEFA Euro 2020 after a 3–2 victory in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw after extra-time against England in the final.

==Personal life and death==
He was born into a wealthy family, being raised in the 60-room Castello di Belgioioso in Cremona. His father is a &quot;self-made millionaire&quot;; it is often reported that his father is a billionaire but this was denied by his mother. He married Cathryn White-Cooper on 26 August 2003 and fathered two daughters, Olivia and Sofia. Vialli was a keen golfer and played at the Dunhill links championship pro-am event. He continued to live in the SW6 postcode of London 20 years after leaving Chelsea F.C.

In November 2018, Vialli revealed that he had successfully overcome a year-long illness with pancreatic cancer. He was treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. He was given the all-clear from pancreatic cancer in April 2020, but in December 2021 revealed that he had been diagnosed with the disease for a second time. He died on the night between 5 and 6 January 2023, in the Royal Marsden Hospital, at age 58.

On 9 September 2023, Chelsea played a legends match against Bayern Munich – a rematch of the 2012 Champions League Final – at Stamford Bridge in Vialli&#x27;s memory. Chelsea won 4–0 with proceeds benefiting The Chelsea Foundation and The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.

<doc id="932032" wikidata="Q643460" url="?curid=932032" title="Krassó-Szörény County">
<text>Krassó-Szörény (Hungarian: &quot;Krassó-Szörény&quot;, Romanian: &quot;Caraș-Severin&quot;, Serbian: &quot;Karaš-Severin&quot; or Караш-Северин) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the historic Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now mostly located in south-western Romania, with one very small part which is located in Serbia. The capital of the county was Lugos (present-day Lugoj).

==Geography==

Krassó-Szörény County was located in the Banat region. It shared borders with the Kingdom of Serbia and the Hungarian counties of Temes, Arad and Hunyad. The river Danube formed its southern border, and the river Mureș its northern border. The rivers Bega, Timiș, Bârzava, Caraș, Nera and Cerna flowed through the county. Its area was around 1910.

==History==

Krassó-Szörény county was formed in 1881 by uniting the counties of Krassó (its center was Lugos/Lugoj) and Szörény (its center was Karánsebes/Caransebeș). Previously, Krassó County had been re-established in 1779, with significantly different borders than in medieval times, while Szörény County had only been established in 1873 (it was the shortest-lived county in the modern Kingdom of Hungary), mostly on the territory of the former Vlach Regiment of the Banat Military Frontier.

In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, most of the county was assigned to Romania, with one small part (villages of Banatska Subotica and Dobričevo) which was assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The north of the county (including Lugoj) is now part of the Romanian county of Timiș, except for a wide strip along the Mureș River, which is in Arad County. The rest now forms Caraș-Severin County, except for the city Orșova, which is in Mehedinți County.

<doc id="932034" wikidata="Q4731302" url="?curid=932034" title="Allegheny Front">
<text>The Allegheny Front is the major southeast- or east-facing escarpment in the Allegheny Mountains in southern Pennsylvania, western Maryland, eastern West Virginia, and western Virginia. The Allegheny Front forms the boundary between the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to its east and the Appalachian Plateau (locally called the Allegheny Plateau) to its west. The Front is closely associated with the Appalachian Mountains&#x27; Eastern Continental Divide, which in this area divides the waters of the Ohio/Mississippi river system, flowing to the Gulf of Mexico, from rivers flowing into Chesapeake Bay and from there into the Atlantic Ocean. 
The Allegheny Front and the Eastern Continental Divide do not always coincide; for example, the North Branch of the Potomac River begins well west of the Front, at the Fairfax Stone near the southwestern tip of Maryland, about and across the actual divide from the headwaters of the Youghiogheny River draining northwards into the Monongahela and Ohio rivers. The Front and the Divide diverge completely in central Pennsylvania where the West Branch Susquehanna River originates north of the Allegheny Front. 

The Allegheny Front is one of the windiest spots east of the Mississippi, leading to the recent establishment of wind farming there.

==Geography==
The Allegheny Front forms part of the Appalachian Structural Front, separating the Appalachian Plateau from the Appalachians&#x27; Ridge and Valley Province. The various other escarpments along this structural feature include the Catskill Escarpment to the northeast and the Cumberland Escarpment to the southwest. The Allegheny Front extends for about southwesterly from south-central Pennsylvania through western Maryland, then divides the eastern panhandle of West Virginia from the rest of that state.

The name &quot;Allegheny Front&quot; is applied to the escarpment throughout much of its extent, although it is little used in Maryland.

===Elevations===
The highest part of the crest of the Allegheny Front is also its southernmost high point, Mount Porte Crayon at , on the Pendleton/Randolph county line in West Virginia. Its lowest point, , is along the North Branch of the Potomac River near Keyser, West Virginia. Other high points along the front include the Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia, a broad, rocky plateau at an elevation of about ; Dan&#x27;s Rock on Dans Mountain in Maryland at ; and Blue Knob in northern Bedford County, Pennsylvania, with an elevation greater than .

===Eastern Continental Divide===
Local segments of the Eastern Continental Divide usually pass within a few miles of the Allegheny Front and in many places coincide with it; this divide between waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico separates the westward-flowing Ohio River watershed from the eastward-flowing watersheds of the Susquehanna, Potomac, and James rivers. Numerous eastward-flowing streams have their headwaters incised into Allegheny Front, displacing the divide westward from the front, including the North Branch of the Potomac River west of Cumberland, Maryland, which originates well into the Appalachian Plateau at the Fairfax Stone, just south of Maryland&#x27;s southwestern tip. No waterway crosses the front from east to west.

===Course===
The Allegheny Front begins in central Pennsylvania northwest of Lock Haven and extends southwest paralleling Bald Eagle Mountain and Brush Mountain to its east. The front continues to a point north of the Pennsylvania/Maryland boundary where it is offset about to the east as it changes from the bold escarpment that characterized it west of Altoona to its more gentle rise in Maryland.

Across the Mason–Dixon line in Maryland, the front becomes Dans Mountain, west of Cumberland, which reaches at Dan&#x27;s Rock. Along Maryland&#x27;s southern border, the North Branch of the Potomac River cuts down through the front at just west of Keyser, West Virginia.

South of the Potomac in West Virginia, the front continues through the Mount Storm area, then passes along the eastern edge of Dolly Sods, a wide plateau of Pottsville conglomerate bedrock at about elevation. From the Sods, the front continues southward as an increasingly steep escarpment west of the North Fork of the South Branch Potomac River, with the Roaring Plains West Wilderness continuing the high plateaus of the Dolly Sods area along the escarpment&#x27;s crest. The Allegheny Front&#x27;s southern end is Mount Porte Crayon (), after which the land drops steeply to Seneca Creek, west of Seneca Rocks.

===Escarpments===

South of Mount Porte Crayon and Seneca Creek, the Appalachian structural front is less clearly unified. Pottsville-capped Spruce Mountain, south and east of Seneca Creek, continues the Allegheny Front&#x27;s geology southward; this ridge reaches an elevation of at Spruce Knob, West Virginia&#x27;s highest point. Similarly steep escarpments sharing much of the same geologic structure are also present nearby along the eastern slopes of Allegheny Mountain and Back Allegheny Mountain (along with the southern end of Shavers Mountain), but these mountains lack the Pottsville caps characteristic of the Allegheny Front. Allegheny Mountain&#x27;s long, nearly level crest is generally about in elevation, with Paddy Knob reaching . High points on Back Allegheny Mountain and adjacent Shavers Mountain include Gaudineer Knob () and Bald Knob (); these two mountains form a part of the divide between the Monongahela River and New River portions of the Ohio River watershed.

==Geology==
Most of the Allegheny Front is capped by a nearly horizontal, erosion-resistant stratum (rock layer) of white Pottsville conglomerate, sometimes where flat with younger Carboniferous strata on top. The silica-cemented, gravel-containing Pottsville rock formed as part of a vast delta in the Pennsylvanian period.

The region was then uplifted and folded during the Alleghenian orogeny about 320-250 million years ago, during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, forming the modern Appalachian Mountains as the North American and African tectonic plates collided.

Subsequent erosion (for more than 200 million years) has preferentially removed various softer surrounding rocks, especially the easily dissolved Greenbrier limestone, leaving areas of the hard Pottsville conglomerate as a caprock protecting softer rock strata immediately beneath. The Pottsville outcrops conspicuously in various more exposed areas along the front&#x27;s eastern edge. Many of these clifftops offer broad scenic views, unlike most mountaintops within the generally forested Appalachians, and the more readily accessible are popular tourist destinations, including Dan&#x27;s Rock on Dans Mountain in Maryland and the Dolly Sods and an overlook along U.S. Route 50 in West Virginia.

Since the eastern side of the front is drained by Chesapeake Bay stream that drop fairly rapidly through the Ridge and Valley Province to the low-elevation waters of the Great Appalachian Valley, erosion on the eastern slope of this caprock layer has been much more intense than on the western slope, where drainage to low elevations is spread over a greater distance (particularly considering stream meanders) through the Appalachian Plateau to the Ohio River. These contrasting patterns of erosion produce a steep escarpment along much of the front&#x27;s eastern edge, with the mountains west of the front generally grading more gently into the Appalachian Plateau.

==Ecology==

The nearly continuous high elevation and clifftop bedrock exposures of the Allegheny Front provide an important corridor of upland habitat in the central Appalachian Mountains.

===Migratory bird flyway===
During the fall, the Allegheny Front is associated with an important flyway for migratory birds traveling from their northern breeding grounds to their southern wintering sites. In good weather, the birds can be seen from late morning, when they take advantage of the thermals (rising pockets of warm air) to facilitate flying, until the thermals cease in late afternoon.

Among the bird-banding stations and migratory bird observatories associated with this flyway are:
*Allegheny Front Hawk Watch on the border between Bedford and Somerset counties, Pennsylvania. On 20 September 2003, after the remnants of Hurricane Isabel passed western Pennsylvania, 833 hawks were counted passing the site. The Allegheny Front Hawk Watch set three Eastern Flyway Golden Eagle records during the 2015 migration. The first was counting 74 golden eagles on October 24, 2015. This helped propel the hawk site to a new fall record of 320 golden eagles being counted during the fall migration. This coupled with the 66 goldens counted in the spring of 2015, yielded a total of 386 migrating birds for the year. 
*Allegheny Front Migratory Observatory (Bird Banding Station) near the Red Creek Campground at Dolly Sods. The station is open from August to October in good weather. Established in 1958, it is the only cooperative banding station in West Virginia.

=== Dolly Sods Wilderness ===
In the Dolly Sods Wilderness of West Virginia, and southward toward Mount Porte Crayon, the front is topped for more than by a broad, nearly flat plateau with many wide areas of exposed bedrock along the edge of the escarpment&#x27;s drop to the North Fork River to the east, along the front&#x27;s base. Many of these windswept cliff-edge outcrops are sparsely vegetated, with occasional one-sided (flagged) red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;) trees, and open habitats dominated by various low-growing Appalachian and boreal plant species.

==Economic importance==

The long, steep, nearly continuous, often windswept escarpment of the Allegheny Front has both positive and negative effects on society and culture in the central Appalachians region.

===Challenge to transportation and communication===
Few roads or railroads cross the Allegheny Front, limiting transportation and communication between the regions to its east and west. Establishing passage of the front was key to the development of the U.S. railroad network during the second half of the 19th century, thereby connecting the Midwest by rail with the Atlantic seaboard. The Pennsylvania Railroad built the Horseshoe Curve track section west of Altoona, so that freight trains could ascend or descend to or from the Allegheny Plateau to the west.

===Recreation and tourism===
Substantial portions of the Allegheny Front&#x27;s crest and slopes are parts of a national forest (the Monongahela in West Virginia) or various state, local, or private wildlands parks or preserves. The few readily accessible scenic viewpoints atop the Allegheny Front are popular tourist destinations. The Skyline Overlook along U.S. Route 50 in West Virginia is readily accessible by a major road. The front is also a significant part of scenic views from various highways and mountains to its east, such as North Fork Mountain in West Virginia.

===Wind farming===
The NedPower Mount Storm Wind Project in West Virginia includes 132 wind turbines along of the Allegheny Front in Grant County near Mount Storm. Constructed between 2006 and 2008, it generates up to 264 megawatts of electricity for the mid-Atlantic power grid, enough to service about 66,000 homes and businesses.

In December 2016, Save Our Allegheny Ridges, a group that opposes energy development on forested mountaintops, said in a news release that Invenergy plans to install a series of wind turbines atop Shaffer Mountain in Somerset County just a few miles north of the Allegheny Front Hawk Watch.

<text>Aleksei Semyonovich Shein (; 1662 – February 12, 1700) was a Russian commander and statesman, the first Russian Generalissimo (1696), boyar, great-grandson of Mikhail Shein.

Shein originated from an old boyar family, which, however, after the execution of Mikhail Shein in 1634 was exiled to Alatyrsky Uyezd, currently Chuvashia, and were only allowed to return to Moscow in 1642.

As a boy, Shein attended the execution of Stepan Razin. Later in his life, he would participate in the coronation ceremony of Peter I and Ivan V. Sophia Alekseyevna was very fond of Shein and granted him the title of a boyar. Shein was a military commander in Tobolsk and Kursk in 1680–1684. Later, he was one of the military leaders during the Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689 and the Azov campaigns of 1695–1696. During the Second Azov campaign in 1696, Shein was the commander-in-chief of the Russian land forces and was granted the title of Generalissimus by Peter I for his military achievements. Upon his departure on the Grand Embassy mission (&quot;Великое посольство&quot;, or Velikoye posolstvo), Peter I appointed Shein commander-in-chief of the Russian Army and director of the Gunnery, Reiter and Foreign Affairs Departments. In 1697, Shein defeated the Crimean and Nogai Tatars. In 1698, Shein was the one to suppress the Streltsy Uprising. Upon Peter&#x27;s return, however, Shein fell into his disgrace for not having disclosed Streltsys’ ties with Sophia and, therefore, lost his boyar beard.

Stefan Yavorsky (later archbishop of Ryazan) performed the funeral oration for Shein, it attracted the attention of Peter the Great.

It is located between Switzerland (Canton of Valais) and Italy (Piedmont and Aosta Valley). The peak itself is located wholly in Switzerland.

Following a long series of attempts beginning in the early nineteenth century, Monte Rosa&#x27;s summit, then still called &quot;Höchste Spitze&quot; (), was first reached on 1 August, the Swiss National celebration day, in 1855 from Zermatt by a party of eight climbers led by three guides: Matthäus and Johannes Zumtaugwald, Ulrich Lauener, Christopher and James Smyth, Charles Hudson, John Birkbeck and Edward Stephenson.

== Naming ==
The peak is distinguished by the name &quot;Dufourspitze&quot; (in German, lit. &quot;Dufour Peak&quot;; , ). This replaced the former name &quot;Höchste Spitze&quot; () that was indicated on the Swiss maps before the Federal Council, on January 28, 1863, decided to rename the mountain in honor of Guillaume-Henri Dufour. Dufour was a Swiss engineer, topographer, co-founder of the Red Cross and army general who led the Sonderbund campaign. This decision followed the completion of the Dufour Map, a series of military topographical maps created under the command of Dufour.

The point just east of the Dufourspitze and only 2 metres lower, the Dunantspitze, was renamed in 2014 in honor of Henry Dunant, the main founder of the Red Cross.

== Elevation ==

The Dufourspitze of Monte Rosa is the most elevated point of Valais and Switzerland, although it is not the most prominent of the country, that distinction belonging to the Finsteraarhorn, nor the most isolated, that distinction belonging to Piz Bernina. The Swiss national map gives an elevation of for the summit, which is 4,441 metres above Lake Maggiore, Switzerland&#x27;s lowest point. The height difference between the summit and the plains of northern Italy, from where Monte Rosa is well visible, reaches over . Monte Rosa has a topographic prominence of , the Great St Bernard Pass being the lowest col between it and the culminating point of the Alps. A 2000 survey, involving universities and the offices of cartography of Italy and Switzerland and part of the TOWER project (Top of the World Elevations Remeasurement), was made in order to record a more precise elevation for Monte Rosa. The result was from the Italian side and from the Swiss side, with a margin of error of 0.1 m. Monte Rosa succeeded the Finsteraarhorn as the highest summit of Switzerland in 1815, when Valais joined the Swiss Confederation.

Though the Mediterranean can hardly be visible from the summit of Monte Rosa because of intervening mountains, the view to the south extends to the Apennines, the mountains of Corsica and the Maritime Alps. On the north side the view extends to the Jura and further to the Vosges, the Swiss Plateau being mostly hidden by the high range of the Bernese Alps.

== History ==
=== Early exploration ===
Monte Rosa could be seen from many places on the south side of the Alps and it had been mentioned in many travel diaries. At the end of the 15th century some outlines of the mountain may possibly have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci into the background of the Madonna of the Rocks or other pictures. Da Vinci explored the Italian side of the mountain and made some observations, though there is but scanty evidence that he had climbed even a minor summit in the neighbourhood. He was intrigued by the permanent snow lying on the mountain and the darkness of the sky above him, he wrote:

:&quot;The base of this mountain gives birth to the 4 rivers which flow in four different directions through the whole of Europe. And no mountain has its base at so great a height as this, which lifts itself above almost all the clouds; and snow seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer, when the clouds are highest. And this hail lies [unmelted] there, so that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling clouds, which does not happen more than twice in an age, an enormous mass of ice would be piled up there by the layers of hail, and in the middle of July I found it very considerable; and I saw the sky above me quite dark, and the sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the plains below, because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun.&quot;
At the end of the eighteenth century, the people of the Italian valleys believed that a lost valley existed, hidden away between the glaciers of the great chain. The discovery of the valley was due to Joseph Beck of Gressoney-Saint-Jean. He put together a party, including his brother Valentin, and the Gressoney mountain guides Sebastian Linty, Joseph Zumstein, Nicolas (Niklaus) Vincent, François Castel and Étienne Lisco. They set out on a Sunday of August 1778. They started from their sleeping places at midnight, and roped carefully. They had furnished themselves with climbing irons and alpenstocks. At the head of the glacier, they encountered a slope of rock devoid of snow, which they climbed.
:&quot;It was twelve o&#x27;clock. Hardly had we got to the summit of the rock than we saw a grand-an amazing-spectacle. We sat down to contemplate at our leisure the lost valley, which seemed to us to be entirely covered with glaciers. We examined it carefully, but could not satisfy ourselves that it was the unknown valley, seeing that none of us had ever been in the Vallais.&quot;

The valley, in fact, was none other than the upper valley of Zermatt, and the pass, which these early explorers had reached, was the Lysjoch, where, to this day, the rock on which they rested bears the name that they gave it, the &quot;Entdeckungsfels&quot; (German: &quot;Rock of Discovery&quot;). Beck&#x27;s party thus reached a height of 4,178 metres (13,707 ft), probably a record in the Alps at that times.

Count Morozzo of Turin was inspired by the view of Monte Rosa and in 1787 he tried to reach its summit from the east face. However he did not go very high, and the mountain looked much too inaccessible to encourage him to proceed further. He reached the place of the actual Marinelli hut, 1,500 m below the summit. The route on the east face was opened only in 1872. In 1789, following the recommendation of the Count, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure went to Macugnaga to explore the mountain. He climbed Pizzo Bianco, a 3215 m summit facing the mountain from the east and measured the altitude of Monte Rosa. He found a height of 2430 toises.

A first serious attempt was made in 1801 by a doctor of Alagna, Pietro Giordani. He reached alone a great height when climbing a 4,046 metres high point on the south-east ridge of the Vincent Pyramid, later named &quot;Giordanispétz&quot; or &quot;Punta Giordani&quot; in his honour. He arrived too late to proceed to the Vincent Pyramid summit and night drove him away. He had to sleep in a cleft of ice at about 14,000 feet. He wrote an account of his exploit: After an eloquent description of the view, he expresses his annoyance at the lack of scientific instruments, and the lateness of the hour which prevented him from ascending &quot;Monte Rosa&quot; itself.

The 4215 m Vincent Pyramid summit was eventually successfully climbed on 15 August 1819 by Johann Niklaus and Joseph Vincent from Gressoney, after whom the peak has been named. The brothers Vincent tried to reach the highest summit again the next year, together with Joseph Zumstein, and guides and porters. On August 1, 1820, they reached a 4,563 metres high secondary summit, later named &quot;Zumsteinspitze&quot;. The climb was dangerous, as the party had to traverse under threatening walls of ice; they also had great difficulties on descent, because the afternoon sun had melted the snow on the slopes. They used mules to carry their equipment as far as the snow-line. During the expedition they thought they had climbed the true highest peak, but when they reached the summit they found out it was only a subpeak of Monte Rosa. Zumstein was anxious to return later and reach the highest summit, but his desire did not materialize.

=== First ascents ===

The first approaches to the summit were made from the northern slopes over the Gorner glacier via the Silbersattel (4,510 m). This pass was first reached on August 12, 1847, by Matthias and Johann zum Taugwald (guides from Zermatt whose name is also written &quot;Zumtaugwald&quot;), Johann Brantschen and Joseph Moser guiding the French professors Victor Puisieux and Edouard Ordinaire. Precisely a year later (12 August 1848), Johann Madutz from Matt, Glarus, and Matthias Zumtaugwald guided the Swiss theologian :de:Melchior Ulrich to the pass for an ascent of the highest summit. Ulrich had to give up, but the guides proceeded to climb to what they thought to be the Eastern summit of the Dufourspitze (&quot;Ostspitze&quot;, since 2014 Dunantspitze, 4632 m) and established a new altitude record in Switzerland. The descent over the same route was so tricky that Madutz at places had to lower down Zum Taugwald by rope. Three years later, on 22 August 1851, Johann Zumtaugwald returned, with Peter Taugwalder and Peter Inderbinen and the Swiss botanist brothers Adolf and Hermann Schlagintweit to repeat this ascent. They did not dare to traverse to the western summit, which the Schlagintweits estimated to be 7 meters higher. In 1891, W.A.B. Coolidge analyzed these ascents and concluded that both parties had reached the 4,618 m Grenzgipfel instead, which is a mere 50 meters to the east of Ostspitze. He transferred the honor of first climbing the Ostgipfel to Ulrich Lauener from Lauterbrunnen and the brothers Christopher, Edmund and James G. Smyth from Great Yarmouth, who reached the Ostspitze on September 1, 1854, from the Silbersattel. Some sources have the Zumtaugwald brothers also among this party. Zumtaugwald brothers returned twice more to the East summit, Johann and Matthias 10 days later (11 Sep 1854) with Edward Shirley Kennedy and Benedict Leir, and Matthias and Stephan later again with Edward Levi Ames. On these five occasions they never tried the difficult traverse to the western summit, also because the summits were both mapped as 4,638 m high at the time. Partially with the technical difficulty (UIAA III) of the route from Silbersattel in mind, many consider the Madutz and Zumtaugwald ascent in 1849 the true first ascent of Monta Rosa.
The first ascent of the western summit finally took place on August 1, 1855, by the above guides Matthias and Johann zum Taugwald and Ulrich Lauener and two of the Smyth brothers (James Greenville and Christopher). They were joined by the English gentlemen John Birkbeck, Charles Hudson and Edward Stephenson. Deeming the approach from the east summit unfeasible, the guides devised a route over the junction of the Monte Rosa and Grenz glaciers and over the west ridge directly to the west summit. Not two weeks later, on 13 August 1855, Johann and his brother Peter zum Taugwald guided eight more people, including Johann Jakob Weilenmann, to the summit over the same route. The west ridge route immediately became very popular and is still the normal route to the Dufourspitze.

The Irish physicist John Tyndall was guided to the summit in a group led by Ulrich Lauener in August 1858, but returned the next day (or week?) to make the first solo ascent of Dufourspitze on 17 August 1858, which he described in his account, &quot;Glaciers of the Alps&quot;.
:&quot;After breakfast I poured what remained of my tea into a small glass bottle, an ordinary demi-bouteille in fact; the waiter then provided me with a ham sandwich, and, with my scrip thus frugally furnished, I thought the heights of Monte Rosa might be won...&quot;

After encountering a party of climbers guided by Lauener, Tyndall reached alone the summit:
:&quot;A world of clouds and mountains lay beneath me. Switzerland, with its pomp of summits, was clear and grand; Italy was also grand, but more than half obscured. Dark cumulus and dark crag vied in savagery, while at other places white snows and white clouds held equal rivalry. The scooped valleys of Monte Rosa itself were magnificent, all gleaming in the bright sunlight — tossed and torn at intervals, and sending from their rents and walls the magical blue of the ice.&quot;
Among mountain guides, the eastern wall had the reputation of being unconquerable. Ferdinand Imseng was convinced that the long snow couloir in the middle of the face could be ascended. He succeeded in convincing other climbers and, on 22 July 1872, Richard Pendlebury, William and Charles Taylor, Ferdinand Imseng, Gabriel Spechtenhauser and Giovanni Oberto began the ascent from Macugnaga. They were aware of the objective dangers of the wall but they decided to go as high as possible, without compromising their lives. After a bivouac on the actual Marinelli hut emplacement, they headed towards the Grenzsattel. Suddenly, when they arrived near the Grenzsattel, an avalanche started and rivers of snow began to flow everywhere around the climbers. They were able to reach the safe rocks of the Grenzgipfel just in time to save their lives. They finally reached the summit and descended to Riffelalp on the other side, concluding an 18-hour journey.

This ascent made Ferdinand Imseng a famous mountain guide. He lost his life in 1881 on the east wall during the third ascent with Damiano Marinelli and guide Battista Pedranzini. On 8 August, they were caught by an avalanche and brought 1,200 metres down. The accident was reported by a porter who survived. The couloir was then named &quot;Canalone Marinelli&quot;.

=== Other ascents ===
In 1889 Achille Ratti, who became later Pope Pius XI, made the first traverse from Macugnaga to Zermatt by the Zumsteinjoch. After climbing the Dufourspitze, he spent the night on the summit with his companions.

Visiting Zermatt in 1894, the young Winston Churchill insisted on an ascent of Monte Rosa rather than of the Matterhorn, not only because of its superior height but also because the guides&#x27; fee was substantially less.

More recently, on August 1 (which happens to be the Swiss National Day), 2005, the Swiss Minister of Treasure Joseph Deiss climbed the Dufourspitze. The expedition marked the 150th anniversary of the first ascent.

== Huts and climbing routes ==

The Monte Rosa Hut (2,883 m) is the only mountain hut in the massif owned by the Swiss Alpine Club. It is situated on the &quot;Plattje&quot;, a rocky island between the Gorner and Grenz glaciers. It is accessible from Rotenboden, a station on the Gornergratbahn line. The hut was inaugurated in 1894 and rebuilt in 1940. In 2009, a new high technology mountain hut was inaugurated. The five-story crystal-shaped building is designed to obtain 90 per cent of its power needs from the sun and will be used as a research station.

The other huts are owned by the Italian Alpine Club, among them the Regina Margherita Hut located at 4,559 metres on the Signalkuppe. Inaugurated in 1893 and replaced in 1979, it is still the highest construction in Europe, and includes a laboratory and observatory.

Other huts owned by the Italian Alpine Club are the Marinelli Hut (3,036 m), used for the ascent of the east face, and the Bivacco Città di Gallarate (3,960 m), located near the summit of the Jägerhorn.

=== Normal route ===
The normal route to the summit begins at the Monte Rosa Hut. The normal route is mainly a glacier itinerary on the west slopes of Monte Rosa (Monte Rosa Glacier), with the final rocky west ridge to the summit. Although the itinerary itself is not difficult, it requires physical endurance and good acclimatization.

=== Marinelli couloir ===
The route starts from the Marinelli Hut and follows the steep Marinelli couloir on the east face. It is a long and dangerous route and has to be ascended very early in the morning on cold days in order to decrease the risk of avalanches.

<text>The Ichthyophiidae are the family of Asiatic tailed caecilians or fish caecilians found in South and Southeast Asia as well as southernmost China.

They are primitive caecilians, lacking many of the derived characters found in the other families. For example, their mouths are not recessed underneath their heads, they possess tails, and they have numerous scales on their bodies. However, they have two sets of muscles for closing the jaw, a feature unique to caecilians, but absent in the related family Rhinatrematidae.

They lay their eggs in cavities in moist soil, where they hatch into larvae that seek out streams or underground seepages, before metamorphosing into adults. Some evidence indicates the females may protect their eggs until they hatch.

<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics, four fencing events were contested.

The 1908 Games were the first to lack a foil competition. Foil fencing, &quot;not being in the opinion of the organisers a form of sport which is improved by competition,&quot; was held only as a display. The 1908 Olympics did introduce team sabre and épée competitions. As in the 1904 edition, the London Games held no events for masters; all fencing was done by amateurs.

<text>County of Temes (Hungarian: &quot;Temes&quot;, Romanian: &quot;Timiș&quot;, Serbian: &quot;Тамиш&quot; or &quot;Tamiš&quot;, German: &quot;Temes&quot; or &quot;Temesch&quot;) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in southwestern Romania and northeastern Serbia. The capital of the county was Temesvár (Romanian: Timișoara, Serbian: Темишвар or Temišvar, German: Temeswar or Temeschwar), which also served as the kingdom&#x27;s capital between 1315–1323.

==Geography==

Temes county was located in the Banat region. It shared borders with the Kingdom of Serbia and the Hungarian counties of Torontál, Arad and Krassó-Szörény. The river Danube formed its southern border, and the river Mureș its northern border. The rivers Bega, Timiș, Bârzava and Caraș flowed through the county. Its area in 1910 was .

==History==

Temes County was formed in the 12th century, after the establishment of Hungarian rule in the region. It was named after the local Temes (Timiș) river. The principal center of the county was named &quot;Temesvár&quot; in the Hungarian language, meaning literally: Temes Castle. The territory was an important place in the power struggle between Samuel Aba and Peter Orseolo. In 1070, the Pechenegs, allying with the Byzantines, who tried to annex the territory, devastated it, before they were routed by Géza I. Michael Doukas VII sent a golden diadem, today part of the Holy Crown, recognizing Hungary&#x27;s territorial sovereignty. In the late 11th century, Cuman and Byzantine raids restarted, but were repelled by Ladislaus I, the &quot;knight-king&quot;. By the reign of Béla III, a substantial part of the territory was inhabited by Turks and Slavs due to constant raids and the decrease of the Hungarian population. The first mention of the county was in 1212. The area was taken by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century (following the 1552 Siege of Temesvár) and the county was abolished. Its territory was then included into the Ottoman Temeşvar Eyalet.

After the region was captured by the Habsburgs in 1716, the area was included into the so-called Banat of Temeswar, a Habsburg province with the administrative center in Temeswar. This province was abolished in 1778 and the county of Temes was restored (with significantly different borders than in medieval times) and incorporated into Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in 1779.

Between 1849 and 1860, the area of the county was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat, a separate Austrian crownland. After 1853, the county did not exist since the voivodeship was divided into districts. After the voivodeship was abolished in 1860, the area was again incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary and the county was recreated in January 1861. In 1876, when the administrative structure of the Kingdom of Hungary was changed, the borders of Temes County were modified to include parts of the territory of the former Banat Military Frontier (including Fehértemplom/Bela Crkva, formerly the seat of the so-called Illyrian Regiment).

In 1918, the county first became part of the newly proclaimed Banat Republic that lasted for only a few days. The region was taken by Serbian and French troops, and then divided in 1919 between the Kingdom of Romania and the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, as both of the powers claimed the entire territory of the Banat. The border arrangements were set by the Paris Peace Conference. A majority of the county was assigned to Romania, while the south-western third was assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929).

The Yugoslav part of the pre-1920 Temes County (the southern region) is part of the Serbian autonomous region of Vojvodina. The Romanian part is now part of Timiș County, except for a ~ wide strip along the Mureș River, which is in Arad County.

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Temes county were:

The towns of Vršac, Bela Crkva, and Kovin are now in Serbia; the other towns mentioned are now in Romania.

<text>Ichthyophis is a genus of caecilians (limbless amphibians, sometimes called the Asian caecilians) found in Southeast Asia, the southern Philippines, and the western Indo-Australian Archipelago.

In Sri Lanka, three species occur. All are found in almost all habitats, but are known to prefer moist ones. The most common is &quot;Ichthyophis glutinosus&quot;, which is found in almost all altitudes; the others are &quot;I. orthoplicatus&quot;, which is found in similar habitat to &quot;I. glutinosus&quot;, but will not be found in lowlands below above sea level; and &quot;I. pseudangularis&quot;, found in lowlands below ASL. A new species was recently discovered called &quot;Ichthyophis multicolor&quot;.

<doc id="932059" wikidata="Q264922" url="?curid=932059" title="Jingle">
<text>A jingle is a short song or tune used in advertising and for other commercial uses. Jingles are a form of sound branding. A jingle contains one or more hooks and meanings that explicitly promote the product or service being advertised, usually through the use of one or more advertising slogans. Ad buyers use jingles in radio and television commercials; they can also be used in non-advertising contexts to establish or maintain a brand image. Many jingles are also created using snippets of popular songs, in which lyrics are modified to appropriately advertise the product or service.

==History==

The first radio commercial jingle aired in December 1926, for Wheaties cereal.

The Wheaties advertisement, with its lyrical hooks, was seen by its owners as extremely successful. According to one account, General Mills had seriously planned to end production of Wheaties in 1929 on the basis of poor sales. Soon after the song &quot;Have you tried Wheaties?&quot; aired in Minnesota, however, sales spiked there. Of the 53,000 cases of Wheaties breakfast cereal sold, 40,000 were sold in the Twin Cities market. After advertising manager Samuel Chester Gale pointed out that this was the only location where &quot;Have You Tried Wheaties?&quot; was being aired at the time, the success of the jingle was accepted by the company. Encouraged by the results of this new method of advertising, General Mills changed its brand strategy. Instead of dropping the cereal, it purchased nationwide commercial time for the advertisement. The resultant climb in sales single-handedly established the &quot;Wheaties&quot; brand nationwide.
After General Mills&#x27; success, other companies began to investigate this new method of advertisement. Initially, the jingle circumvented the ban on direct advertising that the National Broadcasting Company, the dominant broadcasting chain, was trying to maintain at the time. A jingle could get a brand&#x27;s name embedded in the heads of potential customers even though it did not fit into the definition of &quot;advertisement&quot; accepted in the late 1920s.

The art of the jingle reached its peak around the economic boom of the 1950s.
The jingle was used in the advertising of branded products such as breakfast cereals, candy, snacks, soda pop, tobacco, and beer. Various franchises and products aimed at the consumers&#x27; self-image, such as automobiles, personal hygiene products (including deodorants, mouthwash, shampoo, and toothpaste), and household cleaning products, especially detergent, also used jingles.

===Jingle downturn=== 
In August 2016, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; reported that in the United States, the once popular jingle was now being replaced by advertisers with a mixture of older and recent pop music to make their commercials memorable. In 1998, there were 153 jingles in a sample of 1,279 national commercials; by 2011, the number of jingles had dropped to eight jingles out of 306 commercials.

==Long running jingles==
One of the longest running jingles is for McCormick Foods&#x27; Aeroplane Jelly. Composed in Australia before 1943, the jingle has been used in advertising well into the 21st century. During the &#x27;40s, it made itself famous, or infamous, as it was played more than 100 times a day on some stations.

Another long-running jingle is &quot;Like a Good Neighbor, State Farm is There&quot;, which was composed by Barry Manilow and has been used in one form or another in commercials for State Farm Insurance since 1971.

The 6-note ABS-CBN jingle, used from 1967 to September 23, 1972 and since its reopening on September 14, 1986, serves as the network&#x27;s jingle as it is used on various IDs, such as Christmas and Summer station IDs.

==Alternative jingles==
Jingles can also be used for parody purposes, popularized in Top 40/CHR radio formats, primarily Hot30 Countdown, and used primarily for branding reasons.

Television station idents have also introduced their own audio jingles to strengthen their brand identities, for example the melodic motifs of Channel 4&#x27;s Fourscore or BBC One&#x27;s &#x27;Circle&#x27; idents.

==Radio jingles==
Most often the term &quot;radio jingles&quot; can be used to collectively describe all elements of radio station branding or identification. Accurately the term in the context of radio is used to describe only those station branding elements which are musical, or sung. Sung jingles are the most common form of radio station branding otherwise known as imaging. A radio jingle therefore is created in a studio by session singers and includes a musical representation of the radio station name and frequency. Radio stations will sub contract to specialist radio jingle producers who will create the musical sound and melody, along with recording the session singers. The elements, termed a &quot;donut&quot;, will then be dispatched to the radio station in various time variations to be edited by local radio producers before being broadcast between songs, or into and out of commercial breaks. Alternatively, jingles can be made in-house by production staff.

==Copyright==
When commissioned to write jingles, writers will sometimes create all aspects of the jingle: music, lyrics, performance and recording. In this case, the writer may be paid for these aspects as well as a flat fee. Although the advertiser receives rights free of writer royalty, sometimes the writer will try to retain performance rights. In most cases the writer retains no rights whatsoever. In other cases, advertisers purchase jingles in package deals from producers specializing in jingles. The writers working for these producers receive a salary and do not retain rights. The rights belong to the producer, who may sell them to an advertiser.

<doc id="932066" wikidata="Q2130946" url="?curid=932066" title="Horizon Records">
<text>Horizon Records was an American independent record label founded in 1962 by Dave Hubert.

Horizon was originally a folk and blues label distributed by World Pacific Records. When Liberty Records acquired World Pacific in 1965, it also took over the distribution of Horizon. From 1974 to 1978 the label became a subsidiary imprint of A&amp;M Records for issuing jazz. and pop, During this period, the label was known for producing albums with high-quality audio and packaging. The catalogue includes albums by Dave Brubeck, Ornette Coleman, Paul Desmond, Charlie Haden, and Jim Hall. John Snyder, the founder of the label, left in 1977 and started Artists House.

In 1979 Horizon struck gold with debut albums by Brenda Russell and the Yellow Magic Orchestra. By 1980, the label disappeared. In 1984, A&amp;M went into a deal with Word Distribution, giving more powerful distribution for Word&#x27;s labels, such as Myrrh Records, Word Records, and Exit Records. Horizon was reactivated with its 1979 artwork intact as a Christian label, with the Imperials, while Myrrh artist Amy Grant signed directly with A&amp;M. By 1987, Horizon had disappeared a second time. Horizon&#x27;s jazz catalogue is now managed by Verve Records.

<doc id="932068" wikidata="Q220017" url="?curid=932068" title="Jacob of Nisibis">
<text>Saint Jacob of Nisibis (, &#x27;; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἅγιος Ἰάκωβος Ἐπίσκοπος Μυγδονίας; [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: ), also known asSaint Jacob of Mygdonia,Saint Jacob the Great, andSaint James of Nisibis, was a hermit, a grazer and the Bishop of Nisibis until his death.

He was lauded as the &quot;Moses of Mesopotamia&quot;, and was the spiritual father of the renowned writer and theologian Saint Ephrem the Syrian. Saint Jacob was present at the first ecumenical council at Nicaea, and is venerated as a saint by the Church of the East, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Eastern Catholic Churches.

==Biography==

Saint Jacob was the son of prince Gefal, and was born in the city of Nisibis in Mesopotamia in the 3rd century AD. It is claimed that he was a relative of Saint Gregory the Illuminator. Saint Jacob became a Confessor of the Faith for his suffering during persecution by Emperor Maximian. Saint Jacob became an anchorite in c. 280 in the mountains near Nisibis where, according to Saint Theodoret of Cyrrhus, he survived on herbs and fruits, and chose to wear no clothes, build shelter, or light fires for warmth. The saint became famous, and received visits from Sheria, Bishop of Arbela (r. 304–316), according to the &quot;Chronicle of Arbela&quot;.

The saint resolved to climb Mount Qardu, traditionally believed to be the resting place of Noah&#x27;s Ark, and recover a fragment of the ark upon hearing from the hermit Maroukeh that local people doubted the Great Flood. Saint Jacob ascended the mountain and rested close to the summit; in his sleep, an angel placed a fragment of the ark close to him, and instructed him to awake. The saint brought the relic to the hermit Maroukeh and, according to the saint&#x27;s hagiography, a sacred spring appeared where the saint had rested, reputed to have healing properties.

A number of miracles are credited to Saint Jacob by Saint Theodoret in &quot;Historia Religiosa&quot; (Religious History), in which the saint had a boulder explode beside a Persian judge who had given an unjust judgement. Also, in one incident, Saint Jacob cursed boastful, promiscuous women by a spring so that their hair became white, and the spring disappeared. The women subsequently repented, and the spring returned, however, the women&#x27;s hair remained white. As well as this, a group of people attempted to deceive the saint whereby they asked for money to fund the burial of a man they had lain down and covered with a sheet with the illusion of death; consequently, the man died, and the people repented and thus the man was resurrected as a result of Saint Jacob&#x27;s prayers.

Disagreement exists as to the date of the saint&#x27;s consecration as bishop of Nisibis as it is argued it took place in c. 300, and he is recorded as the city&#x27;s first bishop by Saint Ephrem the Syrian. However, Saint Jacob is credited as the successor of Babu, the first bishop of Nisibis (r. 300–309), by the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, who Saint Ephrem states was in fact Saint Jacob&#x27;s successor. In his &quot;Chronography&quot;, Elijah of Nisibis states that Saint Jacob was consecrated bishop in 308.

The &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot; states that the saint constructed the first church in Nisibis in c. 313–320. Miles, Bishop of Susa, is said to have contributed a large quantity of silk from Adiabene to the church&#x27;s construction. The foundation of the School of Nisibis is also attributed to Saint Jacob. Saint Jacob attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and opposed Arius. Saint Ephrem purportedly accompanied the saint to the council, however, this is considered apocryphal. Saint Jacob attended the funeral of Saint Metrophanes of Byzantium in 326.

Saint Jacob was present at the siege of Nisibis by Shapur II, &quot;Shahanshah&quot; of Iran, in 337/338, and according to Saint Theodoret, with encouragement from the city&#x27;s population and Saint Ephrem, Saint Jacob ascended the walls and prayed for the city, and cursed the besiegers. The &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot; relates that he died on 15 July, the thirtieth day of the siege, according to the &quot;Chronicle of 724&quot;. Gennadius and Saint Ephrem record that Saint Jacob was buried within the walls of Nisibis. Saint Theodoret adds that the Iranian army was afflicted by a swarm of gnats and flies summoned by the saint, and Shapur II subsequently abandoned the siege.

The saint is counted amongst the signatories of the Council of Antioch in 341, however, his presence at the council is unrecorded in other sources. In 350, according to the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, Saint Jacob helped defend Nisibis against Shapur II again, and as he was wearing the imperial regalia, was confused for Emperor Constantius II. Shapur II challenged the saint to fight outside the city, where it was revealed he was an apparition and the Iranian army withdrew as a result.

==Relics==
The Tomb of Saint Jacob of Nisibis located at the newly excavated Church of Saint Jacob of Nisibis.

The fragment of Noah&#x27;s Ark discovered by Saint Jacob was later brought to Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Armenia.

Saint Theodoret relates that the bones of Saint Jacob were transferred from Nisibis to Edessa following the city&#x27;s cession to Iran on 22 August 363. The saint&#x27;s relics were later moved to Constantinople in 970, according to the Menologion of the Armenians at Venice.

Fragments of the skull of Saint Jacob were donated to Hildesheim Cathedral in Germany in 1367 by Lippold von Steinberg after the Battle of Dinklar (:de:Schlacht von Dinklar).

In 2018, relics of Saint Jacob were brought from the Armenian Church of Saint George in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, to Canada, where they were taken to the Armenian Church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator in Montreal on 17 June, and the Armenian Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto on 24 June.

==Works==

Several homilies previously attributed to Saint Jacob by Gennadius of Massilia and others are now understood to be the work of Saint Aphraates. The misidentification arose from Aphraates&#x27; assumption of the name Jacob upon becoming bishop. Letters and canons, as well as other works, formerly attributed to the saint are known to be written in a later period.

<doc id="932073" wikidata="Q602942" url="?curid=932073" title="Sunshine 60">
<text>is a 60-story, mixed-use skyscraper located in Ikebukuro, Toshima, Tokyo, adjoining the Sunshine City complex. At the time of its completion in 1978, the 239.7 m (786 ft) building was the tallest in Asia, a title it held until 1985 when it was surpassed by the 63 Building in Seoul. Sunshine 60 was also the tallest building in Tokyo and Japan until the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building was completed in 1991, and housed the world&#x27;s fastest elevators (at ) until the opening of the Yokohama Landmark Tower in 1993; Mitsubishi Electric installed the elevators at the former&#x27;s highest-rise bank as well as the latter, and Mitsubishi Estate owns both buildings.

==Construction==
Sunshine 60&#x27;s foundation is made of reinforced concrete. The lower segment of the building is also reinforced concrete with a steel skeleton. The upper tower is a steel skeleton with &quot;slitted shear walls&quot;. These unique walls were inserted between columns in the core, allowing the walls to conform to deformations in the steel frame caused by earthquakes and wind shear helping to assure structural integrity. A rigid framing structural system creates the frame. Mechanical equipment is located directly above the core of the structure on its rooftop.

Sunshine 60 was erected over the site of the destroyed Sugamo Prison, famously used to hold senior Japanese war criminals during the occupation. On December 23, 1948, seven high-ranking, convicted war criminals (including former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo) were hanged at the prison. It was also the site of the hanging of Soviet spy Richard Sorge during the war. In popular modern lore, the area is rumored to be haunted.

==Facilities==
As a mixed-use high-rise, Sunshine 60&#x27;s space is used for a variety of purposes. Floors 1 through 9 are used as commercial space and house a post office, banks, showrooms, cafeterias, a health care center and a day care center. Office space occupies floors 10 through 57. Restaurants are located on the 58th and 59th floors.

From the 60th floor, visitors can see as far as 100 km on a clear day from Sunshine 60&#x27;s observation deck (admission fee up to ¥620). To get visitors to the observation deck quickly, the observation deck bank of the tower&#x27;s 40 elevators takes passengers directly from the lobby at a speed of 600 meters per minute (36 km/h, 22 mph). Between its opening and 1993 (the opening of Yokohama Landmark Tower), the observation deck elevators were the fastest in the world.

===Office tenants===
The office floors house the headquarters of Credit Saison, FamilyMart, NTT Plala and Sammy Corporation, among other office tenants.
