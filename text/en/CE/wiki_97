<text>Brunei–Muara District (; Jawi: دايره بروني موارا), or simply known as Brunei–Muara (&quot;&quot;), is the smallest as well as the most populated district in Brunei. It has an area of and the population of 318,530 as of 2021. The district is also home to its administrative centre is Bandar Seri Begawan, as well as the Brunei International Airport and Muara Port, the country&#x27;s only international airport and deep-water port respectively. The Brunei River flows within this district and is home to Kampong Ayer. As the administrative center of Brunei is located in the district, it remains the most developed in the country with the most up-to-date infrastructure, despite not being the center of Brunei&#x27;s main economic activity.

== Geography ==
Brunei–Muara District is bordered to the west by the Tutong District, to the south by Sarawak, Malaysia, and to the east by Brunei Bay, with Temburong District to the southeast and Sabah, Malaysia, to the east. The district&#x27;s northern boundary is the South China Sea. The Brunei River flows through the district, emptying into Brunei Bay. The area is characterised by a coastal plain interspersed with low hills, with the capital city, Bandar Seri Begawan, situated on the northern bank of the river&#x27;s estuary. Bukit Buang Sakar, the district&#x27;s highest point, stands at . The Muara Port, is located at the tip of a peninsula extending northeast to the Pelumpong Island.

A prominent feature of Brunei–Muara is the Pelumpong Island, which extends eastward from Tanjung Batu on the mainland and then east-northeast to Pelumpong Island. A waterway was created halfway along the spit to improve access to Muara Port, with breakwaters extending seawards for protection. Brunei&#x27;s land includes a narrow coastal strip between Kuala Belait and Lumut, where rivers and streams flow directly into the sea, and a larger area in Brunei–Muara, where streams drain into the Brunei River and eventually reach Brunei Bay. Eastward in the bay is the island of Pulau Muara Besar. North of the bay is Serasa Bay, encircled by the 1.6 kilometre long Serasa Spit, an artificial sandbar made from dredged sands, including those from the Pelumpong Island. The bay is fed by two rivers, Sungai Mangsalut and Sungai Mengkabau, and is surrounded by Brunei&#x27;s mangrove forests, which cover 18,418 hectares, representing 3.2% of the country’s total land area. Brunei Bay features extensive coastal swamplands totalling 44,290 hectares, including 31,160 hectares of mangroves and 13,128 hectares of &quot;nipah&quot;, with a coastline that stretches 194.73 kilometres.

Situated in Brunei–Muara, the Sengkurong region spans 100 hectares of level terrain encircled by steep hills, with a coastline front of approximately 1 kilometer and an inland extension of 2 kilometers. This area&#x27;s alluvial soil is ideal for all kinds of agriculture since it is poorly drained and was mostly created as river levees without any acid sulfate threat. The Jerudong Cattle Fattening Station and the Luahan Cattle Breeding Station are currently the most utilised cattle farm. Generally having firm upper soils that soften in deeper layers, the flat alluvial floodplains of the district can be economically developed into recreational fields, roads, parking lots, and single-story buildings; the alluvio-marine mangrove and nipah swamps that dominate Brunei Bay&#x27;s coastal areas can also be used for these purposes.

== History ==
The administrative center of the Bruneian Empire was originally located near Kampong Ayer in the Brunei–Muara District. Notably in 1837, this district was the centre of the coal industry, which was first mined in Brooketon Colliery. Over time, Brunei&#x27;s territory significantly diminished, particularly with the cession of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 and other concessions to the British North Borneo Company. In 1906, the introduction of the British Residency brought changes to the administrative structure, with European officials advising the Sultan and overseeing key departments. The government was centralised in Brunei Town, with Malay District Officers (DO) reporting to the British Resident in all four districts. In 1908, the administrative districts of Brunei and Limau Manis were merged.

Brunei–Muara, being the administrative centre, was a focal point for the British Resident&#x27;s development efforts, particularly until 1932 when the rise of the oil industry began to shift attention to other districts. Nevertheless, the district remained the primary center for government operations and continued to receive significant focus. The present day Brunei–Muara District was formed in 1938 with the merger of the then Brunei and Limau Manis, and Muara administrative districts. By 1947, Brunei&#x27;s territory had been reduced to around 2,226 square miles with an estimated population of 40,670. The key remaining districts were Belait, Tutong, Temburong and Brunei–Muara.

== Administration ==

The borders of the Bandar Seri Begawan Municipal Board territory are defined by the Bandar Seri Begawan Municipal Board (borders of Municipal Board territory) Declaration, 2008, which came into effect on 1 August 2007, and are listed in the schedule. In addition, it states that areas that were previously subject to development control will no longer be so as of the declaration&#x27;s effective date, and that any applications and enforcement actions that are still ongoing under earlier acts would proceed as though the declaration had never been issued. Additionally, the previous Brunei Town (Municipal Board Area) Notification, 1956 is repealed, and the Minister of Development is empowered to handle any problems that may arise from putting these changes into effect.

The procedures for the board&#x27;s business conduct are outlined in the Bandar Seri Begawan Municipal Board (Standing Orders) By-Laws, 2018. Meeting procedures, such as notification requirements, quorum requirements, and the responsibilities of the chairman and secretary, are outlined in the bylaws. Members must adhere to certain voting and speaking procedures, and meetings must begin with a prayer. The chairman is in charge of the meeting, and every motion needs to be submitted in writing and seconded before it can be discussed. These bylaws guarantee the Municipal Board&#x27;s organised and orderly governance.

The district is administered by the Brunei–Muara District Office (), a government department under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The district is subdivided into 18 mukims, namely:

These are further subdivided into 83 Kampongs (Villages).

According to the Constitution, the district is to be represented in the Legislative Council, the state legislature, by up to 7 members. As of 2023, five members have been appointed to represent the district in the legislature.

In 2020 the district&#x27;s population was estimated to have increased to 316,100.

==Transportation==
===Road===

According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2008/2009, which rated Brunei 28th out of 134 developing economies, 7th in Asia, and 3rd in Southeast Asia, the country has excellent road infrastructure. Through the National Development Plan (RKN) 2007–2012, which allots over $600 million for highway projects, road building, paving, maintenance, and resurfacing, the government supports this. When state, district, and Royal Brunei Armed Forces roadways are included, the total length of roads in Brunei was in 2008. The Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Highway, the Muara–Tutong Highway, the widening of Jalan Kebangsaan Baru, and the newly constructed roads like the Jerudong Tungku Link and Tanah Jambu Link roads in the district. Additionally, the Public Works Department intends to build flyovers at the intersections of Jalan Pengiran Babu Raja, Jalan Tutong, the Muara–Tutong Highway, and Jalan Berakas Link Junction. As of 2022, the district&#x27;s road network consisted of , out of which were paved. 

===Rail===
Brooketon Colliery, located in Mukim Serasa, operated a 2.5 km narrow gauge railway with a 711 mm gauge from the colliery to the deepwater harbour at Muara. The railway used wooden rails initially, later replaced with steel rails, and was serviced by two 0-4-0 steam locomotives built by Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co. for leasing to Sir Charles Brooke. The first locomotive, named Marguerite Reine, was built in 1891, and the second, Brooketon, in 1897. The colliery transported approximately 650,000 tons of coal between 1888 and 1924, largely for the market in Labuan. The site was deemed unprofitable and decommissioned in 1924. Today, remnants of the railway and locomotives are protected under Brunei&#x27;s Antiquities and Treasure Trove Act, with plans to exhibit them in an open-air museum to promote eco-tourism.

===Water===

The principal port and a vital trade gateway, Muara Port is situated in Brunei–Muara and is about 27 km from the city centre. It handles the majority of the nation&#x27;s imports and exports. The Muara Container Terminal effectively handles all containerized freight since it is run by knowledgeable staff and has state-of-the-art equipment. Muara Port is ideally situated to meet both present demands and future expansion, especially in the East ASEAN Growth Area and the BIMP-EAGA. It can handle between 220,000 and 330,000 TEU cargo. Furthermore, because of its strategic location along the East–West maritime trade route and appropriateness for big container ships, Pulau Muara Besar, which spans 955 hectares in Brunei Bay, has been considered as the perfect site for a deep-sea container port. The Royal Brunei Navy&#x27;s Muara Naval Base and the Serasa Ferry Terminal are two other establishments in Mukim Serasa.

===Air===
The national airline of Brunei, Royal Brunei Airlines (RBA), was founded on 18 November 1974, and is fully controlled by the government. In addition to code-sharing arrangements with a number of foreign airlines, such as Thai Airways International, Malaysia Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, the airline provides scheduled routes across Asia, the Middle East, Australasia, and the United Kingdom, enabling smooth travel to a number of locations. Brunei International Airport (BIA), which is situated in Brunei–Muara and has been in operation since 1974. It is a well-equipped service center with shops, dining options, and communication hubs.

==Economy==
=== Agriculture ===

Brunei has prioritised the agriculture sector, which has tremendous development potential, in its attempts to diversify the economy. Driven by crops, cattle, and agrifood processing, the agricultural sector&#x27;s gross production reached over B$200 million by 2008, nearly double the $113.02 million recorded in 1999. By 2013, agrifood sales are expected to reach B$340 million, a 512% rise from B$52.53 million in 2008. In 2009, the rice industry made significant strides with the harvest of &#x27;Beras Laila,&#x27; which improved food security due to its high protein content and capacity to be grown twice a year. 26 agricultural development zones totaling 2,788.69 hectares are located in the district, with five of them (Batong, Bebuloh, Junjongan, Panchor Murai, and Wasan) designated for paddy agriculture.

The 2022 Agricultural Development Areas (KKP) in the district encompass 4,177.99 hectares, of which 1,799.13 hectares are designated for farmers and 1,159.95 hectares are utilised for stations and other uses. Important locations include KKP Terunjing for veterinary services, KKP Limpaki for various agricultural operations, KKP HBC Rimba for agriculture and floriculture, and KKP Mulaut for paddy and vegetables. KKP Sibongkok for vegetables and paddy, KKP Betumpu for livestock and a variety of crops, and KKP Sungai Tajau A for broilers are other noteworthy locations. A total of 251.45 hectares make up the Rural Agricultural Areas (RAA), of which 182.45 hectares are allotted to farmers for the production of fruits and 10 hectares are set aside for other purposes. KPLB Kulapis, KPLB Masin A, KPLB Pengkalan Batu, KPLB Tempayan Pisang, and KPLB Bukit Pawas are among the regions.

=== Oil and gas ===

Situated in 30 meters of water 70 kilometres northeast of Seria, the Champion oil field is the most productive in Brunei, accounting for 40% of the nation&#x27;s known reserves and yielding over 100,000 barrels daily. The field comprises the Champion-7 core complex, which houses around 160 workers and has about 260 wells drilled from 40 platforms. It also has facilities for gaslift, compression, and water injection. The seventh field of the Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) began operations in January 1992 at Iron Duke oil field, 13 kilometres southwest of Champion. Since Gannet gas field in 1988, this was the first new field to begin production. Three wells that are connected to Champion via the multiphase pipeline of the business provide the production.

=== Petrochemical ===
In 2020, the Brunei–China joint venture Hengyi Industries generated US$3.5 billion in revenue from its oil refinery and petrochemical plant on Pulau Muara Besar, significantly impacting Bruneian economy. Hengyi&#x27;s operations contributed 4.48% to Brunei&#x27;s GDP and 50.57% to the country&#x27;s total trade volume from January to September 2020. The company also accounted for 44.6% of Brunei&#x27;s exports and 59.27% of imports during this period. Hengyi’s output played a key role in boosting the nation&#x27;s downstream sector despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant advancements toward the Wawasan Brunei 2035 economic goals. Additionally, Hengyi supplied 283,000 tonnes of fuel for the local market and is investing B$13.65 billion to expand its operations, increasing its refining capacity and downstream production.

=== Agrifood ===
526.02 hectares are allotted to livestock land in 2022; of this, 175.45 hectares are for broilers, 76.12 hectares are for layers, 16.50 hectares are for day-old chicks, and 16.50 hectares are for fertilised eggs. In addition, there are many categories such as 2.00 hectares for cattle and buffalo, 69.40 hectares for goats, 69.40 hectares for sheep, and 7.70 hectares for livestock feed. Nine deer and a variety of non-ruminant animals, including 80,686 village fowl, 1,833 muscovy ducks, 2,897 ducks, 71,082 quails, 213,071 old layer hens, and 43,189 chicken breeders, are among the livestock produced. In addition, a total of 741,034 eggs were produced in the area, including 101,181 village fowl eggs, 348 goose eggs, 5,326 muscovy duck eggs, 288,538 duck eggs, and 345,641 quail eggs.

=== Fisheries ===

For Brunei&#x27;s population in 1992, which eats over of animal protein per capita annually, much more than any other country in Southeast Asia, inshore fisheries constitute an essential source of this protein. In Brunei, traditional inshore fishing has a long history, with the majority of activity taking place in Brunei–Muara. In addition to 1,190 outboard fishing boats, the district had 659 licensed full-time and 1,566 part-time fishermen in 1986. 71.3% of the full-time fisherman called the district home. Despite the fact that there are two to three times as many part-time fisherman as full-timers, their catches have not been as well tracked, which emphasises the need for more precise statistics on their contributions. 408 tons of marine fish and 83 tons of freshwater fish are estimated to be consumed for subsistence by the Department of Fisheries.

== Development ==

Seven health centers offering almost free medical care have been constructed by the government as part of a comprehensive healthcare system. The Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital, a referral hospital, and the Jerudong Park Medical Centre (JPMC), a private hospital, are two of the major facilities. Gleneagles JPMC, which is well-known for its specialty cardiac care, is also located in Jerudong. In line with Wawasan Brunei 2035, Brunei prioritises free, high-quality education under the SPN21 educational system. Along with several private and religious schools that serve a range of educational requirements, the area is home to 64 government elementary schools, 23 secondary schools, and several higher education institutions, including Sultan Sharif Ali Islamic University, Seri Begawan Religious Teachers University College, Universiti Brunei Darussalam and Universiti Teknologi Brunei.

The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, and several more ministries concentrating on different areas including development, health, and education are important government departments. Beginning with the first resettlement initiatives in the 1950s, which moved people from Kampung Ayer and other regions to new locations like Bunut and Berakas, the government has a long history of providing housing options created by the National Housing Programme. Housing estates had been constructed by the 1960s, and the RPN Lambak Kanan had been founded in the 1970s. Since then, a number of housing initiatives have been unveiled, such as the Temporary Occupation-of-Land License (TOL) and the Landless Indigenous Citizens&#x27; Housing Scheme (STKRJ). To accommodate the expanding demands of the population, the RKN 2007-2012 specifies new housing developments in places like Kampong Salambigar and Kampong Rimba.

99.9% of Bruneians have access to clean piped water at the conclusion of the RKN 8, up from 99.7% at the end of the RKN 7. Along with several service reservoirs in high-density areas like Kampong Rimba, Kampong Lumapas, and Kampong Kilanas, two terminal reservoirs in Brunei–Muara at Kiarong and Lambak Kanan were built to enhance water delivery. In order to address the rising demand for water, the RKN 2007–2012 includes additional projects including the construction of new reservoirs at Terunjing and Berakas and the installation of new main pipelines. Four power plants are under the management of the Department of Electrical Services, while three more plants are run by Berakas Power Company. There are continuing initiatives to combine Brunei&#x27;s three separate electrical networks and investigate alternate energy sources. The electrical system in the nation is 220–240V British standard; anything that requires 110V requires a converter.

<text>Dennis Heeney (March 22, 1933 – November 15, 2005) was a Manitoba politician. In the provincial elections of 1986 and 1988, he was the leader of the province&#x27;s Confederation of Regions Party, a group that opposed the extension of French-language rights and sought greater autonomy for western Canada (unlike the Western Canada Concept and Western Independence Party, it did not seek full independence for the western provinces).

Heeney was serving as the reeve of the Rural Municipality of Elton in 1983 when he became active in a provincial controversy over the entrenchment of francophone services. At the time, NDP Premier Howard Pawley was attempting to reintroduce French-language services into the province&#x27;s parliament and legal system. Heeney spoke out against the initiative at a public meeting in Brandon, claiming that it would effectively amount to granting special privileges for only 6% of Manitoba&#x27;s population. Heeney subsequently became involved in Manitoba Grassroots, an anti-bilingualism coalition led by renegade NDP backbencher Russell Doern. In February 1984, he led a protest outside a Brandon NDP convention.

Later in the year, Heeney ran as a candidate for the national Confederation of Regions Party in the federal riding of Brandon-Souris. He received 6322 votes, finishing second to Progressive Conservative candidate Lee Clark (who received 18,813 votes).

A provincial CoR party was also founded in 1984, and Heeney replaced Douglas Edmondson as its leader shortly thereafter. The party ran fifteen candidates in the provincial election of 1986, placing second in four rural, anglophone ridings. Heeney, running in the riding of Minnedosa, received 1508 votes for a third-place finish.

Although this result was fairly respectable for a newly formed party, it disappointed many CoR supporters who hoped that at least a few of their candidates would be elected. The party declined in status, and became marginalized after the bilingualism controversy died down.

Heeney continued to lead the party into the election of 1988. The Manitoba CoR fielded fourteen candidates, although none came close to being elected. Heeney, running again in Minnedosa, received 820 votes for a fourth-place finish.

Heeney appears to have resigned as Manitoba CoR leader soon after the election. He returned to municipal politics, and served as reeve of Elton from 1978 to 2001.

<doc id="935705" wikidata="Q5354616" url="?curid=935705" title="Elections in Antigua and Barbuda">
<text>Elections in Antigua and Barbuda take place in the framework of a parliamentary democracy.

==Electoral system==
Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s electoral law was passed on 31 October 1975 and was last amended in 2002. Elections are overseen by the Office of the Supervisor of Elections and an Electoral Commission, which was established in 2002. The latter consists of five members appointed by the Governor-General; three (including the chair) on the advice of the Prime Minister and two on the advice of the leader of the opposition.

===House of Representatives===
The House of Representatives has 17 elected members and two unelected members, the Attorney General and the Speaker. Elections for the House are held every five years, although early elections can take place if Parliament is dissolved by the Prime Minister. By-elections must take place within 120 days of a member vacating their seat.

Members are elected via a plurality in single-member constituencies. Voters must be aged 18 or over, be citizens of the country or citizens of a Commonwealth country who has lived in the country for at least three years prior to a qualifying date, and have been resident in the constituency for at least a month prior to the qualifying date.

Candidates must be at least 21 years old, citizens of the country, and have lived in the country for at least a year prior to the elections. They must also have the ability to speak and (unless blind) be able to read English with &quot;sufficient proficiency&quot;. Those with dual citizenship or an undischarged bankruptcy are ineligible, as are those who have been imprisoned for more than a year or have committed electoral offences within the previous ten years, or are insane or under a death sentence.

===Senate===
The Senate is unelected and consists of 17 members appointed by the Governor-General; eleven on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the leader of the opposition, one on the advice of the Barbuda Council and one at the discretion of the Governor-General.

==History==
Universal suffrage was introduced in 1951, although less than 20% of the population was registered to vote during the 1950s. The first elections held under this system resulted in a victory for the Antigua Labour Party, which won all eight seats. The ALP dominated Antiguan politics, winning every seat in elections held in 1956, 1960 and 1965. During this period voter turnout remained low, dropping to just 38% for the 1960 elections. Although they were defeated by the Progressive Labour Movement in 1971, the party regained power in 1976 (despite receiving fewer votes than the PLM) and remained the ruling party until 2004 under the leadership of Vere Bird and later his son, Lester Bird. During this period elections were considered to be neither free nor fair. After taking over from his father prior to the 1994 elections, Lester had promised to fight corruption. However, the elections that year remained neither free nor far, with no guarantee of secret balloting, a voter registration open to abuse and the voter roll being inflated by 25% with emigrants or deceased residents. Continued irregularities in the 1999 elections were noted by a Commonwealth observer group, which recommended the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission and year-round registration for elections. The Commission was set up in 2001 and the ALP&#x27;s second period of dominance ended with defeat by the United Progressive Party in the 2004 elections. The UPP won a second term in office in 2009. However, in the 2014 general election, the Antigua Labour Party won 14 of 17 seats, while the ruling UPP won the other three seats. In the 2018 general election, held on 21 March, the ABLP won 15 seats, the UPP won 1 seat and the Barbuda Peoples Movement the seat for Barbuda.

<text>The Blue Sky Rangers is a group of Intellivision game programmers who previously worked for Mattel in the early 1980s.

When the Intellivision first came out in 1978, its games were all developed by an outside firm, APh Technological Consulting. Realizing that potential profits are much greater with first party software, Mattel formed its own in-house software development group. The original five members of that Intellivision team were manager Gabriel Baum, Don Daglow, Rick Levine, Mike Minkoff and John Sohl. Levine and Minkoff (a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team. To keep these and later programmers (the Mattel team peaked at 110 people in 1983) from being hired away by rival Atari, their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret.

In 1982, &quot;TV Guide&quot; published an article about Intellivision&#x27;s secret programming team. The writer of the article wanted to come up with some group name other than &quot;The Application Software Programmers,&quot; so he came up with the name &quot;The Blue Sky Rangers.&quot; This was based on the programming group&#x27;s &quot;Blue Sky Meetings,&quot; which were a series of brainstorming sessions for new game ideas.

This name stuck and the programmers were (and still are) collectively referred to as the Blue Sky Rangers. One of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, re-acquired the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers&#x27; games are now available on a variety of computers and video game platforms, as well as mobile phones. These copyrights are currently held by Atari SA, who acquired the Intellivision brand name and related assets from the former Intellivision Entertainment in 2024. Astrosmash and Shark! Shark!, two prominent Intellivision titles, were not included in the sale, as the two properties were already sold to BBG Entertainment GmbH in the preceding year.

<text>Peter O. Phillips (born June 21, 1970), better known by his stage name Pete Rock, is an American record producer, DJ and rapper. He is widely recognized as one of the greatest hip hop producers of all time, and is often mentioned alongside DJ Premier, RZA, and Q-Tip as one of the mainstays of 1990s East Coast hip hop production. He rose to prominence in the early 1990s as one half of the critically acclaimed group Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth. Early on in his career, he was also famed for his remix work.

After the duo went their separate ways, Rock continued with a solo career that has garnered him worldwide respect, though little in the way of mainstream success. Along with groups such as Stetsasonic, Gang Starr, A Tribe Called Quest and The Roots, Rock played a major role in the merging of elements from jazz into hip hop music (also known as jazz rap). Pete Rock is also the older brother and younger cousin, respectively, of rappers Grap Luva and Heavy D.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Peter Phillips was born in The Bronx in New York City the fourth of five children born to Jamaican immigrant parents, Leighton Phillips and Eda Phillips . His family moved to Mount Vernon, New York when he was seven years old. Around the time, his parents would take him and his younger brother (Grap Luva) to see James Brown at a concert in his neighborhood to where performers such as Marva Whitney, Lyn Collins, The JB&#x27;s would come perform and do shows and acts in front of the audience. He would meet James Brown backstage after a show for a meet and greet. Rock started scratching at the age 7 when one of his parents brought him home a toy record player by Fisher-Price. He began scratching after his first cousin, Floyd Myers, the older brother of Heavy D, taught Rock how to DJ. When Rock was 17, he learned how to make beats with the E-mu SP-1200 that Freddie Foxx gave him. Rock attended Mount Vernon High School. 

During high school, he met his future recording partner CL Smooth. He briefly attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice but was not a serious student and left to focus on his music career. According to Phillips, his father was also a part-time DJ who had an impressive record collection. Rock would often accompany his father to a cricket club called Wembley in The Bronx and watch as he spun records for the guests. His first job was as a paperboy, in his neighborhood. His first major exposure to the hip hop audience was in the late 80s with Marley Marl as a DJ on New York&#x27;s WBLS radio show &quot;In Control With Marley Marl&quot; at the age of 13. Propelled by the growth of his popularity, he began producing in the early 90s.

==Solo career==

After the breakup with CL Smooth in 1995, Rock continued working, remixing and producing for artists. He would be on Future Flavas with Marley Marl on Hot 97, which debuted in January 1995. In 1996, he produced a song called &quot;The Rap World&quot;, which Rock would rap alongside Large Professor on &quot;High School High&quot; soundtrack. He made other guest appearances on albums, including Diamond D&#x27;s 1997&#x27;s &quot;Hatred, Passions and Infidelity&quot; LP, the song called &quot;Painz &amp; Strife&quot; featuring Phife Dawg of A Tribe Called Quest. Rock released his first solo debut album, &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; on November 10, 1998, on Loud Records. The album would feature hit singles, &quot;Tru Master&quot; featuring Inspectah Deck amd Kurupt and &quot;Take Your Time&quot; featuring R&amp;B group Loose Ends. In the early year of 2000, he worked out a deal with BBE, a label based in the UK and released &quot;PeteStrumentals&quot;, an instrumental album that features no vocals, excerpt for tracks &#x27;Cake&quot; and &quot;Nothin&#x27; Lesser&quot; which performed by the UN (Divine, Godfree, Laku and Roc Marciano), a group that Rock brought in. The second version of &quot;PeteStrumentals&quot; for the Beat Generation series would be updated with new tracks after the release of J Dilla&#x27;s &quot;Welcome 2 Detroit&quot; album in 2001. 

In 2003, Rock would also release a compilation album, &quot;Lost &amp; Found: Hip Hop Underground Soul Classics&quot; on October 27, 2003, on BBE records. The album contains a double disc package that feature two albums that were recorded in 1995–96 and shelved by the label Elektra Records. He went on to release more albums under BBE, including his third album &quot;Soul Survivor II&quot; on May 11, 2004 and his second instrumental album, &quot;The Surviving Elements: From Soul Survivor II Sessions&quot; on January 31, 2005 Rock would collaborate with Boston rapper Ed O.G. on a project called &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot; in 2004, by produced entirely by Rock, with additional production by Diamond D, DJ Revolution and DJ Supreme One. In 2006, after Rock parted ways with BBE, Rock signed with Nature Sounds for his fourth album, &quot;NY&#x27;s Finest&quot; on February 26, 2008.

Rock oversaw the production of &quot;Jay Stay Paid&quot;, a posthumous album by the producer J Dilla, released June 2, 2009, on Nature Sounds. Following that, Pete Rock joined Kanye West in Hawaii, who traveled there to work on the latter&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. In addition, he and DJ Premier have announced that they are working on a joint album together, although further details are unknown. In London, he confirmed that Big Pooh and C.L. Smooth will be on his half of the VS album and he planned on releasing five albums in 2011, including reuniting with C.L. Smooth for a third album, and dropping his fourth album on Nature Sounds. His next few collaborative albums are both due for a summer release with &quot;Monumental&quot; first then with Camp Lo&#x27;s &quot;80 Blocks From Tiffanys&quot; LP. 

In an April 2011 interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, Pete Rock discussed his new solo work including his album with DJ Premier, as well as exploring the fact that he has had numerous beats rejected by Eminem over the years Pete Rock Uncensored Radio Interview. In an August 2011 interview, he has confirmed the completion of the Camp Lo album &quot;80 Blocks from Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and that he is currently working on production for Torae&#x27;s album, Elzhi &amp; his own solo album &quot;PeteStrumentals 2&quot;. 

Pete Rock announced on Twitter that &quot;PeteStrumentals 2&quot; is indeed confirmed finished and scheduled for a 2015 release. The project was released on June 23, 2015, on the indie label Mello Music Group. 

On January 2, 2019, Rock posted a trailer video on his Instagram page announcing that new works will be coming soon, including &quot;Return of the SP1200&quot; (which was released on April 13, 2019, exclusively on vinyl (Record Store Day) and released digitally on April 26, 2019), &quot;PeteStrumentals 3&quot; (a continuation to 2001&#x27;s &quot;PeteStrumentals&quot; and 2015&#x27;s &quot;2&quot;), &quot;Don&#x27;t Smoke Rock 2&quot; (also a continuation to &quot;Don&#x27;t Smoke Rock&quot;) featuring Smoke DZA, and an album with rapper Skyzoo. Rock confirms to Okayplayer that he is working on his sixth instrumental album called &quot;PeteStrumentals 4&quot;, another continuation to Rock&#x27;s previous PeteStrumentals series releases. 

The project was finished on June 30 and it&#x27;s scheduled for a 2022 release on Tru Soul records. The project was released on March 31, 2022. In 2024, Rock collaborated with rapper Common with the release of &quot;The Auditorium, Vol. 1&quot; which came out on July 12, featuring the first hit single, &quot;Wise Up&quot;.

==Affiliates==
===Proteges===
Through the years, Rock has helped to jump-start the careers of several artists. His first project outside of Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth was the hardcore duo YG&#x27;z, who released an EP called &quot;Street Nigga&quot; in 1993, with four out of the six tracks produced by Rock; however, they were quickly dropped from their deal with Reprise Records. His next venture, INI, was a group featuring Rock, his younger brother Grap Luva, Ras G and rapper Rob-O. They released a single, &quot;Fakin&#x27; Jax&quot;, through Elektra Records in 1995, before their debut album, &quot;Center of Attention&quot;, was shelved by the label. The other two members continue to record solo material, albeit only sporadically. In an interview Rock elaborated on the situation:

===Relationship with CL Smooth===
Since their split in 1995, Pete Rock&#x27;s relationship with CL Smooth has been highly unpredictable. Although the pair briefly united for the reflective &quot;Da Two&quot; from Rock&#x27;s &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; album in 1998, they avoided entertaining requests for a reunion album until 2001, when they once again teamed up for &quot;Back on Da Block&quot; from Rock&#x27;s &quot;PeteStrumentals&quot;. In their interviews during this period, it appeared as though a new album was underway. As Rock would explain:

The pair went on a short international tour culminating in their well-received show at London&#x27;s Jazz Cafe; however, soon after this they declined to comment any further on the new album, which never materialized (although Smooth did make three separate appearances on &quot;Soul Survivor II&quot;). Eventually, Smooth would confirm rumors of a rift in an interview with AllHipHop.com, in which he appeared angry and frustrated with his former partner, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t ask him to be a superhero&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not the problem&quot;. In an interview taken in December 2006, Rock ruled out any further collaborations with Smooth but stated that he holds no grudges against his former partner.

On June 1, 2024, on an interview with &quot;Drink Champs&quot;, Rock addresses the split between him and his partner CL Smooth:

==Musical style==
===Production===

Pete Rock creates beats from samples, the majority of which are taken from obscure R&amp;B, funk, and jazz records. This paying true homage to the Black American musical traditions that are the foundation and origins of Hip-Hop music. Early on in his career he would also sample drum breaks such as Black Heat&#x27;s &quot;Zimba Ku&quot; for Heavy D &amp; The Boyz&#x27;s &quot;Letter To The Future&quot;. Pete Rock heavily used the E-mu SP-1200 as well as the Akai S950—later moving onto using the MPC—for his productions. Pete Rock tends to use the samples as palettes for his beats, chopping (cutting the sample into smaller parts), filtering (altering the frequencies of the sample), and layering several samples, often within the same song. While this technique was applied long before Rock (on De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;Three Feet High and Rising&quot; or the work of The Bomb Squad for example), Rock&#x27;s work is distinctive for the way in which he uses samples to achieve a hazy, droning effect. He is also noted for his resonant basslines, horn samples, and gritty sounding drums. His beats often sound as though they were being played from an old vinyl record; he samples many of his sounds straight off these records. He frequently recorded at Greene St. Recording in Manhattan, having liked the equalizer that was used there, which gave many of his productions a wah-wah effect.

Another trait of his, more so in the earlier part of his career, is the way he uses horn samples to supplement his grooves. On &quot;They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)&quot;, Rock uses a horn sample from Tom Scott&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;; he has also used horns on &quot;Straighten It Out&quot;, Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot;, Rah Digga&#x27;s &quot;What They Call Me&quot;, and A.D.O.R.&#x27;s &quot;Let It All Hang Out&quot;.

Along with Gang Starr, The Roots and A Tribe Called Quest, Pete Rock played a large role in the fusing of jazz and funk music into hip hop. The aforementioned &quot;Reminisce...&quot; withstanding, Rock used many jazz samples on his album &quot;Mecca and The Soul Brother&quot;, such as Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s &quot;Country Preacher&quot;, for the song &quot;Return of the Mecca&quot;, or &quot;Capricorn&quot; for the song &quot;In the House&quot; from &quot;The Main Ingredient&quot;. Pete Rock&#x27;s heavy use of intro and outro beats has also been widely influential. To introduce feature songs, he often plays a short instrumental excerpt, completely different from the rest of the song. Aside from their role as transitions, these are widely regarded as a way of displaying his large collection and as a challenge to other hip-hop producers to identify the records that the breaks come from. &quot;Mecca &amp; the Soul Brother&quot; and &quot;The Main Ingredient&quot; use intro/outro beats on nearly every track to great effect, and the tradition continues to the present on Rock&#x27;s recent releases.

===Remixes===
&quot;Another Pete Rock Remix&quot; is Pete Rock&#x27;s trademark catchphrase, heard on countless singles that he has remixed. In addition to hip-hop artists he has done remix work for artists from other genres such as his 1995 remix of &quot;Before You Walk Out Of My Life&quot; for R&amp;B singer Monica. In 1992 he collaborated with Mary J. Blige on the &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; single &quot;Reminisce&quot;, which used the same sample from his own single &quot;They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)&quot;. Rock claims to have done several high-profile remixes that remain unreleased, including one of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Secret&quot;. He also claims to have produced the original beat for The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Juicy&quot; and that it was recreated by P. Diddy and Poke (of Tone &amp; Poke fame), without consent. However, he was invited to produce the remix, which uses the same sample as the original—Mtume&#x27;s &quot;Juicy Fruit&quot;. Although he received no official producer credit, he made the original demo beat for A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;Jazz (We&#x27;ve Got)&quot;, which was then recreated by Q-Tip on the album &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;. He remixed Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Shut &#x27;em Down&quot; and &quot;Nighttrain&quot; in the same day, starting at 12 pm and finishing at 12 am.

Up until 2003, he created all of his productions on the E-mu SP-1200, thereafter using the Akai MPC2000XL. He also has a collection of about 90,000 records and looks for records at least once a week. Pete Rock was one of nine artists who participated in thetruth.com&#x27;s Remix Project, where he remixed the Sunny Side song &quot;Magical Amount&quot;.

===Influence===
Pete Rock himself being overwhelmingly influenced by Black American musical traditions of Soul, Jazz, and R&amp;B music, was able to pay it forward. Pete Rock has had a considerable impact on a number of record producers who have emerged in the hip hop scene since the late 1990s. Critics have favorably compared Detroit producer J Dilla and North Carolina&#x27;s 9th Wonder to Rock; both of them worked with Rock during their recording careers. Several of the comparisons stem from the fact that these producers have created the bulk of their productions out of samples, as well as the warm, mellow, and exuberant undertones apparent in their work. Pete Rock himself has added validation to the comparisons with J Dilla by stating &quot;he&#x27;s the only producer in this game that was just as serious [as me].&quot;

==Personal life==
Rock is an avid Marvel fan. He enjoys reading and collecting comic books of his favorite superhero characters, such as The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, and X-Men. Rock is also an avid fan of the NFL football team New York Giants and the NBA basketball team New York Knicks.

==Legacy==
A publisher from TV One called Pete Rock &quot;the most visionary and renowned producers in Hip Hop history&quot;. Rock is viewed as the most prolific, influential, and respected hip-hop producers of all-time. A writer from Yellow Brick, called Pete Rock&#x27;s music &quot;a unique sound, which blends jazz and soul samples with hard-hitting drums, has inspired countless producers and helped shape the sound of hip hop.&quot;

<text>The Yakovlev UT-1 () was a single-seater trainer aircraft used by the Soviet Air Force from 1937 until the late 1940s.

==Development==
The Yakovlev UT-1 was designed as a single-seater advanced trainer and aerobatic airplane by the team led by Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev. The first prototype, designated the AIR-14, was flown in early 1936. The AIR-14 was a small low-winged monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with a welded steel fuselage and wooden wings.

After some changes, the AIR-14 was accepted for production. Among other improvements, the 75 kW (100 hp) Shvetsov M-11 radial was changed to the more powerful 86 kW (115 hp) M-11G. The plane received the designation UT-1 (&quot;uchebno-trenirovochnyi&quot; {учебно-тренировочный}, primary/advanced trainer); despite this designation, it was not suitable for primary training.

The UT-1 was used as a transitional type between the UT-2 and fighters like the I-16. It was not easy to fly, requiring precise piloting, thus forming an ideal intermediate between basic trainers and the maneuverable but difficult-to-fly I-16. In 1939 the plane was modified by moving the engine 26 cm (10 in) forward, which improved its handling. During production, the 112 kW (150 hp) M-11E engine was also used. Soviet pilots broke several records with the UT-1 before World War II, some with its floatplane variant. In total, 1,241 aircraft were built between December 1936 and 1940.

During World War II, from 1941, the UT-1 was also used for reconnaissance. Some were used as improvised combat machines, after fitting with underwing machine guns or even two unguided rockets. In February 1942, about 50 UT-1 were converted in workshops as improvised UT-1B (УТ-1б) ground-attack planes, fitted with two machine guns and two-four rockets. They were next used in Black Sea Fleet aviation in Sevastopol and Caucasus. The survivors were disarmed in December 1942.

==Variants==
There were a large number of variants, the most numerous or noteworthy were:

* AIR-14 - Prototype of UT-1
* AIR-18 - UT-1 with a 104 kW (140 hp) Renault Bengali 4 inline engine and closed canopy, retractable undercarriage.
* AIR-21 (Ya-21, UT-21) - UT-1 with 164 kW (220 hp) Renault Bengali 6 engine, tested in 1938-39, fixed undercarriage.
* UT-1B - Wartime attack version with two ShKAS machine guns and two or four RS-82 rockets.
* UT-1E - (UT-1(15) For tests at TsAGI (sometimes confused with AIR-15, which was not a variant of UT-1).
* UT-1 Floatplane - with M-11Ye engine which later became standard in the majority of UT-1&#x27;s.

==Operators==
*Soviet Air Force
*Soviet Naval Aviation
*Chinese Nationalist Air Force

<text>Dmalloc is a C memory debugger library written by Gray Watson to assist programmers in finding a variety of dynamic memory allocation mistakes. It replaces parts (such as malloc) of the C standard library provided by the operating system or compiler with its own versions, which produce information intended to help the programmer detect problematic code.

Dmalloc can find memory leaks, off-by-one errors, and usage of invalid addresses in some library functions calls.

<text>George von Lengerke Meyer (June 24, 1858 – March 9, 1918) was a Massachusetts businessman and politician who served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, as United States ambassador to Italy and Russia, as United States Postmaster General from 1907 to 1909 during the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt and United States Secretary of the Navy from 1909 to 1913 during the administration of President William Howard Taft.

==Biography==
Meyer was a native of Boston, reared in a patrician society. His paternal grandfather, George Augustus Meyer (also the name of von Lengerke Meyer&#x27;s father), had emigrated from Germany to New York City. Meyer graduated from Harvard in 1879, and for twenty years was in business as a merchant and trustee. In 1885, he married Marian Alice Appleton. He was a director of various trust companies, banks, manufacturing companies, and public utilities concerns. While managing his business affairs, he also held positions in state and local government, his public service beginning with his election as a member of the Boston Common Council, on which he represented ward 9 in 1889 and 1890. Later he served on the Boston Board of Aldermen in 1891. He then joined the Massachusetts Legislature, where for some time he served as speaker of the house. In 1898 he was appointed by Governor Wolcott as chairman of the Massachusetts Paris Exposition managers.

He was a conservative Republican, and in 1899 was appointed a national committeeman. Republican Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt appointed Meyer to ambassadorships in Italy (1900–1905) and Russia (1905–1907). His patrician roots facilitated his interactions with the nobility of Europe, then in control of the continent. Roosevelt often used him to deliver messages to Kaiser Wilhelm II in preference to the official ambassador, Charlemagne Tower. As ambassador to Russia, he presented Roosevelt&#x27;s proposals with regard to the Russo-Japanese War directly to the Czar.
Meyer also served as Roosevelt&#x27;s Postmaster General, from 1907 to 1909, where he directed the introduction of the first stamp vending machines of the country and the first coil stamps.

Upon taking office in March 1909, President Taft appointed Meyer to the position of Secretary of the Navy, a post which Meyer held throughout Taft&#x27;s term. During this period, the Navy made its first experiments with aviation, although Meyer initially opposed the project. In separate tests in 1910 and 1911, civilian pilot Eugene Ely proved the feasibility of carrier-based aviation, by taking off from and landing on a Navy warship.
After 1911, Meyer was an overseer of Harvard University. He retired from national politics and returned to Massachusetts after Taft left office in 1913. He joined the effort to reelect Theodore Roosevelt in 1916. The foremost critic of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s naval policies, on the outbreak of World War I he urged preparedness and criticised America&#x27;s naval administration. He was actively associated with the National Security League and the Navy League. Among the organizations for which he was a director were the Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., Old Colony Trust Co., Puget Sound Light &amp; Power Co., Walter Baker Co., and Ames Plow Co.

In December 1916 Meyer, Roosevelt and other philanthropists including Scottish-born industrialist John C. Moffat, William A. Chanler, Joseph Choate, Clarence Mackay, John Grier Hibben, and Nicholas Murray Butler purchased the Château de Chavaniac, birthplace of the Marquis de Lafayette in Auvergne to serve as a headquarters for the French Heroes Lafayette Memorial Fund, which was managed by Chanler&#x27;s ex-wife Beatrice Ashley Chanler.

He died in Boston on March 9, 1918.

==Legacy==
The Navy destroyer USS &quot;Meyer&quot; (DD-279), named in his honor, was commissioned December 17, 1919 and was in service until May 15, 1929.

George von Lengerke Meyer was a brother in the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Alpha chapter).

<text>Lake Express is a high-speed auto and passenger ferry that is in service on a route across Lake Michigan. &quot;Lake Express&quot; links the cities of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Muskegon, Michigan, from late spring to the fall of each year.

==Background==
The ship travels at a top speed of and makes the trip three times daily from each side of the lake during the peak of its operational schedule. &quot;Lake Express&quot; is able to cross the lake in two and a half hours. It was constructed by Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama, and began service on June 1, 2004. It was one of the first high-speed catamaran-style auto/passenger ferries built in the United States. It was also the first high-speed auto ferry to see service on the Great Lakes, beating out the &quot;Spirit of Ontario I&quot;, which was beset by a series of last-minute delays, by one month.

On August 21, 2005, the ferry rescued a man whose boat had capsized in the middle of Lake Michigan.

<doc id="935771" wikidata="Q6261237" url="?curid=935771" title="John Trevor (1626–1672)">
<text>Sir John Trevor III (1626 – 28 May 1672) was a Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1646 and 1672.

==Biography==
Trevor was a son of Sir John Trevor II (1596-1673) of Trevalyn Hall, Denbighshire and Plas Teg, Flintshire. His father was a member of parliament under James I and Charles I, and sat also in the parliaments of Oliver and of Richard Cromwell, and was a member of the council of state during the Commonwealth.

In 1646, Trevor was elected Member of Parliament for Flintshire in the Long Parliament and sat until the Barebones Parliament of 1653. Thereafter he was re-elected MP for Flintshire in 1654 for the First Protectorate Parliament, in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament and in 1659 for the Third Protectorate Parliament.

After filling several public positions under the Commonwealth and Protectorate he was a member of the council of state appointed in February 1660 and under Charles II, he rose to a high position. Having purchased the office of secretary of state he was knighted and entered upon its duties towards the end of 1668, just after he had helped to arrange an important treaty between England and France.

Trevor predeceased his father by a year, dying on 28 May 1672.

==Family==
Trevor married Ruth Hampden, daughter of John Hampden and had a son Thomas who was created Baron Trevor in 1712. One of Trevor&#x27;s great uncles was Sir Sackville Trevor (d. 1633), a naval officer, who was knighted in 1604; and another was Sir Thomas Trevor (1586–1656), one of the judges who decided in favour of the Crown in the famous case about the legality of ship money, and was afterwards impeached and fined.

<doc id="935775" wikidata="Q6215184" url="?curid=935775" title="John Trevor (speaker)">
<text>Sir John Trevor (&quot;c.&quot; 1637 – 20 May 1717) was a Welsh lawyer and politician. He was Speaker of the English House of Commons from 1685 to 1687 (the Loyal Parliament) and from 1689 to 1695. Trevor also served as Master of the Rolls from 1685 to 1689 and from 1693 to 1717. His second term as Speaker came to an end due to a bribery allegation; he was expelled from the House of Commons shortly thereafter.

==Early life==
John Trevor was born around 1637 or 1638, the exact date of his birth being unrecorded. His father, also called John Trevor, was the son of Sir Edward Trevor; his mother was Margaret Jeffreys, daughter of John Jeffreys and aunt of the celebrated judge. The family lived at Brynkinalt in the parish of Chirk in the Welsh county of Denbighshire.

Trevor was educated at Ruthin School, and he started his career as a clerk for his relative Arthur Trevor. From there he worked his way up with the help of the patronage of another relative George Jeffreys until he was appointed a king&#x27;s counsel by Charles II.

==Political and judicial appointments==

In 1685 he was appointed to the high offices of Master of the Rolls and Speaker of the House of Commons by James II. Being a Tory and a partisan of James II, the accession of William III saw Trevor deprived of his office. In 1690, however, he once again returned to parliament as Speaker. From 1693, he also once again held the judicial office of Master of the Rolls. Between 1692 and 1695, he represented Newry in the Irish House of Commons.

As Speaker, he was memorable for being severely cross-eyed—the affliction was so confusing to members of the House that they were frequently uncertain as to which of them had &quot;caught the Speaker&#x27;s eye&quot;, and would try to speak out of turn.

==Scandal==
He was accused of taking bribes from the East India Company and the City of London, and was investigated by a committee chaired by the Commissioner of Accounts, Paul Foley MP. On 7 March 1695, he was found guilty of accepting a bribe of 1,000 guineas from the City of London Corporation to aid the passage of a bill (for the relief of orphans) through the house. This was judged to be a &quot;high crime and misdemeanour&quot;. Trevor resigned from the Speakership on 14 March, and was expelled from the House of Commons on 16 March. He was not asked to refund the bribe and retained his judicial position until his death at the age of 79 or 80 on 20 May 1717.

==Family==

Trevor married Jane Mostyn, the daughter of Sir Roger Mostyn. They are known to have had four children: Edward, Arthur, John and Anne. Trevor&#x27;s wife predeceased him, dying in August 1704.

<text>Curtis John Pride (born December 17, 1968) is a former professional baseball outfielder who is deaf. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, and played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1993 to 2006 for the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, and Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In 2015, Pride was named MLB&#x27;s Ambassador For Inclusion. Since 2009, Pride has been the head baseball coach at Gallaudet University.

==Youth==
Deaf at birth from rubella, Pride developed oral skills early in his life and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Silver Spring, Maryland. He excelled in baseball, basketball, and soccer in high school. After high school, Curtis Pride attended the College of William and Mary. He was the starting point guard on the basketball team. He also was an excellent soccer player who played for the United States at the 1985 FIFA U-16 World Championship in China and scored two goals in the tournament, including the match winner against Bolivia. He was named one of the top 15 youth prospects in the world for that year and was a 1986 Parade Magazine High School All American soccer player. Pride uses his 5% residual hearing to help him speak and is a fluent lip-reader.

==Playing career==
Pride was originally signed by the New York Mets, but reached the major leagues with the Montreal Expos in 1993. At that time, he became the first deaf player in the majors since Dick Sipek in 1945. A left-handed hitter, with good plate discipline, and considerable speed, he never played regularly in the majors. Instead, he pinch hit or played in the outfield, usually left or right, as an injury replacement, and is regarded as an excellent fielder with a strong arm. His first Major League hit was September 17, 1993 in Montreal. Pride&#x27;s first four hits in his major league career were a double, triple, home run, and single.

Pride became a free agent before the 1996 season and signed with the Detroit Tigers, where he played well in a part-time outfield role. With fewer than 300 plate appearances in 95 games, he compiled career-high numbers in batting average (.300), home runs (10), RBI (31), runs (52), hits (80), doubles (17) triples (5), and stolen bases (11). He was expected to gain more at bats in future seasons as a result. But 1997 found him on the disabled list and he was released and signed by the Red Sox. After that, he played with the Braves, returned to Boston and Montreal, and saw a little action with the Yankees. He was signed by the Anaheim Angels in the 2004 season and was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake Stingers. In 2005, he was signed to a minor league contract with the Angels and was called up after an injury to Vladimir Guerrero. He was returned to the minors after Guerrero recovered from the injury. After spending 2007 spring training as a non-roster invitee for the Angels, he was assigned to start the season as a member of the Salt Lake Bees.

Pride signed with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the independent Atlantic League on April 15, 2008. He was released by the Blue Crabs on August 23, 2008.

In an eleven-season major league career, Pride batted .250 (199-for-796) with 20 home runs and 82 RBI in 421 major league games.

==Coaching career==
In 2008, Pride was selected to be the baseball coach at Gallaudet University, a school for the deaf. He remained head coach until 2024, when the university ended their baseball program. In the summer of 2011, he served as assistant coach for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

==Personal life==
Pride and his wife Lisa are involved in the &quot;Together With Pride&quot; foundation, which aids hard-of-hearing children through a hearing aid bank, according to the foundation&#x27;s website. There are several activities the foundation supports or hopes to support, such as a scholarship program, literacy, and mentoring.

In 1996, Pride received the Tony Conigliaro Award, given annually to an MLB player who best overcomes adversity through the attributes of spirit, determination, and courage. In 2016, he won the Henry Viscardi Achievement Award. Pride keeps homes in both the Washington, D.C. area and Wellington, Florida.

On the accession of George I in 1714 he was deprived of his offices for alleged Jacobite sympathies, but from 1726 he was restored to favour as Lord Privy Seal (1726 to his death), one of the Lords Justice Regents of the Realm (1727), Lord President of the Council (1730) and Governor of the Charterhouse.

In 1707 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.

<doc id="935787" wikidata="Q972029" url="?curid=935787" title="Gary Ackerman">
<text>Gary Leonard Ackerman (born November 19, 1942) is an American retired politician and former U.S. representative from New York, serving from 1983 to 2013. He is a member of the Democratic Party. On March 15, 2012, Ackerman announced that he would retire at the end of the 112th Congress on January 3, 2013, after fifteen terms, and would not seek re-election in November 2012.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Ackerman was born in Brooklyn, the son of Eva (née Barnett) and Max Ackerman. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Poland. He was raised in Flushing, Queens. He attended local public schools, Brooklyn Technical High School and graduated from Queens College in 1965. After college, Ackerman became a New York City School teacher where he taught social studies, mathematics, and journalism to junior high school students in Queens.

Following the birth of his first child in 1969, Ackerman petitioned the New York City Board of Education for an unpaid leave of absence to spend time with his newborn daughter but his request was denied, under then existing policy which reserved unpaid &quot;maternity-child care&quot; leave to women only. In what was to be a forerunner of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, then teacher Ackerman successfully sued the board in a landmark case which established the right of either parent to receive unpaid leave for child care. A quarter of a century later, now a congressman, Ackerman in the House–Senate Conference Committee, signed the report of the Family and Medical Leave Act which became the law of the land.

Ackerman&#x27;s second career move occurred in 1970, when he left teaching to start a weekly community newspaper in Queens called &quot;The Flushing Tribune&quot; which soon became the &quot;Queens Tribune&quot;. Ackerman served as its editor and publisher.

==New York Senate==
Ackerman was a member of the New York State Senate from 1979 to 1983, sitting in the 183rd, 184th and 185th New York State Legislatures.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Incumbent Democratic U.S. congressman Benjamin Rosenthal died on January 4, 1983. Ackerman won the special election with a plurality of 49%. In 1984, he won re-election to a full term with 69% of the vote. In 1986, he won re-election with 77%, and was unopposed in 1988 and 1990. After redistricting, he ran in New York&#x27;s 5th congressional district. He won the Democratic primary with 60%, and the general election with 52% against Republican county legislator Allan E. Binder. In 1994, he won re-election with 55% of the vote. Since then, he has won re-election with at least 63% of the vote.

On March 15, 2012, Ackerman announced that he would retire at the end of the 112th Congress on January 3, 2013, after fifteen terms, and would not seek re-election in November 2012.

===Tenure===
Ackerman was the Congressional delegate to the United Nations. In addition, he was the ranking Democrat on the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans. In 2002, he was awarded India&#x27;s third highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan for his contributions as member of the India Caucus in the Congress.

Ackerman was one of only 22 Congressman and one of 2 Democrats from New York to vote against a resolution calling for the protection of the symbols and traditions of Christmas. The resolution, which did not include language that would protect the symbols of other religious holidays, passed 401–22 in the House in December 2005. In April 2003 the Catholic League for religious and civil rights attacked Ackerman for voting against a non-binding resolution that would have declared a day of prayer in recognition of the U.S. war in Iraq.

Ackerman received an &quot;A&quot; on the Drum Major Institute&#x27;s 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues. Ackerman was also a member of the Cuba Democracy Caucus and is currently the head of the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians (ICJP).

Ackerman has missed voting on 80 occasions pertaining to a variety of issues, including the Pension Protection Act, the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act, and the Honoring the Contributions of Catholic Schools.

In June 2001, Ackerman honored King Christian X of Denmark for his wearing a yellow badge armband during World War II in support of the Danish Jews who had been ordered by the Nazi occupation to wear yellow badges, although Jews in Denmark were never forced to wear an armband, and the story is merely a legend.

====Health====
Among Ackerman&#x27;s significant legislative undertakings, was the passage of his Baby AIDS amendment to the Ryan White Care Act. The measure requires mandatory HIV testing of newborns and disclosure of the results to the mother.

Ackerman championed the issue of newborn testing after discovering that 45 states, including New York, tested babies for HIV but used the data solely to track the prevalence of the disease in the population, and did not disclose the results to the mothers. As a result, thousands of mothers brought their infants home from the hospital, never aware that their children had tested positive for HIV. Ackerman stopped the anonymous testing from being reinstated in years that followed.

Ackerman also scored a victory in his efforts to ban downed animals from being sold as meat in supermarkets, restaurants and butcher stores. For a decade, Ackerman warned that use of such livestock was not only inhumane treatment of animals but also risked causing a Mad Cow disaster in the United States. His legislation fell on deaf ears until December 2003, when his warning became prophetic and the Bush Administration—among those who had opposed the bill—finally imposed his ban through regulation.

Ackerman was also successful in getting Medicare to cover testing for prostate cancer.

In addition, Ackerman sponsored the first federal legislation to ban the use of handheld cell phones while driving.

====Finance====
Law of the land is Ackerman&#x27;s measure requiring banks and financial companies to notify consumers when negative information is placed on their credit reports. Ackerman also sponsored legislation which is now law that in the wake of the Enron, WorldCom and other corporate scandals, prohibits accounting firms from consulting for the companies they audit.

On October 3, 2008, Ackerman voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

On January 8, 2009, Ackerman introduced a bill to order the Securities and Exchange Commission to re-institute the uptick rule, limiting the circumstances under which traders can sell stock short.

On February 4, 2009, Ackerman criticized SEC Officials over the handling of tips given to them about the Bernie Madoff scandal. Ackerman believed that he was reflecting the public&#x27;s opinion, saying: &quot;How are they supposed to have confidence that if somebody goes to you with a complaint—gives it to you on a silver platter with all the investigations, with all the numbers, with all of the data, telling you exactly what he did, how he did it, and why he did it and how he knows that—and after a period after half a dozen or eight years, you don&#x27;t know anything?&quot;

====Foreign policy and terrorism====


On October 10, 2002, Ackerman was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

Ackerman also convinced the Defense Department to stop garnishing wages from certain U.S. soldiers serving in the war against Iraq. Although troops who serve in combat zones are not required to pay federal taxes, many soldiers had failed to be granted the exemption.

Other highlights include the Congressman authoring legislation that required President George W. Bush to impose sanctions against the Palestinian Authority for not complying with peace agreements it signed with the U.S. and Israel.

In his capacity as the then chairman of the Asia Subcommittee, Ackerman made history in the 1990s by traveling to North Korea to discuss non-proliferation. Upon his return to South Korea, Ackerman became the first person since the Korean War to cross the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone).

Enacted as well was his measure that prevents war criminals and human rights abusers who have perpetrated genocide, torture, terrorism or other atrocities, from entering the U.S. and deports those who have slipped in.

He convinced the German government to establish a US$110 million fund to compensate 18,000 Holocaust survivors and to investigate whether 3,300 former Nazi soldiers now living in the U.S. and collecting German pensions are war criminals.

Ackerman is also well known for his many missions to feed the starving people of Ethiopia and the Sudan and for playing a leading role in the rescue of Ethiopian Jews and aiding their emigration to Israel. Active in the Middle East peace process, Ackerman has met with the current and most past Israeli prime ministers and the heads of all the Arab countries in an effort to help secure peace in the region. He also ventured to Kashmir enduring sub-freezing winter temperatures in an attempt to secure the release of four western hostages.

In January 2011, Ackerman criticized Jewish organizations including the Jewish Voice for Peace and J Street for their perspective of what actions had to be taken for a lasting Mideast peace.

On January 12, 2009, Ackerman admitted to arranging a visit between Israeli officials and a defense contractor at the same time he was investing in that contractor. Although the visit did not result in any official deal between the parties, questions regarding his ethics were raised.

Ackerman was also successful in getting enacted, his bill that created the &quot;Heroes&quot; postage stamp, the revenue from which helps the families of rescue workers killed or permanently disabled while responding to the September 11 attacks. The stamp was based on a photograph entitled &quot;Ground Zero Spirit&quot;. In addition, the Congressman lobbied federal security officials—with the September 11, 2001, attacks in mind—to use retired law enforcement officers as screeners at New York airports and he pressed President Bush to make good on his promise to provide New York with US$20 billion in additional 9/11 disaster aid.

In 2011, Ackerman voted to extend expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act and voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012.

====State and local issues====
Ackerman participated in forcing the State of Hawaii to change its law that forbade blind individuals from bringing their guide dogs with them to the islands. The Congressman chaired an investigation and bipartisan hearing into whether New York City and Long Island officials properly used the spraying of Malathion during the West Nile virus outbreak. He also obtained federal funds to combat a return of the virus.

The Ackermans have three children: Lauren, Corey, and Ari. Ackerman is an amateur photographer, an avid stamp collector, and a boating enthusiast. He is also an Eagle Scout.

At the 2006 meeting of the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians (ICJP), Ackerman was unanimously elected to serve as the executive of the organization.

Ackerman was named an honorary graduate of the United States Merchant Marine Academy for his continued support of the service academy located in Kings Point, New York.

Ackerman also has a street named after him located in Central Islip, New York.

===Sexual assault accusation===
In the 1960s, Ackerman served as director of the Ten Mile River Boy Scout Camp. In 2019, a former camper filed a lawsuit accusing Ackerman of fondling him and forcing him to perform oral sex on Ackerman. The alleged abuse occurred in 1966, when Ackerman was 23 and the accuser was 17. Ackerman denied any wrongdoing but resigned from his position as a consultant for the Suffolk County Department of Civil Service.

<text>Robert Hampden-Trevor, 1st Viscount Hampden (17 February 1706 – 22 August 1783) was a British diplomat at The Hague and then joint Postmaster General.

==Origins==
He was the eldest son of the second marriage of his father Thomas Trevor, 1st Baron Trevor to Anne Bernard, née Weldon.

==Career==
He studied at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, graduated in 1725 and then became a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. In 1729 he was appointed as a clerk in the Secretary of State&#x27;s office. In 1734 he went to the United Provinces as secretary to the embassy under Horatio Walpole. He succeeded as head of the embassy in 1739, initially as Envoy-Extraordinary, and from 1741 as Minister-Plenipotentiary. During this time he maintained a regular correspondence with Horace Walpole.

In 1750 he was appointed a Commissioner of the Revenue in Ireland. He took the additional surname of Hampden in 1754, on succeeding to the estates of his relative John Hampden. Twelve years after he had succeeded his brother as Baron Trevor, he was created, on 14 June 1776, Viscount Hampden, of Great and Little Hampden in the County of Buckingham.

From 1759 to 1765 he was joint Postmaster General. He wrote some Latin poems which were published at Parma in 1792 as &quot;Poemata Hampdeniana&quot;. 

== Marriages==
He first had an unacknowledged Fleet Marriage and had two sons, one of whom, the Rev. Dr John Trevor, (1740-1796) was appointed Rector of Otterhampton in 1771, but who later moved to the Continent and eventually became Minister of the Protestant chapel at Ostend, where he died in 1796. He had five daughters by his first wife, one of whom was the seafarer Frances Barkley.

Trevor married secondly, on 6 Feb. 1743, at The Hague, Constantia, daughter of Peter Anthony de Huybert, lord of Van Kruyningen, by whom he left four children—Maria Constantia (who married Henry Howard, 12th Earl of Suffolk), Thomas, second viscount Hampden, John Hampden-Trevor, third viscount Hampden [q. v.], and Anne. 

His second son, John Hampden-Trevor, 3rd Viscount Hampden (1749–1824), died only three weeks after he had succeeded his elder brother Thomas Hampden-Trevor, 2nd Viscount Hampden, when the titles became extinct.

<text>James at 15 (later James at 16) is an American drama series that aired on NBC during the 1977–78 season.

The series was preceded by the 1977 TV movie &quot;James at 15&quot;, which aired on Monday September 5, 1977 and was intended as a television pilot for the series. Both were written by Dan Wakefield, a journalist and fiction writer whose novel &quot;Going All the Way&quot;, a tale of coming of age in the 1950s, had led to his being contacted by David Sontag of Twentieth Century Fox.

Sontag, the senior vice-president of creative affairs at Fox, had had a lunch meeting in New York City with Paul Klein, the head of programming at NBC. Klein said he needed a series for Sunday night. On the spot, Sontag pitched the idea for a coming-of-age series seen through the eyes of a teenage boy, including his dreams, fantasies, and hopes. Klein loved the idea and asked Sontag who would write it, with Sontag&#x27;s suggesting Dan Wakefield. Despite this unsourced account of the &quot;creation&quot; of the series, Sontag created no characters, no plotlines, and no settings. The on-screen credit for the series reads &quot;Created by Dan Wakefield,&quot; as it was Wakefield who worked out the specifics from Sontag&#x27;s general conceptual outline.

==Synopsis==
James Hunter (Lance Kerwin) is the son of a college professor (Linden Chiles) who has moved his family across the country to take a teaching job, transplanting James from Oregon to Boston, Massachusetts. James, who had Walter Mitty-like dreams and dabbles in photography, has a hard time fitting into his new surroundings. During the series run, when James turned 16, the title was updated accordingly. (11 episodes, counting the two-hour movie, were produced as &quot;James at 15&quot;, with the remaining 10 airing as &quot;James at 16&quot;.)

Wakefield, who was born and raised in Indianapolis but eventually moved to Boston, said he chose Boston both because he wanted to write about a city he knew well and because he was tired of television&#x27;s tendency to give programs settings in Los Angeles or New York City. To update his own memories of growing up, the writer spoke with adolescents from Boston.

==TV movie==
The movie premiered to high ratings, topping the ratings for the week of September 5–11, 1977, with a 42% share of the viewing audience, quickly prompting NBC to approve a series. Associated Press writer Jerry Buck wrote that the pilot movie &quot;captures the essence of growing up in America,&quot; adding &quot;It makes up for all the drivel we&#x27;ve had to put up with, such as &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;Hollywood High&quot;.&quot;

==Critical reception and controversy==
The show was highly praised for its realism and sensitivity, with a reviewer from &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauding the program&#x27;s avoidance of stereotyping characters: &quot;Sly, a jiving black student...has solidly middle-class parents deeply involved in classical music&quot; and a classmate discovers that her father makes more money as a plumber than James&#x27; professor father. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote:Not perfect, not revolutionary, not always deliriously urgent, &quot;James at 15&quot; is still the most respectable new entertainment series of the season. Consistently, it communicates something about the state of being young, rather than just communicating that it wishes to lure young viewers. And if it romanticizes adolescence through the weekly trials and triumphs of its teen-age hero, at least it does so in more ambitious, inquisitive and authentic ways than the average TV teeny-bop. 

Critics also approved of its handling of James&#x27; first sexual experience, with a Swedish exchange student (Kirsten Baker) in the episode which aired February 9, 1978— at which point the show assumed the name &quot;James at 16&quot;. However, head writer Wakefield quit in a dispute with NBC over the use of the euphemism &quot;responsible&quot; for &quot;birth control&quot; in the episode as well as the network&#x27;s insistence that James should feel remorse over his decision.

Behind the scenes, Martin Manulis and Joe Hardy, the show&#x27;s original executive producers, were replaced by Ron Rubin in December 1977. Despite the critical acclaim, the show lasted only one season. Kerwin was age 16 when the series began and had turned 17 when it was cancelled.

==Awards and nominations==
==Novelization==
Two novels were written by author April Smith: &quot;James at 15&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;.

==Legacy==
Kevin Williamson, the creator of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, cited this show as a major influence on him and named it as an inspiration for his show. Williamson said, &quot;&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; came out of my desire to do &quot;James at 15&quot; for the &#x27;90s. It was very provocative and way ahead of its time.&quot;

The Beastie Boys refer to the show in their song &quot;Hey Ladies&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m not James at 15 or Chachi in charge...&quot;), from the album &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;.

The title of The Breakup Society&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;James at 35&quot; is a reference to &quot;James at 15&quot;.

<text>Major Robert Odell Owens (June 28, 1936 – October 21, 2013) was an American politician and librarian who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2007, representing the New York&#x27;s 11th and then 12th congressional district. He was first elected to replace retiring representative Shirley Chisholm. Owens shepherded the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 through the House. He retired at the end of his term in January 2007 and was succeeded by Yvette Clarke.

==Early life and education==
Owens was born on June 28, 1936, in Collierville, Tennessee, to Ezekiel and Edna Owens. He was raised in Memphis, Tennessee, and his father worked in a furniture factory as a laborer. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1956 from Morehouse College, and a master&#x27;s degree in library science in 1957 from Atlanta University, now known as Clark Atlanta.

== Career ==

===Librarian===
Owens began his career in librarianship. After obtaining his master&#x27;s degree, Owens settled in Brooklyn, New York and began his career as a librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library from 1958 through the late 1960s. At the same time, Owens became active in the Congress of Racial Equality and other community groups. Owens, a community information librarian, became known for &quot;placing Brooklyn Public Library collections in public places such as laundromats, stores, bars, and anywhere people gathered.&quot; In 1969, Owens worked with a group of other New York librarians, including Miriam Braverman, Anne Littlejohn, Betty-Carol Sellen, Joan Marshall, Hardy R. Franklin, Pat Schuman, Andrew Armitage, and Mitch Freedman, to establish the New York Social Responsibilities Round Table. This organization became part of the New York Library Association and its mission was &quot;to create a central position for libraries and librarians in the battles for civil rights, social justice, peace, and ever-improved public access to education and information.&quot;

Although having moved from his career in librarianship into his political career, in 1979 and 1991, Owens was a featured speaker at the White House Conference on Libraries sponsored by the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. In 1987, Owens was awarded the American Library Association Honorary Membership, its highest honor.

===Politics===
In 1968, New York City mayor John Lindsay made Owens the commissioner of New York City&#x27;s Community Development Agency. After serving in this position for approximately five years, he successfully ran for and was elected to the New York Senate. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1975 to 1982, sitting in the 181st, 182nd, 183rd and 184th New York State Legislatures.

In 1982, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, replacing the retiring Shirley Chisholm, where he remained until his retirement in 2006. Owens became known as &quot;The Librarian In Congress.&quot; Owens&#x27;s career in Congress is marked by his advocacy for and support of library funding and education issues; in particular public libraries, school libraries, and librarianship. In Congress, he worked closely with American Disability activist Justin Whitlock Dart who often was visiting his office in Capitol Hill and provided testimony before Owen&#x27;s Subcommittee on Select Education in the House, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, prior to the passage of the ADA when it was being heatedly debated. Owens served as floor manager of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and aided in its enactment.

Owens represented a diverse district located within Brooklyn, New York, which included many African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Jewish Americans, including a large Hasidic Jewish community. His district included low income areas of Brownsville, a large Hasidic area of Crown Heights, the heavily Caribbean areas of Flatbush and East Flatbush, and the now upscale neighborhood of Park Slope. Although Owens won the 2004 Democratic primary with just 45.44% of the vote, he was re-elected in the 2004 general election with 94% of the vote. In 2006, Owens decided to retire at the end of his term (January 2007). In the 2006 election, Yvette Clarke, who had run against Owens in the 2004 primary, won the election and became Owens successor.

Owens was one of 31 House Democrats who voted to not count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 United States presidential election. Republican president George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

He was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He received an &quot;A&quot; on the Drum Major Institute&#x27;s 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.

===Later career===
In 2006, Owens decided to not pursue re-election and retired from Congress, thereby ending his political career. Owens indicated that he wanted to spend his time writing novels and poetry. In 2006 after Owens&#x27;s retirement decision, the Librarian of Congress announced that Owens would be appointed as a distinguished visiting scholar at the John W. Kluge Center with the position to commence in January 2007. During his time at the John W. Kluge Center, Owens&#x27;s work focused &quot;on a case study of the Congressional Black Caucus and its impact on national politics.&quot; Owens used his time at the Kluge Center to research and write his book &quot;The Peacock Elite: A Subjective Case Study of the Congressional Black Caucus and Its Impact on National Politics&quot;, which was published in 2011. Owens served as a senior fellow for the DuBois-Bunche Center for Public Policy at Medgar Evers College.

==Personal life==
Owens was married twice. His first marriage to Ethel Werfel ended in divorce after twenty-five years. From his marriage to Ethel, Owens had three sons: Brooklyn politician Chris Owens, actor Geoffrey Owens (best known for playing &quot;Elvin&quot; on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;), and Millard Owens. He then married Maria A. Cuprill (Maria Owens), and the couple had two children.

Owens died October 21, 2013 in New York City of congestive heart failure. He was 77.

<doc id="935830" wikidata="Q1738426" url="?curid=935830" title="Kelvin wave">
<text>A Kelvin wave is a wave in the ocean, a large lake or the atmosphere that balances the Earth&#x27;s Coriolis force against a topographic boundary such as a coastline, or a waveguide such as the equator. A feature of a Kelvin wave is that it is non-dispersive, i.e., the phase speed of the wave crests is equal to the group speed of the wave energy for all frequencies. This means that it retains its shape as it moves in the alongshore direction over time.

A Kelvin wave (fluid dynamics) is also a long scale perturbation mode of a vortex in superfluid dynamics; in terms of the meteorological or oceanographical derivation, one may assume that the meridional velocity component vanishes (i.e. there is no flow in the north–south direction, thus making the momentum and continuity equations much simpler). This wave is named after the discoverer, Lord Kelvin (1879).

==Coastal Kelvin wave==

In a stratified ocean of mean depth &quot;H&quot;, whose height is perturbed by some amount &quot;η&quot; (a function of position and time), free waves propagate along coastal boundaries (and hence become trapped in the vicinity of the coast itself) in the form of Kelvin waves. These waves are called coastal Kelvin waves. Using the assumption that the cross-shore velocity &quot;v&quot; is zero at the coast, &quot;v&quot; = 0, one may solve a frequency relation for the phase speed of coastal Kelvin waves, which are among the class of waves called boundary waves, edge waves, trapped waves, or surface waves (similar to the Lamb waves). Assuming that the depth &quot;H&quot; is constant, the (linearised) primitive equations then become the following:

* the continuity equation (accounting for the effects of horizontal convergence and divergence):

formula_1

* the &quot;u&quot;-momentum equation:

formula_2

* the &quot;v&quot;-momentum equation:

formula_3

in which &quot;f&quot; is the Coriolis coefficient, which depends on the latitude φ:

formula_4

where Ω ≈ 2π / (86164 sec) ≈ is the angular speed of rotation of the earth.

If one assumes that &quot;u&quot;, the flow perpendicular to the coast, is zero, then the primitive equations become the following:

* the continuity equation:

formula_5

* the &quot;u&quot;-momentum equation:

formula_6

* the &quot;v&quot;-momentum equation:

formula_7

The first and third of these equations are solved at constant &quot;x&quot; by waves moving in either the positive or negative &quot;y&quot; direction at a speed formula_8 the speed of so-called shallow-water gravity waves without the effect of Earth&#x27;s rotation. However, only one of the two solutions is valid, having an amplitude that decreases with distance from the coast, whereas in the other solution the amplitude increases with distance from the coast. For an observer traveling with the wave, the coastal boundary (maximum amplitude) is always to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere (i.e. these waves move equatorward – negative phase speed – at the western side of an ocean and poleward – positive phase speed – at the eastern boundary; the waves move cyclonically around an ocean basin).
If we assume constant &quot;f&quot;, the general solution is an arbitrary wave form formula_9 propagating at speed &quot;c&quot; multiplied by formula_10 with the sign chosen so that the amplitude decreases with distance from the coast.

==Equatorial Kelvin wave==

Kelvin waves can also exist going eastward parallel to the equator. Although waves can cross the equator, the Kelvin wave solution does not. The primitive equations are identical to those used to develop the coastal Kelvin wave solution (U-momentum, V-momentum, and continuity equations). Because these waves are equatorial, the Coriolis parameter vanishes at 0 degrees; therefore, it is necessary to use the equatorial beta plane approximation:

formula_11

where &quot;β&quot; is the variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude. The wave speed is identical to that of coastal Kelvin waves (for the same depth &quot;H&quot;), indicating that the equatorial Kelvin waves propagate toward the east without dispersion (as if the earth were a non-rotating planet). The dependence of the amplitude on &quot;x&quot; (here the north-south direction) though is now formula_12

For a depth of four kilometres, the wave speed, formula_13 is about 200 metres per second, but for the first baroclinic mode in the ocean, a typical phase speed would be about 2.8 m/s, causing an equatorial Kelvin wave to take 2 months to cross the Pacific Ocean between New Guinea and South America; for higher ocean and atmospheric modes, the phase speeds are comparable to fluid flow speeds.

When the wave at the Equator is moving to the east, a height gradient going downwards toward the north is countered by a force toward the Equator because the water will be moving eastward and the Coriolis force acts to the right of the direction of motion in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa in the Southern Hemisphere. Note that for a wave moving toward the west, the Coriolis force would not restore a northward or southward deviation back toward the Equator; thus, equatorial Kelvin waves are only possible for eastward motion (as noted above). Both atmospheric and oceanic equatorial Kelvin waves play an important role in the dynamics of El Nino-Southern Oscillation, by transmitting changes in conditions in the Western Pacific to the Eastern Pacific.

There have been studies that connect equatorial Kelvin waves to coastal Kelvin waves. Moore (1968) found that as an equatorial Kelvin wave strikes an &quot;eastern boundary&quot;, part of the energy is reflected in the form of planetary and gravity waves; and the remainder of the energy is carried poleward along the eastern boundary as coastal Kelvin waves. This process indicates that some energy may be lost from the equatorial region and transported to the poleward region.

Equatorial Kelvin waves are often associated with anomalies in surface wind stress. For example, positive (eastward) anomalies in wind stress in the central Pacific excite positive anomalies in 20 °C isotherm depth which propagate to the east as equatorial Kelvin waves.

In 2017, using data from ERA5, equatorial Kelvin waves were shown to be a case of classical topologically protected excitations, similar to those found in a topological insulator.

<text>Royal Air Force Gatow, or more commonly RAF Gatow, was a British Royal Air Force station (military airbase) in the district of Gatow in south-western Berlin, west of the Havel river, in the borough of Spandau. It was the home for the only known operational use of flying boats in central Europe, and was later used for photographic reconnaissance missions by de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunks over East Germany. Part of the former airfield is now called General Steinhoff-Kaserne, and is home to the Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr, the German Air Force Museum.

Also on the site of the former Royal Air Force station, but not part of &quot;General Steinhoff-Kaserne&quot;, is a school, the Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium, as well as houses for government employees of the Federal Republic of Germany. This part of the former airfield has since 2003 been part of the district of Berlin-Kladow.

==History==

===Luftwaffe use, 1934–1945===
The airfield was originally constructed in 1934 and 1935 by the Luftwaffe as a staff and technical college, &quot;Luftkriegsschule 2 Berlin-Gatow&quot;, in imitation of the Royal Air Force College at RAF Cranwell. The initial personnel came partially from the Naval Academy Mürwik. Opened on 1 April 1936, the air force college was renamed &quot;Luftkriegsschule 2&quot; on 15 January 1940. Its satellite airfields were Güterfelde and Reinsdorf. Airborne flying training ended in October 1944, due to fuel shortages. From 5 March 1945, aircrew officer cadets were retrained as paratroops, for ground operations which had very high casualties.

Clues to the airfield&#x27;s original use survive in the barrack block accommodation, each block of which was named after a famous German airman of the First World War, with the airman&#x27;s bust above the entrance door. The architect was Ernst Sagebiel, an architect who worked full-time for the Luftwaffe and also designed Tempelhof Airport. Other surviving features during the entire period of the airfield&#x27;s use as RAF Gatow (1945–1994) included light bulbs in the main hangars, many of which dated from the 1930s.

===UK Royal Air Force and Army Air Corps use===

====1945–1948====
Late April 1945, towards the end of the Second World War in Europe, the airfield was occupied by the advancing Red Army. Following the division of Berlin into four sectors, Soviet forces relinquished part of the airfield and access roads, the so-called Seeburger Zipfel to the British after the Potsdam Conference in exchange for West-Staaken on 30 August 1945. Earlier on 25 June 1945, 284 Field Squadron, RAF Regiment, arrived at Gatow by land via Magdeburg. Their reception by Soviet troops was extremely hostile, the Soviets attempting to confine 284 Field Squadron behind barbed wire fences, as the Squadron was said to have arrived &quot;too early&quot;. This set the pattern for relations, with Soviet checkpoints being set up beside the airfield manned by fully armed and unfriendly troops. RAF Regiment officers occasionally surveyed Soviet positions by air from Avro Ansons, and the tour of duty of RAF Regiment detachments at Gatow was limited to six months, because of the constant activity occasioned by the Soviet presence and the Berlin Airlift.

The first landing by a Royal Air Force aircraft was by Avro Anson serial number &quot;PW698&quot; on 2 July 1945 at 11.55 hours. Initially, Gatow was called &quot;Intermediate Landing Place No. 19&quot;, but on 19 August 1945 was renamed Royal Air Force Gatow, or RAF Gatow for short. The Station was given the Latin motto &quot;Pons Heri Pons Hodie&quot;, which may be translated as &quot;A bridge yesterday, a bridge today&quot;.

Among the aircrew who flew in to RAF Gatow was the then RAF Navigator Errol Barrow. During his distinguished RAF career, Barrow was posted to the personal flight of the Commander-in-Chief of the British occupation zone in Germany, Sir Sholto Douglas, as his Navigator. Douglas and Barrow became friends, and Douglas made Barrow Godfather to his only child. Barrow went on to be instrumental in achieving Barbados&#x27; independence and was the first and third Prime Minister of Barbados.

RAF Gatow was also used as a civilian airport for a limited time. In 1946, British European Airways (BEA) inaugurated an RAF Northolt – Hamburg – Gatow scheduled service at a frequency of six flights a week, using Douglas DC-3 (&quot;Pionair&quot; in BEA terminology) and Vickers VC.1 Viking piston-engined aircraft.

====Berlin Airlift, 1948–1949====
The Station was modernised with a long concrete runway, using 794 German workers, in March 1947. Along with the American airfield of Tempelhof and the French airfield of Tegel, RAF Gatow played a key role in the Berlin airlift of 1948. Initially, about 150 Douglas Dakotas and 40 Avro Yorks were used to fly supplies into Gatow. By 18 July 1948, the RAF was flying 995 tons of supplies per day into the airfield.

Alongside the Royal Air Force and various British civil aviation companies, the United States Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) and the South African Air Force all flew supplies into RAF Gatow during the Airlift.

On 20 June 1980, the Royal Australian Air Force presented a Douglas Dakota to RAF Gatow in commemoration of its role. Its aircrew included Air Marshal David Evans, an Australian airlift veteran. As only British, French and American aircraft were allowed under international law to fly inside the Allied Air Corridors, the Dakota received the RAF serial number ZD215. The Dakota is still at Gatow, inside the German Air Force barracks.

In November 1948, the latest RAF transport aircraft, the Handley Page Hastings, was added to the squadrons flying into RAF Gatow and some aircrews and aircraft were redeployed to train replacement aircrews. Many of these were based at RAF Schleswigland, near Jagel, which is currently used by the German Air Force and the Marineflieger. A Hastings aircraft, which served on the airlift and was later RAF Gatow&#x27;s &#x27;gate guardian&#x27; until the station&#x27;s closure, is now preserved in the &quot;Alliierten Museum&quot;. By mid-December, the RAF had landed 100,000 tons of supplies. In April 1949, commercial airline companies involved in the airlift were formed into a Civil Airlift Division (co-ordinated by British European Airways) to operate under RAF control. Apart from BEA itself, these included a number of Britain&#x27;s fledgling independent airlines as well, such as the late Sir Freddie Laker&#x27;s Air Charter, Harold Bamberg&#x27;s Eagle Aviation and Skyways. By mid-April, the combined airlift of all nations&#x27; operations managed to make 1,398 flights in 24 hours, carrying 12,940 tons (13,160 t) of goods, coal and machinery, beating their record of 8,246 (8,385 t) set only days earlier.
RAF Gatow has the unique and unlikely distinction of being the base for the only known operational use of flying boats in central Europe, during the Berlin Blockade, on the nearby Wannsee, a lake in the Havel river. On 6 July 1948, the RAF began using 10 Short Sunderland and 2 Short Hythe flying boats, flying from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to Berlin. These were supplemented by the flying boat operations of Aquila Airways, an early post-war British independent airline that became an operating division of British Aviation Services. The flying boats&#x27; specialty was transporting bulk salt, which would have been very corrosive to other aircraft, but was not as corrosive to the flying boats because of their anodised skins.

The novel &quot;Air Bridge&quot; by Hammond Innes is partially set in RAF Gatow at the time of the Berlin Airlift, and is notable for its accurate descriptions of the Station, including corridors and rooms within it. Some of the descriptions were still accurate some 40 years after the book&#x27;s publication.

====1949–1994====
After the Berlin Blockade, RAF Gatow served as an airfield for the British Army&#x27;s Berlin Infantry Brigade, and was prepared to revert to its role as a supply base, if another Berlin Airlift to West Berlin ever became necessary.

BEA moved to Tempelhof Airport in 1951, where most of West Berlin&#x27;s commercial air transport operations were concentrated from then on. Gatow&#x27;s non-military use after 1950 included several official visits by Queen Elizabeth and other members of the British royal family, which frequently took place over the years. The airport also handled trooping flights operated by British independent airlines such as British United Airways, Britannia Airways and Autair/Court Line under contract to the MoD.
The &quot;RAF Gatow Station Flight&quot; used two de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk T.10s, one of which is now owned by the &quot;Alliiertenmuseum&quot;, to maintain and exercise the British legal right under the Potsdam Agreement to use the airspace over both West and East Berlin, as well as the air corridors to and from West Germany to the city.

In the 1950s the base was also an important centre for intelligence gathering by Royal Air Force Linguists monitoring on a 24/7 basis Soviet air traffic broadcasts from its bases all over Eastern Europe.

These aircraft were also used for reconnaissance missions in co-operation with &quot;The British Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Mission to the Soviet Forces of Occupation in Germany&quot;, commonly known as &quot;BRIXMIS&quot;. Known from 1956 as Operation Schooner and then Operation Nylon, they were authorised, at the highest level, on an irregular basis to carry out covert photographic reconnaissance flights. All flights had to be notified to the Berlin Air Safety Center (BASC), a quadripartite organisation responsible for authorising all flights in the three Air Corridors and the Berlin Control Zone (BCZ). All the Chipmunk Flight Notification Cards in the BASC were stamped by the Soviets &quot;Safety of Flight Not Guaranteed&quot; due to their interpretation of the 1946 Agreement as excluding flights outside West Berlin. Within the BCZ were many Soviet and East German military airfields and other installations.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Chipmunk reconnaissance flights soon ceased and the two Chipmunks were flown to RAF Laarbruch, in Western Germany to await disposal action. Chipmunk WG466 was flown back to Berlin Tempelhof from RAF Laarbruch on 30 July 1994 and was donated to the &quot;Alliiertenmuseum&quot; in Berlin. It is currently on loan to the Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr at Gatow, WG486 is still in RAF service with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.

RAF Gatow was from 1970 also used by the UK&#x27;s Army Air Corps, &quot;7 Aviation Flight AAC&quot;, later renamed No. 7 Flight AAC being based at the station initially flying four Westland Sioux (UK-built Bell 47) and later three Westland Gazelle AH.1 helicopters.
A Signals Unit (26SU) was also based at RAF Gatow and on the Teufelsberg in the Grunewald. 26SU was a specialist Signals Intelligence unit operated by the RAF on behalf of GCHQ Cheltenham tasked with monitoring Warsaw Pact military communications over East Germany and Poland.

====Escapes to Gatow from East Germany====

At least three successful escapes were made from East Germany to RAF Gatow.

On 9 April 1978 the two East German brothers Lothar und Dieter Weber defected by flying a Zlin Z-42M light aircraft of the &quot;Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik&quot; (&quot;GST&quot; – an East German paramilitary training organisation) with the call sign DM-WNX to RAF Gatow. The escape had been planned over the previous three years. The aircraft was dismantled and returned to East Germany over the Glienicker Brücke with painted slogans such as &quot;Wish you were here&quot;.

On 24 June 1979 an East German glider landed at RAF Gatow, its pilot seeking political asylum. The glider was handed back to East Germany at the Glienicke Bridge four days later. The flying control surface lock for the rudder bore the message &quot;remove before the next escape&quot;.

On 15 July 1987, a young East German, Thomas Krüger, defected by flying a Zlin Z-42M light aircraft of the &quot;Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik&quot;. His first words to the RAF Police were a request for political asylum. He was handed over to the civil authorities and received West German citizenship. His aircraft, registration DDR-WOH, was dismantled and returned to the East Germans (by road) by RAF station flight personnel, complete with humorous slogans painted on by RAF airmen such as &quot;Wish you were here&quot;, &quot;Come back soon&quot;. DDR-WOH is still flying today, but since 1991 under registration D-EWOH.

====East German invasion plans====

The closest military neighbour to RAF Gatow was a tank unit of the &quot;National People&#x27;s Army&quot; (&quot;NVA&quot;) of East Germany. This was located immediately opposite the airfield, behind the section of the Berlin Wall which ran along the western side of the airfield, and was clearly visible from RAF Gatow&#x27;s control tower. The Berlin Wall section opposite Gatow was not in fact a wall, but a wire fence. East Germany claimed that this was a &quot;military courtesy&quot;, but nobody at RAF Gatow believed this, thinking that it was instead intended to make a military invasion easier. This surmise was confirmed after the reunification of Germany, when the East German invasion plans for West Berlin, codenamed &quot;Operation CENTRE&quot; were found. &quot;Grenzregiment 34 &quot;Hanno Günther&quot;&quot; of the &quot;Grenztruppen der DDR&quot; was allocated the task of attacking and occupying RAF Gatow. The invasion plans were continually updated, even in 1990 when it was clear that East Germany would soon cease to exist.

==Closure==
Following the reunification of Germany, the British ceded control of the station on 18 June 1994. The Station Flight and its two Chipmunk T.10s was disbanded on 30 June 1994. The station was handed back to the German Air Force on 7 September 1994.

The airfield was kept operational for a very short time, and then closed to air traffic in 1995. The western end of the two runways was later removed to make way for housing, leaving only the eastern portions, cut mid-field on a diagonal line. The remaining portions are used for the outdoor aircraft display.

The history of RAF Gatow and of western forces in Berlin from 1945 to 1994 is told in the Allied Museum.

== 1989 RAF Garrison ==
Below is the RAF&#x27;s garrison of the station in 1989:

* RAF Gatow Headquarters
* Gatow Station Service Squadron
* RAF Gatow Station Flight
* Air Traffic Control
* Catering Squadron
* Security Squadron
* No. 26 Signals Unit RAF
* Berlin Detachment RAF Provost &amp; Security Services (Germany)

==Current use by the German Air Force and the Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium==
The airfield is now called General-Steinhoff Kaserne. Units now based there are &quot;Bw Fachschule Berlin-Gatow&quot;, &quot;Fernmeldeaufklärungsabschnitt 921&quot;, &quot;Luftwaffenunterstützungskompanie Gatow&quot;, &quot;Kommando 3 Luftwaffendivision&quot;, &quot;Luftwaffenmusikkorps 4&quot; and &quot;Truppenambulanz Berlin-Gatow&quot;.

Also on the site of the former RAF station, but not part of &quot;General-Steinhoff Kaserne&quot;, is a school, the Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium, and houses for government employees of the Federal Republic of Germany. Since 2003, this has been part of the district of Berlin-Kladow.

The &quot;General-Steinhoff Kaserne&quot; is also home to the Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr, the museum of the Air Force which has many displays (including historic aircraft) and much information on German military aviation and the history of the airfield. Admission to the museum is free. The museum, which is run by the German Air Force, is under the technical and administrative chain of command of the &quot;Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt&quot; or &quot;MGFA&quot; (Military History Research Institute).

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 18 March 1947, a Hawker Tempest II (PR853) belonging to No. 16 Squadron RAF (piloted by W/O Angus Mackay) crash landed at Berlin-Kladow less than a mile away from RAF Gatow. The pilot survived.
* On 5 April 1948, a BEA Vickers 610 Viking 1B (registration: G-AIVP) operating that day&#x27;s scheduled flight from Northolt via Hamburg to Berlin collided during its approach to RAF Gatow head-on with a Soviet Air Force Yakovlev 3 fighter, which was performing aerobatics in the area at that time. As a result of the collision, the Viking spiralled out of control and crashed 1.9 miles from the airport on East German territory with the loss of all 14 lives (four crew, ten passengers) on board the aircraft. The Soviet fighter pilot was killed in the accident as well. The subsequent investigation established the Soviet fighter pilot&#x27;s action, which contravened all accepted rules of flying and the quadripartite flying rules to which Soviet authorities were parties, as the cause of the accident.
* On 15 March 1949, a Skyways Avro 685 York I freighter (registration: G-AHFI) crashed on approach to RAF Gatow, as a result of losing its port wing. This caused the aircraft to dive into the ground, killing all three crew members.

<text>Albert William Tucker (28 November 1905 – 25 January 1995) was a Canadian mathematician who made important contributions in topology, game theory, and non-linear programming.

==Early life and education==
Albert Tucker was born in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, and earned his B.A. at the University of Toronto in 1928 and his M.A. at the same institution in 1929. In 1932, he earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University under the supervision of Solomon Lefschetz, with a dissertation entitled &quot;An Abstract Approach to Manifolds&quot;. In 1932–33 he was a National Research Fellow at Cambridge, Harvard, and then University of Chicago.

==Career==
Tucker then returned to Princeton to join the faculty in 1933, where he stayed until 1974. He chaired the mathematics department for about twenty years, one of the longest tenures. His extensive relationships within the field made him a great source for oral histories of the mathematics community.

In 1950, Albert Tucker gave the name and interpretation &quot;prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&quot; to Merrill M. Flood and Melvin Dresher&#x27;s model of cooperation and conflict, resulting in the most well-known game theoretic paradox. He is also well known for the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, a basic result in non-linear programming, which was published in conference proceedings, rather than in a journal.

In the 1960s, he was heavily involved in mathematics education, as chair of the AP Calculus committee for the College Board (1960–1963), through work with the Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics (CUPM) of the MAA (he was president of the MAA in 1961–1962), and through many NSF summer workshops for high school and college teachers. George B. Thomas Jr. acknowledged Tucker&#x27;s contribution of many exercises to Thomas&#x27;s classic textbook, &quot;Calculus and Analytic Geometry.&quot;

In the early 1980s, Tucker recruited Princeton history professor Charles Coulston Gillispie to help him set up an oral history project to preserve stories about the Princeton mathematical community in the 1930s. With funding from the Sloan Foundation, this project later expanded its scope. Among those who shared their memories of such figures as Einstein, von Neumann, and Gödel were computer pioneer Herman Goldstine and Nobel laureates John Bardeen and Eugene Wigner.

==Students and legacy==
Tucker&#x27;s Ph.D. students include Michel Balinski, David Gale, Alan J. Goldman, John Isbell, Stephen Maurer, Turing Award winner Marvin Minsky, Nobel Prize winner John Nash, Torrence Parsons, Nobel Prize winner Lloyd Shapley, Robert Singleton, and Marjorie Stein. Tucker advised and collaborated with Harold W. Kuhn on a number of papers and mathematical models.

Tucker noticed the leadership ability and talent of a young mathematics graduate student named John G. Kemeny, whose hiring Tucker suggested to Dartmouth College. Following Tucker&#x27;s advice, Dartmouth recruited Kemeny, who became Chair of the Mathematics Department and later College President. Years later, Dartmouth College recognized Albert Tucker with an honorary degree.

Tucker died in Hightstown, N.J. in 1995 at age 89. His sons, Alan Tucker and Thomas W. Tucker, and his grandson Thomas J. Tucker are all also professional mathematicians.

===Tucker Prize===
At each (triennial) International Symposium of the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS) the Tucker Prize, in honour of A. W. Tucker, is given for outstanding thesis in the area of discrete mathematics.

<doc id="935847" wikidata="Q747940" url="?curid=935847" title="Urban Legend (film)">
<text>Urban Legend is a 1998 slasher film directed by Jamie Blanks, written by Silvio Horta, and starring Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Tara Reid, and Michael Rosenbaum, and is the first installment in the &quot;Urban Legend&quot; film series. Its plot focuses on a series of murders on the campus of a private New England university, all of which appear to be modeled after popular urban legends. In addition to its younger cast, the film features supporting performances from Robert Englund, Loretta Devine, John Neville, and Brad Dourif.

Filmed in Toronto in the spring of 1998, &quot;Urban Legend&quot; was released in the United States on September 25, 1998. It was a commercial success, grossing $72.5 million worldwide on a budget of $14 million, but received generally negative reviews from critics, with chief criticisms being that the film was a blatant rip-off of &quot;Scream&quot; (1996). The film has been credited by both cinema and folklore scholars as being one of the first major films to redistribute the urban legends and folklore depicted within it to the public.

It was followed by two sequels: &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot;, which was released theatrically in 2000, and the direct-to-video film &quot;Urban Legends: Bloody Mary&quot; in 2005. In February 2020, a reboot of the film was announced to be in development, but it was later canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the studio losing interest.

==Plot==
A killer decapitates Pendleton University student Michelle Mancini in the backseat of her car. At the campus coffee shop, student Parker Riley regales friends Natalie Simon and Brenda Bates by describing a massacre in the abandoned Stanley Hall dormitory, which journalism student Paul Gardner discredits as an urban legend. News of Michelle&#x27;s murder spreads the following day, but Dean Adams and campus police officer Reese Wilson seem determined to bury the story. Damon Brooks, a jokester fraternity member, attempts to console the notably-disturbed Natalie, who rejects his sexual advances while in his parked car at a bluff. When Damon goes outside to urinate, an assailant in a hooded parka attacks him and hangs him from a tree. Natalie flees for help, but Damon&#x27;s body and car have disappeared when she returns with Reese. Parker and his girlfriend Sasha Thomas assure Natalie that Damon has pranked her.

Later, while Natalie sleeps, the killer strangles her goth roommate Tosh Guaneri. She finds Tosh&#x27;s body in the morning, along with a bloody message scrawled on the wall. Distraught, she tells Brenda that she and Michelle, her high school friend, had received probation for causing a fatal car accident after driving with their headlights turned off and pursuing the first driver who flashed them. Paul meanwhile investigates local urban legends, and discovers that the Stanley Hall massacre actually occurred, with William Wexler, now a professor of American folklore, its sole survivor.

Dean Adams is murdered in the campus parking garage, and Reese later finds Wexler&#x27;s office disorganized and covered in blood. Meanwhile, Natalie, Brenda, and Sasha attend a fraternity party coinciding with the massacre&#x27;s 25th anniversary, during which the killer incapacitates Parker in the bathroom and murders him by forcing pop rocks and bathroom chemicals down his throat. Sasha departs to host her late-night talkshow at the campus radio station. During the broadcast, the killer attacks her and her assistant, and her screams are played live on air; the fraternity partygoers assume it is a prank referencing the massacre, but Natalie, fearing Sasha is in danger, rushes to the station, where she witnesses the killer murder Sasha with an axe.

Natalie soon finds Paul and Brenda on campus. Paul, convinced of Wexler&#x27;s complicity, escorts them away in his car. They stop at a gas station, and while Paul is inside, Natalie and Brenda find Wexler&#x27;s mutilated body in the trunk. The two women flee through the woods back toward campus as Paul pursues them. They become separated, and Natalie flags down the university&#x27;s janitor passing by in his truck. He picks her up, but the killer forces their car off the road, pursuing them in a separate vehicle. The crash kills the janitor, but Natalie leaves unscathed and flees on foot.

While passing Stanley Hall, Natalie hears Brenda&#x27;s screams from inside. In the building, she finds her friend&#x27;s corpses, along with an apparently dead Brenda outstretched on a bed; however, Brenda knocks Natalie unconscious moments later. When Natalie awakens, Brenda reveals herself as the killer, enacting revenge for her fiancé and high school sweetheart David Evans, the fatality in the road accident Natalie and Michelle caused. Brenda attempts to remove Natalie&#x27;s kidney, but is thwarted when Reese arrives and holds Brenda at gunpoint. Brenda manages to stab Reese with a switchblade, and when Paul arrives, Natalie gains control of the gun and shoots Brenda, who falls out a window, before leaving with him to get help for Reese. As they drive away, the two discuss how this will later be an urban legend and all the facts will be misconstrued. Paul asks, &quot;Well if this is an urban legend, where is the twist?&quot; Brenda then appears in the back seat and attacks them with an axe. Paul crashes the car on a bridge, causing Brenda to go through the windshield and into the river below.

Later, a group of students at a different university have recounted the events of Brenda&#x27;s killing spree, during which they say that her body was never discovered. Most of them disbelieve the tale, except for one young woman, revealed to be Brenda, who claims that the story was incorrectly told, and begins explaining &quot;how the story really goes&quot;.

==Cast==

==Urban legends depicted in the film==
The film depicts various urban legends, some of which are featured as murder sequences and others that are merely referenced or discussed in passing.

===Re-enacted===
* Michelle is murdered by a killer in the backseat. This legend is also referenced by various people looking at the backseat or talking about it.
* Coverage of Michelle&#x27;s murder in the university newspaper is covered up by the dean, referencing the &quot;University cover-up of campus murder,&quot; and the subsequent fears of the students reference the &quot;Hatchet man&quot; legend, which has an unnamed killer targeting college campuses at random. The origins of the latter have been traced to serial killer Richard Speck.
* Brenda and Natalie attempt to invoke Bloody Mary at the entrance to Stanley Hall.
* Professor Wexler suggests eating Pop Rocks and drinking soda at the same time. The death of Little Mikey from this is mentioned by Brenda. The killer later re-enacts this legend on Parker, substituting soda with cleaning chemicals.
* Damon is hanging from a tree while Natalie is waiting in the car below.
* Gangs driving with their headlights turned off, pursuing the first driver to flash them and running him off the road, is mentioned by Sasha in the library. It is later revealed that Natalie and Michelle did this, killing a young man; it is subsequently re-enacted by the killer on Natalie and the janitor and finally revealed as central to the killer&#x27;s motive.
* Natalie finds her roommate strangled to death in her bed with the note &quot;Aren&#x27;t you glad you didn&#x27;t turn on the light?&quot;
* The &quot;ankle slasher under the car&quot; legend is re-enacted on Dean Adams. 
* A guest at the fraternity party claims that the song &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; contains a real murder scream; meanwhile, Sasha screams for her life on air during her radio broadcast.
* Parker finds the remains of his dog in the microwave, resembling the &quot;Old Lady dries wet dog in microwave&quot; legend.
* The killer attempts to re-enact the &quot;kidney heist&quot; on Natalie.

===Referenced===
* A caller to Sasha&#x27;s radio show states that she replaced her roommate&#x27;s birth control pills with baby aspirin.
* A caller to Sasha&#x27;s radio show asks about having her stomach pumped after performing oral sex and ingesting semen.
* A couple suffering from penis captivus call in to Sasha&#x27;s radio show.
* Professor Wexler discusses the babysitter and the man upstairs legend during his lecture, and Brenda claims it happened in her hometown.
* Parker suggests placing spider eggs in Bubble Yum as the killer&#x27;s next move.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
The concept for the film was developed by Silvio Horta, a recent film school graduate from New York University who was working at the perfume counter in a Nordstrom. Horta pitched the idea in late-1997 to Gina Mathews, a producer who was leading writers&#x27; workshops at the time. Mathews liked the story, and the two began further developing the concept before Horta drafted a screenplay. Producer Neal H. Moritz subsequently became involved, and agreed to co-produce with Mathews and Michael McDonnell. Horta and Mathews pitched the screenplay to numerous film studios, but none expressed interest in funding the project. In a last-ditch effort at getting the film made, Horta brought the screenplay to Phoenix Pictures, a then-new company who had only produced a small number of films. Mike Medavoy, an executive at Phoenix, was impressed by the concept, but Horta recalled that his screenplay &quot;needed to be better,&quot; and re-writes began to take place in the late-fall of 1997.

In seeking a director, executive producer Brad Luff scouted potential filmmakers from Australia, and was impressed by then-26-year-old Jamie Blanks&#x27;s short horror film, &quot;Silent Number&quot;, which he had made as his thesis film while attending film school in Melbourne. Blanks had initially wanted to direct producer Moritz&#x27;s &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997), and went so far as directing a mock-trailer for the project, but Jim Gillespie had already been hired to direct it. Instead, Blanks was offered the screenplay to &quot;Urban Legend&quot;, and signed on as director in February 1998.

===Pre-production===
Jared Leto was cast in the role of Paul Gardner, the student journalist investigating the murders. Mathews recalled that he was cast based on a &quot;dark&quot; quality he possessed that was at odds with his conventional appeal, and because he was already an established actor, known for his role on the teen drama series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. Alicia Witt was cast as the female lead, Natalie, as the producers felt she was &quot;against type&quot; and also a strong actress, whose previous credits included David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and the series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990). Witt said she was intrigued by the prospect of playing a survivor character who has to endure &quot;extraordinary circumstance[s].&quot;

Rebecca Gayheart auditioned for the role of Brenda, Natalie&#x27;s friend who eventually unveils herself as the film&#x27;s villain. Numerous actresses were interested in the role, and Gayheart recalled having to &quot;go in and fight&quot; for the part. She read for the role numerous times, and performed multiple screen tests before the producers settled on her for the part.

Of the supporting cast, Joshua Jackson was granted the role of Damon, the joking fraternity member. At the time, Jackson had earned recognition for his featured role on the series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Michael Rosenbaum was cast as Parker, a friend of Damon; Rosenbaum was just beginning his film career, and had recently had a small role in &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; (1997). Originally, a different actor had been considered for the role of Parker, but Blanks ultimately wanted Rosenbaum for the part. For the role of Sasha, Parker&#x27;s girlfriend and the campus radio host, Tara Reid was cast.

Robert Englund, already well known for his portrayal of Freddy Krueger in the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series, appears as Wexler, a psychology professor. Englund agreed to the part after being impressed by the concept of the screenplay, and was also a fan of several of the other cast members. Loretta Devine was cast as Reese, the witty campus police officer. Devine identified with the role based on her past experience as a dormitory director at Brandeis University, which provided her insight into &quot;some of the goofy and dumb stuff they do.&quot; Danielle Harris, who had previously starred as Jamie Lloyd in &quot;Halloween 4&quot; (1988) and &quot;Halloween 5&quot; (1989), originally auditioned for the lead role of Natalie, but was instead cast as Tosh, her temperamental roommate.

In the role of Michelle Mancini, the ill-fated student who is murdered in the opening scene, actress Natasha Gregson Wagner was cast. Wagner was drawn to the part as she felt it encompassed a &quot;proper scene&quot; that she could &quot;sink [her] teeth into.&quot; Brad Dourif was given an uncredited cameo appearance as the gas station attendant who appears opposite Wagner in the opening sequence.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on April 20, 1998 in Toronto. The University of Toronto served as a stand-in for the fictional Pendleton University. The film&#x27;s production design was completed by Charles William Breen, who had previously worked on such films as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982).

The opening sequence was among the first to be filmed, as Blanks wanted to present a completed sequence to the producers early on to assure them of his directorial abilities. It was filmed on location at a gas station outside of Toronto; to achieve the effect of the storm, artificial rain machines were used. For the film&#x27;s final sequence inside Stanley Hall, the screenplay called for a dilapidated locale. The production found a rundown building in Toronto that was scheduled to be demolished, and were granted permission to shoot there. As the sequence takes place entirely at night, the crew built a scaffolding out of pipe that was then draped in black tarping, giving the appearance of it being nighttime while inside the building. The interiors during this sequence were lit with candlelight, and cinematographer James Chressanthis drew inspiration from &quot;El Norte&quot; (1984), aspiring for a &quot;ritual&quot;-like appearance.
Additionally, aerial images from Trinity College School in Port Hope, were used for Pendleton campus.

Throughout the shoot, Blanks sought to keep on-screen violence &quot;muted&quot; or implied rather than shown in explicit detail. Several moments of violence written in the script were not filmed, among them a shot of Wagner&#x27;s character&#x27;s severed head rolling onto the road after her death. The death sequences in the film, however, required significant technical planning, with Sid Armour providing makeup effects. Reid performed her own stunts during her character&#x27;s chase sequence, including the fall over the staircase landing, during which she was secured by a harness. According to Reid, the stuntman who performed the scene used a real ax throughout the filming of it.

===Post-production===
Post-production of the film took place in Los Angeles over a period of less than two months, beginning in July 1998 and to be completed for the film&#x27;s September 25 release. During the post-production process, producer McDonnell returned to Toronto to complete pick-ups. A rough cut was pre-screened for a test audience in Pasadena during post-production, and the audience response was favorable.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Christopher Young, who had previously scored several horror films, including &quot;The Dorm That Dripped Blood&quot; (1982) and &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (1987). Producer McDonnell had previously been in a band with Young in the 1970s in their home state of New Jersey. While Young admired the synthesizer scores of such films as &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), Blanks insisted that he compose an orchestral score, which was more in alignment with Young&#x27;s composing background.

There were two albums released from film, the original score by composer Christopher Young, and the original motion picture soundtrack.


Additional songs featured in the film:
* &quot;Save Yourself&quot; by Stabbing Westward
* &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; by Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies
* &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; by Bonnie Tyler
* &quot;Comin&#x27; Back&quot; by The Crystal Method
* &quot;Spookshow Baby&quot; by Rob Zombie

* &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; by Ohio Players
* &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot; by Paula Cole
* &quot;The End of Sugarman&quot; by Roy Ayers
* &quot;I Know God&quot; by David Ivy

==Release==

&quot;Urban Legend&quot; was released on DVD by Columbia-TriStar Home Video on February 23, 1999. The release contained an audio commentary with director Blanks, writer Horta, and actor Michael Rosenbaum, as well as a making-of-featurette. The film received a region-free Blu-ray release on July 22, 2008 by Sony. Scream Factory released a 2-disc collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray of the film on November 20, 2018.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Urban Legend&quot; premiered at the Fox Village Theatre in Westwood Village, Los Angeles, before being released theatrically in the United States on September 25, 1998. The film earned $10.5 million in its opening weekend (nearly recouping its $14 million budget), showing at 2,257 theaters across the United States. It would go on to gross $38 million domestically, and earn an additional $34 million internationally for a worldwide total of $72.5 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Elements of &quot;Scream&quot; reappear in a vastly inferior vehicle.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Many critics drew negative comparisons to Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot;, released two years prior.

Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;teen-age moviegoer&#x27;s dream&quot;, adding: &quot;It has familiar young television stars, familiar older stars with cult followings (Robert Englund as the aforementioned professor, John Neville as the dean), an edgy sense of humor, a tricky plot and characters too genre-savvy for their own good. Maybe there will be an oversaturation of &quot;Scream&quot;-inspired horror films someday soon, but this one feels fresh.&quot; Bob Heisler of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it an unoriginal &quot;low-voltage drive-in movie, made strictly by-the-book.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film two out of four stars, but praised Christopher Young&#x27;s musical score, and adding: &quot;The film is competently made, and the attractive cast emotes and screams energetically, and does a good job of unwisely grabbing one another by the shoulders.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ty Burr wrote of the film: &quot;Proficiently filmed and utterly uninspired, it at least features a ghostly lead performance by &quot;Cybill&quot;s Alicia Witt and a final twist that&#x27;s entertainingly stupid. But why do all the characters have to be such nasty little dorks? Oh, right, otherwise we&#x27;d care about them.&quot; Kim Newman of the British publication &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Urban Legend&quot; manages somehow to be rather endearing, from Natasha Gregson Wagner&#x27;s opening bit (what must now, after &quot;Scream&quot;, be called &#x27;the Drew Barrymore position&#x27;) to the hokey shaggy-dog punchline.&quot;

===Accolades===
For her performance in &quot;Urban Legend&quot; Alicia Witt was nominated for a Saturn Award and the Fangoria Chainsaw Award. The film itself won Best Original Score for a Horror/Thriller Film at the International Film Music Critics Association Awards in 1998.

==Sequels==

A sequel titled &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; was released in 2000, and the direct-to-video film &quot;Urban Legends: Bloody Mary&quot; in 2005.

In February 2020, a reboot of the film was announced to be in development, to be written and directed by Colin Minihan. In August, Sydney Chandler, Katherine McNamara and Keith Powers were cast in the film. In October 2022, Minihan revealed that the film had been cancelled due to &quot;bad timing&quot;. In the following months, Eli Roth confirmed that it was due to the studio losing interest, and McNamara reported that it was due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Del Close (March 9, 1934 – March 4, 1999) was an American actor, writer, and teacher who coached many of the best-known comedians and comic actors of the late twentieth century. In addition to an acting career in television and film, he was one of the influences on modern improvisational theater. Close was co-founder of the ImprovOlympic (iO).

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Close was born on March 9, 1934, in Manhattan, Kansas. He ran away from home at the age of 17 to work in a traveling side show, but returned to attend Kansas State University. At age 19 he performed in summer stock with the Belfry Players at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. At age 23 he became a member of the Compass Players in St. Louis. When most of the cast—including Mike Nichols and Elaine May—moved to New York City, Close followed. He developed a stand-up comedy act, starred as the Yogi in the Broadway musical revue &quot;The Nervous Set&quot;, and performed briefly with an improv company in Greenwich Village with fellow Compass alumni Mark and Barbara Gordon. Close also worked with John Brent to record the classic Beatnik satire album &quot;How to Speak Hip&quot;, a parody of language-learning tools that purported to teach listeners the secret language of the &quot;hipster&quot;.

===Chicago years===
In 1960 Close moved to Chicago, his home base for much of the rest of his life, to perform and direct at Second City, but was fired due to substance abuse. He spent the latter half of the 1960s in San Francisco where he was the house director of improv ensemble The Committee, featuring performers such as Gary Goodrow, Carl Gottlieb, Peter Bonerz, Howard Hesseman and Larry Hankin. He toured with the Merry Pranksters, and he created light images for Grateful Dead shows. 

In 1972, he returned to Chicago and to Second City. He also directed and performed for Second City&#x27;s troupe in Toronto in 1977. Over the next decade he coached many popular comedians. In the early 1980s he served as &quot;house metaphysician&quot; at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; for many years, a significant percentage of the show&#x27;s cast were Close protégés. He spent the mid-to-late 1980s and 1990s teaching improv, collaborating with Charna Halpern at Yes And Productions and the ImprovOlympic Theater with Compass Players producer, David Shepherd.

In 1987, Close mounted his first scripted show, &quot;Honor Finnegan vs. the Brain of the Galaxy&quot;, created by members of Close and Halpern&#x27;s Improv Olympics from a scenario by Close, at CrossCurrents in Chicago. Running concurrently at the same theater was &quot;The TV Dinner Hour&quot;, written by Richard O&#x27;Donnell of New Age Vaudeville, featuring Close&#x27;s running routine as The Rev. Thing of the First Generic Church of What&#x27;s-his-name.

During this period, Close also appeared in several movies; he portrayed corrupt alderman John O&#x27;Shay in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and an English teacher in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. He co-authored the graphic horror anthology &quot;Wasteland&quot; for DC Comics with John Ostrander, and co-wrote several installments of the &quot;Munden&#x27;s Bar&quot; backup feature for Ostrander&#x27;s &quot;Grimjack&quot;. Close performed in the 1993 world premiere of Steve Martin&#x27;s &quot;Picasso at the Lapin Agile&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Steppenwolf Theatre Company.

===Personal life===
An obituary published in the &quot;Manhattan Mercury&quot; said that Close’s father died in Manhattan, Kansas, on December 16, 1954, after being found unconscious in his jewelry store and that the cause of death was “self-inflicted.” Close would have been 20 years old and, according to Kim &quot;Howard&quot; Johnson, a biographer in the documentary &quot;For Madmen Only: The Stories of Del Close&quot;, said that Close was in New York at the time, over a thousand miles away from where his father died.

Close had told many varied and dramatic accounts of his father’s suicide, with the general story being that his father did it right in front of him when he was a child (accounts vary in age between 6–17 years old) by drinking a caustic liquid (various accounts on which type of caustic liquid).

Regardless of when or how the suicide of Close’s father occurred, many of his friends believed it had a profound effect on him. Close would frequently bring it up in conversation with friends and even on stage. In the 2020 documentary &quot;For Madmen Only: The Stories of Del Close&quot;, he is filmed on stage saying to the improv actors and audience, “My father was a spectacular suicide. He drank a quart of sulphuric acid, slashed his wrists. And they kept him alive for two days longer than Jesus hung on the cross, and I used to use that death to get sympathy and to get laid with.” Then Close wanted to do an improv scene where he would play himself and another actor, Dave Thomas, would play the doctor who would tell Close that his father had just died from the suicide that Close had described. Thomas refused, saying in the documentary that he didn’t think it would be a good joke and that there was an obligation to the audience to create laughs—not just to make them gasp. Close replied, “Now perhaps you’re not used to this particular kind of horrifying honesty, but I expect the same thing from you and nothing less.”

Close was addicted to cocaine but decided to change his lifestyle when his student John Belushi died of a drug overdose in 1982. Close had recently read the book &quot;A Witch&#x27;s Guide to Psychic Healing&quot; by Yvonne Frost, which argues that the modern Pagan religion Wicca can provide spiritual healing. He joined a Wiccan coven in Toronto and fought his drug habit together with Wiccan priests who performed a banishing ritual. He stopped using drugs and remained an active Pagan.

===Death and legacy===
Close died of emphysema on March 4, 1999, at the Illinois Masonic Hospital (now the Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center) in Chicago, five days before his 65th birthday. He bequeathed his skull to Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre to be used in its productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and specified that he be duly credited in the program as portraying Yorick. Charna Halpern, Close&#x27;s long-time professional partner and the executor of his will, conveyed a skull that she claimed was his, in a high-profile televised ceremony on July 1, 1999. 

A front-page article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in July 2006 questioned the authenticity of the skull, however, citing the presence of teeth (Close was edentulous — toothless — at the time of his death) as well as showing the presence of autopsy marks (Close was never autopsied) among other problems. Halpern stood by her story at the time but admitted three months later, in a &quot;The New Yorker&quot; interview, that she had purchased the skull from a local medical supply company.

Bill Murray organized an early 65th birthday party and wake, shortly before Del&#x27;s anticipated death as he lay on his deathbed in a Chicago hospital, memorialized in a two-part video.

After Close&#x27;s death, his former students in the Upright Citizens Brigade founded the annual Del Close Marathon, three days of continuous improvisation by hundreds of performers at various venues in New York City.

==&quot;The Delmonic Interviews&quot;==
In 2002, Cesar Jaime and Jeff Pacocha produced and directed a film composed of interviews with former students, friends, and collaborators of Del Close. The film documented not only Del&#x27;s life and history, but the impact he had on the people in his life and the art form he helped to create. It is not sold on DVD and was made as a thank you and a tribute to Del, &quot;as a way to allow those that never got to meet or study with him, a chance to understand what he was like.&quot;

The Delmonic Interviews includes interviews with: Charna Halpern (co-founder of Chicago&#x27;s iO Theater), Matt Besser (iO&#x27;s The Family; Upright Citizens Brigade), Rachel Dratch (iO; Second City; Saturday Night Live), Neil Flynn (iO&#x27;s The Family; NBC&#x27;s Scrubs), Susan Messing (iO; Second City; Annoyance Productions), Amy Poehler (Upright Citizens Brigade, Saturday Night Live), and Miles Stroth (iO&#x27;s The Family; Del&#x27;s &quot;Warchief&quot;). The film was shown at several national improv festivals, including the 2004 Chicago Improv Festival, the 2004 Phoenix Improv Festival, the 2002 Del Close Marathon in New York City, and the 2006 LA Improv Festival.

==In print==
Close is featured in an extensive interview in &quot;Something Wonderful Right Away&quot;, a book about the members of the Compass Players and Second City written by Jeffrey Sweet. Originally published in 1978 by Avon, it is currently available from Limelight Editions.

From 1984 to 1988, Del Close wrote comic book stories in First Comics&#x27; &quot;Grimjack&quot;. With regular writer John Ostrander, Close co-wrote Munden&#x27;s Bar stories in &quot;Grimjack&quot; issues #3, 4, 8, 10, 17, 22, 25, 28, 35, and 42. (Close knew Ostrander from the Chicago theater scene.) From 1987 to 1989, also with Ostrander, Close wrote anthology-style horror stories in the DC Comics title &quot;Wasteland&quot;. Several of the stories are allegedly autobiographical; one recounts Close&#x27;s experiences while filming &quot;Beware! The Blob&quot; (1972), and another recalls an encounter with writer L. Ron Hubbard, author of horror and science fiction, and founder of Scientology. Eric Spitznagel wrote about when he heard Close recount his alleged meeting with L.Ron Hubbard, in which Close claimed to have suggested to Hubbard, &quot;Well, if you’re worried about taxes, you should just turn Scientology into a religion&quot; (an anecdote that Spitznagel claimed many others have heard Close recount also). In the 2020 documentary, &quot;For Madmen Only: The Stories of Del Close&quot;, one of the interviewees, Charna Halpern, recounts that she had heard Close say the same anecdote about himself and Hubbard. There have been a number of different individuals that have claimed for themselves, or been attributed with, giving Hubbard the suggestion of turning Scientology into a religion in order to make a lot of money.

In 2004, writer/comedian R. O&#x27;Donnell wrote &quot;My Summer With Del&quot; for &quot;Stop Smiling&quot; magazine #17 Comedian Issue. The feature was an account of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s visits at Del&#x27;s Chicago apartment as well as recounting highlights of their time spent at CrossCurrents, the theater that housed both their comedy groups.

In 2005, Jeff Griggs published &quot;Guru: My Days with Del Close&quot; detailing their friendship during the last two years of Close&#x27;s life. Due to Close&#x27;s poor health (in part caused by long-term alcohol and drug use), Halpern suggested that Griggs run errands with Close. &quot;Guru&quot; gives a particularly detailed and complete picture of Close based on those shared hours. At the beginning of their relationship, Griggs was a student of Del&#x27;s, and the book includes several chapters in which Griggs depicts Close as a teacher. The book has been adapted into a screenplay, and as of 2006 Harold Ramis was attached to direct the script. Ramis (who died in 2014) wanted Bill Murray to play Close. 

Close co-authored the 1994 book &quot;Truth in Comedy: The Manual of Improvisation&quot; (with Charna Halpern and Kim &quot;Howard&quot; Johnson), which outlines techniques now common in longform improvisation and describes the overall structure of &quot;Harold&quot;, which remains a common frame for longer improvisational scenes.
In 2007, Eric Spitznagel wrote an article in the September issue of &quot;The Believer&quot; magazine reflecting on Close&#x27;s life and his propensity for storytelling.

In 2008, Kim &quot;Howard&quot; Johnson published &quot;The Funniest One in the Room: The Lives and Legends of Del Close&quot;, a full-length biography. Johnson himself was a student of Close; the two remained friends until Close&#x27;s death.

In 2022, Bob Odenkirk wrote a memoir &quot;Comedy, Comedy, Comedy, Drama&quot;, which includes excerpts of an interview with Del Close who was influential in the startup of his career.

<text>In Norse mythology, a fylgja (Old Norse: , plural ) is a supernatural being or spirit which accompanies a person in connection to their fate or fortune. They can appear to people in their sleep as dream-women, or appear while awake, often in the disembodied spiritual form of an enemy.

==Etymology==
The word means &quot;to accompany&quot;. The term &quot;fylgja&quot; is typically translated into English as &quot;fetch&quot;, a similar being from Irish folklore. 

The term also has the meaning of &quot;afterbirth, caul&quot;, and it has been argued by Gabriel Turville-Petre (cf. ) that the concept of the supernatural &quot;fylgja&quot; cannot be completely dissociated from this secondary meaning; in fact, there may well be a connection to the &quot;hamr&quot;, referring to the skin used by shapeshifters (, cf. &quot;fjaðrhamr&quot;). 

==Description==
The &quot;fylgja&quot; is a ghost who associates with (or, for a lack of better word, stalks or shadows) a particular individual, and may be characterized as a &quot;guardian spirit&quot;. However, contrary to its name meaning &#x27;follower&#x27;, it generally moves ahead of its host, making a kind of &quot;contact&quot; with the person before they arrive at some key spot. The &quot;fylgja&quot; will, however, follow a person when they are near death.

A &quot;fylgja&quot; is sometimes associated with a particular family or clan, in which case it is called an &quot;&quot; (pl. &#x27;family followers&#x27;). A closely related type of &quot;fylgja&quot; is the &quot;dream woman&quot;, as appears in &quot;Gísla saga&quot; (Cf. below). It is contended that the Icelandic &quot;mar&quot; or &quot;mara&quot; (the folkloric &quot;[night]mare&quot;) is a dream &quot;fylgja&quot; which has strayed from its assigned host and visiting the dreams of others, which tend to be more sinister than when visiting its usual host or ward.

The &quot;fylgja&quot; is said to take on either an animal form or a female human form, and this is due to a conflation of two distinct types of spirits, according to Else Mundal; the term &quot;fylgja&quot;, she argues, was first associated with the animal spirit, then later applied to the woman-spirit type.

=== Placenta origins ===
The Icelandic word &quot;fylgja&quot; can also mean &quot;placenta&quot; or &quot;afterbirth of a child&quot; and the folkloric supernatural connection made between child and afterbirth may be the origins of the &quot;fylgja&quot; as a concept. According to some, the fylgja takes on the form of whatever animal that first showed itself and consumed the newborn baby&#x27;s afterbirths, hence, such creatures take on the forms of such carnivores, as mice, sheep, dogs, foxes, cats, and raptors, birds of prey, or carrion eaters.

===Animal forms===
Thus, while the &quot;fylgja&quot; usually was a female ghost in the shape of a woman, it sometimes took on the shape of animals (also female animals according to Mundal). The animal &quot;fylgjur&quot; typically came in the form of a dog, but also as various other land or even sea creatures,

The particular animal type that the &quot;fylgja&quot; takes on may reflect the character of the person it represents, akin to a totem animal. Hence fox-like &quot;fylgjur&quot; shadowed deceitful people, swan-like forms shadowed beautiful women. Men who were viewed as a leader would often have a fylgja displaying their &quot;true&quot; character. This means that if they had a &quot;tame nature&quot;, their fylgja would typically be an ox, goat, or boar, and if they had an &quot;untame nature&quot;, they would have a fylgja in the shape of an animal like such as a fox, wolf, deer, bear, eagle, falcon, leopard, lion, or a serpent.

The animal fylgja is also said to appear in front of its owner, often in dreams, and offer portents of events to come. As such it is a representation of the future itself, not the character of a person. Like a person&#x27;s fate the fylgja is not changeable, nor can it improve or act on its own.

Fylgjur may also &quot;mark transformations between human and animal&quot; or, in other words, shape shifting. In Egil&#x27;s Saga, there are references to both Egil and Skallagrim transforming into wolves or bears, and there are examples of shape shifting in the Saga of King Hrolf Kraki, where Bodvar Bjarki turns into a bear during a battle as a last stand. These transformations are possibly implied in the saga descriptions of berserkers who transform into animals or display bestial abilities.

Else Mundal has argued that the animal &quot;fylgja&quot; and the woman-ghost type &quot;fylgja&quot; are of different origins, and the solitary animal &quot;fylgja&quot; is actually that individual&#x27;s &quot;alter ego&quot; present since birth, which perishes together when that person dies.
==Occurrences==
Fylgjur usually appear in the form of an animal or a human and commonly appear during sleep, but the sagas relate that they could appear while a person is awake as well, and that seeing one&#x27;s fylgja is an omen of one&#x27;s impending death. When fylgjur appear in the form of women, they are then supposedly guardian spirits for people or clans (ættir). And according to Else Mundal, the female fylgja could also be considered a dís, a ghost or goddess that is attached to fate.

===Sleep and dreams===
Fylgjur commonly appear during sleep.

In &quot;Gísla saga&quot;, the title hero Gísla Surrson is visited upon by two beautiful &quot;fylgjur&quot;, one bearing good omen, and the other one ill-boding and trying to edge him towards violence. These two are dream-women (), as already described, and mentioned as an example of Norse fetches by several authorities. The good &#x27;dream-woman&#x27; and the bad here are also difficult to distinguish from the dísir according to Carolyne Larrington.

It is hardly surprising in medieval context that a dream message should have prognosticating context, giving warning about the person&#x27;s fate. Both Andy Orchard and Rudolf Simek note parallels between the concept of the female guardian hamingja—a personification of a family&#x27;s or individual&#x27;s fortune—and the fylgja.

In another saga example, Atli of Otradalr dreams of a vixen leading a pack of 18 wolves. The ensuing attack was led by the &quot;most wicked wizard in the whole of the region&quot; (&quot;Hávarðar saga Ísfirðings&quot;, i.e. &quot;Saga of Hávarður of Ísafjörður&quot;). This is a &quot;fylgja&quot; or fetch example discussed by G. Turville-Petre, etc.

A rare or even uniquely surviving case of the horse-&quot;fylgja&quot; occurs in &quot;Vatnsdæla saga&quot;. Here, the dreamer () sees himself riding on a red horse, which he optimistically regards as a good portent. But his wife disagrees, and explains the horse to be a &quot;marr&quot; (mentioned above, ≈nightmare, mare), and is a man&#x27;s fetch, furthermore, the red color betrays bloody-mindedness. She unsuccessfully tries to dissuade him from attending the meeting to select the chieftain (goði), and though Ingólfr is elected, he is immediately killed by an assassinator. 

=== Waking appearances ===
The sagas also relate that they could appear while a person is awake as well, and that seeing one&#x27;s fylgja is an omen of one&#x27;s impending death. 

Thus in &quot;Hallfreðar saga&quot;, its protagonist Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld (&quot;the troublesome-poet&quot;) had a vision of a woman clad in armour whom he recognized to be his own &quot;fylgjukona&quot; and he perceived that her appearance signified his imminent death aboard the ship.

==Folktales==
===Skotta and móri===

In Jón Árnason&#x27;s classification, he placed the &quot;&quot;fylgja&quot; branch of stories under the broader class of &quot;draugr&quot;&quot; (&#x27;ghost&#x27; or &quot;goblin stories&quot; ); and under this &quot;fylgja&quot; branch (&quot;&quot; or &quot;followers&quot;) he collected many stories of ghosts which were of the female &quot;skotta&quot; and male &quot;móri&quot; types. However, modern commentators have distinguished the &quot;móri&quot; and the &quot;skotta&quot; as wicked ghosts, which are separate from the &quot;fylgja&quot;.

The name &quot;skotta&quot; is explained from their odd habit of wearing the &quot;&quot;, the woman&#x27;s headdress Icelandic national costume: instead of wearing it curved forward as she is supposed to, she wears a brown-red &quot;faldur&quot; curled backward like a tail (&quot;skott&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;). She also wears red stockings and sucks her fingers, but, otherwise, she is dressed properly and conducts herself normally.

Just as the &quot;skotta&quot; favored wearing a brown[ish] &quot;faldur&quot;, the male &quot;móri&quot; were also characterized by their wearing brown () clothing, hence this particular appellation. Though the &quot;móri&quot; was also known by other names such as &quot;lalli&quot;, or &quot;goggur&quot; or by other kennings.

<text>The hamingja was a type of female guardian spirit in Norse mythology. It was believed that she accompanied a person and decided their luck and happiness. Consequently, the name was also used to indicate happiness, and that is what it means in modern Icelandic. When a person died, the hamingja passed to a beloved family member and thus accompanied a family for several generations, continuing to influence their fortunes. It was even possible to lend one&#x27;s own hamingja to a friend, as happened when Hjalti Skeggiason was about to leave on a perilous voyage and asked Olaf II of Norway to lend him his hamingja.

It usually appears during sleep in the form of an animal, but it can also be the spirit of a sleeping person who appears in the form of an animal, as Bödvar Bjarki in the saga of Hrólfr Kraki.

In Norse mythology, &quot;hamingja&quot; (Old Norse &quot;luck&quot;) refers to two concepts:

* the personification of the good fortune or luck of an individual or family, 
* the altered appearance of shape-shifters.

Both Andy Orchard and Rudolf Simek note parallels between the concept of the hamingja and the fylgja. Luck may be transferred to a descendant of the owner, or to a member of a tribe for a perilous journey, it accords wealth, success and power, and it accrues over a life time. Sometimes hamingja is used to denote honor.

<text>Forest Guerrillas () were an East Karelian resistance movement that was created officially on 14 October 1921. There were around 3,000 Forest Guerrillas in total during the East Karelian Uprising as a Karelian and Finnish resistance movement against Bolshevik Russia, aiming for an East Karelian state with independence from Russia, and in some occasions unification or cooperation with Finland. Most of the soldiers of the Forest Guerrillas were from White Karelia, Repola &amp; Porajärvi and Olonets Karelia. The heraldry of the East Karelian Forest Guerrillas was created by Akseli Gallen-Kallela.

== Origins ==

Near the end of 1921, company-sized militia groups were being formed in East Karelia to fight against the Bolsheviks, due to the official abandonment of Finnish support for the cause of Karelian Independence following the signing of the Tartu Peace Treaty between the Finns and Russians. These militias would be united into the &quot;East Karelian Forest Guerrilla Regiment&quot; on 14 October 1921, following a meeting between around 200 representatives from all around Karelia at . The Forest Guerrilla Regiment was sized around 3,000 men strong. In that very meeting held, Ukki Väinämöinen was chosen as the spiritual leader of the Forest Guerrillas, as he was a major proponent and a key figure in Karelian Nationalism, with also serving a commanding role in the East Karelian Forest Guerrilla Regiment, with (nom de guerre: Ilmarinen) being chosen as the commander-in-chief of the Forest Guerrillas.

== Structure ==
The political body of the Forest Guerrillas was the Karelian United Government. The body dealing with foreign affairs of East Karelia, mainly asking for help and aid from the Western powers, such as Finland, the United States, Estonia and Poland, was called the Foreign Commission of Karelia. The Forest Guerrillas were divided into three separate units, which were respectively called: the East Karelian Forest Guerrilla Regiment, the Viena Regiment and the Repola Battalion.

== Forest Guerrillas at war ==

=== Advances &amp; victories ===

On 11 December 1921, the Repola Battalion launched an offensive attack, capturing Repola and forcing the Bolshevik Russians to retreat. With the Forest Guerrillas following closely in pursuit, capturing on 15 December 1921, and the pursuit continued until , where the Bolsheviks were encircled and beaten with significant losses. The pursuit tactics which the Forest Guerrillas were using were efficient, until they were forced to battle the Bolsheviks at and , until a tough battle on Christmas night when Porajärvi was captured for the East Karelians.

The Forest Guerrillas had captured around 60,000 square kilometers from the Bolshevik Russians at their highest extent, and there was lots of public support behind them, as Karelian nationalism and Pan-Finnicism were increasingly popular in the rural areas of Karelia.

The Red Army had begun a counter-offensive against the Forest Guerrillas on 5 November, beginning an attack towards the village of . The Forest Guerrillas had set up defensive positions upon hearing the news and opened fire over the Red Army group traveling over the frozen lake at Uskela. The Forest Guerrillas had defeated the Bolsheviks in their first major encounter.

=== Forest Guerrilla retreat &amp; dissolution ===
On 22 January 1922, the Bolsheviks had begun an all-out counter-offensive against the Forest Guerrillas, moving towards Kokkosalmi. The ensuing battle between the Forest Guerrillas and Bolsheviks was fierce, with both sides taking major casualties. The Forest Guerrillas only had around 800 men at their disposal to defend the village, and they had been blockaded by the Bolsheviks. The Karelian Forest Guerrillas retreated towards through a minor gap in the enemy blockade.

The Viena Regiment reorganized with help from the Oulanga Company at Sohjananvirta, and on 26 January they came into contact with the Bolsheviks, and a battle across a frozen river ensued with the Forest Guerrillas holding off the Bolshevik forces until the next day, when they once again retreated, this time retreating to . On 5 February 1922, they were forced into a defensive battle with the Bolsheviks, where they ultimately retreated across the Finnish-Russian Border into Kainuu, due to the vast Red Army superiority in manpower and the reason that the Forest Guerrillas were lacking ammunition and food supplies.

<text>The Great Waltz is a musical conceived by Hassard Short with a book by Moss Hart and lyrics by Desmond Carter, using themes by Johann Strauss I and Johann Strauss II. It is based on a pasticcio by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Julius Bittner called &quot;Walzer aus Wien&quot;, first performed in Vienna in 1930. The story of the musical is loosely based on the real-life feud between the older and younger Strauss, allegedly because of the father&#x27;s jealousy of his son&#x27;s greater talent.

&quot;The Great Waltz&quot; debuted on Broadway at the Center Theatre on September 22, 1934 and ran for 289 performances. The production was directed by Hassard Short and presented by Max Gordon, with choreography by Albertina Rasch, settings by Albert Johnson and costumes by Doris Zinkeisen together with Marion Claire, Marie Burke and Guy Robertson. The musical was made into a motion picture by MGM in 1938 with a screenplay and new lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. 

In 1949 impresario Edwin Lester hired Robert Wright and George Forrest to adapt Strauss&#x27;s German lyrics and music for a production at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera starring Dorothy Kirsten and John Charles Thomas. This version was used for a London revival that opened at the Drury Lane Theatre on July 9, 1970 and ran for 605 performances. It was also used for a 1972 film remake.

<doc id="935892" wikidata="Q2075102" url="?curid=935892" title="Blue Hawaii">
<text>Blue Hawaii is a 1961 American musical romantic comedy drama film directed by Norman Taurog and starring Elvis Presley. The screenplay by Hal Kanter was nominated by the Writers Guild of America in 1962 in the category of Best Written American Musical. The film opened at number two in box-office receipts for that week and, despite mixed reviews from critics, finished as the 10th top-grossing film of 1961 and 14th for 1962 in the &quot;Variety&quot; national box office survey, earning $5 million. The film won a fourth place prize Laurel Award in the category of Top Musical of 1961.

==Plot==
Having been released from the Army, Chadwick &quot;Chad&quot; Gates is eager to return to Hawaii with his surfboard, his native Hawaiian beach friends, and his mixed-race girlfriend Maile Duval. His mother, Sarah Lee, wants him to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and take over management at the Great Southern Hawaiian Fruit Company, the family business, but Chad is reluctant and goes to work as a tour guide at his girlfriend&#x27;s agency. His slightly scatter-brained boss is Mr. Chapman.

The first clients Chad has are an attractive school teacher, Abigail Prentice, and four teenage female students. One of the students, 17-year-old Ellie Corbett, seems self-centered and doesn&#x27;t get along with the other three, but she becomes smitten with Chad. Chad&#x27;s girlfriend, Maile, becomes jealous of Abigail, who is quite fond of Chad. After Ellie&#x27;s flirtatious ways with another tourist cause a wild fight to erupt in a restaurant, Mr. Chapman fires Chad. Maile quits her job in protest. Maile and Chad independently continue guiding Abigail and the four youths, taking them to Kaua&#x27;i.

One night Ellie attempts to seduce Chad in his hotel room, but he refuses her advances; at the same moment, Maile pays a surprise visit to the hotel. Ellie despondently flees in a stolen jeep, intending to drown herself in the ocean. Before she can, Chad pulls her out, attempts to speak to her, but then decides to punish her with a spanking. In the next scene, the girls, including Ellie, are having breakfast. Ellie is now pleasant, friendly and well-mannered, and jokes about the spanking. Meanwhile, Abigail has found romance with Jack Kelman, a longtime business partner of Chad&#x27;s father. With Jack&#x27;s help, Chad and his father resolve their differences about Chad&#x27;s future.

Chad and Maile form their own tourism business—Gates of Hawaii—and begin arrangements to provide tourist services for his father&#x27;s large network of fruit salesmen in the U.S. and Canada. The film ends with Chad&#x27;s and Maile&#x27;s lavish outdoor wedding.

==Production==
&quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; was the first of three Elvis films shot in Hawaii, followed by &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot; in 1962 and &quot;Paradise, Hawaiian Style&quot; in 1965. Producer Hal B. Wallis was keen to put Presley in a film that showed how the army affected a man. Actress Juliet Prowse, who had starred with Presley in &quot;GI Blues&quot;, was approached to be his love interest again. But after her demands were put forward, Paramount decided to drop her for the role, choosing Joan Blackman instead. Presley was apparently so pale before shooting that Wallis personally recommended a brand of tanning lamp to darken his skin. The film was announced in the fall of 1960 as &quot;Hawaii Beach Boy&quot;. At the time, film producer Walter Mirisch had a film titled &quot;Hawaii&quot; in production, and he was upset that Wallis had chosen such a similar name.

Presley arrived in Hawaii on March 18, 1961, to prepare for a charity concert he was giving on March 25 to raise funds for the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. He arrived at the recording studio on March 21 to start recording the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Three weeks later, location filming had finished, including scenes at Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head, Mount Tantalus, and Hanauma Bay, a volcanic crater that is open to the sea, near the bedroom community of Hawaii Kai, a few miles away from Waikiki. After location filming, the crew returned to the Paramount lot to finish other scenes for the film. Presley relaxed during filming by giving karate demonstrations with his friend and employee, Red West, which resulted in Presley&#x27;s fingers becoming bruised and swollen. Wallis warned the female stars of the film to avoid parties Presley hosted because they were turning up for shooting looking tired.

Wallis used the box-office returns from &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; to finance an upcoming Wallis film, 1964&#x27;s &quot;Becket&quot;, starring Richard Burton and Peter O&#x27;Toole.

Presley was 26 at the time this film was released, and a not yet 36-year-old Angela Lansbury played his character&#x27;s mother. Nancy Walters, who was cast as the older schoolteacher, was in reality only 18 months older than Presley.

Much of the film was shot on location at the Coco Palms Resort on the east coast of Kauai.

Although it is mentioned in the film that Chad&#x27;s parents live in Kāhala, one of the most expensive and exclusive areas of Honolulu in 1961, the view from their &quot;lanai&quot; (porch or terrace) shows Diamond Head as it appears from Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. In actuality, Kāhala is on the other side of Diamond Head from Waikiki.

Several scenes were filmed in and around Waikiki Beach, including the opening driving scenes and the office scene across the street from the &quot;International Market&quot;. The scenes in which Chad&#x27;s clients stay in a hotel and in which he picks up his tour group – as well as those on the beach where he spends time with Maile – were all filmed on the property now known as the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki Beach.

==Reception==
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;blandly uneventful&quot; with a &quot;nonsensical and harmless&quot; plot, though he wrote that Presley &quot;delivers the songs and rhythmical spasms right on schedule. We counted fourteen tunes, about half of them replete with ukulele trimmings and exotic, weaving dancers. One of them, a number called &#x27;Beach Boy Blues,&#x27; is nifty, and Presley delivers it accordingly. No kidding.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Hal Kanter&#x27;s breezy screenplay, from a story by Allan Weiss, is the slim, but convenient, foundation around which Wallis and staff have erected a handsome, picture-postcard production crammed with typical South Seas musical hulaballoo ... Under Norman Taurog&#x27;s broad direction, Presley, in essence, is playing himself—a role sure to delight his ardent fans.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; graded the film &quot;Fair&quot;, adding: &quot;As is the custom in a Presley production, the crooner-gyrater dominates the running time of the film. That is why, it is more the pity, now that he has so many films under his acting belt that he still continues to deliver such an embarrassingly poor performance.&quot; John L. Scott of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;does a lot for the &#x27;paradise of the Pacific,&#x27; showing its foamy waves, palm trees, luaus and a couple of plush hotels, but not very much for Elvis&#x27; fans (what age bracket does he appeal to now?) ... One of these days Elvis will play a straight role with substance, and we&#x27;ll definitely find out whether he can act or not.&quot;

==Accolades==
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs: 
** &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; – Nominated

==Soundtrack==

Presley&#x27;s remake of the title song introduced it to an audience too young to remember Bing Crosby&#x27;s original hit version.

The soundtrack album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1961 in the category of Best Sound Track Album or Recording of Original Cast from a Motion Picture or Television.

The soundtrack featured the hit song &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; sung by Elvis, which is certified Platinum by the RIAA, for U.S. sales in excess of one million copies. The song peaked at No. 2 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Billboard Hot 100 and hit No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart for six weeks, as well as topping the British charts in 1962.

As of 4 March 2024, the song was the most streamed Elvis Presley song with total streams on Spotify totalled at 836,193,249 and was on course to be the first Elvis Presley song streamed on one billion occasions. Youtube streams on the Elvis Presley channel totalled in excess of 400 million on the same date.

<text>Valentin Alexandrovich Serov (; – 5 December 1911) was a Russian painter and one of the premier portrait artists of his era.

==Life and work==

===Youth and education===
Serov was born in Saint Petersburg, son of the Russian composer and music critic Alexander Serov and his wife and former student Valentina Serova, also a composer in her own right. Raised in a highly artistic milieu he was encouraged to pursue his talents by his parents and in his childhood he studied in Paris and Moscow under Ilya Repin and in the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts (1880–1885) under Pavel Chistyakov. Serov&#x27;s early creativity was sparked by the realistic art of Repin and strict pedagogical system of Chistyakov. Further influences on Serov were the old master paintings he viewed in the museums of Russia and Western Europe, friendships with Mikhail Vrubel and (later) Konstantin Korovin, and the creative atmosphere of the Abramtsevo Colony, to which he was closely connected.

===Early works===

The greatest works of Serov&#x27;s early period were portraits: &quot;The Girl with Peaches&quot; (1887), and &quot;The Girl Covered by the Sun&quot; (1888), both in the Tretyakov Gallery. In these paintings Serov concentrated on spontaneity of perception of the model and nature. In the development of light and color, the complex harmony of reflections, the sense of atmospheric saturation, and the fresh picturesque perception of the world, there appeared the features of early Russian impressionism (though Serov was not yet aware of works of French impressionists at the time of making those paintings).

===Portraiture and success===
From 1890 on, the portrait became the basic genre in Serov&#x27;s art. It was in this field that his early style would become apparent, the paintings notable for the psychologically pointed characteristics of his subjects. Serov&#x27;s favorite models were actors, artists, and writers, such as Konstantin Korovin (1891), Isaac Levitan (1893), Nikolai Leskov (1894), and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1898)—all in the Tretyakov Gallery.
Initially abstaining from the polychromatic, brightly colored painting style of the 1880s, Serov often preferred a dominant scale of black-grey or brown tones. Impressionistic features appeared sometimes in composite construction of a portrait, or to capture a sense of spontaneous movement. As in the work of his contemporaries John Singer Sargent and Anders Zorn, the impressionism is not doctrinaire, but derives as much from the study of Hals and Velázquez as from modern theory. Receiving wide popularity, in 1894 Serov joined with the Peredvizhniki (The Itinerants), and took on important commissions, among them portraits of grand duke Pavel Alexandrovich, (1897, Tretyakov Gallery), S.M. Botkin, 1899, and Felix Yusupov, 1903 as well as Princess Olga Orlova (these in the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg). In these truthful, compositionally skillful, and picturesque executions in the grand manner, Serov consistently used linear-rhythmic drawing coupled with decorative color combinations.

At the same time, he developed a contrasting direction: he frequently produced intimate, heartfelt, chamber portraits, mainly of children and women. In portraits of children Serov aspired to capture pose and gesture, to reveal and emphasize a spontaneity of internal movement, sincere cleanliness and clearness of attitude of the child (&quot;Children&quot;, 1899, Russian Museum; &quot;Mika Morozov&quot;, 1901, Tretyakov gallery). Serov frequently called upon various graphic techniques—watercolors, pastels, lithographs and so forth. Figures in Serov&#x27;s portraits gradually became more and more graphically refined and economical, particularly during the late period (Vasily Kachalov, 1908, Tamara Karsavina, 1909; numerous figures from Ivan Krylov&#x27;s fables, 1895–1911). From 1890 to 1900 Serov produced many landscape compositions on country themes, in which the artistic direction took a romantic turn.

===Marriage and family===

Serov married Olga Trubnikova in 1889. His wife and his children were the subject of many of his works. Notably, his painting &quot;Children&quot; was of his sons Yura and Sasha. His children were Olga, Alexander (Sacha), George (Yura), Michael and Anton.

===Late work===

During his late period, which began in 1900, Serov was a member of &quot;The World of art&quot;, an influential Russian art association and magazine which grew, in part, out of dissatisfaction with the Itinerants movement. At the start of the 20th century, Serov was at a stylistic turning point: features of impressionism disappeared from his work, and his modernistic style developed, but the characteristic truthful and realistic comprehension of the nature of his subjects remained constant. In the early 20th century Serov created heroic portrait images; within the genre of the fashionable portrait, Serov focused on the dramatic depiction of creative artists, writers, actors, and musicians of import: Maxim Gorki&#x27;s portraits (1904, A.M. Gorki&#x27;s museum, Moscow); Maria Yermolova (1905) and Feodor Chaliapin (charcoal, 1905), both in the Tretyakov Gallery; and Helena Roerich (1909).

Serov&#x27;s democratic beliefs were clearly shown during the Revolution from 1905 to 1907: he depicted a number of satirical figures exposing chastisers. A full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts since 1903, in 1905 he resigned as a gesture of protest against the execution of striking workers and their families on 9 January, Bloody Sunday. His late creativity found expression in historical painting (&quot;Peter II and Elizabeth Petrovna departing for the hunt&quot;, 1900, Russian Museum), and depth of comprehension of the historical maintenance of an epoch (&quot;Peter I&quot;, distemper, 1907, Tretyakov Gallery).

The last years of Serov&#x27;s life were marked by works on themes from classical mythology. While addressing images from the ancient tradition, Serov endowed classical subject matter with a personal interpretation.

===Death===
Valentin Serov died in Moscow on 5 December 1911, from stenocardia (an acute form of angina) that eventually led to cardiac arrest, ending in heart failure due to severe complications. He was buried at the Donskoye Cemetery. The Soviets had his remains exhumed and reburied at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The best works of Serov are among the greatest of Russian realistic art. He taught in the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture from 1897 to 1909), and among his students were Pavel Kuznetsov, N. N. Sapunov, Martiros Saryan, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, N. P. Ulyanov, and Konstantin Yuon.

A 2016 exhibition of Serov&#x27;s work at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow attracted record crowds which queued for long hours in freezing temperatures. Following the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the crowd swelled to such an extent that one of the museum&#x27;s doors was broken down. Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky ordered the exhibition—and the gallery&#x27;s opening hours—to be extended, and a field canteen was deployed to provide the people who were standing in the lines with buckwheat porridge and hot tea.

A minor planet, 3547 Serov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1978, is named after him.

<doc id="935895" wikidata="Q582584" url="?curid=935895" title="First Anglo-Sikh war">
<text>The first Anglo-Sikh war was fought between the Sikh Empire and the British East India Company in 1845 and 1846 around the Ferozepur district of Punjab. It resulted in the defeat and partial subjugation of the Sikh empire and cession of Jammu &amp; Kashmir as a separate princely state under British suzerainty.

==Background and causes of the war==
The Sikh kingdom of Punjab was expanded and consolidated by Maharajah Ranjit Singh during the early years of the nineteenth century, about the same time as the British-controlled territories were advanced by conquest or annexation to the borders of the Punjab.

When shown the map of India, Maharaja Ranjit Singh said, &quot;What does the red colour stand for?&quot; The cartographer replied &quot;Your Majesty, red marks the extent of British possessions.&quot; The Maharaja scanned the map with his single eye and saw nearly the whole of Hindustan except the Punjab painted red. He turned to his courtiers and remarked: ‘Ek roz sab lal ho jaiga— one day it will all be red.&#x27; It was said that his prophecy was going to be fulfilled.

Ranjit Singh maintained a policy of wary friendship with the British, ceding some territory south of the Sutlej River, while at the same time building up his military forces both to deter aggression by the British and to wage war against the Afghans. He hired American and European mercenary soldiers to train his army, and also incorporated contingents of Hindus and Muslims into his forces.

===Events in the Punjab===
Maharaja Ranjit Singh died in 1839. After his death, his kingdom began to fall into disorder. Ranjit&#x27;s unpopular legitimate son, Kharak Singh, was removed from power within a few months, and later died in prison under mysterious circumstances. It was widely believed that he was poisoned. He was replaced by his able but estranged son Kanwar Nau Nihal Singh, who also died within a few months in suspicious circumstances, after being injured by a falling archway at the Lahore Fort while returning from his father&#x27;s cremation. At the time, two major factions within the Punjab were contending for power and influence; the Sikh Sindhanwalias and the Hindu Dogras. Sher Singh was crowned Maharaja of the Sikh Empire in January 1841, with Dhian Singh Dogra as his prime minister.

The army expanded rapidly in the aftermath of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s death, from 29,000 (with 192 guns) in 1839 to over 80,000 in 1845 as landlords and their retainers took up arms. It proclaimed itself to be the embodiment of the Sikh nation. Its regimental panchayats (committees) formed an alternative power source within the kingdom, declaring that Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s ideal of the Sikh commonwealth had been revived, with the Sikhs as a whole assuming all executive, military and civil authority in the state, which British observers decried as a &quot;dangerous military democracy&quot;. British representatives and visitors in the Punjab described the regiments as preserving &quot;puritanical&quot; order internally, but also as being in a perpetual state of mutiny or rebellion against the central Durbar (court).
Maharajah Sher Singh was unable to meet the pay demands of the army, although he reportedly lavished funds on a degenerate court. In September 1843 he was murdered by his cousin, an officer of the army, Ajit Singh Sindhanwalia. The Dogras took their revenge on those responsible, and Jind Kaur, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s youngest widow, became regent for her infant son Duleep Singh. After the vizier Hira Singh was killed, while attempting to flee the capital with loot from the royal treasury (toshkana), by troops under Sham Singh Attariwala, Jind Kaur&#x27;s brother Jawahar Singh became vizier in December 1844. In 1845 he arranged the assassination of Pashaura Singh, who presented a threat to Duleep Singh. For this, he was called to account by the army. Despite attempts to bribe the army he was butchered in September 1845 in the presence of Jind Kaur and Duleep Singh.

Jind Kaur publicly vowed revenge against her brother&#x27;s murderers. She remained regent. Lal Singh became vizier, and Tej Singh became commander of the army. Sikh historians have stressed that both these men were prominent in the Dogra faction. Originally Hindus from outside of Punjab, both had converted to Sikhism in 1818.

===British actions===
Immediately after the death of Ranjit Singh, the British East India Company had begun increasing its military strength, particularly in the regions adjacent to the Punjab, establishing a military cantonment at Ferozepur, only a few miles from the Sutlej River which marked the frontier between British-ruled India and the Punjab. In 1843, they conquered and annexed Sindh, to the south of the Punjab, in a move which many British people regarded as cynical and ignoble. This did not gain the British any respect in the Punjab and increased suspicions of British motives.

The actions and attitudes of the British, under Governor General Lord Ellenborough and his successor, Sir Henry Hardinge, are disputed. By most British accounts, their main concern was that the Sikh army, without strong leadership to restrain them, was a serious threat to British territories along the border. Sikh and Indian historians have countered that the military preparations made by these Governor-Generals were offensive in nature; for example, they prepared bridging trains (prefabricated bridges) and siege gun batteries, which would be unlikely to be required in a purely defensive operation.

Nevertheless, the unconcealed and seemingly aggressive British military build-up at the borders had the effect of increasing tension within the Punjab and the Sikh Army.

== Status of combatants ==

=== Khalsa Army ===

The army under Ranjit Singh had expanded from around 35,000 troops in the 1820s to over 100,000 by 1845. In 1822 Ranjit Singh decided to base his army on the French model and this process was complete by the time of his death in 1839.

The first brigade of the army was the Fauj-i-Khas (Royal Army), which contained 3,176 infantry, 1,667 cavalry and 34 guns. The brigades of the Fauj-i-ain were modelled on that of the Khas and this force had grown from 35,000 in 1838 to 70,000 by 1845 with seven divisions being created in 1844/1845 from the existing troops.

The Sikh cavalry, though no longer the preferred branch, remained a well-disciplined force with 6,235 cavalrymen in 1845 with 2 regiments of lancers, 2 of cuirassiers, and 6 dragoon regiments. There was also 22,000 Fauj-i-sowar which consisted of irregular cavalry deemed unsuitable for fighting an organised enemy but well-suited for chasing a routed enemy and conducting guerilla warfare.

The artillery was large though unstandardised, increasing from 40 guns in 1808 to 381 by 1845, with an additional 388 swivel guns. Some of the artillery units had been organised and trained by European mercenaries. The British unwisely underestimated the Khalsa&#x27;s artillery prior to the outbreak of war.

There also existed the Jargirdar Fauj. This compoment of the Khalsa Army was the feudal army provided by the nobility of the state. It numbered 55,000. Gulab Singh&#x27;s army in particular contained between 12,000 and 17,000 infantry and cavalry as well as 94 guns. Additionally, there were the Nihangs; 1,000 religious warriors who fought primarily as mounted infantry.

Although the leaders and principal units of the army were Sikhs, there were also Punjabi, Pakhtun and Kashmiri infantry units. In total the Khalsa army could count on approximately 153,000 regular and irregular soldiers. It was however led by Lal Singh who, with Tej Singh, betrayed the Sikhs during the course of the war. The two generals were regularly supplying information and even receiving instructions from British officers.

An alternative estimate of the troops is given by Singh who states it contained in 1845 on the eve of war 53,576 regular infantry 6,235 regular cavalry, 16,292 irregular cavalry and 10,698 gunners this not including the tens of thousands of Jargirdari Fauj.

=== British Army ===
The British army in India at the time generally consisted of three types: the regular units of the British Army (sometimes referred to in India as &quot;Queen&#x27;s&quot; troops), who were used as the shock formations of the military in India, which in combination with disease resulted in them being almost permanently understrength; the European troops raised by the East India Company, who represented a tiny proportion of the troops present; the native Indian troops (sepoys) who formed the vast majority. 74 battalions of Sepoys in the Bengal Army alone existed at the commencement of hostilities in addition to 8 light and lancer cavalry regiments and 18 Irregular cavalry regiments. The Sepoys were often used as garrisons and baggage train guards to leave the fighting to the European soldiers predominantly. In most infantry and cavalry brigades, there was usually one British unit to every three or four Bengal units. The artillery of the Bengal Army contained 3 brigades and 5 battalions. Most of the artillery which took part in the war consisted of light guns from the elite Bengal Horse Artillery.

Despite an overwhelming superiority in overall numbers the British struggled to assemble an army above 40,000 for the campaign and even at the end of the war fewer than 25,000 soldiers were actively fighting.

The army was commanded by Sir Hugh Gough, the Commander in Chief of the Bengal Army, who was accompanied by Sir Henry Hardinge, the British Governor General of Bengal, who placed himself beneath Gough in the military chain of command. Gough was an aggressive commander who was unwilling to await for reinforcements. This almost led to disaster despite the open treachery of the two Sikh generals.

==Outbreak and course of the war==

After mutual demands and accusations between the Sikh Durbar and the East India Company, diplomatic relations were broken. An East India Company army began marching towards Ferozepur, where a division was already stationed.
In response to the British move, the Sikh army began crossing the Sutlej on 11 December 1845. The Sikhs claimed they were only moving into Sikh possessions (specifically the village of Moran, whose ownership was disputed) on the east side of the river, but the move was regarded by the British as clearly hostile and they declared war.

===Ladwa battles===

====Battle of Wadni Fort====
After Raja Gurdit Singh&#x27;s death, his son Ajit Singh succeeded him. Ajit Singh upgraded his fort at Ladwa to face the danger of the British. During the First Sikh war in 1845, he fought on the side of the Sikh army against the British. He was defeated. The Sikh defenders of Wudnee surrendered on 30 December after the Sikh defeat at Ferozeshah prevented the Sikh army reinforcing them.

====Battle of Phillaur Fort====

This battle was the last fought by the Raja of Ladwa (alt. spelt as &quot;Ladva&quot;), Ajit Singh. The fort was designed by Dewan Mohkam Chand, with the assistance of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s French and Italian generals. It was constructed as a response to the British, who built Lodhi fort in nearby Ludhiana. The fort&#x27;s architecture has a distinct European character, with channels dug out along the boundary of the fort, watchtowers on the two gateways, four bastions on four nooks and high walls around the fort. Ajit Singh of Ladwa won this battle due to this fort.

===Lahore battles===

====Battle of Mudki====

The battle of Mudki was fought on 18 December 1845. An army under Tej Singh crossed the Sutlej and advanced against the British outpost at Ferozepur, although they did not attempt to attack or surround it. Another force under Lal Singh clashed with Gough&#x27;s and Hardinge&#x27;s advancing army at the Battle of Mudki late on 18 December. The British won an untidy encounter battle, suffering heavy casualties.

====Battle of Ferozeshah====
The battle of Ferozeshah was fought on 21 December 1845.

After the battle of Mudki, Gough&#x27;s army came in sight of the large Sikh entrenchment at Ferozeshah on 19 December. Gough wished to attack at once, but Hardinge used his position as Governor General to overrule him and order him to wait for the division from Ferozepur to arrive. When they appeared late on 21 December, Gough attacked in the few hours of daylight left. The well-served Sikh artillery caused heavy casualties among the British, and their infantry fought desperately. On the other hand, the elite of the Sikh army, the irregular cavalry or ghodachadas (alt. gorracharra, horse-mounted), were comparatively ineffective against Gough&#x27;s infantry and cavalry as they had been kept from the battlefield by Lal Singh.

By nightfall, some of Gough&#x27;s army had fought their way into the Sikh positions, but other units had been driven back in disorder. Hardinge expected a defeat on the following day and ordered the state papers at Mudki to be burned in this event. However, on the following morning, the British and Bengal Army units rallied and drove the Sikhs from the rest of their fortifications. Lal Singh had made no effort to rally or reorganise his army.

At this point, Tej Singh&#x27;s army appeared. Once again, Gough&#x27;s exhausted army faced defeat and disaster, but Tej Singh inexplicably withdrew, claiming that British cavalry and artillery which were withdrawing to replenish ammunition were actually making an outflanking move.

Operations temporarily halted, mainly because Gough&#x27;s army was exhausted and required rest and reinforcements.

====Battle of Baddowal====

The battle of Budhowal was fought on 21 January 1846. Ranjodh Singh Majithia was the son of Desa Singh Majithia, one of the most able ministers under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He commanded a large army, (10,000 infantry and some regular cavalry with sixty guns) and crossed the Sutlej in force and was joined by Ajit Singh of Ladwa. They marched towards Ludhiana and burned a portion of the British cantonment. Sir Harry Smith (afterwards Governor of Cape Colony), who was sent to relieve Ludhiana, marched eastwards from Ferozepur, keeping a few miles away from the Sutlej.

On learning of the Sikh strength, and receiving further orders from Gough, Smith instead force-marched his troops via Jagraon, collecting a British regiment there, to reach Ludhiana ahead of the Sikh main body. On 21 January, as he left Baddowal, the Sikh irregular cavalry (the &quot;Gorchurras&quot;) continually attacked his rearguards. They captured most of Smith&#x27;s baggage animals (mules, bullocks and elephants), and cut down any straggling troops. Nevertheless, Smith succeeded in reaching Ludhiana, with his troops exhausted. A brigade of troops from Delhi, including two Gurkha battalions, reinforced him.

==== Battle of Aliwal ====
The battle of Aliwal was fought on 28 January 1846. After resting his troops, Smith once again advanced to Baddowal. The Sikhs had withdrawn to Aliwal on the Sutlej, awaiting reinforcements. On 28 January, Smith advanced against them, cautiously at first. Finding a weak point in the Sikh position, he won a model victory which eliminated the Sikh bridgehead and captured almost all Ranjur Singh&#x27;s artillery and his army&#x27;s baggage and equipment.

====Battle of Sobraon====

The battle of Sobraon was fought on 10 February 1846. The Sikhs had been temporarily dismayed by their defeats and by their commanders&#x27; inaction, but rallied when fresh units and leaders, including Sham Singh Attariwala, joined them, and Maharani Jind Kaur exhorted 500 selected officers to make renewed efforts.

Gough had intended to attack the Sikh army in its entrenchments at Sobraon as soon as Smith&#x27;s division rejoined from Ludhiana, but Hardinge forced him to wait until a heavy artillery train had arrived. At last, he moved forward early on 10 February. The start of the battle was delayed by heavy fog, but as it lifted, 35 British heavy guns and howitzers opened fire. The Sikh cannon replied. The bombardment went on for two hours without much effect on the Sikh defences. Gough was told that his heavy guns were running short of ammunition and is alleged to have replied, &quot;Thank God! Then I&#x27;ll be at them with the bayonet.&quot;

Two British divisions under Harry Smith and Major General Sir Walter Gilbert made feint attacks on the Sikh left, while another division under Major General Robert Henry Dick made the main attack on the Sikh right, where the defences were of soft sand and were lower and weaker than the rest of the line. (It is believed that Lal Singh had supplied this information to Major Henry Lawrence, the Political Agent at Gough&#x27;s headquarters.) Nevertheless, Dick&#x27;s division was driven back by Sikh counter-attacks after initially gaining footholds within the Sikh lines. Dick himself was killed. As the British fell back, some frenzied Sikh soldiers attacked British wounded left in the ditch in front of the entrenchments, enraging the British soldiers.

The British, Gurkhas and Bengal regiments renewed their attacks along the entire front of the entrenchment, and broke through at several points. On the vulnerable Sikh right, engineers blew a breach in the fortifications and British cavalry and horse artillery pushed through it to engage the Sikhs in the centre of their position. Tej Singh had left the battlefield early. It is alleged in many Sikh accounts that he deliberately weakened the pontoon bridge, casting loose the boat at its centre, or that he ordered his own artillery on the west bank to fire on the bridge on the pretext of preventing British pursuit. British accounts claim that the bridge simply broke under the weight of the numbers of soldiers trying to retreat across it, having been weakened by the swollen river. Whichever account is correct, the bridge broke, trapping nearly 20,000 of the Sikh Khalsa Army on the east bank.

None of the trapped Sikh soldiers attempted to surrender. Many detachments, including one led by Sham Singh Attariwala, fought to the death. Some Sikhs rushed forward to attack the British regiments sword in hand; others tried to ford or swim the river. British horse artillery lined the bank of the river and continued to fire into the crowds in the water. By the time the firing ceased, the Sikhs had lost between 8,000 and 10,000 men. The British had also captured 67 guns.

===Kangra battles===
====Siege of Kangra Fort====
This siege was fought from mid-April to 28 May 1846. It was a six-week long siege of the Kangra fortress. Lawrence reached the fort on 3 May 1846. This was the only battle fought between the Sikh forces of Kangra and the British. The British controlled the valley after defeating them and the fort.

===Mohali Battles===
====Battle of Sohana====
Akali Hanuman Singh along with 500 troops were heading for Ghuram when they were attacked near Sohana by the British. The British defeated this force and Hanuman Singh was killed in action at age 90.

==Aftermath==

In the Treaty of Lahore on 9 March 1846, the Sikhs were made to surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the Beas River and Sutlej River. The Lahore Durbar was also required to pay an indemnity of 15 million rupees. Because it could not readily raise this sum, it ceded Kashmir, Hazarah and all the forts, territories, rights and interests in the hill countries situated between the Rivers Beas and Indus to the East India Company, as equivalent to ten million of rupees. In a later separate arrangement (the Treaty of Amritsar), the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, purchased Kashmir from the East India Company for a payment of 7.5 million rupees and was granted the title Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir.

The estate of Ladwa, belonging to Ajit Singh who had fought against the British at Buddowal and Aliwal, was confiscated in 1846. &quot;The Raja of Ladwa, with an estate of 10,000 pounds a year, almost openly avowed his treason, and, after a time, went over to the enemy (the British Raj) with all his troops and artillery&quot;, reads the Dispatch of the Governor General, sent to London on November 17, 1846. On September 22, 1847, through a ‘sanad’, the British awarded his house at Haridwar to the Raja of Patiala. Ajit Singh was taken into custody and sent as a prisoner to the Allahabad fort. He contrived to escape, after killing his keeper, and after long wanderings in hills, is supposed to have died in Kashmir. His children, who held in joint tenure eight villages along with Bhadour sardars, were dispatched by the British to these villages.

Maharaja Duleep Singh remained ruler of the Punjab and at first his mother, Maharani Jindan Kaur, remained as Regent. However, the Durbar later requested that the British presence remain until the Maharaja attained the age of 16. The British consented to this and on 16 December 1846, the Treaty of Bhyroval provided for the Maharani to be awarded a pension of 150,000 rupees and be replaced by a British resident in Lahore supported by a Council of Regency, with agents in other cities and regions. This effectively gave the East India Company control of the government.

Sikh historians have always maintained that, in order to retain their hold on power and maintain the figurehead rule of Duleep Singh, Lal Singh and Tej Singh embarked on the war with the deliberate intent of breaking their own army. In particular, Lal Singh was corresponding with a British political officer and betraying state and military secrets throughout the war. Lal Singh&#x27;s and Tej Singh&#x27;s desertion of their armies and refusal to attack when opportunity offered seem inexplicable otherwise.

The Sikh empire was until then one of the few remaining states in India after the rise of the company and the fall of the Mughal empire. Although the Sikh Army was weakened by the war, resentment at British interference in the government led to the Second Anglo-Sikh War within three years.

<doc id="935901" wikidata="Q163844" url="?curid=935901" title="The Boys from Syracuse">
<text>The Boys from Syracuse is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart, based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, as adapted by librettist George Abbott. The score includes swing and other contemporary rhythms of the 1930s. The show was the first musical based on a Shakespeare play. &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; was itself loosely based on a Roman play, &quot;The Menaechmi, or the Twin Brothers&quot;, by Plautus.

The show premiered on Broadway in 1938 and Off-Broadway in 1963, with later productions including a West End run in 1963 and in a Broadway revival in 2002. A film adaptation was released in 1940. Well-known songs from the score include &quot;Falling in Love with Love&quot;, &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Love&quot; and &quot;Sing for Your Supper&quot;.

==Production history==
Abbott directed and George Balanchine choreographed the original production, which opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theater on November 23, 1938, after tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut and Boston. The show closed on June 10, 1939 after 235 performances. It starred Eddie Albert (Antipholus of Syracuse), Ronald Graham (Antipholus of Ephesus), Teddy Hart (Dromio of Ephesus), Jimmy Savo (Dromio of Syracuse), Muriel Angelus (Adriana) and Marcy Westcott (Luciana).

==Plot==
Identical twins Antipholus of Ephesus and Antipholus of Syracuse were separated from each other in a shipwreck as young children. Their servants, both named Dromio, are also long-separated identical twins. When the pair from Syracuse come to Ephesus, a comedy of errors and mistaken identities ensues when the wives of the Ephesians, Adriana and her servant Luce, mistake the two strangers for their husbands. Adriana&#x27;s sister Luciana and the Syracuse Antipholus fall in love. But all ends happily.

<text>Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich (; 8 November 1050 – 16 April 1113) was Grand Prince of Kiev from 1093 to 1113. He was not a popular prince, and his reign was marked by incessant rivalry with his cousin Vladimir Monomakh.

==Early life==

Sviatopolk was the son of Iziaslav Iaroslavich by his concubine. During his brother Iaropolk&#x27;s life, Sviatopolk was not regarded as a potential claimant to the throne of Kiev. In 1069 he was sent to Polotsk, a city briefly taken by his father from the local ruler Vseslav, and then he spent ten years (1078–88) ruling Novgorod. Upon his brother&#x27;s death he succeeded him in Turov, which would remain in possession of his descendants until the 17th century.

==Reign==
When Vsevolod Iaroslavich died in 1093, Sviatopolk was acknowledged by other princes as the senior son of the grand prince and permitted to ascend the Kievan throne. Although he participated in the princely congresses organized by Vladimir Monomakh, he is sometimes charged with encouraging internecine wars among Rurikid princes. For instance, he sided with his cousin David of Volhynia and his son-in-law Bolesław III Wrymouth in capturing and blinding one of the Galician princes. He also sided with Vladimir Monomakh in several campaigns against the Kipchaks but was defeated in the Battle of the Stugna River (1093). Later that year, Sviatopolk was again defeated when faced with the Kipchaks, whereupon the latter destroyed Torchesk, an Oghuz Turk settlement.

In 1096, in an attempt to force Oleg I of Chernigov into a Rus compact, Sviatopolk left his lands undefended. His father-in-law, Tugorkhan, raided Pereyaslavl, while Boniak, a Cuman khan, raided as far as Kiev, destroying Berestovo and sacking the three monasteries of Klov, Vydubichi, and the Kiev Monastery of the Caves. Tugorkhan was killed during his raid on Pereiaslavl, and so Sviatopolk had him buried in Kiev.

In 1111, Sviatopolk, alongside Vladimir II, led an army at the , where they defeated a Cuman army on the river. The site of this battle is probably at modern-day Izium.

Sviatopolk&#x27;s Christian name was Michael, so he encouraged embellishment of St Michael&#x27;s Abbey in Kiev, which has been known as the &quot;Golden-Roofed&quot; up to the present. The history now known as &quot;the Primary Chronicle&quot; was compiled by the monk Nestor during Sviatopolk&#x27;s reign.

==Marriage and children==
Sviatopolk married firstly a Bohemian princess (Přemyslid dynasty), probably a daughter of Duke Spytihněv II. They had three children:
# Zbyslava, married to king Boleslaw III of Poland on November 15, 1102.
# Predslava, married to Prince Álmos of Hungary on August 21, 1104. Her fate is less known.
# Iaroslav (died 1123), Prince of Volynia and Turov was married three times - to the Hungarian-Polish Sophia (daughter of Władysław I Herman and his second wife Judith of Swabia), and Kievan princesses. In consequence of Iaroslav&#x27;s early death, his descendants forfeited any right to the Kievan throne and had to content themselves with Turov and Pinsk.

Secondly, in 1094 Sviatopolk married a daughter of Tugorkhan of the Kypchaks, Olena. They had four children:
# Anna (died 1136), married to Sviatoslav Davydych from Chernihiv who took monastic vows upon her death and later became Saint Nikolai Svyatoslav Davydych of Chernihiv.
# Maria, married Piotr Włostowic, castellan of Wrocław and Polish palatine.
# Bryachislav (1104–1127), possibly dethroned Iaroslav as the Prince of Turov (1118–1123) in 1118.
# Iziaslav (died 1127), possibly the Prince of Turov in 1123.

In 1104, Sviatopolk would marry for a third time to Barbara Komnena.

Some sources claim Sviatopolk had an out-of-wedlock son, Mstislav, who ruled Novgorod-Seversk from 1095 to 1097 and later Volyn (1097–1099). Mstislav later was murdered in Volodymyr-Volynski.

<doc id="935906" wikidata="Q3438138" url="?curid=935906" title="Bang Records">
<text>Bang Records was created by Bert Berns in 1965 together with his partners from Atlantic Records: Ahmet Ertegun, Nesuhi Ertegun and Jerry Wexler. The first letters of their names (Bert, Ahmet, Nesuhi, Gerald) formed the label&#x27;s name.

==Forming the company==
Berns had been staff producer at Atlantic Records for several years when he and Atlantic chief executives set out to create a new independent label. In 1966, Berns took sole control of the company. At Bang he had an immediate string of hit records, including &quot;I Want Candy&quot; by the Strangeloves, &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; by the McCoys, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; by Van Morrison and &quot;Solitary Man&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot; by Neil Diamond.

==Death of Berns==
When Berns died suddenly on December 30, 1967, as a result of a rheumatic heart condition, his wife Ilene Berns took over management. She believed that arguments with Van Morrison had been the cause of her husband&#x27;s death, and made things difficult for the Irish artist until Warner Brothers managed to untangle him from his Bang contract, though with some awkward conditions, such as giving Bang three original recordings a month for a year. According to Van Morrison the tension arose because of the contract he signed with Bang Records without legal advice. Morrison states that he has never received any royalties for writing or recording &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;. 
Others in the industry blame arguments, artistic differences and the ultimate loss of Neil Diamond, who was Bang&#x27;s biggest artist. Diamond has said his departure from Bang had been over his direction as an artist, and away from his early &quot;teenybopper&quot; type of recordings that Berns favored, which led to his refusal to release the more introspective &quot;Shilo&quot; as a single, even though Diamond felt it was part of his development as an artist. In 1968, shortly after what was said to be a &quot;tense&quot; confrontation with Berns, Diamond departed Bang for Uni/MCA Records. By 1970, a few years after Berns&#x27; death, Diamond had racked up a few hits on the Uni subsidiary of MCA. That year Bang finally released &quot;Shilo&quot; as a single, which promptly hit the Top 40 charts. Berns&#x27; young widow signed singer/songwriter Paul Davis, who had a number of hit records in the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Ride &#x27;Em Cowboy&quot;, &quot;I Go Crazy&quot;, &quot;Sweet Life&quot; and &quot;Do Right&quot;. Ilene Berns also signed and developed R&amp;B acts Brick (&quot;Dazz&quot;) and Peabo Bryson. Also in 1970 she hired promotion man Eddie Biscoe to help run Bang. They eventually married.

==Development of the label==
In 1971 Ilene moved Bang&#x27;s base of operations from New York City to Atlanta, Georgia. In the early years Bang did its own distribution. 
In 1979 Bang was sold to CBS Records, and kept its identity as part of the CBS Associated unit until it was absorbed in 1982 by CBS&#x27; Columbia Records unit. Over the years two subsidiary labels were started: Shout Records and Bullet Records. While Sony Music owns the Bang Records catalog today, the Berns family still owns the music publishing operations. In 1979 Columbia Records turned over control of Diamond&#x27;s Bang master recordings to the artist himself, at the time one of the label&#x27;s hottest stars, who has remixed and re-released them several times over the years and these masters are now owned by Capitol Records. Peabo Bryson was the only artist who released an album with Bullet. His recordings with Bullet are now owned by Capitol Records.

==Revival attempt==
Ilene Berns attempted to revive the Bang label as Bang II Records in the late 1990s under Sony Music Entertainment. Only two recordings were released: Monty Holmes&#x27; &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; and Sleepy&#x27;s Theme&#x27;s &quot;The Vinyl Room&quot;.

Ollerton has a joint parish council with Marthall, elected every 3 years. The villages share the new village hall in Marthall, which was constructed in November 2009.

Ollerton is thought to have come from the name Owlerton and is named in the Domesday Book of 1086.

<doc id="935924" wikidata="Q41514" url="?curid=935924" title="Mstislav I of Kiev">
<text>Mstislav I Vladimirovich Monomakh (; Christian name: &quot;Fedor&quot;; February 1076 – 14 April 1132), also known as Mstislav the Great, was Grand Prince of Kiev from 1125 until his death in 1132. After his death, the state began to quickly disintegrate into rival principalities.

He was the eldest son of Vladimir II Monomakh by Gytha of Wessex. He is figured prominently in the Norse Sagas under the name Harald, to allude to his grandfather, Harold II of England.

==Biography==
Mstislav was born in Turov. As his father&#x27;s future successor, he reigned in Novgorod from 1088 to 1093 and (after a brief stint at Rostov) from 1095 to 1117. Thereafter, he was Monomakh&#x27;s co-ruler in Belgorod Kievsky, and inherited the Kievan throne after his death. He built numerous churches in Novgorod, of which St. Nicholas Cathedral (1113), and the cathedral of St Anthony Cloister (1117) survive to the present day. Later, he would also erect important churches in Kiev, notably his family sepulchre at Berestovo and the church of the Assumption of the Mother of God in Podol.

Mstislav&#x27;s life was spent in constant warfare with the Cumans (1093; 1107; 1111; 1129), Estonians (1111; 1113; 1116; 1130), Lithuanians (1131), and the princedom of Polotsk (1127; 1129). In 1096, he defeated his uncle Oleg of Chernigov on the Koloksha River, thereby laying foundation for the centuries of enmity between his and Oleg&#x27;s descendants. Mstislav was the last ruler of a unified state, and upon his death, as the chronicler put it, &quot;the land of Rus was torn apart&quot;. He died in Kiev, aged 55.

After his death, the state began to quickly disintegrate. At the time of Monomakhs&#x27;s death, there had been only two main groups in the princely family, the &quot;Monomakhovichi&quot; and &quot;Olgovichi&quot;, but as the family proliferated, it broke up into a number of local branches and sub-branches.

He was canonized as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church and is commemorated on 15 April in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Family==
In 1095, Mstislav married Princess Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden, daughter of King Inge I of Sweden. They had:
# Ingeborg of Kiev, married Canute Lavard of Jutland, and was mother to Valdemar I of Denmark
# Malmfred, married (1) Sigurd I of Norway; (2) Eric II of Denmark
# Eupraxia, married Alexius Comnenus, son of John II Comnenus
# Vsevolod of Novgorod and Pskov
# Maria Mstislavna of Kiev, married Vsevolod II of Kiev
# Iziaslav II of Kiev
# Rostislav of Kiev
# Sviatopolk of Pskov
# Rogneda, married Yaroslav of Volhynia
# Xenia, married Briachislav of Izyaslavl

Christine died on 18 January 1122. Later that year Mstislav married again, to Liubava Dmitrievna Zavidich, the daughter of Dmitry Saviditsch, a nobleman of Novgorod. Their children were:
# Vladimir III Mstislavich (1132–1171)
# Euphrosyne of Kiev, (c. 1130 – c. 1193) married King Géza II of Hungary in 1146.

<text>Warner Records Inc. (known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label. A subsidiary of Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.

Artists who have recorded for Warner Records include Madonna, Prince, Tevin Campbell, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, Liam Gallagher, Jisoo, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.

==History==
===Founding===
At the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark &amp; Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.

In 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.

In December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick&#x27;s pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick&#x27;s back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.

===1958–1963: formation and early years===
Warner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance—the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business—lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.

In 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business—Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen &amp; Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment business and he began to push Jack Warner on the issue of setting up an &#x27;in-house&#x27; record label. With the record business booming – sales had topped US$500 million by 1958 – Semnenko argued that it was foolish for Warner Bros. to make deals with other companies to release its soundtracks when, for less than the cost of one motion picture, they could establish their own label, creating a new income stream that could continue indefinitely and provide an additional means of exploiting and promoting its contract actors.

Another impetus for the label&#x27;s creation was the music career of Warner Bros. actor Tab Hunter. Although Hunter was signed to an exclusive acting contract with the studio, it did not prevent him from signing a recording contract, which he did with Dot Records, owned at the time by Paramount Pictures. Hunter scored several hits for Dot, including the US No. 1 single, &quot;Young Love&quot; (1957) and, to Warner Bros.&#x27; chagrin, reporters were primarily asking about the hit record, rather than Hunter&#x27;s latest Warner movie. In 1958, the studio signed Hunter as its first artist to its newly formed record division, although his subsequent recordings for the label failed to duplicate his success with Dot.

Warner Bros. agreed to buy Imperial Records in 1956 and, although the deal fell apart, it marked the breaking of a psychological barrier: &quot;If the company was willing to buy another label, why &quot;not&quot; start its own?&quot; To establish the label, the company hired former Columbia Records president James B. Conkling; its founding directors of A&amp;R were Harris Ashburn, George Avakian, and Bob Prince. Conkling was an able administrator with extensive experience in the industry—he had been instrumental in launching the LP format at Columbia and had played a key role in establishing the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences the previous year. However, Conkling had decidedly middle-of-the-road musical tastes (he was married to Donna King of vocal trio the King Sisters), and was thus rather out of step with emerging trends in the industry, especially the fast-growing market for rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music.

Warner Bros. Records opened for business on March 19, 1958. Its early album releases (1958–1960) were aimed at the upscale end of the mainstream audience, and Warner Bros. took an early (though largely unsuccessful) lead in recording stereo LPs that targeted the new &quot;hi-fi&quot; market. The catalogue in this period included:
* vocal/spoken word albums by Warner contract players such as Tab Hunter, Edd Byrnes, Connie Stevens, Jack Webb and William Holden
* novelty/comedy albums by artists such as Spike Jones and Bob Newhart
* film soundtracks and collections of film and TV themes
* &#x27;middle of the road&#x27; instrumental albums by artists including Matty Matlock, Buddy Cole, Henry Mancini, George Greeley, Warren Barker and &quot;Ira Ironstrings&quot; (a pseudonym for guitarist Alvino Rey, Conkling&#x27;s brother-in-law, who was in fact under contract to Capitol Records at the time).

Some albums featured jokey or self-deprecating titles such as:
* &quot;Music for People with $3.98 (Plus Tax If Any)&quot;,
* &quot;Terribly Sophisticated Songs: A Collection of Unpopular Songs for Popular People&quot;,
* &quot;Songs the Kids Brought Home from Camp&quot;,
* &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Put Your Empties on the Piano&quot;, and
* &quot;But You&#x27;ve Never Heard Gershwin with Bongos&quot;.
Almost all were commercial failures; and the only charting album in Warner Bros.&#x27; first two years was Warren Barker&#x27;s &#x27;soundtrack&#x27; album for the studio&#x27;s hit series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, which reached No. 3 in 1959. Tab Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Jealous Heart&quot; (WB 5008), which reached No. 62, was Warner Bros.&#x27; only charting single during its first year.

Early Warner Bros. singles had distinctive pink labels, with the WB logo at the top center and &quot;WARNER&quot; in white Hellenic font to the left of the WB shield and &quot;BROS.&quot; in the same color and style font to the right. Below the shield in white Rockwell font, it read &quot;VITAPHONIC HIGH FIDELITY;&quot; this 45 label was used for two years, 1958 – 1960. This initial 45 label was soon replaced by a new, all-red label with the WB shield logo at 9 o&#x27;clock and a number of different-colored arrows (blue, chartreuse, and yellow) surrounding and pointing away from the center hole. The first hit was the novelty record &quot;Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)&quot;, with words and music by Irving Taylor, which reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was nominally performed by Warner contract actor Edd Byrnes, who played the wisecracking hipster character Gerald Lloyd &quot;Kookie&quot; Kookson III on Warner&#x27;s TV detective series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. The story behind the recording illustrates the sharp practices often employed by major recording companies. Actress and singer Connie Stevens (who appeared in the Warner TV series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;) spoke on the song&#x27;s chorus, but although her record contract entitled her to a five-percent royalty rate, the label arbitrarily defined her contribution to be a favor to Byrnes, and assigned her just 1% royalty on the song, despite the fact that, as she soon discovered, her name was being prominently displayed on the single&#x27;s label. Warner Bros. also charged her for a share of the recording costs, which was to be recouped from her drastically reduced royalty. When Stevens scored her own hit single with &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot; in 1960, Warner Bros. refused to allow her to perform it on &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; because it was not published by MPHC, and they also prevented her from singing it on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, thereby robbing her of nationwide promotion (and a $5000 appearance fee).

With only two hits to its credit in two years, the label was in serious financial trouble by 1960, having lost at least US$3 million and music historian Fredric Dannen reports that the only reason it was not closed down was because the Warner board was reluctant to write off the additional $2 million the label was owed in outstanding receivables and inventory. After a restructure, Conkling was obliged to report to Herman Starr; he rejected a buyout offer by Conkling and a group of other record company employees but agreed to keep the label running in exchange for heavy cost-cutting—the staff was reduced from 100 to 30 and Conkling voluntarily cut his own pay from $1000 to $500.

Warner Bros. now turned to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll acts in hopes of advancing its sales but their first signing, Bill Haley, was by then past his prime and failed to score any hits. The label was more fortunate with its next signing, the Everly Brothers, whom Warner Bros. secured after the end of their previous contract with Cadence Records. Herman Starr effectively gambled the future of the company by approving what was reputed to be the first million-dollar contract in music history, which guaranteed the Everly Brothers $525,000 against an escalating royalty rate of up to 7 percent, well above the industry standard of the day. The duo were fielding offers from all the major labels as their Cadence contract wound up, but Warners eventually won out because the brothers harboured ambitions to branch out into film, and the label&#x27;s connection to the movie studio provided the perfect opportunity. Luckily, the Everlys&#x27; first Warner Bros. single &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; was a smash hit, climbing to No. 1 in the US and selling more than eight million copies, and their debut Warner Bros. album &quot;It&#x27;s Everly Time&quot; reached No. 9 on the album chart.

In late 1959, Warner Bros signed a virtually unknown Chicago-based comedian, Bob Newhart, marking the beginning of the label&#x27;s continuing involvement with comedy. Newhart provided the label&#x27;s next major commercial breakthrough — in May 1960, three months after the success of &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot;, Newhart&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; unexpectedly shot straight to No. 1 in the US, staying at the top for fourteen weeks, charting for more than two years and selling more than 600,000 copies. Capping this commercial success, Newhart scored historic wins in three major categories at the 1961 Grammy Awards — he won Album of the Year for &quot;Button-Down Mind&quot;, his quickly released follow-up album, &quot;The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back&quot; (1960) won the Best Comedy Performance–Spoken Word category, and Newhart himself won Best New Artist, the first time in Grammy history that a comedy album had won Album of the Year, and the only time a comedian has won Best New Artist.

Interviewed for the official Warner Bros Records history in 2008, Newhart recalled that at the time he signed with the label he was totally unknown outside Chicago, he was still working full-time as an accountant, and he had done only a few local radio and TV appearances. His break came thanks to a friend, local DJ Dan Sorkin, who knew Warner CEO Jim Conkling. Sorkin arranged for Newhart to make a demo tape of a few of his original sketches, which Conkling heard and liked. Equally remarkably, Newhart revealed that he had never performed in a club prior to recording the album. Warners arranged to record him at a Houston, Texas club called The Tidelands, where he was booked for a two-week residency as the opening act, beginning February 12, 1960, and Newhart freely admitted to being &quot;terrified&quot; on his first night. He quickly realised that he had only enough material for one side of an album, but by the time Warner A&amp;R manager George Avakian arrived for the recording, Newhart had hastily written enough new material to fill both sides of an LP. When Newhart contacted Warners in April to find out when the album would be released, he was amazed to be told that the label was rushing all available copies to Minneapolis, because radio DJs there had broken it, and it had become so popular that a local newspaper was even printing the times that tracks would be played on air. He recalled that the success of the album almost instantly kick-started his career, and that he was soon being deluged with appearance offers, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. A few months later, when Newhart met Conkling and Jack Warner at a dinner, he recalled that Warner effusively greeted him as &quot;the man who saved Warner Brothers Records&quot;.

Despite the turnaround in the label&#x27;s commercial and critical fortunes at the start of the new decade, Jim Conkling was unexpectedly forced out as CEO during 1961. The ostensible reason for his ousting was that Warner and the studio executives doubted Conkling&#x27;s commitment to the label, after they discovered that he had sold his shares of Warner Bros stock, netting him around $1 million. However, label biographer Warren Zanes and former WBR executive Stan Cornyn both opined that this was merely a pretext, and that the studio effectively scapegoated Conkling for the label&#x27;s earlier failures, pointing to the fact that Conkling&#x27;s successor had been selected well before Conkling was terminated. Conkling resigned in the fall of that year, and was replaced by Mike Maitland, another former Capitol Records executive. Around the same time, Joe Smith was appointed as head of promotions.

Warner Bros. made another prescient signing in folk group Peter, Paul &amp; Mary. The trio had been on the verge of signing with Atlantic Records, but before the deal could be completed they were poached by Warner Bros. Artie Mogull (who worked for one of Warner Bros.&#x27; publishing companies, Witmark Music) had introduced their manager Albert Grossman to Herman Starr, and as a result the group signed a recording and publishing deal with Warner Bros. Grossman&#x27;s deal for the group broke new ground for recording artists — it included a substantial advance of $30,000 and, most significantly, it set a new benchmark for recording contracts by stipulating that the trio would have complete creative control over the recording and packaging of their music.

Soon after, Grossman and Mogull signed a publishing deal that gave Witmark one of its most lucrative clients, Bob Dylan. Grossman bought out Dylan&#x27;s previous contract with Leeds Music and signed the then-unknown singer-songwriter to Witmark for an advance of $5000. Two years later in 1963, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary scored two consecutive Top 10 hits with Dylan songs, launching Dylan&#x27;s career, and this was followed by many more hits by artists covering Dylan&#x27;s songs, alongside the growing commercial success of Dylan himself. Grossman benefited enormously from both deals, because he took a 25% commission as Dylan&#x27;s manager, and he structured Dylan&#x27;s publishing deal so that he received 50% of Witmark&#x27;s share of Dylan&#x27;s publishing income—a tactic that was later emulated by other leading artist managers such as David Geffen.

Meanwhile, the label enjoyed further major success with comedy recordings. Comedian Allan Sherman (who had been signed on the personal recommendation of George Burns), issued his first Warner LP &quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot; in 1962. The album, which satirized the folk boom, became a major hit, selling over a million copies, and winning a Gold Record award, and is cited as being the fastest-selling LP ever released in the US up to that time. Sherman also scored a hit single in late 1963 with a cut from his third WBR album, &quot;My Son, The Nut&quot;, when his song &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah&quot; (which satirized the American summer camp tradition) became a surprise novelty hit, peaking at #2.

Bill Cosby broke through soon after and he continued the label&#x27;s dream run with comedy LPs into the late 1960s, releasing a string of highly successful albums on Warner Bros. over the next six years, alongside his groundbreaking career as a TV actor.

The label&#x27;s fortunes had finally turned around by 1962 thanks to the Everly Brothers, Newhart, folk stars Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, jazz and pop crossover hit Joanie Sommers and comedian Allan Sherman, and Warner Bros. Records ended the financial year 1961–62 in the black for the first time since its founding.

===Warner/Reprise 1963–1967===
In August 1963, Warner Bros. made a &quot;rescue takeover&quot; of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s ailing Reprise Records as part of a deal to acquire Sinatra&#x27;s services as a recording artist and as an actor for Warner Bros. Pictures. The total deal was valued at around US$10 million, and it gave Sinatra a one-third share in the combined record company and a seat on the Warner/Reprise board; Warner Bros. Records head Mike Maitland became the president of the new combine and Mo Ostin was retained as manager of the Reprise label.

Reprise was heavily in debt at the time of the takeover, and the Warner Records management team was reportedly dismayed at their balance sheet being pushed back into the red by the acquisition, but they were given no choice in the matter. Ben Kalmenson, a Warner Bros. company director and close aide to Jack Warner, summoned the label&#x27;s directors to a meeting in New York and explicitly told them that both he and Warner wanted the deal and that they expected them to vote in favor of it.

Despite these misgivings, the purchase ultimately proved very beneficial to the Warner group. Reprise flourished in the late 1960s thanks to Sinatra&#x27;s famous comeback and the hits by Sinatra and his daughter Nancy, and the label also secured the US distribution rights to the recordings of the Kinks and Jimi Hendrix. Most importantly for the future of the company, the merger brought Reprise manager Mo Ostin into the Warner fold and &quot;his ultimate value to Warner Bros. would dwarf Sinatra&#x27;s.&quot; Ostin&#x27;s business and musical instincts, and his rapport with artists were to prove crucial to the success of the Warner labels over the next two decades.

In 1964, Warner Bros. launched Loma Records, which was meant to focus on R&amp;B acts. The label, run by former King Records promotion man Bob Krasnow, would release over 100 singles and five albums, but saw only limited success and was wound down in 1968.

An important addition to the Warner Bros. staff in this period was Ed Thrasher, who moved from Columbia Records in 1964 to become Warner/Reprise&#x27;s head art director. Among his design credits for the Warner family of labels were The Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, The Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot;, The Doobie Brothers&#x27; &quot;Toulouse Street&quot;, Tiny Tim&#x27;s &quot;God Bless Tiny Tim&quot;, and Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Clouds&quot;, which set off a trend of musicians creating the artwork for their own record sleeves. In 1973, when Frank Sinatra emerged from retirement with his comeback album, Thrasher shot candid photographs for the cover and also devised the album title &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot;, which was widely used to promote Sinatra&#x27;s return to recording and touring. Besides his work on album covers, Thrasher art-directed many of Warner Bros.&#x27; ads and posters from 1964 to 1979.
In 1964, Warner Bros. successfully negotiated with French label Disques Vogue and Warner Bros.&#x27; British distributor Pye Records for the rights to distribute Petula Clark&#x27;s recordings in the US (said rights previously being held by Laurie Records). Clark soon scored a No. 1 US hit with &quot;Downtown&quot;. Warner also released other Pye artists in the US market, and, in return, Pye distributed recordings issued by Warner in the UK from 1964 to 1970.

Another significant development in the label&#x27;s history came in 1966 when Ostin hired young independent producer Lenny Waronker as an A&amp;R manager, beginning a strong and enduring mentor/protegé relationship between the two. Waronker, the son of Liberty Records founder Simon Waronker, had previously worked as an assistant to Liberty producer Snuff Garrett. Later he worked with the small San Francisco label Autumn Records, founded by disc jockeys Tom Donahue, Bobby Mitchell, and Sylvester Stewart (who would soon become famous as a musician under his stage name Sly Stone).

Waronker had been hired as a freelance producer for some of Autumn&#x27;s acts including The Tikis (who later became Harpers Bizarre), The Beau Brummels, and The Mojo Men, and for these recording sessions he brought in several musician friends who were then becoming established on the L.A. music scene: composer/musicians Randy Newman (a childhood friend), Leon Russell, and Van Dyke Parks. Together they became the foundation of the creative salon that centered on Waronker at Warner Bros. and which, with Ostin&#x27;s continuing support, became the catalyst for Warner Records&#x27; subsequent success as a rock music label. Initially, Waronker looked after the acts that Warner Bros. took over when they bought Autumn Records for $10,000, but during the year he also avidly pursued rising Los Angeles band The Buffalo Springfield. Although (much to his and Ostin&#x27;s chagrin) the band was ultimately signed by Atlantic Records, they eventually became part of the Warner Bros. catalogue after Atlantic was purchased by Warner Bros. Records.

In 1967, Warner Bros. took over Valiant Records, which added hit-making harmony pop group The Association to the Warner roster. This acquisition proved to be another huge money-maker for Warner Bros.; The Association scored a string of major hits in the late 1960s, and their 1967 hit &quot;Never My Love&quot; went on to become the second-most-played song on American radio and TV in the 20th century. During the year, the label also took its first tentative step into the burgeoning rock market when they signed leading San Francisco psychedelic rock group The Grateful Dead. Warner Bros. threw the band a release party at Fugazi Hall in San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach. During the concert, Warner A&amp;R manager Joe Smith took the stage and announced, &quot;I just want to say what an honor it is to be able to introduce the Grateful Dead and its music to the world,&quot; which prompted a cynical Jerry Garcia to quip in reply, &quot;I just want to say what an honor it is for the Grateful Dead to introduce Warner Bros. Records to the world.&quot;

Also in 1967, Warner/Reprise established its Canadian operation Warner Reprise Canada Ltd., replacing its distribution deal with the Compo Company. This was the origin of Warner Music Canada.

===1967–1969: Warner Bros.-Seven Arts===
In November 1966 the entire Warner group was taken over by and merged with Seven Arts Productions, a New York-based company owned by Eliot Hyman. Seven Arts specialized in syndicating old movies and cartoons to TV, and had independently produced a number of significant feature films for other studios, including Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot;, as well as forging a successful production partnership with noted British studio Hammer Films. Hyman&#x27;s purchase of Jack L. Warner&#x27;s controlling share of the Warner group for US$32 million stunned the film world—Warner Records executive Joe Smith later quipped that it was

The newly merged group was renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts (often referred to in the trade press by the abbreviation it adopted for its new logo, &quot;W7&quot;). Although Warner Bros. Pictures was faltering, the purchase coincided with a period of tremendous growth in the music industry, and Warner-Reprise was now on its way to becoming a major player in the industry. Hyman&#x27;s investment banker Alan Hirshfeld, of Charles Allen and Company, urged him to expand the company&#x27;s record holdings, and arranged a meeting with Jerry Wexler, and Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, co-owners of leading independent label Atlantic Records, which eventually resulted in the purchase of Atlantic in 1968.

In June 1967, Mo Ostin attended the historic Monterey International Pop Festival, where The Association performed the opening set. Ostin had already acquired the US rights to The Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s recordings, sight unseen, but he was reportedly unimpressed by Hendrix&#x27;s now-famous performance. During his visit he met Andy Wickham, who had come to Monterey as an assistant to festival promoter Lou Adler. Wickham had worked as a commercial artist in London, followed by a stint with Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s Immediate Records before moving to Los Angeles to work for Adler&#x27;s Dunhill label. Ostin initially hired Wickham as Warner&#x27;s &quot;house hippie&quot; on a generous retainer of $200 per week. Hanging out around Laurel Canyon, Wickham scouted for new talent and established a rapport with the young musicians Warner Bros. was seeking to sign. Like Lenny Waronker, Wickham&#x27;s youth, intelligence and hip attitude allowed him to bridge the &quot;generation gap between these young performers and the older Warner &#x27;establishment&#x27;&quot;. He played a major role in signing Eric Andersen, Jethro Tull, Van Morrison, and Joni Mitchell (who signed to Reprise), whom Wickham successfully recommended to Ostin in his first week with the company. Over the next thirty years, Wickham became one of Warner&#x27;s most influential A&amp;R managers, signing such notable acts as Emmylou Harris, Buck Owens, and Norwegian pop trio a-ha.

During this formative period, Warner Bros. made several other notable new signings including Randy Newman and Van Dyke Parks. Newman would not make his commercial breakthrough until the mid-1970s but he achieved a high profile in the industry thanks to songs he wrote that were covered by other acts like Three Dog Night and Alan Price. Although Warner Bros. spent large sums on albums that sold poorly, and there were some missteps in its promotion strategy, the presence of unorthodox acts like The Grateful Dead and critically acclaimed &#x27;cult&#x27; performers like Newman and Parks, combined with the artistic freedom that the label afforded them, proved significant in building Warner Bros.&#x27; reputation and credibility. Bob Krasnow, who briefly headed Warner Bros.&#x27; short-lived &#x27;black&#x27; label Loma Records, later commented that The Grateful Dead &quot;...were really the springboard. People said, &#x27;Wow, if they&#x27;ll sign The Dead, they must be going in the right direction.&#x27;&quot;

Although not widely known to the general public at that time, Van Dyke Parks was a figure of high repute on the L.A. music scene thanks to his work as a session musician and songwriter (notably with the Byrds and Harper&#x27;s Bizarre), and especially because of his renowned collaboration with Brian Wilson on the legendary unreleased Beach Boys album &quot;Smile&quot;. In 1967, Lenny Waronker produced Parks&#x27; Warner debut album &quot;Song Cycle&quot;, which reportedly cost more than $35,000 to record, making it one of the most expensive &#x27;pop&#x27; albums ever made up to that time. It sold very poorly despite rave critical reviews, so publicist Stan Cornyn (who had helped the label to sign The Grateful Dead) wrote an infamous tongue-in-cheek advertisement to promote it. The ad cheekily declared that the label had &quot;lost $35,509 on &#x27;the album of the year&#x27; (dammit),&quot; suggested that those who had purchased the album had probably worn their copies out by playing it over and over, and made the offer that listeners could send these supposedly worn-out copies back to Warner Bros., who would exchange it for two new copies, including one &quot;to educate a friend with.&quot; Incensed by the tactic, Parks accused Cornyn of trying to kill his career. Cornyn encountered similar problems with Joni Mitchell—he penned an advertisement that was meant to convey the message that Mitchell was yet to achieve significant market penetration, but the tag-line &quot;Joni Mitchell is 90% Virgin&quot; reportedly reduced Mitchell to tears, and Cornyn had to withdraw it from publication.

Warner Bros. also struggled with their flagship rock act, The Grateful Dead who, like Peter, Paul and Mary, had negotiated complete artistic control over the recording and packaging of their music. Their debut album had been recorded in just four days, and although it was not a major hit, it cracked the US Top 50 album chart and sold steadily, eventually going gold in 1971. For their second album, The Grateful Dead took a far more experimental approach, embarking on a marathon series of recording sessions lasting seven months, from September 1967 to March 1968. They started the album with David Hassinger, who had produced their first album, but he quit the project in frustration in December 1967 while they were recording in New York City (although he is co-credited with the band on the album). The group and their concert sound engineer Dan Healy then took over production of the album themselves, taking the unusual step of intermixing studio material with multitrack recordings of their concerts. &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot; proved to be the least successful of The Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1960s albums—it sold poorly, the extended sessions put the band more than $100,000 in debt to the label, and Warner Bros. executive Joe Smith later described it as &quot;the most unreasonable project with which we have ever involved ourselves.&quot;

The Grateful Dead&#x27;s relationship with Warner Bros. Records was stretched even further by the making of their third album &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; (1969), which also took around seven months to record and cost $180,000, almost twice as much as its predecessor. It sold poorly and took almost thirty years to be accredited with gold-record status. There were further difficulties in 1971 when the band presented Warner Bros. with a planned live double album that they wanted to call &quot;Skull Fuck&quot;, but Ostin handled the matter diplomatically. Rather than refusing point-blank to release it, he reminded The Grateful Dead that they were heavily in debt to Warner&#x27;s and would not see any royalties until this had been repaid; he also pointed out that the provocative title would inevitably hurt sales because major retailers like Sears would refuse to stock it. Realizing that this would reduce their income, the band voluntarily changed the title to Grateful Dead, known generally as &quot;Skull and Roses&quot;.

Some of Warner Bros.&#x27; biggest commercial successes during this period were with &quot;Sunshine Pop&quot; acts. Harpers Bizarre scored a No. 13 Billboard hit in April 1967 with their version of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&#x27; Groovy)&quot;, and a month later The Association scored a US No. 1 with &quot;Windy&quot;, and they reached No. 8 on the album chart with their first Warner Bros. album &quot;Insight Out&quot;. Their next single &quot;Never My Love&quot; also topped the charts in autumn 1967 (No. 2 Billboard, No. 1 Cashbox), and now ranks as one of the most successful of all Warner Bros. recordings—it became a radio staple and is now accredited by BMI as the second most-played song on US radio in the 20th century, surpassing both &quot;Yesterday&quot; by the Beatles and &quot;Stand by Me&quot; by Ben E. King. The group&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Greatest Hits album&quot; was also a major hit, reaching No. 4 on the US album chart. In 1968, Mason Williams&#x27; instrumental composition &quot;Classical Gas&quot; reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, selling more than a million copies, and Williams won three Grammys that year.

Another notable Warner release from this period was &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, the second solo album by Van Morrison (his first was on Bang), who signed with the label in 1968. Although it sold relatively poorly on its first release (and did not reach gold record status until 2001), it has been widely acclaimed by musicians and critics worldwide, has featured on many &quot;Best Albums of All Time&quot; lists, and has remained in release almost continuously since 1968.

During 1968, using the profits from Warner/Reprise, W7 purchased Atlantic Records for $17.5 million, including the label&#x27;s valuable archive, its growing roster of new artists, and the services of its three renowned executives Jerry Wexler, Nesuhi Ertegun and Ahmet Ertegun. However, the purchase again caused rancor among the Warner/Reprise management, who were upset that their hard-won profits had been co-opted to buy Atlantic, and that Atlantic&#x27;s executives were made large shareholders in Warner-Seven Arts—the deal gave the Ertegun brothers and Wexler between them 66,000 shares of Warner Bros.&#x27; common stock.

On June 1, 1968, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that Warner Bros. Records&#x27; star comedy performer Bill Cosby had turned down a five-year, US$3.5 million contract renewal offer, and would leave the label in August of that year to record for his own Tetragrammaton Records label. Just over one month later (July 13) &quot;Billboard&quot; reported on a major reorganization of the entire Warner-Seven Arts music division. Mike Maitland was promoted to Executive Vice-president of both the recorded music and publishing operations, and George Lee took over from Victor Blau as operational head of the recording division. The restructure also reversed the reporting arrangement put in place in 1960, and from this point the Warner publishing arm reported to the record division under Maitland. The &quot;Billboard&quot; article also noted the enormous growth and vital significance of W7&#x27;s music operations, which were by then providing most of Warner-Seven Arts&#x27; revenue—during the first nine months of that fiscal year, the recording and publishing divisions generated 74% of the corporation&#x27;s total profit, with the publishing division alone accounting for over US$2 million of ASCAP&#x27;s collections from music users.

===1969–1972: Kinney takeover===
In 1969, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was taken over by the Kinney National Company, headed by New York businessman Steve J. Ross, who would successfully lead the Warner group of companies until his death in 1992. The US$400 million deal created a new conglomerate that combined the Warner film, television, recording, and music publishing divisions with Kinney&#x27;s multi-faceted holdings. Ross had founded the company in the late 1950s while working in his family&#x27;s funeral business—seeing the opportunity to use the company&#x27;s cars, which were idle at night, he founded a successful car hire operation, which he later merged with the Kinney parking garage company. Ross took the company public in 1962, and from this base it expanded rapidly between 1966 and 1968, merging with National Cleaning Services in 1966 to form the Kinney National Company, and then acquiring a string of companies that would prove of enormous value to the Warner group in the years ahead–National Periodical Publications (which included DC Comics and All American Comics), the Ashley-Famous talent agency, and Panavision.

In the summer of 1969, Atlantic Records agreed to assist Warner Bros. Records in establishing overseas divisions, but when Warner executive Phil Rose arrived in Australia to begin setting up a subsidiary there, he discovered that just one week earlier Atlantic had signed a new four-year production and distribution deal with local label Festival Records without informing Warner Bros.

During 1969, the rivalry between Mike Maitland and Ahmet Ertegun quickly escalated into an all-out executive battle, but Steve Ross favored Ertegun, and the conflict culminated in Maitland being dismissed from his position on January 25, 1970. He declined an offer of a job with Warner Bros. Pictures and left the company, subsequently becoming president of MCA Records. Mo Ostin was appointed president of Warner Bros. Records with Joe Smith as executive vice-president.

In 1970, the &#x27;Seven Arts&#x27; name was dropped and the WB shield became the Warner Bros. Records logo again.

===1970–1979: The Ostin era===
Beginning back in 1967 with the signing of the Grateful Dead, Warner Bros. Records and its affiliate labels steadily built up a diverse and prestigious lineup of rock and pop artists through the 1970s, and earning a strong reputation as an &quot;artists first&quot; record company. Under the guidance of Edward West, vice-president of Warner Bros. Records Inc in 1973 and its executives, A&amp;R managers and staff producers, including Mo Ostin, Chason Samuel, David Geffen, Joe Smith, Stan Cornyn, Lenny Waronker, Andy Wickham, Russ Titelman and ex-Warner Bros. recording artist (with Harpers Bizarre) Ted Templeman, sales grew steadily throughout the decade and by the end of the 1970s Warner Bros. and its sister labels had become one of the world&#x27;s leading recording groups, with a star-studded roster that included Fleetwood Mac, James Taylor, Van Morrison, America, Alice Cooper, Carly Simon, Van Halen, the Doobie Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, Chaka Khan, Ambrosia, and Rickie Lee Jones. This was augmented by the group&#x27;s valuable back-catalogue, and lucrative licensing deals with American and international labels including Sire, Vertigo and Island Records (1975–1982) that gave WBR the American distribution rights for leading British and European rock acts including Deep Purple, Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, Roxy Music, King Crimson and Kraftwerk. Aided by the growth of FM radio and the album oriented rock format, LPs became the primary vehicle of Warner Bros. sales successes throughout the 1970s, although artists such as the Doobie Brothers and America also scored many major US and international hit singles.

One of the first Warner Bros. albums to achieve both critical and commercial success in the early 1970s was Van Morrison&#x27;s third solo album &quot;Moondance&quot; (January 1970) which consolidated his distinctive blend of rock, jazz and R&amp;B, earned glowing critical praise and sold well—it made the Top 40 album chart in both the US and the UK, the single &quot;Come Running&quot; was a US Top 40 hit (No. 39, Billboard) and the title track became a radio perennial.

British group Black Sabbath were signed to Philips Records&#x27; progressive subsidiary Vertigo in their native country. Deep Purple, who recorded for EMI&#x27;s Parlophone and Harvest labels in England, were originally signed in the US to the independent Tetragrammaton Records, which was distributed by Warner Bros., who acquired the label after it folded in 1970. Black Sabbath&#x27;s eponymous debut album (recorded in just two days) reached No. 8 on the UK album chart, and No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it remained for over a year, selling strongly despite some negative reviews. It has since been certified platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and in the UK by British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Sabbath&#x27;s second album was to have been called &quot;War Pigs&quot;, but Warner Bros. Records changed the title to &quot;Paranoid&quot; fearing a backlash by consumers. It was a Top 10 hit on the US album chart in 1971, and went on to sell four million copies in the US alone with virtually no radio airplay.

By 1970, &quot;Seven Arts&quot; was dropped from the company name and the WB shield became the Warner Bros. Records logo again. During 1972, a financial scandal in its parking operations forced Kinney National to spin off its non-entertainment assets, and the Warner recording, publishing and film divisions then became part of a new umbrella company, Warner Communications.

In July 1970, the Warner recording group acquired another prestige asset with the purchase of Jac Holzman&#x27;s Elektra Records for US$10 million. Like Atlantic, the new acquisition came with a very valuable back-catalogue, which included the Doors, Love, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Tim Buckley, the Stooges, MC5 and Bread, but Elektra soon began producing more major hits under the Warner umbrella. Recent signing Carly Simon scored two successive Top 20 singles in 1971 with &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I&#x27;ve Always Heard It Should Be&quot; and &quot;Anticipation&quot;, and her first two albums both made the Billboard Top 50, but the following year she topped the single and album charts with her international smash hit &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; and the album &quot;No Secrets&quot;, which both went to No. 1 in the US. Jac Holzman ran the label until 1972, when he was succeeded by David Geffen and Elektra was merged with Geffen&#x27;s label Asylum Records. Geffen was forced to step down in 1975 for health reasons and Joe Smith was appointed president in his place, although the label&#x27;s fortunes subsequently waned considerably, with Elektra-Asylum reportedly losing some $27 million during the last two years of Smith&#x27;s tenure.

With three co-owned record companies, the next step was the formation of the group&#x27;s in-house distribution arm, initially called Kinney Records Distributing Corporation, to better control distribution of product and make sure records by breaking new acts were available.

In 1971, UK-based pop rock trio America were signed to the recently established British division of Warner Bros. Their debut album, released late in the year, at first enjoyed only moderate success, but in early 1972 their single &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot; became a major international hit, reaching No. 1 in the US. Warner hastily reissued the album with the song included and it too became a huge hit, reaching No. 1 on the US album chart and eventually earning a platinum record award. Although criticized for their similarity to Neil Young (indeed, rumors circulated around Hollywood that Young had cut the track anonymously), America scored five more US Top 10 singles over the next three years, including a second US No. 1 with &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; in 1975. Their albums performed very strongly in the charts—each of their first seven albums were US Top 40 albums, five of these made the Top 10 and all but one (&quot;Hat Trick&quot;, 1973) achieved either gold or platinum status. Their 1975 &quot;&quot; album became a perennial seller and is now accredited at 4× platinum.

In 1972, Dionne Warwick was signed to Warner Bros. Records after leaving Scepter Records in what was the biggest contract at the time for a female recording artist, although her five years at Warner Bros. were relatively unsuccessful in comparison to her spectacular hit-making tenure at Scepter.

After a slow start, the Doobie Brothers proved to be one of Warner Bros.&#x27; most successful signings. Their debut album made little impact but their second album &quot;Toulouse Street&quot; (1972) reached No. 21 and spawned two US Top 40 singles, &quot;Listen to the Music&quot; and &quot;Jesus is Just Alright&quot;, inaugurating a string of hit albums and singles over the next five years. Their third album &quot;The Captain and Me&quot; was even more successful, reaching No. 7 in the US and producing two more hit singles, &quot;China Grove&quot; (#15) and &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot; (#8); it became a consistent seller and is now accredited 2× Platinum by the RIAA. &quot;What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits&quot; (1974) reached No. 4 and produced two more hits including their first US No. 1 single &quot;Black Water&quot; (1975). &quot;Stampede&quot; also reached No. 4, and produced another hit single with the Motown cover &quot;Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)&quot; (US #11).

Warner Bros. Records&#x27; reputation for nurturing new artists was demonstrated by the career of Alice Cooper (originally the name of the band, but later taken over as the stage name / persona of singer and main songwriter Vince Furnier). The Alice Cooper band recorded two unsuccessful albums for Frank Zappa&#x27;s Warner-distributed label Straight Records before teaming with producer Bob Ezrin, who became a longtime collaborator. Their third LP &quot;Love it to Death&quot; (originally released on Straight and later reissued on Warner Bros.) reached No. 35 on the Billboard album chart and produced the hit single &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot;, which reached No. 21. Following the runaway success of their 1971 European tour Warner Bros. Records offered the band a multi-album contract; their first Warner Bros. album &quot;Killer&quot; sold well, with the single &quot;Halo of Flies&quot; making the Top 10 in the Netherlands, but it was their next album &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; (1972) that really put them on the map. The title song was a Top 10 hit in the US, reached No. 1 in the UK and became a radio staple, and the album went to No. 2 in the US and sold more than a million copies. &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; (1973) became their biggest success, going to No. 1 in both the US and the UK. The follow-up &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; (1973) was less successful, although the single &quot;Teenage Lament &#x27;74 was a Top 20 hit in the UK. Furnier split from the band in 1974 and signed to Warner Bros.&#x27; sister label, Atlantic as a solo artist, scoring further success with his solo albums and singles.

In 1973, Frank Zappa and manager Herb Cohen closed the Straight and Bizarre labels and established a new imprint, DiscReet Records, retaining their distribution deal with Warner Bros. Zappa&#x27;s next album &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; (1973) became the biggest commercial success of his career, reaching No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, and the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Yellow Snow&quot; was a minor hit and (at the time) his only single to make the Hot 100 chart. Zappa also enjoyed moderate commercial success with the live double album &quot;Roxy and Elsewhere&quot; (1974) and his next studio album &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; (1975), both of which reached the Top 30 on the Billboard album chart.

 WBR introduced a new label design for its LPs and singles in mid-1973. This design, which WBR would use until mid-1978, featured a multi-colored, idealized watercolor painting of a Burbank street lined by palms and eucalypts, and titled with the slogan &quot;Burbank, Home of Warner Bros. Records&quot;. According to the label&#x27;s official history, the design was copied from a similarly styled &quot;orange crate art&quot; fruit company label illustration created by an unknown commercial artist in the 1920s.

After several years as a &#x27;cult&#x27; artist, Randy Newman achieved his first significant commercial success as a solo artist with his 1974 album &quot;Good Old Boys&quot; which made the Top 40. His controversial 1977 single &quot;Short People&quot; was one of the surprise hits of the year, reaching No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;. On October 12, 1974, WBR and Phil Spector established Warner-Spector Records, but the label was short-lived and folded in 1977; most of its releases were reissues Philles Records recordings from the 1960s and the only new material released was two singles by the disco group Calhoon and a single by Cher.

In 1975 David Geffen was obliged to leave the company for health reasons, after being told that he had a terminal illness (although this later proved to be a false diagnosis). In his place, Joe Smith was promoted to become President of the combined Elektra/Asylum label. At this time Warner Bros. began to wind down the Reprise label. In 1976–77 almost all Reprise acts, including Fleetwood Mac, Gordon Lightfoot, Ry Cooder and Michael Franks were transferred to Warner Bros., leaving only Neil Young (who refused to move) and founder Frank Sinatra. Apart from these artists and some reissues, the Reprise label was dormant until it was reactivated in 1986 with the issue of the Dream Academy&#x27;s single &quot;The Love Parade&quot; on Reprise 28750.

By far the most successful of the Reprise acts who moved to Warner Bros. was Fleetwood Mac, whose massive success firmly established Warner Bros. in the front rank of major labels—although few would have predicted it from the band&#x27;s tumultuous history. Between 1970 and 1975 there were multiple lineup changes (with only two original members remaining by 1974), their album sales declined drastically, and a legal battle over the group&#x27;s name kept them off the road for over a year. However, just as Fleetwood Mac was switching labels in 1975, the group re-invigorated by the recruitment of new members Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The &#x27;new&#x27; Fleetwood Mac scored a string of US and international hits and their self-titled Reprise debut album was a huge success, reaching No. 1 in the US, charting for more than 30 weeks and selling more than 5 million copies. In 1977, their now-legendary &quot;Rumours&quot; took both group and Warner Bros. label to even greater heights—it generated a string of international hit singles and became the most successful album in the label&#x27;s history; it is currently ranked the 11th biggest selling album of all time and as of 2009 was estimated to have sold more than 40 million copies.

After a string of albums with the Faces and as a solo artist for Mercury Records in the early 1970s, British singer Rod Stewart signed with Warner Bros. in 1974, applied for American citizenship and moved to the US. Launching a sustained run of success, his Warner debut album &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot; (1975) was a major international hit, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard album chart and No. 1 in Australia, with the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot; going to No. 1 in the UK. His second WBR album &quot;A Night on the Town&quot; (1976) went to No. 2 in the US and No. 1 in Australia and produced three US Top 40 singles, including his first US No. 1 &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. &quot;Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free&quot; (1977) reached No. 2 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart and No. 1 in Australia and again produced three US Top 40 singles, including &quot;You&#x27;re in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)&quot;, which reached No. 4. &quot;Blondes Have More Fun&quot; (1978) went to No. 1 in the US and Australia, and produced two more Top 40 singles including his second US No. 1, &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; (although Stewart and co-writer Carmine Appice were later successfully sued for plagiarizing the song&#x27;s catchy melody hook from &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; by Brazilian songwriter Jorge Ben). Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection (1979) went to No. 1 in the UK and Australia, giving the singer a record-breaking five consecutive No. 1 albums in the latter country.

Warner Bros. Records also had unexpected success in the mid-1970s with another &#x27;heritage&#x27; act, veteran vocal group the Four Seasons. In early 1975, they signed with Curb Records (which was distributed by WBR) just as lead singer Frankie Valli scored a surprise hit with his independently released solo single &quot;My Eyes Adored You&quot;. Soon after, Valli and The Four Seasons burst back onto the charts with the disco-styled &quot;Who Loves You&quot;, which reached No. 3 in the US and sold more than a million copies, and the album &quot;Who Loves You&quot; sold more than 1 million copies. Their next single &quot;December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot; topped the charts in both Britain and the US in early 1976, becoming the group&#x27;s first US No. 1 since 1967. A remixed version was a hit again in 1994 and its total of 54 weeks in charts gives it the longest tenure of any song on the Billboard Hot 100.

By the time of The Doobie Brothers 1976 album &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;, founding member Tom Johnston had effectively left the band and he was replaced by former Steely Dan session man Michael McDonald, whose distinctive voice helped to propel the group to even greater success. The new album sold strongly, reaching No. 8 in the US, and the title track reached No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming a perennial on radio playlists. Warner Bros. also released the massively successful &quot;Best of the Doobies&quot; (1976), which has become one of the biggest-selling albums of all time and is currently accredited at 10× Platinum status. 1978&#x27;s &quot;Minute by Minute&quot; marked the peak of their career—both the album and its lead single &quot;What A Fool Believes&quot; went to No. 1 in the US and the album&#x27;s title track also made the US Top 20, although it was their last album with founding drummer John Hartman and long-serving guitarist Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter.

During the late 1970s, Warner Bros.&#x27; reputation as an &quot;artists first&quot; label was challenged by a bitter and long-running dispute with Frank Zappa. In 1976, Zappa&#x27;s relationship with manager Herb Cohen ended in litigation. For &quot;Zoot Allures, Z&quot;appa took his own copy of the master directly to Warner Bros. Records, who agreed to release the album, therefore bypassing Cohen and DiscReet. However, Warner Bros. changed their position following legal action from Cohen. Zappa was then obligated to deliver four more albums to Warner Bros. for release on DiscReet. Zappa sequenced a double live album and three studio albums, but Warner Bros. objected to some or all of these recordings and refused to reimburse Zappa for production costs, as required by the DiscReet distribution contract. Zappa then re-edited the material into a 4-LP set called &quot;Läther&quot; (pronounced &#x27;leather&#x27;), made a deal with Phonogram, and scheduled the release of &quot;Läther&quot; for Halloween 1977. However, Warner Bros. threatened legal action, forcing Zappa to shelve the release. Infuriated, Zappa hosted a broadcast on KROQ-FM in Pasadena, California, where he played the entire &quot;Läther&quot; album in sequence, repeatedly criticizing Warner Bros., and openly encouraging listeners to record the broadcast. Warner Bros. took further legal action against Zappa, which prevented him from issuing any material for over a year. During 1978 and 1979, Warner Bros. issued the disputed material over four albums – &quot;Zappa in New York&quot; (an edited and censored version of the original 1977 live double album), &quot;Studio Tan&quot;, &quot;Sleep Dirt&quot; and &quot;Orchestral Favorites&quot;. Zappa eventually won the rights to his Straight, Bizarre, DiscReet and Warner Bros. material, but remained trenchantly critical of his treatment by Warner Bros. for the rest of his life. Zappa&#x27;s recordings were subsequently reissued on CD by Rykodisc (ironically it was later acquired by Warner Music), including &quot;Läther&quot;, which appeared posthumously in 1996.

Ry Cooder was another Reprise act who was transferred to Warner Bros. in 1977. His first Warner release was the 1977 live album &quot;Showtime&quot; and he remained with the label until his contract expired in the late 1980s. His 1979 album &quot;Bop &#x27;Til You Drop&quot; is notable as the first major-label rock album to be digitally recorded, and it became the best-selling album of his career.

Thanks to its distribution deal with Curb Records, WBR scored the biggest hit single in the company&#x27;s history in 1977. The ballad &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; (written and produced by Joe Brooks) was originally recorded by the late Kasey Cisyk for the soundtrack to the film of the same name, in which actress Didi Conn lip-synched to Cisyk&#x27;s recording. Teenager Debby Boone (daughter of actor-singer Pat Boone) was recruited to record a new version for single release, and this became a massive success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-setting 10 consecutive weeks, and earning a Platinum certification from the RIAA. It became the most successful single of the 1970s in the United States, setting what was then a new record for longest run at No. 1 in the US and surpassing Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. Boone&#x27;s success also earned her Grammy nominations for &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance &quot; and &quot;Record of the Year&quot; and won her the 1977 Grammy for &quot;Best New Artist&quot; and the 1977 American Music Award for &quot;Favorite Pop Single&quot;. The song also earned Joe Brooks the 1977 &quot;Song of the Year&quot; Grammy (tied with &quot;Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)&quot;) as well as &quot;Best Original Song&quot; at both the 1977 Golden Globe and Academy Awards.

Throughout the 1970s, Warner Bros. also benefited from its US/Canada distribution deals with independent labels such as Straight Records, DiscReet Records, UK labels Chrysalis (1972–1976) and Island (1974–1982), Bizarre Records, Bearsville Records (1970–1984) and Geffen Records (which was sold to MCA in 1990).

Although primarily associated with mainstream white acts in the Seventies, Warner Bros.&#x27; distribution deals with smaller labels also brought it some success in the disco, soul and funk genres in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Among the imprints it distributed that were notable in these fields were Seymour Stein&#x27;s Sire Records (which Warner Bros. soon purchased), Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s Curtom, Norman Whitfield&#x27;s Whitfield Records, Quincy Jones&#x27; Qwest, Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park, RFC Records (formed in December 1978 when Ray Caviano became the executive director of Warner&#x27;s disco division), and Tom Silverman&#x27;s Tommy Boy Records (another label Warner Bros. eventually took over).

Until the late 1970s, Warner Bros. itself still had very few African American music artists on its roster, but this began to change with the signing of artists such as George Benson and Prince. Benson had risen to prominence in jazz in the 1960s but was still relatively little-known by the general public. However, his move to Warner Bros. in 1976 and the teaming with producer Tommy LiPuma enabled him to straddle genres and made him a popular and highly successful mainstream R&amp;B and pop artist. His first Warner Bros. album &quot;Breezin&#x27;&quot; (1976) became one of the most successful jazz albums of the decade and a major &#x27;crossover&#x27; hit—it topped the American Pop, R&amp;B and Jazz album charts and produced two hit singles, the title track (which became a Jazz standard and a radio favorite) and &quot;This Masquerade&quot;, which was a Top 10 pop and R&amp;B hit. Benson enjoyed enormous success with his subsequent Warner albums. All of his Warner albums made the Top 20 on the US jazz album chart and beginning with &quot;Breezin&quot;&#x27;, he scored seven consecutive US No. 1 jazz albums; the first five of these were also Top 20 hits on both the Pop and R&amp;B charts. His live version of Leiber &amp; Stoller&#x27;s &quot;On Broadway&quot; (from his 1978 live album &quot;Weekend in L.A.&quot;) outcharted the original version by the Drifters, reaching No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and gained further exposure thanks to its memorable use in the famous audition sequence in Bob Fosse&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;All That Jazz&quot;. Benson&#x27;s most successful single &quot;Give Me the Night&quot; (1980) became his first US No. 1 R&amp;B hit, reached No. 4 on the Pop chart and also reached No. 2 on the Hot Disco Singles chart.

Prince signed to Warner Bros. in 1977. His first album &quot;For You&quot; made little impact, although the single &quot;Soft and Wet&quot; reached No. 12 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart. However, his second self-titled album (1979) fared considerably better, reaching No. 3 on the R&amp;B album chart and earning a gold record award; the first single lifted from the album, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Lover&quot; became Prince&#x27;s first crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart and No. 11 on the main pop chart, while the follow-up single &quot;Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?&quot; reached No. 13 on the R&amp;B chart. Although he was still little known outside the US at this stage, this early success set the stage for his major commercial breakthrough in the 1980s.

Another valuable late 1970s discovery was metal-pop band Van Halen, who were spotted at a Hollywood club by Mo Ostin and Ted Templeman in 1977. Their self-titled debut album was a notable success, reaching No. 19 on the Billboard album chart, and their second album &quot;Van Halen II&quot; (1979) reached No. 6 and produced their first hit single &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; (#19).

Warner Bros. also began to tentatively embrace the burgeoning new wave movement in the late 1970s, signing cult bands Devo and the B-52s. A crucial acquisition in this field—and one which would soon prove to be of enormous importance to the company—was the New York-based Sire Records, founded in 1966 by Seymour Stein and Richard Gottehrer. Warner Bros. took over Sire&#x27;s distribution from ABC Records in 1977 and bought the label in 1978, retaining Stein as its president. The addition of the Sire roster gave Warner Bros. an important foothold in this area (indeed, Stein is often credited with naming the genre to replace the term &quot;punk&quot;, which he disliked); its American signings included the Ramones, the Dead Boys, and Talking Heads and most importantly of all, Madonna, who soon became the most successful female artist in music history, earning billions for Warner. Sire&#x27;s distribution deals with British independent labels including Mute, Rough Trade, Korova and Fiction gave WEA the American rights to important UK-based New Wave bands including Depeche Mode, the Smiths, the Beat, Madness, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and the Cure. Into the 1990s, the label had continued success with Seal, k.d. lang, Tommy Page, Ice-T, and Ministry.

In the late 1970s, Warner Bros. also scored mainstream pop hits with singer/actor Shaun Cassidy—his version of &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; went to No. 1 in the US in 1977, his next two singles (both penned by Eric Carmen) were US Top 10 hits and Cassidy was nominated for a Grammy award. As the decade drew to a close, there were more breakthroughs with new acts. Rickie Lee Jones&#x27; self-titled debut album went to No. 3 in the US, No. 1 in Australia and No. 18 in the UK and produced two hit singles, &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s In Love&quot; (US #4) and &quot;Young Blood&quot; (US #40). Thanks to its American distribution deal with Vertigo, British group Dire Straits provided another sustained run of hit albums and singles in the late 1970s and 1980s. Their eponymous debut album (1978) was a surprise international hit, going to No. 2 in the US and earning a gold record award from the RIAA, while the single &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; went to No. 4 in the US. Their second album &quot;Communiqué&quot; (1979) made the Top 20 in many countries and earned another gold record award in the US WBR also enjoyed renewed success with comedy recordings in this period, transferring Richard Pryor from Reprise and signing rising star Steve Martin, whose second Warner album &quot;A Wild and Crazy Guy&quot; (1978) became one of the label&#x27;s biggest comedy hits—it reached No. 2 on the pop album chart, won the 1979 Grammy for &#x27;Best Comedy Album&#x27;, and Martin&#x27;s novelty single, &quot;King Tut&quot; was a US Top 20 hit.

In the 1970s there were different systems for four-channel stereo. Warner Records and the whole WEA group chose JVC&#x27;s and RCA&#x27;s discrete system called CD-4 or Quadradisc. That was the system with the highest separation between the four channel, but the system needed a special stylus that could read frequences up to 48 000 Hz.

===1980–1988===
The 1980s was a period of unprecedented success for Warner Bros. Records. The golden decade began with the success of singer-songwriter Christopher Cross, whose self-titled debut album went to No. 6 in the US and produced four charting singles, including the No. 1 hit &quot;Sailing&quot;. He also won five major categories at the 1981 Grammy Awards, becoming the only solo artist to date to win the &quot;Big Four&quot; awards in one year (Record, Song and Album of the Year, and Best New Artist) while his performance of &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme&quot; from the Dudley Moore film &quot;Arthur&quot;, which also went to No. 1, won both the Oscar and the Golden Globe award for Best Original Song.

Warner Bros. scored an apparent coup in 1980 by luring Paul Simon away from Columbia Records. His first Warner album was &quot;One Trick Pony&quot; (1980), which accompanied the movie of the same name, which Simon wrote and starred in. The single &quot;Late in the Evening&quot; was a major hit (#6) but the album was not a big seller. His next album, &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; (1983) was well received by critics but neither it nor the lead single &quot;Allergies&quot; made the chart and Simon&#x27;s career took a nosedive and it was several more years before the label&#x27;s patience eventually paid off.

After two moderate-selling albums that established them as one of the most original American new wave bands of the period, DEVO broke through to mainstream success in 1980 with their third album &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; which reached No. 22 in the US. Thanks to its quirky music video, which was put on high rotation on MTV, the single &quot;Whip It&quot; reached No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart, becoming the group&#x27;s biggest American hit. Their follow-up EP &quot;DEV-O Live&quot; (1981) was a surprise hit in Australia, topping the singles chart there for three weeks, but their subsequent albums and singles suffered from declining sales and the group was eventually dropped by the label after their 1984 album &quot;Shout&quot;.

Prince&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; was widely praised by critics, earning a gold record award, but his 1982 double-LP &quot;1999&quot; (1982) became his first major hit album, selling over six million copies and spawning three hit singles. The title track reached No. 12 in the US and provided his first international hit (#25 UK) and his next two singles, &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; and &quot;Delirious&quot;, were both US Top 10 hits.

Chicago was picked up by Warner Bros. in 1981 after being dropped by its former label Columbia, which believed that the band was no longer commercially viable. After teaming with producer David Foster, the band shot back into the charts in 1982 with the album &quot;Chicago 16&quot;, which reached No. 9 and produced two hit singles including the US No. 1 hit &quot;Hard To Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;. The group&#x27;s second Warner album, &quot;Chicago 17&quot;, became the biggest seller of its career—it reached No. 4 in the US and produced four US Top-20 singles including the Top-5 hits &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; (#3) and &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot; (#3) and is currently accredited at 6× Platinum. Lead singer Peter Cetera left the group after this album but had continued success as a solo artist for Warner, scoring a No. 1 hit in 1986 with &quot;Glory of Love&quot; (from the movie &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;), which was also nominated for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. His second solo album sold more than a million copies and produced another No. 1 hit, &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;. His third solo album produced the Top 5 hit &quot;One Good Woman&quot; (1988) and &quot;After All&quot; reached No. 6.

Lenny Waronker took over as President of WBR in 1982, and his first act was to sign Elvis Costello. Costello&#x27;s first Warner album &quot;Spike&quot; featured his biggest American single, the Paul McCartney collaboration &quot;Veronica&quot;, which was a US Top 20 hit. He recorded three more critically praised albums for Warner Bros., &quot;Mighty Like A Rose&quot;, &quot;Brutal Youth&quot;, and &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot;, but he was dropped from the label after the major corporate shakeup in the mid-1990s.

After the end of his contract with RSO Records and Polydor, Eric Clapton signed with Warner Bros. in 1982. His first WBR album, &quot;Money and Cigarettes&quot; (1983), reached No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, and the single &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Heart&quot; reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100. His next album &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; also fared well, reaching No. 34 and the hit single &quot;Forever Man&quot; went to No. 26, but he transferred to Reprise for his next release.

Another resurgent 1970s act who scored major success with Warner Bros. in this period was ZZ Top, which had previously been signed to London Records. During an extended break in the late 1970s the group gained ownership of its London recordings and signed with Warner Bros., which also re-issued the band&#x27;s back-catalogue. The group&#x27;s first two Warner albums &quot;Deguello&quot; (1979) and &quot;El Loco&quot; (1981) were moderately successful, but &quot;Eliminator&quot; (1983) became a major hit thanks to strong support for its music videos on MTV. The band scored three US hit singles including &quot;Legs&quot; (US #8), while the album reached No. 9 on the Billboard 200 and sold in huge numbers, earning a Diamond record award in 1996. &quot;Afterburner (ZZ Top album)&quot; (1985) went to No. 4 and produced five hit singles, including &quot;Sleeping Bag&quot; (#8).

Sire artist Madonna shot to international prominence with her 1983 self-titled debut album and her first mainstream hit single &quot;Holiday&quot;, which reached No. 16 in the US and became a hit in many other countries, including Australia and the UK, where it was Top 5. The album made the Top 20 in more than a dozen countries including the US, where it has been certified at 5× Platinum status. It was quickly followed by &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, which became her first US No. 1 album and has sold more than 21 million copies worldwide. The title track was also a huge international hit, going to No. 1 in Australia, Canada, Japan and the US. Boosted by her well-received role in the film &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, &quot;Crazy For You&quot; (1985) became her second US No. 1 hit, and the follow-up &quot;Material Girl&quot; reached No. 2 in the US and was Top 5 in many other countries.

Prince&#x27;s hugely successful 1984 film and album &quot;Purple Rain&quot; cemented his stardom, selling more than thirteen million copies in the US (25 million worldwide) and spending twenty-four consecutive weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, while the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; film won the Academy Award for &quot;Best Original Song Score&quot; and grossed more than $80 million in the US. Singles from the album became hits on pop charts around the world; &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; both reached No. 1 and the title track reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, the sexually explicit album track &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; generated a major controversy that had lasting effects—when politician&#x27;s wife Tipper Gore heard her 12-year-old daughter listening to the song and investigated the lyrics, her outrage led to the formation of the conservative lobby group Parents Music Resource Center. Their stance was vehemently opposed by former Warner Bros. artist Frank Zappa and others, but the PMRC&#x27;s political clout eventually forced the US recording industry to adopt the compulsory practice of placing a &quot;Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics&quot; sticker on records deemed to contain &quot;offensive&quot; content.

1984 also saw Van Halen break into the big league with the single &quot;Jump&quot; (their only US No. 1 hit) and the album &quot;1984&quot;; it was a huge seller (earning Diamond album status in 1999) and reached No. 2 in the US, producing two more Top 20 hits. However, escalating friction between guitarist Eddie Van Halen and lead singer David Lee Roth reached breaking point soon after the album&#x27;s release and Roth left the band, to be replaced by Sammy Hagar, who recorded for WB as part of Montrose; &quot;1984&quot; was also the last time they worked with Ted Templeman, who had produced all their albums up to this point.

In 1985, Dire Straits&#x27; single &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; gained massive exposure on MTV thanks to its innovative computer-animated music video, propelling the single to No. 1 in the US. They scored two more US Top 20 hits with &quot;Walk of Life&quot; and &quot;So Far Away&quot; and the album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was a phenomenal success—it went to No. 1 in the US, Australia and most European countries and sold in colossal numbers—by 1996 it had been certified at 9× platinum in the US and it is currently ranked at No. 25 in the list of best-selling albums of all time, with sales of more than 30 million copies worldwide.

The new incarnation of Van Halen bounced back in 1986, releasing the enormously successful &quot;5150&quot; album which went to No. 1 and produced two hit singles, &quot;Why Can&#x27;t This Be Love&quot; (US #3) and &quot;Dreams&quot; (#22). Their three subsequent studio albums (&quot;OU812&quot;, &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;Balance&quot;) all reached No. 1 and the band scored 17 US Top 20 singles, including 1988&#x27;s &quot;When It&#x27;s Love&quot; (US #5), but their overall sales gradually declined, with each album selling less than its predecessor.

The same was true of Prince; he scored numerous hit albums and singles through the latter half of the 1980s, but his record sales declined and Warner Bros. executives became increasingly concerned that he was producing far more material than they could release. His image was also tarnished by the failure of his later film ventures, his embarrassing refusal to participate in the recording of &quot;We Are The World&quot; and his sacking of guitarist Wendy Melvoin and long-serving keyboard player Lisa Coleman. The 1985 album &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; held the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 for three weeks and peaked at No. 5 in the UK, selling seven million copies despite minimal promotion. &quot;Parade&quot; (1986) served as the soundtrack for Prince&#x27;s second film &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot;; although the movie was a critical and commercial failure, the album peaked at No. 3 in Billboard and No. 2 on the R&amp;B album charts and his classic single &quot;Kiss&quot; was another big international hit, going to No. 1 in the US and becoming a radio staple.

Prince&#x27;s next project had a long and complex evolution, beginning as a proposed concept double-album called &quot;Dream Factory&quot;; Prince then proposed a solo album which he intended to issue under the pseudonym &quot;Camille&quot;, but he eventually combined elements from both to create the ambitious three-album set &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;. However, because of the relatively lower sales of his previous albums, Prince&#x27;s manager Steve Fargnoli and Warner Bros. president Mo Ostin both doubted the commercial viability of releasing a 3-LP set, and after previewing &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;, Ostin insisted that Prince pare it down to two records. Prince at first refused and a battle of wills ensued for several weeks, but he eventually backed down and removed seven tracks; the resulting double-album was released in March 1987 as &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;. Despite Prince&#x27;s bitterness over its forced reduction, it was very successful, peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and selling 5 million copies, while the title single &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; reached No. 3 on the Hot 100. The follow-up single &quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot; flopped (although it went to No. 12 on R&amp;B chart) but he scored big hits with the next two singles, &quot;U Got the Look&quot; (#2 Hot 100, #11 R&amp;B) and &quot;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man&quot; (#10 Hot 100, #14 R&amp;B).

In 1985, the company collaborated with View-Master to start out a children&#x27;s video series &quot;Kidsongs&quot;, which were produced by Together Again Productions, and Warner Music Video handling distribution of the video product, designed for the educational market.

1986–87 took Warner Bros. to even greater heights. Madonna&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;True Blue&quot; produced three US number one hits and two top five singles, and the album topped the charts in more than 28 countries (a feat that earned her a place in the Guinness Book of Records); the album has sold over 25 million copies to date. After several years of career stagnation, Paul Simon burst back onto the music scene in late 1986 with Graceland. Warner Bros. were initially anxious about the commercial appeal of Simon&#x27;s innovative fusion of rock with African styles but the album was a resounding success, topping the charts in many countries, reaching No. 3 in the US and producing two US Top 20 singles. It became the best-selling American album of 1987 and the most successful of Simon&#x27;s solo career, selling more than 5 million copies, and winning the 1986 Grammy for &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27;; the title track also won &#x27;Song of the Year&#x27; in 1987. In jazz, Warner Bros. scored another artistic coup by signing jazz legend Miles Davis after his break with longtime label Columbia. His comeback album &quot;Tutu&quot; (1986) was a major crossover hit, gaining rave reviews and winning a Grammy in 1987. Also in 1986, smooth jazz pioneer Bob James moved to the label after a nine-year stint with Tappan Zee Records/Columbia, producing albums for Warner Bros. for the next sixteen years. The label would additionally reissue some of his back catalogue on CTI and Tappan Zee/Columbia in the mid-1990s.

In the summer of 1986, Warner Bros. announced the reactivation of Reprise Records with its own separate promotions department, and former Warner Bros. Vice President of Promotion Richard Fitzgerald was appointed as label Vice President.

During 1987, Prince recorded a pared-down funk album, &quot;The Black Album&quot;, but he withdrew it in December just before it was to be released (even though 500,000 copies had been printed). Its hastily recorded replacement &quot;Lovesexy&quot; (1988) was a moderate success, reaching No. 11 on the Billboard album chart although it reached No. 1 in the UK. However, he rebounded in 1989 with the soundtrack for the hugely successful &quot;Batman&quot; film, which sold more than eleven million copies, reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and produced four hit singles including &quot;Batdance&quot;, which topped both the Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts.

Like fellow Athens, Georgia natives the B-52s, R.E.M. was a &#x27;cult&#x27; band that gradually built up a strong following in the US and internationally during the 1980s (thanks in part to their innovative music videos). For most of the 1980s they were signed to the independent label IRS Records and in 1987, they broke out to mainstream success with the album &quot;Document&quot;, their first to sell more than one million copies. However, they were frustrated by IRS&#x27;s poor international distribution and when their IRS contract expired in 1988 they signed with Warner Bros. Their Warner debut &quot;Green&quot; established them as a major force, earning a platinum album and selling more than 4 million copies worldwide, and &quot;Stand&quot; became their first US hit single.

In 1989, after an extended period of inactivity following the death of guitarist and main writer Ricky Wilson, the B-52s shot back to prominence with the album &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;. It was a Top 5 hit in the US (#4) and the UK (#2) and went to No. 1 in Australia, where the group had enjoyed a strong following since their debut single &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;; they also scored three consecutive hit singles with &quot;Love Shack&quot; (#3 US, #1 Australia), &quot;Roam&quot; (US #3) and &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot; (US #30).

In early 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with Pepsi, and debuted her new single &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; in a commercial titled &quot;Make a Wish&quot;—the first time a pop single had debuted in an advertisement and the first time such a commercial was given a worldwide satellite premiere. The actual music video for &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; premiered on MTV the following day; it generated heated criticism due to its provocative use of religious imagery and was condemned by the Vatican. As a result, Pepsi withdrew the advertisement and canceled the endorsement deal, although Madonna was allowed to retain her US$5 million advance. The controversy also introduced heightened interest in the single and the album (also titled &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;). The single became Madonna&#x27;s seventh US number one hit, as well as topping the chart in more than 30 other countries, and the album has sold fifteen million copies worldwide.

===1989–2004: The Time Warner era===
In 1989 Time Inc. acquired Warner Communications and merged the two enterprises to create Time Warner in a deal valued at US$14 billion.

After a long period of relative stability that was notable in the cutthroat American music industry, the death of Steve Ross in late 1992 marked the start of a period of major upheaval at Warner Bros. Records.

R.E.M.&#x27;s second Warner album &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1991) consolidated their success, topping the charts in both the US and the UK and producing two major hit singles: &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; became their biggest American single (#4 on Billboard Hot 100) and a hit in numerous other countries, and &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, a Top 10 hit in both the US and the UK; the group also won three categories at that year&#x27;s Grammy Awards.

Prince&#x27;s fortunes in the Nineties were mixed; he scored more hits and renewed his contract in 1992, but his relationship with Warner Bros. Records soon soured, climaxing in a highly publicized legal battle and his eventual departure from the label. Although his fourth film, &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; was panned by critics and bombed at the box office the album of the same name was very successful—it reached No. 6 on both the Billboard Hot 200 and R&amp;B album chart and produced two US Top 20 singles. &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; (1991) became one of the biggest albums of his career, selling 9 million records, reaching No. 3 in the US, No. 2 in the UK and No. 1 in Australia, with five of the six singles lifted from the album becoming hits in the US and other countries, including &quot;Cream&quot;, which became his fifth US No. 1.

Prince was appointed a vice-president of Warner Bros. Records when he re-signed with them in 1992, but soon regretted his decision. His next album—identified by the cryptic symbol on the cover later defined as &quot;The Love Symbol&quot;—was another solid hit, peaking at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling 5 million copies worldwide, but by now tensions were increasing. Warner Bros. wanted to release &quot;7&quot; as his next single, but Prince successfully pushed for &quot;My Name Is Prince&quot; and it was only a minor hit (#36 Hot 100, #23 R&amp;B); the follow-up &quot;Sexy MF&quot; was censored in the US because of the expletive in the chorus and did not even make the US Top 50 although it was a Top 5 hit in the UK and Australia. When eventually released, &quot;7&quot; became the only major US hit lifted from the album, peaking (appropriately) at No. 7.

Following the 3-disc compilation &quot;The Hits/The B-Sides&quot; (1993), Prince stopped using his first name and started using only the &quot;Love Symbol&quot;—a decision that drew considerable ridicule from the media. Because this sign has no verbal equivalent, he was often derisively referred to as &quot;The Artist Formerly Known as Prince&quot;. By 1994, relations between The Artist and his record label had reached an impasse—in February WEA cancelled its distribution deal with Paisley Park, effectively putting the label out of business. Although released by an independent distributor, his next single &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; (1994) reached No. 3 in the US and topped the singles charts throughout Europe, becoming the biggest hit single of his career.

Prince had meanwhile prepared two new albums, &quot;Come&quot; and &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;; an early version of &quot;Come&quot; was rejected but Warner Bros. eventually accepted both albums, although they refused to issue them simultaneously. By this time Prince had launched a legal action to terminate his contract and gain ownership of his master recordings, and he publicized his views by appearing in public with the word &quot;SLAVE&quot; written across his right cheek. &quot;Come&quot; (1994) was moderately successful in the US (#15, gold record) and the single &quot;Letitgo&quot; reached No. 10 on the R&amp;B chart, although the album was a major hit in the UK, debuting at No. 1. In November Warner released a limited edition of &quot;The Black Album&quot;, but it was already widely bootlegged, sold poorly and was soon deleted. &quot;The Gold Experience&quot; (1995) was hailed by some reviewers as Prince&#x27;s best effort since &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;; it included &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; and produced two other charting singles, &quot;I Hate U&quot; (US #11 and &quot;Gold&quot; UK #10). Prince&#x27;s remarkable career with Warner Bros. ended with &quot;Chaos and Disorder&quot; (1996), compiled expressly to end his contract. It was one of his least successful releases but still managed to reach No. 26 in the US and No. 14 in the UK and produced one minor hit, &quot;Dinner With Delores&quot; (#36 UK). Prince subsequently released recordings on his own NPG label (via EMI) before eventually signing with Universal Music in 2005.

R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; (1992) cemented their status as one of the top bands of the period and was the most successful album of their career, reaching No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US, selling more than 10 million copies worldwide and generating three US hit singles, &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;.

During 1992 WBR faced one of the most serious controversies in its history over the provocative recording &quot;Cop Killer&quot; from the self titled album by Body Count, a rap metal band led by Ice-T. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the song (which mentions the Rodney King case) came out just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with King&#x27;s beating, which sparked the 1992 Los Angeles Riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight. Complaints escalated over the summer—conservative police associations called for a boycott of Time Warner products, politicians including President George H. W. Bush denounced the label for releasing the song, Warner executives received death threats, Time Warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the New Zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there. Although Ice-T later voluntarily reissued &quot;Body Count&quot; without &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, the furore seriously rattled Warner Music and in January 1993 WBR made an undisclosed deal releasing Ice-T from his contract and returning the &quot;Body Count&quot; master tapes to him. In the wake of the &quot;Cop Killer&quot; affair, Warner Bros. distanced itself from gangsta rap and in late 1995, it sold its 50% stake in Interscope Records and its controversial subsidiary Death Row Records (Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg) back to co-owners Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field. Iovine and Field quickly aligned Interscope with the Universal Music Group; the label, now known as Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M following the merger of several Universal imprints, is still run by Iovine today.

Some relief came later that year when comedian Jeff Foxworthy revived Warner Bros.&#x27; success with comedy recordings; his debut album &quot;You Might Be a Redneck If...&quot; was a major hit in the US and Canada, and both it and his follow-up album sold more than three million copies each.

====End of an era: Ostin and Waronker depart====
During 1994–1995, Warner Bros.&#x27;s successes and problems with its artists were overshadowed by a protracted period of highly publicized internecine strife, centering on Warner Music Group chairman Robert J. Morgado and his successor Michael J. Fuchs. In September 1993, Ostin began negotiations to renew his contract and it was at this point that Morgado unveiled his plan for a major corporate shakeup of the Warner group. This triggered a series of damaging corporate conflicts and in particular created a fatal rift between Morgado and Ostin. The first major casualty was Elektra chairman Bob Krasnow, who resigned abruptly in July 1994.

For many years Ostin had reported directly to Time Warner chairman Steve Ross (and then to Ross&#x27;s successor Gerald Levin) but Morgado now insisted that Ostin should report to him, and he established a new division, Warner Music US, headed by Doug Morris, to oversee the three main record labels. Fearing the loss of autonomy and worried that he would be obliged to implement Morgado&#x27;s &quot;slash-and-burn&quot; policy to streamline the label&#x27;s staff and artist roster, he refused to carry out Morgado&#x27;s orders and decided not to renew his contract. Ostin officially stepped down from Warner Bros. when his contract expired on December 31, 1994, although he stayed on as a senior consultant to Time Warner&#x27;s chairman until August 1995. He later commented:

Ostin&#x27;s departure sent shockwaves through the company and the industry, and elicited glowing tributes from colleagues and competitors like Joe Smith and Clive Davis, and musicians like Paul Simon and R.E.M. It also triggered an exodus of Warner executives who had joined the company primarily because of Ostin. Next to go was Lenny Waronker—he was initially designated to succeed Ostin as chairman but he ultimately declined the job and left WBR soon after. Following a period of uncertainty and speculation, the two joined forces to establish a new label, DreamWorks Records. Waronker was replaced by ex–Atlantic Records president Danny Goldberg, but his tenure proved short. Long-serving WBR executive Russ Thyret, who had joined the label in 1971 and worked closely with Mo Ostin for many years, was promoted to vice-chairman in January 1995.

Gerald Levin forced Morgado to resign in May 1995 and he was replaced by HBO chairman Michael J. Fuchs. Fuchs sacked Morris a month later (sparking a US$50m breach of contract suit) and Warner Music US was dissolved. Morris&#x27; removal led to speculation that Ostin was being courted to return to WBR, but these reports proved unfounded, since Ostin and Waronker moved to DreamWorks soon after. Morris moved to MCA Records.

Despite his close ties to Morris, Danny Goldberg was initially told he could remain as WBR president but he left the company in August 1995 after negotiating a settlement with Time Warner to terminate his five-year, US$20 million contract, which still had four years to run. He was subsequently appointed president of PolyGram subsidiary Mercury Records in October. Following Goldberg&#x27;s departure Russ Thyret was promoted to chairman, CEO and label president. Fuchs himself was forced out of Time Warner in November 1995. In May 1997, Phil Quartararo took over as president of WBR, only weeks after he had left EMI&#x27;s Virgin Records following a management shake-up there.

The departure of the team led by Ostin and Waronker also meant that many of the Warner artists whose careers they had nurtured and curated over the previous 30 years were now deprived of their patronage. As a result, by 2000 many of the &quot;flagship&quot; Warner acts of the Ostin/Waronker years left the label as their contracts expired. Ry Cooder was dropped in 1995 and Randy Newman followed Ostin and Waronker to DreamWorks, departing with a wry comment on his own status and the recent turmoil at Warner Bros.:

Although never rising beyond &quot;cult&quot; status in terms of his sales as a solo artist, one of the most notable survivors from the Ostin era was Van Dyke Parks, who continued to release albums on Warner Bros. – &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; (1989), the Brian Wilson collaboration &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot; (1995) and the live album &quot;&quot; (1998). In 2004 Parks reunited with Brian Wilson to complete their long-shelved collaboration, &quot;Smile&quot;, which was released on the Nonesuch label to universal critical praise, winning a Grammy award, and making the Top 20 in the US and Top 10 in the UK, where it earned a gold record award.

In early 2001, there was a major restructure of the Warner Music Group; about 600 positions were eliminated across the three labels, and an executive reshuffle led to the departures of Thyret and Quartararo (as well as Reprise president Howie Klein) and the hiring of then-Interscope president Tom Whalley as head of Warner Bros. Records. In August Whalley appointed Jeff Ayeroff as Creative Director of Warner Bros. Records and Creative Consultant to Warner Music Group. Ayeroff had previously been WBR&#x27;s Senior Vice-president and Creative Director from 1983 to 1986, overseeing many successful album covers and music videos in that period.

In 2002, Linkin Park won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for their single &quot;Crawling&quot; released under Warner Bros. Whereas they were also nominated for Best Rock Album for &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; which also turned out to be the best selling album of 2001 worldwide and Best New Artist. In 2004, the band was nominated for their song &quot;Session&quot; for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 2006 the band won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for the song &quot;Numb/Encore&quot; released under Warner Bros./Roc-A-Fella/Machine Shop.

===2004–2019: Warner Music Group===

In 2003, amid management disputes, sagging share prices and rising alarm about the impact of digital file sharing, Time Warner decided to unload its music operations. In March 2004, Time Warner&#x27;s music assets were acquired by a private equity group headed by Thomas H. Lee Partners, Lexa Partners (led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., who put up US$150 million drawn from his family&#x27;s stake in Vivendi), Bain Capital and Providence Equity Partners. The deal included an option that would allow Time Warner to buy back in if conditions proved favorable. Bronfman, Lee, Bain and Providence had reportedly recouped their investment by May 2006 through dividends, refinancing and a share offer floated in May 2005. 

The sale was followed by a major restructure over the first half of 2004, which wad aimed at slashing $27 million from the company&#x27;s budget. The cost-cutting measures included more than 1000 staff layoffs worldwide, the dropping of 80 artists, comprising more than half the Warner roster, and the restructuring of the company&#x27;s two &quot;boutique&quot; labels. Elektra was folded into Atlantic, and its sub-label Nonesuch was absorbed into the Warner Records label, although Elektra would be revived as an active label five years later. The restructure period was also marked by a short but widely publicised dispute between Warner and Madonna—although, notably, the label made public efforts to distance the dispute from their regular dealings with Madonna, who remained signed to Warner as a solo artist.

Following the private buyout of the music group, Madonna began talks with Warner management to dissolve the joint venture partnership in Madonna&#x27;s Maverick label, to allow the label to work with other companies. Founded in 1992, Maverick had scored a major success in 1995 with Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, and Madonna and her two partners, Guy Oseary and Ronnie Dashed, jointly held a controlling 60% stake. After the talks broke down, the trio sued the company; they alleged mismanagement, improper accounting and profit-taking, claiming that Maverick had earned $100m in profit for the group, and seeking to recover $200 million in alleged lost revenue, but the suit was settled in June that year, with Madonna selling most of her stake in Maverick to Warner for just $10 million.

In 2005, following the global restructure, Warner Music Australia scored a major coup when it acquired the assets of the Australian Festival Mushroom Group. That company had originated as Festival Records in Sydney in the 1952, and after its acquisition by Rupert Murdoch in 1961, Festival became one of the leading Australian record companies, recording and/or releasing much of the most significant Australian pop and rock music of the era on its flagship Festival label or via its subsidiary imprints. Festival also signed valuable licensing and distribution deals with major local independent pop labels such as Spin (NSW) and Clarion (WA), and it subsequently took over many of these labels and acquired their masters, greatly increasing its holdings of key Australian pop/rock recordings.

In the 1970s Festival signed a distribution deal with the fledgling Melbourne label Mushroom Records, founded by Michael Gudinski. Mushroom scored a key breakthrough in 1974–75 with Melbourne band Skyhooks, whose debut album &quot;Living in the Seventies&quot; became the highest-selling Australian album ever issued up to that time. Mushroom enjoyed enormous success in Australia from the late 1970s on, and although Gudinski later moved the label&#x27;s distribution to EMI for some years, the two companies were eventually merged—Festival acquired 49% of Mushroom in 1993 and bought the remainder when Gudinski sold his controlling share in 1998. Finally, in 2005, after multiple management reshuffles and a steady decline in revenue, News Ltd sold the group and its recording archive (said to contain over 20,000 master tapes) to Warner Music Australia for a reported AU$10 million.

Following the divestiture, WMG licensed the Warner Bros. trademarks, although this license could have been revoked if WMG came under control of a major motion picture studio.

After five years of dormancy, Elektra was revived as an active imprint in June 2009, although some artists who had been signed to prior to the label&#x27; shelving in 2004 (including Tracy Chapman) had continued to have their recordings issued as Elektra releases. In mid-2018, Elektra was detached from the Atlantic Records umbrella and reorganized into Elektra Music Group, once again operating as an independently managed frontline label of Warner Music.

In 2013, WMG acquired Parlophone Records from EMI as part of its sale to Universal Music Group. Most Parlophone artists (excluding Coldplay and Tinie Tempah, who were placed under Atlantic) were placed under Warner Bros. Records for US distribution.
Dan McCarroll was named president. He held the position until July 2017.

In October 2017, Aaron Bay-Schuck and Tom Corson were named co-chairmen of Warner Bros. Records, with Bay-Schuck serving as CEO and Corson COO. Corson joined the company in January 2018; Bay-Schuck began in the fall of that year. The Warner Bros. headquarters moved from Burbank to downtown Los Angeles in March 2019.

===2019–present: Warner Records===
On May 28, 2019, the label announced that it had changed its name to Warner Records, and unveiled a new logo—replacing the Warner Bros. shield with a wordmark and black circle (both partially cut off at the bottom). WMG explained that the new logo was meant to resemble the Earth, a record, and the Sun, and had &quot;artful simplicity and impactful typography that are ideally suited to the digital world&quot;. The change was necessitated by the upcoming expiration of WMG&#x27;s license to the Warner Bros. trademarks; after the sale of Warner Music Group in 2004 by Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery since 2022), the company had been granted a 15-year license to use the Warner Bros. name and shield logo. The new logo received mixed reviews, with marketing critics and former WMG employees lamenting the replacement of the historic Warner Bros. emblem (used by the label for 61 years) with a comparatively simplistic mark. However, the record label&#x27;s ISRC code remains &quot;WB1&quot;.

On May 31, 2022, a partnership was announced with the South Korean entertainment company SM Entertainment for K-pop girl group Aespa&#x27;s global promotions.

<doc id="935938" wikidata="Q233565" url="?curid=935938" title="Denis Law">
<text>Denis Law (24 February 1940 – 17 January 2025) was a Scottish footballer who played as a forward. His career as a football player began at Second Division Huddersfield Town in 1956. After four years at Huddersfield, he was signed by Manchester City for an estimated transfer fee of £55,000, which set a new British record. Law spent one year there before Torino bought him for £110,000, this time setting a new record fee for a transfer involving a British player. Although he played well in Italy, he found it difficult to settle there and signed for Manchester United in 1962, setting another British record transfer fee of £115,000.

Law spent 11 years at Manchester United, where he scored 237 goals in 404 appearances. His goals tally places him third in the club&#x27;s history, behind Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton. He was nicknamed &quot;The King&quot; and &quot;The Lawman&quot; by supporters, and &quot;Denis the Menace&quot; by opposing supporters. Law was also known as part of the &quot;United Trinity&quot;, along with Charlton and George Best. He is the only Scottish player to have won the Ballon d&#x27;Or award, doing so in 1964, and helped his club win the First Division in 1965 and 1967, as well as the FA Cup in 1963 and two Charity Shields. He missed their European Cup final triumph in 1968 through injury.

Law left Manchester United in 1973 to return to Manchester City for a season, and represented Scotland at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. He played only two competitive games in the 1974–75 season, retiring before the start of the League programme proper. Law played for Scotland a total of 55 times and jointly holds the Scottish international record goal tally with 30 goals. Law holds a Manchester United record for scoring 46 competitive goals in a single season.

==Early life==
Denis Law was born in Aberdeen, Scotland on 24 February 1940, to George Law, a fisherman, and his wife, Robina; he was the youngest of seven children, four boys and three girls. The Law family were poor and lived in a council tenement flat at Printfield Terrace in Woodside. He went barefoot until he was 12 years old and wore handed-down shoes throughout his adolescence; his first pair of football boots came as a second-hand birthday present from a neighbour, which he received as a teenager.

Law supported Aberdeen and watched them when he had enough money to do so, watching local non-league teams when he did not. His obsession with football led to him turning down a place at Aberdeen Grammar School, because he would have had to play rugby there; instead, he attended Powis Academy in Aberdeen. Despite having a serious squint, he showed great promise once he was moved from full back to inside-left, and was selected for Scotland Schoolboys.

==Club career==

===Huddersfield Town===
In the 1954–55 season, he was spotted by Archie Beattie, a scout for Huddersfield Town, who invited 14-year-old Law to go for a trial. When he got there, the manager said, &quot;The boy&#x27;s a freak. Never did I see a less likely football prospect – weak, puny and bespectacled.&quot; However, to Law&#x27;s surprise, they signed him on 3 April 1955. While he was at Huddersfield, he had an operation to correct his squint, which greatly enhanced his self-confidence.

Huddersfield&#x27;s relegation to what was then the Second Division made it easier for Law to get a game, and he made his debut on 24 December 1956, aged only sixteen, in a 2–1 win over Notts County. Manchester United&#x27;s manager Matt Busby shortly offered Huddersfield £10,000 for Law (), a substantial amount of money for a teenage footballer at that time, but the club turned the offer down. Bill Shankly was manager of Huddersfield between 1956 and 1959, and when he left for Liverpool he wanted to take Law with him, but Liverpool were unable to afford him at that time.

===Manchester City===
In March 1960, Law signed for Manchester City for what was then a British record transfer fee, estimated to be £55,000 () although Law&#x27;s share of the fee was &quot;precisely nothing&quot;. Once again, Busby had attempted to sign Law for Manchester United, but United&#x27;s cross-city rivals beat them to Law&#x27;s signature.

City had narrowly avoided relegation from Division 1 the previous season, and Law genuinely felt that Huddersfield had a better team at the time. He made his debut on 19 March, and scored in a 4–3 defeat to Leeds United. In April 1961, he scored two goals in a 4–1 win over Aston Villa that ensured City&#x27;s survival in Division One.

Although he had thought about leaving, he was playing well and in 1961 Law scored six goals in an FA Cup tie against Luton Town. However, the match was abandoned with twenty minutes to go, so his six goals did not count. Luton won the replay 3–1, and City were knocked out of the Cup; Law had scored City&#x27;s goal.

Although he enjoyed his time at City, he wanted to play in a more successful side and was sold to the Italian club Torino in the summer of 1961 for a British record of £110,000.

===Torino===
Law moved to Torino for a fee of £110,000 (), establishing a record fee for a transfer involving a British player, and was accompanied by Joe Baker who had signed from Scottish side Hibernian. Another Italian club, Internazionale, tried to prevent him becoming a Torino player as soon as he arrived, claiming he had signed a pre-contract agreement with them, although they dropped this claim before the season started.

Players in the UK were not treated well at the time, and the maximum wage for footballers had only recently been abolished, so Law was pleasantly surprised to find that pre-season training was based in a luxury hotel in the Alps. However, Torino used performance-related pay scheme, giving the players large sums of money when the team won, but little, if any, when they lost. Like many British footballers who have gone to play in Italy, Law did not like the style of football and found adapting to it difficult. The ultra-defensive &quot;catenaccio&quot; system was popular there at the time, so forwards did not get many chances to score.

On 7 February 1962, he was injured in a car crash when his teammate Joe Baker drove the wrong way around a roundabout and clipped the curb as he tried to turn the car around, flipping it over. Baker was almost killed, but Law&#x27;s injuries were not life-threatening.

By April, he had put in a transfer request, which was ignored. The final straw for Law came in a match against Napoli when he was sent off. After the match, he was told that Torino&#x27;s coach, Beniamino Santos, had instructed the referee to send him off because he was angry at Law for taking a throw in, which he had been told not to do. Law walked out, and was told that he would be transferred to Manchester United. A few days later, however, he was told that he was being sold to Juventus and that the small print in his contract committed him to going there whether he wanted to or not. He responded by flying home to Aberdeen, knowing that Torino would not get a penny in transfer fees if he refused to play at Juventus. He eventually signed for United on 10 July 1962, for a new British record fee of £115,000.

The lifestyle and culture of a foreign country was an eye-opener for the young Scotsman, and the medical expertise and sports science in Italy was far ahead of what was available in the UK at the time. Ultimately though, Law found the football to be joyless and overly defensive, with him being subjected to violent man marking and heavy tackling on a frequent basis. His total of 10 Serie A goals stood as a record for a Scottish player until Lewis Ferguson of Bologna surpassed it 61 years later.

===Manchester United===
====Glory years====
Law moved back to Manchester, boarding with the same landlady with whom he had lived during his time as a City player. His first match for United was against West Bromwich Albion on 18 August 1962, and he made an excellent start, scoring after only seven minutes. The match finished in a 2–2 draw. However, United&#x27;s form had been erratic since the Munich air disaster in 1958, and because of their inconsistency they spent the season fighting relegation. In a league match against Leicester City, Law scored a hat-trick but United still lost. They found form in the FA Cup though, with Law scoring another hat-trick in a 5–0 win against his old club Huddersfield Town, and they went on to reach the final against Leicester City. Leicester were favourites, having finished fourth in the league, but Law scored the first goal as United won 3–1 in what turned out to be the only FA Cup final of his career. He also married his wife Diana that season, on 11 December 1962.

An incident took place that season that Law felt had repercussions in later years. In a match against West Brom on 15 December 1962, the referee Gilbert Pullin consistently goaded Law with taunts such as &quot;Oh, you clever so and so, you can&#x27;t play&quot;, and after the match, Law and his manager Matt Busby reported the matter to the Football Association. A disciplinary committee decided that Pullin should be severely censured, but he did not accept their verdict and quit the game. Law later said that &quot;in the eyes of some referees, I was a marked man&quot; and blamed the incident for the &quot;staggeringly heavy punishments&quot; that he received later in his career.

Law scored a number of goals early in the 1963–64 season and was selected to play for a &quot;Rest of the World&quot; side against England at Wembley, scoring their goal in a 2–1 defeat. He later described this as the greatest honour of his career. His season was interrupted by a 28-day suspension for a sending off that he received against Aston Villa. The unusually cold winter forced United to play many of their fixtures in a short time, and their results suffered. Law later blamed this for United&#x27;s failure to win a trophy in that season. Despite the lack of silverware, Law enjoyed a prolific goalscoring season and finished the campaign with 46 goals in all competitions, still a club record today.

In 1964–65, Law won the Ballon d&#x27;Or award, and Manchester United won their first league title since Munich. Law&#x27;s 28 league goals that season made him the First Division&#x27;s top scorer.

The following season, Law injured his right knee while playing for Scotland against Poland on 21 October 1965. He had previously had an operation on the same knee while at Huddersfield, and the injury was to trouble him for the rest of his career.

In 1966, Law asked United&#x27;s manager Matt Busby to give him a pay rise at his next contract renewal, and threatened to leave the club if he did not get one. Busby immediately placed Law on the transfer list, announcing that &quot;no player will hold this club to ransom, no player&quot;. When Law went to see him, Busby pulled out a written apology for him to sign, showing it to the press once he had done so. Law later said that Busby had used the incident to warn other players not to do the same thing, but had secretly given him the pay rise. Law scored 23 goals in 36 league appearances during 1966–67, helping United win the league title again.

In 1968, United won the European Cup for the first time, but Law&#x27;s knee injury was causing him serious problems. He missed both the semi-final second leg and the final as a result, with John Aston taking his place for the final. Law was regularly given cortisone injections to ease the pain, but playing while the knee was still injured was causing long-term damage. He visited a specialist in January 1968 who wrote to United claiming that a previous operation to remove the cartilage from the knee had failed and recommending that a second operation be performed, but Law was not shown the report for several years and had to continue full training.

In 1968–69, United reached the semi-final of the European Cup, playing AC Milan. United lost the first leg in the San Siro 2–0, winning the second leg at Old Trafford 1–0 with a Bobby Charlton goal. Having scored seven times in the 10–2 aggregate first round victory over Waterford United, Law finished as top scorer in the tournament with 9 goals.

====Injury problems====
Wilf McGuinness took over as first team coach at the start of the 1969–70 season. United finished eighth in the league, but Law missed almost all of the season through injury, and in April 1970 he was transfer listed for £60,000. Nobody made a bid for him, so he stayed at United.

After a poor 1970–71 season, United appointed Frank O&#x27;Farrell as manager. They made a good start to the 1971–72 season and finished 1971 five points clear at the top of the league, with Law having scored twelve goals. However, results deteriorated and they finished the season in eighth place. Law scored in the first match of the following season, 1972–73, but his knee injury was troubling him again, and he failed to score for the rest of the season. The poor results continued and O&#x27;Farrell was dismissed in December 1972 after a 5–0 defeat by Crystal Palace.

Law recommended that United replace O&#x27;Farrell with Tommy Docherty, whom he knew from his time playing with the Scottish national side. The club followed his recommendation, and things started well, with the team&#x27;s improved results lifting them into mid-table. Law was given a free transfer by Tommy Docherty in the summer of 1973, after 11 years at the club during which he had scored a total of 237 goals in 404 games in all competitions, as well as collecting two league title medals and an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal. Only Bobby Charlton (who retired in 1973) and Wayne Rooney have scored more goals for United.

===Return to Manchester City===
Law was offered a contract by Manchester City manager Johnny Hart. He scored two goals on his second debut for City, against Birmingham City in the opening game of the 1973–74 season. He made 27 full appearances and two as substitute in that season, including City&#x27;s 2–1 defeat in the League Cup final against Wolves. In City&#x27;s last game of the 1973–74 season against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Law&#x27;s 81st-minute back-heeled goal gave City a 1–0 lead but, thinking his goal might relegate United, Law did not celebrate the goal. Results of the day&#x27;s other matches meant that United were relegated whatever their result, but Law did not know that at the time. A number of pitch invasions by United fans followed, and Law walked off the pitch with his head down as he was substituted. The pitch invasions forced the referee to abandon the game in the 85th minute. After a review, the Football League decided that the result should stand.

Law had a contract with Manchester City for the 1974–75 season, but new manager Tony Book told him that he would only be playing reserve team football if he stayed at the club. He did not want to end his career in this way, so he retired from professional football in the summer of 1974. Law played two games for Manchester City in the 1974–75 season, in the pre-season Texaco Cup tournament, scoring the last goal of his career in the game against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on 6 August 1974. His last professional game was the 2–1 victory against Oldham Athletic at Maine Road on 10 August 1974. He formally retired on 26 August 1974.

==International career==
Law was not chosen to play for Scotland in the 1958 FIFA World Cup, but was given his debut in a British Home Championship match against Wales on 18 October 1958 by Matt Busby, who managed Scotland on a temporary basis for two matches. Law scored Scotland&#x27;s second goal in a 3–0 win over the Welsh at Ninian Park. He played but did not score in Scotland&#x27;s match against England on 15 April 1961. Scotland lost the match 9–3, and Law described it as his &quot;blackest day&quot;. 

Law was chosen for the Rest of the World team that faced England in the FA Centenary match in 1963. Law scored the only goal for Rest of the World as England won 2–1.

Law injured his right knee while playing for Scotland against Poland on 21 October 1965. Law scored in Scotland&#x27;s famous 3–2 victory over England on 15 April 1967 in the 1967 British Home Championship, less than a year after England had become world champions. Manchester United won the league that season, but Law felt that the victory over England was even more satisfying.

Scotland reached the World Cup finals in the summer of 1974, for the first time since 1958. Although he had not played much first team football in the preceding season, Law was included in the squad and played in their first match, against Zaire. He did not score, but Scotland won 2–0. Law was &quot;very disappointed&quot; not to be picked for the following match against Brazil, and was not selected for the following match against Yugoslavia either. Although Scotland were not defeated in any of their matches, they did not qualify for the second phase and were out of the World Cup. The match against Zaire proved to be the last of Law&#x27;s 55 appearances for Scotland.

Law jointly holds the Scottish international record goal tally with 30 goals.

==Personal life==
Law first met his wife, Diana, in an Aberdeenshire dancehall when they were both teenagers. They married in December 1962 and went on to have five children. Their daughter, also called Diana, worked for several years in the Manchester United press office.

Since retiring as a player, Law often worked on radio and television summarising and presenting games. He was one of the first sport news presenters of &quot;Granada Reports&quot; and was the sub-presenter of Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Kick Off Match&quot;, the equivalent of LWT&#x27;s &quot;The Big Match&quot;. He appeared as a special guest on the TV guest show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 19 February 1975, months after retiring as a player.
He was made an Inaugural Inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game. On 23 February 2002, a statue of Law (alongside George Best and Bobby Charlton) was unveiled at Old Trafford, in the part of the stadium known as the Scoreboard End. He had a successful operation to treat prostate cancer in November 2003 and was awarded honorary degrees from the Universities of Aberdeen and St. Andrews in 2005, and Robert Gordon University in 2017.

The emergence of Dutch international Dennis Bergkamp in the 1990s uncovered a story that the player&#x27;s parents were fans of Law and named their son after him. However, Dutch authorities refused to recognise the name unless it was spelt with two &quot;n&quot;″s as they felt it was otherwise too similar to the female name &quot;Denise&quot;.

On 25 November 2005, Law was at the bedside of former United teammate George Best as he died of multiple organ failure.

In May 2008, at the City of Manchester Stadium, he (with UEFA president Michel Platini) presented the medals to the winners of the UEFA Cup, Zenit Saint Petersburg, and their opponents, Scottish side Rangers.

In February 2010, Law was named as patron of the UK based charity Football Aid, taking over from the late Sir Bobby Robson.

In 2012, he established the Denis Law Legacy Trust, a registered charity that operates programmes and activities focussed around community engagement and widening sporting participation. The charity aims to reduce instances of youth crime and anti-social behaviour; promote health and wellbeing and encourage inclusivity through sport, physical activity and creative endeavour collaborating on community projects like Scotland&#x27;s first Cruyff Court in Aberdeen.

In 2012, a statue to Law, commissioned by the Denis Law Legacy Trust, was unveiled at the entrance to Aberdeen Sports Village (a facility he had formally opened two years earlier) depicting his pose after scoring for Scotland against England in 1967.

Law was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to football and charity. In 2017, he received the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen.

On 18 November 2021, Law and Sir Alex Ferguson unveiled a second statute of Law in Aberdeen, created in bronze by sculptor Alan Herriot. Commissioned by Aberdeen City Council, it is located next to Provost Skene&#x27;s House, in Marischal Square.

===Illness and death===
In August 2021, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and vascular dementia.

Law died on 17 January 2025, at the age of 84.

<text>The second Anglo-Sikh war was a military conflict between the Sikh Empire and the East India Company which took place from 1848 to 1849. It resulted in the fall of the Sikh Empire, and the annexation of the Punjab and what subsequently became the North-West Frontier Province, by the East India Company.

On 19 April 1848, Patrick Vans Agnew of the civil service and Lieutenant William Anderson of the Bombay European regiment, having been sent to take charge of Multan from Diwan Mulraj Chopra, were murdered there; within a short time, the Sikh troops joined in open rebellion. Governor-General of India Lord Dalhousie agreed with Sir Hugh Gough, the commander-in-chief, that the British East India Company&#x27;s military forces were neither adequately equipped with transport and supplies, nor otherwise prepared to take the field immediately. He also foresaw the spread of the rebellion, and the necessity that must arise, not merely for the capture of Multan, but also for the entire subjugation of the Punjab. He therefore resolutely delayed to strike, organized a strong army for operations in November, and himself proceeded to the Punjab. Despite the brilliant successes gained by Herbert Edwardes against Mulraj, and Gough&#x27;s indecisive victories at the Battle of Ramnagar in November and at the Battle of Chillianwala on 13 January 1849, the stubborn resistance at Multan showed that the task required the utmost resources of the government. At length, on 22 January, Multan was taken by General Whish, who was thus set at liberty to join Gough&#x27;s army. On 21 February, Gough won a complete victory at the Battle of Gujrat. The Sikh army was pursued to Rawalpindi, where it laid down its arms, and their Afghan allies retreated from the Punjab.

After the victory at Gujrat, Lord Dalhousie annexed the Punjab for the East India Company in 1849. For his services the Earl of Dalhousie received the thanks of the British parliament and was advanced in the peerage to marquess, the usual honor for governors general of India.

==Background==

The Sikh Confederacy Misls of the Punjab were consolidated into an Empire and expanded by Maharaja Ranjit Singh during the early years of the nineteenth century. During the same period, the British East India Company&#x27;s territories had been expanded until they were adjacent to the Punjab. Ranjit Singh maintained an uneasy alliance with the East India Company, while increasing the military strength of the Sikh Khalsa Army to deter British aggression against his state and to expand Sikh territory to the north and north west, capturing territory from Afghanistan and Kashmir.

When Ranjit Singh died in 1839, the Sikh Empire began to fall into disorder. There was a succession of short-lived rulers at the central Durbar (court), and increasing tension between the Army, which also saw itself as the embodiment of the state and religion, and the Durbar. The East India Company began to build up its military strength on the borders of the Punjab. Eventually, the increasing tension goaded the Sikh Army to invade British territory, under weak and possibly treacherous leaders.

The hard-fought first Anglo-Sikh war ended in defeat for the Sikh army.

===Aftermath of the first Anglo-Sikh war===
At the end of the war, the Sikh Empire was forced to cede some valuable territory (the Jullundur Doab) to the East India Company, and Gulab Singh, the ruler of Jammu, was allowed to acquire entire Jammu and Kashmir from the Sikh Empire by a large cash payment to the East India Company. Some of the Sikh Army were forced to make an expedition to oust the Governor of Kashmir in favour of Gulab Singh.

The boy Maharaja Duleep Singh of the Sikh Empire was allowed to retain his throne, but a British Resident, Sir Henry Lawrence, controlled the policy of the Durbar. Duleep Singh&#x27;s mother, Maharani Jind Kaur, continually tried to regain some of her former influence as Regent and was eventually exiled by Lawrence. While some Sikh generals and courtiers welcomed her dismissal, others resented Lawrence&#x27;s action. Furthermore, the Sikh Sardars were forced to considerably reduce their territorial and judicial control leaving only four Sardars in charge of the judiciary, with Sardar Chattar Singh Attariwalla controlling the area between the Jhelum and the Indus, Sardar Kahan Singh Mann controlling Lahore, Sardar Ram Singh Jallawala controlling the Chaj Doab, and Sardar Lehna Singh Majithia controlling the Majha including lands south east of the Ravi up to the hills and down to Kasur.

Some of the Sikh Army had to be kept in being, since many predominantly Muslim areas of the Sikh Empire threatened to ally with Dost Mohammed Khan in Afghanistan or to lapse into disorder, and only force of arms could keep them in subjugation. The British were unwilling to incur the financial and manpower costs of using large numbers of British or Bengal Army units for this task. To the contrary, the Governor-General of India, Viscount Hardinge sought to make economies after the war by reducing the size of the Bengal Army by 50,000 men. The Sardars (generals) of the Sikh Army naturally resented carrying out the orders of comparatively junior British administrators.

Early in 1848, Sir Henry Lawrence, who was ill, departed on leave to England. Although it was assumed that his younger brother John Lawrence would be appointed in his place, Lord Dalhousie, who had replaced Lord Hardinge as Governor-General, appointed Sir Frederick Currie instead. Currie was a legalist, based in Calcutta, who was unfamiliar with military matters and with the Punjab. While the Lawrences were comparatively informal and familiar with the junior officers who were Residents and Agents in the various districts of the Punjab, Currie was stiffer in manner and was inclined to treat his subordinates&#x27; reports with caution. In particular, he refused to act on reports from James Abbott, the Political Agent in Hazara, who was convinced that Sardar Chattar Singh Attariwalla was actively plotting a rebellion with other Sirdars.

==Sikh rebellions==

===Multan rebellion===
The city of Multan was part of the Sikh kingdom, having been captured by Ranjit Singh in 1818. In 1848, it was governed by a Hindu viceroy, Dewan Mulraj. After the end of the First Anglo-Sikh war, Mulraj had behaved independently. When he was required by the British-controlled Durbar in Lahore to pay an increased tax assessment and revenues which were in arrears, Mulraj attempted to give up power to his son, so as to maintain his family&#x27;s position as rulers. Currie instead appointed Sardar Kahan Singh Mann to succeed to the governorship and appointed a British Political Agent, Lieutenant Patrick Vans Agnew, to accompany him.

On 18 April 1848, Kahan Singh and Vans Agnew arrived at Multan with another officer, Lieutenant William Anderson, and a small escort. Mulraj handed over the keys of the fortress, but as Vans Agnew&#x27;s party attempted to take possession, they were attacked by a party of Mulraj&#x27;s irregular troops, and a mob from the city. Both officers were wounded, and were rescued by Kahan Singh. They were taken to a mosque outside the city. Their escorts defected to Mulraj, and the two officers were murdered by the mob the next day.

Mulraj later claimed that he had not instigated these attacks, but he was committed to rebellion because of them. He presented Vans Agnew&#x27;s head to Kahan Singh and told him to take it back to Lahore. The news of the killings spread over the Punjab, and unrest and disquiet increased. Large numbers of Sikh soldiers deserted the regiments loyal to the Durbar to join those prepared to rebel under the leadership of Mulraj and disaffected Sirdars.

====Battle of Kinyeri====
Lieutenant Herbert Edwardes, the British Political Agent in Bannu, had been near Multan in April but was unable to save Vans Agnew. He hastily levied some Pakhtun irregular troops.

On 18 June 1848, 8,000 Bhawalpuris under Futteh Mohammed Khan, aided by 3,000 Sikh irregulars under Lieutenant Edwardes, fought 8,000 Sikhs under Rung Ram. The Bhawalpuris were repulsed in an attack on the Sikh positions, but the arrival of Lieutenant Edwardes&#x27; guns turned the scale towards the favour of the Bhawalpuris, and at a second attempt the entrenchments were stormed and captured, with a loss to the victors of 300 men. The Sikhs lost 500 killed in the action, and many more during their flight to Multan.

====Battle of Suddusain====
Fought 1 July 1848, when a force of Bhawalpuris and British 18,000 strong, under Lieutenant Edwardes, encountered 12,000 Sikhs under Malraj. The Sikhs attacked, but were beaten off, largely owing to the superiority of the British artillery, and defeated with heavy loss. The Bhawalpuris then proceeded to chase the remaining scattered Sikhs all the way to Multan.

====Siege of Multan====
Multan, defended by the Sikhs, under Mulraj, was besieged by Lieutenant Edwardes with about 1,200 men in July 1848.

On learning of the events at Multan, Currie wrote to Sir Hugh Gough, the Commander in Chief of the Bengal Army, recommending that a major British force should at once move upon Multan. However Gough, supported by Dalhousie, the Governor General, declined to order major units of the East India Company to the Punjab until the end of the hot weather and monsoon seasons, which would not be until November. Instead, Currie ordered only a small force from the Bengal Army under General Whish, and several contingents of locally recruited irregulars and detachments of the Sikh Khalsa Army to join the siege. These forces joined Edwardes at Multan between 18 and 28 August. To the alarm of several Political Agents, the force from the Sikh Army included a large contingent commanded by Sardar Sher Singh Attariwalla, Chattar Singh&#x27;s son.

Some Political Agents were already taking action to forestall outbreaks of rebellion. Captain John Nicholson, leading irregular cavalry based at Peshawar, seized the vital fort of Attock on the Indus River from its Sikh garrison while they were still unprepared, or undecided on rebellion. Nicholson&#x27;s force then linked up with James Abbott&#x27;s local Hazara levies to capture the Margalla Hills which separated Hazara from the other parts of the Punjab. When Chattar Singh openly rebelled in August, his force was unable to leave Hazara without fighting a battle. Although Chattar Singh twice succeeded in capturing the passes through the hills, he nevertheless failed to take advantage of this (possibly because of dissension among his senior officers and continual harassment by pro-British irregulars), and retreated into Hazara.

On 14 September, Sher Singh&#x27;s army openly rebelled at Multan. He did not join Mulraj however. He and Mulraj conferred at a carefully chosen neutral site, at which it was agreed that Mulraj would give some money from his treasury to Sher Singh&#x27;s army, which would march north into the Central Punjab and ultimately rejoin Chattar Singh. Meanwhile, Whish was forced to raise the siege on 22 September.

As the cold weather began in November, substantial contingents from the East India Company&#x27;s armies at last took the field. A contingent from the Bombay Army (administered separately from the Bengal Army) had been ordered to reinforce Whish and besiege Multan. This force was delayed by a petty squabble over seniority and could arrive only when its first commander (who was senior to Whish and refused to serve under him) was replaced by a more junior officer. Whish&#x27;s army was supplied and reinforced by sea and river transport up the rivers Indus and Chenab. Whish renewed the siege of Multan on 27 December, with 17,000 men and 64 guns. After a heavy bombardment the city was stormed on 2 January 1849. On 22 January, Mulraj surrendered the citadel. He was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. The ending of the siege allowed Whish, with large numbers of heavy guns, to reinforce the army under Sir Hugh Gough.

The British loss during the siege was 210 killed and 910 wounded.

===Lahore rebellion===

====Battle of Rungur Muzl Fort====
Rungur Muzl fort was controlled by Sher Singh Attariwalla and was the first sign of revolt from the Lahore Durbar. The Sikhs from the army saw the British troops coming in and attacked them with full force. The Sikhs won the battle but soon they surrendered as there was a very small force.

====Siege of Shahpur Kandi Fort====
On the night of 14 August 1848, Wazir Ram Singh Pathania with his small Rajput army attacked the fort of Shahpur Kandi which was situated on the bank of river Ravi and held it, but after the siege of fort from 3 to 18 September 1848 by a strong force of John Lawrence from Hoshiarpur, he along with 400 of his band took shelter at Rasual (Gujrat) Camp of The Sikh Commander Sher Singh Attariwalla and Basakha Singh.

====Battle of Ramnagar====

Sir Hugh Gough led his main force against Sher Singh&#x27;s army, which defended the line of the River Chenab for several weeks. On 22 November, the Sikhs repelled a British cavalry attack on a bridgehead on the eastern side of the river at the Battle of Ramnagar. Although they subsequently withdrew from their exposed bridgehead, the Sikhs captured a British gun and inflicted heavy losses. They regarded the battle as a victory and their morale was raised.

====Battle of Sadulpur====
On 3 December 1848, Gough despatched a cavalry force under Major General Joseph Thackwell to cross the Chenab upstream of Ramnagar and turn the Sikh left, but Thackwell then paused to await infantry reinforcements, allowing the Sikhs to withdraw without interference. Gough claimed this indecisive action as a victory.

====Battle of Chillianwala====

At the start of 1849, Amir Dost Mohammed Khan of Afghanistan sided with the rebellious Sikhs, who agreed to cede the city of Peshawar and its surrounding area which had been conquered by Ranjit Singh early in the nineteenth century. Dost Mohammed Khan&#x27;s support of the Sikhs was cautious, but when 3,500 Afghan horsemen approached the vital fort of Attock on the Indus River, its garrison of Muslim troops installed earlier by Nicholson defected. This allowed Chattar Singh to move out of Hazara and march west and then south, intending to link up with Sher Singh&#x27;s army. Dalhousie had earlier ordered Gough to halt operations while waiting for Multan to fall, which would allow Whish to reinforce him. Learning of the fall of Attock, he instead ordered Gough to destroy Sher Singh&#x27;s army before Chattar Singh could join him.

Gough unexpectedly encountered Sher Singh&#x27;s position near the Jhelum River on 13 January 1849. Sher Singh had cunningly concealed his army, and Gough was faced with the choice of withdrawing, or attacking when it was late in the day. Gough unhesitatingly took the latter course. The resulting Battle of Chillianwala was desperately fought. Gough&#x27;s troops, attacking into thick scrub without effective artillery support, suffered heavy losses. Some units lost their colours (which was regarded as a disgrace) and part of one British cavalry regiment fled in panic, resulting in the loss of four guns, also reckoned a humiliation. Sher Singh&#x27;s army was also hard hit, losing twelve of its own guns.

Three days of heavy rain followed, discouraging both sides from renewing battle. After both armies had faced each other for three days without renewing the action, both withdrew. Sher Singh continued northwards to join Chattar Singh, which made the battle into a strategic British defeat. Gough nevertheless claimed a victory, which Dalhousie scornfully dubbed as &quot;perhaps poetical.&quot;

There was much alarm at the losses Gough had suffered. His tactics were severely criticised. Military experts in Britain described him as a &quot;superannuated general who could not mount his horse without assistance&quot; and he was replaced by General Charles James Napier, who would require several weeks to arrive from England. Some junior officers reckoned that the true cause of the setback lay lower down the ranks. Promotion in both the British and Bengal armies came slowly, and by the time officers were appointed to command regiments and brigades, they were too old, and worn out by harsh climate and disease. At Chillianwala, several senior officers had proved unable to command their units effectively.

====Battle of Dullah==== 
In the aftermath of Chillianwala, Sher Singh Attariwalla sent a force of 100 cavalries along with 500 infantry of the Sikh Regiment and fought another battle with British on 16th January 1849 at Heights of Dullah, the Sikh chiefs supported Ram Singh Pathania and his Rajput men. In return, the British sent a huge force under the command of Brigadier Wheeler.

====Battle of Gujrat====
Meanwhile, Whish&#x27;s force completed their siege works around Multan, their batteries opened fire and made a breach in the defences, which the infantry stormed. Mulraj surrendered on 22 January. The ending of the siege allowed Whish to reinforce Gough. In particular, Whish&#x27;s division had large numbers of heavy guns, which the Sikhs lacked.

As Gough&#x27;s army closed in on the Sikh Army, he sent William Hodson to scout the Sikh Army&#x27;s position. Sher Singh attempted a last outflanking move, sending cavalry to cross the Chenab, and re-cross in Gough&#x27;s rear. They were thwarted by heavy rains which made the river difficult to cross, and by British irregular cavalry led by Harry Burnett Lumsden. On 21 February, Gough attacked the Sikh Army at the Battle of Gujrat. Here, he began the battle with a three-hour bombardment from almost 100 guns, which drove the Sikhs from their hasty entrenchments. He then sent his cavalry, led by Sir Joseph Thackwell, and horse artillery after them in a pursuit which lasted for four hours. The Sikhs began gradually retreating into rougher territory filled with Muslim villagers who mainly supported the British against the Sikhs. The Sikh loss was estimated at between 3,000 and 5,000 men and 53 guns; the British casualties were 96 killed and 700 wounded.

On 12 March, Chattar Singh and Sher Singh surrendered to Sir Walter Gilbert near Rawalpindi. Some 20,000 men (mainly irregular cavalry) laid down their arms. The Afghan contingent hastily withdrew through Attock and Peshawar, which the British reoccupied. Dost Mohammad Khan later signed a treaty acknowledging British possession of these cities. The British had also gained control of the Khyber Pass which became the westernmost boundary of the British Raj. British rule was largely welcomed by the local Muslim population which had detested the rule of the Sikh Empire. This was also due to the fact that the British reallowed the Muslim call of prayer to go on which had been banned by the Sikhs and the British also reconstructed many mosques which had been desecrated and left under decay by Sikh rule.

== War photography ==

John McCosh, a surgeon in the Bengal Army, is considered by some historians to be the first war photographer known by name. He produced a series of photographs documenting the Second Anglo-Sikh War. These consisted of portraits of fellow officers, key figures from the campaigns, administrators and their wives and daughters, including Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew, Generals Gough and Napier, and Dewan Mulraj of Multan. He also photographed local people and architecture, artillery emplacements and the destructive aftermath.

==Aftermath==

Lord Dalhousie proclaimed Britain&#x27;s annexation of the Punjab on April 2nd, 1849. His foreign secretary, Henry Meirs Elliot, arrived at Lahore to obtain the signatures of the members of the Council of Regency and Duleep Singh. A durbar was held in the Lahore Fort where Singh affixed his signatures to the document which confirmed the annexation. The Sikh defeat had several causes. Their administration of the population of the Punjab had been poor, which meant that their large armies found it difficult to find enough food while the East India Company had brought overwhelming force against them.

The Anglo-Sikh wars gave the two sides a mutual respect for each other&#x27;s fighting prowess (although the war itself had been unchivalrously fought; the Sikhs took no prisoners at Chillianwala, and the British had taken no prisoners at Gujrat). There was an increased recruitment of people from various communities of the Punjab in the Punjab Irregular Force under British command. These recruits fought for the East India Company during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, against the mutineers and other opponents (mostly high-caste Hindus from Eastern provinces, and forces or loyalists of Shia, Maratha and Mughal rulers). These Punjabi recruits had especially little sympathy with the Hindu mutineers of the Bengal Army, ironically contributed to by the latter&#x27;s role in helping the British in the Anglo-Sikh wars. A long history of enmity of the Sikhs with Mughal rule did not help the mutineers&#x27; cause either, given their choice of Bahadur Shah Zafar as a symbolic leader.

==Battle honour==
The battle honour &quot;Punjaub&quot; was distributed with a free hand to all regiments employed in the operations of the Anglo-Sikh Wars during 1848–49 vide Gazette of the Governor General 277 of 1849, and the list of regiments honoured was issued vide. GoGG 803 of 1853. The Bombay Army was awarded separately and the spelling was changed from &#x27;Punjaub&#x27; to &#x27;Punjab&#x27; vide &quot;Gazette of India&quot; No. 1079 of 1910. Forty of the honoured units of the Bengal Army were consumed by the Mutiny. India has now raised a memorial at Ferozepore to pay homage to men of the Sikh Khalsa Army who laid down their lives in the Anglo-Sikh Wars and the battle honour is considered to be repugnant.

<text>Yaropolk II Vladimirovich (1082 – 18 February 1139) was Prince of Pereyaslavl (1114–1132) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1132–1139). He was a son of Vladimir II Monomakh and Gytha of Wessex. He fought in several campaigns against the Cumans, once in 1103 and again in 1116.

==Reign==
After the death of his brother in 1132, Mstislav I the Great, Yaropolk received the crown of Kiev. Yaropolk had to deal with the many interests of his family, most of all his powerful half brother Yuri Dolgoruki. Yaropolk appointed Vsevolod Mstislavich to succeed him in Pereyaslavl but Yuri Dolgoruki, with the consent of the Novgorodians, soon drove out his nephew. Yaropolk appointed another son of Mstislav I: Iziaslav Mstislavich to Pereyaslavl, who also received Turov. He was replaced soon thereafter by Yaropolk&#x27;s brother Viacheslav Vladimirovich.

The peace did not last long and in 1134 the merry-go-round started once more. Iziaslav had to transfer Turov to his uncle Viacheslav to let him rule the principality once again. Pereyaslavl would come to Yuri Dolgoruki on the condition that Iziaslav got to rule Rostov although Yuri kept a large part of the principality under his influence. Iziaslav also got to rule Volyn and another half brother of Yaropolk, Andrey Vladimirovich was to rule Pereyaslavl.

Vsevolod Olgovich, then the prince of Chernigov, the Cumans and his allies who were asked by Iziaslav to make his point against Viacheslav, continued their war against Yaropolk and crossed the Dnieper to loot the Kiev region. After a decisive battle at the river Supoy in 1135, Yaropolk had to cede the town of Kursk only gained 17 years earlier.

Due to this change of balance the people of Novgorod expelled Vsevolod Mstislavich from Novgorod and replaced him with the brother of the Chernigov prince, Sviatoslav Olgovich. Vsevolod moved to Pskov and died in 1138 at the siege of Novgorod. Who were convinced to replace Sviatoslav with Rostislav Yuryevich, the eldest son of Yuri Dolgoruki.

Sviatoslav continued the war against Yaropolk with also this time, Yaropolk&#x27;s old enemies, the Cumans on his side. He found soon the combined troops of Kiev, Pereyaslavl, Rostov, Polotsk, Smolensk, parts of Halych and 30,000 Hungarians, sent by the king Bela II before the gates of Chernigov. He was forced to make peace in 1139.

Just before his death Yaropolk assisted Bela II when he was faced with internal enemies.

He died in 1139, and was buried in the church of St. Andrey. His brother, Viacheslav I, who succeeded him was soon driven out by Vsevolod II.

==Marriage and children==
Married in 1116 to Helena, an Ossetian princess.

<doc id="935950" wikidata="Q2889403" url="?curid=935950" title="Lambada (film)">
<text>Lambada is a 1990 drama film starring J. Eddie Peck, Melora Hardin, Adolfo &quot;Shabba-doo&quot; Quiñones, Ricky Paull Goldin, Dennis Burkley, and Keene Curtis. Lambada was written and directed by Joel Silberg and choreographed by Shabba-Doo.

The film was released simultaneously with rival film &quot;The Forbidden Dance&quot;; neither was well received, though &quot;Lambada&quot; was seen as &#x27;the better of the two&#x27;.

==Plot==
A Beverly Hills school teacher by day, Kevin Laird (J. Eddie Peck) journeys at night to a warehouse in East Los Angeles, California, where a group of barrio kids gather to dance the lambada.

Using his dazzling dance moves to earn the kids&#x27; respect and acceptance, Kevin then teaches them academics in an informal backroom study hall. One of his students, Sandy (Melora Hardin) sees him at the club. The next morning at school while Kevin is teaching, Sandy daydreams that she and Kevin are dancing and he madly kisses her on his motorcycle. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, but when Sandy becomes a jealous and lovestruck student and she exposes Kevin&#x27;s double life, his two worlds collide, threatening his job and reputation.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Lambada&quot; opened on March 16, 1990 at #8, and earned $2,031,181 to 1117 theaters. It quickly fell from the box office with a scant $4,263,112, after receiving mixed reviews. It holds a 47% on Rotten Tomatoes. Kevin Thomas, in his review (of this film and &quot;The Forbidden Dance&quot;) for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, noted that both of them &#x27;revive the spirit of Sam Katzman, who turned out similar quickies in the ‘50s to cash in on rock ‘n’ roll and the Twist&#x27;; he singled out &quot;Lambada&quot; as the &#x27;slicker but more impersonally directed&#x27; of the two. The two films also shared a review from Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who described &quot;Lambada&quot; as the &#x27;glossier [and more] music-video-ready&#x27; of the two. Owen Gleiberman paired the two films again in his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, where he described them as having &#x27;all the allure of a frozen burrito&#x27;. In yet another paired review of both films for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley dismissed them as &#x27;pandering and exploitative&#x27;; she described &quot;Lambada&quot; as being &#x27;far lighter on its feet with a flashier look and a professional cast&#x27;.

On their syndicated television program, where &quot;Lambada&quot; was reviewed separately, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert had an intense disagreement regarding the film. While noting Silberg&#x27;s limitations as a director, Siskel praised the performances of the lead performers, and described it as &#x27;an instant guilty pleasure [...] a film I&#x27;m almost embarrassed to admit held my attention [...] because I&#x27;m prepared to defend it now against Roger&#x27;s sure attacks&#x27;. Ebert, who remarked that Siskel &#x27;should be embarrassed&#x27; by his opinion of the film, viewed its dance sequences as &#x27;badly lit, badly photographed, badly choreographed&#x27; and attacked the camera angles and story-line; he noted that he was &#x27;stunned that anyone would make this picture&#x27;.

==Home video==
&quot;Lambada&quot; was released on DVD on Apr 15, 2003.

<text>Vsevolod II Olgovich (died August 1, 1146) was Prince of Chernigov (1127–1139) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1139–1146). He was a son of Oleg Svyatoslavich, Prince of Chernigov.

==Family==
Vsevolod married Maria Mstislavna of Kiev, the daughter of Grand Duke Mstislav of Kiev. They had two sons and two daughters:
# Sviatoslav III of Kiev
# Yaroslav II Vsevolodovich, born in 1139
# Anna of Chernigov, married a prince of Halych, son of Vasylko Rostyslavych according to some chronicles
# Zvenislava of Chernigov, married Boleslaw I the Tall, Duke of Wroclaw

Though he had two sons, Vsevolod&#x27;s chosen successor was his brother, Igor, and he obtained pledges from his subjects to accept Igor as his heir. According to one account, Vsevolod even had the Kievans kiss the Holy Cross and swear loyalty to Igor, which they resented. Shortly before his death, Vsevolod became a monk under the name Gavriil.

<doc id="935960" wikidata="Q7179541" url="?curid=935960" title="Pewabic Pottery">
<text>Pewabic Pottery is a ceramic studio and school in Detroit, Michigan. Founded in 1903, the studio is known for its iridescent glazes, some of which grace notable buildings such as the Shedd Aquarium and Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. The pottery continues in operation today, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991.

==Origin and history==
The pottery was founded in 1903 by the artist and teacher Mary Chase Perry Stratton and her business partner Horace James Caulkins. Caulkins was considered a high-heat and kiln specialist and developed the &quot;Revelation kiln&quot;. Mary Chase Perry Stratton was &quot;the artistic and marketing force.&quot; The collaboration of the two and their blend of art and technology gave the pottery its distinctive qualities as Detroit&#x27;s contribution to the International Arts and Crafts movement and exemplified the American Craftsman Style.

The word Pewabic is derived from the Ojibwa (or Chippewa) word &quot;wabic&quot;, which means metal, or &quot;bewabic&quot;, which means iron or steel. Stratton&#x27;s father had worked as a doctor for the Pewabic copper mine in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula when she was a girl. The company is well known for the unusual iridescent glaze covering the pottery and tiles created in a manner outlined by the International Arts and Crafts movement.

In 1991, Pewabic Pottery was designated as a National Historic Landmark (see also List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan). As Michigan&#x27;s only historic pottery, the center continues to operate in a 1907 Tudor Revival building as a non-profit educational institution. They offer classes in ceramics, hold exhibitions, sell pottery made in house, showcase and sell artists from across the United States, and offer design and fabrication services for public and private buildings.

==Museum and galleries==
The museum&#x27;s exhibits focus on the company&#x27;s role in the history of Detroit, the Arts and Crafts movement in America and the development of ceramic art in the country. The galleries also showcase new works by modern ceramic artists.

==Famous works==
Pewabic Pottery produces many kinds of hand made decorative objects. They are part of the collections of the Detroit Institute of Arts, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, and the Freer Gallery of Art. 

Under Mary Stratton&#x27;s artistic leadership, Pewabic Pottery employees created lamps, vessels, and architectural tiles. Architectural pieces have been a staple in Pewabic&#x27;s history. They were known for their iridescent glazes. Architectural tiles were used in churches, concert halls, fountains, libraries, museums, schools and public buildings. The studio&#x27;s work graces numerous edifices throughout Michigan and the rest of the United States. Noteworthy examples include Herzstein Hall at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois. Detailed maps of public installations in the Detroit Metropolitan Area and the U.S.A. are available. &quot;See&quot; &quot;Architectural tile&quot; &quot;infra&quot;.

Particularly notable was the company&#x27;s work at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., consisting of arches outlined with iridescent Pewabic tile, huge ceramic medallions set in the ceiling, and fourteen Stations of the Cross for the crypt.

Pewabic&#x27;s design team continues to create ornate tile conceptions for public and private buildings. Contemporary installations include Comerica Park, home of the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Medical Center Children&#x27;s Hospital, five Detroit People Mover stations, Third Man Records (Detroit), stations for the Q-Line, and the Herald Square in New York City.

<text>Tombac, or tombak, is a brass alloy with high copper content and 5–20% zinc content. Tin, lead or arsenic may be added for colouration.
It is a cheap malleable alloy mainly used for medals, ornament, decoration and some munitions.
In older use, the term may apply to brass alloy with a zinc content as high as 28–35%.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;tombak&quot; is derived from &quot;tembaga&quot;, an Indonesian/Malay word of Javanese origin meaning &#x27;copper&#x27;. &quot;Tembaga&quot; entered Dutch usage concurrent with their colonisation of Indonesia. Likely, the term was used generically to describe Indonesian high-copper brass items, including gamelan gongs. It is one of the very few Indonesian loan words used in English or German.

==Common types==
* Modern CuZn15 (DIN: CuZn15 ; UNS: C23000 ; BS: CW 502L (CZ 102) ; ISO: CuZn15) – tombak with a gold colour, very good for cold forming, suitable for pressing, hammering, or embossing
* modern CuZn12 (not standardized) – same characteristics and applications as CuZn15, slightly different colour
* modern CuZn10 (DIN: CuZn10; UNS: C22000; BS: CW 501L (CZ 101); ISO: CuZn10) – similar characteristics and applications as CuZn15 and CuZn12, noticeable reddish colour
* modern white tombac – CuZn10 that is zinc content 10%, with trace arsenic
* modern enamel tombac or &quot;emailler tombak&quot; – an alloy of 95% copper and 5% zinc, suitable for enamelling, therefore the name.

Ure notes the following forms of &quot;tombak&quot; in widespread use during the time the text was published (1856):
*&quot;Gilting tombac&quot;:
**Copper 82%, zinc 18%, lead 1.5%, tin 3%
**Copper 82%, zinc 18%, lead 3%, tin 1%
**Copper 82%, zinc 18%, lead, tin 0.2%
*&quot;French tombac for sword handles&quot;, pommels and fittings: copper 80%, zinc 17%, 3% tin
*&quot;Yellow tombac of Paris&quot; for gilt ornaments: copper 85%, zinc 15%, trace% tin
*&quot;Hanover tombac&quot;: copper 85.3%, zinc 14.7%
*Chrysochalk: copper 86%, zinc 14%
*&quot;Red tombac of Paris&quot;: copper 90%, zinc 7.9%, 1.5% lead
*&quot;Red tombac of Vienna&quot;: copper 97.8%, zinc 2.2%

Piggot states the brass used for machinery and locomotives in England was composed of copper 74.5%, zinc 25%, and lead 0.5%, which would make it a tombac according to Ure.
Piggot&#x27;s own definition of tombak is problematic at best: &quot;red brass, or tombak, as it is called by some, has a great preponderance of copper, from 5 ounces of zinc down to 1/4 ounce of zinc to the pound [of copper].&quot;

===Tempers===
Typical tempers are soft annealed and rolled hard.

==Applications==
Tombac is soft and easy to work by hand: hand tools can easily punch, cut, enamel, repousse, engrave, gild, or etch it. It has a higher than most brasses or copper, and does not easily tarnish.
Historically, it was used by the Javanese as a &quot;faux&quot; gold finish for &quot;objects d&#x27;art&quot; and ornaments. 
* Most commonly, tombac in modern society is used in medals and awards of lesser importance, such as the German Oldenburg Long-Service Medallion for their Gendarmerie.
*The &quot;Pickelhaube&quot; and &quot;cuirass&quot; of the Imperial German and Prussian Army were at one time made of tombac.
* German, particularly Prussian, field uniforms (which were also sold to equip the White Russians), had buttons and decorative fittings made of tombac.
* Currently, tombac foils are used in arts and crafts for decorative articles, especially as an economic alternative to very expensive gold leaf.
* Industry uses tombac foil for heating foils and etch applications.
* Gilding metal is a type of tombac which is one of the most common jacketing materials for full metal and hollow-point jacketed bullets.
* The 1980 Olympic &#x27;Bronze&#x27; medals were actually tombac.
* During World War II, Canada minted 5-cent pieces (nickels) in tombac in 1942 and 1943.
* The German military used it for some combat medals during World War II.
* The Swedish armed forces adopted a special-service round for the Carl Gustav m/45 submachine gun with a tombac-plated steel jacket surrounding the lead core of the bullet loaded in the cartridge. While the lands of the barrel can cut into the tombac, the steel jacket resists deformation and thus causes the gas pressure to rise higher than the previous soft-jacketed m/39, giving the 6,8-g (106-grain) bullet a muzzle velocity of .
* Brass alloys, including tombak, are occasionally used in architecture, such as ornaments, roofs or outside wall plating. It withstands corrosion well.

<doc id="935969" wikidata="Q2509270" url="?curid=935969" title="The Brighter Day">
<text>The Brighter Day is an American daytime soap opera which aired on CBS from January 4, 1954, to September 28, 1962. Originally created for NBC Radio by Irna Phillips in 1948, the radio and television versions ran simultaneously from 1954–56. Set in New Hope, Wisconsin, the series revolved around Reverend Richard Dennis and his four children, Althea, Patsy, Babby and Grayling.

&quot;The Brighter Day&quot; was the first soap opera to air on network television with an explicitly religious theme. Another soap opera created by Phillips, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, initially had a religious theme as a radio show but dropped it by the time the series moved to television.

==History==
&quot;The Brighter Day&quot; had its roots in the radio soap opera &quot;Joyce Jordan, M.D.&quot; Dr. Jordan lived near the Dennis family&#x27;s hometown of Three Rivers, and listeners of the Jordan program became acquainted with the Dennises in 1948. According to Jim Cox in &quot;The Great Radio Soap Operas&quot;, &quot;By the time Dr. Jordan said &#x27;good-by&#x27; on her final broadcast on Friday, October 8, 1948, the fans were already acquainted with the family that would replace her. The following Monday listeners could easily connect with the new series growing out of the show they had been hearing for so long.&quot; Smoothing the transition even more, &quot;The Brighter Day&quot;&#x27;s announcer, sponsor, network and time slot were the same as those of &quot;Joyce Jordan, M.D.&quot;

The original radio version took place in the town of Three Rivers, but in late 1953 the Dennis family was forced to move to New Hope as a result of a flood washing out Three Rivers. Later in the run, the Dennis family moved to Columbus, established as a college town. There were five children in the radio version, but the oldest daughter, Liz (played from 1949–1954 by actress Margaret Draper), married and left the family as the show began on television. Also living with Reverend Dennis was his widowed sister, Emily Potter.

&quot;The Brighter Day&quot; had mid-range Nielsen ratings for most of its run. During the 1950s, it was in the middle of the pack typically landing between 5th and 7th place over all and in the middle of all the CBS soaps. The show&#x27;s best season was 1955–1956, when it did not have any competition from ABC and weak offerings from NBC.

With the premiere of &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in 1957 and &quot;Bandstand&quot;&#x27;s surge in popularity a year later, the CBS strip of &quot;The Verdict is Yours&quot; at 3:30, &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; at 4:00, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; at 4:15 and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; at 4:30 all took a hit of about one rating point. Though The Secret Storm&quot; and The Edge of Night&quot; rebounded, &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; and its lead-in &quot;The Verdict Is Yours&quot; did not. By the 1960–61 season, both shows were holding their own, but had still taken a ratings hit.

In Summer 1961, Procter &amp; Gamble gave up production of the show to CBS and moved production of the series from New York City to Los Angeles in an effort to save money. Key characters and stories were dropped when their actors did not wish to relocate. In the Summer of 1962, with &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; proving formidable against &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, CBS decided to expand &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, creating a powerful hour-long soap block to counterprogram against &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. This decision had both &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; and &quot;The Verdict is Yours&quot; moving from their mid/late afternoon slots to mid/late morning. The timeslot change was the final nail in the coffin, as both series lost almost half their audience, with &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; falling from a 6.9 to 3.7. Mid-late morning had never been successful for serials, and this instance was no different.

In August 1962, the show made history by creating the first daytime television contract role for an African American actor. The actor, Rex Ingram, appeared as an ordained minister named Victor Graham beginning on September 17, but didn&#x27;t have time to make much of an impact, as the show was cancelled two weeks later on September 28.

The network announced that the show would be cancelled with less than two weeks before the final episode aired. In the final episode, actor Paul Langton addressed the viewers in character as Uncle Walter, wrapping up the storylines and explaining how the characters would resolve their problems. Langton ended the show with a final farewell: &quot;The microphone can&#x27;t pick up their voices and soon the picture will fade. If on occasion you think of us, we hope your memory will be a pleasant one.&quot;

Among the show&#x27;s writers were Doris Frankle and Sam Hall. Towards the end of the series, Agnes Nixon was hired to write the show (and had created the character on which Ada and Rachel Davis, two characters on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot;, were based), but the show was cancelled before her work was ever taped. Nixon went on to write &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; and, later, &quot;Another World&quot;, before creating her two classic soap operas on the ABC network, &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

Among the actors who appeared on the series, the most famous alumni are Hal Holbrook (Grayling Dennis), Lois Nettleton (Patsy Dennis Hamilton), and Patty Duke (Ellen Williams Dennis).

<text>The tesla (symbol: T) is the unit of magnetic flux density (also called magnetic B-field strength) in the International System of Units (SI). 

One tesla is equal to one weber per square metre. The unit was announced during the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 and is named in honour of Serbian-American electrical and mechanical engineer Nikola Tesla, upon the proposal of the Slovenian electrical engineer France Avčin.

== Definition ==
A particle, carrying a charge of one coulomb (C), and moving perpendicularly through a magnetic field of one tesla, at a speed of one metre per second (m/s), experiences a force with magnitude one newton (N), according to the Lorentz force law. That is, 
formula_1

As an SI derived unit, the tesla can also be expressed in terms of other units. For example, a magnetic flux of 1 weber (Wb) through a surface of one square meter is equal to a magnetic flux density of 1 tesla. That is,
formula_2

Expressed only in SI base units, 1 tesla is:
formula_3
where A is ampere, kg is kilogram, and s is second.
Additional equivalences result from the derivation of coulombs from amperes (A), formula_4:

the relationship between newtons and joules (J), formula_6:

and the derivation of the weber from volts (V), formula_8:

== Electric vs. magnetic field ==

In the production of the Lorentz force, the difference between electric fields and magnetic fields is that a force from a magnetic field on a charged particle is generally due to the charged particle&#x27;s movement, while the force imparted by an electric field on a charged particle is not due to the charged particle&#x27;s movement. This may be appreciated by looking at the units for each. The unit of electric field in the MKS system of units is newtons per coulomb, N/C, while the magnetic field (in teslas) can be written as N/(C⋅m/s). The dividing factor between the two types of field is metres per second (m/s), which is velocity. This relationship immediately highlights the fact that whether a static electromagnetic field is seen as purely magnetic, or purely electric, or some combination of these, is dependent upon one&#x27;s reference frame (that is, one&#x27;s velocity relative to the field).

In ferromagnets, the movement creating the magnetic field is the electron spin (and to a lesser extent electron orbital angular momentum). In a current-carrying wire (electromagnets) the movement is due to electrons moving through the wire (whether the wire is straight or circular).

== Conversion to non-SI units ==
One tesla is equivalent to:
For the relation to the units of the magnetising field (ampere per metre or oersted), see the article on permeability.

== Multiples ==

<text>Iziaslav II Mstislavich ( – 13 November 1154) was Grand Prince of Kiev (1146–1154). He was also Prince of Pereyaslavl (1132; 1143–1145), Prince of Turov (1132–1134), Prince of Rostov (1134–), and Prince of Volhynia (1134–1142). He is the founder of the &quot;Iziaslavichi&quot; branch of Rurikid princes in Volhynia.

== Family ==
The second son of the Kievan prince Mstislav I and Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden, grandson of Vladimir II Monomakh. He was baptized as Panteleimon. The progenitor of the Izyaslavych dynasty of Volhynia and Galicia (senior branch). Great-grandfather of Daniel of Galicia.

The identity of his first wife, is a daughter of Conrad III of Germany and his first wife Gertrude of Comburg, her name was possibly &quot;Agnes&quot;. She died in 1151. Their children were:
# Mstislav II of Kiev
# Yaroslav II of Kiev
# Yaropolk, Prince of Shumsk
## Vasylko (1151–1182), prince of Shumsk
# Evdokia, married Mieszko III the Old, High Duke of Poland.
# daughter, in 1143 married Rogvold Rogvoldovich of Drutsk.

Iziaslav&#x27;s second wife was Bagrationi daughter of King Demetrius I of Georgia, but they were married for only a few months in 1154 before his death. After the death of her husband, she returned to Georgia.

==Legacy==
On August 24, 2022, the 8th Separate Special Purpose Regiment (Ukraine) was given his honourary name.

<doc id="935991" wikidata="Q4045635" url="?curid=935991" title="Descender">
<text>In typography and handwriting, a descender is the portion of a grapheme that extends below the baseline of a font.

For example, in the letter &quot;y&quot;, the descender is the &quot;tail&quot;, or that portion of the diagonal line which lies below the &quot;v&quot; created by the two lines converging. In the letter &quot;p&quot;, it is the stem reaching down past the &quot;ɒ&quot;.

In most fonts, descenders are reserved for lowercase characters such as &quot;g&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and sometimes &quot;f&quot;. Some fonts, however, also use descenders for some numerals (typically &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, and &quot;9&quot;). Such numerals are called old-style numerals. (Some italic fonts, such as Computer Modern italic, put a descender on the numeral &quot;4&quot; but not on any other numerals. Such fonts are not considered old-style.) Some fonts also use descenders for the tails on a few uppercase letters such as &quot;J&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;.

The parts of characters that extend above the x-height of a font are called ascenders.

Descenders are often reduced in small-print typefaces for uses such as newspapers, directories or pocket Bibles to fit more text on a page. More radically, on 20 May 1802 Philip Rusher of Banbury patented a new Patent Type with eliminated descenders and shortened ascenders. The type did not prove successful, nor did another use in 1852. The Art Nouveau display typeface Hobo and headline typeface Permanent Headline which also eliminate descenders have both been somewhat popular since.

Some early computer displays (for example, the Compukit UK101) and printers (for example, the Commodore 4022) restricted the vertical spacing of characters so that there was no space for correct display of descenders. Instead, characters with descenders were displaced vertically upwards so that the bottom of the descender was aligned with the baseline. Contemporary systems that did not have this restriction were described as supporting &quot;true descenders&quot;.

== Analogues in Thai script ==

Some type designers have observed the “tails” of some Thai glyphs to be analogues to the descenders. (e.g. ) Other authors have also mentioned pedestals/feet to be analogues to the descenders. (e.g. , , and )

<doc id="935994" wikidata="Q3814580" url="?curid=935994" title="Kenneth Cole (designer)">
<text>Kenneth D. Cole (born March 23, 1954) is an American designer, social activist, business owner, and philanthropist. His global company, Kenneth Cole Productions, creates clothing and other products under the labels Kenneth Cole New York, Reaction Kenneth Cole, and Unlisted, as well as footwear under the label Gentle Souls.

== Early life and education ==
Born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, his father, Charles Cole, owned the El Greco shoe manufacturing company. Cole graduated from John L. Miller Great Neck North High School in 1972. Before learning the family business and starting his own company in 1982, Cole graduated from Emory College of Arts and Sciences of Emory University in 1976. 

== Birth of a shoe company ==
Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. is an American fashion house founded in 1982 by Kenneth Cole. Wanting to preview his line of shoes at the New York Shoe Expo at the New York Hilton, but unable to afford the purchase of a hotel room or showroom to display his items, Cole inquired about parking a trailer two blocks from the Hilton Hotel. Upon discovering that permits for trailers were only granted to utility and production companies, Cole changed the name of his company from Kenneth Cole Incorporated to Kenneth Cole Productions, and applied for a permit to film the full-length film, &quot;The Birth of a Shoe Company&quot;. In two and a half days, Kenneth Cole Productions sold 40,000 pairs of shoes, while chronicling the beginning of the company on film.

In 1994, Kenneth Cole went public, and has been included on &quot;Forbes&quot; annual list of 200 Best Small Companies four times.

Kenneth Cole Productions sells clothing and accessories under the following labels: Kenneth Cole New York, Kenneth Cole Reaction, Unlisted and Gentle Souls. The company’s products are also distributed through department stores, specialty stores, company-owned retail stores, and its e-commerce website and digital global flagship, www.kennethcole.com.

The company has a wide variety of strategic partnerships for the production of men’s apparel, fragrances, watches, jewelry, eye-wear, and several other categories.

Kenneth Cole and the company have expressed a commitment to helping communities in need by supporting public health, civil liberties, and sustainability.

== Support of progressive social causes ==
Since 1985, Kenneth Cole has been openly involved in publicly supporting AIDS awareness and research. He is considered the first in the fashion industry to do so. He uses fashion as a medium to promote socially conscious ads to help fight various issues, from AIDS to homelessness. He has donated proceeds to such organizations as Mentoring USA, amfAR and Rock the Vote. Since 2005, Cole has served as chairman for amfAR. In November 2017, sixty people including prominent AIDS activists signed a demand that Cole step down from his position after a federal investigation for fraud and money laundering was opened. In February 2018, Cole stepped down as Chairman after serving more than 30 years on amfAR&#x27;s board and 14 years as Chairman, amid the controversial Harvey Weinstein deal.

In 2001, The Kenneth Cole Foundation, in association with Cole&#x27;s alma mater, Emory University, created The Kenneth Cole Fellows in Community Building and Social Change Program at Emory University.

Cole&#x27;s socially conscious advertising for the causes that he champions has created controversies. One such example was his campaign for World AIDS Day in 2005. He designed T-shirts for the campaign which were sold at such stores as Barneys New York, Scoop, and Louis Boston. The messages on the shirts stated either, &quot;We All Have AIDS&quot; or &quot;I Have AIDS.&quot; Cole created the shirts in hopes that those with or without AIDS would wear the shirts, to help diminish the stigma attached to the disease. Cole stated, &quot;There is a legend of the Danish king, Christian X, who, during World War II, when Hitler insisted all Jews publicly wear a yellow Star of David, would wear the star himself, hence making it difficult to differentiate who was Jewish. This is kind of like that, hopefully.&quot;

In August 2006, it was announced that Kenneth Cole Productions would stop selling fur in all of their garments for the Fall 2007 Fashion Season.

In October 2007, Cole guest-starred in the &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; episode &quot;Betty&#x27;s Wait Problem&quot;.

In the summer of 2007, Kenneth Cole Productions also began their &quot;Awearness&quot; Campaign, which will produce a line of T-shirts to benefit the charities that the company supports, and proceeds will go to the Awearness Fund. The campaign is further promoted by a book &quot;Awearness: Inspiring Stories About How to Make a Difference&quot; featuring celebrities assisting various causes.

On May 1, 2009, Cole delivered Northeastern University&#x27;s keynote address at the Commencement ceremony.

In July 2023, Cole co-hosted an event entitled &quot;We the Future&quot; alongside Deepak Chopra. It explored the future of AI, and supported guiding AI from the outset to create positive disruption and to on a worldwide basis establish peace as the cornerstone of innovation. It featured as speakers real estate investor Craig Hatkoff on AI&#x27;s application to innovation, disability rights activist Eddie Ndopu on AI and accessibility, astronaut Sian Proctor on AI and space, record producer Jerry Wonda  on AI and music, and model and actress Gabriella Wright on AI and well-being.

==Awards==

In 1998, &quot;People Magazine&quot; voted Cole as &quot;Sexiest Businessman of the Year.&quot;

On May 14, 2009, The Legal Aid Society of New York City honored Kenneth Cole with its inaugural Theodore Roosevelt Corporate Award at the Waldorf Astoria during its Servant of Justice Award Dinner. Proceeds went to benefit struggling New Yorkers who live in poverty.

In November 2011, Cole was honored by the Ride of Fame and a double-decker tour bus was dedicated to him in New York City.

In 2016, Cole received the UNAIDS International Goodwill Ambassador award.

In 2017, Cole received the CFDA Swarovski Award for Positive Change.

In 2011 and 2019, Footwear News named Cole Icon for Social Impact.

In 2020, Cole received Person of the Year Award from the American Apparel and Footwear Association as well as the Visionary Change Maker Award from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Child Mind.

In 2022, Cole received the Suicide Prevention Champion Award from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Child Mind.

==Controversies==
On February 3, 2011, Cole posted an update on Twitter that referenced the 2011 Egyptian protests. The tweet, which indicated that Cole himself wrote the entry, said: &quot;Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available online at (website address) -KC&quot;. After outrage and much parody on the microblogging site and on the web in general, Cole deleted the entry and posted a personal apology on Facebook.

In April 2012, the designer sparked controversy portraying the national debate over education as one that pits &quot;Teachers’ Rights vs. Students&#x27; Rights&quot;. On the West Side Highway southbound entering New York City, a billboard punned to southbound commuters, ”Shouldn’t Everyone Be Well Red?” On &quot;Salon&quot;, David Sirota claimed that &quot;Cole&#x27;s campaign is thinly veiled ideological propaganda, and it comes with myriad problems, not the least of which is the simple fact that almost nobody believes &quot;underperforming teachers&quot; should be protected. That includes the nation&#x27;s biggest teachers&#x27; unions, which have been outspoken in backing &quot;accountability&quot; reforms for teacher tenure. So right off the bat, Cole is constructing a straw man, one that has served over the years to pretend that public employee unions in general and teachers&#x27; unions specifically are about nothing more than making sure bad employees get to keep their jobs.&quot; In response to negative outcry, his company announced on Twitter, &quot;We misrepresented the issue—one too complex for a billboard—and are taking it down.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In 1986, Cole met Maria Cuomo, and they married a year later. Maria Cuomo Cole is the daughter of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and sister of former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo and former CNN journalist Chris Cuomo. One of his daughters, Amanda, hosted the Mets Kids Clubhouse for SportsNet New York cable TV network.

Cole and his wife Maria purchased a $14.5 million co-op in 2008 on Sutton Place, Manhattan. At one time, fashion designer Bill Blass lived in this same building. As of 2018, he and his wife reside on an 11.35 acre estate in suburban Purchase, Westchester County, New York. Together, they have three daughters: Emily, Amanda and Catie.

==Plot==
Michael J. &quot;Jay&quot; Cochran is a U.S. Navy aviator, leaving the service after 12 years. He receives a matched pair of Beretta shotguns and an invitation from his wealthy friend, Tiburon &quot;Tibey&quot; Mendez to spend time at his hacienda in Mexico. Tibey is also a powerful crime boss, constantly surrounded by bodyguards.

In Mexico, Cochran meets Tibey&#x27;s beautiful young wife, Miryea, who lives in lavish surroundings, but is unhappy because her much older husband does not want to have any children, feeling pregnancy would spoil her looks.

Jay presents Tibey with a Navy G-1 leather flight jacket. But he rubs Tibey&#x27;s suspicious right-hand man Cesar the wrong way by behaving independently and not acting like an employee. After a dinner, Tibey conducts a private meeting with business associates, killing one of them, while elsewhere Miryea and Jay get better acquainted; they develop a romantic attraction towards each other.

During a party and with Tibey and his men nearby, Jay and Miryea have sex in a closet. Jay tells Miryea he intends to leave Mexico, worried that Tibey will become aware of the situation. Miryea begs Jay to stay and, having fallen in love with her, he agrees and they arrange a secret rendezvous at a remote cabin in Mexico.

Miryea tells Tibey that she will be visiting her sister in Miami, but Tibey overhears a telephone conversation in which Miryea asks her sister to lie for her. Tibey drives Miryea to the airport, giving her one last kiss. Jay is secretly waiting inside the airport, and they drive off to the cabin.

At their hideaway, they are ambushed by Tibey and his men. Jay&#x27;s beloved dog, Rocky, is shot dead. Tibey slashes Miryea across her face with a switchblade (creating half a Glasgow smile) as his henchmen viciously beat Jay into unconsciousness. After setting fire to the cabin, they dump Jay in the desert, leaving him to die.

Tibey takes Miryea to a brothel to be a sex slave. The madame initially rejects her due to her now-disfigured face but agrees to relegate Miryea to &quot;common use&quot;. Under Tibey&#x27;s orders, Miryea is repeatedly drugged, abused, and raped by numerous men on a daily basis. The young man responsible for keeping her drugged has AIDS and as Miryea no longer wishes to live, she persuades him to share a needle with her, therefore, infecting Miryea with HIV.

A critically wounded Jay is discovered by Mauro, a peasant farmer whose family slowly nurses Jay back to health. Jay returns to the burnt cabin and retrieves some money he had hidden. Mauro drives Jay to town and gives him a knife to &quot;cut the balls off your enemy&quot;. Jay encounters a Texan transporting a horse who offers Jay a ride to Durango. Inside a cantina, Jay notices one of the thugs who had thrashed him; he follows him into the men&#x27;s room and cuts his throat.

After a day on the road, the Texan delivers the horse to a wealthy man who recognizes Jay from an afternoon at Tibey&#x27;s estate. The friendly Texan later dies peacefully in his car while Jay is driving.

At a motel, Jay runs across Mauro&#x27;s brother-in-law, Amador. Amador and his quiet friend, Ignacio, are willing to help Jay seek revenge, because Amador&#x27;s sister was killed after getting mixed up in business that involved Tibey. They capture another of Tibey&#x27;s henchmen, who tells them where Miryea can be found. Jay barges into the brothel, only to find that Miryea has been moved. The madam taunts Jay that Miryea proved very popular with the clientele and no one but Tibey knows where she is.

Jay, Amador and Ignacio ambush Tibey and his bodyguard, during Tibey&#x27;s morning horseback ride. Jay is there to ask Miryea&#x27;s whereabouts, but first Tibey requests that Jay ask forgiveness for having stolen his wife. When Jay lowers his gun and asks Tibey&#x27;s forgiveness, Tibey reveals that Miryea is in a convent.

Miryea is in a convent hospice, dying of AIDS. Jay arrives in time to tell Miryea that he loves her. He then carries her outside and Miryea tells Jay that she also loves him, before she dies in his arms, must to Jay&#x27;s complete sadness, as he morns and grieves over the death of the woman that he had loved, Miryea.

==Production==
===Development===
The novella was published in 1979 along with two other novellas under the title &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine published the novella &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; in January 1979 and public response was so enthusiastic that &quot;Revenge&quot; was published in May. Warner Bros promptly bought the screen rights and hired Harrison to do the screenplay.

The project languished in development hell for eleven years. John Huston was to direct Jack Nicholson and then Orson Welles was attached to direct. Harrison later recalled he &quot;wrote about 12 different endings to it&quot;. Walter Hill worked on the screenplay for a while.

Costner had an interest in the novella from the mid-1980s. &quot;It seemed to me something I wanted to do myself&quot;, he said. &quot;I contemplated directing it because it seemed like a small movie. The story was manageable, but the themes were big and universal, and the writing was tough and it was honest and it was original. There was poignance in the story, and it read like an original movie to me.&quot;

Producer Ray Stark eventually acquired the rights from Warner Bros in exchange for the film &quot;Bird&quot;. Costner used his celebrity status to help get the film made.

Costner would serve as executive producer and take a special interest in the script. The writer was Robert Garland who made &quot;No Way Out&quot; with Costner.

For a time it seemed John Huston might direct Costner in the film and the two men met; Huston was not impressed by the actor. In 1987, New World Pictures teamed up with Rastar to co-own feature film rights to the &quot;Revenge&quot; project.

===Shooting===
Principal shooting took place in several Mexican cities, including Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City. Production completed on December 14, 1988. Some shooting took place in Sierra de Órganos National Park in the town of Sombrerete, Mexico. The closing scene was shot at the Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Remedios, one of several monasteries near the volcano Popocatapetl. Director Tony Scott would lend several assets from his prior making of &quot;Top Gun&quot;, including access to the Navy personnel to arrange footage of F-14s over rough desert terrain. Viewers would also recognize the familiar cockpit simulators in &quot;Revenge&quot; opening sequence as those used in &quot;Top Gun&quot;.

==Release==
Columbia released &quot;Revenge&quot; on VHS and Betamax in August 1990. The version included on the 2007 DVD and Blu-ray releases is Tony Scott&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut, shorter by 20 minutes, running 104 minutes, and including expanded scenes as well as some deletions and additional scoring by Harry Gregson-Williams.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 30% based on reviews from 20 critics, with an average rating of 4.4/10. On Metacritic it has a score of 35 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B− on scale of A to F.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;This far-from-perfect rendering of Jim Harrison&#x27;s shimmering novella has a romantic sweep and elemental power that ultimately transcend its flaws.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it D and called it a vanity project for Costner. Roger Ebert, writing for &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, rated it 2.5 out of 4 stars and wrote that the film &quot;plays like a showdown between its style and its story.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;soft and aimless ... the performances are without conviction.&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the story becomes so cynical that nothing has meaning.

&quot;They pretty much shot the novella&quot;, said Harrison. &quot;I was so swept away by it that I cried – I really did. And I&#x27;m not known for crying&quot;. In retrospect, writer Jeffrey Alan Fiskin said: &quot;There are parts of it that I really liked.&quot;

The film grossed $15,535,771 in the United States and Canada and $26.6 million worldwide.

<text>Edythe M. &quot;Delilah&quot; Lewis (February 26, 1924 – June 5, 2014) was an American woman who was the first black, female disc jockey in Dayton, Ohio, United States, in the 1950s.

== Early life and education ==
Lewis was born Edythe Mulzac, raised in Harlem and trained as a nurse at Harlem Hospital in New York. Later, she earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in Education from the University of Cincinnati and then two master&#x27;s degrees.

== Career ==
Lewis was the first black woman to host a radio show in Dayton, Ohio, broadcasting on WING-AM as Delilah in the 1950s. She was inducted into the Dayton Area Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2003. The &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; called her a pioneer and said she was a role model during a period when there were very few black people in the broadcasting industry.

In 1971, she was hired by the Miami Conservancy District. She later became the District&#x27;s executive director. In 1976, Governor James A. Rhodes appointed her to the Ohio Recreation and Resources Commission. In 1979 she was named one of Dayton&#x27;s Top 10 Women by the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;. Lewis retired from the District in the early 1980s.

She served on the boards of Wright State University and the Children&#x27;s Medical Center, among others.

In 2001, her husband Lloyd E. Lewis Jr., a member of the Dayton City Commission, died, and she was elected in a special election to fill out the remaining months of his term, defeating Republican Abner Orick.

== Personal life ==
Lewis died on June 5, 2014, from complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Union violence refers to violence committed by unions or union members to achieve political objectives, particularly during labor disputes. When union violence has occurred, it has frequently been in the context of industrial unrest. Violence has ranged from isolated acts by individuals to wider campaigns of organized violence aimed at furthering union goals within an industrial dispute.

Anti-union violence has also occurred frequently in the context of industrial unrest, and has often involved the collusion of management and government authorities, private agencies, or citizens&#x27; groups in organising violence against unions and their members.

==Overview==
Protests and verbal abuse are routinely aimed against union members or replacement workers who cross picket lines (&quot;blacklegs&quot; or &quot;scabs&quot;) during industrial disputes. The inherent aim of a union is to create a labor monopoly so as to balance the monopsony a large employer enjoys as a purchaser of labor. Strikebreakers threaten that goal and undermine the union&#x27;s bargaining position, and occasionally this erupts into violent confrontation, with violence committed either by, or against, strikers. Some who have sought to explain such violence observe, if labor disputes are accompanied by violence, it may be because labor has no legal redress. In 1894, some workers declared:
...&quot;the right of employers to manage their own business to suit themselves,&quot; is fast coming to mean in effect nothing less than a right to manage the country to suit themselves.

Occasionally, violent disputes occur between unions, when one union breaks another&#x27;s strike.

==Research on union violence==
Researchers in industrial relations, criminology, and wider cultural studies have examined violence by workers or trade unions in the context of industrial disputes. US and Australian government reports have examined violence during industrial disputes.

== By country ==

===Australia===
* 1996 - On 19 August 1996, Australian unionists physically broke into the Australian Parliament and fought Australian Federal Police during the 1996 Parliament House Riot.

=== Spain ===

* 1917-1923 - Pistolerismo

===United Kingdom===
* 1926 - In the context of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, striking miners derailed The Flying Scotsman on May 10.
* 1972 - British Trade Union representative Ricky Tomlinson, now best known as an actor, was convicted for a two-year term for threatening construction workers.
* 1984 - Taxi driver David Wilkie was killed by striking miners while driving a non-striking worker during the NUM UK mining strike of 1984-85.

===United States===
* 1986 - During protests by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1547 against workers replacing union jobs, picketers engaged in scuffles, chanting and sounding gunshots. In 1999, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the union had engaged in &quot;ongoing acts of intimidation, violence, destruction of property&quot;, awarding the plaintiff $212,500 in punitive damages.
* 1990 - on the first day of The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; strike, delivery trucks were attacked with stones and sticks, and in some cases burned, with the drivers beaten. Strikers then started threatening newsstands with arson, or stole all copies of the Daily News and burned them in front of the newsstands. James Hoge, publisher of the &quot;Daily News&quot;, alleged that there had been some 700 serious acts of violence. The New York Police Department claimed knowledge of 229 incidents of violence. Criminal charges under the Hobbs Act were declined, however, citing the aforementioned &quot;Enmons&quot; case.
* 1993 - Eddie York was killed by a rifle shot in the head while crossing a United Mine Workers (UMW) picket line at a coal mine in Logan County, West Virginia, on July 22, 1993. Like the 1990 NY Daily News strike, criminal charges under the Hobbs Act were declined, with the FBI and Justice Department citing the &quot;Enmons&quot; case.
* 1997 - On August 7, 1997, Teamsters Orestes Espinosa, Angel Mielgo, Werner Haechler, Benigno Rojas, and Adrian Paez beat, kicked, and stabbed a UPS worker (Rod Carter) who refused to strike, after Carter received a threatening phone call from the home of Anthony Cannestro Sr., president of Teamsters Local 769.

The series has been exported to Malaysia, Philippines, Australia, Taiwan, France and Canada. It was the first Singaporean show to be broadcast in Australia on SBS and Canada.

It returned briefly during Channel 5&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2003 for Season 7.
The sitcom once again rebroadcast in May 2011 and broadcast on weekdays around 12pm before being dubbed into French.

In September 2011, 30 episodes of Season 1 were dubbed into French and broadcast in other countries worldwide. It became Singapore&#x27;s first-ever English sitcom to be dubbed into a foreign language. Some episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 have been dubbed into French and aired in some other countries in 2011. Season 3 was then dubbed into French in early 2012.

== Singlish ==

This sitcom was notable for its characters&#x27; use of Singlish (an English-based creole with Malay, Chinese, Tamil and other influences) in everyday conversation. Due to its use of Singlish, the show came under pressure by the Singaporean Government to use only &quot;proper&quot; English. This was mainly because of the worry that the younger school going viewers would start speaking Singlish more and bring down the standard of spoken English in Singapore. Another popular Singaporean sitcom that also received similar pressure was &quot;Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd&quot; where the main lead and title character, Phua Chu Kang, was criticised for speaking Singlish.

<text>Under One Roof is a 2002 American reality show on the UPN network. Hosted by Rob Nelson, the show&#x27;s premise was to pit five families against each other to win a Fijian beachfront house.

== Overview ==
In each episode the families would win a number of ribbons based on their rank in competition. Prior to the ribbon competition, another competition allowed the winning family to choose either an advantage in the ribbon contest, or a valuable prize. If the prize was selected, the second place family would receive the advantage. Every two episodes, the family with the fewest ribbons would be sent home, and the scores would be reset so that all families would again be on an equal footing for the next elimination. The winning family was decided in a single head-to-head competition with no advantage competition.

UPN has been criticized for having canceled the show, not once, but twice. After the first two episodes – aired in March and April – fared poorly in the ratings, the show was cancelled. It was brought back again in July as a summer replacement, repeating the first two episodes and airing the third, only to be cancelled again. The final four episodes never aired.

Due to the cancelation of the show, it was unknown if the winners would still receive the house. A standard game show eligibility clause states that the awarding of prizes may be revoked in the event that the episode does not air. Senior Vice President of UPN Joanne Lowry, said that all prizes, including the house that was built, have already been rewarded and will be able to be kept. Although it was never shown on TV, a representative from UPN said the winning family was the Skofields from Las Vegas.

== Cast ==
The five families that competed were:
* The Skofields (Mike, Holly, Matt, Brittany) &quot;(winners)&quot;
* The Hatmakers (Michelle, Jonathan, Daniel, and family friend Mark Anderson) &quot;(2nd place)&quot;
* The McRaes (Larry, Jeanell, Kirsten, Shannon, Trent) &quot;(3rd place)&quot;
* The Paganis (Jorge, Robin, Marchela, Giancarlo, Bianca) &quot;(4th place)&quot;
* The Distels (David, Lyn, Melissa, Mike) &quot;(5th place)&quot;

<doc id="936030" wikidata="Q151714" url="?curid=936030" title="American Idiot">
<text>American Idiot is the seventh studio album by the American rock band Green Day, released on September 21, 2004, by Reprise Records. As with their previous four albums, it was produced by Rob Cavallo in collaboration with the group. Recording sessions for &quot;American Idiot&quot; took place at Studio 880 in Oakland and Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, both in California, between 2003 and 2004. A concept album, dubbed a &quot;punk rock opera&quot; by the band members, &quot;American Idiot&quot; follows the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a lower-middle-class American adolescent anti-hero. The album expresses the disillusionment and dissent of a generation that came of age in a period shaped by tumultuous events such as 9/11 and the Iraq War. In order to accomplish this, the band used unconventional techniques for themselves, including transitions between connected songs and some long, chaptered, creative compositions presenting the album themes.

Following the disappointing sales of their previous album &quot;Warning&quot; (2000), the band took a break and then began what they had planned to be their next album, &quot;Cigarettes and Valentines&quot;. However, recording was cut short when the master tapes were stolen; following this, the band made the decision to start their next album from scratch. The result was a more societally critical, politically charged record which returned to the band&#x27;s punk rock sound following the more folk and power pop-inspired &quot;Warning&quot;, with additional influences that were not explored on their older albums. Additionally, the band underwent an &quot;image change&quot;, wearing red-and-black uniforms onstage, to add more theatrical presence to the album during performances and press events.

&quot;American Idiot&quot; became one of the most anticipated releases of 2004. It marked a career comeback for Green Day, charting in 27 countries, reaching for the first time the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the group and peaking at number one in 18 other countries. It has sold over 23 million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling album for the band (behind their 1994 major-label debut, &quot;Dookie&quot;) and one of the best-selling albums of the decade and all time. It was later certified 6× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2013. The album spawned five successful singles: the titular track, &quot;American Idiot&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;, &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot; and the Grammy Award for Record of the Year winner &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;.

&quot;American Idiot&quot; was very well received critically and commercially upon release, and has since been hailed as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for Album of the Year and won the Award for Best Rock Album at the 2005 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best Album at the Europe Music Awards and the Billboard Music Awards, winning the former. Its success inspired a Broadway musical, a documentary and an unmade feature film adaptation. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at 225 on their 2012 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and again in 2020, at 248. 

== Background ==
Green Day was one of the most popular rock acts of the 1990s. However, their 2000 album &quot;Warning&quot; was a commercial disappointment despite largely positive reviews. In early 2002, they embarked on the Pop Disaster Tour, headlining with Blink-182. The tour created momentum for the band, who were earning a reputation as &quot;elder statesmen&quot; of the pop punk scene, which consisted of bands like Good Charlotte, Sum 41, and New Found Glory.

Things had come to a point regarding unresolved personal issues between the three band members. The band was argumentative and miserable, according to the bassist Mike Dirnt, and needed to &quot;shift directions&quot;. In addition, the band released a greatest hits album, &quot;International Superhits!&quot;, which they felt was &quot;an invitation to midlife crisis&quot;. Singer Billie Joe Armstrong called Dirnt and asked him, &quot;Do you wanna do [the band] anymore?&quot; He felt insecure, having become &quot;fascinated and horrified&quot; by his reckless lifestyle, and his marriage was in jeopardy. Dirnt and Tré Cool viewed the singer as controlling, while Armstrong feared to show his bandmates new songs. Beginning in January 2003, the group had weekly personal discussions, which resulted in a revitalized feeling among the musicians. They settled on more musical input from Cool and Dirnt, with &quot;more respect and less criticism&quot;.

Green Day had spent much of 2002 recording new material at Studio 880 in Oakland, California for an album titled &quot;Cigarettes and Valentines&quot;, creating &quot;polka songs, filthy versions of Christmas tunes, [and] salsa numbers&quot; for the project, hoping to establish something new within their music. After completing 20 songs, the demo master tapes were stolen that November. In 2016, Armstrong and Dirnt said that they eventually recovered the material and were using it for ideas.

After the theft, the band consulted longtime producer Rob Cavallo. Cavallo told them to ask themselves if the missing tracks represented their best work. Armstrong said that they &quot;couldn&#x27;t honestly look at ourselves and say, &#x27;That was the best thing we&#x27;ve ever done.&#x27; So we decided to move on and do something completely new.&quot; They agreed and spent the next three months writing new material.

== Recording and production ==
The members of Green Day individually crafted their own ambitious 30-second songs. Armstrong recalled, &quot;It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. We kept connecting these little half-minute bits until we had something.&quot; This musical suite became &quot;Homecoming&quot;, and the band wrote another suite, &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot;. It changed the development of the album, and the band began viewing songs as more than their format—as chapters, movements, or potentially a feature film or novel. Soon afterward, Armstrong penned the title track, which explicitly addresses sociopolitical issues. The group then decided that they would steer the development of the album toward what they dubbed a &quot;punk rock opera.&quot;

Prior to recording, Green Day rented rehearsal space in Oakland, once again at Studio 880. Armstrong invited Cavallo to attend the sessions and help guide their writing processes. Cavallo encouraged the idea of a concept album, recalling a conversation the two had a decade prior, in which Armstrong expressed his desire for their career to have a &quot;Beatles-like arc to their creativity.&quot; During the sessions at Studio 880, Green Day spent their days writing material and would stay up late, drinking and discussing music. The band set up a pirate radio station from which it would broadcast jam sessions, along with occasional prank calls. The band demoed the album sufficiently so that it would be completely written and sequenced before they went to record.

Hoping to clear his head and develop new ideas for songs, Armstrong traveled to New York City alone for a few weeks, renting a small loft in the East Village of Manhattan. He spent much of this time taking long walks and participating in jam sessions in the basement of Hi-Fi, a bar in Manhattan. He began socializing with the songwriters Ryan Adams and Jesse Malin. Many songs from the album were written based on his time in Manhattan, including &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; and &quot;Are We the Waiting&quot;. While there, he also formulated much of the album&#x27;s storyline, about people &quot;going away and getting the hell out, while at the same time fighting their own inner demons.&quot;

With demos completed, Green Day relocated to Los Angeles. They first recorded at Ocean Way Recording, then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album. Cool brought multiple drum kits, including over 75 snares. Drum tracks were recorded on two-inch tape to produce a compressed sound and were transferred to Pro Tools to be digitally mixed with the other instruments. All drum tracks were produced at Ocean Way Studio B, picked for its high ceiling and acoustic tiling, which produced better sound. The songs were recorded in order as they appear on the track listing, a first for Green Day. Each song was recorded in its entirety before proceeding to the next. They reversed the order in which they recorded guitars and bass (recording the guitars first), as they heard that was how the Beatles recorded songs. Armstrong said that at points he expressed fear at the amount of work before him, likening it to climbing a mountain.

The band took a relaxed approach to recording. For five months, they stayed at a Hollywood hotel during the recording sessions, where they would often play loud music late at night, prompting complaints. The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his frequent hangovers. Armstrong described the environment: &quot;For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how we were &quot;supposed&quot; to behave as Green Day. For the first time, we fully accepted the fact that we&#x27;re rock stars.&quot; &quot;American Idiot&quot; took 10 months to complete, at a cost of $650,000. By the end of the process, Armstrong felt &quot;delirious&quot; regarding the album: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m on the cusp of something with this. [...] I really feel […] like we&#x27;re really peaking right now.&quot;

== Composition ==
=== Music ===
Speaking on the album&#x27;s musical content, Armstrong remarked, &quot;For us, &quot;American Idiot&quot; is about taking those classic rock and roll elements, kicking out the rules, putting more ambition in, and making it current.&quot; Part of recording the album was attempting to expand their familiar punk rock sound by experimenting with different styles such as new wave, Latin, and polka music. The band listened to various rock operas, including the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; (1972). Armstrong was particularly inspired by the Who&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, finding more in common with its &quot;power chord mod-pop aesthetic&quot; than other concept records, such as &quot;The Wall&quot; by Pink Floyd. In addition, they listened to the cast recordings of Broadway musicals &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, and they let contemporary music influence them, including the rappers Eminem and Kanye West, as well as the rock band Linkin Park. Armstrong considered rock music a &quot;conservative&quot; business with regard to the rigidity in which a band must release a single, create a music video, or head out on tour. He felt groups like the hip hop duo OutKast were &quot;kicking rock&#x27;s ass, because there&#x27;s so much ambition.&quot;

The band used more loud guitar sounds for the record. Armstrong said &quot;We were like, &#x27;Let&#x27;s just go balls-out on the guitar sound—plug in the Les Pauls and Marshalls and let it rip&#x27;&quot;. Armstrong added tracks of acoustic guitar-playing throughout the record to augment his electric guitar rhythms and Cool&#x27;s drumming.

For most of the record, Dirnt used an Ampeg SVT bass amplifier, recording with his signature Fender Precision Bass. For the album, he and Cavallo strived for a &quot;solid, big, thunderous&quot; bass sound as opposed to one centered on countermelodies. Dirnt ran his bass guitar through an Evil Twin direct box, a staple of his recording methods since &quot;Dookie&quot;. Cool also employs unorthodox instruments for punk music—timpani, glockenspiel, and hammer bells—which he received out of a promotional deal with Ludwig. These instruments are especially evident on &quot;Homecoming&quot; and on &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;, the latter of which includes an African bead gourd that was welded to a remote hi-hat pedal for future live performances. &quot;Extraordinary Girl&quot;, originally titled &quot;Radio Baghdad&quot;, features tablas in the intro performed by Cool. For &quot;Whatsername&quot;, Cool recorded drums in a room designed to record guitars to achieve a dry sound. With all these techniques and influences considered, critics have called the album pop-punk and alternative rock, but primarily the aforementioned punk rock.

=== Themes ===
&quot;American Idiot&quot; was inspired by contemporary American political events, particularly 9/11, the Iraq War, and the presidency of George W. Bush. There are only two overtly political songs on the album (&quot;American Idiot&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot;), but the album &quot;draws a causal connection between contemporary American social dysfunction […] and the Bush ascendancy.&quot; While the content is clearly of the times, Armstrong hoped it would remain timeless and become more an overarching statement on confusion.

Armstrong expressed dismay at the then-upcoming presidential election. He felt confused by the country&#x27;s culture war, noting the particular division among the general public on the Iraq War. Summing up his feelings in an interview at the time, he said, &quot;This war that&#x27;s going on in Iraq [is] basically to build a pipeline and put up a fucking Wal-Mart.&quot; Armstrong felt a duty to keep his sons away from violent images, including video games and news coverage of the war in Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. Armstrong noted divisions between America&#x27;s &quot;television culture&quot; (which he said only cared about cable news) versus the world&#x27;s view of America, which could be considered as careless warmongers. Dirnt felt similarly, especially so after viewing the 2004 documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. &quot;You don&#x27;t have to analyze every bit of information in order to know that something&#x27;s not fucking right, and it&#x27;s time to make a change.&quot; Cool hoped the record would influence young people to vote Bush out, or, as he put it, &quot;make the world a little more sane.&quot; He had previously felt that it was not his place to &quot;preach&quot; to kids, but felt there was so much &quot;on the line&quot; in the 2004 election that he must.

The album also takes aim at giant corporations putting small companies out of business. Cool made an example out of record shops closing when a national retailer makes it to town. &quot;It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s just one voice you can hear,&quot; he said. &quot;Not to sound like a preachy person, but it&#x27;s getting towards the Big Brother of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;— except here you have two or three corporations running everything.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===

&quot;American Idiot&quot; is a concept album that describes the story of a central character named Jesus of Suburbia, an anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong. It is written from the perspective of a lower-middle-class suburban American teen, raised on a diet of &quot;soda pop and Ritalin.&quot; Jesus of Suburbia hates his hometown and those close to him, so he leaves for the city. The second character introduced in the story is St. Jimmy, a &quot;swaggering punk rock freedom fighter par excellence.&quot; Whatsername, &quot;a &#x27;Mother Revolution&#x27; figure,&quot; is introduced as a nemesis of St. Jimmy in the song &quot;She&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;. The album&#x27;s story is largely indeterminate, because the group was unsure of where to lead the plot&#x27;s third quarter. In this sense, Armstrong decided to leave the ending up to the listeners&#x27; imagination. The two secondary characters exemplify the record&#x27;s main theme—&quot;rage versus love&quot;—in that while St. Jimmy is driven by &quot;rebellion and self-destruction,&quot; Whatsername is focused on &quot;following your beliefs and ethics.&quot; Jesus of Suburbia eventually decides to follow the latter, resulting in the figurative suicide of St. Jimmy, which is revealed to be a facet of his personality. In the album&#x27;s final song, Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well, to the point in which he can&#x27;t even remember her name.

Through the story, Armstrong hoped to detail coming of age in America at the time of the album&#x27;s release. While he considered their previous record heartfelt, he felt a more instinctual feeling to speak for the time period in which the album was released. He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the &quot;climate&quot; surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, &quot;As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules.&quot; In addition to the album&#x27;s political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled &quot;confusion and loss of individuality.&quot;

&quot;American Idiot&quot; contends that mass media has orchestrated paranoia and idiocy among the public, particularly cable news, which Armstrong felt had crossed the line from journalism to reality television, only showcasing violent footage intercut with advertisements. The song emphasizes strong language, juxtaposing the words &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;America&quot; to create what he imagined would be a voice for the disenfranchised. &quot;Holiday&quot; took two months to finish writing, because Armstrong continually felt his lyrics were not good enough. Encouraged by Cavallo, he completed the song. He later characterized the song as an outspoken &quot;fuck you&quot; to Bush. &quot;Give Me Novacaine&quot; touches on American reality television of that time, which Armstrong likened to &quot;gladiators in the coliseum.&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; was inspired by Bikini Kill&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Girl&quot;.

== Artwork ==
After finishing the music for the album, the band decided that the artwork needed to reflect the themes on the record, likening the change of image to a political campaign. Armstrong recalled, &quot;We wanted to be firing on all cylinders. Everything from the aesthetic to the music to the look. Just everything.&quot; Green Day drew inspiration from Chinese communist propaganda art the band saw in art galleries on Melrose Avenue and recruited artist Chris Bilheimer, who had designed the art for the previous records &quot;Nimrod&quot; and &quot;International Superhits!&quot; to create the cover. The band aimed for the cover to be &quot;at once uniform and powerful&quot;. The album&#x27;s artwork—&quot;a Posada-stark print of a heart-shaped hand grenade gripped in a blood-soaked fist&quot;—is representative of its political content. After listening to the new music on his computer, Bilheimer took note of the lyric &quot;And she&#x27;s holding on my heart like a hand grenade&quot; from &quot;She&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;. Influenced by artist Saul Bass&#x27;s poster for the 1955 drama film &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot;, Bilheimer created an upstretched arm holding a red heart-shaped grenade. Although he felt that red is the &quot;most overused color in graphic design&quot;, he felt that the &quot;immediate&quot; qualities of the color deemed it appropriate for use on the cover. He explained, &quot;I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s psychological theories of it being the same color of blood and therefore has the powers of life and death... And as a designer I always feel it&#x27;s kind of a cop-out, so I never used it before. But there was no way you couldn&#x27;t use it on this cover.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
&quot;American Idiot&quot; received largely positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 26 reviews. According to AllMusic, it earned Green Day &quot;easily the best reviewed album of their career.&quot; The website&#x27;s editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as either &quot;a collection of great songs&quot; or as a whole, writing that, &quot;in its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it&#x27;s something of a masterpiece&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; deemed it &quot;ambitious&quot; and successful in getting across its message, while &quot;keep[ing] its mood and method deliberately, tenaciously, and angrily on point&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; characterized it as &quot;an onslaught of varied and marvellously good tunes presented in an unexpectedly inventive way.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; called the album &quot;a powerful work, noble in both intent and execution.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; commended Green Day for trumping &quot;any pretension with melody and sheer fervor&quot;. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Jim DeRogatis wrote that the band had successfully &quot;hit upon an actual &#x27;adult&#x27; style of pop punk&quot;, while &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen wrote that they had steered away from the &quot;cartoonish&quot; qualities of their previous work in favor of more mature, politically oriented themes.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that despite being based on a musical theater concept &quot;that periodically makes no sense&quot;, Green Day &quot;makes the journey entertaining enough&quot;. It described some of the songs as forgettable, though, arguing the album focuses more on lyrics than music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the album could have been, and was, a mess, but that the &quot;individual tunes are tough and punchy enough to work on their own&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; also called &quot;American Idiot&quot; a mess—&quot;but a vivid, splashy, even courageous mess&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described it as a &quot;pompous, overwrought,&quot; but nonetheless &quot;glorious concept album&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; was more critical and wrote in a mixed review that although the album was heavily politically focused, &quot;slam-dancing is still possible&quot;. In a negative review, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called the album a &quot;dud&quot; and asserted that Armstrong&#x27;s lyrics eschew &quot;sociopolitical content&quot; for &quot;the emotional travails of two clueless punks—one passive, one aggressive, both projections of the auteur&quot;, adding that &quot;there&#x27;s no economics, no race, hardly any compassion.&quot;

Ian Winwood of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called it a &quot;modern day masterpiece&quot;. Josh Tyrangiel of &quot;Time&quot; said, &quot;For an album that bemoans the state of the union, it is irresistibly buoyant.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
In 2005, &quot;American Idiot&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album and was nominated in six other categories including Album of the Year. The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards it was nominated for at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards; the &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; video won six of those awards. A year later, &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In 2009, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named &quot;American Idiot&quot; the best album of the decade, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 60 in a similar list, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 22nd. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also listed &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; and &quot;American Idiot&quot; among the 100 best songs of the 2000s, at number 65 and 47 respectively. In 2005, the album was ranked number 420 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.
In 2012, the album was ranked number 225 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

== Release and commercial performance ==

&quot;American Idiot&quot; was released on September 21, 2004. It became Green Day&#x27;s first number one album in the United States, selling 267,000 copies in its first week of release, their biggest opening sales week. The album became 2005&#x27;s fourth-highest seller, moving over 3.4 million units. &quot;American Idiot&quot; remained in the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 upwards of a year following its release, staying on the chart for 101 weeks. The album also debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, selling 89,385 copies in the first week. The album has received certification awards in many territories; among them being certified six times platinum status in the United States and Australia, and diamond in Canada. , &quot;American Idiot&quot; has sold 23 million units worldwide.

The album spawned five singles: &quot;American Idiot&quot;, &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;, and &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot;. The title track was released to active rock and alternative radio stations preceding the album on August 6, 2004. Two weeks later, it became the band&#x27;s first song to place on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at number 61. Internationally, it peaked much higher, reaching number three in the United Kingdom, and debuting at number one in Canada. The song was released at a time before &quot;Billboard&quot; began accounting for internet sales in its chart positions; after &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; was released as the second single on November 29, it would peak at number two on the Hot 100. &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot; would follow as the third and fourth singles on March 14 and June 13, 2005, respectively, the former peaking at number nineteen and latter peaking at number six on the Hot 100. &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot; was released on November 14, 2005, as the final single; the band played the entire nine-minute composition for the longest performance to that point on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the week preceding the single. It did not perform as well on the charts as the preceding four songs.

Samuel Bayer directed music videos for all five of the album&#x27;s singles. In 2005, commenting on the success &quot;American Idiot&quot; brought the band, he stated, &quot;The Billie Joe that I work with now is not the same guy that walked onto the &quot;American Idiot&quot; set a year ago. Now, he&#x27;s a rock star. They were famous. They had done big stuff. But it&#x27;s transcended that. But he hasn&#x27;t changed. And they haven&#x27;t changed. They&#x27;re three friends who love one another.&quot; Courtney Love also commented on the success of the band, stating &quot;Billie Joe looks absolutely beautiful. You know how when people get super A-list, their face gets prettier? I think it&#x27;s perception. It&#x27;s something that happens in your subconscious&quot;. At the time of &quot;American Idiot&quot;″s release, the album was not sold in Wal-Mart due to its explicit content.

A 20th anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;American Idiot&quot; was released on October 25, 2024, featuring 15 unreleased demos, 15 live tracks recorded at Irving Plaza, 9 other unreleased live recordings and 14 songs previously available only as B-sides and bonus tracks.

== Touring ==

The band underwent &quot;a significant image change&quot; surrounding the album&#x27;s promotion, and they began to wear black and red uniforms onstage. Armstrong considered it a natural extension of his showmanship, which began in his childhood. Touring in support of the album began in the US, where the band performed in conservative stronghold states like Texas, Tennessee, and Georgia. The group headlined arenas that were only &quot;60 to 75 percent full&quot; and were often booed for performing songs from the album. Armstrong often chanted &quot;Fuck George W. Bush!&quot; Jonah Weiner of &quot;Blender&quot; likened the band&#x27;s live performances of the time to an &quot;anti-Bush rally.&quot; Armstrong admitted that they did &quot;everything to piss people off,&quot; including wearing a Bush mask onstage in weeks preceding the election.

The European tour sold 175,000 tickets in less than an hour. In April, the band began a one-month US arena tour. The band soon began playing stadiums, performing at New Jersey&#x27;s Giants Stadium, San Francisco&#x27;s SBC Park, and Los Angeles&#x27; Home Depot Center between September and October 2005.

In honor of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the album is currently being played in its entirety—alongside &quot;Dookie&quot;, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary—on their Saviors Tour.

==Legacy==

John Colapinto of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; summarized its immediate impact in a 2005 story:

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed it &quot;both a harbinger and a beneficiary of the Bush administration&#x27;s plummeting approval, selling steadily through 2005 as the response to Hurricane Katrina and the protracted war in Iraq turned much of the country against the government.&quot; &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot; became symbolic during various events such as the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina; one online blogger paired the song with television coverage of the disaster, creating a viral video.

Ian Winwood of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; said that the album pushed rock music back into the mainstream. &quot;American Idiot&quot; was considered a career comeback for Green Day, and their unexpected maturation &quot;stunned the music industry.&quot; In 2020 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at 248 on their updated list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

===Adaptations=== 
In late 2005, DJ Party Ben and producer Team9, under the shared alias Dean Gray (a spoonerism of &quot;Green Day&quot;), released an online-only mash-up version of the album—called &quot;American Edit&quot;. This became a cause célèbre when a cease and desist order was served by Green Day&#x27;s record label representatives at Reprise/Warner. Tracks include &quot;American Edit&quot;, &quot;Dr. Who on Holiday&quot;, &quot;Novocaine Rhapsody&quot;, and &quot;Boulevard of Broken Songs.&quot; Billie Joe Armstrong later stated that he heard one of the songs on the radio and &quot;enjoyed it.&quot;

==== Stage musical ====

An &quot;American Idiot&quot; stage musical adaptation premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2009. The musical was a collaboration between Green Day and director Michael Mayer. Green Day did not appear in the production, but the show featured an onstage band. The production transferred to Broadway at the St. James Theatre, and opened in April 2010. The show received mixed reviews from critics, but received a rave review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The show features all of the songs from the album &quot;American Idiot&quot;, including B-sides, as well as songs from Green Day&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot;. Armstrong appeared in the Broadway production as St. Jimmy multiple times. With his return in 2011, the show grossed over $1 million.

&quot;American Idiot&quot; won two Tony Awards: Best Scenic Design of a Musical for Christine Jones and Best Lighting Design of a Musical for Kevin Adams. It also received a nomination for Best Musical. The Broadway production closed in April 2011, after 27 previews and 421 regular performances. The first national tour started in late 2011. A documentary regarding the musical, titled &quot;Broadway Idiot&quot;, was released in 2013.

==== Film ====
Billie Joe Armstrong had at one point, prior to its release, suggested the album would make good material for an adapted feature film. Shortly after the album was released, there was speculation that &quot;American Idiot&quot; might be made into a film. In an interview with VH1, Armstrong said, &quot;We&#x27;ve definitely been talking about someone writing a script for it, and there&#x27;s been a few different names that have been thrown at us. It sounds really exciting, but for right now it&#x27;s just talk.&quot; On June 1, 2006, Armstrong announced in an interview with MTV that the movie was &quot;definitely unfolding&quot; and that &quot;every single week there&#x27;s more ideas about doing a film for &quot;American Idiot&quot;, and it&#x27;s definitely going to happen&quot;.

In April 2011, production company Playtone optioned the musical to develop a film version, and Universal Pictures began initial negotiations to distribute it. Michael Mayer, who directed the Broadway production, was named as director. Dustin Lance Black was initially hired to adapt the musical. Billie Joe Armstrong was asked to star as St. Jimmy, and the film was proposed for a 2013 release. Armstrong later posted on his Twitter account that he had not &quot;totally committed&quot; to the role but was interested in it.

In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, &quot;The idea is to get it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There&#x27;s not going to be a lot of dialogue and it probably should be a little shorter, too. After that, it just takes its &#x27;movie time&#x27; in getting done&quot;. He expected to finish the script by the end of the month.

In October 2016, in an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Armstrong revealed that the film was now being made at HBO and the script was getting rewrites. He confirmed he would reprise his Broadway role as St. Jimmy. In November 2016, Armstrong stated that the film was &quot;going to be a lot different from the musical. It&#x27;s kind of, more surreal but I think there&#x27;s going to be parts of it that might offend people – which is good. I think it&#x27;s a good time to offend people. I think there&#x27;s just going to be a lot of imagery that we couldn&#x27;t pull off in the musical in the stage version. You know, I don&#x27;t want to give away too much, but it will be shocking in a way which makes you think.&quot; In February 2020, Billie Joe Armstrong revealed to &quot;NME&quot; that plans for the film adaptation of &quot;American Idiot&quot; have been &quot;pretty much scrapped&quot;.

== Documentary ==

Heart Like a Hand Grenade is a 2015 film featuring Green Day during the recording of &quot;American Idiot&quot;. It was directed by John Roecker and filmed over the process of fifteen months between 2003 and 2004. It is a documentary about the songwriting and recording process of the album.

=== Release history ===
The film had a limited, one night release in Hollywood at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre on March 25, 2009, to a crowd of more than 400 people.

On July 15, 2014, director John Roecker announced on his Facebook page that the film would be released to the public.

Sound mix done and now off to Warner Brothers. I want to thank Scott Gawlik and Dylan Melody for their amazing talent and making this film incredible. Also thank you Chris Dugan for creating an &quot;American Idiot&quot; overture the one I wanted 11 years ago!&quot;

See you in September. &quot;Heart Like A Hand Grenade: The Making of American Idiot&quot; teaser coming soon. I want to thank my brothers Dylan Melody, Dean Gonzalez, Scott Gawlik for making my film how I envisioned it.

<text>Fenitrothion (IUPAC name: &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-dimethyl &quot;O&quot;-(3-methyl-4-nitrophenyl) phosphorothioate) is a phosphorothioate (organophosphate) insecticide that is inexpensive and widely used worldwide. Trade names include &quot;Sumithion&quot;, a 94.2% solution of fenitrothion.

==Health effects==

Fenitrothion at sublethal doses affected the motor movement of marsupials, and at acute dose levels it reduced the energy of birds.

In chronic (low) dose tests, unexpectedly only the lowest concentration (0.011 microgram/liter) of fenitrothion depressed the growth of an algae, though all of the chronic dose levels used were toxic in other ways to the algae.

Just half of fenitrothion&#x27;s minimally effective dose altered the thyroid structure of a freshwater murrel (the snakehead fish).

Cases of non-specific encephalopathy and fatty visceral changes (Reye&#x27;s syndrome) in children living in the vicinity of fenitrothion-spraying operations invoked the research described latterly in &quot;Science&quot;, and originally in &quot;The Lancet&quot;:
Further study showed that the illness was caused not by fenitrothion itself, but combinations which included the surfactants and the solvent (with or without the pesticide) clearly showed that pretreatment with these chemicals markedly increased the viral lethality in the test mice.

==Resistance==
In an unusual demonstration of resistance to pesticides, 8% of insects in farm fields were found to carry a symbiotic gut microbe that can metabolize and detoxify fenitrothion; after in-vitro tests showed that the microbe significantly increased the survival of fenitrothion-treated insects.

<text>The Dramatists Guild of America is a professional organization for playwrights, composers, and lyricists working in the U.S. theatre market. It was born in 1921 out of the Authors Guild, known then as Authors League of America, formed in 1912. 

Membership as an Associate Member is open to any person having written at least one stage play. Active Members are playwrights who have had at least one play produced in front of a paying audience or have had their work published by a major theatrical publisher. Student membership is also available for those enrolled in dramatic writing courses.

The Dramatists Guild works to negotiate better contracts for playwrights in professional markets and offers recommendations for contracts in other markets. The Business Affairs division assists playwrights by reviewing contracts for productions and maintains a set of contracts for Guild members to use when licensing their work.

&quot;The Dramatist&quot; is a bimonthly journal produced by the Dramatists Guild, which includes articles, interviews, and other information pertinent to playwrights.

==History==
1912 – The constitution and by-laws of the Authors’ League of America (which included 350 novelists, poets, dramatists, and magazine authors) were adopted December 13 and incorporated on December 18.

1915 – First attempt by a sub-committee of the Authors League at creating a Dramatic Contract to stake out the ill-defined rights of dramatists.
1917 – A committee headed by Cosmo Hamilton, in which Edward Childs Carpenter and Channing Pollock began their yeoman service to dramatists, drew up a new Standard Dramatic Form Contract. While some producers were cooperative, those who dominated the then powerful, tightly controlled Manager’s Protective Association resented its “gall.” The Shuberts sent a message via Augustus Thomas, that they would “close their theatres sooner than sign the proposed contract…managers would treat authors individually and in no other way, and that the part of good business was for a manager to get the best and most he could.”

1919 – The Authors’ League granted Channing Pollock’s suggestion that the playwrights form an autonomous committee of 32 “working dramatists,” to unite into a “Dramatic Committee” which by then had in all 112 adherents. Out of this, the Dramatists Guild was later born and baptized. Owen Davis is elected the first Guild President.

1920 – A Standard Form Minimum Dramatic Contract was negotiated between the Managers Protective Association and The Authors’ League (not the still amorphous Dramatists Guild). Despite modern improvements, the contract had two vital defects: its use was not mandatory, and its terms were non-enforceable. No manager or author was required to become a member of his respective organization, and no one could be penalized for not using the contract.

1921 - In order that the Authors’ League, by supplanting Bronson Howard’s Society of American Dramatists and Composers, might not lead to its elimination, a liaison was made with the Dramatists Guild. The two organizations, for a year, with the same officers were officially known as “The American Dramatists.”

1922 – Official naming: Dramatists Guild. Edward Childs Carpenter elected second DG president.

1924 – Arthur Richman elected third Guild president.

1926 – The birth of the first Minimum Basic Agreement (MBA). New clauses had crept into the existing polite 1920 agreement to which authors had to submit to get production; unjust trade habits were becoming precedents; red ink was blotting out protective clauses; and lastly, economic conditions had come into the theatre crying for adjustment in fairness to the managers themselves.

2021 – Amanda Green becomes the first woman elected as president of the Guild.

<text>Muir Glacier is a glacier in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is currently about wide at the terminus. As recently as the mid-1980s the glacier was a tidewater glacier and calved icebergs from a wall of ice 90 m (200 feet) tall.

The glacier is named after Scottish-born naturalist John Muir, who traveled around the area and wrote about it, generating interest in the local environment and in its preservation. His first two visits were in 1879 (at age 41) and 1880. During the visits, he sent an account of his visits in installments to the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot;. Later, he collected and edited these installments in a book, &quot;Travels in Alaska&quot;, published in 1915, the year after he died.

==Retreat==

Muir Glacier has undergone very rapid, well-documented retreat since its Little Ice Age maximum position at the mouth of Glacier Bay around 1780. In 1794, the explorer Captain George Vancouver found that most of Glacier Bay was covered by an enormous ice sheet, some in places.

In 1904 the glacier reportedly &quot;broke through the mountains&quot; with Pyramid Peak to the west and Mt. Wright and Mount Case to the east.

From 1892 to approximately 1980, it had retreated nearly . Between 1941 and 2004, the glacier retreated more than and thinned by over . Ocean water has filled the valley replacing the ice and creating Muir Inlet.

The 1941 image shows the Muir Glacier as a tidewater glacier, prominently up to 700m thick, with its terminus visible on the lower right corner of the photo, well connected to its tributary, the Riggs Glacier, visible in the upper right part of the photo.

By 1950, the Muir Glacier had retreated by more than 3 km and had thinned by more than 100m but remained connected to the Riggs Glacier.

By 2004, the Muir Glacier had retreated further inland, and its terminus was no longer visible in the photograph. The Riggs Glacier had also undergone significant changes, retreating by 0.25km and becoming disconnected from the Muir Glacier. Vegetation began to dominate the landscape where ice once prevailed.

<doc id="936049" wikidata="Q5629262" url="?curid=936049" title="Holographic Data Storage System">
<text>Holographic Data Storage System (HDSS) program was a US Federal government-funded consortium on holographic data storage by Teledyne Technologies, IBM and Stanford University, created in 1995. Work on the program began in 1994 and it was funded by DARPA.

==History==
Proposed in the 1960s, holographic storage records data by capturing the interference patterns between a modulated optical field and a reference field within a storage medium. The data is retrieved by diffracting the reference field off the hologram, reconstructing the original optical field containing the data. The holographic data storage system was created with the initial goals of developing several key components for the system, including a high-capacity, high-bandwidth spatial light modulator used for data input, optimized sensor arrays for data output, and a high-power red semiconductor laser. At the same time, the HDSS researchers were to explore issues relating to the optical systems architecture (such as multiplexing schemes and access modes), data encoding and decoding methods, signal processing techniques, and the requirements of target applications. Into the program&#x27;s final year, progress has been such that consortium member, IBM Research Division, believed that holograms could hold the key to high-capacity data storage in the next millennium.

==Mechanism==
Large amounts of data can be stored holographically because lasers are able to store pages of electronic patterns. Holographic storage is sometimes referred to as 3D storage within special optical materials as opposed to just on the surface. In traditional holography, each viewing angle gives a different aspect of the same object. With holographic storage, however, a different &#x27;page&#x27; of information is accessed.

Holographic storage uses two laser beams, a reference and a data beam, to create an interference pattern at a medium where the two beams intersect. This intersection causes a stable physical or chemical change which is stored in the medium.

During the reading sequence, the action of the reference beam and the stored interference pattern in the medium recreates this data beam which may be sensed by a detector array. The medium may be a rotating disk containing a polymeric material, or an optically sensitive single crystal. The key to making the holographic data storage system work is the second laser beam which is fired at the crystal to retrieve a page of data. It must exactly match the original reference beam angle. A difference of a thousandth of a millimeter will fail to retrieve the data. Holography is expected to be of value in archival or library storage applications where large quantities of data need to be retained at the lowest costs possible.

==Apparent benefits==
Since it involves no moving parts, holographic data storage has the potential for higher reliability compared to traditional hard disk technologies. Research conducted by IBM has demonstrated the potential for storing up to 1 TB of data within a crystal approximately the size of a sugar cube, with data transfer rates reaching one trillion bits per second. A significant hurdle remains in the development of a rewritable form of holographic storage.

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2006, a prototype holographic drive was demonstrated, which achieved a storage capacity of 300 GB, in contrast to the 100 GB capacity of Blu-ray discs at the time. It has been suggested that holographic disks could serve as a successor to Blu-ray.

<text>Grant Aleksander (born Grant Aleksander Kunkowski; August 6, 1960) is an American actor. He is best known for playing the role of Phillip Spaulding on the CBS Daytime soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, off and on from 1982 until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2009. He received a Soap Opera Digest Award and four Daytime Emmy Award nominations for his role on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. 

==Early life==
Aleksander was born in Baltimore, Maryland and raised in Timonium. He is the youngest of three sons. He attended McDonogh School, where he played football. He became interested in acting after a drama teacher encouraged him to try out for a school play. After high school, he enrolled at Washington and Lee University, where he starred in productions of &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;, &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He also appeared on stage in Baltimore, starring in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. He left Washington and Lee to study at New York University and the Circle in the Square Theatre. He eventually returned to Washington and Lee, earning his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Theatre in 2012.

==Career==
After moving to New York, Aleksander worked as a waiter and tried modeling. He appeared in an ABC Afterschool Special, &quot;A Very Delicate Matter,&quot; in 1982. He landed his big break when he was cast as Phillip Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. He initially played the role from 1982 to 1984, before leaving to pursue other opportunities.

Aleksander landed guest starring roles on &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, and &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;. He appeared in the TV movie &quot;Dark Mansions&quot; and the film &quot;Tough Guys&quot;. Returning to soaps, he had a brief stint as DJ Phillips on &quot;Capitol&quot; in 1986. 

He returned to &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Phillip Spaulding in 1986 and stayed until early 1991. He decided to leave due to burn out from the show&#x27;s fast paced schedule, as well as grief from the recent deaths of his parents. In 1993, Aleksander joined the cast of the ABC Daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; as Alec McIntyre. He stayed with &quot;AMC&quot; until 1996.

Aleksander returned to &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 1996 and continued playing the role of Phillip until 2004, when he was abruptly dismissed from the show. Media reports speculated on a number of possible reasons, including his high salary, and allegations that Aleksander was temperamental or had been feuding with the actress who portrayed his love interest. Aleksander said the dismissal was storyline dictated.

After being killed off, it was revealed in May 2006 that Phillip Spaulding was still alive. However, the character didn&#x27;t appear on camera again until Aleksander returned in February 2009. He stayed with &quot;Guiding Light&quot; until its final episodes in September 2009. 

During his time away from &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, Aleksander directed episodes of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in the film &quot;The Big Bad Swim&quot;, co-starring with Paget Brewster. He also had a role in &quot;Fields of Freedom&quot;, a historical film about the battle of Gettysburg. In 2008, he guest starred on &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, playing a soap opera doctor.

Aleksander joined the cast of the web series &quot;Tainted Dreams&quot; in 2013, playing Adam Clark. In late 2014, he returned to Washington and Lee University as a Guest Artist in the first &quot;Dick Sessoms Honorary Production&quot; of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;. Aleksander starred in &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; at Cape May Stage in 2015. He also appeared Off Broadway in &quot;Perfect Crime&quot; in May and June 2019. 

==Personal life==
Aleksander met his wife, attorney Sherry Ramsey, when they were cast in a play together as students at Washington and Lee University. They were married on September 19, 1987.

Aleksander and his wife have rescued many animals and are supporters of PETA.

<text>The 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Vancouver, British Columbia, from 30 July to 7 August 1954. This was the fifth edition of the event that would eventually become known as the Commonwealth Games, the second post-war Games, the second Canadian Games after the inaugural event in Hamilton and the first event since the name change from British Empire Games took effect in 1952.

It was at these games that the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; took place between Roger Bannister and John Landy at Empire Stadium. This was the first time these two (and at that time the only two) sub-four-minute mile runners appeared in the same race, and also the first time two runners broke four minutes in the same race. On the same afternoon, Jim Peters, the holder of the world best time for the marathon, entered the stadium 17 minutes ahead of his nearest rival, but collapsed on his final lap, and never completed the race.

The games were attended by 24 nations and 662 competitors.

<text>Cross Sound is a passage in the Alexander Archipelago in the southeastern region of the U.S. state of Alaska, located between Chichagof Island to its south and the mainland to its north. It is long and extends from the Gulf of Alaska to Icy Strait.

Cross Sound was named by James Cook in 1778 because he found it on May 3, designated on his calendar as Holy Cross day.

The Cape Spencer Light marks the north side of the entrance to the sound from the Gulf of Alaska.
Dicks Arm is an inlet on northern Cross Sound.

<text>In social sciences and other domains, representative sequences are whole sequences that best characterize or summarize a set of sequences. In bioinformatics, representative sequences also designate substrings of a sequence that characterize the sequence.

== Social sciences ==

In Sequence analysis in social sciences, representative sequences are used to summarize sets of sequences describing for example the family life course or professional career of several thousands individuals.

The identification of representative sequences proceeds from the pairwise dissimilarities between sequences. One typical solution is the medoid sequence, i.e., the observed sequence that minimizes the sum of its distances to all other sequences in the set. An other solution is the densest observed sequence, i.e., the sequence with the greatest number of other sequences in its neighborhood. When the diversity of the sequences is large, a single representative is often insufficient to efficiently characterize the set. In such cases, an as small as possible set of representative sequences covering (i.e., which includes in at least one neighborhood of a representative) a given percentage of all sequences is searched.

A solution also considered is to select the medoids of relative frequency groups. More specifically, the method consists in sorting the sequences (for example, according to the first principal coordinate of the pairwise dissimilarity matrix), splitting the sorted list into equal sized groups (called relative frequency groups), and selecting the medoids of the equal sized groups.

The methods for identifying representative sequences described above have been implemented in the R package TraMineR.

== Bioinformatics ==
Representative sequences are short regions within protein sequences that can be used to approximate the evolutionary relationships of those proteins, or the organisms from which they come. Representative sequences are contiguous subsequences (typically 300 residues) from ubiquitous, conserved proteins, such that each orthologous family of representative sequences taken alone gives a distance matrix in close agreement with the consensus matrix.

=== Use ===
Protein sequences can provide data about the biological function and evolution of proteins and protein domains. Grouping and interrelating protein sequences can therefore provide information about both human biological processes, and the evolutionary development of biological processes on earth; such sequence clusters allow for the effective coverage of sequence space. Sequence clusters can reduce a large database of sequences to a smaller set of &quot;sequence representatives&quot;, each of which should represent its cluster at the sequence level. Sequence representatives allow the effective coverage of the original database with fewer sequences. The database of sequence representatives is called &quot;non-redundant&quot;, as similar (or redundant) sequences have been removed at a certain similarity threshold.
