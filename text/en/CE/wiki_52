<text>Silvius Magnago (5 February 191425 May 2010) was a South Tyrolean politician who served as Chairman of the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party from 1957 to 1991 and as Governor of South Tyrol from 1960 to 1989.

== Biography ==

Magnago was born in Merano, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, on 5 February 1914. In 1936 he graduated from the grammar school of the Franciscans in Bolzano. He studied law at the University of Bologna and graduated with a JD in June 1940. Because of his rejection of Italian Fascism he chose to move to Germany in 1939, but remained first in South Tyrol, where he worked in Bolzano for a commission to estimate the assets of the Tyroleans following the South Tyrol Option Agreement. He was eventually conscripted into the German Army as a lieutenant, and sent to the Eastern Front, where a severe injury lead to the amputation of his left leg.

In the postwar period Magnago started his political activities in the municipal council of Bolzano as a member of the newly founded South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party (SVP). From 1948 to 1952 he acted as the city&#x27;s vice-mayor. In 1948, he was also elected for the first time to the Council of South Tyrol and Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige, where he remained until 1988. Magnago became chairman (&quot;Obmann&quot;) of his party in 1957, and held that function until 1991. In 1957, Magnago was the central figure of a strategic turn of his party: up to that year the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party had unsuccessfully tried to gain some margins of self-governance via a soft policy of alliances with the governing Democrazia Cristiana. Under the new leader and new motto &quot;Los von Trient&quot; (i.e. &quot;away from Trento&quot;, with regard to the regional capital) the SVP started to take a harder line, in order to obtain a devolution of powers to the provincial level of administration. From 1960 to 1989 Magnago was the governor (&quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;) of the autonomous province of South Tyrol. His major political success was the commencement of the second Statute of Autonomy in 1972, which distinctly extended South Tyrol&#x27;s legislative and executive competencies.

After suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for several years, Magnago died in Bolzano on 25 May 2010.

==Legacy==

Due to his long-time commitment to self-governance of his native province, he is widely regarded as the &quot;father of South Tyrolean autonomy&quot;.

<doc id="920370" wikidata="Q122735" url="?curid=920370" title="Leamouth">
<text>Leamouth is a locality in the Blackwall area of Poplar, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The area takes its name from the former &quot;Leamouth Wharf&quot; and lies on the west side of the confluence of the Bow Creek stretch of the Lea, at its confluence with the River Thames. 

The neighbourhood consists of two small peninsulas, separated from the rest of Poplar by the remaining part of the East India Docks. The northern peninsula lies in a hairpin meander and is named &quot;Goodluck Hope&quot; after one of the adjacent reaches of the Lea, while the other is known as &quot;Orchard Place&quot;. The area was traditionally the easternmost part of Middlesex, with Essex on the other side of the Lea.

The area was long referred to locally as &quot;Bog Island&quot;, due to its inaccessibility and propensity to flood; however the building of the Thames Barrier and the artificial raising of the more vulnerable riverside land, means the nickname refers to a now much reduced threat.

==Administration==
The area was historically part of the &quot;Hamlet of Poplar&quot;, an autonomous area of the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney. The &quot;Hamlet of Poplar&quot; became an independent parish in 1817. The civil parish of Poplar had a vestry committee which organised services such as poor relief and road maintenance.

==History==

Orchard Place was the name of its manor house on the spit; this had become an eponymous public house from 1800–60. Orchard Place gives its name to the area&#x27;s main street with extends into both of the local peninsulas.

===Isolation===
Always an isolated location, Leamouth was made more inaccessible by the construction of the East India Docks, which opened in 1806. After that, the only access was from Leamouth Road which connects to a remote part of the East India Dock Road. Improved road connections were made available in the late 20th century.

===Social condition===
To house the area&#x27;s workers, there were about 100 small two-storied cottages – built from the 1820s and condemned in 1935. There was the Bow Creek school (founded in 1865), but few shops, and &quot;The Crown&quot;, a public house, opened about 1840. By the late 19th century the vicinity of Orchard Place had become a deprived and overcrowded area. In the late 1930s, all homes and shops were demolished in a slum clearing project with residents moved out of the area.

===Industry===
The Thames Plate Glass Works was a major employer until its closure 1874; many of the hands – who had migrated to the area from Tyneside and St Helens in the 1840s – followed the glassworks to New Albany, Indiana. The site of the glass works was subsequently occupied by Pura Foods Pura Foods vegetable oil refinery until its closure in 2006. For many years the sugar firm Fowler&#x27;s, a significant maker of treacle, was in Leamouth.

There were iron and engineering works, and shipping interests such as Samuda Brothers, Castle Shipping Line, Orchard House Yard and the Thames Iron Works. The Thames Ironworks was based at the mouth of Bow Creek at the confluence of the Lea and Thames. The yard started at Leamouth Wharf, on the Blackwall side of the Lea, and subsequently extended to include a much larger site at Canning Town, in the parish and borough or West Ham, on the eastern side. These two parts of the shipyard were linked by a chain ferry capable of carrying 200 workers at a time. The yard was responsible for many shipbuilding and other engineering projects including the revolutionary HMS Warrior and the dreadnought HMS Thunderer.
===Sporting legacy===
The Thames Ironworks Yard shut in 1912, but its work team Thames Ironworks F.C., founded in 1895, continues to the current day as West Ham United. Another Leamouth shipyard was the repair yard of the Castle Shipping Line, their works team Castle Swifts would indirectly merge with the Thames Ironworks football team in 1895.

==Contemporary Leamouth==
Trinity Buoy Wharf contains London&#x27;s only lighthouse. There are also live-work units, many in the form of the Container Cities. 

===Redevelopment projects===
The London City Island is a major redevelopment project by architects Glenn Howells that will provide 1,706 homes, stores, shops, restaurants, cafés, and arts facilities including the English National Ballet. Goodluck Hope is a residential-led development by Todd Architects comprising 804 apartments, lofts and townhouses.

===Roads===
The Leamouth Peninsula has historically had poor transport links compared to the rest of Poplar, today it is connected to it by a main road splitting its halves: the A1020 Lower Lea Crossing which is a local by-pass of the A13.

===Public transport===

The &quot;Jubilee&quot; pedestrian bridge across the Lea links the area to the east bank of the Lea, and Canning Town station.

Leamouth has been served by the London Buses network for the first time by the D3 to Bethnal Green which starts and ends on Orchard Place since 2017. The N550 between Canning Town station and Blackwall was rerouted via Leamouth to provide night links whenever access to Canning Town station is restricted; implemented in September 2018.

<text>Laugavegur () is the primary commercial artery of downtown Reykjavík, Iceland and one of the oldest shopping streets. The name means &quot;wash road&quot;, as it used to lead to the hot springs in Laugardalur where in olden times the women of Reykjavík took their laundry for washing.

It was constructed in 1885 as a result of town council&#x27;s decision. It experienced economic setbacks mostly because shopping malls opened elsewhere, most notably Kringlan that opened in 1987 and Smáralind that opened in 2001. It maintains the charm of a historical shopping street and is still home to the more exclusive stores in Iceland.

It is also home to many bars, nightclubs and restaurants. On Friday and Saturday nights, the street is often filled with people all night long.

<text>John Sutcliffe (died 1987) was a British fetish clothing designer and publisher of the fetish magazine &quot;AtomAge&quot;.

In the 1950s he was divorced because his feelings about leather had led to him being diagnosed as mentally ill and treatment failed to change him.

He began his AtomAge fetish clothing business in 1957, registering it as a “manufacturer of weatherproofs for lady pillion riders”.

He was an influence on the leather catsuits worn by Emma Peel in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and created the leather catsuit worn by Marianne Faithfull in the 1968 film &quot;The Girl on a Motorcycle&quot;.

Sutcliffe published &quot;AtomAge&quot; magazine, a fetish magazine that was an offshoot of his fetish clothing business. The magazine has been called the &quot;underground bible of leather, rubber and vinyl fetish wear throughout the 1970s&quot; and documented Britain&#x27;s S/M scene. The first AtomAge clothing catalogue was published in 1965 and it expanded into a magazine in 1972. The magazine ended in 1980.

Sutcliffe&#x27;s work helped inspire Sex, a boutique run by Vivienne Westwood and her then-partner Malcolm McLaren at 430 King&#x27;s Road, London between 1974 and 1976, which specialized in clothing that defined the look of the punk movement. 

In 1982 Sutcliffe published a novel by Jim Dickson called &quot;The Story Of Gerda&quot;, about bondage and fetishism. A copy of it was sent to the police, and to keep from being prosecuted Sutcliffe agreed to have all stock and AtomAge magazine plates destroyed.

He created a sewing needle for vinyl that improved the ability to stitch and work that material, and a method for attaching a muslin-type fabric to latex, which after that could be securely sewn. He also created a sewing machine specifically for leather and asked Singer to manufacture it, but as remembered by his friend Robert Henley, &quot;Singer were so horrified, they called the police.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2023 he was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

<doc id="920383" wikidata="Q17514423" url="?curid=920383" title="Caproni Ca.1 (1914)">
<text>The Caproni Ca.1 was an Italian heavy bomber of the World War I era.

== Development and design ==

The Ca.1 was a three-engine biplane of fabric-covered wooden construction. It had four crew members in an open central nacelle: two pilots, a front gunner, and rear gunner-mechanic, who manned upper machine guns, standing upon the central engine in a protective cage, just in front of the rear propeller. The Ca.1 had a tricycle landing gear.

Italy and Russia were the first countries to start developing a heavy bomber capability before World War I. The first heavy bomber, designed by Gianni Caproni was a twin-boom biplane, featuring a layout that included three 67 kW (80 hp) Gnome rotary engines housed one behind the other in a central nacelle, the rearmost driving a pusher propeller, and the other two driving tractor propellers mounted on the fronts of the two booms. Referred to by Caproni as the Caproni 260 hp and retrospectively, after the war, as the Ca.30), this design flew in a slightly modified form (later called the Ca.31) in October 1914.

Test flights revealed the power to be insufficient and the engine layout unworkable. Caproni altered the aircraft, retaining the pusher engine in its original location and moving the other two engines to the front of the booms, directly driving the propellers. With more powerful inline engines, the air arm of the Italian Army became interested in purchasing the Caproni 300 hp (later known as the Ca.32), which they designated the Ca.1. A total of 166 aircraft were delivered between August 1915 and December 1916.

Some Ca.1s survived the war to be rebuilt as airliners, able to carry up to six passengers. This conversion became known as the Ca.56 in Caproni&#x27;s postwar naming scheme.

There is some variation in published sources over early Caproni designations. The confusion stems, in part, from three separate schemes used to designate these aircraft – Caproni&#x27;s in-house designations of the time, those used by the Italian Army, and designations created after the war by Caproni to refer to past designs.

==Operational history==
The Ca.1 entered service with the Italian Army in the middle of 1915 and first saw action on August 20, 1915, attacking the Austrian air base at Aisovizza. Fifteen bomber squadrons (1-15 &quot;Squadriglia&quot;) were eventually equipped with Ca.1, Ca.2, and Ca.3 bombers, bombing mostly targets in Austria-Hungary. The 12th squadron operated in Libya. In 1918 three squadrons (3, 14 and 15) operated in France.

<doc id="920385" wikidata="Q3657948" url="?curid=920385" title="Caproni Ca.2">
<text>The Caproni Ca.2 was an Italian heavy bomber of the World War I era.

==Development==
The Ca.2 was a minor development of the Caproni Ca.1 twin-boom bomber of 1914. It had become evident early in the Ca.1&#x27;s service life that the design could benefit from more power. Caproni therefore replaced the central, pusher engine of the aircraft with a more powerful one. Caproni referred to this as the Caproni 350 hp at the time, and the Italian Army dubbed it the Ca.2. No separate number seems to have been allocated to it in Caproni&#x27;s postwar redesignation scheme.

Only nine aircraft were built, supplied to the Italian Army alongside deliveries of Ca.1s between August 1915 and December 1916.

The benefits of increased power encouraged Caproni to continue in this direction, leading to the definitive Caproni Ca.3.

==Description==
The Caproni Ca.2 was a trimotor biplane with an engine mounted on the rear of the central nacelle, and two others mounted on the front of twin booms, which held the tail. It was largely of wooden construction, covered with fabric. The crew of four were in an open central nacelle (front gunner, two pilots and rear gunner-mechanic). The rear gunner manned upper machine guns, standing over the central engine in a protective &quot;cage,&quot; just in front of its propeller. It was fitted with tricycle landing gear.

Armament consisted of two to four Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns, one on a front ring mount and one, two or sometimes even three on an upper ring mount. Bombs were suspended under the central nacelle.

<text>The pink-headed duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) is a large diving duck that was once found in parts of the Gangetic plains of India, Nepal, parts of Maharashtra, Bangladesh and in the riverine swamps of Myanmar but has been feared extinct since the 1950s. Numerous searches have failed to provide any proof of continued existence. It has been suggested that it may exist in the inaccessible swamp regions of northern Myanmar and some sight reports from that region have led to its status being declared as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; rather than extinct. The genus placement has been disputed and while some have suggested that it is close to the red-crested pochard (&quot;Netta rufina&quot;), others have placed it in a separate genus of its own. It is unique in the pink colouration of the head combined with a dark body. A prominent wing patch and the long slender neck are features shared with the common Indian spot-billed duck. The eggs have also been held as particularly peculiar in being nearly spherical.

==Description==

The male pink-headed duck is unmistakable when a good view is had. Both sexes are 41–43 cm and long-billed with long necks and peaked heads. The male has a pink bill, head and neck while the female has a pale pinkish head and neck with a paler bill. The black of the body extends as a narrow strip on the front of the neck. Wings have a leading white edge. In flight it would not contrast as much as the syntopic white-winged duck. Wing does not have the dark trailing edge of the red-crested pochard. Confusion with male red-crested pochards stems mainly from observations of swimming birds, as the latter species also has a conspicuous red head (although the color is actually very different from the pink-headed duck). Indian spot-billed ducks, on the other hand, can look similar to female pink-headed ducks when in flight and seen from a distance, and if seen from behind, they could be mistaken for males too. The upper side of the wing is distinguishing, with dark green secondaries (speculum) and prominent white tertiaries in the spot-billed duck and a pinkish-beige speculum, much lighter than its surroundings, in the pink-headed duck. If the upper part of the wings cannot be reliably seen, they are all but indistinguishable except to expert observers in good visibility conditions. Young birds had a nearly whitish head without a trace of pink and a mellow two note call &quot;wugh-ah&quot; has been attributed to the species. 

Its breeding habitat is lowland marshes and pools in tall-grass jungle. The nest is built amongst grass. The eggs, six or seven in a clutch, are very spherical and creamy white. The eggs measure 1.71 to 1.82 inches long and 1.61 to 1.7 inches wide. They were believed to have been non-migratory and found singly or in pairs and very rarely in small groups. Pink-headed ducks are believed to have eaten water plants and molluscs. Like &quot;Netta&quot; species, they typically up-ended or dabbled for food and did not dive like a pochard.

==Distribution==

Allan Octavian Hume and Stuart Baker noted that the stronghold of the species was north of the Ganges and west of the Brahmaputra, mainly in Maldah, Purnea, Madhubani and Purulia districts of present-day Bihar. It was said to be commoner in Singhbum. Hume collected a specimen in Manipur which he noted was very rare, hiding among dense reeds in Loktak Lake. Edward Blyth claimed that it was found in the Rakhine state of Burma. Brian Houghton Hodgson obtained specimens from Nepal. A few records were also noted from Delhi, Sindh and Punjab. The populations (possibly) undertook local seasonal movements, resulting in scattered historic records as far as Punjab, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Thus, resulting in rare sightings of the species in Maharashtra. Birds were also reported from the Oudh region some from very close to Lucknow. Specimens were shot at Najafgarh lake in the Delhi district. Jerdon obtained specimens of the bird from further south although he did not personally observe any in the wild until he visited Bengal.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The pink-headed duck was described by John Latham in 1790 under the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. In describing the species, it is possible that he made of use of a painting in the collection of Lady Impey, wife of Sir Elijah Impey who was Chief Justice of court in Calcutta from 1774 to 1783. Mary Impey maintained a menagerie in Calcutta and commissioned Indian artists such as Bhawani Das from Patna to illustrate animals in the collection. The Impeys moved to England, and after the death of her husband, she sold these paintings at auction in 1810. Some of them were acquired by the 13th Earl of Derby.

The genus &quot;Rhodonessa&quot; was originally created for this species alone. Jean Delacour and Ernst Mayr, in their 1945 revision of the family Anatidae considered it a somewhat abnormal member of the &quot;Anatini&quot; (or river-ducks) group because the hind toe is slightly lobed, display behaviour and the tendency to feed at the surface. The birds were observed in European aviaries and although they never bred, the males displayed often and this involved puffing the neck feathers, lowering the neck to rest on the back and then stretching up the neck while producing a wheezy whistle like a mallard. A study of its tracheal anatomy by Alfred Henry Garrod in 1875 suggested that it had a &quot;slight fusiform dilatation&quot; in the anterior syringeal region. The &quot;bulba ossea&quot; at the lower part of the male syrinx is peculiar in being swollen. The colour pattern has also been considered unique, lacking any of the metallic colours on the secondaries that are characteristic of the Anatini. The other unique feature being the somewhat large and nearly spherical shape of the eggs. All of these features supporting the retention of the species in a separate genus. Such mid-tracheal swellings were found only in Mergini and Aythyini and is extremely rare in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. This tracheal bulla is rounded in &quot;Anas&quot; but angular with fenestrae in &quot;Netta&quot; and &quot;Aythya&quot;. Johnsgard considered &quot;Marmaronetta&quot; and &quot;Rhodonessa&quot; as intermediate in form. Based on the available morphological and behavioural evidence, especially the structure of the humerus and the structure of tracheal rings, Sidney Dillon Ripley suggested that it was undoubtedly in the Aythyini.

A study found that &quot;Rhodonessa&quot; was closely allied to the red-crested pochard (&quot;Netta rufina&quot;) suggesting that the two species be placed in the same genus. &quot;Rhodonessa&quot; was described prior to &quot;Netta&quot; which would then make &quot;Rhodonessa rufina&quot; the name of choice, however these changes have not been widely accepted. The pink colour is derived from a carotenoid pigment which is unusual among ducks and known only from a few other species such as the pink-eared duck which are not closely related.

==Status==

This duck formerly occurred in eastern India, Nepal, Bangladesh and northern Myanmar, but is now probably extinct. It was always rare, and the last confirmed sighting, by C. M. Inglis, was from Bhagownie, Darbhangha District, in June 1935, with reports from India persisting until the early 1960s. These include reports from Monghyr and from near Shimla. Sidney Dillon Ripley considered it likely extinct in 1950.

In 1988, Rory Nugent, an American birder, and Shankar Barua of Delhi, reported spotting the elusive bird on the banks of the Brahmaputra. The pair started their quest for the bird at Saikhoa ghat on the north-eastern end of the river on the Indian side of the border. After 29 days of sailing, Nugent said that he saw the pink-headed duck amidst a flock of other waterbirds. However, Nugent and Barua&#x27;s claimed sighting has not been widely accepted. Reports of pink-headed ducks after the 1960s have been received from the largely unexplored Mali Hka and Chindwin Myit drainages in Northern Myanmar. While the area is not very well surveyed by scientists, searches have been inconclusive and confusion with the red-crested pochard and the Indian spot-billed duck has been a common source of supposed pink-headed duck sightings. A report on a survey in the Hu Kaung valley in November 2003 concluded that there is sufficient reason to believe that pink-headed ducks may still exist in Northern Myanmar&#x27;s Kachin State, but a thorough survey of the Nat Kaung river between Kamaing and Shadusup in October 2005 failed to find this species; a number of interesting ducks were observed, but they turned out to be Indian spot-billed ducks or white-winged ducks. Suggestions have been made that it may be nocturnal.

In 2017, an expedition to find the species by Global Wildlife Conservation also failed, with evidence indicating that the biodiversity in the general area around Indawgyi Lake and its surrounding areas was heavily declining due to habitat degradation. Anecdotes from residents in the area, however, indicate that the bird may have lived in the area far more recently than the last confirmed report from 1910, possibly as recently as 2010. One resident stated that a pink-headed duck was sighted in 1998, associating with a flock of gadwall and pintail. Another, more dubious report stated that shortly after a failed expedition in the area by Birdlife International ended, a local hunter caught a live male and a female or juvenile pink-headed duck, and contacted Myanmar&#x27;s Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association to sell it to them for a fee. The offer was declined, and the hunter killed both ducks. Another hunter recalled that when the habitat was in good condition, pink-headed ducks were regulars in the area, possibly up to 2014. They were apparently most common during February, and he also could mimic their possible calls, though it is unknown whether these calls were truly by pink-headed ducks. The hunter also said that there were large, impassable ponds in the wetland&#x27;s center that may still hold pink-headed ducks, but these could only be accessed with a drone, which are banned in the region.

The reason for its disappearance was probably habitat destruction. It is not known why it was always considered rare, but the rarity is believed to be genuine (and not an artefact of insufficient fieldwork) as its erstwhile habitat was frequently scoured by hunters in Colonial times. The pink-headed duck was much sought after by hunters and later as an ornamental bird, mainly because of its unusual plumage. Like most diving ducks, it was not considered good eating, which should facilitate the survival of any remnant birds. The last specimen was obtained in 1935 in Darbhanga by C. M. Inglis. Some birds were also kept in the aviaries of Jean Théodore Delacour in Clères (France) and Alfred Ezra at Foxwarren Park (England) where the last known birds lived in captivity. The only known photographs of the species were taken here and include one of a pair taken around 1925 by David Seth-Smith.

<text>Kringlan () is a shopping mall located in the Icelandic capital region. It is the second largest in the country, after Smáralind in Kópavogur, with over 180 shops and restaurants. It was constructed in 1987, and includes a Hagkaup supermarket, a library, a theatre, a cinema, as well as a selection of well-known restaurants and retailers. 

Kringlan lies on the busiest traffic intersection in Reykjavík. Icelandic state television RÚV’s headquarters are also nearby. Reykjavík City Theatre lies adjacent to the shopping centre.

Kringlan has some department stores which are H&amp;M, Hagkaup, Next, 66North and Bónus.

On 15th June 2024, a fire broke out in the shopping mall&#x27;s roof. Due to the fire, it had to remain closed until 20th June.

It was featured in the film &quot;Dreamland&quot; (2010).

==Name==
The name is derived from the Kringla marsh or Kringlumýri . A literal translation into English could either be &#x27;circle&#x27; or &#x27;pretzel&#x27;, though the mall is neither circular nor has it anything to do with pretzels.

<text>Théophile Alajouanine (; 12 June 1890 – 2 May 1980) was a French neurologist.

Théophile Alajouanine was born in Verneix, Allier. He was a student of Joseph Jules Dejerine and a colleague of Georges Guillain and Charles Foix. He was a prolific writer on many topics but was particularly interested in aphasia.

A great scholar and enthusiastic bibliophile, Alajouanine had privileged relationships with famous writers during his neurological and neuropsychological career. Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s biography and works provided him with a penetrating look into the world of epilepsy. He was the composer Ravel&#x27;s neurologist, and published an account of the composer&#x27;s aphasia.

The &quot;Laboratoire Théophile-Alajouanine&quot;, Centre hospitalier Côte-des-Neiges, Montréal is named after him.

==Associated eponyms==
* Foix–Alajouanine syndrome: a rare disease of the spinal cord characterized by dysfunction of the spinal cord due to a dural arteriovenous malformation.
* Marie–Foix–Alajouanine syndrome: ataxia of the cerebellum in advanced age. Frequently due to abuse of alcohol.

<doc id="920407" wikidata="Q6275501" url="?curid=920407" title="Jongleurs (comedy club)">
<text>Jongleurs is a chain of comedy clubs in the United Kingdom, running since 1983. The business is now owned by Kev Orkian.

== Early years ==

Maria Kempinska established and opened the first Jongleurs club in 1983 in Battersea, London. In 1985 Kempinska met her business partner John Davy and they went on to create a number of comedy clubs around the UK in the following years.
By 2000, there were eight Jongleurs venues across the UK. Regent Inns plc, the owners of Walkabout, bought the clubs. Kempinska and Davy retained certain rights to the brand name, as well as creative control over booking acts.

With Regent Inns in financial trouble, the Cardiff venue was closed in January 2009 and in October that year, Regent Inns went into prepacked administration, allowing for a management buy-out which resulted in the formation of Intertain UK. As a result of this administration, Jongleurs venues in Southampton, Nottingham, Bristol, Oxford and Bow (London) all closed. The sites in Oxford and Nottingham were later reopened by rival chain The Glee Club. As a result of the management buy out, Intertain UK decided to end its relationship with Jongleurs and all the remaining clubs were rebranded as Highlight in January 2010.

== Rejuvenation and subsequent closures ==
Kempinska and Davy set about building a new chain of Jongleurs clubs. Hammersmith opened a month after the Regent Inns collapse and Bournemouth, Notting Hill and Clacton followed shortly after. Momo Leisure secured a franchise and opened a new club in Nottingham in 2010. In September 2010 they opened a new venue at Novus Leisure club Sway in Covent Garden and three more in Tiger Tiger venues.
Nightclub operators Luminar licensed the brand to 12 of their venues around the country in 2011. Later in the year, Luminar was put into administration and although all the clubs hosting Jongleurs nights avoided the first closures, the venues in Swansea, Basildon, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne and Norwich were all closed by February 2012.

== Current ==
Kev Orkian purchased the Jongleurs brand in May 2020 during the pandemic. He also founded entertainment brands Howlin&#x27; Comedy Club Ltd, Howlin&#x27; Entertainment Ltd &amp; British Pantomime Academy. Orkian has set out to redevelop the Jongleurs brand and bring the quality of what it stood for when it first opened.

<doc id="920431" wikidata="Q714130" url="?curid=920431" title="Henri Gastaut">
<text>Henri Jean Pascal Gastaut (April 15, 1915, Monaco – July 14, 1995 Marseille) was a French neurologist and epileptologist.

== Biography ==
Gastaut was educated in medicine at the University of Marseille, obtaining his medical doctorate in 1945. Thereafter he trained in neurology with Henri Roger and in neuroanatomy with Lucien Cornil in Marseille. In 1953 he became head of the neurobiological laboratories at the Marseille Hospital. In 1954 he succeeded Cornil as professor of anatomical pathology and in 1960 he was appointed as director of the regional centre for epileptic children. In 1973 a chair of clinical neurophysiology was created for him, a tenure he held until his retirement in 1984.

His major interests involved research of electroencephalography and brain functionality in epilepsy. In 1957 he described the 
hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy(HHE) syndrome, in 1961 and 1966 the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and in 1981 and 1982 the late variant of the benign childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms.

After the Second World War he was influential in reactivating the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). After serving as 
president elect from 1953 to 1957, he was secretary general from 1957 to 1969 of the ILAE, before being elected as its president from 1969 to 1973 and being past president from 1973 to 1977. In addition he was Chairman of the Commission on Terminology of the ILAE in 1963 which resulted in the publication of a Dictionary of Epilepsy.

He attempted to understand possible ties between epilepsy and artistic genius in individuals such as Fedor Dostoyevski, Gustave Flaubert, and Vincent van Gogh, and published a number of papers about this relationship.

In 1967 he was elected dean of the University of Marseille School of Medicine.

== Awards ==

Among others, Gastaut was awarded as &quot;Ambassador for Epilepsy&quot; by the ILAE and International Bureau for Epilepsy in 1968 and with the Lennox Award of the American Epilepsy Society (AES) in 1977.

<text>Trinity Buoy Wharf is the site of a lighthouse, by the confluence of the River Thames and Bow Creek on the Leamouth Peninsula, Poplar. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The lighthouse no longer functions, but is the home of various art projects such as &quot;Longplayer&quot;. It is sometimes known as Bow Creek Lighthouse.

==History==
In 1803, the site began to be used by the Elder Brethren of Trinity House, now known as Corporation of Trinity House. The seawall was reconstructed in 1822 by George Mundy of Old Ford. The site was used as a maintenance depot, and storage facility for the many buoys that aided navigation on the Thames; and the wharf for docking and repair of lightships.

The original lighthouse was built by the engineer of Trinity House, James Walker, in 1852, and was demolished in the late 1920s. A second lighthouse, which survives, was built in 1864–66 by James Douglass for Trinity House. The lantern at the top of the tower came from the Paris Exposition of 1867, where Trinity House had used it to demonstrate Professor Holmes&#x27;s improved system of electric lighting for lighthouses. Initially it housed (&#x27;for experimental purposes&#x27;) the optical equipment which had been shown at the Exposition. Michael Faraday carried out experiments there. It was later used to test lighting systems for Trinity House&#x27;s lights around England and Wales. Both lighthouses were also used for training prospective lighthouse keepers.

==Late 20th century and on==
In December 1988, Trinity House closed the wharf, and the area was acquired by the London Docklands Development Corporation. In 1998, the LDDC set up the Trinity Buoy Wharf Trust with a 125-year lease to hold the land for the people of London. Urban Space Holdings Ltd took control of the site on a long lease. The site has been, and continues to be, developed as &quot;a centre for the arts and cultural activities&quot;. Enhancements include studio space (including unusual architecture based on used shipping containers) and exhibition space.

Urban Space Holdings used the area to develop &quot;Container City&quot; in 2001, a studio and office complex made from recycled sea shipping containers. The original project was made from 80% recycled material. &quot;Container City 1&quot; took 5 months to complete, taking 4 days to install. The Container City project proved very popular and in 2002 &quot;Container City 2&quot; was completed delivering a further 22 studios across 5 floors in with a brightly coloured ziggurat design. A further extension to the Container City Complex was the &quot;Riverside Building&quot; located next to the Thames facing The O2 dome. This was yet another architectural design providing an additional 22 studio spaces.

In November 2005, the University of East London opened Fine Art studios at the wharf; and in September 2009 the university opened two dance studios at the Institute of Performing Arts Development in The Chainstore at the wharf.

Faraday School, a not-for-profit primary school run by the New Model School Company Limited, opened in September 2009.

The wharf is also the home of Thames Clippers who have offices and base all their boats on the pier there.

In April 2013 the former Cory Environmental Thames Lighterage tug &quot;Swiftstone&quot; moved to Trinity Buoy Wharf from Greenwich, and Swiftstone Trust&#x27;s volunteers began a full restoration of the vessel which can be seen underway at the year Thames Barge Driving event. In 2016 Trinity Buoy Wharf Trust acquired two historic tugboats, the &quot;Knocker White&quot; and the &quot;Varlet&quot; from the Museum of London Docklands. Both vessels are listed by National Historic Ships on the National Register of Historic Vessels.

<text>The IBM 716 line printer was used with IBM 700/7000 series computers in the 1950s and 1960s. It was introduced on May 21, 1952 with the IBM 701 and withdrawn from marketing on July 14, 1969.

==Overview==
The 716 was based on IBM 407 accounting machine technology and had 120 rotary type wheels, each with 48 possible characters. It could print 150 lines per minute. It also supplied power to the IBM 711 card reader and 721 card punch. Only 72 characters could be transferred from IBM 7090 computer to the 716 in a single operation, but a full line could be printed at half speed. Characters were printed by sending bit patterns that corresponded to the impulses that a 407 would see when reading a punched card.

A variant of the 716, the IBM 717 was used with the IBM 702 and IBM 705 computers.

<text>Rheinmetall AG is a German automotive and arms manufacturer, headquartered in Düsseldorf, Germany. The Group was promoted to the DAX, Germany&#x27;s leading share index, in March 2023. It is the largest German and fifth largest European arms manufacturer, and produces a variety of armored fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers, in both wheeled and tracked versions. Its name is derived from the German-language words &quot;Rhein&quot; and &quot;Metall&quot;, translating to &quot;Rhinemetal&quot; when combined.

==History==

=== Founding and early growth ===
In April 1889, the Hörder Bergwerks- und Hütten-Verein founded the Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik Aktiengesellschaft under General Director Josef Massenez, to produce ammunition for the German Empire. The Thuringian engineer Heinrich Ehrhardt (1840-1928) oversaw the construction of the Rheinmetall plant in Düsseldorf and managed it until 1920. He made many of his patents and inventions available to the company and contributed significantly to the technical development of many Rheinmetall products. In December 1889, the newly founded factory in Düsseldorf-Derendorf on Ulmenstraße began production.

The company expanded very quickly in the following years, partly due to government orders and partly because patents were obtained for two processes for manufacturing seamless tubes in 1891 and 1892. In order to meet the increased demand for steel resulting from the expansion of the main plant, Metallwerk Ehrhardt &amp; Heye AG in Düsseldorf-Rath was acquired in 1892 and incorporated into the company in 1896. 

In 1896, Rheinmetall presented the world&#x27;s first rapid-fire gun suitable for field service, with variable recoil and combined barrel recoil and a forward feed device. It was based on patents by the engineer Konrad Haußner. The Prussian artillery testing commission rejected it, either misjudging or not realising the possibilities. After the successful introduction of recoil-operated guns by France (Canon de 75 mle 1897), this attitude changed and the development became a great economic success for Rheinmetall. In 1901, on the initiative of Heinrich Ehrhardt, Rheinmetall took over the bankrupt Munitions- und Waffenfabrik AG in Sömmerda, expanding its product range.

=== World War I and the interwar period ===
In the following years, Rheinmetall also grew due to orders from abroad. In 1906, the factory in Düsseldorf was expanded. At the beginning of the First World War in 1914, Rheinmetall was one of the largest armaments manufacturers in the German Empire, and employed almost 8,000 people. By the end of the war, the workforce had increased to almost 48,000 workers and employees, including around 9,000 women.The built-up area at the main plant quadrupled during this time.

After the war, the armaments production came to a standstill and Rheinmetall had to lay off employees. The provisions of the Treaty of Versailles made it necessary to switch to civilian products. Rheinmetall therefore produced locomotives, railway carriages, agricultural machinery and steam ploughs in the Rhineland. The factory in Sömmerda produced precision mechanical devices such as typewriters and calculating machines. Steel production in Rath was increased to ensure the production of civilian goods. 

From 1921, Allied regulations once again permitted the production of weapons systems in small quantities. The plant in Düsseldorf-Derendorf was occupied by Belgian and French troops in 1921, during the Allied occupation of the Rhineland, and from 1923 to 1925 during the occupation of the Ruhr, and was partially devastated. Due to a lack of orders, civilian production had to be discontinued except for the manufacture of steam ploughs. In 1925, the state holding company VIAG of the German Reich bought a majority stake in Rheinmetall, as part of a capital increase. 

In April 1933, Rheinmetall bought the locomotive manufacturer Borsig, which was about to be liquidated, and thus came into possession of a large factory in Berlin-Tegel. This led to Rheinmetall being renamed Rheinmetall-Borsig AG in 1936. As part of the rearmament of the Wehrmacht, Rheinmetall increasingly developed and produced weapons and ammunition on behalf of the Reich Ministry of War from the mid-1930s onward. The products ranged from machine guns and cannons, anti-tank guns, mine launchers and field guns to anti-aircraft guns and railway guns. In 1937, the subsidiary Alkett (Altmärkische Kettenwerke) was founded in Berlin for the development and construction of armoured tracked vehicles. From 1937 onward, it was the second largest German armaments company. In 1938, the company moved its headquarters from Düsseldorf to Berlin.

=== World War II ===
During the Second World War, armaments production was increased to the maximum and the development of new weapons systems was demanded. State influence through Wehrmacht institutions and the integration of Rheinmetall-Borsig into the state-owned company Reichswerke Hermann Göring increased to such an extent that the company came under complete state control and was integrated into the planned war preparations. In the last two years of the war, the production facilities were severely damaged or destroyed by Allied air raids.

After a heavy air raid on the factories in Düsseldorf, numerous production areas were relocated east to areas of the later GDR, such as Apolda and present-day Poland, such as Guben and Breslau. During the war, the number of employees grew to 85,000. By the end of the war, most of the Rheinmetall-Borsig plants had been destroyed. The plants in Düsseldorf, West Berlin and Unterlüß came under the control of the Western Allies, and under trusteeship. All properties in the territories occupied by the Red Army were expropriated. Some factories were completely dismantled by the victorious powers.

During the Second World War, numerous forced labourers worked in the Rheinmetall factories. In the Unterlüß plant alone, around 5,000 foreign forced labourers and prisoners of war, approximately 2,500 Poles, 1,000 from the USSR, 500 Yugoslavs, 1,000 from other countries, were liberated by British troops at the end of the war. Between 1944 and 1945, Rheinmetall-Borsig took over the sponsorship of the nursery for foreign children in Unterlüß, which was also a maternity home for forced labourers and a killing centre for their children. At times, Hungarian Jewish women from a subcamp of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp were deployed in Unterlüß.

=== Division ===
The Düsseldorf plant was not fully destroyed after the Second World War. Almost the entire workforce was made redundant on 30 June 1945. A small number of employees and workers apparently remained in service, carrying out clean-up work and small-scale civilian production. The Rheinmetall sites were hardly affected by dismantling.

==== German Democratic Republic (&quot;East Germany&quot;) ====
In the GDR, state-owned spinoffs of Rheinmetall manufactured office machines, moped engines, cameras, and later printers and personal computers.

==== Federal Republic of Germany (&quot;West Germany&quot;) ====
Production was completely banned until 1950. Rheinmetall-Borsig was then transformed into a pure holding company owned by the Federal Republic of Germany. Two independent subsidiaries were founded. Borsig in Berlin produced steam boilers and refrigeration systems. Rheinmetall in Düsseldorf built typewriters, shock absorbers, lifts, tanning machines and transport and loading equipment. At the same time, preparations were made for the resumption of armaments production as early as 1950. In 1954, the first enquiries from German and Swiss former armaments manufacturers to the federal government, who wanted to buy the company, can be documented.

An upturn came in 1956, when the 56 per cent majority share in Rheinmetall-Borsig, which was owned by the Federal Republic of Germany, was taken over by Röchlingsche Eisen- und Stahlwerke GmbH. In August, Borsig was sold to Salzgitter AG. The holding company was renamed Rheinmetall Berlin AG in November. The subsidiary in Düsseldorf was renamed Rheinmetall GmbH in 1957. 

A new defence technology production programme was launched in 1956, with the establishment of the Bundeswehr. Rheinmetall produced machine guns, automatic cannons and ammunition. The first product was the MG3. In 1960, the workforce had grown to 3,080 employees. In 1964, production of heavy weapons resumed, such as gun barrels and mounts. Rheinmetall began equipping tanks and artillery pieces. Rheinmetall developed a tank destroyer cannon, a standard armoured turret and a tank howitzer. In 1965, the development of 120-millimetre smoothbore technology began under the leadership of Raimund Germershausen.

Parallel to the increasing sales success and organic growth, Rheinmetall acquired around a dozen smaller mechanical engineering companies between 1958 and 1973, primarily those active in the fields of packaging and forming technology and electronics. 1974/75 saw the first acquisitions of foreign companies in Portugal, Great Britain and the Netherlands. In 1978, production of the 155 mm FH70 field howitzer began. In October 1979, the first Leopard 2 main battle tank was delivered to the Bundeswehr. It was equipped with the 120-millimetre smoothbore gun developed by Rheinmetall.

In the following years, the company&#x27;s civilian division was reorganised and strengthened in 1981 with the purchasing of multiple companies. In 1999, Rheinmetall sold off its packaging technology division to IWKA AG. In 1986, the Automotive Technology division was established through the acquisition of carburettor manufacturer Pierburg GmbH. Together with Diehl Munitionssysteme, Rheinmetall founded the Gesellschaft für Intelligente Wirksysteme (GIWS). GIWS specialised in intelligent ammunition, projectiles and other defence technology systems. In 1989, due to the changed global political situation, Rheinmetall adapted its corporate strategy by diversifying into civilian industrial products.

=== 1990s ===
By acquiring a 100 per cent stake in MaK System Gesellschaft, part of Friedrich Krupp AG, between 1990 and 1992, Rheinmetall expanded its expertise in the field of new systems for land forces and special vehicles. For example, for use in environmental protection. In the same year, Rheinmetall delivered the first Wiesel armoured weapon carrier to the German armed forces. The company strengthened its involvement in the field of ammunition production by acquiring a stake in WNC-Nitrochemie GmbH in Aschau am Inn. 

In 1993, Rheinmetall expanded its civilian product range by acquiring Mauser Waldeck AG to build up the Office Systems division, taking over Heimann Systems GmbH to strengthen the Security Technology division and acquiring a majority stake in Preh-Werke to expand the Automotive Technology division. In 1995, Rheinmetall expanded its expertise in medium-calibre automatic cannon systems, by acquiring a majority stake in Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH and increasing Pierburg&#x27;s involvement in the USA. In the same year, Rheinmetall acquired a stake in STN Atlas Elektronik in order to strengthen its expertise in defence electronics.

In 1997, Rheinmetall underwent a fundamental reorganisation, in the form of mergers and new acquisitions.

In 1998, the first unit of the new gun artillery system Panzerhaubitze 2000, developed by Rheinmetall and MaK Systemgesellschaft, was handed over to the Bundeswehr, and the Rhino minesweeper from MaK Systemgesellschaft was deployed in the former Yugoslavia. Rheinmetall took over the defence technology of BUCK System GmbH and formed BUCK Neue Technologien. In 1999, Rheinmetall acquired a majority stake in Oerlikon Contraves, a supplier of combined cannon and guided missile systems for air defence, and Eurometaal Holding N.V., a manufacturer of medium calibre artillery. In late 1999, Rheinmetall took over the companies KUKA Wehrtechnik and Henschel Wehrtechnik, and later combined the two with MaK Systemgesellschaft, to form the new company, Rheinmetall Landsysteme.

=== 2000 and onward ===
In 2000, Rheinmetall&#x27;s Executive Board decided to concentrate on defence technology, automotive technology and electronics. Subsequently, it sold off multiple subsidiaries. In 2004, the focus on the defence technology divisions was largely completed .

In 2003, Rheinmetall Landsysteme delivered the first new Marder 1A5 mine-protected infantry fighting vehicle. To develop the new Puma infantry fighting vehicle for the Bundeswehr, Rheinmetall Landsysteme and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann set up the joint venture PSM GmbH, in which both companies hold a 50 per cent stake.

In the Defence Technology division, Rheinmetall W&amp;M GmbH was merged with Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH, Buck Neue Technologien GmbH and Pyrotechnik Silberhütte GmbH to form the new Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH. Rheinmetall cooperated with Rafael Ltd. and Diehl Munitionssysteme GmbH for missile manufacturing contracts. In 2005, Rheinmetall Landsysteme became a co-partner in the newly founded Heeresinstandsetzungslogistik (HIL). The company is responsible for the maintenance of selected vehicles and weapon systems of the German Army. The Public Security business unit was established in response to the changing threat situation, and to offer systems for defence against threats to internal security and civil protection.

In March 2008, Rheinmetall acquired the armour manufacturer Stork PWV from the Dutch conglomerate Stork, thereby taking over a share of the production of Boxer tanks, which were developed for the Bundeswehr and the Dutch army. In May 2010, Rheinmetall and MAN founded the joint company Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV). This created a full-range supplier in the market for wheeled military vehicles, covering the complete range of protected and unprotected transport, command and functional vehicles for international armed forces. Rheinmetall holds a 51 per cent stake in the company and MAN 49 per cent. Between 2010 and 2011, Rheinmetall acquired the German activities of Verseidag Ballistic Protection. In February 2011, Rheinmetall increased its stake in ADS Gesellschaft für aktive Schutzsysteme.

In July 2011, Rheinmetall reviewed the sustainability of the company&#x27;s two-pillar strategy, with the two divisions Automotive Technology and Defence. Both divisions were to be enabled to further develop their competitive positions with greater flexibility. In this context, Rheinmetall examined in particular the possibility of an IPO for Kolbenschmidt Pierburg (KSPG), which represents the automotive sector of the Rheinmetall Group; this possibility ended in 2012. That year, KSPG took over the plain bearing activities of Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd (KOEL) in Pune, India. KOEL is, among other things, the largest plain bearing manufacturer in India, and is primarily focussed on the domestic market there.

In January 2012, Rheinmetall and Cassidian combined their activities in the field of unmanned aerial systems and cargo loading systems in a joint venture. Cassidian holds 51 percent and Rheinmetall 49 percent of the shares in the newly founded Rheinmetall Airborne Systems GmbH.

In May 2012, the automotive sector streamlined its organizational structure. KSPG&#x27;s previous six business units were bundled into three divisions: Hardparts, Mechatronics and Motorservice.

=== After the Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
In the wake of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave the Zeitenwende speech during a special session of the Bundestag in February. The associated change in German foreign and security policy included a special fund for the Bundeswehr, amounting to 100 billion euros. Rheinmetall Group CEO Armin Papperger expressed the expectation that Rheinmetall would benefit from this on a large scale by placed orders. In June 2022, Rheinmetall presented its latest KF51 Panther main battle tank at the Eurosatory arms fair. 

In November 2022, Rheinmetall announced the purchase of Spanish ammunition manufacturer Expal, which was completed in August 2023 for 1.2 billion euros. Rheinmetall expected an increase in demand for ammunition following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and, in this context, an improvement in the supply capability of ammunition for the Gepard anti-aircraft gun tank. In December 2022, Rheinmetall increased production of ammunition in Germany, in connection with the war in Ukraine and a Swiss veto on ammunition deliveries.

Rheinmetall announced that it was building a new production facility for 20-35 millimeter calibre ammunition. In July 2023, the plant started production. In September, it was announced that Hungary would be the first country to complete development of its version of the KF 51 tank, and locally produce it. 

In October 2023, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal presented Chancellor Scholz with the certificate of registration of the joint venture Rheinmetall Ukrainien Defence Industry LLC, based in Kyiv, which began operations in the same month. It was announced in December 2023 that Rheinmetall planned to produce the Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle and the TPz Fuchs Armored Personnel Carrier in Ukraine. Rheinmetall intends to have the first units come off the production line sometime in 2024. 

An additional 200,000 artillery shells are to be manufactured at a new plant in Unterlüß from 2025.

In 2024, Rheinmetall signed a deal with Lithuania to build a 155 mm artillery ammuntion plant. The company will invest around €180m and the plant will be jointly owned by Rheinmetall and the Lithuanian government. The plant is being built in Baisogala and will become operational in mid-2026.

US intelligence services claim to have foiled a Russian plot to assassinate Armin Papperger (CEO and chairman of the executive board).&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/russian-plot-kill-boss&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/2024/07/11/Exclusive&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions ==
With its Vehicle Systems divisions, Europe and International, Rheinmetall is primarily active in the field of wheeled and tracked military vehicles.

== Corruption charges ==
In 2012, Rheinmetall Air Defence (RAD), a division of Rheinmetall, was one of six companies that were blacklisted by India&#x27;s Ministry of Defence for their involvement in a bribery scandal. The companies were accused of bribing the Director General of Ordnance Factories Board (OFB), Sudipta Ghosh. RAD and the other firms were barred from any dealings with the OFB and all other Indian defence companies, as well as being blacklisted from participating in any Indian defence contract, for a period of 10 years. RAD claimed that the charges against it are without merit.

In 2012, Rheinmetall Air Defence was implicated in a corruption case in India, along with arms dealer Abhishek Verma and his wife Anca Verma, as lodged by the anti-corruption agency of India, the CBI, for bribing defence officials for securing multi billion dollar weapons contracts of the Indian military establishment. In 2014, RAD Chairman Bodo Garbe and General Manager Gerhard Hoy were issued summons of the Indian courts. Subsequently a red-corner notice was issued for their detention through Interpol. In 2016, the case was under trial in Indian courts.

== Criticism ==
In 2024 Investigate Europe criticized that Rheinmetal has a parallel business that sells machinery and factories free from German export rules.

<text>Orchard House Yard (known as Orchard Yard and Hercules Wharf) was an English shipbuilding yard located at Leamouth, on the River Lea at Bow Creek . Forming part of the Orchard House estate, a number of shipbuilders occupied the site over time:

* 1840 Ditchburn &amp; Mare
* 1846 C J Mare &amp; Co
* 1857 Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company Ltd
* 1873(pre) Joseph Spencer Watson
* 1889 W J Jolly
* 1890 H H Mackenzie/Mackenzie, MacAlpine &amp; Co.

The only known surviving vessel built at the yard is SS &quot;Robin&quot;, a 300-ton steam-powered coaster which is part of the National Historic Fleet and the last of her type still in existence. She was built at Orchard House Yard in 1890 by Mackenzie and is currently located a short distance away in the Royal Victoria Dock.

<text>SS &quot;Robin&quot; is a 350 gross registered ton (GRT) steam coaster, a class of steamship designed for carrying bulk and general cargoes in coastal waters, and the oldest complete example in the world. One of a pair of coasters built in Bow Creek, London in 1890, the ship was built for British owners, but spent most of her long working life on the Spanish coast as &quot;Maria&quot;.

In 1974, she was purchased for restoration as &quot;Robin&quot; and is listed by National Historic Ships as part of the National Historic Fleet (the nautical equivalent of a Grade 1 Listed Building). She is situated at Trinity Buoy Wharf in east London, opening as the SS &quot;Robin&quot; museum, theatre and educational centre in 2014.

==Specification==
As built, &quot;Robin&quot; was long, her beam is , her depth is and her tonnage is . She carried about 450 tons of cargo.

The engine is a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine, developing , and made in 1890 by Gourlay Brothers &amp; Co of Dundee, Scotland. Her maximum speed was .

In Lloyd&#x27;s Register she was described as a &quot;steel screw 3-masted schooner&quot;, and had indeed been provided with sails for all three masts when first built.

==History==

&quot;Robin&quot; was ordered from Mackenzie, MacAlpine &amp; Co of Orchard House Yard, Hercules Wharf, Blackwall, London, situated in Bow Creek at the mouth of the River Lea, by London shipowner Robert Thomson, and launched on 16 September 1890. However, she and her sister &quot;Rook&quot; were completed by Thomson himself, though the reason is unknown. After fitting out in the East India Dock, &quot;Robin&quot; was towed to Dundee to have her engine, boiler and auxiliary machinery installed by Gourlay Brothers &amp; Co. When completed she was registered in London with Official number 98185 and in the ownership of Arthur Ponsonby of Newport, then in Monmouthshire.

===1890 to 1900===

On 20 December 1890, &quot;Robin&quot; commenced her career in the British coastal service at Liverpool, with a crew of 12 signing the Articles for her maiden voyage. As a coaster her range was normally limited to the Home Trade limits (broadly from the Elbe to Brest). However, on her first voyage she went further, to Bayonne; the owners had to replace the Master&#x27;s mate with another, who held the correct certificate, until the ship returned to Swansea on 10 January. Her second voyage began at Swansea on 14 January 1891, visiting Rouen, Northfleet on the River Thames, Eastham and Garston on the River Mersey, Plymouth, Deauville, Guernsey, London, Rochester, Newport, Swansea, Cherbourg arriving in Northfleet by 5 April 1891. This would be typical of her trading under the Red Ensign, carrying bulk cargoes of grain, iron ore, scrap steel, pit props, china clay, railway steel, general cargoes of casked and baled goods such as herring barrels, and even granite blocks for the Caledonian Canal. In 1892, &quot;Robin&quot; was sold to Andrew Forrester Blackater of Glasgow, where she was re-registered.

===1900 to 1974===
In 1900 &quot;Robin&quot; was sold and renamed &quot;Maria&quot;; for the next 74 years she had three different Spanish owners:

* 1900–1913 Blanco Hermanos y Compañia of Ribadesella.
* 1913–1965 Hijos de Angel Perez y Compañia of Santander. During World War I she carried iron slabs for the French government from the foundry at Santiago to Bayonne and Bordeaux, escorted by two destroyers to protect her from German U-boats. From 1935 to 1939 (the Spanish Civil War) the ship was laid up at San Esteban de Pravia.
* 1965–1974 Eduardo de la Sota Poveda of Bilbao, working around Bilbao and the north coast of Spain until 1974, carrying coal for the bunkering of liners.

Until 1965, &quot;Maria&quot;″s structure stayed mainly unchanged; in 1966 she had a major refit with the whaleback (at the stern) and the mizzen mast removed, the foremast and the funnel shortened, and the forecastle extended. The coal-fired furnaces were modified for oil fuel. After this she resumed trading.

===1974 to 2002===

&quot;Maria&quot; was discovered by the Maritime Trust in 1972. Following an inspection, it was decided that she was worth preserving, and in May 1974 she was purchased, on the brink of being sold to Spanish breakers. In June 1974 she came home to St Katharine Docks under her own steam and was renamed &quot;Robin&quot;. She was restored at a cost of £250,000, with most work taking place in 1974 and 1975 at the Doust &amp; Co shipyard at Rochester, Kent, and was subsequently moored in St Katharine Docks. She was moved to new moorings in 1991 at West India Quay but fell into disrepair.

In 2000 David and Nishani Kampfner were looking for a unique space to be transformed into an area for innovation and learning. They bought &quot;Robin&quot; for £1. In 2002, SS Robin Trust was created to bring awareness to the general public about the importance of the ship. With the help of many volunteers they began restoration on this coastal steamer.

===2002 to 2008===
Crossrail provided SS Robin Trust with a £1.9 million loan to enable her to move to dry dock for restoration works to commence. Before she was able to be moved, her masts, funnel, lifeboats and davits were dismantled and removed by Cutty Sark Enterprises. She was then towed from West India Quay down the Canary Wharf locks to South Quay for temporary mooring. Around this time the Heritage Lottery Fund had also been approved and SS Robin Trust was awarded a grant of just under £1 million.

===2008 to 2010===
In June 2008, &quot;Robin&quot; was to undergo her first seaward journey in 35 years from South Quay to Lowestoft for structural restoration using, so far as was practicable, the same craft skills with which she was built in 1890, conserving her Victorian technology. Once at Lowestoft a detailed examination revealed that after 118 years she was now considered too fragile to be able to float again. Initially it was thought that &quot;Robin&quot; would need a 40% steel replacement, but after the examination it showed that she would need an 80% steel replacement thereby essentially ruining her historical value. These new findings urged SS Robin Trust to find a less destructive approach maintaining &quot;Robin&quot;. It soon became clear that a pontoon would be the most innovative and least destructive method to keep her floating and to preserve and display her original riveted fabric. It also provided a wealth of more space. In 2010, &quot;Robin&quot; was lifted by two cranes and placed onto her new pontoon. She was then towed to Tilbury where she was moored for a year.

===2010 to present===

After 3 years of conservation work in Tilbury, in July 2011 &quot;Robin&quot; returned to east London, where she was originally built, to undergo further internal restoration and preparation before opening as the SS Robin museum, theatre and educational centre in the Royal Victoria Dock in Newham borough in 2014, with the support of a grant of just over £950,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

She was then subsequently moved to the Millennium Mills Dock, where she was temporarily berthed for further restoration and development before reopening to the public, at the western end of the Royal Victoria Dock (close to the London Cable Car), in 2015.

In 2023, she was moved to Trinity Buoy Wharf.

==Arts &amp; Education Centre and Museum==
In 2002, David and Nishani Kampfner bought &quot;Robin&quot; and founded the SS Robin Trust as a registered charity (Prince Philip is an honorary member, and Jim Fitzpatrick MP, and Channel 4 news reader Jon Snow are patrons). The Trust converted her into an educational centre and photographic gallery; in this restoration, the original beams, structures, fittings and engine were preserved and restored by her volunteer crew. She operated as a learning centre and photojournalism gallery from 2003, with an extensive programme of exhibitions, talks, seminars and workshops designed to build bridges between communities and interacting with local schools and businesses. The gallery, with a flexible classroom and exhibition area, was accommodated within the original cargo hold.

<text>Jayanth Jambulingam Chandrasekhar (born April 9, 1968) is an American comedian, film director, screenwriter, actor and editor. He is best known for his work with the sketch comedy group Broken Lizard and for directing and starring in the Broken Lizard films &quot;Super Troopers&quot;, &quot;Club Dread&quot;, &quot;Beerfest&quot; and &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot;. Since 2001, he has also worked frequently as a television director on many episodes of &quot;Community&quot; and &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, among dozens of comedy series. He has also occasionally worked as a film director outside of Broken Lizard projects, most notably on the 2005 film &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Chandrasekhar was born in Chicago to parents who lived in the adjacent suburb of Oak Park, Illinois. Both his father, Arcot Jambulingam &quot;AJ&quot; Chandrasekhar, and his mother, Hema Chandrasekhar, are physicians of Tamil origin and are originally from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The hospital where he was born, old Cook County Hospital, was where his parents worked. Chandrasekhar has an older sister as well as a younger sister named Sandhya Chandrasekhar, who are both lawyers.

Chandrasekhar lived in Oak Park until his family moved farther west from Chicago to the suburb of Hinsdale. He graduated from the boarding high school Lake Forest Academy. He graduated from Colgate University with a major in European history and a minor in philosophy. During college he spent a semester at Chicago&#x27;s Loyola University.

== Career ==

=== Broken Lizard comedy troupe ===
Chandrasekhar formed Broken Lizard with former members of comedy troupe Charred Goosebeak and Beta Theta Pi, people he met during college at Colgate University. Chandrasekhar said he found his path to comedy after acting in high school and college. He did some open mic standup comedy work in Chicago and founded a sketch group called &quot;Charred Goose Beak&quot; at college. After moving to New York, the group was renamed Broken Lizard.

Chandrasekhar began making shorts featuring the troupe, then made the self-funded movie &quot;Puddle Cruiser&quot; in 1996. The film made it into the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. Then in 2001, they made &quot;Super Troopers&quot; as an independent movie, which Harvey Weinstein helped to develop at Miramax Films, but did not end up distributing.

=== Directing ===
In 2005, Chandrasekhar directed &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. The action comedy film based on the 1970s American television series of the same name was the debut of pop singer Jessica Simpson as an actress. While financially successful, the film was met with negative reviews from critics. He has become an established television comedy director, directing episodes of &quot;Undeclared,&quot; &quot;Happy Endings,&quot; &quot;Chuck,&quot; &quot;Community,&quot; &quot;Psych,&quot; &quot;New Girl&quot;, and &quot;Arrested Development.&quot; He says that the earlier a director joins a show, the more impact he or she will have on its look and feel.

In 2012, Chandrasekhar made the movie &quot;The Babymakers.&quot; He directed several episodes of &quot;Blue Mountain State&quot;. Amazon released a pilot in the 2014 Amazon Original Series that he wrote and directed called &quot;Really&quot;.

Between 2014 and 2018, he directed 16 episodes of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;.

In June 2018, the filmmaker revealed that he is in discussions with Marvel Studios to direct one of their upcoming movies.

In February 2021, Chandrasekhar was announced as the director of the family comedy &quot;Easter Sunday&quot;, starring Jo Koy.

=== Acting ===
Chandrasekhar guest starred alongside his cousin Sendhil Ramamurthy in a 2009 episode of &quot;Psych&quot;, which Chandrasekhar also directed. He appeared as the cab driver in the &quot;Terror Taxi&quot; skit from &quot;&quot;. He appeared as racist comedian Gupta Gupti Gupta in the episode &quot;Basic Email Security&quot; of &quot;Community&quot;, which Chandrasekhar also directed.

=== Stand-up ===
Chandrasekhar often does stand-up comedy, sometimes touring with fellow Broken Lizard friends, Steve Lemme and Kevin Heffernan. His stand-up is a mix of jokes and stories.

== Personal life ==
Chandrasekhar has been married to actress Susan Clarke since 2005. They have twin daughters and a son. Chandrasekhar&#x27;s middle name, Jambulingam, is in honor of his grandfather, and is also his son&#x27;s middle name. He used the name Jumbulingam for his editorial credits.

Chandrasekhar&#x27;s cousin is the actor Sendhil Ramamurthy, who played the role of Mohinder Suresh in the NBC superhero drama &quot;Heroes&quot; and also appeared in the Broken Lizard film &quot;The Slammin&#x27; Salmon.&quot; His mother-in-law is Mary Pat Clarke, the first woman to serve as president of the Baltimore City Council.

<text>Sister Act is a 1992 American musical crime comedy film directed by Emile Ardolino and written by Paul Rudnick (billed as Joseph Howard). It stars Whoopi Goldberg as a lounge singer forced to hide in a convent after being placed in a witness protection program. It also features Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Mary Wickes, and Harvey Keitel.

&quot;Sister Act&quot; was one of the most financially successful comedies of the early 1990s, grossing $231 million worldwide against a $31 million budget. Its success extended to the home video market, and it was the most rented film of 1993 in the United States. The film spawned a franchise, which consists of the 1993 sequel &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; and a musical adaptation, which premiered in 2006. A third film is in development for Disney+.

==Plot==
In 1968, Deloris Wilson is a young Catholic school student, who does not take her studies seriously and greatly embarrasses her nun teachers while showing an affinity for music.

Twenty-four years later, in 1992, Deloris is a lounge singer in Reno, Nevada, performing as Deloris Van Cartier, in a club owned by her married gangster boyfriend Vince LaRocca. She then receives a shallow gift from Vince, and attempts to return it, only to witness Vince executing an informant. When he sets out to murder her as well, Deloris goes to the police for further assistance. Police lieutenant Eddie Souther places her in witness protection, and brings her to Saint Katherine&#x27;s Parish, in a run-down neighborhood in San Francisco, for her to hide out in their struggling convent.

Both Deloris, and the disgruntled head nun of St. Katherine&#x27;s, Reverend Mother, object to this arrangement, but Lt. Souther, and Monsignor O&#x27;Hara, the parish priest, convince them to go along with it, with the added deal that the police will pay the failing convent a good sum of money. Disguised as &quot;Sister Mary Clarence&quot;, Deloris initially has difficulty dealing with the rigid and simple convent life, and butts heads with Reverend Mother, but she befriends the other nuns, including the optimistic and upbeat Sister Mary Patrick, the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus, and the shy, young Novice Sister Mary Robert. One night, after a poorly attended Sunday Mass—with a lackluster performance from the convent choir led by Mary Lazarus—Deloris decides she needs a break, and she sneaks out to a bar, followed by Mary Patrick and Mary Robert. They are caught by the Reverend Mother, who considers kicking Deloris out, but instead, orders Deloris to join the struggling choir. With her singing experience, Deloris is elected to take over as their director and transforms the choir.

At the next Sunday Mass, Deloris leads the much-improved choir in a traditional hymn of &quot;Hail Holy Queen&quot;, then shifts into a combined gospel and rock and roll interpretation. Although Reverend Mother is infuriated, Monsignor O&#x27;Hara congratulates the choir for their unorthodox performance as new people were attracted to the service. Convinced by Deloris, he allows the nuns to clean the church and the neighborhood. Their singing and efforts to revitalize the neighborhood attract media attention, and the parish thrives.

Souther chastises Deloris for nearly being exposed on national television as Vince has placed a bounty on her head. She assures him she will try to keep a lower profile, and Souther attends a Mass. The nun&#x27;s choir continues to amaze parishioners and visitors, especially with a rendition of &quot;My Guy&quot; – rewritten and performed as &quot;My God&quot;.

O&#x27;Hara informs the convent that Pope John Paul II, having heard of the choir&#x27;s success, will visit the church. Deloris tells Reverend Mother that Vince&#x27;s upcoming trial means she will soon leave; the Mother reveals she has resigned as abbess, believing she is no longer useful to the convent as her authority was unintentionally undermined. Deloris tries to convince her to stay and keep the parish thriving as it is, but the Mother retorts that she believes herself too old-fashioned and incapable of doing so.

Souther discovers a corrupt detective in his own department who has given Deloris&#x27;s location to Vince and rushes to San Francisco to warn her. Vince&#x27;s men kidnap her and Mary Robert, but Deloris helps Mary Robert to escape. When Mary Robert returns to the convent, Reverend Mother reveals to the nuns that Sister Mary Clarence is Deloris Van Cartier and explains why she had been hiding in their convent. They decide to rescue Deloris, requesting a helicopter pilot to fly them to Reno.

In Reno, Vince orders his men to kill Deloris, but they cannot bring themselves to shoot her while she is dressed in a nun&#x27;s habit. Arriving at Vince&#x27;s casino, the nuns find Deloris after she escapes from Vince&#x27;s men, and they try to sneak out of the casino, but they become cornered by Vince and her men, in the casino lounge. Deloris prepares to sacrifice herself, but Vince&#x27;s men still refuse to shoot her. Vince himself is hesitant, but he works up the courage to shoot her. His hesitation is just long enough for Souther to shoot Vince in the arm and arrest him and his men.

Thanking Deloris for her actions, Reverend Mother decides to remain as abbess of the convent. Returning to San Francisco, the choir, led by Deloris, sing &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot; to a packed audience in a refurbished Saint Katherine&#x27;s, receiving a standing ovation from all, including Reverend Mother, the Pope, Monsignor O&#x27;Hara, and Lt. Souther. Deloris continues to guide and coach the choir as a touring musical group. During the closing credits, the group sings a cover of the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Shout&quot;.

==Cast==
;Choir nuns
==Production==

Screenwriter Paul Rudnick pitched &quot;Sister Act&quot; to producer Scott Rudin in 1987, with Bette Midler in mind for the lead role. The script was brought to Disney. However, Midler turned down the role, fearing that her fans would not want to see her play a nun. Eventually, Whoopi Goldberg signed on to play the lead. As production commenced, the script was rewritten by a half dozen screenwriters, including Carrie Fisher, Robert Harling, and Nancy Meyers. With the movie no longer resembling his original script, Rudnick asked to be credited with a pseudonym in the film, deciding on Joseph Howard.

The church in which Deloris takes sanctuary is St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church, located at Valley and Church Streets in Noe Valley, an upper-middle-class neighborhood of San Francisco. The storefronts on the opposite side of the street were redressed to give the appearance of a run-down neighborhood. Filming took place from to .

Though the order of the nuns in the film is said to be a Carmelite one by Sister Mary Patrick, their religious habit is similar in appearance to that of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis (minus the cross). Members of the real-life Order, however, no longer wear their traditional habit.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on June 9, 1992, in conjunction with the film, and contained the musical numbers performed by actors in the film itself, pre-recorded songs that were used as part of the background music, and instrumental music composed by Marc Shaiman for the film. The soundtrack album debuted at #74 and eventually reached #40 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart where it charted for 54 weeks. The album received a Gold certification from the RIAA for shipment of 500,000 copies on January 13, 1993. The album was certified platinum in Australia.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received a generally positive reception from critics, holding a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Looking for a sweet musical comedy about a witness to a crime hiding out from killers in a convent? There&#x27;s nun better than &quot;Sister Act&quot;.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars out of a possible 4. He wrote that Goldberg and Wickes both offered humorous performances, but the film overall &quot;plays like a missed opportunity&quot; due to slow pacing and trouble integrating the organized crime scenes into a comedy film. Metacritic gave the film a score of 51 based on the 23 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Box office===
The film was a box-office success, grossing $139.6 million in the U.S. and $92 million in other countries, effectively grossing $231.6 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1992. It sat at the #2 spot for four weeks, behind &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;, &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; in succession.

===Accolades===
The film is also recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs — Nominated

===Lawsuits===
On June 10, 1993, actress Donna Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc. filed a $200 million lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming the film was plagiarized from the book &quot;A Nun in the Closet&quot;, owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson argued that, in 1985, they had developed a screenplay for the book, which had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. The lawsuit noted over 100 similarities between the movie and the book/screenplay as evidence of plagiarism. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer in an attempt to win the case. The judge found in favor of Disney and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, &quot;They would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail.&quot;

In November 2011, a nun named Delois Blakely filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and Sony Pictures claiming that &quot;The Harlem Street Nun&quot;, an autobiography she wrote in 1987, was the basis for the 1992 film. She alleged that a movie executive expressed an interest in the movie rights after she wrote a three-page synopsis. She sued for &quot;breach of contract, misappropriation of likeness and unjust enrichment.&quot; Blakely dropped the original lawsuit in January 2012 to serve a more robust lawsuit in late August 2012 with the New York Supreme Court, asking for $1 billion in damages from Disney. In early February 2013, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, awarding no damages to Blakely.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS on November 13, 1992 by Touchstone Home Video. It proved very successful in the video rental market, and ended up as the top rental of 1993 in the United States. The Region 1 DVD was released on November 6, 2001; however, the disc has no anamorphic enhancement, similar to early DVDs from Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Special Features include the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer; music videos for &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot; by Deloris and the Sisters, and &quot;If My Sister&#x27;s in Trouble&quot; by Lady Soul, both of which contain clips from the film; and a featurette titled &quot;Inside Sister Act: The Making Of&quot;.

The all-region Blu-ray including both films was released on June 19, 2012, with both films presented in 1080p. The three-disc set also includes both films on DVD with the same bonus features as previous releases.

<text>Turda (; , ; ; ) is a city in Cluj County, Transylvania, Romania. It is located in the southeastern part of the county, from the county seat, Cluj-Napoca, to which it is connected by the European route E81, and from nearby Câmpia Turzii. 

The city consists of four neighborhoods: Turda Veche, Turda Nouă, Oprișani, and Poiana. It is traversed from west to east by the Arieș River and north to south by its tributary, Valea Racilor.

==History==

===Ancient times===

There is evidence of human settlement in the area dating to the Middle Paleolithic, some 60,000 years ago. The Dacians established a town that Ptolemy in his &quot;Geography&quot; calls &quot;Patreuissa&quot;, which is probably a corruption of &quot;Patavissa&quot; or &quot;Potaissa&quot;, the latter being more common. It was conquered by the Romans, who kept the name &quot;Potaissa&quot;, between AD 101 and 106, during the rule of Trajan, together with parts of Decebal&#x27;s Dacia.

The name Potaissa is first recorded on a Roman milliarium discovered in 1758 in the nearby Aiton commune.

The legionary fortress established as the basecamp of the Legio V &quot;Macedonica&quot; from 166 to 274 was named &quot;Potaissa&quot; too. The city became a municipium, then a colonia. 

The Potaissa salt mines were worked in the area since prehistoric times.

From the reign of Gordian III (238–244) numerous treasures were excavated from Turda, Țaga, Viișoara, and Mărtinești, showing that in this time the defense was breaking under the Carps, Goths, Gepids, and Vandals.

Objects dated to post-Aurelian retreat found at the site (for example an inscribed onyx gem depicting the Good Shepherd, and silver coins of Diocletian) together with a large burial containing sarcophagi and a cremation stone box point at continuous habitation until the early fifth century. The situation changes in the next two centuries when dwellings and cemeteries superpose the Roman site, in a similar manner to Apulum and Sirmium. After conquering the place, the Huns settled down near. From this time three solidus were found from graves. Burying with coins was a Gepid tradition not typical of the Huns, meaning that they settled their vassals in Transylvania too.

===Middle Ages===

The territory changed hands between the Gepids and Langobards multiple times before both were expelled by the Avars.

After the Hungarian conquest, the kindred Kalocsa settled here. Their center was called (&quot;castle of Torda&quot;), and another important estate was (&quot;home of Torda&quot;) as of 1075. The name probably derives from Old Bulgarian *tvьrdъ meaning citadel, fortress. 

Saxons settled in the area in the 12th century. Much of the town was destroyed during the Tatar invasion in 1241–1242, however most of its inhabitants survived by hiding in the cave system. King Stephen V ensured its quick revival by giving privileges.

On 8 January, 1288, Ladislaus IV attended the first national assembly in Torda and recruited an army of Transylvanians to repel the Cuman invasion. He pursued the Cumans back to the border. During this time the Hungarians were the absolute majority in the city. Numerous meetings were held here afterwards.

The Hungarian Diet was held here in 1467, by Matthias Corvinus. Later, in the 16th century, Turda was often the residence of the Transylvanian Diet, too. After the Battle of Mohács, the city became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and since 1570 the Principality of Transylvania. The 1558 Diet of Turda declared free practice of both the Catholic and Lutheran religions. In 1563 the Diet also accepted the Calvinist religion, and in 1568 it extended freedom to all religions, declaring that &quot;It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion&quot; – a freedom unusual in medieval Europe. This Edict of Turda is the first attempt at legislating general religious freedom in Christian Europe (though its legal effectiveness was limited).

In 1609 Gabriel Báthori granted new privileges to Turda. These were confirmed later by Gabriel Bethlen. In the battle of Turda, Ahmed Pasha defeated George II Rákóczi in 1659.

===Modern times===
In 1711 the Grand Principality of Translyvania was formed which became in 1804 part of the Austrian Empire. In 1867, by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the city became again part of Hungary. After World War I, following the proclamation of the Union of Transylvania with Romania of December 1918 and the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1918–1919, Turda passed under Romanian administration, and then became part of the Kingdom of Romania by the Treaty of Trianon of 1920. During the interwar period, the city became the seat of Turda County. In 1944, the Battle of Turda took place here, between German and Hungarian forces on one side and Soviet and Romanian forces on the other. It was the largest battle fought in Transylvania during World War II.

After 1950, the city became the headquarters of Turda raion within the Cluj Region. Following the administrative reform of 1968, it became part of Cluj County. From the late 1950s, Turda became a rather important industrial centre, housing factories for chemical, electrotechnical ceramics, cement, glass, and steel cables. The nearby Câmpia Turzii town hosted a steel plant. The city centre of Turda saw redevelopment in the late 1980s, including a House of Culture that hasn&#x27;t been finished up to this date. Many houses in the historic center were demolished to create space for apartment buildings. The town&#x27;s role of an industrial powerhouse has diminished from the 1990s onwards, but tourist attractions have kept the city in a good state up to today.

==Climate==
Turda has a continental climate, characterised by warm dry summers and cold winters. The climate is influenced by the city&#x27;s proximity to the Apuseni Mountains, as well as by urbanisation. Some West-Atlantic influences are present during winter and autumn. Winter temperatures are often below , even though they rarely drop below . On average, snow covers the ground for 65 days each winter. In July and August, the average temperature is approximately , despite the fact that temperatures sometimes reach in mid-summer in the city centre. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer is low, there are infrequent yet heavy and often violent storms. During spring and autumn, temperatures vary between , and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.

==Demographics==
According to the Hungarian census from 1910, the town had 13,455 inhabitants, of which 9,674 were Hungarians, 3,389 Romanians, and 100 Germans.

According to the 2011 Romanian census, there were 47,744 people living within the city. Of this population, 84.7% were ethnic Romanians, while 8.98% were ethnic Hungarians, 6.03% ethnic Roma, and 0.4% others.

At the 2021 census, Turda had a population of 43,319, a decrease of 9.3% from the previous census; of those, 72.46% were Romanians, 5.92% Hungarians, and 4.03% Roma.

<text>The River Medlock in Greater Manchester, England rises in east Oldham and flows south and west for to join the River Irwell in Manchester city centre.

==Sources==
Rising in the hills that surround Strinesdale just to the eastern side of Oldham MBC, the Medlock flows through the steep-sided wooded gorge that separates Lees from Ashton-under-Lyne and the Daisy Nook Country Park with its 19th century aqueduct carrying the disused Hollinwood Branch Canal over the shallow river. 

==Lower reaches==
The final miles of the river flowing to the River Irwell have been extensively modified. The river is culverted underneath the car park of the City of Manchester Stadium (the site of a former gasworks). It is visible flowing through Mayfield Park and under a bridge on Baring Street, close to Piccadilly station, before running again in a culvert beneath the former University of Manchester Institute of Science &amp; Technology campus (London Road (A6) to Princess Street), then under Hulme Street, until it appears briefly at Gloucester Street before flowing under the former gasworks at Gaythorn, reappearing at City Road East.

At the point where Deansgate and Chester Road (A56) meet (under the Bridgewater Viaduct), the river meets the Bridgewater Canal head on, where a sluice gate (a listed structure) allowed water to feed the canal, until the water quality of the Medlock became too polluted for canal use. Normally, the level of the river is several feet below the level of the canal, and the river is carried in a tunnel under the Castlefield canal basin, reappearing at Potato Wharf, where it is supplemented by excess canal water draining into a circular weir. When the river is in flood, the tunnel cannot cope and river water enters the canal, flows across the basin, and exits via the weir and manually operated gates. further on, the Medlock enters the Irwell adjacent to the bottom gate of the disused Hulme Locks.

==Navigation==
In the latter part of the 18th century the river was navigable at least between the Bridgewater Canal (at Deansgate) and the site of India House (on Whitworth Street). At India House was the entrance to a tunnel used to carry coal to a wharf at Store Street (by Piccadilly station). The tunnel mouth is still visible. The tunnel was rendered obsolete by silting of the river and the construction of the Rochdale Canal.

==Notable features==

The area just south of Oxford Road railway station enclosed by the railway line and the loop in the river was known as Little Ireland, and was described by Friedrich Engels as &quot;the most horrible spot&quot; of the area.
It is commemorated by a red plaque on the wall of 8 Great Marlborough Street, about half-way between New Wakefield Street and Hulme Street.

About west of the plaque, there stands the Statue of Friedrich Engels at Tony Wilson Place. The statue was moved from Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and has the now-culverted flow of River Medlock between Anne Horniman Street and City Road East beneath.

The telephone exchange name, and subsequent dialling code for the area around Strinesdale, Moorside, and Grains Bar, was Medlock Head, abbreviated to MED for dialling. This was so at the time of the introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialling to the area in the 1960s. The name owed less to local geography than to technology. The code MED was rendered as 633 on the telephone dial. MAI, the code for Oldham Main, was 624. Post Office Telecoms equipment of the day worked better when discrete local geographical areas, then with relatively few subscribers, had similar prefixes. These numbers, and others beginning with 6, remain in use in Greater Manchester, prefixed by 0161.

<text>CJCL (590 AM, &quot;Sportsnet 590 The Fan&quot;) is a Canadian sports radio station in Toronto, Ontario. Owned and operated by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media since 2002, CJCL&#x27;s studios are located at the Rogers Building at Bloor and Jarvis in downtown Toronto, while its transmitters are located near Grimsby atop the Niagara Escarpment. It is the flagship station for the Toronto Blue Jays, and also airs games from the Toronto Raptors, Toronto Maple Leafs, Buffalo Bisons and Buffalo Bills. CJCL is a Infinity Sports Network affiliate.

The station was originally owned by longtime sportscaster Foster Hewitt and began broadcasting on February 21, 1951, as CKFH 1400 before moving to 1430 AM in 1960. Telemedia acquired the station in 1981 and relaunched it as CJCL. During its early life, the station aired news and sports, Top 40, country music, adult contemporary and talk radio formats. It adopted the current sports format on September 4, 1992, as &quot;The Fan 1430&quot; as Canada&#x27;s first all-sports radio station before swapping frequencies with CKYC 590, acquired in 1994 by Telemedia, on February 6, 1995, adopting &quot;The Fan 590&quot; branding. After Telemedia was sold to Standard Broadcasting, Rogers acquired CJCL in 2002.

Due to its location near the top of the AM dial, as well as its transmitter power and height, CJCL covers most of southern Ontario during the day. The station&#x27;s signal is directional from north to south to protect various lower-powered radio stations east and west of the station. CJCL is simulcast across Canada on Bell Satellite TV channel 959, and on Shaw Direct channel 868. It is also carried on the 3rd HD digital subchannel of CKIS-FM.

==History==
The station first aired on February 21, 1951, as CKFH; operating at 1400 kHz. It was a news and sports station owned by legendary Canadian broadcaster Foster Hewitt (the &quot;FH&quot; of the call sign), who was best known as the first and long-time play-by-play announcer for the Toronto Maple Leafs on what became &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. The station moved to 1430 kHz in 1960, increasing power first to 5,000, then 10,000 and finally 50,000 watts. In its first years, CKFH was a full service station with news, drama, and variety programs, but specialized in sports broadcasting away games of the Toronto Maple Leafs as well as &quot;reconstructed&quot; play-by-play broadcasts of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The station also carried a number of foreign-language programs produced by ethnic broadcasters such as Sam Yuchtman&#x27;s Yiddish-language &quot;Jewish Hour&quot; and Italian-language programs produced by Johnny Lombardi until Lombardi launched his own station, CHIN, in 1966. CKFH adopted a Top 40 format that same year. It then moved to a country format in 1975.
 
The station was subsequently sold to Telemedia in 1981 when it adopted its current CJCL call sign and switched to an adult contemporary format. In 1983, the station briefly adopted talk programming, but returned to its music format within a few months, with increased emphasis on oldies. CJCL was the flagship of the Telemedia network, and as such, broadcast Toronto Blue Jays baseball games (with Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth calling the action) followed by hours of talk after the game. The station has been flagship radio station of the Blue Jays for most of their history since their inception in 1977 (with exception of a hiatus when CHUM was the flagship from 1998 to 2002). As the 1980s progressed, and the winning Blue Jays became more popular, the sports features became CJCL&#x27;s profit centre. Encouraged by the newfound success of sports radio in the United States, in 1992, the year the Blue Jays won their first World Series, CJCL would drop non-sports programming altogether on September 4, and became &quot;The Fan 1430&quot;, the first all-sports station in Canada. The station&#x27;s nickname may have been inspired by WFAN in New York City, the first sports radio station in the world that led to the creation of sports radio stations everywhere.

In 1994, Telemedia acquired CKYC from Rogers, and on February 6, 1995, at noon, the two stations switched frequencies, with &quot;The Fan&quot; moving to 590 AM (subsequently becoming &quot;The Fan 590&quot;) and CKYC moving to 1430 AM (where it operates today as multilingual station CHKT). Telemedia was acquired in 2002 by Standard Broadcasting, who resold CJCL to Rogers Media.

In January 2011, CJCL became known as &quot;Sportsnet Radio The Fan 590&quot;, the move coming as part of a co-branding initiative with its television counterpart Sportsnet, amid indications that rival TSN was preparing to launch a competing sports radio station, TSN Radio 1050. The station&#x27;s on-air identity was then changed to &quot;Sportsnet 590 The Fan&quot; in October 2011.

The station also provides sports news updates for its sister station, all-news radio CFTR.

==Live sports==
CJCL is the flagship station for the following teams&#x27; radio broadcasts:

*Toronto Blue Jays (MLB baseball)
*Toronto Raptors (NBA basketball)♠
*Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL hockey)♠

♠-In case of conflicts with other sports broadcasts, one of the games will air on another station in the Toronto area. As Rogers owns the Blue Jays outright but only shares ownership (through Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment) of the Raptors and Maple Leafs, the Blue Jays games have first priority on CJCL. CHUM shares rights to the other two teams, including all games that are played at the same time as the Blue Jays. In contrast, because of an exclusive CFL-wide multimedia deal with TSN that ensures all Toronto Argonauts games air on CHUM, any Raptors or Maple Leaf games that conflict with the Argonauts will air on CJCL. The two stations split the broadcasts of games that do not conflict with each other.

Roughly 11 Buffalo Bisons games (as of 2018) air on evening dates between June and August that do not conflict with Blue Jays games. The Bisons are the Triple-A East affiliate of the Blue Jays, and broadcasts originate from Buffalo-based WWKB.

The Fan 590 also features live coverage of the following:
*Buffalo Bills (NFL football)
*NBA All-Star Game
*Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio (Sunday nights, All-Star Game &amp; postseason; when not conflicting with Blue Jays games &amp; weekday afternoon sports talk radio programming)
*Memorial Cup hockey (championship game)
*NFL Football (Sunday afternoons)

Previous live sports events on CJCL included:
*Toronto Argonauts (CFL football) (2000–2001, 2007–2010)
*Toronto FC (MLS soccer)
*Ice Hockey World Championships (Team Canada games)

*Toronto Rock (NLL lacrosse) (2006)

<text>Blood brother can refer to two or more people not related by birth who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a blood oath, where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand, or the forearm, and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person&#x27;s blood now flows in the other participant&#x27;s veins.

The act carries a risk due to blood-borne diseases. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with the other participant.

==Cultures==
===Germanic===
The Norsemen entering the pact of foster brotherhood () involved a rite in which they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in &quot;Gísla saga&quot;. In &quot;Fóstbræðra saga&quot;, the bond of Thorgeir Havarsson (Þorgeir Hávarsson) and Thormod Bersason (Þormóð Bersason) is sealed by such ritual as well, the ritual being called a &quot;leikr&quot;.

&quot;Örvar-Oddr&#x27;s saga&quot; contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. Örvar-Oddr, after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior Hjalmar to a draw, entered a foster brotherhood with him by the turf-raising ritual. Afterwards, the strand of turf was put back during oaths and incantations. 

In the mythology of Northern Europe, Gunther and Högni became the blood brothers of Sigurd when he married their sister Gudrun. In Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, the concluding part of his &quot;Ring Cycle&quot;, the same occurs between Gunther and Wagner&#x27;s version of Sigurd, Siegfried, which is marked by the &quot;Blood Brotherhood Leitmotiv&quot;. Additionally, it is briefly stated in Lokasenna that Odin and Loki are blood brothers.

===Scythia===
Among the Scythians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having three blood brotherhoods at any time lest his loyalties be distrusted. As a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship (Lucian, &quot;Toxaris&quot;). The
4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single drinking horn (most notably in a gold appliqué from Kul-Oba) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.

The Hungarian hajduks had a similar ceremony, but the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible.

===East Asia===
In Asian cultures, the act and the ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a tribal relationship for bringing about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for that reason most notably by the Mongols, Turkic and early Chinese.

In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother, the Oath of the Peach Garden, by sacrificing a black ox and a white horse and by swearing faith. Other blood oaths involving animal sacrifice were characteristic of rebel groups, such as the uprising led by Deng Maoqi in the 1440s, of criminal organizations, such as the triads or the pirates of Lin Daoqian, and other East Asians such as the Mongols and the Manchu. Genghis Khan had an &quot;anda&quot; called Jamukha. The term also exist in Old Turkic: &quot;ant ičmek&quot; (&quot;to take an oath&quot;), derived from the &quot;ancient test by poison&quot;. The Turkic term, if it&#x27;s not a loanword in Middle Mongol, is related to Mongol &quot;anda&quot;.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, blood compacts (&quot;sandugo&quot; or &quot;sanduguan&quot;, literally &quot;one blood&quot;) were ancient rituals that were intended to seal a friendship or treaty or to validate an agreement. They were described in the records of the early Spanish and Portuguese explorers to the islands. The most well-known version of the ritual from the Visayan people involves mixing a drop of blood from both parties into a single cup of wine that is then drunk. Other versions also exist, like in Palawan which describes a ritual involving making a cut on the chest and then daubing the blood on the tongue and forehead.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
The blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. The British colonial administrator Lord Lugard is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy in Africa. A powerful blood brother was the Kikuyu chieftain Waiyaki Wa Hinga. David Livingstone wrote of a similar practice called &#x27;Kasendi&#x27;.

===Southeastern Europe===
Blood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient Southeastern Europe, where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the Balkans during the Ottoman era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively. Blood brotherhoods were common in what is today Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia and North Macedonia. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony, which was known as , in the Eastern Orthodox Churches and as in the Catholic Church. The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers.

==Famous blood brothers==

=== Historical ===
* In the 9th century AD, chiefs of the seven Hungarian tribes formed an alliance drinking from each other&#x27;s blood, and chose Álmos as leader.
* In 1066, Robert d&#x27;Ouilly and Roger d&#x27;Ivry, two Norman knights taking part in the Norman Conquest of England were known as blood brothers. It was said they had agreed beforehand to share profits of this adventure. Both survived the Battle of Hastings, were granted lands in Oxfordshire and elsewhere, then worked together on various projects such as Wallingford Castle.
* In the 12th century AD, the Mongol leaders Yesükhei (father of Temüjin) and Toghrul (later ally of Temüjin) were blood brothers.
* Temüjin (Genghis Khan) and Jamukha were childhood friends and blood brothers, although Jamukha later betrayed Temüjin. Jamukha refused reconciliation and thus was executed at the orders of Temüjin.
* In the 18th century AD, emissaries of British King George III and leaders of the Jamaican Maroons reportedly drank each other&#x27;s blood when conducting peace treaties.
* Blood brothers in the Serbian Revolution (1804–17): rebel leader Karađorđe (1762–1817) and commander Milutin Savić (1762–1842); Karađorđe and Greek volunteer Giorgakis Olympios (1772–1821); commander Hajduk-Veljko (1780–1813) and Giorgakis Olympios; commanders Stojan Čupić (1765–1815) and Bakal-Milosav; commanders Cincar-Janko (1779–1833), Miloš Stojićević Pocerac (1776–1811) and Anta Bogićević (1758–1813).
* Blood brothers in the later Principality of Serbia: Prince Milan Obrenović (1854–1901) and Milan Piroćanac (1837–1897); Aćim Čumić (1836–1901) and Kosta Protić (1831–1892); Đura Jakšić (1832–1878) and Stevan Vladislav Kaćanski (1829–1890).
* In the Greek War of Independence (1821–30), Greek Nikolaos Kriezotis and Montenegrin Vaso Brajević were said to be blood brothers.
* Samoan wrestler &quot;High Chief&quot; Peter Maivia was considered a blood brother of Amituanai Anoaʻi, father of fellow wrestlers Afa and Sika Anoaʻi, renown as the Wild Samoans, who regard Peter as their uncle. Thus, from that time onwards, the &quot;Anoaʻi&quot; family regard the &quot;Maivia&quot; line as an extension of their own clan.

=== Folklore===
* The Norse gods Loki and Odin are famously stated to have mixed blood in &quot;days of old&quot; in &quot;Lokasenna&quot;. This has been taken as an explanation why Loki is at all tolerated by the gods. 
* Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. In the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong, these three men swore in their famous Oath of the Peach Garden that despite not being born on the same day, their sworn brotherhood would end with them dying on the same day. Histories only mention that the three men were &quot;close like brothers&quot;.
* In the Chinese tale &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Sun Wukong (the Monkey King) became blood brothers with Niu Mowang (the Bull Demon King) and several other demon leaders, but later on this brother relationship was forgotten because of a conflict that occurred involving the bull demon&#x27;s son that caused other problems for Wukong. Wukong also mentions being sworn brothers with Erlang Shen. Erlang has six other sworn brothers from Plum Hill.
* In Serbian epic poetry, there are several blood brotherhoods. Miloš Obilić with Milan Toplica and Ivan Kosančić, Miloš Obilić with Prince Marko, Miloš Obilić with the Jugović brothers, Despot Vuk Grgurević and Dmitar Jakšić.

=== Literature ===
* Winnetou and Old Shatterhand in works of Karl May.
* The characters Edward Lyons and Mickey Johnstone in Willy Russell&#x27;s Blood Brothers.

<text>Archimedes is a large lunar impact crater on the eastern edges of the Mare Imbrium. Its diameter is 81 km.
== Description ==
The diameter of Archimedes is the largest of any crater on the Mare Imbrium. The rim has a significant outer rampart brightened with ejecta and the upper portion of a terraced inner wall, but lacks the ray system associated with younger craters. A triangular promontory extends 30 kilometers from the southeast of the rim.

The interior of the crater lacks a central peak, and is flooded with lava. It is devoid of significant raised features, although there are a few tiny meteor craters near the rim. Scattered wisps of bright ray material lie across the floor, most likely deposited by the impact that created Autolycus.

Archimedes is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.
==Surroundings==
To the south of Archimedes extends the Montes Archimedes, a mountainous region. On the southeastern rim is the Palus Putredinis, a lava-flooded plain containing a system of rilles named the Rimae Archimedes, which extends over 150 kilometers. North-northwest of Archimedes stand the Montes Spitzbergen, a string of peaks in the Mare Imbrium. East of Archimedes is the crater Autolycus. Northeast of Archimedes is the prominent crater Aristillus. The lava plain between Archimedes, Aristillus, and Autolycus forms the Sinus Lunicus bay of Mare Imbrium. A wrinkle ridge leads away from Archimedes toward the north-northwest, crossing this mare.

==Names==
Archimedes is named after the Greek scientist Archimedes. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Roma&quot; after the city of Rome. Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Mons Argentarius&quot; after Monte Argentario region in Italy.

==Exploration==
The stretch of lunar surface between Archimedes and Autolycus was the site of the crash-landing of the Soviet probe Luna 2. This was the first craft to reach the surface of the Moon, landing September 13, 1959.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Archimedes.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Archimedes A - &quot;See&quot; Bancroft (crater).
* Archimedes F - &quot;See&quot; MacMillan (crater).
* Archimedes K - &quot;See&quot; Spurr (crater).

<text>Maynard James Keenan (born James Herbert Keenan; April 17, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, philanthropist, record producer, and winemaker. He is best known as the singer and primary lyricist of the rock bands Tool, A Perfect Circle, and Puscifer.

Having grown up in Ohio and Michigan, Keenan joined the U.S. Army after graduating from high school. After his service, he attended the Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1988 to pursue a career in interior design and set construction, and formed Tool with Adam Jones shortly thereafter.

In addition to his music career, Keenan owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars in Arizona, where he resides. Since rising to fame, he has been noted as a recluse, although he does emerge to support charitable causes and for the occasional interview. He has also ventured into acting.

==Early life==

James Herbert Keenan was born in Ravenna, Ohio, on April 17, 1964, the only child of Southern Baptists Judith Marie (née Dougherty; 19432003) and Michael Van Keenan (1937-2025). He is of Irish and Italian descent. When his parents divorced in 1968, his father moved to Scottville, Michigan, and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an &quot;intolerant and unworldly household&quot; where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled. His mother suffered a paralyzing subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm in 1976 when Keenan was 11, and this incident would later serve as the inspiration for songs such as Tool&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy,&quot; &quot;The Patient,&quot; and &quot;Wings for Marie,&quot; as well as A Perfect Circle&#x27;s &quot;Judith.&quot; A few years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Scottville, which he considers &quot;the best move [he] ever made&quot;. In 1982, he graduated from Mason County Central High School in Scottville, where he was a member of the wrestling team. His father was one of the coaches for the team and left coaching at the same time Keenan graduated in 1982.

Inspired by Bill Murray&#x27;s performance in the 1981 comedy film &quot;Stripes&quot;, Keenan joined the United States Army, with the intention of having the G.I. Bill fund his dream of attending art school. By this point, he had lived in Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas. He initially served in the Army as a forward observer before studying at West Point Prep School from 1983 to 1984.

In addition to completing a rigorous math and English curriculum, Keenan wrestled, ran on the cross country team, and sang in the glee club. It was during his time in the military that he adopted the sobriquet &quot;Maynard&quot; on a whim, based on a fictional character he had created in high school. He declined an appointment to West Point and instead chose to pursue a music career because of his disillusionment with his colleagues&#x27; values and because he believed West Point would not tolerate his dissidence.

==Music career==
===Early bands===
Upon completing his term of prep school, Keenan studied art at Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. From there he moved to Somerville, Massachusetts, where his love of animals led him to practice interior design for a Boston-area pet store. He was transferred to a store in Los Angeles, before he was quickly fired and began working in set construction. During the 1980s, Keenan played bass guitar for TexA.N.S. and sang for Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty, both independent bands. During this time, he wrote an early version of &quot;Sober&quot;, later Tool&#x27;s first successful single. He also (with future Tool bandmate Danny Carey) performed live and recorded with Green Jellö between 1990 and 1993, playing guitar and performing backup vocals as the voice of one of the pigs on the band&#x27;s hit song &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; on their debut album &quot;Cereal Killer&quot;, and appearing in the music video for &quot;Slave Boy&quot; on the band&#x27;s follow-up LP &quot;333&quot;. Around this time he also struck up a friendship with Tom Morello, who has credited Keenan with introducing him to Drop D tuning. Keenan spent time jamming with Morello and Brad Wilk, as did Zack de la Rocha: Morello and Wilk considered Keenan and de la Rocha as candidates for the vocalist with what would become Rage Against the Machine before deciding to ask the latter.

===Tool===

After moving to Los Angeles, Keenan met Adam Jones who had in college heard him singing on a demo. Impressed with Keenan&#x27;s vocals, Jones suggested that they form a band. Reluctant, Keenan eventually agreed and, in 1990, Tool was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included guitarist Jones; his neighbor, drummer Danny Carey; and bassist Paul D&#x27;Amour, who would later be replaced by Justin Chancellor.

Tool signed to Zoo Entertainment in November 1991 and released the &quot;Opiate&quot; EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with Fishbone and Rage Against the Machine.

Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, &quot;Undertow&quot;, in the United States. It was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later. In 1994, the band released their single &quot;Prison Sex&quot; with a corresponding music video created and directed by Jones. The video was deemed &quot;too graphic and offensive&quot;, and was withdrawn by MTV after a few airings due to &quot;a symbolic dealing with the sensitive subject of child abuse&quot;.

In September 1996, the band released their second studio album, &quot;Ænima&quot;. The album was certified gold in ten weeks, achieved double platinum in ten months, and won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1998. After the release of the album, Tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label, Volcano Records (formerly Zoo Records), over contract violations. Following this legal battle, which resulted in a new three-record deal, the members of Tool decided to take some time off. During the hiatus, Keenan went under the alias &quot;Gaylord C.&quot; while collaborating with Tim Alexander of Primus and Mike Bordin of Faith No More on &quot;Choked&quot;, a track on the 1997 drumming compilation &quot;Flyin&#x27; Traps&quot;.

The band members were outspokenly critical of peer-to-peer file sharing networks, due to the negative financial effect on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with &quot;NY Rock&quot; in 2000, Keenan stated, &quot;I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs.&quot;

Five years after the release of &quot;Ænima&quot;, Tool announced a new album, &quot;Systema Encéphale&quot;, with a 12-song track list in January 2001. A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled &quot;Lateralus&quot; and that the previous announcement had been a ruse. The album was released in May 2001 to positive reviews. Known for his &quot;dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists&quot;, Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he &quot;doesn&#x27;t cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... as often as he has in the past&quot;. In an interview with &quot;NY Rock&quot;, Keenan explained, &quot;Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is a video or if its lyrics. The lyrics for &quot;Schism&quot; are nothing more than my interpretation of the music.&quot; The album became a worldwide success, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart in its debut week, and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for &quot;Schism&quot;. In 2002, Keenan recorded a song called &quot;Fallen&quot; with Thirty Seconds to Mars that was released on the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

15 years after the band&#x27;s formation, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of &quot;Revolver&quot; described as a devoted &quot;cult&quot; following, and in May 2006 the band released &quot;10,000 Days&quot;, an album in which Keenan sang about more personal issues in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change. His mother, who inspired the song &quot;Jimmy&quot; on &quot;Ænima&quot;, also served as the inspiration for &quot;Jambi&quot;, and the two-part song &quot;Wings for Marie&quot; and &quot;10,000 Days (Wings for Marie, Pt 2)&quot;, which deals with her 2003 death after 27 years, or around 10,000 days, of suffering. The album sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. However, &quot;10,000 Days&quot; was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor &quot;Lateralus&quot; had been.

Following &quot;10,000 Days&quot;, Tool had one album remaining to fulfill the obligation of its record contract. Over the course of the following years, the band slowly made progress towards its fifth studio release. Tool has worked around Keenan and his side projects since 1999, starting with the creation of A Perfect Circle, which has led to several years between projects. Regarding the future of Tool, Keenan stated in a 2007 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ll make music together until one of us is dead.&quot;

On March 24, 2009, a summer tour was announced on Tool&#x27;s website, and in a March 26 press release Tool was confirmed as a headliner for the second annual Mile High Music Festival in Commerce City, Colorado, with Widespread Panic and The Fray. Tool also headlined Lollapalooza 2009 in Chicago, Illinois.

On August 7, 2019, Tool released the title track for &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot; across all streaming services. At the 62nd Grammy Awards, the band won Best Metal Performance, for the track &quot;7empest&quot; from the album.

===A Perfect Circle===
During Tool&#x27;s post-&quot;Ænima&quot; hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool&#x27;s guitar tech through the &quot;Ænima&quot; tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, &quot;eMOTIVe&quot;, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles &quot;Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums&quot;—a song inspired by &quot;Pet&quot; that was originally released on &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;—and &quot;Passive&quot;. Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he &quot;tested the waters&quot; and was subsequently &quot;crucified&quot; for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled &quot;aMotion&quot;, which was certified platinum within a month of its release.

Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup&#x27;s work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band&#x27;s last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with &quot;Revolver&quot;. He stated:


When asked, in an interview for &quot;Spin&quot; that same month, about the possibility of another A Perfect Circle album, Keenan stated, &quot;Maybe, someday, a song on a soundtrack. But an album? No.&quot; A year later, on December 9, 2008, blabbermouth.net reported that Keenan had announced on The Pulse of Radio that he and Howerdel have been writing new music for A Perfect Circle. Keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume full-scale touring, or even to write and record a new album. Instead, they will focus on &quot;one or two songs at a time&quot;, which will most likely be released via the Internet.

However, in November 2010, the band returned from a nearly six-and-a-half-year hiatus with a 14-show tour in the western US. Touring resumed in May 2011 with a North American tour across the US and Canada that wrapped up at the end of August. The band performed only once in 2012 with a show of December 29 in Las Vegas, followed by a five-show Australian tour and a three-show South American tour in early 2013.

===Puscifer===

In 2003, Keenan surfaced under the name &quot;Puscifer&quot; for the song &quot;REV 22:20&quot; on the &quot;Underworld&quot; film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails, but has since been &quot;formed as a manifestation of [Keenan&#x27;s] creative subconscious&quot;—interpreted to mean that the name is now a pseudonym for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is &quot;a premiere improvisational hardcore band&quot;, and his &quot;catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc.&quot; project. When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Keenan described it as his &quot;attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man&#x27;s music, but groove-oriented music that makes you feel good.&quot; In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles. He wanted the complexity to be in the music, stating &quot;that&#x27;s the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good.&quot;

In 2006, Puscifer contributed the song &quot;The Undertaker (Renholder Mix)&quot; to the of &quot;&quot;, where &quot;Renholder&quot;, a moniker for Danny Lohner created by the members of A Perfect Circle, is the reversal of &quot;Re: D Lohner&quot;. Keenan financed and released the first studio album, &quot;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vagina&quot;, in October 2007. Created in a tour bus, in several hotel rooms, and in various studios around the country while Keenan toured with Tool, the album is a radical departure from Keenan&#x27;s contributions in Tool and A Perfect Circle. Tim Alexander, best known as the drummer for rock band Primus, was a guest musician on the album. He called Puscifer &quot;trancy and hypnotic&quot; and a &quot;total 180 from Tool&quot;. The album was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in Keenan&#x27;s previous work.

Puscifer is also a clothing line, with merchandise available for purchase on the band&#x27;s website. On September 16, 2008, Keenan updated the puscifer.com blog, revealing that the first ever Puscifer store would be opening &quot;hopefully&quot; by October 1 in Jerome, Arizona. Occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor, the store opened on October 3, 2008. In addition to the merchandise available on the band&#x27;s online store, Keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee, art, and limited edition collectibles.

On February 13–15, 2009, Keenan debuted Puscifer at the Pearl Concert Theater in Palms Casino Resort in Paradise, Nevada, with a cabaret-style show so abstract it is not easily described. In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Keenan stated &quot;we didn&#x27;t really have any clue what to call it, so we just kind of called it cabaret.&quot; Keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment, having fronted a similar show in Los Angeles before achieving fame with Tool—went on to add that &quot;you just can&#x27;t really describe it, you just have to see it, then it makes sense.&quot; Featuring an ever-changing lineup of artists including Milla Jovovich and Primus drummer Tim Alexander, the show was originally said to have a long-term residency at the Pearl; however, Keenan later revealed that it was to be only a two-show performance.
Puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout 2009 at venues around the Southwest. However, in a November 2009 interview, Keenan stated: &quot;Efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the Southwestern United States have been thwarted. We are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise Eastward and share our special sauce. Although authorities suggest you be prepared for any and all possibilities, we simply suggest you arrive happy and hungry.&quot;

On October 18, 2011, Keenan released Puscifer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Conditions of My Parole&quot;. The album received generally favorable reviews on Metacritic, a positive review from Allmusic&#x27;s Gregory Heaney, who described it as &quot;a fine piece of cold weather headphone music.&quot; Keenan followed with the February 19, 2013, release of &quot;Donkey Punch the Night&quot;. This EP includes covers of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen and &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot; by Accept. It received mostly mixed reviews, resulting in a Metacritic rating of 62%.

==Writing and performance style==

A primary purpose of Keenan&#x27;s lyrics for Tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level, encouraging them to look within themselves for self-identity, understanding and reflection. Tool did not include lyrics with any releases until &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;, as Keenan believes most people &quot;don&#x27;t get it&quot; and it is not a priority of the band that people do. However, after each release Keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semi-official fansite, with the exception of &quot;Lateralus&quot;, which was published on the official Tool website. Despite Maynard&#x27;s aversion to promoting the lyrical content of Tool&#x27;s work to its audience, lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in the lyrics to &quot;Lateralus&quot;, wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers, and &quot;Jambi&quot;, in which the metrical foot iamb is used. Keenan&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Ænima&quot; and &quot;Lateralus&quot; focused on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from evolution and Jungian psychology in &quot;Forty-Six &amp; 2&quot; and transcendence in &quot;Lateralus&quot;.

In live performances with Tool, Keenan has often been situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage, without a spotlight, facing the backdrop rather than the audience. Keenan claims this allows him to better take cues from bandmates. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band&#x27;s live video director, says that the dark spaces on stage &quot;are mostly for Maynard&quot;. He explains, &quot;a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he&#x27;s trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows.&quot; 

An exception, which surprised even devout Tool fans, occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug Keenan during the band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Pushit&quot;. After dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss, Keenan, continuing to sing, wrapped himself around the man&#x27;s back into a rear naked choke. He held the man without actually constricting his neck, allowing him to raise his fist in celebration. Keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back, where he stayed for &quot;an uncomfortably long period of time.&quot; His appearance with Tool has included the Mohawk hairstyle, wigs, Kabuki masks, bras, tights, and his entire body in blue paint. This is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting A Perfect Circle.

Describing Keenan&#x27;s contribution to Tool and A Perfect Circle, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;both groups rely on Mr. Keenan&#x27;s ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity&quot;. He ranked No. 21 in &quot;Hit Parader&quot;&#x27;s 2006 list of &quot;Heavy Metal&#x27;s All-Time Top 100 Vocalists&quot;, and his style of singing has been considered influential to Pete Loeffler of Chevelle and Jared Leto of Thirty Seconds to Mars. He has been described as a baritone, and reportedly has a range of 4 octaves (G1-G5).

==Comedy and acting==

Keenan is featured in several segments of &quot;Mr. Show&quot;, most notably in the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season in which he plays the lead singer of the then-fictitious band &quot;Puscifer&quot;. He also appears in episode 2.6, &quot;The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop&quot;. Later, Keenan sang on a track for the &quot;Mr. Show&quot; incarnation &quot;Run Ronnie Run&quot;, and appears in the &quot;music video sex scene&quot; on its DVD. Keenan appeared on the cover of the May/June 1999 issue of &quot;Pop Smear&quot; magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous &quot;Life&quot; magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film &quot;Bikini Bandits&quot; and its 2004 sequel &quot;Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod&quot;. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, &quot;Oh, Manson. He&#x27;s a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there&#x27;s so much gray area.&quot;

In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created &quot;Free Frances Bean&quot; tee-shirts to represent his own platform. Frances&#x27;s mother, Courtney Love, had previously referred to Keenan as a &quot;media whore&quot; to which he responded, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that great? I have the distinction of being called a media whore by Courtney Love.&quot; He said that after watching &quot;the tornado that is her mother&quot;, he thought &quot;Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?&quot; Although it was started as a simple joke, the T-shirts were soon in high demand and Keenan began giving them away.

On April 1, 2005, the official Tool website announced, as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank, that &quot;Maynard has found Jesus&quot; and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently. Kurt Loder of MTV contacted Keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation. When Loder asked again, Keenan&#x27;s response was simply &quot;heh heh&quot;. On April 7, the official site revealed that it was a hoax. During an interview Keenan later stated, &quot;It was April Fools&#x27;. If you fall for that on April Fools&#x27; Day, there&#x27;s nothing I can do for you.&quot; He has been part of other April Fools&#x27; pranks related to Tool, including one in which he was said to be in critical condition after a tour bus accident.

Keenan made a cameo in the 2009 film &quot;&quot;. In May 2015, Keenan made a cameo in an episode of &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot; as fictional punk musician Barf Edwards.

==Winemaking and other endeavors==
In addition to a produce market in Cornville, Arizona; Keenan, whose grandparents and great-uncle made wine in Northern Italy, owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars, based in the unincorporated area of Page Springs/Cornville, Arizona, southwest of Sedona, where he resides. While the winery is named after an ancient symbol for commerce (caduceus), the vineyard is named after a pubic wig (merkin). He is also a partner of Stronghold Vineyards, &quot;an 80-acre site dedicated to producing affordable wines in the state&quot;, located in the small, unincorporated area known as Kansas Settlement in Sulfur Springs Valley, Arizona.

Keenan&#x27;s mother died in 2003, at the age of 59, due to complications from an aneurysm. Following her death, he scattered her ashes across one of his vineyards, and later named one of his wines after her, honoring her memory with his Cabernet Sauvignon &quot;Nagual del Judith&quot;. Keenan released a statement in April 2009:

His previous wines were named after relatives of the Chiricahua Apache chief Cochise who lived in the area where the vineyard is located, and were produced at Page Springs Cellars, owned by Keenan&#x27;s business partner. While those wines used some fruits imported from California, &quot;Nagual del Judith&quot; was the first made entirely from Keenan&#x27;s own vineyard. Keenan was also a part-owner of Cobras &amp; Matadors, an LA restaurant run by Steven Arroyo until 2012.

During the fall season of 2008, Keenan and his Stronghold Vineyards partner Eric Glomski promoted his wine with signing sessions at Whole Foods Markets in California and Nevada. The tour continued in 2009 with sessions in Texas kicking off in March, and appearances scheduled during Tool&#x27;s 2009 summer tour in Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. In July 2009, Keenan opened an organic market which features a tasting room for his Arizona wines as well as a food court.

Keenan is featured in &quot;Blood into Wine: The Arizona Stronghold&quot;, a documentary co-produced by &quot;Moog&quot; filmmakers Ryan Page and Christopher Pomerenk that chronicles Keenan and Glomski&#x27;s winemaking in the desert conditions of Arizona&#x27;s Verde Valley. The film, which includes appearances from Tim &amp; Eric, Patton Oswalt, and Milla Jovovich, was shown at the Noise Pop Festival on February 25, 2010.

The same festival also showed another documentary produced by Pomerenk, &quot;The Heart is a Drum Machine&quot;. It investigates why people create and listen to music, and features Keenan, Jason Schwartzman, Kurt Loder, Nic Harcourt, Juliette Lewis, and Elijah Wood.

== Autobiography ==
In a January 2013 interview with &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, Keenan announced work on an autobiography.

Keenan&#x27;s authorized biography, &quot;A Perfect Union of Contrary Things&quot;, was released on November 8, 2016.

==Philanthropy==
Keenan performed at a 1997 benefit concert for RAINN (the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network) organized by Tori Amos (who had often referred to Keenan as an unofficial brother). He is one of the notable performers for Axis of Justice, a non-profit organization that brings musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations together to fight for social justice. In 2004, Axis of Justice released &quot;Concert Series Volume 1&quot;. Included are two tracks featuring Keenan on vocals. The second track on the album, &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;, was recorded live during Lollapalooza in Seattle, Washington on August 23, 2003. The first track, &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, was recorded live during the Axis of Justice Concert Series at The Avalon in Hollywood on July 19, 2004. In February 2005, Keenan appeared as a surprise vocalist at a Seattle benefit concert for victims of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in southern Asia, performing with the partly reformed Alice in Chains, in place of the deceased vocalist Layne Staley, on the songs &quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, and &quot;Rooster&quot;.

==Personal life==
Keenan has a son, Devo, who sang backing vocals on A Perfect Circle&#x27;s &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, and was later credited as the cellist on Ashes Divide&#x27;s &quot;Keep Telling Myself It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. He also gave a solo cello performance for Keenan&#x27;s 50th birthday celebration concert, &quot;Cinquanta&quot;.

Two songs bear the name of Keenan&#x27;s mother, Judith Marie: &quot;Wings for Marie (Pt. 1)&quot; by Tool and &quot;Judith&quot; by A Perfect Circle.

Keenan has a reputation for being reclusive and controlling of his public image. He dislikes the manner in which celebrities are worshipped, and at one point carried business cards with the name &quot;Jesus H. Christ&quot; printed on them. When dealing with stalkers, Keenan has resorted to using a paintball gun to run off trespassers from his property. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of Keenan&#x27;s pursuits, as shown when he took down a fan who ran on stage in the middle of a performance and put them in a rear naked choke, and he studied under Rickson Gracie. In November 2021, Keenan was promoted to brown belt in BJJ by 6th degree black belt Luis Heredia. In January 2024, he was promoted to black belt in the art.

It was announced in June 2010 that Keenan had proposed to girlfriend and Caduceus lab manager Lei Li. On September 10, 2012, Keenan wrote an article for the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; in which he made reference to his wife. On July 25, 2014, Keenan&#x27;s wife gave birth to their daughter.

<text>Liepāja International Airport is a regional airport in western Latvia which is certified for international air traffic. Along with Riga International Airport and Ventspils Airport, it is one of the three major airports in Latvia.

==Overview==
Liepāja International Airport is situated in South Kurzeme Municipality, east of Liepāja, from the capital of Latvia, Riga, and from the Lithuanian border. The territory of the airport covers and is integrated within the Liepāja Special Economic Zone.

On September 20, 2016, the airport was recertified for handling commercial flights after a gap of eight years. On December 5, 2016, airBaltic conducted a test flight from Riga to Liepāja using their Bombardier CS300 aircraft. On December 6, 2016, it was announced that they would be conducting a further series of test flights in spring 2017. Flights to Riga began in 2017 with a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, between three and five times weekly, but ended in 2020.

== History ==
The airport first began operations as a military airfield in 1940. Early during the Cold War, the airfield was a Soviet Anti-Air Defense base. Its aircraft shot down a U.S. Air Force PB4Y-2 Privateer BuNo 59645 on April 8, 1950.

<text>Ventspils International Airport is an airport southwest of Ventspils, Latvia. It is the newest airport and, with Liepāja International Airport and Riga International Airport, is one of the three notable airports in the country.

==Overview==
Ventspils Airport was founded in 1939. From 1940, it was used by Soviet Aircraft. Once 1975 an asphalt-concrete runway () and an apron () were built. At that time there was an air control dispatchers point at the aerodrome and 40-45 employees worked in the airport. The aerodrome was used by aircraft AN-24, AN-2, YAK-40, MI-2. The flight range was small and there were only two scheduled flights: Ventspils - Riga and Ventspils - Leningrad (now St. Petersburg).

In addition to commercial traffic, state departments used the airport for various reasons. There were state border control flights, flights for oil pipeline control, forest patrols, traffic control, fishing inspection flights and others. Airport operation ceased in 1983 due to political decisions by the government.

The possibility re-opening the airport was first discussed in the mid-1990s by which time Ventspils had become an important transport hub. The efficiency and importance of the re-opening of the Ventspils Airport was evaluated.

The main conclusions of this research were that the rehabilitation of the airport would enhance the efficiency of transport corridors and foster economic activity in the region. The region possessed all the social and economic preconditions that indicate potential demand for air traffic. An operational Ventspils Airport would promote competitiveness of the Ventspils transport hub in the European and global markets.

At the time the re-opening of the airport was being considered, people in the Ventspils region and corporate clients who wished to travel by air used the airport at Riga that was away from Ventspils. This added 6–8 hours of travel time to the airport in Riga and back by road. These opportunities did not satisfy the demand for air transport traffic.

Work on the project &quot;The rehabilitation of the Airport Ventspils&quot; began in 1997. Implementation of the project began in 1999. It was developed within the National Transport Development Programme of the Republic of Latvia (1996–2010).

At the start of 2001, all documentation for the airport exploitation was prepared and a modern security program was developed. The plan of safety improvements for security standards was followed by the equipping of the temporary passenger service building and establishing an electric security system.

The most important result of the activities was the start of operation in 2000 upon receiving the certificate. The certificate confirmed that the aerodrome was suitable for exploitation and the first programs of flights were for conclusion that the first cycle of Ventspils Airport development was completed.

On 11 April 2008, Latvian national airline airBaltic began the first regular service from the airport to Riga but ceased after few months due to low patronage.

<text>Bancroft is a small, bowl-shaped impact crater located to the southwest of Archimedes on the Mare Imbrium. A wide, shallow depression runs from the rim of Bancroft southeast to the Montes Archimedes. There are some clefts at the edge of the mare to the west and southwest of the crater. Other prominent craters are two small craters nearly to the west named Feuillée and Beer.

Bancroft has a linear ridge in the center of its floor, which is unusual for a crater of 13 km diameter.

It was named after American chemist Wilder D. Bancroft. Bancroft was previously identified as Archimedes A before being renamed by the IAU in 1976.

<text>Flying disc freestyle, also known as freestyle Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name, is a sport and performing art characterized by creative, acrobatic, and athletic maneuvers with a flying disc. Freestyle is performed individually or more commonly in groups, both competitively and recreationally.

The Freestyle Players Association (FPA) is the governing body of freestyle, &quot;dedicated to the growth of freestyle disc play as a lifetime recreation and competitive sport. The organization is involved in international tournaments and rankings as well as education grants and promotional activities. Every year, the FPA holds a world championship with divisions in Open Pairs, Mixed Pairs, Open Co-op, and Women&#x27;s Pairs. Competitive freestyle is usually judged on execution, difficulty, and artistic impression by a panel of players.

==History==
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, modern flying discs had become a popular pastime in the United States, developing into various disciplines such as double disc court, disc guts, ultimate, disc golf, and disc freestyle. At the time, most disc players were overall players, participating in all the various disciplines. Freestyle began in the 1960s with a few players, like Victor Malafronte, John &quot;Z&quot; Weyand, Ken Westerfield, Kerry Kollmar and Dan Roddick trying to perform more complex trick catches and throws. Freestyle was introduced as its own competitive discipline, with the first Frisbee freestyle competitions occurring in 1974, at the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships, Toronto, Ontario, and the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships, Vancouver, BC.

Freestyle in the beginning before the invention of the &quot;nail delay&quot; catching possibilities would depend on the throw you were given, it was always spontaneous and unpredictable. Play of this type of freestyle was performed with two players standing 30–40 yards apart, the throws were fast and varied and the catches were right off the throw, except for the occasional kick or slap-up and rarely a pause between the catch and the throw back. At advanced levels, the throws and catches would become a flow that was created once you mastered the basics. It was fast and fluid and visibly would resemble martial arts and dance.

One of the earliest distinctly freestyle disc maneuver was the tip, the act of quickly pressing fingers on the bottom of the disc to maintain or alter its position without catching the disc or letting it fall to the ground. Tipping first began in the early 70s, becoming more popular and refined by 1975. The tip, according to some histories, eventually led to the nail delay, considered by many to be the beginning of modern freestyle.
The invention of the nail delay is disputed, but its first tournament appearance occurred when Freddie Haft performed the delay in the freestyle pairs event at the 1975 American Flying Disc Open (AFDO) in Rochester, NY. This was the first freestyle event held in the US. The nail delay involves balancing the disc on the fingernail while the disc continues to spin. This technique allows freestylers to change the flight path of the disc and perform numerous balletic and technical maneuvers such as restricted pulls, holds, turnovers, and shoots.

The pinnacle of freestyle as a commercial and popular venture was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Wham-O sponsored major tournament circuits culminating in the Rose Bowl, an overall event with a prominent freestyle component. Experienced players would collect points in smaller tournaments to win a spot in the Rose Bowl. Famous appearances include freestyle legends Johnny Dwork, Joey Hudoklin, Donnie Rhodes, Bill Wright, and Jens and Irwin Valasquez.

By 1981, Wham-O changed management and pulled its funding from freestyle. Subsequently, the growth of freestyle severely declined, with play mostly limited to Americans introduced to the sport in its first two decades. By the late 1990s, freestyle seemed to be in decline as few new players began playing. By the mid-2000s, however, the sport experienced a resurgence of growth in Europe, South America, and Japan. The cause of this resurgence is debated, but most attribute the growth to Paganello (a large, Italian ultimate tournament that sponsored a popular freestyle event) and its early proponents (and FPA Board members) Larry Imperiale and Paul Kenny, the impact of touring American players like Jens and Erwin Valasquez as well as Tom Leitner and Sune Wentzel (as part of a Nike tour), and a popular Nike commercial featuring two leading American freestylers, Dave Murphy and Dave Lewis. Today freestyle has a renewed popularity in the United States, as jammers across the country seek to emulate prodigy Emma Kahle (aka M-Maw), as well as in Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Israel and Colombia.

==Getting started==
Freestyle is performed indoors and outdoors, on fields and on the beach. The style and technique of players often depend on the conditions they play in, especially the wind. Freestyle jams, as they are called, involve anywhere from 2 to 15 people, but most hover between 2–5. A jam with more than 4 or 5 is often called a &quot;mob-op&quot; as opposed to pairs (2 players) or co-op (3 players). Most competitive freestyle today centers around the nail-delay with many players using what are called delay-aids (plastic nails and silicone sprays). There is also a faster throw and catch version that can be played without the use of delay-aids.

===Equipment and play===
Freestyle is performed with a lighter, usually 160 gram disc. The disc can be sprayed with some kind of lubricant for facilitating the nail delay such as silicone spray. In freestyle competitions, most advanced players wear fake nails made out of acrylic, some organic materials like bones or antlers, and other plastics, which are glued onto fingernails during play, though they are not necessary. A faster throwing and catching version of freestyle (fast-freestyle) can be played without the use of equipment (nail-delay paraphernalia, sprays and plastic nails).

==Basic maneuvers==

===Tipping===
Tipping is performed by poking the center of the disc with various body parts to cause the disc to &quot;pop up,&quot; usually maintaining the angle of the disc and its spin. Tipping is performed with finger tips, elbows, knees, feet, and even the top of the head. Joey Hudoklin&#x27;s famous tipping combo is considered the epitome of this technique.

===Brushing===
Brushing involves swiping the disc tangentially with the rotation of the disc. Brushing is performed with the hands, knees, and feet.

===Rolling===

Rolling, first demonstrated by Ken Westerfield in 1975, is performed when the disc rolls across any part of the body. The most common roll is the chest or front roll, which is performed when the disc rolls from one hand, across the chest, to the second hand to be caught or released for more maneuvers. Experienced players often perform front, back, and leg rolls, with and against the spin, in creative combination.

===Delaying===
The nail delay involves balancing the disc on the nail (or occasionally teeth, feet, and elbows) to manipulate the disc&#x27;s position. The delay can be performed on the rim of the disc in vertical, angled, or centered/flat positions. Most players have a spin preference, preferring either clockwise or counterclockwise, but most players, especially advanced players can perform maneuvers with both spins. The delay is characteristic of more modern, technical freestyle, which uses the delay to perform more complicated maneuvers like turnovers and &quot;against the spin&quot; moves (manipulations that use angle and carefully applied friction to force the disc in a direction that its spin counteracts, a technique invented and mastered by Skippy Jammer).

===Turnovers===
A turnover is performed when the disc is changed from a right-side up position to an upside-down position. The turnover is a popular, technical aspect of the game that requires proper leverage, a pivot point, and usually a &quot;spin change.&quot; A spin change involves changing the disc from counterclockwise to clock or clock to counterclockwise. The physics of turnover requires that the disc change spin, relative to the player, unless the turnover is a &quot;360&quot; turnover involving two spin changes, arriving back at the original spin.

===Catches===
Freestyle catches are generally split into two overlapping categories: blind and restricted. Blind catches are ones where the player cannot see the disc entering the hand and include popular moves such as scarecrow and phlaud. Restricted catches involve positioning the hand around some part of the body, such as under the leg or behind the back. One of the most famous and iconic freestyle catches is called &quot;gitis&quot; and involves catching a disc with one hand over and around the opposite leg. Catches can also be performed between the legs or by resting on parts of the body such as the back.

===Throws===
Freestyles often incorporate different kinds of throws to add difficulty and style as well as create various kinds of spin and angles. Basic throws include backhand, sidearm (forehand), overhand wrist-flip, staker, and helicopter. More advanced throws include blind, restricted, and special MAC throws (any throw that involves hitting the top of the disc mid-flight with a free limb, like the opposite hand, foot, or elbow, to create extra spin, slow the velocity, and change the angle).

<doc id="920512" wikidata="Q1126115" url="?curid=920512" title="Conker's Pocket Tales">
<text>Conker&#x27;s Pocket Tales is a 1999 action-adventure game developed and published by Rare for the Game Boy Color. It is the first game in the &quot;Conker&quot; series and follows the story of Conker the Squirrel as he retrieves his stolen birthday presents and rescues his girlfriend Berri, who has been kidnapped by the Evil Acorn. The cartridge is dual-format, allowing it to also run on the original Game Boy with some gameplay differences.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Pocket Tales&quot; follows the story of Conker as he retrieves his birthday presents and rescues his girlfriend Berri after they were stolen and she was kidnaped by the Evil Acorn. The game is played from a top-down perspective, with Conker exploring large environments in an attempt to find all his stolen presents. By collecting a certain number of presents in each area and defeating a boss, players unlock access to the next one. In addition to standard running and jumping, Conker can perform a mid-air ground-pounding attack that can hit buttons to solve puzzles. Conker also has the ability to dig up patches of soft dirt, emerging at another predetermined patch to reach inaccessible areas, and uses a slingshot to defeat enemies or hit distant switches. Puzzles are also solved by pushing blocks into grooves in the floor.

The game can be played on both Game Boy and Game Boy Color. However, the layout and some events in the game are different depending on the console it is played on. The game can be paused and saved anywhere when played on a Game Boy Color or later model, but can only be saved at specific save points when played on a non-color Game Boy.

==Development and release==
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Pocket Tales&quot; is the first Game Boy Color game that was developed by Rare. The game was released in 1999 for North America on June 8 and for Europe in July. Development began after the release of &quot;Donkey Kong Land III&quot; in 1997. Rare sought to make an action-adventure game in the vein of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, with a darker tone in the vein of gothic films. After seeing early versions of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, they decided to remove the gothic theme and replace it with a fantasy theme, with Conker as its main character. The entire score was composed by Robin Beanland, with Eveline Fischer programming it into the Game Boy. The game is the only game in the series to be intended for a family audience, as &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; had not switched its focus into an adult-oriented game at the time.

==Reception==
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Pocket Tales&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; considered it as one of the best Game Boy Color games at the time of its release. &quot;IGN&quot; contributor Adam Cleveland that while it was not a masterpiece, it still showed Rare as a leading developer in 8-bit titles. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; staff felt the game took full advantage of the Game Boy Color&#x27;s space in terms of graphics and gameplay. On the other hand, a disappointed Andrew Reiner of &quot;Game Informer&quot;, criticized the game as having &quot;insulting&quot; gameplay, a boring premise, and starring an &quot;annoying little squirrel&quot;.

The most enthusiastic reviews of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Pocket Tales&quot; highlighted its depth, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; calling it &quot;one huge adventure you&#x27;ve gotta play&quot;. &quot;Planet Game Boy&quot; magazine praised the game&#x27;s size and included minigames, stating that &quot;Pocket Tales&quot; is &quot;a real grower&quot; and that its lengthy lifespan of 20 hours &quot;will fly by&quot;. Similarly, &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; wrote that the game is &quot;far more engrossing than you&#x27;d expect it to be after [its] dismal start&quot;, highlighting its length, puzzles and exploration aspect. Staff from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised its length, number of mini-games, and a challenge level suitable for both young and experienced players. Conversely, &quot;Player One&quot;″s Carlito, opined that despite it being a decent action adventure title with &quot;funny action&quot; and a high number of levels, bosses and collectable weapons, the game was easy (especially with its repetitive puzzles) to the point of being beatable quickly. Dean Scott of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; found its gameplay too repetitive, as well as the environments and enemies too dull, for the player to be immersed in it.

Comparisons were frequently made to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, and many reviewers, even favorable ones, felt &quot;Conker&#x27;s Pocket Tales&quot; was not as good. Carlito called it as playable as &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, particularly with its controls. Reiner also acknowledged Conker&#x27;s movements and that there were &quot;noble and interesting&quot; design choices.

<text>Ragnvald Ulfsson the Old () was a jarl of Västergötland or Östergötland and was married to a sister of King Olav Tryggvason.

==Biography==
According to Snorri, Ragnvald was the son of jarl Ulf Tostesson. He was also the foster-son of Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker. Through his aunt Sigrid the Haughty, he was the cousin of Swedish King Olof Skötkonung. He was married to Ingeborg Tryggvasdotter, daughter of Tryggve Olavsson, son of Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf and grandson of King Harald Fairhair.
When Olaf Haraldsson became king of Norway in 1015, a war erupted with Sweden and Norwegians forces had pillaged in Västergötland. 
But then Norwegian King Olaf proposed to the Swedish princess Ingigerd Olofsdotter, the daughter of Sweden&#x27;s King Olof Skötkonung. This would result in peace and a royal alliance which would favor Ragnvald who was related to both parties.

However, at the Thing at Gamla Uppsala, Ragnvald and his foster-father Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker had to persuade King Olof Skötkonung to promise his daughter to King Olaf, whom he did not like. When the Swedish king failed to deliver his daughter, Ragnvald realized that he was in trouble. He has not only fallen out of grace with the Swedish king, but he could also expect the revenge of the Norwegians.

During a visit by the skald Sigvatr Þórðarson, Ragnvald learned that Prince Yaroslav I the Wise of Kievan Rus&#x27; had proposed to Ingigerd, and so he developed the idea that King Olaf should marry Astrid Olofsdotter, an illegitimate daughter of Olof Skötkonung, who was staying with Ragnvald. Sigvat promised to deliver the proposal and the Norwegian king accepted. Ragnvald delivered Astrid at Sarpsborg in Norway and she married the King Olaf after Christmas of 1019.

King Olof Skötkonung was now so upset that he intended to hang Ragnvald at the next Thing. However, when Ingigerd Olofsdotter married Yaroslav I the Wise, she received Staraja Ladoga (&quot;Aldeigjuborg&quot;) and Ingria (&quot;Ingermanland&quot;) as a wedding gift from Yaroslav. Ingigerd managed to arrange that Ragnvald became the jarl of both Staraja Ladoga and Ingria. Consequently Olof Skötkonung let Ragnvald depart with Ingigerd in the summer of 1019.

==Marriage==
Married to Ingeborg Tryggvasdotter. Children: 
#Uleb Ragnvaldsson Jarl
#Eilif Ragnvaldsson Jarl
#Ostrida Ragnvalsdatter

He has been considered to have fathered king Stenkil, with Astrid Nialsdotter from Norway. However this is based on later Icelandic sources, and the identification of Ragnvald with Ragnvald the Old of &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;.

==Saga sources==
Ragnvald is mentioned in the skaldic poem &quot;Austrfaravísur&quot;, ascribed to Sigvatr Þórðarson, skald of King Olaf Haraldsson of Norway (&quot;Olaf the Holy&quot;), who had been on a diplomatic mission to Sweden. This poem is quoted in the 13th century sagas &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; and Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. In addition to the poem, &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; only briefly mentions Ragnvald, while &quot;Heimskringla&quot; contains a more elaborate account of him. This 13th-century prose text is not considered historically reliable.
&quot;Fagrskinna&#x27;s&quot; account of Olaf the Holy&#x27;s betrothal to Ingigerd, and eventual wedding with Astrid, differs significantly from the account in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. In &quot;Fagrskinna&#x27;s&quot; account, Ragnvald is not given a prominent role in the proceedings.

<doc id="920522" wikidata="Q7205964" url="?curid=920522" title="Pneumatic filter">
<text>A pneumatic filter is a device which removes contaminants from a compressed air stream. This can be done using a number of different techniques and tools, such as a membrane that only allows air to pass through, or a &quot;media&quot; type that traps particulates but allows air to pass through to a Venturi tube.

== Usage ==
It is now common to have various stages of filtration employed in a filter-regulator-lubricator form factor, usually with the different filter housings connected. Air filtration applications are diverse and include end-user sectors such as cleanroom environments, biomedical, analytical instrumentation, food processing, marine and aviation, agriculture, manufacturing, food and beverage packaging and a host of other uses.

== Primary filters ==
Typical commercial pneumatic filters will remove particles as small as 5 micrometres from the air. The filters protect pneumatic devices from damage that would be caused by these contaminants. These contaminants include lubricant particles ejected by the compressor, dirt particles, small water droplets or aerosols.

== Secondary filters &amp; membrane air dryers == 
Secondary filters are used for a variety of applications and can remove particles as small as 50 nanometres in size. These secondary filters can remove fumes, odors, vapor, mist, moisture, oil, and tiny particles from the air stream. 

In addition, special &quot;point-of-use&quot; air drying devices (called membrane air dryers) may be used to depress the pressure dewpoint by selectively passing water vapor out of the compressed air stream as it passes through the inside hollows of a bundle of narrow, thinly-coated, membrane fibers. A small amount of &quot;sweep air&quot; must then be purged around the outside of the bundle of hollow fibers carrying the compressed air. Purge or &quot;sweep&quot; air is thus expanded (to atmospheric pressure) and subsequently vented to the atmosphere. The &quot;dryer&quot; purge air which is carried or swept along the outside of the hollow bundle of fibers creates a vapor pressure gradient between the &quot;wet&quot; compressed air on the inside the fibers and the &quot;dryer&quot; sweep air on the outside the bundle. This results in delivery of cleaner, dryer air before the compressed air is sent into any &quot;moisture-sensitive&quot; equipment(s). 

Membrane air dryers, however, may be easily damaged through any contact with liquid droplets (water or oil) so they should be protected with a high-efficiency coalescing (nano) air filter, positioned either immediately upstream (or integrated within) the membrane air dryer housing. Membrane dryers are primarily used with equipment&#x27;s that are especially sensitive to water vapor such as paint booths, two-part mixing equipment (polyurethane sealants), polyurethane dispensers, PUR-applicators (edge-banding equipment), laser-cutting machinery, CMM&#x27;s, industrial ink-jet printers, or even for laboratory use.

<doc id="920526" wikidata="Q2353128" url="?curid=920526" title="Silver ratio">
<text>In mathematics, the silver ratio is a geometrical proportion close to . Its exact value is the positive solution of the equation 

The name &quot;silver ratio&quot; results from analogy with the golden ratio, the positive solution of the equation 

Although its name is recent, the silver ratio (or silver mean) has been studied since ancient times because of its connections to the square root of 2, almost-isosceles Pythagorean triples, square triangular numbers, Pell numbers, the octagon, and six polyhedra with octahedral symmetry.

==Definition==
If the ratio of two quantities is proportionate to the sum of two and their reciprocal ratio, they are in the silver ratio: formula_1
The ratio formula_2 is here denoted 

Based on this definition, one has
formula_3

It follows that the silver ratio is found as the positive solution of the quadratic equation formula_4 The quadratic formula gives the two solutions formula_5 the decimal expansion of the positive root begins as .

Using the tangent function
:formula_6
or the hyperbolic sine
:formula_7

 is the superstable fixed point of the iteration formula_8

The iteration formula_9 results in the continued radical formula_10

==Properties==

The defining equation can be written
formula_11

The silver ratio can be expressed in terms of itself as fractions
formula_12

Similarly as the infinite geometric series
formula_13

For every integer one has
formula_14
From this an infinite number of further relations can be found.

Continued fraction pattern of a few low powers
formula_15

:formula_16

The silver ratio is a Pisot number, the next quadratic Pisot number after the golden ratio. By definition of these numbers, the absolute value formula_17 of the algebraic conjugate is smaller than thus powers of generate almost integers and the sequence formula_18 is dense at the borders of the unit interval.

 is the fundamental unit of real quadratic field formula_19

The silver ratio can be used as base of a numeral system, here called the &quot;sigmary scale&quot;. Every real number in can be represented as a convergent series
:formula_20 with weights 
Sigmary expansions are not unique. Due to the identities
formula_21
digit blocks formula_22 carry to the next power of resulting in formula_23 The number one has finite and infinite representations formula_24 and formula_25 where the first of each pair is in canonical form. The algebraic number can be written or non-canonically as The decimal number formula_26 formula_27 and formula_28

Properties of canonical sigmary expansions, with coefficients formula_29
* Every algebraic integer formula_30 has a finite expansion.
* Every rational number formula_31 has a purely periodic expansion.
* All numbers that do not lie in have chaotic expansions.
Remarkably, the same holds &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot; for all quadratic Pisot numbers that satisfy the general equation with integer It follows by repeated substitution of that all positive solutions formula_32 have a purely periodic continued fraction expansion formula_33
Vera de Spinadel described the properties of these irrationals and introduced the moniker metallic means.

==Pell sequences==


These numbers are related to the silver ratio as the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers are to the golden ratio.

The fundamental sequence is defined by the recurrence relation
formula_34
with initial values formula_35

The first few terms are 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169... . The limit ratio of consecutive terms is the silver mean.

Fractions of Pell numbers provide rational approximations of with error
formula_36

The sequence is extended to negative indices using formula_37

Powers of can be written with Pell numbers as linear coefficients formula_38 which is proved by mathematical induction on The relation also holds for 

The generating function of the sequence is given by
:formula_39

The characteristic equation of the recurrence is formula_40 with discriminant If the two solutions are silver ratio and conjugate so that formula_41 the Pell numbers are computed with the Binet formula
:formula_42 with the positive root of formula_43
Since formula_44 the number is the nearest integer to formula_45 with formula_46 and 

The Binet formula formula_47 defines the companion sequence formula_48

The first few terms are 2, 2, 6, 14, 34, 82, 198... .

This Pell-Lucas sequence has the Fermat property: if p is prime, formula_49 The converse does not hold, the least odd pseudoprimes formula_50 are 13, 385, 31, 1105, 1121, 3827, 4901.
Pell numbers are obtained as integral powers of a matrix with positive eigenvalue formula_51

formula_52

The trace of gives the above 

==Geometry==
===Silver rectangle and regular octagon===

A rectangle with edges in ratio can be created from a square piece of paper with an origami folding sequence. Considered a proportion of great harmony in Japanese aesthetics — &quot;Yamato-hi&quot; (大和比) — the ratio is retained if the rectangle is folded in half, parallel to the short edges. Rabatment produces a rectangle with edges in the silver ratio (according to ).
* Fold a square sheet of paper in half, creating a falling diagonal crease (bisect 90° angle), then unfold.
* Fold the right hand edge onto the diagonal crease (bisect 45° angle).
* Fold the top edge in half, to the back side (reduce width by ), and open out the triangle. The result is a rectangle.
* Fold the bottom edge onto the left hand edge (reduce height by ). The horizontal part on top is a silver rectangle.

If the folding paper is opened out, the creases coincide with diagonal sections of a regular octagon. The first two creases divide the square into a silver gnomon with angles in the ratios between two right triangles with angles in ratios (left) and (right). The unit angle is equal to degrees.

If the octagon has edge length its area is and the diagonals have lengths formula_53 and formula_54 The coordinates of the vertices are given by the permutations of formula_55 The paper square has edge length and area The triangles have areas formula_56 and formula_57 the rectangles have areas formula_58

===Silver whirl===

Divide a rectangle with sides in ratio into four congruent right triangles with legs of equal length and arrange these in the shape of a silver rectangle, enclosing a similar rectangle that is scaled by factor and rotated about the centre by Repeating the construction at successively smaller scales results in four infinite sequences of adjoining right triangles, tracing a whirl of converging silver rectangles.

The logarithmic spiral through the vertices of adjacent triangles has polar slope formula_59 The parallelogram between the pair of grey triangles on the sides has perpendicular diagonals in ratio , hence is a &quot;silver rhombus&quot;.

If the triangles have legs of length then each discrete spiral has length formula_60 The areas of the triangles in each spiral region sum to formula_61 the perimeters are equal to (light grey) and (silver regions).

Arranging the tiles with the four hypotenuses facing inward results in the diamond-in-a-square shape. Roman architect Vitruvius recommended the implied ratio as one of three for proportioning a town house &quot;atrium&quot;. The scaling factor is and iteration on edge length gives an angular spiral of length 

===Polyhedra===

The silver mean has connections to the following Archimedean solids with octahedral symmetry; all values are based on edge length 
* Rhombicuboctahedron
The coordinates of the vertices are given by 24 distinct permutations of formula_62 thus three mutually-perpendicular silver rectangles touch six of its square faces.
The midradius is formula_63 the centre radius for the square faces is 
* Truncated cube
Coordinates: 24 permutations of formula_64
Midradius: centre radius for the octagon faces: 
* Truncated cuboctahedron
Coordinates: 48 permutations of formula_65
Midradius: formula_66 centre radius for the square faces: for the octagon faces:

* Tetragonal trisoctahedron
* Trisoctahedron
* Hexakis octahedron

===Silver triangle===
The acute isosceles triangle formed by connecting two adjacent vertices of a regular octagon to its centre point, is here called the &quot;silver triangle&quot;. It is uniquely identified by its angles in ratios The apex angle measures each base angle degrees. It follows that the height to base ratio is formula_67

By trisecting one of its base angles, the silver triangle is partitioned into a similar triangle and an obtuse &quot;silver gnomon&quot;. The trisector is collinear with a medium diagonal of the octagon. Sharing the apex of the parent triangle, the gnomon has angles of formula_68 degrees in the ratios From the law of sines, its edges are in ratios formula_69

The similar silver triangle is likewise obtained by scaling the parent triangle in base to leg ratio , accompanied with an degree rotation. Repeating the process at decreasing scales results in an infinite sequence of silver triangles, which converges at the centre of rotation. It is assumed without proof that the centre of rotation is the intersection point of sequential median lines that join corresponding legs and base vertices.
The assumption is verified by construction, as demonstrated in the vector image.

The centre of rotation has barycentric coordinates
formula_70
the three whorls of stacked gnomons have areas in ratios
formula_71

The logarithmic spiral through the vertices of all nested triangles has polar slope
:formula_72 or an expansion rate of for every degrees of rotation.
The long, medium and short diagonals of the regular octagon concur respectively at the apex, the circumcenter and the orthocenter of a silver triangle.

===Silver rectangle and silver triangle===

Assume a silver rectangle has been constructed as indicated above, with height , length and diagonal length formula_73. The triangles on the diagonal have altitudes formula_74 each perpendicular foot divides the diagonal in ratio 

If an horizontal line is drawn through the intersection point of the diagonal and the internal edge of a rabatment square, the parent silver rectangle and the two scaled copies along the diagonal have areas in the ratios formula_75 the rectangles opposite the diagonal both have areas equal to formula_76

Relative to vertex , the coordinates of feet of altitudes and are
formula_77

If the diagram is further subdivided by perpendicular lines through and , the lengths of the diagonal and its subsections can be expressed as trigonometric functions of argument formula_78 degrees, the base angle of the silver triangle:
formula_79
:with 

Both the lengths of the diagonal sections and the trigonometric values are elements of biquadratic number field formula_80

The silver rhombus with edge has diagonal lengths equal to and The regular octagon with edge has long diagonals of length that divide it into eight silver triangles. Since the regular octagon is defined by its side length and the angles of the silver triangle, it follows that all measures can be expressed in powers of and the diagonal segments of the silver rectangle, as illustrated above, &quot;pars pro toto&quot; on a single triangle.

The leg to base ratio has been dubbed the &quot;Cordovan proportion&quot; by Spanish architect Rafael de la Hoz Arderius. According to his observations, it is a notable measure in the architecture and intricate decorations of the mediæval Mosque of Córdoba, Andalusia.

===Silver spiral===

A silver spiral is a logarithmic spiral that gets wider by a factor of for every quarter turn. It is described by the polar equation formula_81 with initial radius and parameter formula_82 If drawn on a silver rectangle, the spiral has its pole at the foot of altitude of a triangle on the diagonal and passes through vertices of paired squares which are perpendicularly aligned and successively scaled by a factor formula_83
===Ammann–Beenker tiling===

The silver ratio appears prominently in the Ammann–Beenker tiling, a non-periodic tiling of the plane with octagonal symmetry, build from a square and silver rhombus with equal side lengths. Discovered by Robert Ammann in 1977, its algebraic properties were described by Frans Beenker five years later.
If the squares are cut into two triangles, the inflation factor for Ammann A5-tiles is the dominant eigenvalue of substitution matrix formula_84

<text>Fabricius is a lunar impact crater that is located within the northeast part of the walled plain Janssen. Attached to the north-northwest rim is the slightly larger crater Metius. Fabricius has multiple central peaks that rise to 0.8 km, with a rugged rise to the northwest running north–south. The rim is lumpy and somewhat distended, most noticeably to the southwest and south. It is 78 kilometers in diameter and 2,500 meters deep. It is from the Eratosthenian period, 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago. It is named after David Fabricius, a 16th-century German astronomer.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fabricius.

A part of its statistical urban area, called Rönninge, is in Salem Municipality. The population is 35,311 (2005). The Swedish krona banknotes are printed by Crane AB at Tumba Bruk, in Tumba. Tumba is situated half-way between Stockholm and Södertälje and is considered a Stockholm suburb. In Tumba and Rönninge there are stations on the Stockholm commuter rail network.

Tumba also has a High School (Tumba gymnasium) with almost 1.000 students. The Alfa Laval company was founded in Tumba by Gustaf de Laval and remains in the suburb, as does DeLaval, split from Alfa Laval in 1991. Tumba is diverse, with high-rise apartment buildings and single-family houses. Tumba also has a shopping mall, Tumba Centrum, near the railway station.

The melodic death metal band Amon Amarth is from Tumba.

==History==
What makes Tumba different from the communities in northern Botkyrka is that it doesn’t stem from a big farm with historic roots. The people of prehistory preferred to live close to the shores. Tumba was an inland country. That’s why traces of human activity during prehistory are relatively rare. The big change took place during 1755 when the bank of Sweden bought a small farm and started a paper mill. Around the paper mill came a community that developed with its own school and houses for the workers to live in. The next big step was taken when the railroad came in 1860. Soon afterwards a society started to grow around the station house. This society had commerce, police, and a movie theatre. A few houses from that period are still left. In 1894 ‘Separator’ (DeLaval) bought Hamra gård and transformed it into a farm specialized in milk processing. It soon became a big industry. From the beginning these three parts were separate but grew together. The communities of both the papermill and Hamra are well kept.

<text>A mission critical (also mission essential) factor of a system is any factor (component, equipment, personnel, process, procedure, software, etc.) that is essential to business, organizational, or governmental operations. Failure or disruption of mission critical factors would have a serious impact on business, organization, or government operations, and can even cause social turmoil and catastrophes.

== Mission critical systems ==

A mission critical system is a system that is essential to the survival of a business or organization. When a mission critical system fails or is interrupted, business operations are significantly impacted. Mission essential equipment and mission critical application are also known as mission critical system.
Examples of mission critical systems are: an online banking system, railway/aircraft operating and control systems, electric power systems, and many other computer systems that will adversely affect business and society when they fail.

A good example of a mission critical system is a navigational system for a spacecraft. The difference between mission critical and business critical lies in the major adverse impact and the very real possibilities of loss of life, serious injury and/or financial loss.

There are four different types of critical systems: mission critical, business critical, safety critical and security critical. The key difference between a safety critical system and mission critical system, is that safety critical system is a system that, if it fails, may result in serious environmental damage, injury, or loss of life, while mission critical system may result in failure in goal-directed activity. An example of a safety critical system is a chemical manufacturing plant control system. Mission critical system and business critical system are similar terms, but a business critical system fault can influence only a single company or an organization and can partially stop lifetime activity (hours or days). Security critical system may lead to loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss. All these four systems are generalized as critical system.

As a rule in crisis management, if a triage-type decision is made in which certain components must be eliminated or delayed, e.g. because of resource or personnel constraints, mission critical ones must not be among them.

== Examples ==
Every business companies and organizations will have mission critical systems if they are functioning. A downed filtration system will cause the water filtration company to malfunction. In this case, the water filtration system is a mission critical system. If a gas system is downed, many restaurants and bakeries will have to shut down until the system functions well again. In this case, the gas system is a mission critical system. There are various other mission critical systems that, if they malfunction, will have serious impacts on other industries or organizations.

=== Navigating system of an aircraft ===
The aircraft is highly dependent on the navigating system. Air navigation is accomplished with many methods. Dead reckoning utilizes visual checkpoints along with distance and time calculations. The flight computer system aids the pilots to calculate the time and distance of the checkpoint that they set. The radio navigation aid (NAVAIDS) enables the pilots to navigate more accurately than dead reckoning alone, and in conditions of low visibility, radio navigation is handy. GPS is also used by pilots and uses 24 U.S. Department of Defence satellites to provide precise locational data, which includes speed, position, and track.

If two-way radio communication malfunctions, the pilots have to follow the steps in the Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91. Pneumatic system failure, the associated loss of altitude, and various unfamiliar situations may cause stress and loss of situational awareness. In this case, pilot should use instruments such as navigators to seek more information about the situational data. In this case, the malfunction of the navigation system would be mission critical and would cause serious consequences.

=== Nuclear reactor safety system ===
A nuclear reactor is a system that controls and contains the sustained nuclear chain reaction. It is usually used for generating electricity, but can also be used for conducting research and producing medical isotopes. Nuclear reactors have been one of the most concerning systems for public safety worldwide because the malfunction of a nuclear reactor can cause a serious disaster. Controlling the nuclear reactor system is accomplished by stopping, decreasing, or increasing the chain reaction inside the nuclear reactor. Varying the water level in the vertical cylinder and moving adjuster rods are the methods of controlling the chain reaction when the reactor is operating. Temperatures, reactor power levels, and pressure are constantly monitored by the sensitive detectors.

== History ==
The mission critical is a business&#x27;s quintessence and if failed, will cause serious financial and reputational damages. Today, as the companies develop and world becomes more web-based community, the range of mission critical has extended. But the mission critical computing has been evolving since the pre-Web era (before 1995). In the entirely text-based pre-web internet, gopher was one of the ASCII-based end-user programs. The mission critical system was basically used in transactional applications during this era. A business process management software, ERP, and airline reservation systems were usually mission critical. These applications were run on dedicated system in the data center. There were limited number of end users and usually accessed via terminals and personal computers.

After the pre-Web era, the Web era (1995 - 2010) rose. The range of mission critical increased to include electronic devices and web applications. More users were able to use to the internet and electronic devices, so larger number of end users were able to access increased mission critical applications. Therefore, the customers are expecting limitless availability and stronger security in the devices they are using. The businesses also start to become more web-based and this correspondingly increases the criminal associated with the money and fraud. This increase in range of mission critical made the security to become stronger and increased the security industries. Between 1995 and 2010, number of web users globally increased from 16 million to 1.7 billion. This shows increase in global reliance on web system.

After the Web era, consumerization era (2010 and beyond) has risen. The range of mission critical is even more increased due to increase in social, mobile, and customer-facing applications. The consumerization of IT became greater, organizations increased and web and IT availabilities to the people increased. Social business, customer service, and customer support applications have increased greatly, so mission critical was expanded further. According to Gartner, native PC projects will be outnumbered by mobile development projects by the ratio of 4:1. Therefore, today&#x27;s mission critical now encloses all subjects crucial for customer based service, business operation, employee productivity, and finance. The customers&#x27; expectations rose and small disruption can cause tremendous loss in the business. It was estimated that Amazon could have lost as much as $1,100 per second in net sales when it was suffering from an outage, and a five-minute outage of Google lost Google more than $545,000 . Failure in mission critical and even short time of outage can cause high price of downtime due to reputations damages. Longer periods of downtime of mission critical systems can result in even more serious problems to the industries or organizations.

== Safety &amp; security ==
Mission critical systems should remain very secured in all industries or organization using it. Therefore, the industries are using various security systems to avoid mission critical failures. Mainframes or workstations based companies are all dependent on database and process control, so database and process control would be mission critical for them. Hospital patient recording, call centers, stock exchanges, data storage centers, flight control tower, and many other industries that are dependent on communication system and computer should be protected from the shutdown of the system and they are considered mission critical. All the companies and industries are unavoidable to the unexpected or extraordinary problems that can cause shutdown to the mission critical. To avoid this, using the safety systems is considered very important part in the business.

=== Transport Layer Security (TLS) ===

The Transport Layer Security (TLS; formerly, Secure Socket Layers, SSL) refers to the standard security technology of networking protocol that controls and manages client and server authentication, and encrypt communication. This is usually used in the online transaction websites such as PayPal and Bank of America, which if systems are downed or hacked, will cause serious problems to the society and the companies themselves. In TLS, public-key and symmetric-key (encryption) are used together to secure the connection between two machines. Usually it is utilized in mail services or client machines that communicates via internet. To use this technology, the web server requires a digital certificate and this can be obtained through completing several questions about the identity of the website and get public keys and private keys (cryptographic keys). The industries using this technology may be also required to pay certain amount of money annually.

=== Shutdown systems ===
Nuclear power plants need safety systems to avoid mission-critical failures. The worst possible consequence that can result is leakage of radioactive materials (U-235 or Pu-239). One of the systems to avoid mission critical failures for nuclear power plants is shutdown system. It has two different forms: rod controls and safety injection control. When a problem occurs in the nuclear power plant, the rod control shutdown system drops the rods automatically and stops the chain reaction. The safety injection control injects liquid immediately when the system faces the problem in nuclear reactor and stops the chain reaction. Both systems are usually automatically operated, but also can be manually activated.

== Real time and mission critical ==
Real time and &quot;mission critical&quot; are often confused by many people but they are not the same concept.

=== Real time ===
Real time is responsiveness of a computer that makes the computer to continually update on external processes, and should process the procedure or information in a specified time, or could result in serious consequences. Video games are examples of real time since they are rendered by computer so rapidly, it is hard to notice the delay by the user. Each frame must be rendered in a short time to maintain the experience of interactivity. The speed of rendering graphics may vary according to the computer systems.

==== Types of real time systems ====
* Hard real-time system shouldn&#x27;t miss the specified time or can result in serious consequences. It is non-negotiable in timing and it is &quot;wrong answer&quot; if the deadline is missed. The example of hard real time system is airbags for cars.
* Soft real-time system has more loose deadline. The system can handle the problems and functions normally even though the deadline is missed, but their functionality depends on fast-paced processes. An example for soft-real time can be typing, which, if delayed, people will get annoyed, but answer still is correct. 
* Non real-time system doesn&#x27;t have certain or absolute deadlines. However, the throughput of the activity of performance can still be very essential.

=== Differences ===
Real time is a software that if specific time is not met, it fails, but mission critical is a system if failed, will result in catastrophic consequences. Although they go hand-in-hand, since real time can be mission critical, they are not the same concepts. These two are often confused by many people, but they are different concepts, but associated with each other.

==Mission critical personnel and mission critical systems planning==
===Social survival===
From the perspective of social function (i.e.: preserving society&#x27;s life support structure, and overall structure intact), Mission critical aspects of social function would necessitate the provision of basic needs for society. Such basic needs are often said to include food (this includes food production and distribution), water, clothing (not an immediate need in an emergency), sanitation (sewage is an immediate need, but physical waste/garbage/rubbish disposal is not an immediate need in an emergency), housing/shelter, energy (not immediate) and health needs (not immediate in a healthy population). The prior list is not exhaustive. Longer term needs might include communications/transport needs in a developed population. This list of needs is associated with mission critical personnel in a clear manner - food production requires farmers, food distribution requires transportation personnel, water requires water-infrastructure maintenance personnel (a long term requirement if existing water infrastructure has been maintained to a high standard), clothing tends to require individuals to maintain clothes production infrastructure, similarly for sanitation. In emergencies, housing/shelter requires someone to build the shelter and maintain it over the long term if necessary. Health needs are met by doctors, nurses and surgeons. Implicit use of infrastructure requires personnel to maintain that infrastructure also - so food transportation requires not only that there are drivers for food trucks, but also that (over the long term) there are highways maintenance personnel who can maintain the roads, traffic infrastructure and signs for the roads, this in turn requires power supply personnel to provide power for traffic lights, etc... In this light, mission-critical systems have a complex dependency network which enables analysis of the level of interconnected dependencies between different aspects of a mission-critical system, which can be useful in planning, or just for gaining a truthful picture of how mission criticality is organised in complex systems. This would enable the determination of &quot;choke points&quot; in a complex system, points at which a mission-critical system (or set of systems) is vulnerable in one sense or another. Ideas that relate to human resources and human resources planning (making use of Gantt charts for project management, etc...) are also relevant.

Mission criticality depends upon the timescale associated with basic needs or other deemed mission-critical factors. Over the medium term (often taken to be 10 years) and the long term (which can go into 50-60 year timescales), the planning for mission-critical systems will clearly differ from short-term mission-critical systems planning. Mission-critical personnel can be considered part of the mission-critical systems planning paradigm but require a different approach to technological or mechanical aspects of mission-critical systems (i.e.: they require human resources planning).

===Attributes of mission critical personnel===
Psychometrics enables the determination and characterisation of various psychological aspects of mission-critical personnel (e.g.: their IQ in the case of highly skilled work, such as nuclear physics, for example). Some jobs require physical standards (for instance, in the army), or physical dexterity (e.g.: surgeons). There exist methods and means of characterising the types of skills, qualities and other attributes that certain mission-critical job roles require, and these can be used as benchmarks for determining whether certain individuals are well suited to a particular mission-critical job role, or what assistance a less qualified (or even less capable) individual would need in performing a certain mission-critical job role which might be beyond their abilities (such measures might have to be taken in emergency situations).

<text> is an Aten near-Earth asteroid less than 20 meters in diameter crudely estimated to have passed roughly 6500 km above the surface of Earth on 31 March 2004.

It was only observed for 44 minutes on 31 March 2004, by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) team at Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico, and remains a lost asteroid. The estimated 4 to 6 meter sized body made one of the closest known approaches to Earth.

== Description ==
On 31 March 2004, around 15:35 UTC, the asteroid is crudely estimated to have passed within approximately 1 Earth radius () or 6,400 kilometers of the surface of the Earth (or 2.02  from Earth&#x27;s center). But due to the very short observation arc, the uncertainty in the close approach distance is a large ±15000 km. By comparison, geostationary satellites orbit at 5.6 and GPS satellites orbit at 3.17 from the center of the Earth.

 this was the third or fourth closest approach. The first observation of was not announced until 22 August 2004.

It was only observed four times in the space of 44 minutes and could not be followed up. Nevertheless, &quot;the orbit is quite determinate and, given the exceptional nature of this close approach, the object is now receiving a designation&quot;. No precovery images have been found.

 is estimated to be approximately 6 meters in diameter. This means that it would burn up from atmospheric friction before striking the ground in the case of an Earth impact.

On 26 March 2010, it may have come within 0.0825 AU (12.3 million km) of Earth, but with an uncertainty parameter of 9, the orbit is poorly determined.

Another, larger near-Earth asteroid, 2004 FH passed just two weeks prior to .

A closer non-impacting approach to Earth was not known until on 9 October 2008.

Albert was born in Hanover and showed early talent as a musician before embarking on the study of law in Göttingen in 1803. Experience in the Harz mountains awakened an interest in mining and, in 1806, he was appointed to the Mining and Forestry Office in Clausthal. By 1836 he was directing the entire mining industry of the Harz region.

In 1829, he observed, studied and reported the failure of iron mine hoist chains arising from repeated small loadings, the first recorded account of metal fatigue. He built a machine which repeatedly loaded a chain. His finding was that fatigue was not associated with an accidental overload, but was dependent on load and the number of repetitions of load cycles. 

He invented a twisted steel cable, later known as an &quot;Albert Rope&quot;, which was first used in the Clausthal &quot;Caroline&quot; mine in 1834 and was the forerunner of the modern wire rope. 

He died in Clausthal.

<text>Bow Creek is a long tidal estuary of the English River Lea and is part of the Bow Back Rivers. Below Bow Locks the creek forms the boundary between the London Boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets, in East London.
==History==
The River Lea rises in the town of Luton in Bedfordshire, and flows to the east and then the south to reach the River Thames at Leamouth. The final are known as Bow Creek, and follow a meandering route across a low-lying area formerly called Bromley Marsh, but now occupied by gas works and trading estates. The river is one of the oldest navigations in the country, but the creek is tidal, providing insufficient depth for navigation at low tide.

Use of the river for navigation is recorded in documents dating from 1190 and it became the first river in Britain where improvements were authorised by an act of Parliament, the River Lee Navigation Act 1425 (3 Hen. 6. c. 5). The River Lee Navigation Act 1571 (13 Eliz. 1. c. 18) allowed the Lord Mayor to make cuts and improvements to the river and to construct towing paths on both sides of it. This work is thought to have included a new cut between Old Ford and Bow Locks, which is known as Bow River and, like Bow Creek, is not subject to tolls for those using it. During the great plague of 1665, bargemen on the river continued to supply food to the population of London and were granted permission to navigate the Thames without having to ask a Thames Lighterman for assistance, in recognition of the risks they had taken.

Because of the importance of the river for navigation, the engineer John Smeaton was asked to survey it and to suggest how it could be improved in 1765. He produced a report in 1766, which recommended replacing the flash locks with more modern pound locks, and more significantly for Bow Creek, making a new cut from Bow tidal gates to the Thames at Limehouse. Although only a little further to the west, access at Limehouse avoided the long loop around the Isle of Dogs for traffic heading towards London. The cut was to be opened on 2 July 1770, but failure of a side wall delayed the event until September and a bridge collapsed into it in December. Traffic began to switch to the new cut, which was too narrow to allow barges to pass one another, and so a programme of widening it, which was completed in September 1777, was carried out. The channel now ends in Limehouse Basin.

Access to the new navigation, now known as the Lee Navigation, was still by tidal gates at Bow. There had been gates at the site since at least 1307, as a structure was erected by Henry de Bedyk during the reign of Edward I of England. The gates were rebuilt in 1573 by the owners of the tide mill, but the City of London appointed a surveyor to inspect the plans and a committee to oversee the work. Documents from 1588 suggest that the gates opened automatically when the incoming tide reached a level with the river above them. Another rebuilding took place in 1721, again by the tide mill owners, and with the City of London appointing a surveyor to oversee the work. Smeaton, in 1766, suggested that the gates should be replaced by a conventional pound lock, but this was not carried out. However, in 1852 a lock was constructed, although the gates also remained in place. The lock was rebuilt and shortened in 1900, and a second lock constructed beside it in 1931. Higher floodgates and walls were added in 2000 to prevent the inundation of the Lee Navigation when the level of the tide in the creek exceeded the level in the navigation.

Access from the creek to Bow Back Rivers was altered in the 1930s as part of an upgrade carried out to improve the waterways and to provide employment. The Prescott Channel was constructed to bypass the tide mills, and gave access from the creek to the Three Mills Wall River and the Waterworks River. The lock and sluice structure at the mouth of the new channel became disused in the 1960s and was subsequently removed, but a new structure capable of handling 350-tonne barges has been built as part of the upgrade to the waterways for the 2012 Summer Olympics, recreating a navigable connection between the creek and the Bow Back Rivers. The creek gave access to Abbey Creek and the Channelsea River, which connected to the old course of the River Lea near Hackney Marshes. Most of this waterway has since been culverted. Water also entered the creek through the sluices of the tide mills at Three Mills.

Ships were built at the Orchard House Yard, in the southern reaches at Leamouth, and launched in the creek where they could travel north along the River Lee Navigation or south to the River Thames. In 1810, an iron bridge was built spanning the creek – just south of the modern A13 bridge. The abutments have been reused for the pedestrian Jubilee Bridge.

<text>Janssen is an ancient impact crater located in the highland region near the southeastern lunar . The entire structure has been heavily worn and is marked by many lesser crater impacts. The outer wall is breached in multiple locations, but the outline of the crater rim can still be observed. The wall forms a distinctive hexagonal shape upon the rugged lunar surface, with a slight curvature at the vertices.

The crater is named after French astronomer Pierre Jules César Janssen.

The prominent crater Fabricius lies entirely within the outer wall, in the northeast quadrant of the floor. A number of other lesser, but still notable craters mark the crater floor. Connected to the northeast rim is Metius, and to the north is the heavily worn Brenner. Southeast of Janssen are the co-joined craters Steinheil and Watt. Astride the southwest wall is the smaller Lockyer. Further to the east, although appearing nearby due to elongation, is the huge Vallis Rheita.

In the southern two-thirds of Janssen can be discerned the remains of a large, concentric crater, the wall of which is overlaid by Fabricius. The floor of this inner depression contains a rille system named the Rimae Janssen. The rille curves from the rim of Fabricius to the southeast of the outer wall of Janssen, extending for a distance of up to 140 kilometers.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Janssen.

<doc id="920556" wikidata="Q4950608" url="?curid=920556" title="Bow Back Rivers">
<text>Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers is a complex of waterways between Bow and Stratford in east London, England, which connect the River Lea to the River Thames. Starting in the twelfth century, works were carried out to drain Stratford Marshes and several of the waterways were constructed to power watermills. Bow Creek provided the final outfall to the Thames, and the other channels were called Abbey Creek, Channelsea River, City Mill River, Prescott Channel, Pudding Mill River, Saint Thomas Creek, Three Mills Back River, Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River.

The rivers have been subject to change over centuries, with Alfred the Great diverting the river in 896 to create a second channel, and Queen Matilda bridging both channels around 1110 by paying for the construction of Bow Bridge.

Because the river system was tidal as far as Hackney Wick, several of the mills were tide mills, including those at Abbey Mills and those at Three Mills, one of which survives. Construction of the New River in the seventeenth century to supply drinking water to London, with subsequent extraction by waterworks companies, led to a lowering of water levels, and the river was gradually canalised to maintain navigation. Significant changes occurred with the creation of the Lee Navigation in 1767, which resulted in the construction of the Hackney Cut and the Limehouse Cut, allowing barges to bypass most of the back rivers. A major reconstruction of the rivers took place in the 1930s, authorised by the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. cxcii), but by the 1960s, commercial usage of the waterways had largely ceased. Deteriorating infrastructure led to the rivers dwindling to little more than tidal creeks, and they were categorised in 1968 as having no economic or long-term future.

However, British Waterways decided that their full restoration was an important aim in 2002, and the construction of the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and sluices which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site. It was hoped that significant amounts of materials for the construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge, but this did not happen. Improvements to the channels which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain.

==Name==
It is unclear when the individually named rivers became known collectively as Bow Back Rivers. Charles Tween, writing on behalf of the Lee Conservancy, referred to them as both the Stratford Back Rivers and the Stratford Back Streams in 1905. The section to the west of the more recent City Mills Lock was labelled Bow Back River on a map of 1895, but had previously been part of Pudding Mill River. Powell, writing in 1973, still referred to them as the Stratford Back Rivers.

The 1939 edition of &quot;Inland Waterways of Great Britain&quot;, an early attempt to provide a guide for the leisure use of canals, noted that the River Lee had &quot;several subsidiary canalised waterways&quot;, and listed Bow Creek, Old River Lee, City Mills River and Waterworks River, but did not describe them collectively. Boyes and Russell writing in 1977 referred to them as the Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers, and by the sixth edition of &quot;Inland Waterways of Great Britain&quot;, published in 1985, they were referred to as Bow Back Rivers.

The river which supplies the Bow Back Rivers has been known as the River Lee or River Lea, but modern usage tends to use &quot;Lea&quot; when referring to the natural river, and &quot;Lee&quot; when referring to the navigation, so that the Lee Navigation is a canalisation of the River Lea. The name Bow may derive from either an arched bridge over the River Lea in the 12th century or a bend in the road east of Bow Road station.

==History==

The Bow Back Rivers cross an area originally known as Stratford Marsh, an area of common Lammas land, where inhabitants had common rights to graze horses and cattle between Lammas Day (1 August) and Lady Day (25 March), but which was used for growing hay for the rest of the year. The Marsh was between Stratford-Langthorne and Stratford-at-Bow. Little remains from pre-history, but the names suggest that the two settlements lay at either end of a stone causeway across the marsh. Remains of a stone causeway have been found, but no traces of an associated road. The ford at Old Ford is of pre-Roman origin, part of a route from London to Essex which crossed Bethnal Green. In the Roman era, a new road was built from London to the ford, which carried the principal road to Colchester. There may also have been a ford further south at Bow, and a further causeway existed between Homerton and Leyton, known as &quot;Wanstead Slip&quot;.

These crossings passed across a true marsh, either side of the River Lea. This wide, fast flowing river was then tidal as far as Hackney Wick, and navigable as far as Hertfordshire. Dates for the earliest use of the rivers by boats are unknown, although a late Bronze Age dugout canoe and parts of a Saxon barge have been found in the marshes at Walthamstow. The first alteration to the natural river may have been made by Alfred the Great, who cut another channel to strand a force of Danes in 896, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. This lowered the tide head to Old Ford, and prevented large boats sailing the river until the 15th century.
During the reign of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), directed that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee and the other to cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that &quot;arch&quot; was derived from &quot;arcus&quot;, meaning &quot;bow&quot;. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.

In 1135, Stratford Langthorne Abbey was founded. The Abbey continued the process of draining Stratford marsh begun in the Middle Ages and creating artificial channels to drive water and tide mills. A small river port developed at Stratford, mentioned in the 15th century, to serve the needs of Stratford Abbey and the mills at Stratford, and there is similar evidence in later centuries. The Abbey took on responsibility to maintain the marsh walls around Bow Creek, to keep the tidal waters out. The river was being used for the transport of goods and passengers by 1571, when an act of Parliament, the River Lee Navigation Act 1571 (13 Eliz. 1. c. 18), empowered the Lord Mayor of London to make improvements to the river to ensure that supplies of grain continued to reach the capital. These works included a new cut near the Thames, probably the section of river between Bow Tidal Gates and Old Ford, on which no tolls were to be charged, and a pound lock was constructed at Waltham Abbey, only the second to be built in England.

Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge there were three others, said in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the cutting of mill streams through Maud&#x27;s causeway, although there is evidence that the mills pre-dated the causeway. However, the mill owners took responsibility for the bridges, which crossed the mill streams for St Thomas&#x27;s, Spileman&#x27;s and Saynes mills. The last two were owned by the City of London, and the bridges were called Pegshole and St Michael&#x27;s Bridges. An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility for St Thomas&#x27;s Bridge, but the miller did not complain as Pegshole bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain. The names were eventually swapped, and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933, which crossed the widened Three Mills Wall River, the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three Mills Wall River, while Three Mills Wall Back River was filled in.

Crossing the Back Rivers by a series of low-level bridges is the Northern Outfall Sewer which leads to the Abbey Mills Pumping Station, both of which were designed by Joseph Bazalgette in the 1860s. Today, the route of the embankment that encloses the sewer from Bow to Beckton is followed by a public footpath, The Greenway.

===Public water supply===
Water was extracted from the rivers to provide a public water supply. The opening of the New River in 1633, a channel built to bring water to London from Amwell springs, and soon afterwards from the River Lea near Ware, had a detrimental effect on both navigation and milling by reducing water levels. Around 1745, the West Ham Waterworks Company built a waterworks at Saynes Mill in Stratford, the river on which it was located later being known as Waterworks River. The East London Waterworks Company was set up in 1807, and built works at Old Ford, where they extracted water from the river. The supply to the works was moved further upstream in 1829, and in 1830 they built a canal, running parallel to the Hackney Cut, so that water could be obtained from Lea Bridge. Much of the work was carried out by the contractor William Hoof, who had gained a reputation as a specialist tunnelling contractor, after working on Strood Tunnel for the Thames and Medway Canal and Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal. He worked on the waterworks project from 1829 until 1834. Where there had been a reservoir to the south of the Middlesex Filter Beds weir in 1850, maps from 1870 show the site occupied by a waterworks, and the canal which supplied the Old Ford works running beside the Hackney Cut. Another large reservoir, triangular in shape, was located between the old river and the Hackney Cut at Old Ford, with two connections to the old river. The water supply canal passed under the old river to feed two compensation reservoirs to the north of the Great Eastern Railway tracks. A covered reservoir was situated on the west bank of the old river.

The Waterworks River underwent considerable change over the years. In 1850, it left the channel of the Old River Lee much further to the north, to the south-west of Temple Mills railway depot. It was called Lead Mills Stream at this point. Near Temple Mills bridge, now on the A12 road, Channelsea River split off. The two channels ran parallel to the Old River Lee, before Channelsea River turned to the south-east. There was another small connection between the Old River Lee and the Waterworks River called Bully Fence, where the northern Channelsea River is shown on modern maps. By 1870, it was called Waterworks River as far north as Temple Mills depot, and by 1896, its present connection to the old river near to Carpenters Road had been established. Twenty years later, the northern Waterworks River rejoined the Lee at Bully Fence, and the section between there and Carpenters Road had been filled in. At some point, the connection at Bully Fence became the main source for the Channelsea River, although the 1953/66 map still shows it connected to the remnants of the system to the north, for drainage. Administrative boundaries still follow the northern course of the Waterworks River.

===Navigation===
Although the River Lee was navigable up to Hertford, this had been achieved by the use of flash locks, where a single gate created a channel through a weir. These caused conflict between the bargemen and the millers, since operation of the lock lowered the water level above it, hindering the operation of the mill. In 1765, the engineer John Smeaton was asked to survey the river, with a view to improving it &quot;for the good of the public&quot;. His report of September 1766 highlighted the need to replace the flash locks with the more modern pound locks or pen sluices, each with two sets of gates. Significantly for the Bow Back Rivers, he suggested a new cut from Lea Bridge to Old Ford, and another from Bow Tidal Gates to a basin at Limehouse. The first became known as the Hackney Cut, and the second as the Limehouse Cut. An act of Parliament, the River Lee Navigation Act 1767 (7 Geo. 3. c. 51), was obtained on 29 June 1767, and work began.

The Limehouse Cut would give direct access to the River Thames, avoiding the tidal Bow Creek. It was expected to open in July 1770, but some of the brickwork collapsed, and had to be repaired before the cut opened on 17 September 1770. It closed again briefly in December, when a bridge collapsed into it, and it was soon decided that it was too narrow, and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length. This work was finished on 1 September 1777. The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768, and a bricklayer called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on the cut on 23 April 1768. A millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper was given the job of building Bromley Lock (close to Bow tidal gates). Work progressed quickly, and the cut was opened for traffic on 7 August 1769.

The River Lee Navigation Act 1767 had specified points on the river at which tolls could be collected, but had made no mention of tolls for use of Bow Creek, Bow Back Rivers, or the section of the navigation between Bow tidal gates and Old Ford, and these had remained toll-free. An act of Parliament, the Lee Navigation Improvement Act 1850 (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. cix), obtained on 14 August 1850 allowed the trustees to build a pound lock at Bow tidal gates. To prevent opposition from the bargees, the act had formalised the freedom from tolls on the Bow River section. Once the lock was built, however, the trustees charged a toll for using it. This was unpopular, but there was still the option of using the tidal gates at certain states of the tide, which did not incur a toll. A clause to authorise the lock toll was deleted by Parliament from a subsequent act, the Lee Conservancy Act 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. cliv), and it was still the case in 1977 that a charge was made for using the lock but not for using the gates.
By 1821, Stratford was served by a number of wharves, some located on the Lea and others on the Channelsea River or other branches. In addition to wharves for general goods, some specifically handled timber, chalk, stone, coal, or wheat. Several of the factories and mills had private wharves. By this date, a dock had been built near Bow Bridge to the south of the High Street. It was about , and was connected to the river by its own channel. It was initially called Stratford Dock, later becoming Meggs Dock and was probably constructed by the &quot;Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust&quot;. Half of it had been filled in by 1896, and the rest by 1920.

In the 1860s, the income from the navigation had dropped, as a result of attempts to compete against the railways, but economies were made, and capital works continued. The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by the Lee Navigation Improvement Act 1805 (45 Geo. 3. c. lxix). Although the original Lee trustees, and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain them, since they did not generate any revenue. Nor could they be closed, since they allowed surplus water from the upper river to reach the Thames, without causing flooding.

===Regeneration===
The rivers were run down by the 1920s and, with high unemployment in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition to work on the channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An act of Parliament was obtained to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief, &amp;c.) Act 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. cxcii), and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated to the west of the junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.
Prior to the work, the arrangement had been to regulate the navigation with the Pond Lane Flood Gates and Marshgate Lane tidal lock. The new lock at Carpenter&#x27;s Road gave access to the Waterworks River, providing barge access to Temple Mills. At high tides, the low headroom of the Northern Outfall Sewer aqueduct prevented access to the southern reaches of the system, and to allow access City Mill Lock was constructed near Blaker Road. In 2005, the lock was partially restored as part of the planning gain required from the developers of the adjacent Bellamy Homes housing scheme.

The 1930s improvements included the construction of the Prescott Channel, designed to allow flood water to bypass the Three Mills tide mills. The channel included sluices to regulate water levels above it, but these became redundant once the tide mills ceased to operate, and eventually seized up. They were removed soon after parts of the Channelsea River were culverted.

By the 1960s, only the Saint Thomas Creek, the City Mills River and the Channelsea River were still being used for commercial traffic. A section of the Channelsea River between Stratford High Street and Lett Road was culverted between 1957 and 1958. As traffic ceased, the lock structures deteriorated, and by 2006, City Mills Lock and Carpenters Road Lock were officially disused. The Transport Act 1968 had classified most waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those for which the government of the time could see no economic future, and which would only therefore be subject to maintenance to prevent them becoming unsafe. The Bow Back Rivers fell into this category, and remained neglected until their full restoration was enshrined in a British Waterways policy document in 2002.

==Olympics==

The Olympic Stadium for the London 2012 Summer Olympics is constructed on former industrial land between the Lea Navigation to the west and the City Mill River to the east. The land was formerly bisected by the remains of the Pudding Mill River, but this was filled in to provide a site which was large enough. As part of the construction phase for the event, Three Mills Lock was constructed on the Prescott Channel. This consists of a barge lock, suitable for barges, and an adjacent sluice, which enables the water levels above the structure to be regulated, rather than navigation being subject to the tides. The lock was built to allow construction materials to be delivered to the site and spoil to be removed, and the final cost was £23 million, which included a sluice on the Three Mills Wall River. Work began in March 2007, and the project lasted for just over two years. Despite hopes that it would transport 1.75 million tonnes while the stadium was being built, very little commercial traffic used the new lock.

With water levels above the structure remaining fairly constant, £400,000 was spent on refurbishing City Mills Lock. Although some work had been carried out in 2006, including the fitting of new metal gates, it was not operational, and had not been used for around 40 years. The second phase of restoration included fitting the equipment to automate its operation. The first public use of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010. British Waterways hoped to restore the Carpenters Road Lock soon afterwards, but the project was postponed until after the completion of the Olympic games, as temporary &#x27;Land Bridges&#x27; were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium, some of which will be removed after the event. Following the Olympic games, it is hoped the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft.

The Olympic Delivery Authority took the decision to culvert more of the Channelsea River, where it crossed the northern part of the site. It remains a designated main river, and so they had to liaise with the Environment Agency on matters of flood-risk management, and a site was identified which would provide compensation for the loss of habitat caused by the culverting. Much of the old River Lea was inaccessible to the public prior to the project, but is a central feature of the northern parklands that have been created. Two &#x27;wetland bowls&#x27; were designed, which have been planted with water-loving plants such as reeds, rushes, sedges and iris. They also provide spawning grounds and refuges during flood conditions for fish, as well as providing storage capacity for flood water. It was the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain when it was completed, and most of the 350,000 plants were grown in Norfolk from seeds and cuttings removed from the site. At the southern end of the site, the Waterworks River was reconstructed. Improvements in the 1930s created channels with vertical concrete sides, and little thought for habitat. The channel was made wider, with sloping banks and ramps down to the water&#x27;s edge, and was improved visually and ecologically by the planting of aquatic marginal plants.

Following the Olympics, there was extremely limited access to the waterways through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and reconstruction of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to rebuild it and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards the cost of the project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August. Public access to the waterways around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.

<text>The River Irk is a river in the historic county of Lancashire in North West England that flows through the northern part of Greater Manchester. It rises to the east of Royton and runs west past Chadderton, Middleton and Blackley before merging with the River Irwell, a tributary of the River Mersey, in the centre of Manchester. 

==History==
The Irk&#x27;s name is of obscure etymology, but may be Brittonic in origin and related to the Welsh word &quot;iwrch&quot;, meaning roebuck. The Afon Iwrch, a river in Denbighshire, also takes its name from this word.

In medieval times, there was a mill by the Irk at which the tenants of the manor ground their corn and its fisheries were controlled by the lord of the manor. In the 16th century, throwing carrion and other offensive matter into the Irk was forbidden. Water for Manchester was drawn from the river before the Industrial Revolution. A bridge over the Irk was recorded in 1381. The river was noted for destructive floods. In 1480, the burgesses of Manchester described the highway between Manchester and Collyhurst which &quot;the water of Irk had worn out&quot;. In 1816, of seven bridges over the Irk, six were liable to be flooded after heavy rain but the seventh, the Ducie Bridge completed in 1814 was above flood levels.

According to &quot;The New Gazetteer of Lancashire&quot; (1830) the Irk had &quot;more mill seats upon it than any other stream of its length in the Kingdom&quot; and &quot;the eels in this river were formerly remarkable for their fatness, which was attributed to the grease and oils expressed by the mills from the woollen cloths and mixed with the waters.&quot; However, by the start of the 20th century the Irk Valley between Crumpsall and Blackley had been left a neglected river, &quot;not only the blackest but the most sluggish of all rivers&quot;.

Friedrich Engels described the banks of the Irk in Manchester at the height of the city&#x27;s industrial excess.

The river has since been culverted as it reaches the city centre. It disappears beneath Manchester Victoria railway station into a brick tunnel at Ducie Bridge and empties into the Irwell beneath a railway viaduct.

On 15 August 1953, the front coach of a Manchester to Bury electric train fell from the viaduct over the River Irk after colliding with a local steam train. Ten people were killed and 58 injured in what became known as the Irk Valley Junction disaster.

<text>Tumba Bruk was the printing company responsible for the manufacturing of the Swedish krona banknotes. The company was founded by Sveriges Riksbank in 1755 to produce banknotes, making it the world&#x27;s oldest factory of its kind. In 2002, the company was sold to the current owner, banknote paper supplier Crane &amp; Co. It is located in Tumba, close to Stockholm. The facility and its park were designated a listed building in 2001.

== Background ==
In 1661, Sweden&#x27;s first banknotes were produced by Stockholm Banco, which were used as credit notes for its customers. These notes soon became worthless, however, when Stockholm Banco went bankrupt in 1668, and banknotes were subsequently prohibited.

Banknotes received a second chance in 1701 when the predecessor to Sveriges Riksbank started handing out &quot;transportsedlar,&quot; notes that worked in a similar way to modern cheques. These notes were easily forged since the paper used for the production of the notes was imported, and these transports were often hijacked. In order to combat this, King Adolf Frederick ordered the construction of a proper paper production facility on the grounds of present-day Tumba Bruk on 23 June 1755. Paper production on a smaller scale had been going on since 1750.

<doc id="920575" wikidata="Q298860" url="?curid=920575" title="Hippasus">
<text>Hippasus of [[Metapontum]] (; , &quot;Híppasos&quot;; c. 530 – c. 450 BC) was a Greek philosopher and early follower of Pythagoras. Little is known about his life or his beliefs, but he is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers. The discovery of irrational numbers is said to have been shocking to the Pythagoreans, and Hippasus is supposed to have drowned at sea, apparently as a punishment from the gods for divulging this and crediting it to himself instead of Pythagoras which was the norm in Pythagorean society. However, the few ancient sources who describe this story either do not mention Hippasus by name (e.g. Pappus) or alternatively tell that Hippasus drowned because he revealed how to construct a dodecahedron inside a sphere. The discovery of irrationality is not specifically ascribed to Hippasus by any ancient writer.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Hippasus. He may have lived in the late 5th century BC, about a century after the time of Pythagoras. Metapontum in Magna Graecia is usually referred to as his birthplace, although according to Iamblichus (3rd century AD) some claim Metapontum to be his birthplace, while others the nearby city of Croton. Hippasus is recorded under the city of Sybaris in Iamblichus&#x27;s list of each city&#x27;s Pythagoreans. He also states that Hippasus was the founder of a sect of the Pythagoreans called the &quot;Mathematici&quot; () in opposition to the &quot;Acusmatici&quot; (); but elsewhere he makes him the founder of the &quot;Acusmatici&quot; in opposition to the &quot;Mathematici&quot;.

Iamblichus says about the death of Hippasus:
:It is related to Hippasus that he was a Pythagorean, and that, owing to his being the first to publish and describe the sphere from the twelve pentagons, he perished at sea for his impiety, but he received credit for the discovery, though really it all belonged to HIM (for in this way they refer to Pythagoras, and they do not call him by his name).

According to Iamblichus&#x27;s &quot;The life of Pythagoras&quot;,
:There were also two forms of philosophy, for the two genera of those that pursued it: the &quot;Acusmatici&quot; and the &quot;Mathematici&quot;. The latter are acknowledged to be Pythagoreans by the rest but the Mathematici do not admit that the Acusmatici derived their instructions from Pythagoras but from Hippasus. The philosophy of the Acusmatici consisted in auditions unaccompanied with demonstrations and a reasoning process; because it merely ordered a thing to be done in a certain way and that they should endeavor to preserve such other things as were said by him, as divine dogmas. Memory was the most valued faculty. All these auditions were of three kinds; some signifying what a thing is; others what it especially is, others what ought or ought not to be done. (p. 61)

==Doctrines==
Aristotle speaks of Hippasus as holding the element of fire to be the cause of all things; and Sextus Empiricus contrasts him with the Pythagoreans in this respect, that he believed the &quot;arche&quot; to be material, whereas they thought it was incorporeal, namely, number. Diogenes Laërtius tells us that Hippasus believed that &quot;there is a definite time which the changes in the universe take to complete, and that the universe is limited and ever in motion.&quot; According to one statement, Hippasus left no writings, according to another he was the author of the &quot;Mystic Discourse&quot;, written to bring Pythagoras into disrepute.

A scholium on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; notes him as an early experimenter in music theory, claiming that he made use of bronze disks to discover the fundamental musical ratios, 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1.

===Irrational numbers===
Hippasus is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers, following which he was drowned at sea. Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of integers, and the discovery of irrational numbers is said to have shocked them. However, the evidence linking the discovery to Hippasus is unclear.

Pappus (4th century AD) merely says that the knowledge of irrational numbers originated in the Pythagorean school, and that the member who first divulged the secret perished by drowning. Iamblichus (3rd century AD) gives a series of inconsistent reports. In one story he explains how a Pythagorean was merely expelled for divulging the nature of the irrational; but he then cites the legend of the Pythagorean who drowned at sea for making known the construction of the regular dodecahedron in the sphere. In another account he tells how it was Hippasus who drowned at sea for betraying the construction of the dodecahedron and taking credit for this construction himself; but in another story this same punishment is meted out to the Pythagorean who divulged knowledge of the irrational. Iamblichus clearly states that the drowning at sea was a punishment from the gods for impious behaviour.

These stories are usually taken together to ascribe the discovery of irrationals to Hippasus, but whether he did or not is uncertain. In principle, the stories can be combined, since it is possible to discover irrational numbers when constructing dodecahedra. Irrationality, by infinite reciprocal subtraction, can be easily seen in the golden ratio of the regular pentagon.

Some scholars in the early 20th century credited Hippasus with the discovery of the irrationality of formula_1, the square root of 2. Plato in his &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, describes how Theodorus of Cyrene (c. 400 BC) proved the irrationality of formula_2, formula_3, etc. up to formula_4, which implies that an earlier mathematician had already proved the irrationality of formula_1. Aristotle referred to the method for a proof of the irrationality of formula_1, and a full proof along these same lines is set out in the proposition interpolated at the end of Euclid&#x27;s Book X, which suggests that the proof was certainly ancient. The method is a proof by contradiction, or reductio ad absurdum, which shows that if the diagonal of a square is assumed to be commensurable with the side, then the same number must be both odd and even.

In the hands of modern writers this combination of vague ancient reports and modern guesswork has sometimes evolved into a much more emphatic and colourful tale. Some writers have Hippasus making his discovery while on board a ship, as a result of which his Pythagorean shipmates toss him overboard; while one writer even has Pythagoras himself &quot;to his eternal shame&quot; sentencing Hippasus to death by drowning, for showing &quot;that formula_1 is an irrational number&quot;.

<text>3D audio effects are a group of sound effects that manipulate the sound produced by stereo speakers, surround-sound speakers, speaker-arrays, or headphones. This frequently involves the virtual placement of sound sources anywhere in three-dimensional space, including behind, above or below the listener.

3-D audio (processing) is the spatial domain convolution of sound waves using head-related transfer functions. It is the phenomenon of transforming sound waves (using head-related transfer function or HRTF filters and cross talk cancellation techniques) to mimic natural sounds waves, which emanate from a point in a 3-D space. It allows trickery of the brain using the ears and auditory nerves, pretending to place different sounds in different 3-D locations upon hearing the sounds, even though the sounds may just be produced from only two speakers (dissimilar to surround sound).

==Complete 3D positional audio==
Using head-related transfer functions and reverberation, the changes of sound on its way from the source (including reflections from walls and floors) to the listener&#x27;s ear can be simulated. These effects include localization of sound sources behind, above and below the listener.

Some 3D technologies also convert binaural recordings to stereo recordings.

3D Positional Audio effects emerged in the 1990s in PC and video game consoles. 3D audio techniques have also been incorporated in music and video-game style music video arts.

True representation of the elevation level for 3D loudspeaker reproduction become possible by the Ambisonics and wave field synthesis (WFS) principle.

==3-D audio presentations==
Some amusement parks have created attractions based around the principles of 3-D audio. One example is &quot;Sounds Dangerous!&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Guests wear special earphones as they watch a short film starring comedian Drew Carey. At a point in the film, the screen goes dark while a 3-D audio sound-track immerses the guests in the ongoing story. To ensure that the effect is heard properly, the earphone covers are color-coded to indicate how they should be worn. This is not a generated effect but a binaural recording.

Nick Cave&#x27;s novel &quot;The Death of Bunny Munro&quot; was recorded in audiobook format using 3D audio.

The song &quot;Propeller Seeds&quot; by English artist Imogen Heap was recorded using 3D audio.

There have been developments in using 3D audio for DJ performances including the world&#x27;s first Dolby Atmos event on 23 January 2016 held at Ministry of Sound, London. The event was a showcase of a 3D audio DJ set performed by Hospital Records owner Tony Colman aka London Elektricity.

Other investigations included the Jago 3D Sound project which is looking at using Ambisonics combined with STEM music containers created and released by Native Instruments in 2015 for 3D nightclub sets.

== Fighter jet aircraft ==
In November 2024 it was announced that the US Air Force had awarded a $9 million contract to Danish defense company Terma A/S, to supply its 3-D audio system for the F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft, with a program of upgrades over the next two years. The system will provide high-fidelity digital audio by spatially separating radio signals, aligning audio with threat directions, and integrating active noise reduction.

<doc id="920586" wikidata="Q1454954" url="?curid=920586" title="Langrenus (crater)">
<text>Langrenus is an impact crater located near the eastern lunar limb. The feature is circular in shape, but appears oblong due to foreshortening. It lies on the eastern shore of the Mare Fecunditatis. To the south is the overlapping crater pair Vendelinus and the smaller Lamé.

The inner wall of Langrenus is wide and irregularly terraced, with an average width of about 20 kilometers. The outer ramparts are irregular and hilly, and there is a bright, fragmented ray system spread across the mare to the west. The interior of the crater has a higher albedo than the surroundings, so the crater appears bright when the Sun is overhead. The crater floor is covered by many boulders, and is slightly irregular in the northwest half. The central peaks rise about a kilometer above the floor, and a peak on the eastern rim ascends to an altitude of 3 km.

On December 30, 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris observed a series of glows on the floor of this crater using the one-meter telescope. These glows changed form with time, and Dollfus expressed the belief that this was likely a gaseous emission. The cracked floor of the crater may have been the source of the gas.

Flemish astronomer Michael van Langren was the first person to draw a lunar map while giving names to many of the features, in 1645. He named this crater after himself; it is the only one of his named features that has retained his original designation.

Langrenus is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Langrenus.

Many of the more significant associated craters that surround Langrenus have since been renamed by the IAU.

* Langrenus A — &quot;See&quot; Barkla.
* Langrenus B — &quot;See&quot; Naonobu.
* Langrenus C — &quot;See&quot; Acosta.
* Langrenus D — &quot;See&quot; Al-Marrakushi.
* Langrenus F — &quot;See&quot; Bilharz.
* Langrenus J — &quot;See&quot; Somerville.
* Langrenus K — &quot;See&quot; Atwood.

<text>MacMillan is a bowl-shaped lunar impact crater on the eastern fringes of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after American mathematician and astronomer William Duncan MacMillan. It is located just to the southwest of a lone rise, near the southwestern edge of the Montes Archimedes. This is a cup-shaped depression in the surface with an interior albedo that matches the nearby lunar mare. The edges of the rim have a somewhat higher albedo. It shows some indications of a concentric crater.

This crater was previously identified as Archimedes F.

<doc id="920596" wikidata="Q15055070" url="?curid=920596" title="Marshal of the air force">
<text>Marshal of the air force or marshal of the air is a five-star rank (or NATO equivalent OF-10) and an English-language term for the most senior rank in some air forces. It is usually the direct equivalent of a general of the air force in other air forces, a field marshal or general of the army in many armies, or a naval admiral of the fleet.

The rank originated in the British Royal Air Force (RAF), in which the most senior rank remains Marshal of the RAF. Several other Commonwealth air forces and others that have been influenced by the practices of the RAF (especially in the Middle East) have similar names for the most senior rank, such as Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). There is sometimes confusion with the next most senior ranks in such cases: air chief marshal and air marshal (proper). The rank of Marshal of the RAF existed on paper from 1919; the first person to hold the rank was Lord Hugh Trenchard, from 1927. In the UK the rank has often been held by the most senior, actively-serving RAF officer, whereas in other Commonwealth countries the equivalent rank has been purely ceremonial or honorary in function. (For example, the rank of Marshal of the RAAF has been held only by a monarch or consort.)

In Portuguese the equivalent air force ranks are &quot;Marechal do Ar&quot; (lit. &quot;Marshal of the Air&quot;) in Brazil, or &quot;Marechal&quot; in Portugal, both of which are sometimes translated as &quot;marshal of the air force&quot;. In the past, a similar name has been used for the most senior rank in Italian air forces.

A holder of several senior ranks in the Indonesian air force (&quot;Tentara Nasional Indonesia-Angkatan Udara&quot;; TNI-AU), may be referred to as a &quot;marsekal di TNI-AU&quot; (lit. &quot;marshal of the TNI-AU&quot;). The most senior rank is &quot;Marsekal Besar&quot; (&quot;Grand Marshal&quot;) is sometimes translated as &quot;marshal of the air force&quot;.

In Nazi Germany, the most senior rank of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (a rank that was also used by the German Army). While the commander of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, Hermann Göring was the only person to hold the more senior rank of &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot;, this rank could technically have been bestowed on any senior officer of the Heer (army), Kriegsmarine (navy) and Luftwaffe, which together comprised the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

While the air forces of the former Soviet Union had ranks named chief marshal of the aviation branch (or &quot;chief marshal of the air force&quot;) and marshal of the aviation branch (or &quot;marshal of the air force&quot;), these were four-star and three-star ranks, respectively (and therefore equivalent to the less senior RAF ranks of Air Chief Marshal and Air Marshal respectively).

==Seniority==
A marshal of the air force can be properly considered equivalent to an army marshals or field marshal in many countries, as well as the naval rank of admiral of the fleet. That is, marshal of the air force is a five-star rank and in NATO countries it is described by the ranking code of OF-10. As such a senior rank, it is very seldom held. It is awarded either in a ceremonial capacity to Heads of State or members of Royal Families, or to the most Senior Officers in large Air Forces.

In the Air Force of Australia, India, Thailand and the United Kingdom, &quot;Marshals of the Air Force&quot; are immediately senior to Air Chief Marshals. In the case of New Zealand, although the rank of Marshal of the Royal New Zealand Air Force has been bestowed, no Royal New Zealand Air Force officer has attained higher rank than Air Marshal and the New Zealand rank of Air Chief Marshal only exists on paper. A similar situation to the one in New Zealand also existed in Malaysia until the 1970s when the Royal Malaysian Air Force replaced its air-officer ranks with general-officer ranks, although it retained the rank of Marshal of the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The rank of Marshal of the Royal Canadian Air Force was never granted.

During Germany&#x27;s Nazi period, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (Air Force), in common with the &quot;Heer&quot; (Army), used the rank of &quot;generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal), which was equivalent to &quot;großadmiral&quot; (Grand Admiral) in the Navy. &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; was immediately senior to &quot;generaloberst&quot; (Colonel General) and it was the most senior German Air Force and Army rank until the promotion of Hermann Göring, the Commander of the Luftwaffe, to the even higher rank of &quot;reichsmarschall&quot; (Imperial Marshal or Marshal of the Realm) in July 1940. The German ranks of &quot;reichsmarschall&quot; and &quot;generalfeldmarschall&quot; ceased to exist with the fall of the Third Reich.

==Insignia and distinguishing flags==
===Rank insignia===
There are a variety of rank insignia in use by the different air forces which maintain a rank of marshal of the air force. Some, such as the Royal Air Force, derive the pattern from the sleeve lace for an admiral of the fleet, using one broad light blue band on a wider broad black band with four narrow light blue bands each on slightly wider black bands. Others use a pattern of stars, typically numbering five in total.

===Command flags===
The following command or rank flags are or have been in use:

==Current holders of the rank==

, there are 14 living individuals who hold or have held the rank, or its equivalents, of Marshal of the Air Force. 10 of those are royalty who have been appointed to the rank in a ceremonial capacity, including Queen Sirikit of Thailand, the Prince of Wales and the current head of state of Malaysia. In the case of Malaysia, the elected &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; is appointed a Marshal of the Air Force for his tenure as head of state, but relinquishes the rank after completing his term in office. He can, however, be re-appointed to the rank if he later serves another term.

The Duke of Edinburgh held the ceremonial rank of a Marshal of the Royal Air Force, as well as the honorary ranks of Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force and Marshal of the Royal New Zealand Air Force; owing to their smaller size, however, neither of the latter two air forces have ever used the rank in an operational capacity. Although the rank of Marshal of the Royal Canadian Air Force existed on paper until 1968, the Duke of Edinburgh was never appointed to this rank nor to the other Canadian 5-star ranks before they were abolished that year. In 2012, his son, the Prince of Wales, was appointed to the British rank.

The remaining four holders of the rank were all serving air officers, three of whom served as Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Air Force, and were promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Royal Air Force upon concluding their tenure. Of those, only Lord Craig did not retire then, as he went on to serve as Chief of the Defence Staff as a Marshal of the RAF. In June 2014, retired Air Chief Marshal the Lord Stirrup was promoted to Marshal of the RAF in a ceremonial capacity, marking the first time since 1992 that an RAF air officer had been awarded the rank; Lord Stirrup had served as Chief of the Defence Staff from 2006 to 2010.

Marshal of the Air Force Roshan Goonetileke of the Sri Lanka Air Force is the most recent man to gain the rank, having been promoted in October 2019. Goonetileke was credited in playing a major role in ending the almost three decade long civil war in his country. He was recently appointed as the Governor of the Western Province of Sri Lanka.

==List of marshals of the air force==

==Other countries==
The rank also exists or has existed (on paper) in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brunei, Iran, South Korea, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Vietnam, but not all of these countries have used it. The Turkish Air Force maintains a rank of &quot;hava mareşalı&quot; (literally air marshal but equivalent to five-star rank). The Indonesian Air Force maintains the rank of &quot;marsekal besar&quot; (literally, &quot;great marshal&quot; and also a five-star rank) although no Indonesian Air Force officer has ever been promoted to the rank. The French Air Force, in common with the French Army has marshal of France as its most senior rank. However, unlike the French Army, the Air Force has never had one of its officers created a marshal of France.

The United States does not use the rank, instead using general of the air force which has only been held once and is currently retained only on paper. China also does not use a marshal rank, preferring first class general (&quot;kong jun yi ji shang jiang&quot;) which has never been held by an air force officer and was abolished in 1994. Spain uses the equivalent rank of captain general of the Air Force which is held only by HM King Felipe VI.

==Fictional use==
A marshal of the air force is mentioned in Roald Dahl&#x27;s book &quot;The BFG&quot;. Dahl himself was a Royal Air Force officer during World War II.

<doc id="920598" wikidata="Q7265572" url="?curid=920598" title="QSound Labs">
<text>QSound Labs is an audio technology company based in Calgary, Canada. It is primarily a developer and provider of audio enhancement technologies for entertainment and communications devices and software. The company is best known as a pioneer of 3D audio effects, beginning with speaker-targeted positional 3D technology applied to arcade video games and professional music and film soundtrack production. QSound was founded by Larry Ryckman (CEO), Danny Lowe, and John Lees. Jimmy Iovine served as SVP of Music and Shelly Yakus as VP of Audio Engineering in its formative years.

==History==
The flagship technology first known simply as &quot;QSound&quot; saw its initial commercial application in the early 1990s, notably in Capcom arcade games and on many music releases by prominent artists. The first two QSound album titles were Sting&#x27;s &quot;The Soul Cages&quot; and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;.

From the original speaker-targeted QSound 3D process used in producer-side applications, QSound Labs developed a suite of positional and enhancement spatial audio technologies, including positional audio for stereo speakers, multi-channel speaker systems and stereo earphones; stereo expansion, and virtual surround, under several technology names. There is no longer any single process now referred to as &quot;QSound.&quot;

Although the hardware QSystem professional mixing processors and plug-in producer-side software tools were significant product offerings in the 1990s, most QSound technology is now incorporated in end-user products (such as video game software, computer sound cards and home entertainment electronics) by means of analog integrated circuits, digital signal processor (DSP) software libraries, host processor software and the like. QSound&#x27;s iQ software internet audio enhancement software, their first downloadable, stand-alone consumer product, ultimately spawned a successful product line including the iQFX series of plug-ins for RealNetwork&#x27;s RealPlayer.

In addition to spatial audio processing, the company has broadened its product line to include a long list of audio effects and controls such as static equalization, adaptive spectral enhancement, dynamic range controls, reverberation, and many other standard audio effects.

In 2003, QSound added a software MIDI wavetable ringtone synthesizer to its line-up. The effects suite and synthesizer are licensed in the form of software libraries to mobile phone manufacturers and providers of related technology (e.g. DSP&#x27;s and DSP operating systems), in order to provide polyphonic ringtone rendering and enhanced music or mobile TV playback on hand-held devices.

In 2009, the company was delisted from the NASDAQ exchange. Around 2012, the copyright date on QSound Labs&#x27; website was updated. Out of the 40 patents filed by QSound Labs, all have been abandoned or have expired (the last patent to expire was in 2013). The current status of the company is unknown, as such it is assumed to be inactive or defunct.

<text>Metius is a lunar impact crater located in the rugged highlands to the southeast of the Moon&#x27;s near side. To the southwest the rim is attached to the crater Fabricius. Offset to the west-northwest is the heavily worn crater Brenner. Further away to the northeast is the crater Rheita and the long gorge Vallis Rheita.

The rim of Metius does not protrude prominently into the surroundings and has an insignificant . A few small craters mar the outer wall, but generally it has a smoothed down appearance that is almost free of s. The floor is relatively flat with low central peaks. The most prominent crater on the floor is Metius B, located near the northeast rim.

Metius is a crater of Nectarian age.

The eponym for this crater is the Dutch geometer and astronomer Adriaan Adriaanszoon, who went by the name of Metius.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Metius.

<text>John Heffron (born July 19, 1970) is an American stand-up comic.

==Career==
John started his comedy career as a student at Eastern Michigan University, skipping night classes to perform stand-up comedy. He got his first gig as an emcee at the Main Street Comedy Showcase on the University of Michigan campus. After graduating, John immediately began working in his field of choice, touring the college circuit performing at more than 80 shows each year. By that time, he was already a seasoned comic with more than four years of experience. The college audience related to his type of humor, which talked about his days in college, the retro music that he and his classmates listened to and the Pop Rocks candy he played with as a kid. This material made him a hit on college campuses, where he recorded his first comedy CD &quot;Kid With A Cape&quot;.

By the age of 25, John was a successful headlining comedian who decided to also put his degrees in communications and psychology to work by taking a job as radio sidekick to Danny Bonaduce (later replaced by Steve Cochran) on the highly-rated Q95-5 Detroit radio morning show. He worked in Detroit for five years before making his way back to Los Angeles, making his home in Hollywood.

John has made numerous television appearances including NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;, two &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot; specials, and two seasons of &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;. He won the title of &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; in season 2. In addition, John has performed at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festivals in Montreal and Bermuda, as well as the HBO Comedy Festival in Aspen.

Also an entrepreneur, John—along with partner Joel Zimmer—Heffron released a board game, &quot;That Guy Game&quot;, which puts girls on a scavenger hunt for guys. According to InStyle, Entertainment Weekly and Glamour magazines, it became an immediate hit when Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore and SNL&#x27;s Rachel Dratch were spotted buying the game. Entrepreneur magazine featured John and Joel in its 2001 &quot;Hot 100&quot; issue. John took the idea a step further by developing a television pilot based on the concept, which received a significant amount of industry attention.

He also was a regular on a number of VH1 television series including &quot;My Coolest Years: My First Time&quot; and &quot;I Love The 80s&quot;. He toured with Charlie Murphy and Joe Rogan on the &quot;Real Men of Comedy&quot; tour in the fall of 2006 sponsored by Maxim and Bud Light. His DVD &quot;Middle Class Funny&quot; was released in 2009.

John continues to tour the US performing stand-up.

==Personal life==
John Heffron was born on July 19, 1970, in New York City and was raised in South Lyon, Michigan. He graduated in 1988 from South Lyon High School and in 1993 from Eastern Michigan University. In 2004, he married Sherry Rie Glenny; they divorced in 2017. John remarried in November of 2021 to yoga enthusiant Michelle Nogoy.

<text>The River Roch is a river in Greater Manchester in North West England, a tributary of the River Irwell.

==Course==
Rising on Chelburn Moor (south of Todmorden in the Pennines), the river flows south through Littleborough towards Rochdale where it is joined by the River Beal at Belfield, and the River Spodden from Whitworth. Turning west it runs past Heywood and Bury before meeting the River Irwell just to the east of Radcliffe.

== Etymology ==
The town of Rochdale is recorded as &quot;Recedham&quot; in the Domesday Book and &quot;Rachetham&quot; in 1193, with variations of &quot;Rechedham&quot; continuing into the thirteenth century. It is thought that these names represent a pre-existing Brittonic name for the river Roch, borrowed into Old English for the name of the settlement.

The early forms of &quot;Rachet-ham&quot; and &quot;Reched-ham&quot; suggest a compound of two elements, &quot;ro-ced&quot; or &quot;ro-cet&quot;. The first element is either from the common intensive prefix &quot;rö-&quot; (Modern Welsh &quot;rhy-&quot;, Cornish re-) meaning &quot;great&quot; and found in other river names such as the Ribble and the Rother or &quot;rag-&quot;, (Modern Welsh &quot;ar-&quot;) meaning &quot;opposite&quot; or &quot;adjacent to&quot;. The second element would then almost certainly be &quot;cę:d&quot; or &quot;cet&quot;, (Modern Welsh &quot;coed&quot;) meaning &quot;wood&quot;. This would give the name a meaning of &quot;River of the great wood&quot; or &quot;River opposite the wood&quot;.

Another etymology focused on the early forms similarities to &quot;Rheged&quot;, the Cumbric-speaking kingdom in North West England during the Middle Ages. Although this etymology is used to support the theory that the Roch may have been the centre of a separate kingdom known in Medieval Welsh literature as &quot;South Rheged&quot; or &quot;Argoed&quot; (opposite the wood), it remains unproven as the kingdom of Rheged&#x27;s boundaries have not been identified. A further suggestion is that the name &quot;rheged&quot; simply means &quot;area&quot; in the Cumbric language (related to &quot;Regio&quot; in Latin and &quot;Region&quot; in Modern English) and that the kingdom of Rheged and the river merely shared a common Celtic name.

Although Rochdale is pronounced (with a shorter &quot;o&quot; sound), the name of the river is still pronounced (with a long vowel sound).

==Later history==

The river has been culverted in Rochdale town centre since the early 20th century. This was built by the joining together of seven bridges to form one large bridge, making it one of the widest bridges in the world. Maintenance work was carried out on the bridge in the 1990s and the river was uncovered temporarily. In 2015 work began on opening the bridge again in a multimillion-pound project. On Boxing Day 2015, following heavy rain, the Roch burst its banks causing flooding in the town centre.

==Tributaries==
Moving upstream from the Irwell confluence, the tributaries include the following:

*Parr Brook
*Hollins Brook
*Whittle Brook
*Gigg Brook
*Barn Brook
**Green Brook
**Gipsy Brook 
*Tack Lee Brook

<text>Cars is a 2006 American animated sports comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The film was directed by John Lasseter, co-directed by Joe Ranft, produced by Darla K. Anderson, and written by Lasseter, Ranft, Dan Fogelman, Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin, and Jorgen Klubien based on a story by Lasseter, Ranft, and Klubien. The film stars an ensemble voice cast of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman (in his final voice acting theatrical film role), Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin, Michael Wallis, George Carlin, Paul Dooley, Jenifer Lewis, Guido Quaroni, Michael Keaton, Katherine Helmond, John Ratzenberger and Richard Petty, while race car drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr. (as &quot;Junior&quot;), Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and car enthusiast Jay Leno (as &quot;Jay Limo&quot;) voice themselves.

Set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic vehicles, the film follows a young self-obsessed racecar named Lightning McQueen who, on the way to the most important race of his life, becomes stranded in a forgotten town along U.S. Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he learns about friendship and begins to reevaluate his priorities.

Development for &quot;Cars&quot; started in 1998, after finishing the production of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, with a new script titled &quot;The Yellow Car&quot;, which was about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world with Klubien writing. It was announced that the producers agreed that it could be the next Pixar film after &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, scheduled for a 1999 release, particularly around June 4; the idea was later scrapped in favor of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Shortly after, production was resumed with major script changes. The film was inspired by Lasseter&#x27;s experiences on a cross-country road trip. Randy Newman composed the film&#x27;s score, while artists such as Sheryl Crow, Rascal Flatts, John Mayer and Brad Paisley contributed to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. &quot;Cars&quot; ultimately served as the final film independently produced by Pixar after its purchase by Disney in January 2006.

&quot;Cars&quot; premiered on May 26, 2006, at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, to generally positive reviews and commercial success, grossing $462 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2006. It received two nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature, but lost to &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (but won both the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film). The film was released on DVD on November 7, 2006, on VHS in limited quantities on February 19, 2007, and on Blu-ray on November 6, 2007. It was accompanied by the short &quot;One Man Band&quot; for its theatrical and home media releases. The film was dedicated to Ranft, who died in a car crash during the film&#x27;s production.

The success of &quot;Cars&quot; launched a multimedia franchise, which includes two sequels: &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011) and &quot;Cars 3&quot; (2017), as well as two spin-off films produced by Disneytoon Studios: &quot;Planes&quot; (2013) and &quot;&quot; (2014).

==Plot==
In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the Dinoco 400 race is the last of the Piston Cup season. The event intensifies a rivalry between the retiring seven-time champion, Strip &quot;The King&quot; Weathers, the cunning Chick Hicks, and the talented but overconfident rookie, Lightning McQueen, who are all tied for the most points. Desperate to win and leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-eze for the prestigious Dinoco, Lightning struggles with teamwork due to his self-centered attitude. During the race, Lightning refuses to take new tires, causing his rear tires to blow out before he can win. The race ends in a three-way tie between the leaders, setting the stage for a decisive race at the Los Angeles International Speedway in one week.

After the race, Lightning rushes through the night on the interstate to reach California inside his transport truck Mack. A mishap leaves Lightning stranded alone in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs, Arizona. Here, he inadvertently damages the main road, leading to him being sentenced to a community service assignment of repaving the road under the supervision of the town&#x27;s judge, Doc Hudson, who is prejudiced against Lightning for being a race car.

Lightning repaves the road shoddily in a rush to leave, and Doc challenges him to a race for his freedom, on the condition that he starts over from scratch if he loses. The overconfident Lightning, having never raced on a dirt road before, spins out on a turn and crashes into a cactus patch, with Doc having set up the race to dampen his ego. Over time, Lightning warms up to and befriends the town&#x27;s residents, especially Mater, a rusty tow truck, and Sally, who dreams of reviving Radiator Springs. As he bonds with the locals, Lightning helps rejuvenate Radiator Springs and develops a newfound appreciation for its charm. He discovers the town was once a bustling attraction for drivers on Route 66, before the construction of the interstate caused them to lose all their business traffic. Lightning also discovers that the bitter Doc, reticent about his past, used to race as the legendary Hudson Hornet until a disastrous crash ended his career. Lightning is dumbfounded that Doc considers his previous Piston Cups worthless junk.

Lightning finishes repairing the road and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs helping the local businesses, but Doc alerts the media to Lightning&#x27;s location, leading them and Mack to descend on the town and force Lightning to leave in time for the race. Doc regrets his actions after seeing the residents disappointed by his departure. At the race, Lightning initially struggles, but is buoyed by the arrival of his friends from Radiator Springs, who come to his aid in the pit. With Doc now acting as his crew chief, Lightning stages a remarkable comeback. However, Chick employs a PIT maneuver that intentionally damages the King, rendering him unable to continue. Reminded of Doc&#x27;s crash, Lightning halts just before the finish line, allowing Chick to win, and pushes the King across, allowing him to finish his last race.

The crowd and media condemn Chick&#x27;s victory and praise Lightning&#x27;s integrity and sportsmanship. Lightning is offered the Dinoco sponsorship, but declines out of newfound loyalty to Rust-eze. Returning to Radiator Springs, he reunites with Sally and declares his intention to establish his racing headquarters there, revitalizing the town.

It was also Paul Newman&#x27;s last non-documentary film role before his retirement in 2007 and death in 2008.

==Production==
===Development===

The development of &quot;Cars&quot; began in 1998, when Pixar finished production of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. At that time, Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called &quot;The Yellow Car&quot;, which was about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world inspired by &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, an idea triggered by the poor reception his fellow countrymen gave the Mini-El car. Some of the original drawings and characters were developed in 1998 and the producers agreed that &quot;Cars&quot; could be the next Pixar film after &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the idea was scrapped in favor of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Later, production resumed with major script changes, like giving Mater, Doc and a few other characters bigger parts.

John Lasseter said that inspiration for the film&#x27;s story came after he took a cross-country road trip with his wife and five sons in 2000. When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted Michael Wallis, a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film. In 2001, the film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Route 66&quot; (after U.S. Route 66), but the title was changed to &quot;Cars&quot; in order to avoid confusion with the 1960s television series of the same name. In addition, Lightning McQueen&#x27;s racing number was originally going to be 57 (a reference to 1957, Lasseter&#x27;s birth year), but was changed to 95 (a reference to 1995, the year Pixar&#x27;s first feature film &quot;Toy Story&quot; was released).

In 2006, Lasseter spoke about the inspiration for the film, saying: &quot;I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there&#x27;s motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called &#x27;Divided Highways,&#x27; which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That&#x27;s when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn&#x27;t quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis.&quot;

Years later in 2013, Klubien said the film was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made.

===Animation===

For the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company. Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.

In 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: &quot;It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they&#x27;re much tighter in their suspension. Others are older &#x27;50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way.&quot;

Unlike most anthropomorphic cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, the characters from Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;One Cab&#x27;s Family&quot; short and Disney&#x27;s own &quot;Susie the Little Blue Coupe&quot;), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, &quot;From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character.&quot; This decision was facetiously criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik.

In 2006, the supervising animator of the film, Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: &quot;Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that&#x27;s what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don&#x27;t have.&quot; Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: &quot;It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the &quot;Cars&quot; models, than it did to interpret something like &quot;The Incredibles&quot; models. With &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with &quot;Cars&quot;, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they&#x27;re cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It&#x27;s pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right.&quot;

Lasseter also explained that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: &quot;Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins.&quot; Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: &quot;John didn&#x27;t want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, they need to have that feel. They shouldn&#x27;t appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys.&quot; According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, &quot;Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can&#x27;t stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do.&quot;

Character shading supervisor on the film Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges on the film, saying: &quot;Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning as much as we could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality that might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone.&quot; Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: &quot;Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we&#x27;ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we&#x27;ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for &quot;Cars&quot; we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar.&quot;

Rendering lead Jessica McMackin spoke about the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: &quot;In addition to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and you want to get a feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall.&quot; Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: &quot;The ground-locking system is one of the things I&#x27;m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On &quot;Cars&quot;, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it.&quot;

Technical director Lisa Forsell explained that to enhance the richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: &quot;Digital matte paintings are a way to get a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It&#x27;s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you&#x27;ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away.&quot;

Computers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and 1,000 times faster than those used in &quot;Toy Story&quot;. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles.

==Soundtrack==

The &quot;Cars&quot; soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on June 6, 2006. Nine tracks on the soundtrack are by popular artists, while the remaining eleven are score cues by Randy Newman. It has two versions of the classic Bobby Troup jazz standard &quot;Route 66&quot; (popularized by Nat King Cole), one by Chuck Berry and a new version recorded specifically for the film&#x27;s credits performed by John Mayer. Brad Paisley contributed two of the nine tracks to the album, one being &quot;Find Yourself&quot; used for the end credits.

==Release==
&quot;Cars&quot; was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was moved to June 9, 2006. Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with Michael Eisner&#x27;s situation at Disney. When Pixar&#x27;s chief executive Steve Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.

===Home media===
&quot;Cars&quot; was released on DVD, in both its original theatrical 2.39:1 anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio and an open matte 1:33.1 fullscreen edition, on November 7, 2006, in the United States and Canada. This DVD was also released on October 25, 2006, in Australia and New Zealand and on November 27, 2006, in the United Kingdom. The release includes the DVD-exclusive short film &quot;Mater and the Ghostlight&quot; and the film&#x27;s theatrical short &quot;One Man Band&quot; as well as a 16-minute-long documentary about the film entitled &quot;Inspiration for Cars&quot;, which features director John Lasseter. This THX certified release also features an Easter egg in the main menu, which is a 45-second clip showing a &quot;Cars&quot; version of &quot;Boundin&#x27;&quot;. A VHS was released on February 19, 2007, to members of Disney&#x27;s home video club.

According to the Walt Disney Company, fivemillion copies of the DVD were sold the first two days it was available. The first week, it sold 6,250,856 units and 15,370,791 in total ($246,198,859). Unlike previous Pixar DVD releases, there is no two-disc special edition, and no plans to release one in the future. According to Sara Maher, DVD Production Manager at Pixar, John Lasseter and Pixar were preoccupied with productions like &quot;Ratatouille&quot;.

In the US and Canada, there were bonus discs available with the purchase of the film at Wal-Mart and at Target. The former featured a &quot;Geared-Up Bonus DVD Disc&quot; that focused on the music of the film, including the music video to &quot;Life Is A Highway&quot;, &quot;The Making of &quot;Life Is A Highway&quot;&quot;, &quot;Cars: The Making of the Music&quot;, and &quot;Under The Hood&quot;, a special that originally aired on the ABC Family cable channel. The latter&#x27;s bonus was a &quot;Rev&#x27;d Up DVD Disc&quot; that featured material mostly already released as part of the official &quot;Cars&quot; podcast and focused on the inspiration and production of the movie.

&quot;Cars&quot; was also released on Blu-ray Disc on November 6, 2007, one year after the DVD release. It was the first Pixar film to be released on Blu-ray (alongside &quot;Ratatouille&quot; and &quot;Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1&quot;), and was re-released as a Blu-ray Disc and DVD combo pack and DVD only edition in April 2011. The film was released for the first time in 3D on October 29, 2013, as part of &quot;Cars: Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, which included the releases on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD. In 2019, &quot;Cars&quot; was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend, &quot;Cars&quot; earned $60 million in 3,985 theaters in the United States, ranking number one at the box office. For three years, it would hold the record for having the highest opening weekend for any car-oriented film until it was surpassed by &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; in 2009. In the United States, the film held onto the number one spot for two weeks before being surpassed by &quot;Click&quot; and then by &quot;Superman Returns&quot; the following weekend. The film then earned $33.7 million during its second weekend while competing against &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; and &quot;Nacho Libre&quot;. By July 2006, it had approached the $200 million mark, becoming the third film of the year to do so, following &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; and &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. It went on to gross $462 million worldwide and $244 million in the United States. &quot;Cars&quot; was the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2006, behind &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot;.

In the UK, &quot;Cars&quot; managed to beat out &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; to claim the number one spot, earning $3.4 million in its opening weekend. It would be overtaken by &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in its second weekend, but earned $2.3 million. Then, the film reclaimed the top spot with $1.3 million during its third weekend.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews and an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Cars&quot; offers visual treats that more than compensate for its somewhat thinly written story, adding up to a satisfying diversion for younger viewers.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 39 critics reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

William Arnold of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; praised it as &quot;one of Pixar&#x27;s most imaginative and thoroughly appealing movies ever,&quot; and Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;a work of American art as classic as it is modern.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, saying that it &quot;tells a bright and cheery story, and then has a little something profound lurking around the edges. In this case, it&#x27;s a sense of loss.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, &quot;Fueled with plenty of humor, action, heartfelt drama, and amazing new technical feats, &quot;Cars&quot; is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;Existing both in turbo-charged today and the gentler &#x27;50s, straddling the realms of Pixar styling and old Disney heart, this new-model &quot;Cars&quot; is an instant classic.&quot; Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a negative review, saying, &quot;Despite representing another impressive technical achievement, it&#x27;s the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutique&#x27;s movies, and—in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing—drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection.&quot; Robert Wilonsky of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;What ultimately redeems &quot;Cars&quot; from turning out a total lemon is its soul. Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame.&quot; Ella Taylor of &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;&quot;Cars&quot; cheerfully hitches cutting-edge animation to a folksy narrative plugging friendship, community and a Luddite mistrust of high tech.&quot;

Gene Seymour of &quot;Newsday&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, saying, &quot;And as pop flies go, &quot;Cars&quot; is pretty to watch, even as it loops, drifts and, at times, looks as if it&#x27;s just hanging in midair.&quot; Colin Covert of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;It takes everything that&#x27;s made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence—strong characters, tight pacing, spot-on voice casting, a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure, pixilated bliss—and carries them to the next stage.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, saying, &quot;What&#x27;s surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart.&quot; Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar, probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop—and the film&#x27;s great fun, if well under the level of the first &quot;Toy Story&quot;.&quot; Jessica Reaves of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, &quot;While it&#x27;s a technically perfect movie, its tone is too manic, its characters too jaded and, in the end, its story too empty to stand up to expectations.&quot; James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, saying, &quot;While &quot;Cars&quot; may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006&#x27;s other animated films, it&#x27;s several laps behind its Pixar siblings.&quot; Lisa Kennedy of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, saying, &quot;&quot;Cars&quot; idles at times. And it&#x27;s not until its final laps that the movie gains the emotional traction we&#x27;ve come to expect from the &quot;Toy Story&quot; and Nemo crews.&quot; Amy Biancolli of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, saying, &quot;It thunders ahead with breezy abandon, scoring big grins on its way.&quot;

Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;The animation is stunningly rendered. But the story is always the critical element in Pixar movies, and &quot;Cars&quot;&#x27; story is heartfelt with a clear and unabashed moral.&quot; David Edelstein of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;Like the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films, &quot;Cars&quot; is a state-of-the-computer-art plea on behalf of outmoded, wholesome fifties technology, with a dash of Zen by way of George Lucas.&quot; Moira MacDonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, &quot;Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie&#x27;s young audience—&quot;Cars&quot; finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film two out of five stars, saying, &quot;&quot;Cars&quot; might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn&#x27;t get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie&#x27;s deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it.&quot; Derek Adams of &quot;Time Out&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film&#x27;s struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it&#x27;s a Pixar film, right? And they&#x27;re always worth a gander no matter what anyone says.&quot;

===Accolades===

&quot;Cars&quot; had a highly successful run during the 2006 awards season. Many film critic associations such as the Broadcast Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review named it the best Animated Feature Film of 2006. &quot;Cars&quot; also received the title of Best Reviewed Animated Feature of 2006 from Rotten Tomatoes. Randy Newman and James Taylor received a Grammy Award for the song &quot;Our Town&quot;, which later went on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song (an award it lost to &quot;I Need to Wake Up&quot; from &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;). The film also earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature alongside &quot;Monster House&quot;, but both films lost to &quot;Happy Feet&quot;. &quot;Cars&quot; was also selected as the Favorite Family Movie at the 33rd People&#x27;s Choice Awards. The most prestigious award that &quot;Cars&quot; received was the inaugural Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. &quot;Cars&quot; also won the highest award for animation in 2006, the Best Animated Feature Annie Award. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list.

==Video game==
A video game of the same name was released on June 6, 2006, for Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Xbox. It was also released on October 23, 2006, for Xbox 360 and November 16, 2006, for Wii. Much like the film, the video game got mainly positive reviews. GameSpot gave 7.0 out of 10 for Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation 2 versions, 7.6 out of 10 for the GameCube and Xbox versions, and 7.4 out of 10 for the PSP version. Metacritic gave 65 out of 100 for the Wii version, 54 out of 100 for the DS version, 73 out of 100 for the PC version, 71 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version, and 70 out of 100 for the PSP version.

==Similar films==
Marco Aurélio Canônico of &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot; described &quot;The Little Cars&quot; series (&quot;Os Carrinhos&quot; in Portuguese), a Brazilian computer graphics film series by Vídeo Brinquedo, as a derivative of &quot;Cars&quot;. Canônico discussed whether lawsuits from Pixar would appear. The Brazilian Ministry of Culture posted Marcus Aurelius Canônico&#x27;s article on its website.

It has also been noted that the plot of &quot;Cars&quot; mirrors that of &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot;, a 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor who eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values and falls in love with a local law student as result of being sentenced to work at the town hospital after causing a traffic collision in a small town. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of &quot;Cars&quot; plagiarized the script of &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot;.

<doc id="920617" wikidata="Q2525283" url="?curid=920617" title="Wiseguy (TV series)">
<text>Wiseguy is an American crime drama television series that aired on CBS from September 16, 1987, to December 8, 1990, for a total of 75 episodes over four seasons. The series was produced by Stephen J. Cannell and was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to avoid the higher studio costs associated with filming in Los Angeles.

&quot;Wiseguy&quot; originally starred Ken Wahl as Vinnie Terranova, a Brooklyn native and Fordham University graduate who was a deep cover operative for the FBI under the supervision of senior agent Frank McPike, played by Jonathan Banks. The primary cast was rounded out by Jim Byrnes, who played an information operative known as Lifeguard (real name Daniel Burroughs) who assisted Vinnie in the field.

After the third season, Wahl departed from the series. Steven Bauer was brought in to replace Wahl as the lead, with Cecil Hoffman joining as a fourth regular cast member alongside Bauer and the returning Banks and Byrnes. &quot;Wiseguy&quot; ended its run midway through 1991 with three produced episodes left unaired.

==Synopsis==
The series followed Vincent &quot;Vinnie&quot; Terranova, an undercover agent of the OCB (Organized Crime Bureau), a fictional division of the FBI. The show kept its focus on both the mechanics of being deep undercover and the consequences of the protagonist&#x27;s actions.

Unlike similar series of the day, &quot;Wiseguy&quot; was serialized over multiple episodes telling a self-contained story that would conclude in the final episode of the cycle. This gave rise to the industry term &quot;story arc&quot;. Some cycles were short while others were extended, but each new story had a specific set of central characters exclusive to it who would appear over the course of multiple episodes.

===Season 1===

==== Sonny Steelgrave storyline ====
FBI undercover agent Vinnie Terranova is released from prison after serving an 18-month sentence to establish his cover. After his training agent is murdered by Dave Steelgrave (Gianni Russo), an Atlantic City Mafia boss, Vinnie vows to infiltrate the organization and take the Steelgraves down. He earns the trust of Sonny Steelgrave (Ray Sharkey), Dave&#x27;s brother, and after Dave&#x27;s death and the apparent defection of one of the Steelgrave captains, he is made Sonny&#x27;s second-in-command. Over time, Vinnie feels conflicted by his genuine feelings of friendship towards Sonny, and having to lie to his mother about his work for the government in order to maintain his cover. After an attack lands her in the hospital, Vinnie tells his mother the true nature of his work rather than risk her going to her grave thinking him a criminal. Vinnie&#x27;s contacts Frank McPike and Lifeguard learn of this breach in protocol through surveillance but conceal it from their superiors using an edited audio recording.

With Vinnie&#x27;s info, the OCB sets up concealed video cameras at the venue for Sonny&#x27;s bachelor party. Sonny murders &quot;Pat the Cat&quot; Patrice, his chief Mafia rival, at the party. When he finds police have surrounded the building, Sonny realizes that Vinnie, who knew about a hit Patrice put on him and said nothing, must be an undercover agent. About to be arrested for his crimes, Sonny commits suicide rather than face prison. The story arc ends with it in doubt whether Vinnie will be able to overcome the guilt he feels over his betrayal of Sonny and continue to work as an undercover agent.

==== Mel Profitt storyline ====
Vinnie, using his reputation as part of the Steelgrave crime family, makes contact with a hitman/assassin named Roger Lococco (William Russ). However, Vinnie soon discovers a much bigger target: Roger&#x27;s boss, the manic depressive billionaire arms dealer Mel Profitt (Kevin Spacey) and his sister Susan (Joan Severance), with whom he has an incestuous relationship. Mel is addicted to prescription medication (always administered to him by Susan) which further contributes to his unstable emotional state. He is also a believer in Malthusian economics. Matters are complicated by Vinnie falling in love with Susan and beginning a sexual relationship with her.

Lococco (who turns out to be a CIA agent) encourages Mel to finance insurrectionist Louis Cabra of the Caribbean nation Il Pavao, but Mel becomes convinced that Cabra put a death curse on him. Cabra&#x27;s rival insurrectionist Emanja Mora offers Mel help, but takes advantage of his trust to steal the crystal which Mel believes houses his soul and gives it to Lococco, who smashes it in front of Mel. As a result, Mel suffers a complete mental breakdown. In a mercy killing, Susan injects Mel with a lethal overdose of amphetamines and gives him a Viking funeral. Susan goes insane (with help from Lococco, who gaslights her in order to obtain signed withdrawal slips for Mel&#x27;s accounts) and is committed to a mental facility.

The Profitt connection is part of a plot by the CIA to train mercenaries and install a puppet regime in Il Pavao. With info given him by Vinnie, Lococco learns his training officer and immediate superior Herb Ketcher is running the operation as a front for an American corporation. Lococco turns state&#x27;s evidence. Shortly after his testimony, Lococco goes off the grid. Ketcher, after being exposed, takes his own life before consequences can be dealt him. As the arc comes to an end, Vinnie announces his resignation from the OCB.

Stephen J. Cannell, producer of &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, stated that the character Jim Profit from the short-lived Fox series &quot;Profit&quot; (which Cannell also produced) was named after and partially based on the Mel Profitt character. Writer/artist John Byrne has acknowledged that his characters Desmond and Phoebe Marrs, main cast members of the 1990s comic book series &quot;Namor the Sub-Mariner&quot;, were heavily inspired by Mel and Susan Profitt.

=== Season 2 ===

==== White supremacy story line ====
At the beginning of the second season, Vinnie is living at home with his mother and brother, Father Pete (Gerald Anthony) and working for a friend at a gas station as everyone in his neighborhood still believes he is in the Mafia. McPike is dispatched to find Vinnie by the new director of OCB, Paul Beckstead (Ken Jenkins). McPike must either debrief Vinnie to accept his resignation, or bring him back from sabbatical. Vinnie refuses to go along.

Vinnie&#x27;s friend gets an eviction notice and nearly is driven to sabotage in an attempt to protect his business. A patron of his turns him on to the teachings of Dr. Knox Pooley (Fred Dalton Thompson), who leads a nativist group with white supremacist leanings called the &quot;Pilgrims of Promise&quot;. His right-hand man, Calvin Hollis (Paul Guilfoyle), is an extremist, and leads a group of Pilgrims in an attack on a synagogue. Pete goes on television condemning the attack; shortly after he is run down in an alley.

After agreeing to return to work, but only on his terms, Vinnie arranges a gun sale to Calvin, against the advice of Beckstead, who believes the Pilgrims of Promise are harmless kooks not worth pursuing. Vinnie calls off the sting when Calvin shows up at the exchange with Ritchie (Tim Guinee), a young neighborhood friend. Ritchie confesses to Vinnie that he helped Calvin get the money for the guns in an armed robbery in which an off-duty police officer was murdered. Vinnie takes Ritchie under his wing, guiding him as an undercover agent in hopes of reducing his inevitable sentence as accessory to murder.

Vinnie finds Pete&#x27;s personal effects in the grill of a car parked at a Pilgrims of Promise rally, but refrains from exacting vengeance, instead setting up his brother&#x27;s killer for arrest at an arms deal. Hollis murders a talk show host who ridiculed the Pilgrims of Promise on the air. This leads Pooley to disown him. Ritchie recovers the murder weapon, allowing a warrant to be issued for Calvin&#x27;s arrest, but Calvin perishes in a home invasion gone awry. Ritchie is sentenced to 18 months. Pooley escapes prosecution by claiming to be just a con man and getting Calvin to exonerate him from any involvement in the murders in a recorded phone call. He moves on to selling beachfront real estate in Florida.

==== Garment trade story line ====
David Sternberg (Ron Silver) and his father Eli (Jerry Lewis) run a clothing business, and are being squeezed by garment district kingpin Rick Pinzolo (Stanley Tucci). David goes to the OCB for help; thus Vinnie is recruited to act as security for the Sternbergs. In the episode &quot;Next of Kin,&quot; Vinnie is hit by a taxi cab and replaced by agent John Henry Raglin (Anthony Denison), a philandering family man who was on a leave of absence after he blew the covers of two OCB agents during an interrogation. (This was done in order to allow Ken Wahl to recover from a broken ankle he suffered in an on-set accident.) John finds that Pinzolo has no way of profiting from his antagonism of the Sternbergs, leading him to the realization that Pinzolo is in fact merely a pawn of David&#x27;s cousin Carole (Patricia Charbonneau), daughter of the company&#x27;s founder. She blames Eli for taking the company from her father and seduced Pinzolo in order to get him to do the dirty work.

A shipment of dresses modified by Pinzolo to lack sufficient flame retardant brings on a wave of class action lawsuits, toppling the Sternberg company. David goes over the edge, kidnapping Pinzolo and attacking bank security guards with a gun, prompting them to fatally shoot David. Suddenly fearing Pinzolo will have her killed in order to prevent her incriminating him, Carole goes to Pinzolo in hopes he will say something incriminating for her tape recorder, but he kills her instead. Having failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing and allowed everyone who might have testified against Pinzolo to be killed, John simply murders Pinzolo.

==== Dead Dog Records story line ====
Upon his recovery, Vinnie is informed that music label Dead Dog Records was seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, who traded it to the OCB. Vinnie proposes to infiltrate the music industry in search of corruption as the new executive of Dead Dog. Fast-talking, puppy-dog-eyed talent agent Bobby Travis (Glenn Frey) talks Vinnie into taking him on as a minority partner; Vinnie realizes Bobby is washed up in the industry but can show him the ropes and be the public face of Dead Dog so that his cover is maintained. Bobby tells him about cleans, music products sold overseas and left off the accounting books, thus bypassing taxes and royalties.

Hoping to raise Dead Dog&#x27;s profile so he can connect with people selling cleans, Vinnie signs fallen idol Diana Price (Debbie Harry) and funds a recording of her song &quot;Brite Side&quot; under brilliant but violent tempered producer Johnny Medley (Paul McCrane). English-American record mogul Winston Newquay (pronounced Noo-kway, rather than Nyoo-key in the English fashion) offers to buy Dead Dog Records, but Vinnie distrusts him and instead turns Dead Dog over to the husband-and-wife owners of Shakala Records, Isaac (Paul Winfield) and Amber Twine (Patti D&#x27;Arbanville). Isaac proves to be as crooked as Newquay; on an overseas business trip Bobby finds Isaac has released a bootleg EP consisting of &quot;Bright Side&quot; (Price&#x27;s only song with Dead Dog/Shakala) and some standards recorded by Price soundalikes. Newquay, played by Tim Curry, is Price&#x27;s former manager and lover, and Vinnie sends her to Jamaica for fear she will sign with Newquay again.

Vinnie tries to tempt away Newquay&#x27;s hottest act, singer Eddie Tempest (Billy Wirth), with the opportunity to work with Medley and hit songwriter Monroe Blue (Ron Taylor). The fight over Eddie becomes moot after Isaac, a compulsive gambler, loses Shakala Records to Newquay in a poker game. Eddie discovers Newquay has been siphoning off his accounts after one of his checks bounces; he tries to get revenge by seducing Newquay&#x27;s wife Claudia (Deidre Hall), not knowing the Newquays routinely have extramarital affairs in order to spice up their relationship. During sex they fall through a skylight to their deaths.

OCB&#x27;s efforts to build a case around Newquay&#x27;s selling of cleans prove fruitless, since Newquay is savvy enough to keep the profits from the cleans overseas. A sting operation in which Isaac offers Newquay an unreleased Eddie Tempest tape yields a recording of Newquay planning to sell cleans of the tape. The case is dismissed as entrapment, but the recording leads many artists to abandon Newquay after Bobby shows them loopholes which allow them to exit their contracts while retaining the rights to their recordings. Isaac dies when sex with Amber elevates his heart rate to the point of a heart attack. Grief over the sex-caused deaths of Claudia and Isaac (who was both Newquay&#x27;s business rival and his best friend) drives Newquay to a mental breakdown. Now believing himself to be Elvis Presley, he is institutionalized and the running of his company turned over to a trustee. Amber relaunches Shakala Records from the ground up. Dead Dog Records is turned over to Bobby.

====Le Lacrime d&#x27;Amore====
This arc, which lasts just two episodes, acts as a bridge between &quot;Aria for Don Aiuppo&quot;, the Dead Dog Records story, and the Mafia Wars story. Amber plans to sell Shakala Records with the counsel of attorney Roger Totland (Thomas Ian Griffith), who is also wining and dining her. Driven by jealousy, Vinnie runs a background check on Roger and deduces that he is negotiating for Shakala to be sold to a crooked real estate developer. Amber calls off the sale and begins a romantic relationship with Vinnie. His mother and stepfather, Don Rudy Aiuppo (George O. Petrie), return to the U.S. to meet Amber. Vinnie&#x27;s mother initially disapproves of Amber, but they win her over and Vinnie and Amber become engaged. Wanting to ensure their matrimonial bliss is not disturbed, Don Aiuppo introduces Vinnie to the local Mafia commission and warns them against bothering his family. The return of Don Aiuppo to the U.S. causes a stir, and Aiuppo is shot and wounded.

===Season 3===

==== Mafia Wars story line ====
Vinnie declares himself the temporary head of the local Mafia commission (to Frank McPike&#x27;s delight) in order to find out who ordered the hit on Don Aiuppo at the end of season 2. The Mafia upheaval sparks off a rivalry between Albert Cericco (Robert Davi) and Joey Grosset (John Snyder), whose father-in-law was killed in another recent hit. Amber cannot handle the strain of Vinnie being in this prolonged danger, and breaks up with him.

Don Aiuppo bugs a payphone outside his hospital room, thinking that the various Mafiosi visiting him will be using it just after taking their leave; in this way he overhears Grosset mentioning he ordered the two hits, and Vinnie contacting Uncle Mike. He tells Cericco about Grosset&#x27;s guilt; Cericco murders Grosset, and is arrested by OCB. From prison Cericco negotiates with Grosset&#x27;s widow Gina (Anne De Salvo) and Vinnie for them to sell a large shipment of cocaine he smuggled to the Mafia commission. This allows Frank to arrest the entire commission. Vinnie belatedly deduces that Aiuppo manipulated him into bringing down the commission and orchestrated Cericco&#x27;s murder of Grosset in order to exact revenge on both; he blames Cericco for the Mafia operation in which his son was inadvertently killed. An outraged Vinnie tells Aiuppo that he wants nothing more to do with him. Aiuppo is left heartbroken, having already been renounced by Vinnie&#x27;s mother, who blames him for Vinnie becoming associated with the Mafia again.

==== Washington, D.C., story line (&quot;The Capitol Conspiracy&quot;)====
Vinnie is summoned to the Justice Department and put in charge of an investigation of Japanese yen counterfeiting. He is aware that he is being set up by the unscrupulous General Leland Masters (Norman Lloyd), who seeks payback for the shutdown of the Il Pavao operation, but plays along in hopes of collecting evidence against Masters. Masters aims to undermine the Japanese economy by printing large amounts of counterfeit yen and smuggling them into Japan on cargo aircraft. The author of the theory behind the conspiracy, Dr. Andrew Valenti, is murdered in what is made to look like a convenience store robbery, but the conspirators&#x27; cover is blown due to the assassin having used bullets loaded with curare. Vinnie is covertly photographed questioning reclusive millionaire Prescott Wilson (Ford Rainey), under whose name the theory was contracted. Wilson denies any involvement. When the counterfeit yen is seized en route, Vinnie and Wilson become the focus of an investigation, with the photos as incriminating evidence. Wilson delivers a string of insults against Masters in front of the investigating committee, which prompts Major Vernon Biggs (Stan Shaw) to confess to orchestrating the murder of Valenti at the orders of Admiral Walter Strichen (Stephen Joyce). Strichen then also starts insulting Masters, who loses his temper and shoots Strichen. Masters is arrested for murdering Strichen.

==== Lynchboro/Seattle story line ====
Vinnie is made a deputy of a small town called Lynchboro in Washington state, where the mining magnate Mark Volchek (Steve Ryan) runs the town like a dictatorship, hosts criminal operations such as a brothel, and has a curious obsession with the movie &quot;Mr. Sardonicus&quot;. Vinnie works under Sheriff Matthew Stemkowsky, nicknamed &quot;Stem&quot; (David Strathairn).

Recent murders, including several deputies, are determined to be the work of a serial killer, and a federal task force is sent to Lynchboro. Volchek, fearful of the disruption and attention, is determined to identify the killer through his knowledge of the town&#x27;s residents. Volchek works with McPike to narrow down the suspects through a rapid series of deductions. Stem cracks under the intensifying pressure, confesses his crimes, and commits suicide with a stun gun. Vinnie has flashbacks of Sonny Steelgrave&#x27;s death and goes off the grid, calling in a favor from Roger Lococco. Lococco replaces Stem as sheriff and looks deeper into Volchek. He finds that despite his eccentricities, Volchek is a natural leader, beloved by the townspeople, and has a dream to build a hospital for Lynchboro focusing on cryogenics. Concluding that Lynchboro will be worse off if Volchek is removed, Lococco helps take down the official who Volchek planned to bribe for a hospital permit, but hides the bribe money so that there is no evidence against Volchek himself. However, Volchek becomes despondent at the failure to secure the permit. Lococco, Frank, and brothel worker Lacey (Darlanne Fluegel) re-enact part of &quot;Mr. Sardonicus&quot; with Volchek as Sardonicus, using the &quot;merciful&quot; ending in which he is cured, to help him recover.

Vinnie goes to Seattle, rents a room in a transient hotel, and takes a job with Health Elimination Services, which specializes in dumping medical waste. Vinnie discovers the job resulted in a hepatitis outbreak at a school, but his boss John Kousakis (Vincent Guastaferro) is unconcerned. Vinnie mails information on the illegal dumping to the health inspector, not knowing he is part of the same criminal organization as Kousakis. Vinnie kills two hired killers sent after him. Immediately consumed by remorse, he contemplates suicide but instead finds respite in a city church. After the pastor (Eddie Bracken) hears Vinnie&#x27;s story, he holds a press conference at the church to expose the dumping. McPike and Kousakis find Vinnie there simultaneously. Kousakis&#x27;s bullet misses Vinnie and wounds McPike. Frank is left comatose and doctors say there will probably be brain damage.

Kousakis hides out in the church belfry, but Vinnie stumbles upon him when he goes to repair the bells, acting on a religious intuition that they may wake Frank from his coma. Kousakis throws himself down the stairs and dies instantly. Frank is awakened by the church bells, but whether or not he is suffering from brain damage is left as an end-of-season cliffhanger.

=== Season 4 ===
After the third season ended, Ken Wahl left &quot;Wiseguy&quot; over a dispute with CBS over the direction of the show. Steven Bauer was brought in to be the new lead character, a former United States Attorney named Michael Santana who had recently been disbarred. Jonathan Banks and Jim Byrnes returned in their regular roles, and new addition Cecil Hoffman rounded out the cast. A new theme song by Mike Post, who wrote the original theme, was commissioned and had a more Latin flair. The series also found a new timeslot, moving to Saturday nights at 10:00 pm Eastern.

The fourth season was only done as part of a realignment of CBS&#x27; prime time programming lineup that saw switches of other programming, along with some cancellations.

====Guzman storyline====

The season begins with a raid on a drug warehouse in Miami run by the Medellín Cartel, with United States Attorney Michael Santana leading the raid. The head of the cartel is put on trial and is headed for a near certain conviction. However, as the jury deliberates, a Miami policeman comes forward and reveals he coerced a confession which led to the warrant being issued. Santana&#x27;s misconduct after finding all of this out results in the dismissal of the case and eventually his disbarment.

Meanwhile, back in Washington, a now-bearded McPike has fully healed from the gunshot wounds he sustained at the end of the previous year and Director Beckstead is looking to have him assume desk duty. McPike, after all he has been through over the recent months, does not agree and leaves frustrated.

Soon, however, that becomes the least of his problems. A phone call to Lifeguard reveals a surprising bit of information: Vinnie has suddenly, and abruptly, stopped checking in with him. Since this is highly irregular, considering how Vinnie and Lifeguard keep their check-in schedule, McPike decides to find out more info and sets out to find Vinnie himself. Since his last known location was Brooklyn, McPike heads to his apartment. Here, he finds that Vinnie’s shower is on and running in his bathroom, the television set in his living room is turned on, and a pot of pasta is cooking on the stove. Vinnie, however, is not there, and McPike discovers a handprint on the door. Getting back in touch with Lifeguard, the two men deduce that Vinnie could not have left his apartment willingly and was likely abducted.

Trying to find answers, and convinced that someone is hiding something from him, McPike drops in on Carlotta Terranova and Don Aiuppo to find out more. One of their neighbors, a Catholic priest, had been murdered by a right-wing death squad in El Salvador, and Vinnie had been assisting the family in trying to find answers. Since Vinnie had made contact with Michael Santana before disappearing, McPike travels to Miami to meet with him and confirms that Vinnie was indeed taken by force from his apartment.

Soon, McPike and Santana find Amado Guzman (Maximilian Schell), a Cuban-American businessman who works for the cartel as a money launderer. They also find out that Guzman is offering support to the Salvadoran death squad, which in addition to murdering the priest is responsible for Vinnie&#x27;s kidnapping. With the help of U.S. Attorney Hillary Stein (Hoffmann), who had been working the original case as Santana&#x27;s AUSA before his removal and disbarment and was his love interest, they take Guzman&#x27;s operation down.

Despite this, OCB is never able to locate Vinnie. He is presumed dead, being killed by the same death squad he had been investigating, and a memorial service is held in his honor. McPike speaks at the service, where he reveals the truth regarding Vinnie&#x27;s services with the FBI and OCB.

====OCB disbands====

With the Guzman investigation closed, McPike convinces Santana to become an official OCB agent. However, Director Beckstead is forced to shut down the task force due to budget cuts. Instead, McPike and Santana are sent to the New York FBI office to work in tandem with the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office there. They are immediately thrust into an investigation into a scheme involving the deaths of several naval pilots in crashes involving faulty plane parts. Former AUSA Stein, meanwhile, has joined her family&#x27;s law firm and taken on the case, but after the firm&#x27;s partners elect not to go after the partmaker she turns her attention to finding justice for the families affected by the crashes. Through the work of McPike and Santana, as well as the continued covert work from Lifeguard, the head of the company is arrested and brought to justice.

===Cancellation===
Following the first low-rated episode of the fourth season, CBS halted production on &quot;Wiseguy&quot; pending an increase in ratings. It is unclear whether production ever resumed after this point, since CBS offered no further updates on the status of the show, but following the broadcast of the episode &quot;Witness Protection for the Archangel Lucifer&quot; on December 8, 1990, &quot;Wiseguy&quot; was cancelled, leaving three produced episodes unbroadcast.

The program was never the strongest ratings draw, despite the positive feedback from critics. Discussing &quot;Wiseguy&quot; in retrospect, critic Matt Zoller Seitz said that the dense, long-form narrative which drew critical praise also kept the show from drawing a large viewership. The loss of Ken Wahl combined with the move to a traditionally low rated Saturday night spot depleted the ratings further.

Ken Wahl said that the entire fourth season concept was &quot;ridiculous&quot; because it got away from what &quot;Wiseguy&quot; had been about: Whereas before the show was more character driven, CBS wanted to make the show more of an action-based crime drama and Wahl felt he could not continue in the role if that was where they wanted to go.

=== Non-arc episodes ===

There were also several stand-alone episodes between the arcs, most of which dealt with the personal lives of the main characters. For instance:

====&quot;Aria for Don Aiuppo&quot;====
Mama Carlotta Terranova falls for and marries an old flame, Rudy Aiuppo, whom she had formerly given up when he chose a life of crime. Aiuppo switches places with his recently reconciled (and dead-ringer) brother, who is deported to Italy, while Aiuppo fades back into the old neighborhood.

====&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;====
Frank&#x27;s wife Jenny is dying of liver failure, and cannot get a transplant due to her alcoholism. Frank uses money given to Vinnie by Roger in &quot;Date with an Angel&quot; to obtain an under-the-table liver transplant, saving her life. However, feeling that Frank was the cause of her drinking, she demands a separation, and Frank temporarily moves in with Vinnie.

====&quot;White Noise&quot;====
Vinnie goes undercover in a corrupt mental hospital, but not by choice: disgraced former OCB chief Daryl Elias (John M. Jackson) edits Vinnie&#x27;s cover as a violently unstable patient into hospital records, and Vinnie is committed when he tries to check out after a physical exam. Through a series of hallucinations of Sonny Steelgrave, Vinnie resolves his guilt issues.

====&quot;Call it Casaba&quot;====
Vinnie, Frank, and Lifeguard go on a camping weekend, but Lifeguard has his daughter&#x27;s marriage on his mind. This is not helped when the daughter shows up at his cabin. This episode is a fan favorite, and was especially a favorite of co-star Jonathan Banks.

====&quot;Sleepwalk&quot;====
After the &quot;Mafia Wars&quot; arc, Vinnie tries to patch things up with Amber Twine. At the suggestion of a psychiatrist, they practice chastity while staying at Lifeguard&#x27;s cabin. However, even in this context Amber cannot give up the music business, and Vinnie realizes that he in turn cannot give up being an undercover agent, so they amicably break up again. This sequence features a cameo by blues harp player Kim Wilson and his band, The Fabulous Thunderbirds.

====&quot;How Will They Remember Me?&quot;====
Vinnie discovers his late father&#x27;s diary and sees his father (also played by Ken Wahl) faced the same temptations from criminals that Vinnie faces. This episode does not feature Frank McPike, due to the episode mostly taking place in flashbacks. The flashbacks are all in black-and-white.

====&quot;People Do It All the Time&quot;====
Lifeguard&#x27;s family troubles continue as he comes to grips with becoming a grandfather. He steps in when his son-in-law takes a job with an unscrupulous construction company.

====&quot;The Reunion&quot;====
Vinnie attends his high school reunion, where he is reunited with an old flame, Denise Denelli (Cathy Moriarty), who now works for the NYPD, and Mike &quot;Mooch&quot; Cacciatore (Tony Ganios), the defense attorney from the Garment Trade arc and Vinnie&#x27;s high school buddy. When Frank informs Vinnie that Denise has bugged his house because of his Mafia association, Vinnie is enraged at her betrayal of their friendship and hatches a revenge scheme. Denise and Mooch are nearly killed in the resulting misadventure, and end up marrying each other.

====&quot;Meet Mike McPike&quot;====
Frank has family problems when his father, Mike McPike, gets thrown out of yet another nursing home. Frank takes him in temporarily, but once Mike realizes Frank no longer lives with his family, he becomes determined to get Frank and Jenny back together.

====&quot;To Die in Bettendorf&quot;====
Sid Royce (Dennis Lipscomb), Patrice&#x27;s Harvard-educated accountant, and his wife Allison have been in a witness protection program since Sid turned state&#x27;s evidence following the murder of Patrice, with Sid working as a shoe salesman named &quot;Elvis Prim&quot; in Bettendorf, Iowa. Allison cannot stand this lifestyle any longer and leaves Sid with a man in a truck, causing Sid to have a mental breakdown. Sid tracks down Frank just as Frank and Jenny return from their first date since the separation, and uses Jenny as a hostage. Frank kills Sid to save Jenny (Vinnie offers to do the deed, but Frank turns him down).

====&quot;Romp&quot;====
Vinnie and Mooch attend the bachelor party of their friend Jimmy Vitale, and loan Jimmy the money to get out from under a loan shark&#x27;s thumb.

==Main characters==
===Vincent Terranova===
Vincent Michael &quot;Vinnie&quot; Terranova (Ken Wahl) is an undercover agent who is 30 years old when the series begins. His job is to infiltrate criminal organizations, gather evidence, and then destroy the organization to bring the guilty parties to justice. At the beginning of the series, he is estranged from his family because of an eighteen-month prison sentence (meant to establish his &quot;wiseguy&quot; credentials with the criminal underworld) and continued ties to criminals, and OCB regulations forbade Vinnie from telling his family the truth. However, his brother Peter (Gerald Anthony), a Catholic priest, knew the truth (Vinnie had revealed everything under the seal of the confessional), and in the first season episode &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; when his Italian-born mother Carlotta (Elsa Raven) is hospitalized after being mugged, Vinnie reveals the truth to her (with McPike and Lifeguard concealing Vinnie&#x27;s confession from the OCB Regional Director), thereby reconciling mother and son. Carlotta calls him &quot;Vincenzo&quot; but his legal name is Vincent. Vinnie was often seen wearing Fordham University sweatshirts and hats as he and Peter are Fordham graduates.

===Frank McPike===
Frank McPike (Jonathan Banks) is Vinnie&#x27;s superior officer, who assigns Vinnie to cases, supplies him with important information and coordinates backup support. He became OCB Regional Director (RD) and Vinnie&#x27;s immediate superior after Vinnie was released after completing an eighteen-month sentence in the Newark State Penitentiary (Frank was responsible for ensuring that Vinnie served the full term in order to cement his cover). Since McPike is a known law enforcement official and Vinnie is deep undercover, McPike will often have Vinnie arrested on a trumped-up charge so that he can talk to Vinnie without revealing his identity. Frank has a troubled marriage. He separates from his wife after diverting some money recovered from a gangster to pay for a liver transplant for her.

===Daniel Benjamin &quot;Lifeguard&quot; Burroughs===
Lifeguard (Jim Byrnes), with whom Vinnie communicates almost exclusively by telephone, is Vinnie&#x27;s other contact person. Vinnie (ideally) calls him every morning with the latest updates on the case, and Lifeguard provides him with quick updates. He also, under the name of &quot;Mike Terranova&quot;, provides Vinnie with an emergency contact number (555-4958, a play on Vince&#x27;s agent number), without revealing Vinnie&#x27;s true identity. (The cover location is &quot;Sailor Hardware&quot;; the code phrase &quot;Uncle Mike&quot; indicates an emergency request for assistance.) Daniel is a double-leg amputee who uses a wheelchair, and on occasion prosthetic legs. Like McPike, Daniel is divorced as a result of his work; his ex-wife stays in close contact, apparently because Daniel has resources she wants, and Daniel endures this with resentment. Eventually he forms a relationship with OCB&#x27;s West Coast Lifeguard operator when Vinnie&#x27;s investigations take him to Washington State.

===Michael Santana===
Appears in season 4 only as the focal character in Terranova&#x27;s absence, Santana (Steven Bauer) is a recently disbarred United States Attorney who becomes allies with McPike and the OCB.

===Hillary Stein===
Appears in season 4 only Stein (Cecil Hoffman) as Santana&#x27;s fellow U.S. Attorney and love interest.

==Episodes==
===Series overview===
===Season 1 (1987–88)===
===Season 2 (1988–89)===
===Season 3 (1989–90)===
===Season 4 (1990)===
== TV film ==

In 1996, ABC commissioned a film with the possibility of a revival series in the works. Ken Wahl, Jonathan Banks, and Jim Byrnes all reprised their roles.

In order to explain the disappearance of Vinnie, a story was devised which effectively 
retconned the series and disregarded the events of season four. Following his desertion after witnessing Stem&#x27;s suicide during the Volchek case in Washington state, as well as his problems with his stepfather, the FBI pulled Vinnie out of OCB and reassigned him to a wiretapping detail where he was still working at the time the film began.

Vinnie is ordered to infiltrate the organization of criminal boss Paul Callendar (Ted Levine). The movie had many of the same themes as the TV show, including Vinnie&#x27;s constant conflict in betraying the people he had grown to care about.

Under the title of &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, the TV movie premiered on May 2, 1996. While the movie was a critical success, ABC aired it against NBC&#x27;s Thursday night Must See TV lineup and it failed to draw many viewers. In addition, Wahl suffered a broken neck in 1992 in a fall that left him temporarily quadriplegic and by the time the &quot;Wiseguy&quot; reunion was commissioned, he had been in near constant pain after he regained the use of his arms and legs and would likely not have been physically capable to take on the demands of the role. Thus, the movie was the last time the original &quot;Wiseguy&quot; cast appeared in their roles. The movie was rerun on Sleuth in 2008.

While never released on VHS or DVD in the United States, the movie was released overseas on Video CD (MagnaVision CW071-003001) but is no longer commercially available.

== Home media/streaming/rebroadcast ==
In May 2009, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that they had acquired the rights to release &quot;Wiseguy&quot; on DVD in Region 1. They subsequently released the complete first season on August 25, 2009. On March 9, 2010, Mill Creek released &quot;Wiseguy: The Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, a 13-disc set featuring 67 episodes from all four seasons. However, due to rights issues with the music contained in the show, the &quot;Dead Dog Records&quot; arc from Season 2 (seven of 22 episodes) is not included.

Beyond Home Entertainment has released all four seasons on DVD in Region 4, again without the &quot;Dead Dog Records&quot; arc episodes.

On August 12, 2022, Visual Entertainment released &quot;Wiseguy: The Complete Collection&quot;, a 14-disc set that features, for the first time on DVD, all 75 episodes of the series.


The first season became available on iTunes on April 28, 2008.

As of 2022, the series, except the &quot;Dead Dog Records&quot; arc, is available on Peacock and Tubi. Other streaming options include: Roku, Pluto, FILMRISE, freevee, and Amazon Prime.

As of 2022, the series is being rebroadcast on Circle and Ace TV. Circle is showing all 75 episodes, including the episodes in the &quot;Dead Dog Records&quot; arc. As of 2023, the series is being rebroadcast on Retro TV, also including the episodes in the &quot;Dead Dog Records&quot; arc.

==Reception==
&quot;Wiseguy&quot; has been cited alongside its contemporary &quot;Crime Story&quot; as breaking ground for the lengthy crime stories which thrived on television during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In 1997 &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the episode &quot;Blood Dance&quot; number 14 on its &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot; list.

A 2008 &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; retrospective on &quot;The 50 Biggest Emmy Snubs&quot; (TV shows and performances regarded by the publication as deserving Emmy Awards which did not receive them) ranked Ray Sharkey in the role of Sonny Steelgrave as #26 and Kevin Spacey in the role of Mel Profitt as #44.

<doc id="920619" wikidata="Q6942098" url="?curid=920619" title="Music of Grenada">
<text>The music of Grenada has included the work of several major musicians, including Eddie Bullen, David Emmanuel, one of the best-selling reggae performers ever, and Mighty Sparrow, a calypsonian. The island is also known for jazz, most notably including Eddie Bullen, a pianist, songwriter and record producer currently residing in Canada. Kingsley Etienne, a keyboardist, while the Grenadan-American Joe Country &amp; the Islanders have made a name in country music.

African dances brought to Grenada survive in an evolved form, as have European quadrilles and picquets. Some of the most popular recent styles of these dances include &quot;Heel-and-Toe&quot; and &quot;Carriacou Big Drum and Quadrille&quot;, with popular dancers including Willie Redhead, Thelma Phillips, Renalph Gebon and the Beewee Ballet.

Independence in 1974 launched a Grenadian national identity which was exemplified in the calypso of the time, which tended to be intensely patriotic. More modern calypso performers have experimented, using political commentary and poetry to expand the possibilities of Grenadian calypso. Indian influences have also changed the sound of Grenadian calypso.

== Popular music ==
Popular forms of music in Grenada are calypso, soca and to a lesser extent reggae and dancehall. 
Soca produced in Grenada has a distinct style that takes the name of &quot;jab jab&quot; soca.

== Carriacou ==
Many years of domination by the British and the French have left behind influences in Carriacou, in songs like lullabies and reels, cantique, chanteys and quadrilles.

Carriacou is an island north of Grenada, best known for the Big Drum Afro-Caribbean song-style and Quadrille. Big Drum dates back to at least the late 18th century. Carriacou&#x27;s population is divided into nations, each of which has a distinct rhythm that identifies it; Big Drum glorifies the ancestors of these nations, which include the Manding, Chamba, Temne, Moko, Igbo, Banda, Arada, Kongo and Cromanti. The Cromanti, being the biggest nation, begins the Big Drum ceremony with a song called &quot;Cromanti Cudjo&quot; (or &quot;Beg Pardon&quot;); this is followed by the other nations&#x27; songs, all of which are based on short, declamatory phrases with choruses, accompanied by two &quot;boula&quot; drums and a single, higher-pitched &quot;cut drum&quot;, both of which are made from rum barrels. Big Drum music is used to honor the memory of the dead if the deceased&#x27;s family is not able to have the traditional Tombstone Feast.

Quadrille was developed in France during the 18th century as a court dance for Napoleon, the Quadrille was brought to England, and then introduced to the colonial Caribbean during the early 19th century, providing entertainment on social occasions for planters.
Slaves were forbidden to practice their culture, as the planters realized their music and dance were used to communicate, and to plan their release strategies. However, to save on the expenses of bringing musicians from England, slaves were engaged to provide music for planters’ parties. Forbidden to practice their own dances, African musicians and house workers learned the dance of the English planters, taking it into their camps and altering it. Slaves used the Quadrille to mock the planters but more importantly used this newly approved dancing time to secretly formulate uprisings to hasten their freedom. Carriacou versions of the Quadrille feature four men and four women, forming a square and are accompanied by tambourine, bass drum, violin and triangle. Dance styles can be either formal, with couples gliding rigidly in turn, or a more free style where all couples dance at the same time with unfettered movements and improvisations.
This dance surpasses the Big Drum in rhythm but does not have the variety and the significance of the African Nation Dance. You can view these dances at cultural celebrations.

The funeral music of Carriacou is a major part of the island&#x27;s folk music; Carriacouan religion centers on reverence for the &quot;Old Parents&quot;, the apocryphal founders of the island&#x27;s society. The saraca funerary rite, practiced on Carriacou and throughout the Grenadines, involves music, storytelling and feasting; saraca songs include both European and African lyrics. African elements, such as the call-and-response style, are often present.

<text>Pupin is a tiny lunar impact crater located in the eastern part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after Serbian-American physicist Mihajlo Pupin. It lies to the southeast of the crater Timocharis, and was identified as Timocharis K prior to being renamed by the IAU. The mare near Pupin is otherwise devoid of significant impact craters, and is nearly featureless except for a faint dusting of ray material.

<doc id="920634" wikidata="Q777561" url="?curid=920634" title="BinHex">
<text>BinHex, originally short for &quot;binary-to-hexadecimal&quot;, is a binary-to-text encoding system which was used on the classic Mac OS for sending binary files over email. BinHexed files take up more space than the original files, but avoid data corruption by software that is not 8-bit clean.

== History ==

=== TRS-80 BinHex ===

BinHex was originally written in 1981 by Tim Mann for the TRS-80 computer, as a standalone version of the encoding scheme of the popular terminal emulator &quot;ST80-III&quot;, for users of other terminals. It was used for sending files via major online services such as CompuServe which, not being 8-bit clean, required files to use ASCII armoring to survive. The system became very popular after Mann uploaded it to CompuServe&#x27;s TRS-80 files area.

The original scheme converted the binary file contents to hexadecimal numbers, encoding those as ASCII digits and letters (codice_1–codice_2, codice_3–codice_4), and adding a newline after every 60 characters. The system quickly gained the addition of a checksum at the end of every line to check for errors, and a subsequent conversion to use the BASIC/S compiler allowed it to run much faster than the original interpreted version.

BinHex files of the era were typically given the file extension . Ports soon appeared for other popular computers of the era, including the Apple II. When CompuServe later added support for 8-bit transfers, the format fell out of use.

=== Mac BinHex ===

When the Macintosh 128K was released in January 1984, the file upload problem still existed on CompuServe. In April, BinHex was ported to the Mac using MS BASIC for Macintosh. The Macintosh File System had introduced the storage of files as a &quot;resource fork&quot; and &quot;data fork&quot;, and the Macintosh port only supported encoding of files&#x27; data fork, meaning it could only be used for data files. Several newer versions were published during 1984, resulting in BinHex 3 which could encode both forks.

Yves Lempereur, author of the first assembler for the Mac, MacASM, ported BinHex 3 to assembly language, increasing its speed a hundred-fold, and released it as BinHex 1.0.

=== Compact BinHex ===

The simplicity of the original BinHex format made it inefficient, expanding every byte of input into two, as required by the hexadecimal representation, an 8-to-4 bit encoding. Lempereur implemented a new 8-to-6 bit encoding, which decreased file size by 50% and expanded the checksum from 8 to 16-bits, releasing this as BinHex 2.0.

The new encoding used the first 64 ASCII printing characters, including the space, to represent the data, similarly to uuencoding. As the smaller files were incompatible with the older format, Lempereur changed the file extension to , with &quot;c&quot; meaning &quot;compact&quot;. The name BinHex did not change, despite the format no longer being a hexadecimal representation.

=== BinHex 4 and 5 ===

In 1985 Lempereur released BinHex 4.0, skipping 3.0 to avoid confusion with a similarly-numbered version of BASIC. This version performed the following sequence of operations:

* Generate cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) for the data fork, resource fork, and file metadata, instead of a single checksum
* Combine the forks and metadata with their checksums into a common 8-bit format
* Apply run-length encoding to provide some compression
* Perform the 8-to-6 bit conversion.

The resulting files were roughly the same size as those from BinHex 2, but much more robust, with the metadata information in the header being protected from corruption by no longer being in plain text. The file extension for this new format was .

At about the same time, most online services had started to support robust 8-bit file transfer protocols such as ZMODEM. This obviated the need for ASCII armoring, but on the Macintosh there was still the need to encode the two forks into one, leading to the development of the MacBinary file format. Lempereur released BinHex 5.0, which only differed by using MacBinary to combine the forks, but it saw little use.

=== Internet usage ===

While the Internet was gaining popularity in the 1990s, email was still the primary method of moving files. Relatively few people had full access, and services like FTPmail were the only way many users could download files. Consequently, binary files still required encoding, and BinHex 4.0 remained a popular tool for doing so into the late 1990s. BinHexed files can still be found today in archives of classic Mac OS software.

== BinHex 4 file format ==

A BinHex file may begin with any text content, followed by a line which indicates the format of the file, and that binary data is about to begin: &quot;(This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)&quot;. The text preceding that line is ignored when the file is converted out of BinHex format.

The binary data is encoded to 7-bit ASCII characters, with three bytes of input (24 bits) divided into four 6-bit values, in a similar fashion to Base64 encoding but using a different set of characters. 
The encoded data has a colon () placed before and after it, and is split into lines of a maximum of 64 characters in length.

<text>Terence Ian Fytton Armstrong (29 June 1912 – 23 September 1970), better known as John Gawsworth (and also sometimes known as T. I. F. Armstrong), was a British writer, poet and compiler of anthologies, both of poetry and of short stories. He also used the pseudonym Orpheus Scrannel (alluding to the &quot;scrannel pipes&quot; in Milton&#x27;s &quot;Lycidas&quot;). He declared himself king of the unrecognized micronation of the Kingdom of Redonda in 1947, and started calling himself King Juan I.

==Early life==
Armstrong grew up in Colville Gardens, Notting Hill, and at number 40 Royal Crescent, Holland Park, London. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School.

==Career==
As a very young man he moved in London literary circles championing traditional verse and writing as opposed to modernism. He ran the Twyn Barlwm Press, a small press publishing some well-known poets, its title inspired by the mountain Twyn Barlwm in South Wales, beloved by one of his literary idols Arthur Machen. Machen was one of the surviving writers of the 1890s he admired and befriended. Gawsworth&#x27;s longest piece of written work was a biography of Machen, but he could find no publisher for it in the thirties. It was finally published by Tartarus Press in 2005.

Other writers Gawsworth admired were Edgar Jepson and M. P. Shiel, whose literary executor he would later become.

In 1931 he had the poem &quot;In Winter&quot; by W. H. Davies privately printed in a limited edition of 290 numbered copies, illustrated by Edward Carrick and all individually signed by Davies. A further special limited edition of 15 were printed on handmade paper and also hand-coloured by Carrick. Three companion titles appeared in similar editions at the same time: &quot;In Spring&quot; by Edith Sitwell, &quot;In Summer&quot; by Edmund Blunden and &quot;In Autumn&quot; by Herbert Palmer.

He gave Hugh MacDiarmid a roof over his head in London in 1934 (MacDiarmid returned the compliment in &quot;When the Rat-Race Is Over; an essay in honour of the fiftieth birthday of John Gawsworth&quot; (1962)). At this time he was very much involved in compiling (usually anonymously) story collections, generally of the fiction of the supernatural. Poetry collections of this time were &quot;Lyrics to Kingcup&quot; (1932), &quot;Mishka and Madeleine. A Poem Sequence for Marcia&quot; (1932), &quot;Poems 1930–1932&quot; (1936), &quot;New Poems&quot; 1939. Later he published through the Richards Press.

He met and befriended the young Lawrence Durrell in 1932, when Gawsworth was living in Denmark Street. He made friends as well as enemies (Dylan Thomas, George Woodcock) throughout literary London.

===World War II===
During World War II, he served, under the alias T E Shavian, in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman in North Africa (T. E. Shaw being the postwar name adopted by T. E. Lawrence). As one of the Cairo poets, he made a more serious name for himself, being part of the group. Later he returned to a picturesque eccentricity as a Fitzrovian. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in 1949. A later volume is &quot;Toreros&quot; (1990).

The &quot;Known Signatures&quot; anthology (reactionary, quite literally) was prompted by the Michael Roberts &quot;New Country&quot; collection. The &quot;Edwardian Poetry Book One&quot; (1936) (edited anonymously) and &quot;Neo-Georgian Poetry 1936–1937&quot; (edited anonymously by Gawsworth ) are extraordinary for their retrospective vision.

===King of Redonda===
As literary executor to M. P. Shiel, Armstrong also inherited the throne of the Kingdom of Redonda styling himself H.M. Juan I. The independent publisher Jon Wynne-Tyson became Gawsworth&#x27;s literary executor in 1970, also becoming H.M. Juan II but Wynne-Tyson &quot;abdicated&quot; in favour of the Spanish novelist and translator Javier Marías— H.M. Xavier I – who became both Shiel&#x27;s and Gawsworth&#x27;s literary executor.

According to John Sutherland&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Novelists&quot;, &quot;the excessively minor poet John Gawsworth&quot; kept the ashes of M. P. Shiel &quot;in a biscuit tin on his mantelpiece, dropping a pinch as condiment into the food of any particularly honoured guest&quot;.

<text>Three Leaning Men were a New Zealand 1980s indie band from Palmerston North who recorded one LP, &quot;Fun in the Key of E&quot;, released by Meltdown Records. The band&#x27;s debut performance was supporting Sneaky Feelings at the Massey University Social Hall. They also supported Hunters and Collectors, the Chills and New Order.

The band was formed by Lindsay Gregg (guitar), Rhys Bevan (bass) and Nigel Corbett (drums) and joined by second guitarist Greg Malcolm. Rhys Bevan was replaced by Alan Gregg during the recording of their album. Alan Gregg went on to feature in a number of other New Zealand bands, including the Dribbling Darts of Love, the Mutton Birds and Marshmallow. Rhys Bevan moved to the South Island of New Zealand to continue his career as a baker. Lindsay Gregg died in 2011.

<text>Spurr is the lava-flooded remains of a lunar impact crater. It was named after American geologist Josiah Edward Spurr. It is located in the midst of the Palus Putredinis plain, to the southeast of the crater Archimedes. Only the southern half of the rim protrudes significantly through the lunar mare material, while the northern section of the wall has a resemblance to a ghost crater rim.

The formation was known as Archimedes K before being renamed by the IAU.

<text>Madison Park is an 8.3 acre (34,000 m2) park in the Madison Park neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, located between the western shore of Lake Washington on the east, 42nd Avenue E. on the west, E. Madison Street on the north, and E. Blaine Street on the south. 43rd Avenue E. divides it into two sections; the east is a swimming beach and public dock, and the west is a playground, playfield, and tennis courts. Next to the beach is Madison Park Co-op, a community playhouse for toddlers and children.

For the first 19 years of its existence, the Madison Street Cable Railway ran on Madison Street from Elliott Bay to the park. Service was cut back to 21st Avenue in 1910. There was also ferry service on Lake Washington from the early 1880s to August 31, 1950 from Madison Park across the lake to Kirkland. (The construction of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge in 1940 had greatly reduced demand and the continued existence of the run could no longer be justified after tolls were removed in 1949.)

==Steamboat landing==
From about 1890 to 1910 Madison Park was also a landing for steamboats which ran on Lake Washington.

<text>Meltdown Records was a small independent record label based in Palmerston North, New Zealand, that operated from 1985 to 1989. It was owned by Massey University student Peter Shepherd, later Professor of Cell Signalling, Molecular Medicine and Pathology at the University of Auckland and awardee of the Callaghan Medal in 2017, and part funded by the Massey University Students Association.

The label was &quot;steered by&quot; Massey University-based bands Dosage B, the Mannequins and the Remarkables. During its four years of operation, Meltdown released 10 records. Its first recording was by for Dosage B, a band led by Jeremy Corbett, who subsequently became a well known radio host in New Zealand. It recorded an EP by the Remarkables and the album &quot;Fun in the Key of E&quot; by Three Leaning Men, these two groups being early bands of New Zealand musician Alan Gregg. Another was an EP by the Pterodactyls, which featured former Chills member Martin Kean. National Library of New Zealand information says that they also recorded the bands Thin Red Line, Cement Garden, the End, Iceland Bars, Polar Bears, Swiss Kids, Statmux, Harry Death, and Coloured Talk.

In 1986 Meltdown Records featured on TV show &quot;Video Dispatch&quot;. In March 1987 they organised and ran the Rheineck Rock Festival at the Palmerston North Showgrounds in conjunction with Radio 92.2XS Stereo FM Radio.

Meltdown&#x27;s demise began in 1987 when EMI closed in New Zealand, meaning that they were unable to get their records pressed at a reasonable cost. Releases were now costing $20 per record, but only retailing for $8 each. In 1989, after releasing &quot;Melter Smelter&quot;, Meltdown Records ceased production.

<text>The River Croal is a river located in Greater Manchester, England. It is a tributary of the River Irwell.

Rising at the confluence of Middle Brook and Deane Church Brook, it flows eastwards through Bolton, collecting &quot;Gilnow Brook&quot; and the larger &quot;River Tonge&quot; at Darcy Lever. Most of the river is culverted through Bolton town centre, running under Knowsley Street, Market Place and Bridge Street.
Before 1836, the River Croal formed the boundary between the townships of Great and Little Bolton.

The name of the river is derived from the Old English &quot;croh&quot; and &quot;wella&quot;, the winding stream. It was possibly originally called the Middlebrook along its entire length as early references mention the &quot;Mikelbrok&quot;, (&quot;mycel&quot; and &quot;broc&quot;), the great stream but not the Croal.

It meets the Irwell at Nob End, Kearsley after a total course of around ten miles.

<text>Meinerzhagen (; sometimes spelled Meinertzhagen) is a town in the Märkischer Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Meinerzhagen is located in the hills of the Sauerland. The highest elevation is the Nordhelle with 652 m above sea level, the lowest elevation at the Lister dam with 319m. 56% of the town area is covered by forests.

=== Neighbouring municipalities===
=== Division of the town ===
The town consists of the following villages and places:
==History==
In 1765 Meinerzhagen received city rights from King Frederick II of Prussia, however in 1865 the city abandoned them to save administrative costs. In 1846 the &quot;Amt Meinerzhagen&quot; was formed, covering both Meinerzhagen and the municipality of Valbert. On September 19, 1964, Meinerzhagen received city rights again.

In the communal reform of the district Altena in 1969, Meinerzhagen was merged with Valbert, the &quot;Amt Meinerzhagen&quot; was dissolved.

The family name of the British World War I officer Richard Meinertzhagen recalls an ancestor who came from this town.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Meinerzhagen shows a red lion as the symbol of the Duchy of Berg, placed on a blue St. Andrew&#x27;s cross on yellow ground, referring to the family von Badinghagen, which became extinct in the 17th century. The bottom part of the coat of arms shows the red-and-white-chequered bordure as the symbol of the Mark. A yellow horn is placed on top of the bordure, taken from the coat of arms of the municipality of Valbert. The coat of arms was granted on June 14, 1975.

Before the merging of Meinerzhagen and Valbert, the two towns as well as the &quot;Amt Meinerzhagen&quot; had their individual coats of arms. The coat of arms of Meinerzhagen dates back to at least 1857, as the town hall, built in 1857, already showed the coat of arms above its entrance. The coat of arms had a green bottom part, top left Saint Mary on a throne, holding a scepter, with Jesus as an infant, and top right a building with three towers and red roofs, and the sun and two stars above.

The coat of arms of the municipality of Valbert showed both the chequered bordure as well as the black cross of Cologne in the bottom part, as the municipality consisted of parts of the Mark as well as of the Electorate of Cologne. The top part shows a hunter, which, similar to the coat of arms of the neighboring municipality of Herscheid refers to the hunting privilege granted by John III, Duke of Cleves, the heir of the Duke of Mark. The coat of arms was designed by Otto Hupp, and was granted on October 27, 1935.

The coat of arms of the &quot;Amt Meinerzhagen&quot; combined symbols of the three historic states of the area. The bottom part shows the black cross of Cologne, the middle part the chequered bordure of the Mark, and the top the lion of Berg.

== Notable people ==
* Lars Labonte, soccer player
* Nuri Şahin, played for the soccer team of Meinerzhagen before joining professional soccer team Borussia Dortmund
* Jasmin Selberg,a Model who won The Miss International Price in 2022

== International relations ==
From 1961 to 2001 Meinerzhagen had a partnership with the Dutch municipality IJsselmuiden. In 2001 IJsselmuiden was incorporated into the city Kampen, which subsequently continued the partnership.

On April 12, 1987, the documents were signed for the partnership with the French town Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire.

== Transportation ==

Meinerzhagen is situated at the Oberbergische Bahn and offers hourly connections to Cologne and (status October 2019) every two hours a direct train to Lüdenscheid, with connections to Hagen and Dortmund.

He began performing in public from the age of eight and took part in regional tournaments in his teens. He began playing with symphony orchestras in his teen years, including the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. He worked for a short time as a conductor and then broke into orchestral work as a player through the 1960s. Gibson played with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. His association with the London orchestras was lifelong and involved numerous recordings.

==Career==

===Early session work===

Gibson thought that his first pop recording session might have been Delilah (Tom Jones song) in 1967. http://cherryblossomclinic.x10.mx/wilf.html In 1970, Gibson played lead violin on Centipede&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Septober Energy&quot;. The following year, he gave multiple contributions to King Crimson&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Islands&quot;. He played violin in a small orchestra which performed &quot;Prelude - Song of the Gulls&quot;, of which he was practically the leader, due to the fact that band leader and composer of the track Robert Fripp was less than qualified as an orchestral conductor (even to the extent of using a pencil as the baton). He also added violin in other places such as on the opening track &quot;Formentera Lady&quot;. Despite his contributions, he went uncredited.

===With Electric Light Orchestra===

In 1972, Gibson replaced original ELO violinist Steve Woolam and performed in their first live concert at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey. Gibson would later play violin on the &quot;ELO II&quot; album, including on their cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, which became a top ten hit in the UK in September 1973.

However, by 1973, he had begun to be gradually replaced by Mik Kaminski, who played violin on much of the first side of ELO&#x27;s 1973 LP &quot;On the Third Day&quot;. Still, Gibson was able to play on the tracks &quot;Showdown&quot;, &quot;Daybreaker&quot;, &quot;Ma-Ma-Ma Belle&quot;, &quot;Dreaming of 4000,&quot; and the band&#x27;s cover of Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, as well as the various interludes in between tracks.

After this album, Gibson&#x27;s time in ELO came to an end. After leaving the group, Gibson declined an invitation to join King Crimson as a replacement for violinist David Cross.

===Later session work, ELO Part II, and other projects===

In 1975, Gibson was a string arranger and conductor for two songs on Maxine Nightingale&#x27;s album &quot;Right Back Where We Started From&quot; including its title track.

In 1989, he was the violinist in the BBC Radio 3 musical drama &quot;Notes from Janàcek&#x27;s Diary&quot;. He contributed to the Hothouse Flowers album &quot;Home&quot; (1990), and to The Beloved&#x27;s &quot;Happiness&quot; (1995) as well as appearing on the Oasis hit &quot;Whatever&quot;.

In 1991, Gibson was reunited with some of his old ELO bandmates when he played as part of the session orchestra for ELO Part II&#x27;s self-titled album, though his contributions were uncredited. He would also join them on 1994&#x27;s Moment of Truth, but this would mark the end of his involvement with any ELO-related groups.

Later, Gibson played in Alan Gout&#x27;s Berkeley Square Society Band, which played covers of songs from the 1920s and 1930s. The group released an album, &quot;Gershwin in London Town&quot; on the Zah Zah record label in 1998.

==Death==

Gibson died in 2014 after a short illness.

<doc id="920661" wikidata="Q7547506" url="?curid=920661" title="Sneaky Feelings">
<text>Sneaky Feelings are a New Zealand pop rock band which releases on the Flying Nun Records music label. The band formed in 1980 with the line-up of Matthew Bannister (guitar &amp; vocals), David Pine (guitar &amp; vocals), Kat Tyrie (bass guitar &amp; vocals) and Martin Durrant (drums &amp; vocals). Tyrie was replaced by John Kelcher in 1984. Durrant was temporarily replaced by Ross Burge in 1988 for the band&#x27;s second tour of Europe.

Sneaky Feelings are unusual among Dunedin sound bands in that all four members of the band sing and write songs. The jangle sound of the guitars and layered vocals drew their influence from the music of the Byrds and the Beatles, and comparisons can be made with some of California&#x27;s Paisley Underground bands.

The band&#x27;s name comes from a song by Elvis Costello, &quot;Sneaky Feelings&quot;, which is on his first album &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977).

==History==
Sneaky Feelings were one of four Dunedin bands to reap the benefits of the newly formed Flying Nun label with the release of the &quot;Dunedin Double&quot; EP in 1982, alongside the Stones, the Verlaines and the Chills. Sneaky Feelings were drawn to a wider variety of musical styles than most early Flying Nun bands and were one of the first to experiment in the recording studio. However the multi-voiced harmonies of the band&#x27;s sound were not well-suited to the primitive recording conditions of early Flying Nun, so it is rarely captured at its best on the albums they released. The band&#x27;s biggest hit has been their single &quot;Husband House&quot; in 1985, which reached #16 on NZ charts.

After the demise of Sneaky Feelings in 1989, Bannister founded the Dribbling Darts. He later worked briefly with the Mutton Birds alongside Ross Burge. Subsequently, Bannister formed the band The Weather. He also wrote a book about the experience of being in a band during the heyday of the Dunedin sound movement - &quot;Positively George Street&quot;. Pine has returned sporadically to music, notably in the Dunedin-based band Death Ray Cafe in the late 1980s, but his involvement in music has been largely curtailed by his work in the New Zealand diplomatic corps. In June 2020 he was appointed New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to India. Sneaky Feelings briefly re-formed in 1992 to record several extra tracks and to tour to promote the CD release of &quot;Send You&quot;. They also re-formed to perform a one-off concert as part of a celebration of Dunedin music, held in that city in 2006. In early 2008, Kelcher formed The South Tonight with Richard James, who had also been in an early Flying Nun group, Mainly Spaniards. Kelcher later stood as a candidate for the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand in the 2014 New Zealand general election, for the Christchurch seat of Ilam.

While Sneaky Feelings may have not played much over the years, the individual members have continued to hone their songwriting skills. After a 29-year hiatus, the band released Progress Junction in 2017. It was recorded over two years in bass player John Kelcher&#x27;s Christchurch studio, with each band member contributing three tracks. They experimented with weaving in snippets of audio from New Zealand radio archives and voices from the past started talking to the present. Progress Junction received wide praise from critics at home, including the Sunday Star Times&#x27;s Jack Barlow who dubbed it &quot;a vibrant and fresh offering from one of New Zealand’s finest&quot; to William Dart (RNZ New Horizons ) who referred to the album as &quot;&quot;the unexpected renaissance of one of my favourite bands of all time&quot;.&quot; Nick Bollinger of RNZ wrote &quot;David Pine and Matthew Bannister, who wrote the first and second song respectively, were always the chief songwriters in the Sneakies and as these opening tracks show, neither has lost their touch. These songs are melodic and poetic, and often employ humour even when the subject is serious.&quot; He continued &quot;But they are not the only writers in the group. This band has always appeared to be that rare institution, a functioning democracy. All four members contribute songs, and in the past some of the best ones came from drummer Martin Durrant. It was his &#x27;Strangers Again&#x27; that Bic Runga covered so beautifully on her rarities set &quot;Try To Remember Everything&quot;, and his &#x27;You Never Know&#x27; is one of the standouts on this record. It could almost be some pre-rock’n’roll, Great American Songbook classic as interpreted by a 60s beat group. In a way it sums up the breadth of this band and the respect for the whole history and craft of popular song that has always come through in their music.

Sneaky Feelings&#x27;s latest LP is The Mercury Moment. It was released 17 April 2020 on Flying Nun Records and the quartet&#x27;s Bandcamp page. They announced the forthcoming 12 song LP after a rare performance on Waitangi Day 2020. The Mercury Moment is a &quot;...potent exploration of extinction, redundancy and disappointed dreams as the four songwriters cast their attention on the current state of the world.&quot;

Reviewer Graham Reid commented that The Mercury Moment is &quot;an album which deals with Big Picture issues and ideas (Heavenly Bodies which comes down from the stars to communicating online) and also drills down into the world we are given... which isn&#x27;t the one we might have expected or wished for... And this was written before Covid-19.&quot;

<doc id="920665" wikidata="Q16931692" url="?curid=920665" title="Music of the Virgin Islands">
<text>The music of the Virgin Islands reflects long-standing West Indian cultural ties to the island nations to the south, the islands&#x27; African heritage and European colonial history, as well as recent North American influences. Though the United States Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands are politically separate, they maintain close cultural ties. From its neighbors, the Virgin Islands has imported various pan-Caribbean genres of music, including calypso music and soca music from Trinidad and reggae from Jamaica.

The major indigenous form of music is the scratch band (also called &quot;Fungi band&quot; in the British Virgin Islands), which use improvised instruments like gourds and washboards to make a kind of music called &quot;Quelbe&quot;. A Virgin Island folk song called &#x27;cariso is also popular, as well as St. Thomas&#x27; bamboula. The quadrille is the traditional folk dance of the islands, and include varieties like St. Croix&#x27;s Imperial Quadrille and St. Thomas&#x27; Flat German Quadrille. The Heritage Dancers are a respected dance troupe that perform traditional folk dances from the Virgin Islands and beyond.

== Characteristics ==
Virgin Islander culture is syncretic, based primarily on African, European and North American cultures. Though the Danish controlled the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands for many years, the dominant language has been an English-based Creole since the 19th century, and the islands remain much more receptive to English language popular culture than any other. The Dutch, the French and the Danish also contributed elements to the island&#x27;s culture, as have immigrants from the Arab world, India and other Caribbean islands. The single largest influence on modern Virgin Islander culture, however, comes from the Africans enslaved to work in canefields from the 17th to the mid-19th century. These African slaves brought with them traditions from across a wide swathe of Africa, including what is now Nigeria, Senegal, both Congos, Gambia and Ghana.

== Folk music ==
Virgin Islander folk music has declined since the mid-20th century, though some traditions, such as scratch bands, remain vibrant. Trends that contributed to this change include the rise of the tourism industry, the switch of American tourists from Cuba to the Virgin Islands following the 1959 revolution, and the growth of industries based on mass radio, television and recorded music. These changes &quot;(diluted) local traditions and (diverted) younger generations&quot; from becoming involved in folk music, because popular styles came to be viewed as having more prestige, class and income.

=== Scratch bands and fungi music ===

Scratch bands, also known as &quot;fungi bands&quot; and formerly &quot;string bands&quot;, are a distinctive form of folk ensemble; they have survived the decline of other Virgin Islander folk traditions, through adapting to newly imported instrumentation and songs, and becoming a part of a more general revival of interest in folk culture on the islands. The name &quot;scratch band&quot; may derive from the sound produced by scraping the &quot;squash&quot;, an instrument similar to the Puerto Rican &quot;guiro&quot;, but larger, or from the word &quot;squash&quot; itself, used to refer to the bands first by American visitors and then by locals.

The traditional scratch band ensemble varied, but always used a percussive instrument, either the &quot;squash&quot;, tambourine, or a local form of double-headed barrel drum similar to the Dominican tambora, as well as an accordion, cane flute or violin as a melodic instrument. String instruments were also common, including the banjo, ukulele or a six-string guitar. The &quot;ass pipe&quot;, made out of a car exhaust tube, often provided the bass, and was played similar to the tuba. Since about the 1980s, the instrumentation for scratch bands became more rigid. The alto saxophone became the most common melodic instrument, replaced sometimes by a silver flute. Conga drums, &quot;squash&quot;, electric guitar or bass guitar, and a &quot;steel&quot; (a triangle). Banjo or ukulele, keyboard and additional saxophones or other melodic instruments are more rarely found in modern bands.

The music of scratch bands are a type of folk music that dates back to the days of slavery. The slaves on the islands used everyday objects in order to fashion instruments. However, this was not unique to slaves as individuals like James &quot;Jamesie&quot; Brewster, considered by many as the King of Scratch in the Virgin Islands, recalls making his first banjo from an old sardine can, old white pine wood, and an old sack of flour to make twine. Lyrics traditionally function as oral history, spreading news and gossip. Modern scratch bands play a wide range of dances, including calypsos, boleros, quadrilles, international pop songs, merengues, mazurkas, waltzes, jigs and other styles. They perform at church services, private parties, public festivals, local dances and fairs, christenings and weddings, and also perform for tourists. The scratch band tradition remains most vibrant on St. Croix, where the bands Bully &amp; the Kafooners, Stanley &amp; the Ten Sleepless Knights, and Blinky &amp; the Roadmasters are well known. Scratch bands are less common on St. Thomas, and in the British Virgin Islands, though the popular Elmo &amp; the Sparkplugs hail from Tortola.

=== &quot;Quelbe&quot; ===
&quot;Quelbe&quot; is a form of topical folk song, and is the official music of the U.S. Virgin Islands. &quot;Quelbe&quot; is commonly performed by scratch bands, Stanley &amp; the Ten Sleepless Nights being the most popular throughout the Virgin Islands, though their folk origin lies in individuals, who sang the songs in informal settings, celebrations and festivals. The music in most cases involved true stories where the listeners can identify events that happen throughout a timeline. These songs typically contained sexual innuendos and double entendres, as well as other hidden meanings; common topics included political events, such as a boycott. One example from the early 20th century chastises a carousel owner for opposing a wage increase:

I rather walk and drink rum whole night 
Before me go ride on LaBega Carousel 
I rather walk, man, and drink rum whole night 
Before me go ride on LaBega Carousel 
You no hear what LaBega say 
&quot;The people no worth fifteen cent a day&quot; 
You no hear what LaBega say, man 
&quot;The people no worth more than half cent a day&quot;

=== Other folk styles ===
The quadrille is a folk dance that was formerly an important part of Virgin Islands culture; it is now rarely performed, except on St. Croix. There, locals dance the quadrille at public performance venues, such as St. Gerard&#x27;s Hall, or as educational spectacles for schools, festivals and holidays, or as entertainment for tourists. Educational and entertainment quadrille troops both wear traditionally styled clothing reminiscent of authentic attire.

The Virgin Islands tea meetings, the David and Goliath play and masquerade jig all probably derive from elsewhere in the Caribbean. The jig uses elements of theater, dance, music and oratory, and functions as simple entertainment with improvised jigs alternated with humorous monologues. Tea meetings are now only performed as reconstructions in folkloric ensembles; they were evenings of speech-making, feasting and the singing of hymns and parlor songs. The David and Goliath play features music, dance, theater, and dramatic and witty speeches, all based on the biblical story of David and Goliath.

The Afro-Virgin Islander &quot;bamboula&quot; tradition is now only performed in a reconstructed fashion. It was a style of song, drumming and folk dance, performed by two drummers on one drum; one drum used his hands and heel, and the other two sticks. African-styled dance and group song with refrains were a constant part, with verses frequently improvised by a soloist.

Traditional Virgin Islander folk music festivals were performed until the late 1950s. (&quot;mas&#x27;ing&quot;) was an important tradition, and consisted of groups wearing theme-based costumes, and playing melodies and rhythms that suggest their identity. Instruments included a fife-and-drum ensemble that featured a cane fife, double-headed bass drum (known as &quot;keg&quot; or &quot;boom-boom&quot;) and snare drum (known as &quot;kettledrum&quot;).

The Virgin Islander &quot;cariso&quot; tradition is extinct in a true folk context, but remains an important symbol of Crucian culture, and is performed by folkloric ensembles for educational and holiday events. &quot;Carisos&quot; were still performed as late as the 1990s by several elderly singers, most famously Ethel McIntosh and Leona Watson. Though similar in some ways to quelbe, &quot;cariso&quot; is more African in its melodic style, frequent sustained syllables and traditional performance context, namely women singing in groups in call-and-response. &quot;Carisos&quot;, like quelbe, commemorate historical events, and spread news and opinions about important issues. One particularly famous &quot;cariso&quot; dates to 1848, and documents the emancipation of the slaves; the first segment is the refrain, sung by a chorus, which is followed by a verse performed by a soloist singer:

Clear the road, all you clear the road,
Clear the road, let the slave them pass,
We a go for a-we freedom.

Hardship in the morning, suffering at night.
No one ever help us, it is only Father Ryan.
They bring we ya from Africa, that we bornin&#x27; land;

In the early 1900s, small groups left the small French island of St. Barths and traveled to St. Thomas, VI in search of work. Known throughout St. Thomas as &quot;Frenchies&quot; many played instruments such as the accordion, harmonica, ukulele and guitar and made instruments such as the &quot;Weero or Guiros&quot; out of dried squash from their farms and cowbells from their livestock.
Cyril Querrard of the Mountain Kings Band was a pioneer in promoting the music and sound of the French Virgin Islander. He had his own weekend show at the &quot;Luau Club&quot; on St. Thomas where he sang and played guitar for military personnel, tourists and locals alike. Because he lived on the peak of the island, he was once introduced as &quot;The King of the Mountain&quot; and the &quot;Mountain Kings&quot; band was later formed. Other local French descent bands later followed, such as, The Originals, Obsession Band and the Under Pressure band. These bands continued to have this unique sound as a result of this mix of cultures.

Shawn Querrard, lead singer of the Obsession band and son of Cyril Querrard, is known for his song writing ability. Songs like &quot;Gypsy Girl&quot;, &quot;Cherry tree&quot;, &quot;Chances&quot;, &quot;I had to let you know&quot; and &quot;Music Medicine&quot; has proven longevity and popularity in many of the Caribbean islands, particularly those of French influence.

== Modern and recently imported styles ==
Until the mid-20th century, the Virgin Islands were largely culturally isolated from international popular music. In the 1960s, a growth in tourism caused an influx of immigrants to fill the service positions the tourism industry created. These immigrants brought with them many styles of popular music, which were popularized by the growth of mass media in the islands, including television and radio.

By the 1980s, Virgin Islands was home to many imported styles, especially salsa, reggae, soca, merengue and rock. Jazz, Western classical music and musical theater, along with international pop stars, were common mainstream interests, while the islands&#x27; youth formed bands and dance troupes that played styles popular across the Caribbean, mainly Latin, Jamaican and Trinidadian influenced, such as salsa, reggae, steelpan and soca. The large Puerto Rican population in the Virgin Islands kept popular music from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic a major part of the islands&#x27; industry.

=== Calypso ===
The first calypso star from the Virgin Islands was Lloyd &quot;Prince&quot; Thomas, who moved to New York City in the mid-1940s and continued performing for some twenty years. Charles Harris, the Mighty Zebra (a well-known Trinidadian calypsonian) influentially performed in the Virgin Islands in the 1950s; he came for the Carnival in 1952, and stayed, playing at the Virgin Isles Hotel with the LaMotta Brothers Band. The LaMotta Band, led by Bill LaMotta, was a very popular group that recorded several albums and backed Mighty Zebra on a 1957 album for RCA Records. The remaining major early calypso band from the Virgin Islands was the Fabulous McClevertys, who toured widely across the East Coast of the United States at the height of the calypso craze in the late 1950s.

Another popular Virgin Islands calypsonian is Irvin &quot;Brownie&quot; Brown, who has hosted the islands&#x27; Carnival and has been a leading singer, radio entertainer, MC and drummer for many years. Originally from St. Thomas, he learned the timbales as a young man, and joined his uncle&#x27;s hotel band in 1949 or 1950. The band soon began performing in Florida and elsewhere, and Brownie became known as a calypso singer while also learning bongos, congas and a trap set. They recorded for Monogram and then Art Records, with Mighty Panther and the Haitian singer Calypso Mama. Brownie&#x27;s return to St. Thomas was followed by joining up with Milo &amp; the Kings, a well-known band, for whom he was a percussion for seventeen years, recording a number of albums and touring across North America and the Caribbean. He began working as a DJ for the WSTA radio station in 1966, and continued for more than three decades; he had a regular talk show with calypso performances, &quot;The Original Side of Walter and Brownie&quot;.

====Salsa====
In the 1950s through present day Milo and the Kings (Emile Francis - music director) kept Latin music alive, especially on St. Thomas. Milo and the Kings were famous for playing with such famous bands as El Gran Combo (Rafael Ithier - music director and Salsa Maestro to Milo), Tito Puente, Joe Cuba, Mongo Santa María, to name a few. Present day Milo&#x27;s Kings sometimes attempt to honor Milo with Salsa.
In 1998 Puerto Rico became the birthplace of Reggaeton music, a mix of Reggae and Latin music combined with Spanish Rap &amp; Reggae. Prominent Reggaeton Artist from the Virgin Islands include Kamakazi, Nicky Jam, Nene Ganja, Panty Man.

=== Soca ===
The Virgin Islands has been home to a number of well-known soca bands. Among the oldest and most respected are:
Milo &amp; The Kings, Mandingo Brass, Imaginations Brass, &amp; Eddie &amp; the Movements (later renamed the &quot;Awesome JamBand&quot;).

The &quot;Jam Band&quot; (formerly Eddie &amp; the Movements) are 20 time Road March Champions. The original &quot;Jam Band&quot; slowed up with the death of the band&#x27;s main front man Nick &#x27;Daddy&#x27; Friday who died in 2005. The Enforcements band hailed out of Monbijou, St. Croix (many members branched out to form different bands).

The Imaginations Brass was the first group to incorporate the used of electronic drums &amp; keyboard sequencers into their music. They started the trend &amp; other groups (such as Seventeen Plus &amp; the JamBand) later advanced the technique. It demonstrated the full use of the drum machines, electronic keyboards, vocals, and a bass line working together to set a new standard for Caribbean Music.

Other popular bands included: Seventeen Plus (17+); VIO International; Xpress Band (St. Croix Festival&#x27;s 2006-2007 Roadmarch Champions); Starlites; P&#x27;your Passion Band; Xtaushun Band (St. Croix Festival two-time Road March Champions).&quot;; Fusion Band(St. Croix Festival four-time Road March Champions); DJATC (Daddy Jones And The Crew); the Jammerz HP (formerly known as JDPP Jammerz); De Fabulous Stroka Band; Hyvoltage Band; Code 9; Xpress Band; Jam Tyme; UMB Soldiers; Rupsion Band; Spectrum Band (St. Thomas Carnival four-time Road March Champions); Kylo &amp; Stylee Band; and Pumpa &amp; The Unit have also made names for themselves.

=== Reggae ===
A reggae scene has been flourishing in the Virgin Islands, especially the island of St. Croix. The Virgin Islands reggae scene has achieved much popularity throughout the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, the United States, South America, Europe, and Africa. Prominent reggae artists from the Virgin Islands include Pressure, Midnite, Dezarie, Army, Abja, De Apostle, Niyorah, Emanuel, Bambu Station, Inner Visions, Sabbattical Ahdah, Eno, Revalation, Iba Wicked, Jah Rubal, Jah Croix, Exodus and many more. The reggae music of St. Croix has a distinct &quot;roots&quot; feeling and is strongly rooted in Rastafari. A prominent known reggae label in St. Croix is I Grade Records, who have released countless Midnite releases, two Dezarie albums, Niyorah albums, Army albums and Abja albums. Bambu Station guitarist Tuff Lion, along with Laurent Alfred of I Grade Records produce many of the tracks.

St. Croix also boasts a reggae radio station, WSTX 100.3 FM, which features Virgin Islands reggae.

=== Band music ===
European-based military band music first came to the Virgin Islands through ship-based bands as well as the small military ensembles of the Danish troops based in the islands. Regular band concerts were given by Danish musicians in Charlotte Amalie at least as early as 1888 at the Emancipation Garden bandstand. The Native Brass Band, reportedly the first official band of local musicians, was formed under the direction of Lionel Roberts in 1907, while the Adams Juvenile Band appeared in 1910 and would be inducted into the U.S. Navy when the service took over the administration of the islands from Denmark in 1917. The induction of this all-black unit into the U.S. Navy was remarkable for its time and thus recognized the first black musicians in the U.S. Navy since the War of 1812. The United States Navy Band of the Virgin Islands gave regular public concerts on St. Thomas until the departure of the naval administration in 1931, and not long after its founding two additional navy band units were stationed on St. Croix. Alton Augustus Adams Sr., the founder of the Juvenile Band and the bandmaster of the Navy ensemble, also wrote the Virgin Islands March (1919), now the official territorial anthem of the Virgin Islands, as well as The Governor&#x27;s Own, the official march of the Virgin Islands Governor. With the exception of a single surviving bamboula arrangement, Adams&#x27;s marches are entirely in the standard American march style of his idol, John Philip Sousa.

=== Hip-hop ===
There has been the development of a hip-hop scene in the Virgin Islands, specifically on the islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and Tortola. There is also a burgeoning hip-hop scene among Virgin Islands artists in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Prominent Virgin Islands hip-hop artists include Iyaz from Tortola, Rock City, Verse Simmonds from St. Thomas, K&#x27;Are from Tortola, Virgin Islands, British of the CB 4 Lyfe camp who also does Solo but is still a member of CB and the VI centered hip hop group Dem Rude Boyz.

== Institutions and festivals ==
The two most prominent music institutions in the Virgin Islands are the Island Center (on St. Croix) and the Reichold Center (on St. Thomas). Both these centers provide a venue for concerts of Western classical music, jazz, musical theater and international pop stars. St. Croix is also home to a public performance venue in St. Gerald&#x27;s Hall in Frederiksted, where locals dance quadrilles and otherwise perform.

Traditional Virgin Islander folk music festivals were performed until the late 1950s, and featured costumed masquerading. With the advent of formal parades and village festivals, local folk traditions declined, replaced by pan-Caribbean elements like calypso, moko jumbie stilt dancers and visiting performers from other islands.

== Education ==
There are Virgin Islander institutions that support and promote the islands&#x27; folk heritage. Bradley Christian&#x27;s St. Croix Heritage Dancers, for example, are folkloric group, one of several quadrille ensembles that offer a &quot;compact, staged rendition&quot; of folk traditions, along with educational narration.

Music education in the Virgin Islands is focused primarily on the Western classical tradition, particularly orchestral and concert band music. Local folk music is also a part of the music curriculum; quadrilles are taught in schools in St. Croix, and Charlotte Amalie High School on St. Thomas is home to a well-known student scratch band.

== Historiography and musicology ==
There is a paucity of historical documentation and musicological research and analysis of Virgin Islander music. The sound recordist Mary Jane Soule and ethnomusicologist Margot Lieth-Philipp collaborated on an annotated CD, &quot;Zoop Zoop Zoop: Traditional Music and Folklore of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John&quot;; these liner notes are among the comprehensive descriptions of folk music known. Lieth-Phillipp has also published some other material, on &quot;bamboula&quot; (which she refers to as a &quot;forgotten&quot; style of Caribbean music) and other topics. The loca and the Smithsonian Institution have also documented some folk traditions, but their research remains largely unpublished. Carmen Nibbs-O&#x27;Garra, wife of well-known Antiguan calypsonian Figgy, is the author of &quot;In de Calypso Tent&quot;, which, though perhaps no longer available, contains information of calypso competitions of St. Thomas and also reproduces the lyrics of popular Virgin Islands calypsos, and historical programs from past calypso tents on the islands. While not a scholarly history of the islands&#x27; musical life, &quot;The Memoirs of Alton Augustus Adams Sr.: First Black Bandmaster of the United States Navy&quot; were recently published by the University of California Press in a scholarly edition by Mark Clague. This book offers a first-hand account of musical life in the Virgin Islands from the 1900s through the 1950s. Adams&#x27;s remembrances are surprisingly precise as in addition to his musical activities, he worked as a journalist and much of his writing is based upon the articles and notes he penned for &quot;The St. Thomas Times&quot; and &quot;The Bulletin&quot; as well as &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot;.

<text>Richard Matthew Bannister (born 16 March 1957) is a British media executive and broadcaster.

==Early career==
After attending King Edward VII School, Sheffield, he graduated in law at the University of Nottingham in 1978, and joined BBC Radio Nottingham as a trainee reporter and subsequently the presenter of its speech-based breakfast show, &quot;Morning Report&quot;. It was here that he first met Trevor Dann, whom he subsequently worked with at BBC Radio 1.

He first worked for Radio 1 as a presenter of its news programme &quot;Newsbeat&quot; between 1983 and 1985. He worked for Capital Radio as a journalist in the early 1980s, later returning as head of news and talks after leaving Radio 1. He was also co-presenter with Sarah Ward of Capital Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Way It Is&quot;.

==Managerial career==
Bannister first established himself as a name in the radio industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s as managing editor of GLR (Greater London Radio), the BBC&#x27;s local radio station for London. Here he worked for the first time with Chris Evans, who was pioneering many of the ideas which would later win him greater success and much controversy at Radio 1, and also employed a number of the more musically credible DJs from Radio 1&#x27;s past, such as Annie Nightingale, Tommy Vance, Janice Long and Johnnie Walker. The line-up also included Danny Baker, Emma Freud and Chris Morris.

After working for two years in the BBC corporate centre on projects related to the renewal of the BBC&#x27;s Royal Charter, in 1993 Bannister was chosen as the new controller for BBC Radio 1, replacing Johnny Beerling who had worked at the station since its inception in 1967. Many of the DJs, producers and other staff at Radio 1 had grown old with the station, as had the audience. Keen to return the station to its original purpose for &quot;young listeners&quot;, Bannister overhauled the staff, resulting in many presenters either resigning or being sacked, and replacing them with new presenters. Over the next few years the station lost approximately 5 million listeners.

The Britpop explosion proved the success of Bannister&#x27;s strategy: the bands he had championed a year or two earlier, when they were comparatively obscure and marginal, were now part of the mainstream, and Radio 1 was booming again. Chris Evans, who had become a hugely popular national figure as breakfast DJ, was the figurehead of this boom, but eventually things went sour; in January 1997 Evans resigned after Bannister refused to allow him to waive his Friday show, to concentrate on his TV show &quot;TFI Friday&quot;. After Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley had an unsuccessful stint on the breakfast show, the team of Kevin Greening and Zoe Ball were hosting the breakfast show when Bannister left Radio 1 in 1998 (Ball would subsequently host the show on her own).

In the autumn of 1996 Bannister was appointed director of radio, a post which gave him responsibility for all the national BBC radio networks other than Five Live. He remained controller of Radio 1 alongside this until March 1998, when he was succeeded by Andy Parfitt. In 1999, Bannister was appointed chief executive of BBC Production, responsible for all non-news programme-making on English television, radio and online. He oversaw production centres in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. When John Birt announced he was stepping down as BBC director general, Bannister lost out to Greg Dyke. After a short stint in 2000 as director of marketing and communications, he returned to radio presenting on BBC 5 Live, Radio 4 and the World Service.

==Return to broadcasting==
In October 2000 Bannister resigned from the BBC to return to broadcasting. From 2003 to 2005 he had his own late night talk show on BBC Radio 5 Live. He also deputised for other presenters on the station as well as on programmes on Radio 4 such as &quot;Broadcasting House&quot; and &quot;Saturday PM&quot;. Since 2006 he has presented an obituary programme on Radio 4 called &quot;Last Word&quot; and between 2008 and 2018 also hosted &quot;Outlook&quot; on the BBC World Service. He has also sat in for Jeremy Vine on his lunchtime Radio 2 show. He was chairman of the independent production company &quot;Wire Free Productions&quot; from 2012 to 2018.

== &quot;Folk on Foot&quot; ==
In August 2018, Bannister launched his own podcast, &quot;Folk on Foot&quot;, in which he walks and talks with leading folk performers in the landscapes that have inspired them. During the Covid pandemic lockdowns, the podcast staged four online Front Room Festivals which raised £327,000 for musicians who had lost their livelihoods. In 2023, Bannister walked 186 miles in two weeks from the Wickham Festival in Hampshire to FolkEast in Suffolk, raising nearly £18,000 for the charity Help Musicians.

The podcast has won or been nominated for many awards:

== Honorary doctorates ==
On 20 July 2011 Bannister was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, the University of Nottingham. On 19 November 2019 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of arts from Sheffield Hallam University. On 19 July 2023 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Sheffield.

He is a Fellow of the Radio Academy and the Royal Society of Arts.

==Personal life==
Bannister married his first wife, the radio and TV presenter Amanda Walker, in 1984. Their daughter Jessica was born later the same year. In 1988 Amanda drowned while swimming in the sea off the Spanish Costa Blanca during a family holiday. In 1989, Bannister married Shelagh Macleod, who later became senior vice-president of legal and business affairs at the record company EMI. Their son Joe was born in 1990. Shelagh died of breast cancer in 2005. In 2007, he married Katherine Hood, a private equity investor. They were divorced in 2013. In 2023, he married his long-term partner, Kate Pluck.

<doc id="920668" wikidata="Q5923290" url="?curid=920668" title="Hqx (algorithm)">
<text>hqx (&quot;high quality scale&quot;) is a set of 3 image upscaling algorithms developed by Maxim Stepin. The algorithms are hq2x, hq3x, and hq4x, which magnify by a factor of 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It was initially created in 2003 for the Super NES emulator ZSNES, and is used in emulators such as Nestopia, F. CEUXSnes9x., and Snes9x.

==Algorithm==

The source image&#x27;s pixels are iterated through from top-left to bottom-right. For each pixel, the surrounding 8 pixels are compared to the color of the source pixel. Shapes are detected by checking for pixels of similar color according to a YUV threshold. hqx uses the YUV color space to calculate color differences, so that differences in brightness are weighted higher to order to mimic human perception. This gives a total of formula_1 combinations of similar or dissimilar neighbors. To expand the single pixel into a 2×2, 3×3, or 4×4 block of pixels, the arrangement of neighbors is looked up in a predefined table which contains the necessary interpolation patterns.

The interpolation data in the lookup tables are constrained by the requirement that continuity of line segments must be preserved, while optimizing for smoothness. Generating these 256-filter lookup tables is relatively slow, and is the major source of complexity in the algorithm: the render stage is very simple and fast, and designed to be capable of being performed in real time on a MMX-capable CPU.

In the source code, the interpolation data is represented as preprocessor macros to be inserted into switch case statements, and there is no source code leading to the generation of a lookup table. The author describes the process of generating a look-up table as:
... for each combination the most probable vector representation of the area has to be determined, with the idea of edges between the different colored areas of the image to be preserved, with the edge direction to be as close to a correct one as possible. That vector representation is then rasterised with higher (3x) resolution using anti-aliasing, and the result is stored in the lookup table.

==Implementations==

* The original algorithm has been ported to DevIL (but kept in the C language).
* Ports to Java and C# languages are available. These implementations expand the macros.
* A C++ port by byuu, the author of bsnes, which encodes the LUT in a space-efficient way. Byuu exploited the symmetry of patterns to make such an encoding, and wrote some notes on interpreting the original look up tables.
* libretro implements two families of shaders in Slang/HLSL, GLSL, and Cg:
** The hqx family, which is true hqx. As it runs on modern GPUs, lookup tables are substituted by textures. The textures were generated by interrogating a modified version of hqx for its switch/case.
** The scalehq family, which is frequently confused with hqx. It is not related to hqx, but is rather a generic upscaling-smoothing algorithm.
* hqx has also been implemented in ffmpeg for upscaling images and videos 2x, 3x, or 4x. An account of the production of the translation for ffmpeg is here and usage may be something like: codice_1 to produce a 2x image or video.

<doc id="920679" wikidata="Q1937367" url="?curid=920679" title="Minnesota State Fair">
<text>The Minnesota State Fair is the state fair of the U.S. state of Minnesota. Also known by its slogan, &quot;The Great Minnesota Get-Together&quot;, it is the largest state fair in the United States by average daily attendance and the second-largest state fair in the United States by total attendance, trailing only the State Fair of Texas, which generally runs twice as long as the Minnesota State Fair. The state fairgrounds, adjacent the Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota, are in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, midway between the state&#x27;s capital city of Saint Paul and the adjacent city of Roseville, near the Como Park and Saint Anthony Park neighborhoods of Saint Paul. Residents of the state and region come to the fair to be entertained, exhibit their best livestock, show off their abilities in a variety of fields including art and cooking, learn about new products and services, and eat many different types of food—often on a stick. The Minnesota State Fair was named the best state fair in the United States in 2015 by readers of &quot;USA Today&quot;.

The fair runs for twelve days from late August into early September, ending on Labor Day. Around two million people attend the fair annually. Attendance in 2019 was a record 2,126,551 people. The highest daily attendance in the history of the fair was 270,426 visitors on Saturday, September 1, 2018.

==History==

Minnesota Territory first held a Territorial Fair in 1854, although the first Minnesota State Fair didn&#x27;t occur until 1859, the year after statehood. 
In its early years during the 19th century, the fair was held in many different locations. Some were not far from the current site, but others were held in Greater Minnesota, including years where it was held in Rochester, Owatonna, and Winona. For a time in the 1870s, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul held competing fairs. Minneapolis, the younger city of the pair, eventually outdid its neighbor by staging the larger fair with the help of William S. King.
In 1884, a committee was put together by the Minnesota State Agricultural Society to select a permanent site. One site that was considered was an area around Minnehaha Falls, but the final site chosen was the Ramsey County Poor Farm, the fair&#x27;s current site. It was a politically neutral site, being about halfway between Minneapolis and St. Paul. The fair first opened its doors there on September 7, 1885. The site was then , but now stands at . The fair ran six days from 1885 to 1918. It was eight days from 1919 to 1938, ten days from 1939 to 1971 and 11 days from 1972 to 1974. It has been 12-days long since 1975.

One of the first annual events to occur is the creation of a butter sculpture. Each year, a new Princess Kay of the Milky Way is selected to promote Minnesota&#x27;s dairy industry. Part of the job involves posing for several hours in a walk-in, glass-walled refrigerator as a block of butter is carved into a head with her likeness. Butter makers started sculpting their products at the fair as far back as 1898, although the head-sculpting tradition did not begin until 1964.

The main entrance to the fair from Snelling Avenue heads onto a road named Dan Patch Avenue for a pacer horse who won every race he ran in from 1900 to 1909 when he was retired.

In 1898 the Spanish American War broke out. The states were requested to provide volunteers and Minnesota quickly had enough to form four Regiments. They were initially numbered 1–4, but GAR veterans felt that they should continue the numbering from the Civil War and they became the 12th–15th Minnesota Infantry Regiments. All four were mustered and organized on the State Fair Grounds. Camp Ramsey on Machinery Hill was the encampment site.

One of the most significant dates in the fair&#x27;s history was September 2, 1901, when then-Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was visiting and first uttered the famous phrase, &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick.&quot; Roosevelt became president just 12 days later, after William McKinley was assassinated. In 1925, the Minnesota State Fair was the site of the Norse-American Centennial celebration. During his appearance at the Norse-American Centennial, President Calvin Coolidge gave recognition to the contributions of Scandinavian-Americans and noted Leif Erikson as the discoverer of America.

In 1967, attendance was well over a million people and the record day that year was about 197,000 visitors. By 2016, attendance neared 2 million and the record day was about a quarter-million people.
2018 was another record year for the Fair. The overall attendance record of 2,046,533 was set along with an all-time single-day attendance record of 270,426 on the second Saturday.


===Cancellations===
Since 1859, the fair has run annually except for six different years. In 1861 and 1862, the fair was not held because of the Civil War and the Dakota War of 1862. Scheduling issues between the fair and the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois caused the 1893 fair to be cancelled. The fair was not held in 1945, as fuel was in short supply due to World War II and it was again cancelled in 1946 because of an outbreak of polio.

The fair was most recently cancelled in 2020, this time due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the decision announced on May 22, 2020. Fair Manager Jerry Hammer had previously stated that the 2020 fair would not be a postponed or scaled-back event; it would either run unchanged or be cancelled. Of the decision to cancel, Hammer stated &quot;this is the time of year when things really need to take off, and we can&#x27;t do it. There&#x27;s not time.&quot; Instead, a food parade featuring several well-known State Fair vendors was held on several dates in October.

To make up for 2020&#x27;s cancellation, the fair management hosted its first-ever spring event entitled &quot;Kickoff To Summer&quot; featuring scaled-back concessions and attractions. It also served as a test to the fair&#x27;s eventual return in 2021. The &quot;Kickoff to Summer&quot; event returned in 2022 after positive reception in 2021.

==Attractions==

===Livestock===
A large portion of the Fairgrounds are occupied by livestock barns where various farm animals are displayed. The animals and their owners take part in livestock shows to compete for awards. Most of the shows take place in the Lee &amp; Rose Warner Coliseum, a large indoor arena on the fairgrounds. The Coliseum was constructed to replace the Hippodrome, which was rendered structurally unsound during its use as a Propeller Plant by the A.O. Smith Corporation during WWII and razed in 1946, and was completed for use in the 1951 fair. Open class livestock competitions are held in horses, beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, sheep, dairy goats, llamas, poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons) rabbits, and stock dogs. On August 31, 2007, a bull escaped from its handler charging several fairgoers before fatally injuring itself charging a fire hydrant. No people were seriously injured in the mishap.

===Food===
Foods served at the annual Minnesota State Fair have traditionally included watermelon pickles, baked beans, buffalo burgers, deep-fried cheese curds, cotton candy, glazed ham, Australian battered potatoes, chimichangas and homemade apple pie. Some foods reflect Minnesota&#x27;s agriculture, including cheese curds, milk shakes, and corn dogs.

Many foods at the fair are deep-fried or come on a stick, from the classic corn dog to alligator-on-a-stick, lobster-on-a-stick, and deep-fried candy bar on a stick. New to the fair in 2006 was hotdish on a stick, a variant of a classic staple of Minnesotan cuisine. In 2007, one new food was spaghetti on a stick. 2008&#x27;s new foods included two types of bacon, one called &quot;Pig Lickers&quot;, which is chocolate covered, and the other, called the &quot;Big Fat Bacon&quot;, which is of maple-glazed bacon. Another staple of the state fair is “Sweet Martha’s Cookies,” a stand that serves fresh and warm chocolate chip cookies in buckets.

In 2018, 27 new foods were introduced to the Minnesota State Fair including Firecracker Shrimp Stuffed Avocado, Honey Cream Soda Float, Mangonada Shaved Ice, Messy Giuseppe, Nordic Waffles, Smoked Soft Serve Ice Cream, and the UpNorth Puff Pastry. New foods for 2019 included fried tacos on a stick, stuffed cabbage rolls, feta bites, shrimp and grits fritters, blueberry key lime pie, Buffalo chicken chimichanga and assorted other dessert selections.

===Machinery Hill/The North End===
Machinery Hill is a large area of the fairgrounds. For several decades, it held the largest annual display of farm equipment in the world, with many companies showing off tractors, combines, and various attachments. However, modern displays generally focus on cars, trucks, lawn mowers, hot tubs and recreational machines like motorbikes. Farm implement dealers tend to direct their efforts to more targeted &quot;farm shows,&quot; abandoning the State Fair to more urban or suburban types of exhibitors. Machinery Hill also contains an interactive exhibit for kids called Little Farm Hands. In this exhibit, children get to experience life on the farm from planting seeds to selling goods at the farmers market.

Machinery Hill is gradually being rebranded as &quot;The North End.&quot; In 2019, a new main entrance gate was created in addition to the new North End Event Center, which hosts traveling events and expositions. Its 2019 inaugural event was ANGRY BIRDS UNIVERSE: THE EXHIBITION.

===Shows===
The State Fair hosts concerts, comedy shows, product demonstrations, the State Fair Talent Contest and other shows.

The Grandstand is a large outdoor concert venue that also features three floors of interior exhibition space. It hosts the largest of the fair&#x27;s concerts and until 2002 was also the site of stock car races run on a small oval track. In 2003 the facility completed the first phase of a $35 million remodeling project that removed large sections of bleachers and increased seating capacity to 17,000.

Most local television and radio stations set up temporary studios at the State Fair in their permanent buildings or booths.

In 2012 the fair began holding the Walker Art Center&#x27;s Internet Cat Video Festival in the grandstand. Fairgoers watch the year&#x27;s most popular cat videos and memes and award the best videos with cat trophies, the most prized being the Golden Kitty. Guest appearances have included Grumpy Cat and Lil Bub, two internet stars, as well as the creator of Nyan Cat, Christopher Torres.

===Art===

The fair displays an annual art exhibition that is the result of a juried competition of works of fine art. Media include watercolor, oil, and acrylic paintings, photographs, sculptures, pastels, ceramics, glass, and textiles. Entrants must be living residents of the state. In 2010, a total of 2,330 pieces were submitted, and 413 works were accepted.

One unusual display at the fair consists of the entrants in the crop art competition. The artwork must be made of plant matter (seeds, stems, flowers, fruit, etc.) suitable for growing in Minnesota. For decades the display was dominated by Owatonna native Lillian Colton (1912–2007), who created seed portraits, professionally, having effectively captured scores of celebrities such as Ernest Hemingway, Barbra Streisand, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prince, Princess Diana, and Willie Nelson in her crop art. After winning nine purple ribbons, she stopped competing, but continued displaying her work at the fair.
There are competitions in dozens of categories in needlecraft, garment-making, wood-working, models, painting, doll-making, taxidermy, stamp-collecting, scrapbooking, baking, canning, and others.

===Milk run===
The annual 5 km run begins on the fairgrounds, winds its way through the Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota and the Saint Anthony Park neighborhood, and ends back at the fairgrounds.

===4-H===
4-H has a significant presence at the fair, both in the 4-H Building and in the animal barns and arenas. Contests include herdsmanship, horse showmanship, judging teams, public presentations, county club exhibits, and the popular llama and alpaca costume contest. Livestock displays include beef and dairy cattle, dairy and market goats, poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and pigeons), rabbits, domestic sheep, and swine. About half of all 4-H projects entered are animal science projects. The 4-H building was opened and dedicated in 1939 and about 320,000 state fairgoers visit it every year. The non-livestock projects include photography, performing arts, crafts, food &amp; nutrition, and clothing &amp; textiles.

===Science===
In recent years the Progress Center has been housing the Eco Experience exhibit, which features activities and exhibits including the design and construction of an eco-friendly house, a rain garden, exhibits addressing climate change, energy conservation, renewable energy, biodiesel fuel and vehicles, and organic farming. The exhibit has received awards from the Western Fair Association, the International Associate of Fairs and Expositions, and the Minnesota Environmental Initiative.

===State Fair Carousel===
In 1913 Austin McFadden, a Michigan entrepreneur approached the Fair about building the first roller coaster on the Fair grounds and was turned down. The next year he was back and offered to throw in a merry-go-round to get the Fair Board&#x27;s approval. They did. For the price of $8,500 McFadden got 30 tons of wood and steel decorated with 68 hand carved horses, 2 chariots and an organ from the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The Carousel became a State Fair institution that all of Minnesota thought belonged to the fair grounds. It had no sign on it indicating its ownership was not public while being installed on public land. Without any disclosure in 1988 the Fair&#x27;s board refused to extend the Carousel&#x27;s lease. The public learned the owners had dismantled the Carousel and sent it to auction in New York. The price wanted was $1.1 million. The idea that the State Fair Carousel would be lost to Minnesota prompted a public effort to save it. While not at the Fair grounds, today it remains intact at Como Park close by. It is now named for the largest contributor to its remaining in Minnesota, Gerard Cafesjian.

==Entertainment==

===Music===
Musical venues include The Grandstand, with a capacity of up to 17,000, and free entertainment venues.

===Permanent rides===
There are several rides that are permanent fixtures at the fair, including the Giant Slide, on which fairgoers ride down a large fiberglass slide on burlap sacks. The Skyride is an aerial lift ride that carries fairgoers across the grounds in a gondola. The Space Tower is a gyro tower that rotates as it lifts people over 300 feet (90 m) in the air, giving views of the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. There is also a haunted house which has been around since 1977 and is located on Judson Ave. The fair&#x27;s oldest existing ride, Ye Old Mill (opened in 1915), is located near the food building. It is a &quot;tunnel of love&quot;-style ride for all ages.

===Temporary rides===
The Midway is a carnival-like setting that contains most of the rides at the State Fair. The attractions include several funhouses, roller coasters and other thrill rides as well as numerous games of skill. It is located across the street from the Midway, but is not a part of it. Kidway is the carnival area on the fairgrounds geared toward children. Kidway is located between Dan Patch and Wright Avenues on the north end of the fairgrounds.

==Management==
The Minnesota State Fair is a state government-related entity that is operated by the Minnesota State Agricultural Society. The management of the fair is handled by the board of managers. The state fair has not accepted governmental funds since 1949. Revenue from the fair is reinvested into maintenance and the next year&#x27;s fair.

The Minnesota State Fair Foundation is an organization that works to improve and preserves historic state fair buildings. The foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization, and also supports State Fair agricultural, scientific and educational programs. The foundation provided funding for the new Miracle of Birth center.

The Fair employs about 80 full-time staff members for the entire year; in the summer, some 400 seasonal staff are hired. During the fair time, around 3,000 temporary employees are hired.

===Police Department===
The State Fair area was policed by the Minnesota State Fair Police Department. The Chief of Police is Paul Paulos, appointed in 2018, who replaced Art Blakely, who had been chief for 37 years. Their authority is given by section 37.20 of the Minnesota Statutes. In 2020, 37 police officers were dismissed and required to re-apply for their positions, requiring a college degree which a number of longer-serving officers did not have, prompting a lawsuit against the State Fair on the grounds of age discrimination. Since 2021, the Ramsey County Sheriff&#x27;s Office patrols security at the fair.

==J. V. Bailey House==
The J. V. Bailey House, at 1263 Cosgrove Street, is one of the oldest buildings on the fairgrounds. It was built in 1911 and restoration was completed in 2006. It is connected to the greenhouses and was occupied year-round by the greenhouse superintendent until 2004. The State Fair Foundation operates out of the residence.

==Mascots==
The fair&#x27;s mascots are two anthropomorphized gophers. The choice of gopher as mascots was an homage to the University of Minnesota mascot which is also a gopher and was a historical reference to the expansion of railroads in Minnesota, towns popping up across the state like gophers. For these reasons, Minnesota is sometimes referred to as the gopher state. Fairchild, the original mascot, was suggested in a statewide contest by Gladys Anderson Brown in 1966 in honor of Henry S. Fairchild who advocated using the former Ramsey County Poor Farm as the permanent site of the fair. Dressed like an early barker on the midway with a straw hat and striped jacket, Fairchild has represented the fair since 1966. In 1986, he was joined on promotional materials by his nephew, Fairborne.

==Attendance records==
==Off-season use==
The fairgrounds host several events throughout the year. Events include horse shows in the Lee &amp; Rose Warner Coliseum and Horse Barn, the Minnesota Horse Expo and the Minnesota Beef Expo, gymnastics meets and other sporting events, dog shows, antique and hot-rod car shows, motorcycle shows, model railroad shows, clothing and jewelry shows, gun and weapon collectors shows, comic book conventions, flea markets and swap meets, and more. Buildings on the grounds are frequently rented for commercial events such as appliance sales, computer and electronics sales, and boat and car sales. Earlier in the summer, some of the fairground&#x27;s roads are used to host an annual series of bike races during the week, called the State Fair Affair Criterium Series. Many buildings on the fair grounds are rented for winter storage of boats, camping trailers, and similar equipment.

<text>The Defense Support Program (DSP) is a program of the United States Space Force that operated the reconnaissance satellites which form the principal component of the &quot;Satellite Early Warning System&quot; used by the United States.

DSP satellites, which are operated by the 460th Space Wing, detect missile or spacecraft launches and nuclear explosions using sensors that detect the infrared emissions from these intense sources of heat. During Desert Storm, for example, DSP was able to detect the launches of Iraqi Scud missiles and provide timely warnings to civilians and military forces in Israel and Saudi Arabia.

The satellites are in geosynchronous orbits, and are equipped with infrared sensors operating through a wide-angle Schmidt camera. The entire satellite spins so that the linear sensor array in the focal plane scans over the Earth six times every minute.

Typically, DSP satellites were launched on Titan IVB boosters with Inertial Upper Stages. However, one DSP satellite (DSP-16) was launched using the Space Shuttle Atlantis on mission STS-44 (24 November 1991).

The last known DSP satellite (flight 23) was launched in 2007 aboard the first operational flight of the Delta IV Heavy rocket, as the Titan IV had been retired in 2005. All 23 satellites were built by the prime contractor Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, formerly TRW, in Redondo Beach, California.

The 460th Space Wing, with headquarters at Buckley Space Force Base, Colorado, has units, primarily the 2nd Space Warning Squadron, that operate DSP satellites and report warning information, via communications links, to the NORAD and USSTRATCOM early warning centers within the Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station, Colorado. These centers immediately forward data to various agencies and areas of operations around the world.

The SBIRS Wing at the Space Systems Command, Los Angeles Space Force Base, California is responsible for development and acquisition of the satellites.

== History ==
The Defense Support Program replaced the 1960s space-based infrared Missile Defense Alarm System (MIDAS). The first successful launch of MIDAS (MIDAS-2) was 24 May 1960 and there were twelve launches before the DSP program replaced it in 1970.

Benefiting from funds released by the cancellation of Manned Orbiting Laboratory, the first launch of a DSP (IMEWS-1 - Integrated Missile Early Warning Satellite) was on 6 November 1970 and since then it has become the mainstay of the United States ballistic missile early warning system. For the last 45 years they have provided an uninterrupted space-based early warning capability. The original DSP satellite weighed 2,000 pounds (900 kg) and had 400 watts of power, 2000 detectors and a design life of 1.25 years.

Throughout the life of the program, the satellite design has undergone numerous improvements to enhance reliability and capability. The weight grew to 5,250 pounds (2380 kg), the power to 1275 watts, the number of detectors increased threefold to 6000 and the design life has been increased to a goal of ten years.

The numerous improvement projects have enabled DSP to provide accurate, reliable data in the face of evolving missile threats. On-station sensor reliability has provided uninterrupted service well past their design lifetime. Recent technological improvements in sensor design include above-the-horizon capability and improved resolution. Increased on-board signal-processing capability improves clutter rejection. Enhanced reliability and survivability improvements were also incorporated.

The 23rd, and last DSP satellite (DSP-23) was scheduled to be launched on 1 April 2007, aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket, but the launch was postponed until mid-August 2007 after two structural cracks were found in the metal launch table at pad 37B, caused by a fuel leak during testing. Further delays forced the launch back to 11 November 2007, when the satellite launched at 01:50:00 UTC (20:50 EST on 10 November). This satellite died in space sometime during 2008, for reasons unknown. It is now adrift in geosynchronous orbit and remains a potential hazard to other craft.

The Department of Defense sent a MiTEx spacecraft to inspect DSP 23 sometime in 2008.

Another DSP satellite was lost in 1999, DSP-19, after its Inertial Upper Stage failed following launch from a Titan 4B booster. DSP-19 was a USAF Defense Support Program missile early warning satellite equipped with an infrared telescope to detect rocket launches. The Titan 4B rocket placed the IUS upper stages and payload into a 188 km x 718 km x 28.6° parking orbit. The first stage on the IUS burned at 18:14 GMT and put the second stage and payload into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. The IUS second stage fired at 23:34 GMT. However, the two stages of the IUS failed to separate completely. At least one connector remained attached. This meant the second stage motor nozzle did not extend properly. When the stage fired, the vehicle tumbled during the burn and the satellite was left out of control in a useless orbit.

The project was originally to have had 25 satellites, but the last two have been canceled, mainly due to SBIRS. DSP satellites have been replaced by the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites.

There were five major improvement programs on the 23 satellites:

* Block 1: Phase I, 1970–1975, five satellites
* Block 2: Phase II, 1976–1987, seven satellites
* Block 3: Multi-Orbit Satellite Performance Improvement Modification (MOS/PIM), 1989–1991, three satellites
* Block 4: Phase II Upgrade, 1994–1997, two satellites
* Block 5: DSP-I (DSP-Improved), 1999–2007, six satellites

More recently, there has been some effort put into using DSPs&#x27; infrared sensors as part of an early warning system for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and forest fires.

The movie &quot;War Games&quot; (1983) mentions a possible &quot;DSP malfunction.&quot;

== Limitations ==
The DSP constellation may have offered an excellent vantage point for an early warning system against state-centric threats such as missiles, but military analysts warn its ability to collect intelligence on non-state actors is severely limited.

<text>Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, A Young Man and Life&#x27;s Greatest Lesson is a 1997 memoir by American author Mitch Albom. The book is about a series of visits Albom made to his former Brandeis University sociology professor, Morrie Schwartz, as Schwartz was dying from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Albom&#x27;s subsequent memoir has been widely reviewed and has received critical attention after features by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; about Schwartz&#x27;s dying.

The book spent 206 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Non-Fiction Bestsellers List and remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for several years; as of 2006, it was the best-selling memoir of all time.

==Synopsis==
Author Mitch Albom is a successful sports columnist. In 1995, Albom contacts his former sociology professor, Morrie Schwartz, after seeing him on &quot;Nightline&quot; afflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Albom is prompted to visit Schwartz in Massachusetts, where a coincidental newspaper strike allows him to visit every Tuesday. The book is divided into 14 days, each containing one of Albom&#x27;s visits to Schwartz. Each visit includes lectures from Morrie on life experiences with flashbacks and references to contemporary events. Schwartz&#x27;s final days, ultimately, are spent giving Albom his final lesson of life.

==Main characters==
===Mitch Albom===

Mitch Albom was born in May 1958 in New Jersey. Originally, he was a pianist and wanted to pursue a life as a musician. Instead, Albom became a journalist and later an author, screenwriter, and television/radio broadcaster In college, he met sociology professor Dr. Morrie Schwartz, who would later be the focal point of the memoir &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;.

===Morrie Schwartz===

Morrie Schwartz was a sociology professor at Brandeis University who was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, at the age of 77 in August 1994. The son of Russian immigrants, Schwartz had a difficult childhood, indelibly marked by the death of his mother and his brother&#x27;s infection with the polio virus. He later went on to work as a researcher in a mental hospital, where he learned about mental illness and how to have empathy and compassion for other people; later in life, he decided to become a sociology professor in hopes of putting his accumulated wisdom to use. This is where Schwartz met his student Mitch Albom, who would later become a lifelong friend. Schwartz was married to Charlotte Schwartz, with whom he had two children. After a long battle with ALS, Schwartz died on November 4, 1995. His tombstone reads, &quot;A teacher until the end.&quot;

== &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; antecedents ==
In March 1995, Jack Thomas of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote a piece on Schwartz, titled &quot;A Professor&#x27;s Final Course: His Own Death.&quot; Ted Koppel became aware of the article, and a decision was made to conduct a series of interviews with Schwartz, which began later in March and which were then edited and presented on &quot;Nightline&quot;. It was through this program&#x27;s airing that Schwartz&#x27;s former student, Albom, was reminded of his old professor, leading Albom to reach out and reconnect.

==Reception==

===Popular===
&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; spent 206 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Non-Fiction Bestsellers List and remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for several years. In July 2006, &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; was the best selling memoir of all time.

===Critical===

Albom&#x27;s book has been widely reviewed since its appearance in 1997.

==Publication history==

* Hardcover. The ISBN-13 for this version is stated as 9780385484510. Note, not all Wikipedia Inbox information is confirmed by these sources.

===Other editions===
An unabridged audiobook was also published and narrated by Albom. The appendix of the audiobook contains several minutes of excerpts from audio recordings that Albom made during his conversations with Schwartz before writing the book. A new edition with an afterword by Albom was released on the book&#x27;s twentieth anniversary in 2017.

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted into a 1999 television film directed by Mick Jackson, starring Jack Lemmon. as Schwartz and Hank Azaria as Albom.

The book&#x27;s author, Mitch Albom, and esteemed playwright Jeffrey Hatcher joined forces for a stage play adaptation that premiered Off-Broadway in November 2002 at the Minetta Lane Theatre. Directed by David Esbjornson, it starred Alvin Epstein as Schwartz and Jon Tenney as Albom. A revival of the play, featuring Len Cariou as Schwartz and Chris Domig as Albom, was presented by the Sea Dog Theater company at St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church in the spring of 2024.

<text>The Inhul () is a left tributary of the Southern Bug (Boh) and is the 14th longest river of Ukraine. It flows through the Kirovohrad and Mykolaiv regions.

It starts near the village of Rodnykivka, Oleksandriia Raion in Kirovohrad Oblast (Central Ukraine), flowing south towards the Southern Bug at Mykolaiv, which is north (up river) from where the Southern Bug empties into the Black Sea. The Inhul River is long.

The river valley is mostly trapezium-like with a width of up to 4 km and a depth of up to 60 meters. At the upper stream it has a narrow winding channel that cuts through the Dnieper Upland, and its rocky banks show granite and gneiss; at the middle and lower stream after entering the Black Sea Lowland, it widens up to 30 meters and over. The river freezes over in December and thaws sometime in March.

Among major cities on the river are Kropyvnytskyi and Mykolaiv.

<text>The Tadjourah Region , ) is a region in north-central Djibouti, the largest of its six regions. With its capital at Tadjourah, it has an area of . It lies along the Gulf of Tadjoura, and the coastal city of Tadjoura. The region has active salt and fisheries industries, and is served by the Tadjoura Airport. In total area, it is larger than Brunei and smaller than Cyprus.

==History==
The boundaries of the present-day Djibouti nation state were established during the Scramble for Africa. The first French establishment in the Horn of Africa, and in 1884 they sign a treaty with the Afar. The poet Arthur Rimbaud became a trader, and lived in Tadjoura from 1885 to 1886. He was the owner of a particular ship carrying weapons to be sold to the King of Shoa, cousin of the father of future Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie. In 1883 the French Somaliland () was officially founded.

==Overview==

The region is the largest of the country&#x27;s &#x27;six&#x27; (one of which is sometimes termed a city instead of a region, the country&#x27;s eponymous capital with the bulk of the country&#x27;s population, Djibouti City). A mixture of semi-desert mountains and desert, the region is 35.5 times larger than the capital&#x27;s area and has a population nine times smaller. The region is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Ethiopia to the northwest, the Obock Region to the northeast, the Dikhil and Arta regions and Lake Asal to the south, and the Gulf of Tadjourah to the southeast.

The capital of the Tadjourah Region is Tadjourah city. Mousa Ali, the highest point in Djibouti is in the northern part. Tadjourah City is one of two ports in the northern part of the country. Administrative and customary center Tadjourah is also an important trading center. The small city also plays an important role in the political stability of Djibouti. The main towns are: Sagallou, Dorra Bankoualé, Randa, Adailou, Garbannab, Guirori, Kalaf, Assa-Gueyla, Balho, Bouyya, Mouddo, The Day and Ambado. Besides its deep religious tradition with its seven mosques it has far-reaching panoramas.

Due to its many whitewashed buildings and structures, Tadjourah is known as the &quot;White City&quot;. Most people in the wider region are involved in marine commerce, including a large number of fishermen. The region has sandy beaches, tourism and trade. It exports salts from deposits around Lake Assal, one of the country&#x27;s main natural resources. Tadjourah will soon have a modern port, complementary to that of Djibouti City and the fisheries industry is growing. The western half of it is steep valleys and high escarpments. Almost 65% of its area can be considered agricultural to the extent of seasonal grazing in many years and a minority of land in the wettest areas such as the south-western highlands near Randa near the south support year-round grazing and subsistence crop agriculture for a few months of the year, being mild and semi-arid. For air transportation, the Tadjourah Region is served by the Tadjoura Airport.

According to the 2009 Census, the local population consists of 89,567 individuals, 48,402 of whom are nomads.

===Day Forest===
The region has the roughly circular Day Forest National Park in many, often precipitous valleys of the Goda Mountains which is set back from the coastal RN9 route from Tadjourah City to the west. This it the main road of the region, providing a circuitous, up and down route to the capital city compared to the sea route which is approximately a fifth of the distance. It also provides the only proper road of the region into Ethiopia. This is the largest forest in the country, a semi-arid surrounded by semi-desert, with four dominant species: &quot;Juniperus procera&quot;, &quot;Olea africana&quot;, &quot;Buxus hildebrandtii&quot;, and &quot;Tarchonanthus camphoratus&quot;.

==Climate==
Elevations play a major factor in temperature, with the escarpments and plateaus on average cooler, day or night. The climate of the coastal strip is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the closest parts free from extremes highs and providing occasional rainfall. The overnight lows in the highlands - the western half of the region - drop to about .

The annual mean statistics for some Tadjoura Region centres is shown below:

<text>Benjamin Bourne (September 9, 1755September 17, 1808) was a United States representative from Rhode Island, a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island and a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Circuit Court for the First Circuit.

==Education and career==

Born on September 9, 1755, in Bristol in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Bourne was the son of Shearjashub Bourn, a lawyer who eventually served on the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
Like his father, Bourne graduated from Harvard University in 1775, received a Master of Arts degree from the same institution in 1778, and read law. He was quartermaster of the Second Rhode Island Regiment in 1776. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Providence, Rhode Island. He was a deputy in the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1780 and from 1787 to 1790. He was clerk of the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1780 to 1786. He was a Justice of the Peace in Providence from 1785 to 1790.

==Congressional service==

Upon the ratification of the United States Constitution by the State of Rhode Island, Bourne was elected as a Pro-Administration candidate from Rhode Island&#x27;s at-large congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 1st through the 3rd United States Congresses and as a Federalist to the 4th and 5th United States Congresses and served from August 31, 1790, until his resignation on October 13, 1796, before the close of the 4th United States Congress.

==Federal judicial service==

Bourne received a recess appointment from President George Washington on October 13, 1796, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island vacated by Judge Henry Marchant. He was nominated to the same position by President Washington on December 21, 1796. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 22, 1796, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on February 20, 1801, due to his elevation to the First Circuit.

Bourne was nominated by President John Adams on February 18, 1801, to the United States Circuit Court for the First Circuit, to a new seat authorized by . He was confirmed by the Senate on February 20, 1801, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on July 1, 1802, due to abolition of the court.

==Later service and death==

Following his departure from the federal bench, Bourne resumed private practice in Providence and Bristol from 1801 to 1808. He died on September 17, 1808, in Bristol. He was interred in Juniper Hill Cemetery in Bristol.

==Family==

Bourne was a first cousin once removed of Massachusetts United States Representative Shearjashub Bourne.

<doc id="920702" wikidata="Q218013" url="?curid=920702" title="Binary file">
<text>A binary file is a computer file that is not a text file. The term &quot;binary file&quot; is often used as a term meaning &quot;non-text file&quot;. Many binary file formats contain parts that can be interpreted as text; for example, some computer document files containing formatted text, such as older Microsoft Word document files, contain the text of the document but also contain formatting information in binary form.

== Structure ==
Binary files are usually thought of as being a sequence of bytes, which means the binary digits (bits) are grouped in eights. Binary files typically contain bytes that are intended to be interpreted as something other than text characters. Compiled computer programs are typical examples; indeed, compiled applications are sometimes referred to, particularly by programmers, as binaries. But binary files can also mean that they contain images, sounds, compressed versions of other files, etc. – in short, any type of file content whatsoever.

Some binary files contain headers, blocks of metadata used by a computer program to interpret the data in the file. The header often contains a signature or &quot;magic&quot; number which can identify the format. For example, a GIF file can contain multiple images, and headers are used to identify and describe each block of image data. The leading bytes of the header would contain text like codice_1 or codice_2 that can identify the binary as a GIF file. If a binary file does not contain any headers, it may be called a flat binary file.

A text file may consist partly or entirely of encoded binary information. When sending binary files over the network they may be encoded so that they use only printable characters. This is often necessary due to the limitations of network protocols used for internet browsing and e-mail communication. One such encoding is Base64. Also, files containing public-key and private-key information for use in systems employing asymmetric cryptography (such as website certificates) may also be stored with the binary information encoded in printable characters.

== Manipulation ==

To send binary files through certain systems (such as email) that do not allow all data values, they are often translated into a plain text representation (using, for example, Base64). Encoding the data has the disadvantage of increasing the file size during the transfer (for example, using Base64 will increase the file&#x27;s size by approximately 30%), as well as requiring translation back into binary after receipt. The increased size may be countered by lower-level link compression, as the resulting text data will have about as much less entropy as it has increased size, so the actual data transferred in this scenario would likely be very close to the size of the original binary data. See Binary-to-text encoding for more on this subject.

Microsoft Windows and its standard libraries for the C and C++ programming languages allow the programmer to specify a parameter indicating if a file is expected to be plain text or binary when opening a file; this affects the standard library calls to read and write from the file in that the system converts between the C/C++ &quot;end of line&quot; character (the ASCII linefeed character) and the end-of-line sequence Windows expects in files (the ASCII carriage return and linefeed characters in sequence). In Unix-like systems, the C and C++ standard libraries on those systems also allow the programmer to specify whether a file is expected to be text or binary, but the libraries can and do ignore that parameter, as the end-of-line sequence in Unix-like systems is just the C/C++ end-of-line character.

== Viewing ==

A hex editor or viewer may be used to view file data as a sequence of hexadecimal (or decimal, binary or ASCII character) values for corresponding bytes of a binary file.

If a binary file is opened in a text editor, each group of eight bits will typically be translated as a single character, and the user will see a (probably unintelligible) display of textual characters. If the file is opened in some other application, that application will have its own use for each byte: maybe the application will treat each byte as a number and output a stream of numbers between 0 and 255—or maybe interpret the numbers in the bytes as colors and display the corresponding picture. Other type of viewers (called &#x27;word extractors&#x27;) simply replace the unprintable characters with spaces revealing only the human-readable text. This type of view is useful for a quick inspection of a binary file in order to find passwords in games, find hidden text in non-text files and recover corrupted documents. It can even be used to inspect suspicious files (software) for unwanted effects. For example, the user would see any URL/email to which the suspected software may attempt to connect in order to upload unapproved data (to steal). If the file is itself treated as an executable and run, then the operating system will attempt to interpret the file as a series of instructions in its machine language.

== Interpretation ==

Standards are very important to binary files. For example, a binary file interpreted by the ASCII character set will result in text being displayed. A custom application can interpret the file differently: a byte may be a sound, or a pixel, or even an entire word. Binary itself is meaningless, until such time as an executed algorithm defines what should be done with each bit, byte, word or block. Thus, just examining the binary and attempting to match it against known formats can lead to the wrong conclusion as to what it actually represents. This fact can be used in steganography, where an algorithm interprets a binary data file differently to reveal hidden content. Without the algorithm, it is impossible to tell that hidden content exists.

==Binary compatibility==
Two files that are binary compatible will have the same sequence of zeros and ones in the data portion of the file. The file header, however, may be different.

The term is used most commonly to state that data files produced by one application are exactly the same as data files produced by another application. For example, some software companies produce applications for Windows and the Macintosh that are binary compatible, which means that a file produced in a Windows environment is interchangeable with a file produced on a Macintosh. This avoids many of the conversion problems caused by importing and exporting data.

One possible binary compatibility issue between different computers is the endianness of the computer. Some computers store the bytes in a file in a different order.

<text>MacBinary is a file format that combines the data fork and the resource fork of a classic Mac OS file into a single file, along with HFS&#x27;s extended metadata. The resulting file is suitable for transmission over FTP, the World Wide Web, and electronic mail. The documents can also be stored on computers that run operating systems with no HFS support, such as Unix or Windows.

MacBinary was widely supported on the Macintosh and was built into most communications programs on that platform. Similar solutions were built into most data compression applications on the Mac, and although these did not require MacBinary to survive transmission across non-Mac systems, MacBinary was often added in these cases to preserve longer filenames and other features.

The dual-fork nature of the HFS system was not used on Mac OS X, and MacBinary has largely disappeared.

==Description==
In contrast to other computers of the era, Macintosh applications included both computer code as well as a large number of &quot;resources&quot; that were used by the operating system (OS) itself. These resources were also widely used in documents to store rich media like sounds and images. However, the resource system had the significant limitation that the maximum size of any single resource was only 32 kB, far too small for storing document data. To address this, Apple introduced the concept of &quot;forks&quot;, allowing any file in the filesystem to have both a resource fork and a data fork. Physically these were separate files, but the OS would ensure the two separate files were always treated as a single object, so dragging it to a floppy disk in the Finder would copy both forks.

This presented a serious problem when the file had to be stored on other computer systems. Those systems, unaware of the fork concept, would have to store the two forks as separate files. This presented the possibility that the two would be separated at some point, or not properly recombined when they were transmitted back to the Mac. This problem led to a number of solutions that combined the two forks together into a single file, and then automatically pulling them back apart when they reached another Mac. MacBinary was one of the most popular solutions, although BinHex was also used on UseNet, where data transfer was not 8-bit clean. Apple&#x27;s own solutions, AppleSingle and AppleDouble, were never widely adopted in the user community.

Files encoded with MacBinary, regardless of the version, usually have a .bin or .macbin file extension appended to the ends of their filenames. E-mail programs such as Eudora can extract and decode MacBinary mail messages. Most dedicated FTP programs for the Mac, such as Fetch and Transmit, transparently decode MacBinary files they download.

MacBinary is similar to BinHex, but MacBinary produces binary files as opposed to ASCII text. Thus, MacBinary files are smaller than BinHex files, but older applications and servers are more likely to corrupt them.

==History==
The first incarnation of MacBinary was released in 1985. The standard was originally specified by Dennis Brothers (author of the terminal program MacTEP and later an Apple employee), BinHex author Yves Lempereur, PackIt author Harry Chesley, et al. then added support for MacBinary into BinHex 5.0, using MacBinary to combine the forks instead of his own methods. Most terminal programs and internet utilities added built-in MacBinary support during this period as well.

Two years later it was updated to MacBinary II, to accommodate changes in Mac OS. MacBinary II remained compatible with subsequent updates of the operating system for some time. This changed with the release of Mac OS 8, which necessitated the release of MacBinary III in 1996. In the meantime, Apple itself had released the AppleSingle and AppleDouble formats, which serve the same purpose as MacBinary, but correct some problems with it.

<text>The Obock Region (, , ) is a region in northern Djibouti. It has a land area of 4,700 square kilometres (1,800 sq mi), and had a population of 37,856 in 2009. It lies along the Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Tadjoura and includes the Seven Brothers, Doumeira Islands and the coastal city of Obock. It lies along a portion of the national border with Eritrea. In total area, it is larger than Cape Verde and smaller than Trinidad and Tobago. The topography of the region has highland and coastal plains.

==History==
In the mid-19th century and earlier, Obock was ruled by Afar sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1862 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region. The March 11, 1862 agreement the Afar sultan, Raieta Dini Ahmet signed in Paris was a treaty where the Afars sold the territory of Obock for 10,000 thalaris, around 55,000 francs and the Obock Territory was established. The French developed Obock as a colonial port, while the Italians maintained a port to the north of Obock at Assab.

Obock region became a separate administrative entity in 1927, with Michel Azenor appointed as chief.

==Geography==
The region covers an area of . It is bordered by Eritrea to the north, the Tadjourah Region to the southwest, and the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to the east. There are several salt-lakes on the road to Tadjoura.

The regional capital is Obock which is positioned on the Gulf of Tadjoura littoral, by the sea, by a group of beaches and flattened abraded in coral beds with a very salty sheet of water. The wooded area of the Mabla Mountains, reaching more than 1,000 m and housing the second forest of the country, constitutes the natural border between the region of Obock and that of Tadjourah. The coastline is more than a thousand kilometers long. Obock with its proximity to Yemen (less than two hours). The city has a functional airstrip and offers regular ferry services to Djibouti City. The wildlife such as hamadryas baboons, Soemmerring&#x27;s gazelle, dorcas gazelle, warthog, black-backed jackal, Ruppells sandfox, dikdik, African golden wolf, hyena, Abyssinian hare, wild ass and ostriches are found in this region. African wild dog was also found in this region, but their present condition is unknown. There have been reports of cheetah occurring in this region, but there has been no evidence of their presence.

==Economy==
The region is characterized mainly by an activity oriented towards animal production (goat and dromedary farming), and agricultural activities in irrigated areas and artisanal fishing along the entire length of its coastline. The practice of small business and other informal activities is also widespread in the town of Obock and in the main localities. The number of salaried jobs is quite limited. The 200 fishermen of Obock are relatively well organized as part of their Association of Fishermen Cooperatives of Obock.
==Climate==
The region is characterized by two seasons. The cool season, which runs from November to April, and the warm season which begins in May and is often more or less dry. The rare and low rainfall and endemic drought make this area one of the driest places in the country. The effects of climate change are also being felt. Sometimes it is hot and dry and sooner or later than usual. Sometimes it makes cool and wet longer or shorter, later or earlier than expected.

The annual mean statistics for some Tadjoura Region centres is shown below:

<text>The River Ise is a river in Northamptonshire, England and a tributary of the River Nene.

The river rises in a field that was part of the site of the Battle of Naseby in north-western Northamptonshire. The parish of Naseby lies across a watershed from which streams also flow to the rivers Avon and Nene. It flows east past Desborough and the Eleanor cross at Geddington, then through the grounds of Rushton Hall, before turning south and passing through the parkland of Boughton House where it was extensively canalised and landscaped in the late 17th century. It then flows between Kettering and Barton Seagrave where its valley was excavated during the creation of Wicksteed Park to provide a large lake for public amenity use. It finishes its journey by flowing past Burton Latimer and Finedon, joining the Nene just south of Wellingborough.

The Ise contains many varieties of coarse and game fish, including roach, perch, barbel, rudd, common dace and chub. It is also the only watercourse within Northamptonshire to contain grayling (&quot;Thymallus thymallus&quot;).

==Tributaries==

The River Ise has various named and unnamed tributaries that join it along its course.

===Slade Brook===

The Slade Brook sub-catchment is the largest tributary of the Ise and drains much of the urban area of Kettering, as well as smaller settlements west of the town including Rothwell and Broughton. Two reservoirs were constructed in this system at Cransley and Thorpe Malsor in the 1880s to provide water for local furnaces. Today these artificial lakes are used for recreational fishing and sailing. The Slade Brook joins the Ise just to the south of Wicksteed Park.

===Swanspool Brook===
The Swanspool Brook rises in woodland to the west of Hardwick and flows through Mears Ashby and Wilby before entering the urban area of Wellingborough, where its shallow valley forms an extensive area of open green space, as well as Swanspool Lake. It meets the Ise close to the confluence with the River Nene.

==Status==
In 2019, the overall classification of the River Ise under the Water Framework Directive was &#x27;Moderate&#x27; for the upper Ise, and &#x27;Poor&#x27; for the lower Ise. In both the upper and lower Ise, the predominant factor preventing the rivers from achieving &quot;Good&quot; status under the framework is high levels of phosphate, derived from poor nutrient and livestock management in the surrounding agricultural land and continuous discharge of treated sewage effluent.

<doc id="920715" wikidata="Q2637989" url="?curid=920715" title="Deck (building)">
<text>In architecture, a deck is a flat surface capable of supporting weight, similar to a floor, but typically constructed outdoors, often elevated from the ground, and usually connected to a building. The term is a generalization from the deck of a ship. A level architectural deck may be intended for use by people, e.g., what in the UK is usually called a decked patio. &quot;Roof deck&quot; refers to the flat layer of construction materials to which the weather impervious layers are attached to a form a roof, and they may be either level (for a &quot;flat&quot; rooftop) or sloped.

==Functions and materials==
Wood or timber decking can be used in a number of ways: as part of garden landscaping, to extend the living area of a house, and as an alternative to stone-based features such as patios. Decks are made from treated lumber, composite lumber, composite material, and aluminum. Lumber may be western red cedar, teak, mahogany, ipê, reclaimed and recycled ulin and other hardwoods. Recycled planks may be high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS) and PET plastic as well as mixed plastics and wood fiber (often called &quot;composite&quot; lumber). Artificial decking products are often called &quot;wood-plastic composites&quot; (WPC). WPCs have different brands like NewTechWood, Azek, Ecornboard etc.

Historically, the softwoods used for decking were logged from old growth forests. These include Atlantic white cedar, redwood, and western red cedar (redcedar). Atlantic City built the first coastal boardwalk in the United States, originally constructed of the Atlantic white cedar. Soon, the commercial logging of this tree and clearing of cedar swamps in New Jersey caused a decline in the availability of decking. Atlantic City and New York City both switched to Western red cedar. By the 1960s, western red cedar from the US was declining due to over-logging. More expensive western red cedar was available from western Canada (British Columbia) but by then, pressure-treated pine had become available.

But even with chemical treatments (such as chromated copper arsenate or CCA), pine decking is not as durable as cedars in an outdoor environment. Thus, many municipalities and homeowners are turning to hardwoods. Decks are often built from pressure-treated wood. Pressure-treated wood is long lasting and holds up to wet and icy conditions. Pressure-treating chemicals are known to be toxic. Both softwood and hardwood decks need to be finished after installation using either an oil or varnish to prevent weathering, wear, mould, algae and wood-boring insects.

Due to environmental and durability concerns, composite decking (a mixture of two materials, typically wood pulp and recycled material such as plastic bottles or plastic bags) have appeared on the market. Proponents of composite decking tout it as a much-needed development, as it helps to curb logging of trees for new decks. However, composite decking contains harmful chemicals, cannot be refurbished, and despite claims from decking companies, some composite decking still attracts mold. However, newer more modern composites feature a cap or shell that prevents mold and staining. In multi-story commercial construction, the dominant form of deck (including roof deck) construction is composite steel deck.

Generally, hardwoods used for decking come from tropical forests. Much of the logging of these woods, especially teak, mahogany and ipê, is illegal, as outlined in numerous reports by environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Rainforest Relief. US tropical wood imports are rising, partly due to the demand for decking.

==Construction==
The deck of a house is generally a wooden platform built above the ground and connected to the main building. It is generally enclosed by a railing for safety. Access may be from the house through doors and from the ground via a stairway. Residential decks can be constructed over steep areas or rough ground that is otherwise unusable. Decks can also be covered by a canopy or pergola to control sunlight. Deck designs can be found in numerous books, do-it-yourself magazines, and websites, and from the USDA.

Typical construction is either of a post and beam architecture, or a cantilever construction. The post-and-beam construction relies on posts anchored to piers in the ground. Typically, these types of structural decks are engineered and require an experienced construction company that specializes in structural decks. Cantilever decks rely on floor joists that protrude out further than the wall of the house. While this type of construction is common, it raises significant safety issues if the decks are not properly waterproofed and flashed. There have been a growing number of deck failures resulting in death and critical injuries. Another key component of decks are code compliant railings. Railings on decks above are considered guard rails. Guard rails have a specific building code requirement for both height and structural strength. Most U.S. commercial building codes require a guardrail on decks, and for a residential code depending on the state. Typical railing assemblies must meet structural strength requirements of . In short, decks are complex load-bearing structures that most often require structural engineering, plans, and permits.

Residential decks may contain spaces for cooking and seating. Cooking areas ideally should be situated near the patio door while out of the way from general foot traffic. Dining spaces will include patio tables. For a typical six-person outdoor patio table building, an area of is ideal. If deck space is available, homeowners may choose to include for the seating, outdoor couches and benches.

Larger buildings may also have decks on the upper floors of the building which can be open to the public as observation decks or greeneries. A deck is also the surface used to construct a boardwalk over sand on barrier islands.

Laying deck or throwing deck refers to the act of placing and bolting down cold-formed steel beneath roofing and concrete floors. This is usually done by an ironworker, sometimes in conjunction with a cement mason or carpenter. It regarded as one of the most physically demanding jobs in the iron working industry. In the United Kingdom the various bans on smoking in public buildings were expected to lead to an increase in the use of timber decking for outdoor spaces where smokers can gather.

== Deck Inspection and Safety ==
Regular inspections are essential to ensure the structural integrity and safety of decks, particularly those exposed to outdoor conditions. Many deck failures result from improper construction, lack of maintenance, or aging materials, leading to collapses that can cause serious injuries. Common issues identified during inspections include wood rot, corroded fasteners, weakened support posts, and improper flashing that leads to water damage.Building codes in various regions, such as California&#x27;s SB 721 and SB 326, mandate periodic deck inspections, balconies, and other elevated structures in multi-family residential buildings to prevent failures. Property owners and associations are often required to hire certified inspectors or structural engineers to assess load-bearing components and recommend repairs.Proper deck maintenance, including sealing wood surfaces, replacing damaged boards, and ensuring railings meet code requirements, is critical for extending the lifespan of the structure and reducing liability risks.

=== Urban rooftop decks ===

High-rise commercial and residential buildings with rooftop decks often utilize urban landscaping techniques to create &quot;green spaces&quot; or &quot;sky parks&quot;. With this trend in outdoor living increasing, many landscape architecture firms are specialized in the design, construction and maintenance of these spaces. Adjustable hybrid pedestal system allow for a self leveling, single model for all height applications, screw adjustable, and PVC pipe adjustable for elevated roof decks.

<doc id="920716" wikidata="Q5293105" url="?curid=920716" title="Don McGlashan">
<text>Don McGlashan (born 18 July 1959) is a New Zealand composer, singer and multi-instrumentalist who is best known for membership in the bands Blam Blam Blam, The Front Lawn, and The Mutton Birds, before going solo. He has also composed for cinema and television. 

McGlashan was also a member of Philip Dadson&#x27;s percussion group From Scratch, and bands The Bellbirds, The Plague, and composed pieces for New Zealand&#x27;s Limbs Dance Company. His first hits were with band Blam Blam Blam in the early 1980s. He later released four albums as lead singer and writer for The Mutton Birds.

He was a 2023 inductee to the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
McGlashan was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Both his parents were teachers: his father Bain taught civil engineering at Auckland Technical Institute and his mother Alice was a schoolteacher. McGlashan was actively encouraged to pursue music from a young age by his father, who bought him various musical instruments to learn on. McGlashan wrote &quot;Envy of Angels&quot; as a tribute to his father.
At age seven McGlashan began on cello and piano, &quot;then gradually added more instruments to that. [I] went through the tune-a-day for whatever instrument it was, for just about every instrument I think.&quot;

McGlashan attended Westlake Boys&#x27; High School, on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore. While at high school he began playing keyboard in local bands. &quot;I carried on sort of following those two strands – of learning how to write songs, learning how to be in a band, learning all the sort of extra musical stuff that you have to learn – and on the other side I was learning the French horn.&quot;

At the University of Auckland, McGlashan studied English and music, and played French horn and percussion in the Auckland Symphonia (later called the Auckland Philharmonia) from 1979 to 1982. McGlashan began working with Philip Dadson&#x27;s percussion group From Scratch in 1979, while playing in the Auckland Symphonia. McGlashan played a number of eclectic percussion instruments, such as the thongophone (PVC piping struck with jandals); the name of the group came from the fact that they produced their own instruments &#x27;from scratch&#x27;. On &quot;Standards&quot;, the album he jointly produced with Ivan Zagni for Propeller Records in 1982, he is credited as playing bass guitar, horn, whistle, percussion, marimba and vocals.

==Career==
===1981–1984: Blam Blam Blam===

In 1981, McGlashan replaced Ian Gilroy in punk band The Whizz Kids, who rechristened themselves Blam Blam Blam. McGlashan&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It Marsha, It&#x27;s Bigger Than Both of Us&quot; reached #17 in the New Zealand charts. Local music magazine &quot;Rip It Up&quot; deemed it &#x27;best single of the year&#x27;, and readers voted McGlashan drummer of the year.

===1985–1990: The Front Lawn===
In March 1985, a group formed for the purpose, Left, Right and Centre, released a single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, a protest against the proposed All Blacks tour of South Africa. The song was written by Don McGlashan, Frank Stark and Geoff Chapple. McGlashan, Chris Knox and Rick Bryant were the main vocalists.

McGlashan formed multi-media group The Front Lawn with Harry Sinclair. The duo (in their late stages a trio, thanks to the addition of actor Jennifer Ward-Lealand) won acclaim for theatre shows which combined music with physical comedy. McGlashan&#x27;s song &quot;Andy&quot;, written in memory of his late brother, was later listed among the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time.

McGlashan and Sinclair also made and starred in short films &quot;Walk Short&quot; (in which each played multiple roles), &quot;The Lounge Bar&quot; and 1990&#x27;s &quot;Linda&#x27;s Body&quot;. By now Sinclair was growing increasingly interested in directing, while McGlashan was keen to return to the live circuit. He had also begun composing for the screen.

===1991–2002: The Mutton Birds===

David Long moved from Wellington to Auckland to work with McGlashan, and the two began working together and auditioning drummers. After playing their first gig on St Patrick&#x27;s Day 1991 with a session drummer, Steve Garden, they heard about Ross Burge and convinced him to move back to New Zealand from New York to join The Mutton Birds. The band began to become successful—&quot;Anchor Me&quot; won McGlashan the 1994 Silver Scroll Award—and later moved to the UK. However, while the Mutton Birds received acclaim from UK critics and music magazines, they failed to achieve mainstream success. Eventually they disbanded, and McGlashan returned to New Zealand.

===2003–present: Solo work===
McGlashan&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Warm Hand&quot;, was released in May 2006. It was nominated for an NZ Music Award for album of the year, and debut single &quot;Miracle Sun&quot; was a nominee for New Zealand&#x27;s supreme songwriting award, the APRA Silver Scroll.

In March 2009, the album &quot;Marvellous Year&quot; was released through Arch Hill Records. The album is credited to Don McGlashan &amp; the Seven Sisters, a band which had begun when he toured &quot;Warm Hand&quot;. The album included a new version of McGlashan-penned hit &quot;Bathe in the River&quot;, with McGlashan on lead vocals.

In 2005, &quot;Anchor Me&quot; was re-recorded by an ensemble of NZ artists to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Rainbow Warrior bombing. 

In 2012 McGlashan was one of a select number of artists given permission to visit Antarctica. The following year he was awarded the two-month Michael King residency.

McGlashan played euphonium on album &quot;Time On Earth&quot;, by Crowded House. He played live with the band at Glastonbury 2008 and was a regular member of the touring line-up throughout their 2008 world tour. Later he played euphonium on track &#x27;Hole In My Head&#x27; by Melbourne singer/songwriter Marjorie Cardwell, for her 2012 album &quot;In Another World&quot;.

In 2012, McGlashan and Dave Dobbyn partnered for the Acoustic Church Tour.

In 2015 he released his third solo album &quot;Lucky Stars&quot;, which he described as &quot;his most personal album yet&quot;.

In 2022 he released his fourth solo album &quot;Bright November Morning&quot; which includes songs from his early days playing gigs with The Mutton Birds to his song about the 1881 invasion of Parihaka, titled John Bryce. McGlashan said it was hard to pinpoint where the album fits in his career.

&quot;It&#x27;d be like looking at a whole photo album of the last few years and saying this is exactly where I am, these are all the things that sort of make up who I am and who I am right now.&quot; Soon after its release the album reached the top of the New Zealand Record Album Music Charts

===Soundtrack work===
McGlashan began contributing to soundtracks as early as 1980, when he was one of the trio who composed the music for New Zealand police series &quot;Mortimer&#x27;s Patch&quot;. McGlashan composed occasionally for the screen over the next two and a half decades, including work on Jane Campion&#x27;s film &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot;; &quot;Cinema of Unease&quot;, a documentary about the history of New Zealand cinema; and long-running detective series &quot;Street Legal&quot;.

From 2005 onwards, McGlashan began to devote a lot more energy to soundtrack work. Since then he has composed the music for more than a dozen screen projects – predominantly feature films (including &quot;The Dead Lands&quot; and the orchestral soundtrack for &quot;Dean Spanley&quot;) – as well as short films (&quot;Tick&quot;) and television (Katherine Mansfield telemovie &quot;Bliss&quot;, TV series &quot;Orange Roughies&quot;).

The song &quot;Bathe In the River&quot; featured on McGlashan&#x27;s soundtrack to acclaimed Toa Fraser film &quot;No. 2&quot; (2006, also known as &quot;Naming Number Two&quot;). Sung by Hollie Smith, it reached number 2 on the New Zealand music charts and went platinum. The song also won him the 2006 APRA Silver Scroll Award, his second win.

In 2011 McGlashan provided the score to the fireworks during the opening ceremony of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

==Musical style==
McGlashan is noted for writing lyrics that feature New Zealand imagery and vernacular, many involving his hometown of Auckland. Examples include Dominion Road in Auckland (&quot;Dominion Road&quot;), the Auckland Harbour Bridge (&quot;Harbour Bridge&quot;), Takapuna Beach (&quot;Andy&quot;), and the Coromandel (&quot;Passenger 26&quot;). The Valiant in &quot;White Valiant&quot; was a commonly seen car in 1970s-era New Zealand: McGlashan never owned one, though fellow musician Dave Dobbyn did.

McGlashan is also known for writing about real-life events and people, including:
* The 1990 Aramoana massacre (&quot;A Thing Well Made&quot;)
* the 1993 Kader Toy Factory Fire in Thailand (&quot;Toy Factory Fire&quot;)
* Opo the dolphin (&quot;Miracle Sun&quot;)
* John Bryce and his invasion of Parihaka (&quot;John Bryce&quot;)
* Polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton (&quot;Shackleton&quot;)

McGlashan noted that while living in England as a member of the Mutton Birds, he still wrote &quot;letters to home&quot; to New Zealand in his songs, as he struggled to find a connection with English imagery.

In 1998 McGlashan explained his writing process as &quot;trying to write about people that I know. I suppose I &#x27;write letters&#x27; to people, or try to unpick a moment that I’ve lived through and either tell the story in the first person or make up some characters who then tell the story in their own words – and by using what they don’t say as much as what they do say, try and paint their world in a song.&quot;

He has also played a number of different instruments throughout his musical career: asked what instruments he plays, he answered, &quot;Well I don&#x27;t play violin&quot;. However, he is noted for playing the euphonium and French horn. With Blam Blam Blam, McGlashan played drums and euphonium. He later picked up guitar duties for his work with The Front Lawn and The Mutton Birds.

===Silver Scrolls===
McGlashan has won the APRA Silver Scroll twice. In 2006, McGlashan had two songs nominated for this award – a feat last achieved by Dave Dobbyn in 1995. &quot;Bathe in the River&quot;, written by McGlashan for the film &quot;No. 2&quot;, later won the award.


In 2001, a vote by members of APRA to find New Zealand&#x27;s Top 100 songs (what would eventually become the &quot;Nature&#x27;s Best&quot; series) included 5 McGlashan songs. These were:

* 23: The Mutton Birds – &quot;Dominion Road&quot;
* 49: The Mutton Birds – &quot;Anchor Me&quot; 
* 66: Blam Blam Blam – &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It Marsha, It&#x27;s Bigger Than Both of Us&quot; 
* 69: Blam Blam Blam – &quot;There Is No Depression in New Zealand&quot;
* 82: The Front Lawn – &quot;Andy&quot; (co-written with Harry Sinclair)

In October 2023, McGlashan was inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame.

===Other awards===

* 2001 – University of Auckland Literary Fellowship.
* 2002 – Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate Award.
* 2003 – New Zealand Television Awards, Best Original Music for &quot;Street Legal&quot;.
* 2007 – Auckland City Council Living Legend Award.
* 2012 – University of Auckland Distinguished Alumni Award.
* 2012 – Antarctica New Zealand&#x27;s Writers and Artists residency programme.
* 2013 – Michael King Writer&#x27;s Centre Writer in Residence.

==Personal life==
McGlashan married dancer and writer Marianne Schultz in 1989. The couple separated in 2012, and divorced in 2017. They have two children, Louie and Moe. McGlashan married Ann McDonell in 2018.

In 2008 McGlashan was angered that TVNZ had used a song performed by the Mutton Birds (&quot;Anchor Me&quot;) when the election results showed that the National Party had won the New Zealand elections.
McGlashan stated that he &quot;would rather have sex with a very ugly crayfish&quot; than let the National Party use his music. The song had been used by TVNZ in terms of the Australasian Performing Right Association&#x27;s blanket licence with TVNZ.

On 28 March 2011 McGlashan suffered three broken ribs, a punctured lung, and a broken collarbone after he hit a car door while cycling down Dominion Road, Auckland. He was hospitalised.

<text>Edsbyn () is a locality and the seat of Ovanåker Municipality, Gävleborg County, Sweden with 4321 inhabitants in 2020. It is located in the historical province of Hälsingland.

Edsbyn is most famous for its former ski and nowadays office furniture manufacturing industry Edsbyverken; the sports club Edsbyns IF; and being the hometown of the creator of Minecraft, Markus Persson throughout his early childhood.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Edsbyn, along with Alfta and other settlements in the area, used to have rail service along the Bollnäs–Orsa Railway. It was completed in January 1900 as a means of transporting forestry products from the area, with passenger service following, operated by SJ. During the 1960s, an improved road network took over large amounts of both passenger and cargo traffic that used to be carried by rail. This led to a reduction in, and later the suspension of passenger service on 1 September 1971. Limited freight service continued until 2004. Maintenance on the line ceased on 13 December 2015. 

Inlandsbanan have expressed interest in reopening the line for freight, more specifically lumber and limestone. A cost estimate conducted in 2011 put the cost at least at 60 million SEK. Politicians in the municipalities of Ovanåker, Bollnäs Rättvik, Orsa and Mora have also expressed interest in the line reopening.

The closest railway station in use is located in Bollnäs.

=== Road ===
Today, almost all traffic to Edsbyn occurs via road. Länsväg 301 provides the main connection to nearby towns such as Alfta, Bollnäs and Rättvik.
=== Public transport ===
Edsbyn is served by three bus lines, 100, 39 and 172, which are all operated by Xtrafik, the public transport provider in Gävleborg County.
=== Airport === 
Next to Edsbyn Arena, there is a small airfield with a 700-meter grass runway. The closest airport with regular service is &quot;Mora–Siljan Airport&quot;, located about southwest of Edsbyn.
==Climate==
Edsbyn has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long winters with occasional strong cold periods and short but mild summers. Being situated in a river valley at a moderately high elevation surrounded by high hills, the settlement is in a frost hollow. This results in large swings between different times of the day and larger seasonal variations than seen elsewhere in Hälsingland.

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Edsbyn:

* Edsbyns IF – bandy
* Edsbyns IF FF – football

Edsbyns IF is renowned for its successes in men&#x27;s bandy. The first indoor bandy arena in Sweden, Edsbyn Arena, was built in Edsbyn and dedicated in 2003 by King Carl XVI Gustaf.

<text>Hyltebruk () is a locality and the seat of Hylte Municipality, Halland County, Sweden with 3,716 inhabitants in 2010.

The town grew up around the paper mill owned by &quot;Hylte Bruks AB&quot;, which started its operation in 1907. A railway was built in 1909 connecting it with Torup on the Halmstad-Nässjö line. The paper mill today has nearly 1,000 employees and is one of the greatest manufacturers of newsprint in the world.

In the 20th century the town was popular due to the farming it had produced that had led to increased tourist sites and also now has opened several different hotels in its regions to attract more tourists in the spring and summer seasons.
