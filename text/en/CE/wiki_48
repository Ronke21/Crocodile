<text>Rooney is the primary musical project of singer-songwriter Robert Schwartzman, evolving from its origin as an American rock band formed by high school friends in Los Angeles. Before Schwartzman decided to continue with the project and take it in a different direction, the band&#x27;s most enduring line-up consisted of Schwartzman (lead vocals, guitar), Louie Stephens (keyboards, piano), Taylor Locke (lead guitar, backing vocals), Matthew Winter (bass guitar) and Ned Brower (drums, backing vocals). The band is named after Ed Rooney, the principal in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; portrayed by actor Jeffrey Jones.

Their music is reminiscent of Jellyfish and Sloan. They have toured the nation with acts such as Weezer, The Strokes, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Travis, Keane, Audioslave, OK Go, Queens of the Stone Age, and Electric Light Orchestra.

==History==
===1999–2002: Formation===
Rooney first formed as Ed Rooney in 1999. The original lineup consisted of Robert Schwartzman, Matthew Winter on bass, Teddy Briggs on drums, and Matthew Star (née Srolestar) and Taylor Locke on guitar. Ned Brower replaced Briggs as drummer and Louie Stephens was added as keyboardist. They released a series of independent EPs called &quot;Deli Meats&quot; (2000), &quot;Plug It In&quot; (2001), and &quot;Mastedonia&quot; (2002).
The band played multiple shows a month around Los Angeles and Anaheim and built up a strong following. Schwartzman moved to New York City to attend the Eugene Lang College at the New School. Instead of writing papers, he spent his dorm room nights writing new Rooney songs. Schwartzman sent his latest material to his bandmates in LA and flew home every month to perform. They recorded another demo CD with producers Keith Forsey and Brian Reeves. It consisted of the songs &quot;Popstars,&quot; &quot;If It Were Up To Me,&quot; and &quot;Losing All Control.&quot; The demo made its way around LA and created buzz for the band at the major labels and management companies. Schwartzman decided to leave school and pursue the band full-time. Rooney played a show at the Roxy in early 2002 packed with Rooney fans and A&amp;R representatives. After the show, the president of Geffen Records approached the band. After meeting all interested parties, the band went to Interscope to meet with Jimmy Iovine. Iovine expressed his love for the demo and said he would produce a couple of tracks himself if they signed with them. Based on their roster, Rooney signed the deal with Geffen/Interscope in 2002.

===2003–04: Debut album===
The band was interested in having Ric Ocasek produce the album. Ocasek got his hands on the demo CD and immediately contacted Schwartzman. They spent a lot of time talking about the songs and Ocasek wanted to use the demo songs on the album, feeling they were finished. Rooney flew out to New York City for a show with Phantom Planet at CBGB&#x27;s. Schwartzman loved Ocasek&#x27;s pink Jazzmaster, the one he used in The Cars. Ocasek said he could use it for the show, but Schwartzman took it back to LA and held on to it for quite a while. The label liked the idea of Ocasek producing the album, but since he loved the demos so much, everyone thought that Keith Forsey and Brian Reeves, who recorded the demos, should be given the opportunity.

Once the band and producers decided on the material and Taylor and Louie graduated from high school, they started recording at NRG Studios in North Hollywood, California. Most of basic tracking was done at NRG. They moved to The Jungle Room in Burbank to finish the album.

The label wasn&#x27;t happy with the way &quot;I&#x27;m Shakin&#x27;&quot; sounded. The band tried it different ways, but it just wasn&#x27;t right. The band asked Iovine, who had agreed to produce two tracks, to produce the song. Iovine hired engineer Adam Kasper to run the session. They recorded at Village Studios in West Los Angeles. Tension was running high, and the session took over three weeks. Iovine felt the song came out great and approved Andy Wallace to mix the album. Wallace allegedly broke down in tears when he was asked.

The band hit the road with Weezer shortly after they finished recording. Then their friends The Strokes asked Rooney to open for them on their fall headline tour in 2002. At the end of the year, still no album out, they sold out a show at the Palace Theater (now the Avalon) in Hollywood. The band was frustrated that the album wasn&#x27;t released, but the label assured them it would be out the summer of 2003. The band toured with The Donnas and OK Go, followed by a tour with Pete Yorn and Grandaddy. Finally the album was released May 20, 2003. The band hit the road on Lollapalooza 2003, its first year back as a national tour. The acts included The Namedroppers, Audioslave, Queens of the Stone Age, Jurassic 5, Incubus, The Donnas, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, and Rooney (on the main stage).

&quot;Blueside&quot; was the lead-off single, which gained much play on alternative radio. The band was over the moon when they heard their song on their hometown radio station KROQ. The song was also featured in the video game &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004&quot;.

Album sales were slow until in 2004, when they had a cameo appearance in an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;The Third Wheel&quot;, where they sang the songs &quot;Sorry Sorry&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Shakin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Popstars&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Terrible Person&quot;. The latter was used in the commercial of Carolina Herrera&#x27;s fragrance CH, in 2007. &quot;Blueside&quot; was featured on the &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004&quot; soundtrack and &quot;I&#x27;m Shakin&#x27;&quot; was featured on an episode of the daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;.

On November 16, 2004, the band issued their first DVD, &quot;Spit &amp; Sweat&quot;. The hour-long documentary features interviews with the band and live performances from Los Angeles. The DVD also includes the videos for &quot;Blueside&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Shakin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;If It Were Up to Me&quot;.

===2005–08: &quot;Calling the World&quot;===
Following their summer tour, the band began their third sessions for a second album. Only three songs from the previous sessions (&quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Again,&quot; &quot;Paralyzed,&quot; and &quot;Tell Me Soon&quot;), were kept for their new album, &quot;Calling the World&quot;. On March 6, 2007, the single &quot;When Did Your Heart Go Missing?&quot; was released on their official MySpace. The single also was used in commercials of the TV show &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot;. It was also used in an episode of &quot;Newport Harbor: The Real Orange County&quot;, in the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Wild Brunch&quot; and in the movie &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;. The album was released to stores July 17, 2007 and debuted #42 on The Billboard Top 100 Albums chart.

Between the release of the first album and &quot;Calling the World&quot;, Rooney recorded, produced, and mastered two complete albums that were subsequently scrapped. Schwartzman has stated his desire to re-record these two albums for release in 2011.

Rooney headed out on a headlining tour dubbed &quot;The Calling the World Tour&quot; in May 2008 in the United States, which was scheduled to run through August. The band said during live shows that they planned to record a new album upon the completion of the tour.

===2009–11: &quot;The Wild One&quot; and &quot;Eureka&quot;===
Rooney worked on the theme for the show &quot;Iron Man: Armored Adventures&quot; on the Nicktoons network. The song premiered online on March 29, 2009, and the show launched on April 24, 2009.

Rooney became free agents, not attached to any record label. The new self-released EP &quot;Wild One&quot; was exclusively available only at live shows. The band started a winter tour with Tally Hall and Crash Kings on November 27, 2009, in Los Angeles. The tour went through most of December. The band streamed several songs from the album on MySpace days before the official first day of the tour. The EP was subsequently available for sale on Amazon&#x27;s MP3 and Apple&#x27;s iTunes stores.

Rooney&#x27;s third full-length album was released on June 8, 2010, through California Dreamin&#x27; Records, Warner Music Group&#x27;s Independent Label Group. The album features the lead single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; and the final appearance of bassist Matthew Winter, who announced his departure from the band in February 2010. With new bassist Brandon Schwartzel, Rooney toured again nationally in Summer 2010 with bands The Young Veins and Black Gold supporting.
&quot;Holdin&#x27; On&quot; was released as the second single in 2011.

===2016–present: New line up and &quot;Washed Away&quot;===

In February 2016 Robert Schwartzman announced in a newsletter that the band is in the process of recording new material and will feature an entirely new line-up. They also released a new song for free download entitled &quot;Come On Baby&quot;. Regarding the decision to continue with a new line-up, Schwartzman stated, &quot;I met all the guys who played with Rooney for so many years in high school, and it was sort of like a high school relationship where you marry your high school sweetheart kind of thing, right out of school. And I think as you grow up, you realize, like, &#x27;Who am I? What do I want?&#x27;, and you start to connect with new people. And I started to meet all these other musicians that I had collaborated with, and it was over that hiatus that I kind of came back around to recording music that just felt like Rooney, kind of returning to this Rooney sound. I think everyone in the band for so long has been pursuing so many other things, that I think naturally it was time to make a change and shift to bring in new people.&quot;

On March 4, 2016, Schwartzman announced the new Rooney single, &quot;My Heart Beats 4 U&quot;. The new album, titled &quot;Washed Away&quot;, was released on May 16. Schwartzman performed most of the instruments on the album, along with several session musicians including guitarist Taylor Johnson and drummer Joel Plotnik, both of whom have been among the rotating cast of players in the current live line-up of Rooney. Other musicians who have performed live in Rooney shows since the return from hiatus in early 2016 include Ben Messelbeck (bass), Phil Danyew (keyboards), Mike McKee (keyboards) and Brian Henspeter (drums).

<doc id="918822" wikidata="Q49541" url="?curid=918822" title="Delta III">
<text>Delta III was an expendable launch vehicle made by McDonnell Douglas (later acquired by Boeing). Development was canceled before the vehicle became operational. The vehicle is the third generation of the Delta rocket family, developed from the highly successful Delta II to help meet the launch demand of larger satellites. While the Delta III never had a successful launch, some of the technologies developed were used in its successor, the Delta IV.

The Delta III was the first to use the Delta Cryogenic Second Stage, which was designed by the National Space Development Agency of Japan based on the second stage it developed for the H-IIA rocket and built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Contraves built the fairing and payload adapters based on designs it used on the Ariane 4.

The first Delta III launch was on August 26, 1998. Of its three flights, the first two were failures, and the third, though declared successful, reached the low end of its targeted orbit range and carried only a dummy (inert) payload. The Delta III could deliver up to to geostationary transfer orbit, twice the payload of its predecessor, the Delta II. Under the four-digit designation system from earlier Delta rockets, the Delta III is classified as the Delta 8930.

== History ==
Due to the continual size and mass growth of commercial satellites in the late 1980s, McDonnell Douglas realized the need for a higher-performance rocket than even their new Delta II. New satellite bus offerings from Hughes required a launch vehicle with a 4-meter diameter payload fairing as well as the ability to send 3.5 tons of payload to a geostationary transfer orbit – neither of which Delta II offered.

Multiple options for evolving the Delta II to support larger payloads were considered in the late 1980s and early 1990s, namely using higher-performing liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen upper stages. Eventually, the Delta III was announced in 1995, boasting an evolved Delta II first stage and a second stage based on that of the Japanese H-II rocket. This led to Delta III being similar in size to Delta II, meaning that the existing Delta II infrastructure at SLC-17B could be used after some modifications. Soon after the announcement, Hughes placed an order for 13 Delta III launches.

Delta III would only fly three times. The first two launches, both carrying live satellites, ended in failure. The third and final launch, carrying a dummy payload, was only partially successful after the RL-10B second-stage engine shut down prematurely. After commercial interest declined, the Delta III program was officially ended in 2003. Boeing then transitioned their focus to the new Delta IV rocket, which was much more capable than Delta III.

Multiple Delta III rockets were already built and would have been unused, but they were cannibalized for parts for both Delta II and Delta IV.

== Description ==
Delta III was developed from the Delta II rocket. The new vehicle sported a modified first stage and a new, more efficient upper stage. This led to Delta III having around double the payload capacity of Delta II. However, the consecutive failures of the initial Delta IIIs, combined with the more advanced Delta IV program and the continuing success of the Delta II, left the Delta III as an interim vehicle.

=== First stage ===
Like the Delta II, the first stage of the Delta III burned kerosene and liquid oxygen and was powered by one Rocketdyne RS-27A main engine with two LR-101-NA-11 vernier engines for roll control. The vernier engines were also used for attitude control after the main engine shut down, just before the second stage separated. While the propellant load and gross mass of the stage were nearly identical to the Delta II, the diameter of the kerosene tank was increased from 2.4 meters to 4 meters, while its height was reduced. The liquid oxygen tank and engine section remained largely unchanged. The redesigned kerosene tank reduced the overall length of the stage and, combined with the increased height of the second stage, allowed Delta III to use the same launch facilities as Delta II with only minor modifications.

The first stage thrust was augmented by nine GEM-46 solid rocket boosters, sometimes referred to as GEM LDXL (Large Diameter Extended Length). These were meters in length, 1.2 m (46 inches) in diameter, and had a mass of 19 metric tons each, about six metric tons more than the Delta II&#x27;s standard GEM-40 motors. Six were ignited on the launch pad, while the remaining three were ignited just before burnout and separation of the ground-lit boosters. To maintain steering authority, three of the ground-lit boosters had vectoring nozzles. GEM-46 boosters would later find use on Delta II, creating the Delta II Heavy variant.

=== Delta Cryogenic Second Stage ===

The second stage of the Delta III was the newly developed Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS), which burned liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. It was developed and manufactured partly by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and was based on the second stage of JAXA&#x27;s H-IIA rocket. Boeing was in charge of preliminary design and the development of new technologies, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was responsible for manufacturing. The liquid hydrogen tank was meters in diameter while the separate liquid oxygen tank (attached by a truss to the bottom of the hydrogen tank) was around meters in diameter. This stage offered significantly better performance than the Delta II&#x27;s second stage, the Delta-K, which burned hypergolic propellants. The DCSS was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney RL10B-2 engine, derived from the RL10 powering the Centaur upper stage but featuring electromechanical actuators for gimbal control and an extending nozzle for increased performance. After Delta III&#x27;s retirement, the DCSS design was modified for use as the Delta IV&#x27;s second stage in both the original 4-meter diameter form factor as well as a larger 5-meter diameter stage. A further refinement of the 5-meter diameter DCSS, known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, is used on the Block I Space Launch System rocket.

Control of the second stage was provided by 4 sets of hydrazine thrusters installed around the bottom of the liquid oxygen tank. During engine burns, these thrusters only provided roll control (as the engine itself could gimbal for pitch and yaw). During coast periods, these would then provide 3-axis control.

=== Star 48B third stage ===
Delta III was offered with an optional Star 48B solid-fueled third stage. It would have been attached on top of the DCSS and contained inside the payload fairing. The Star 48B would have been used for high-energy orbits, like geostationary or interplanetary missions. It was never flown on Delta III but was commonly used on Delta II missions. The Star 48B has also seen use on Delta IV and Atlas V.

=== Payload fairing ===
Delta III&#x27;s payload fairing was a new composite design, matching the upper stage hydrogen tank&#x27;s diameter and allowing larger payloads than the Delta II&#x27;s 9.5 or 10-foot-diameter fairing. Delta III&#x27;s 4-meter fairing was derived from Delta II&#x27;s 10 ft composite fairing. This fairing design would later be repurposed on the Delta IV Medium.

<text>Dino Grandi, 1st Conte di Mordano (4 June 1895 – 21 May 1988), was an Italian Fascist politician, minister of justice, minister of foreign affairs and president of Parliament.

== Early life ==
Born at Mordano, province of Bologna, Grandi was a graduate in law and economics at the University of Bologna in 1919 (after serving in World War I). Grandi started a career as a lawyer in Imola. Attracted to the political left, he nonetheless became impressed with Benito Mussolini after the two met in 1914, and became a staunch advocate of Italy&#x27;s entry into the World War.

He joined the Blackshirts at age 25, and was one of 35 Fascist delegates elected, along with Mussolini, in May 1921 to the Chamber of Deputies. Grandi survived an ambush carried out by leftist militants in 1920, and had his studio devastated on one occasion.

== Fascist statesman ==

After the March on Rome on 28 October 1922, in which the Fascists took power in Italy, Grandi became part of the new government; first as the undersecretary of the interior (1923), then as the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs (1929) and then as Italy&#x27;s ambassador to the United Kingdom (1932 to 1939). Grandi was an ally to the most radical and violent groups of fascists, always surrounding himself with members of the Blackshirts. He used his power base to voice criticism of Mussolini&#x27;s attempt to reach an armistice with left-wingers and was at one point under suspicion for having attempted to replace the latter with the skeptical alleged Mussolini forerunner Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio.

In 1939, he was recalled to Italy after attempting a pact between his country and Britain to prevent Italy from entering World War II. Under pressure from Hitler, Mussolini removed him from the post of ambassador and appointed him Minister of Justice. As a diplomat, Grandi created a net of connections that were rivaled only by Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, and he attempted to use it for his own gains. Thus, he persuaded King Victor Emmanuel III to grant him a title in 1937, and he managed to retain a comfortable position until he was sent by Mussolini to the Greek Front with the other &quot;Gerarchi&quot; in 1941. As Mussolini&#x27;s ambassador to London, he had affairs with some of the most influential noblewomen of the time, including Lady Alexandra Curzon, daughter of the Viceroy of India, George Curzon.

Grandi opposed the antisemitic Italian racial laws of 1938, and the country&#x27;s entry into World War II. He was dropped from the Cabinet in February 1943 for his increasing criticism of the war effort.

== Fall of Mussolini and aftermath ==

As the war began to have its devastating effect on Italy after the Allied invasion of Sicily, Grandi and other members of the Fascist Grand Council met on 24 July 1943. When Mussolini said that the Germans were thinking of evacuating the south, Grandi launched a blistering attack on his former comrade-in-arms. He then made a motion (&quot;Ordine del giorno Grandi&quot;) asking King Victor Emmanuel III to resume his full constitutional authority. The resolution, voted at 2:00 on 25 July, passed by a vote of 19 to 8, with one abstention, effectively removing Mussolini from office. Those leading government figures who had voted for the resolution included Giuseppe Bottai and Emilio De Bono as well as Grandi. The King had Mussolini arrested the same day. Grandi also negotiated a truce with the left-wing movements, notably with the trade unions (grouped in the Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro), which gave way to the Italian resistance movement against Nazi Germany.

While the Allies occupied the south, an alternate Fascist government was established in Northern Italy as the Italian Social Republic. It sentenced Grandi to death &quot;in absentia&quot; for treason in the Verona trial that took place on 8 to 10 January 1944. Grandi, however, had made sure to flee to Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spain in August 1943. He lived there, then in Portugal (1943–1948), Argentina, and then São Paulo, Brazil, until he returned to Italy in the 1960s; he died in Bologna. Coincidentally, Grandi died on the same weekend as two post-war Italian Fascist leaders. Like Grandi, Pino Romualdi died on 21 May 1988, and Giorgio Almirante died the following day.

<text>Finn Tugwell (born 18 March 1976) is a Danish table tennis player who currently plays for Roskilde BTK. He paired up with Danish Michael Maze in doubles, with whom he won the bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics, beating the Russian pair Dmitry Mazunov/Alexey Smirnov.

His highest world ranking was 65th in October 2004.

== Forgery ==
In 2009, Finn Tugwell was given a suspended 40 day prison sentence for document forgery. He had been driving around with a parking card for the disabled in his window that he wasn&#x27;t eligible for. While in court, Finn explained that he had picked up the sign and put it in his window temporarily because he wanted to find some place to hand it in.

<text>Papaver is a genus of 70–100 species of frost-tolerant annuals, biennials, and perennials native to temperate and cold regions of Eurasia, Africa and North America. It is the type genus of the [[poppy]] family, Papaveraceae.

==Description==
The flowers have two sepals that fall off as the bud opens, and four (or up to six) petals in red, pink, orange, yellow, or lilac. There are many stamens in several whorls around a compound pistil, which results from the fusion of carpels. The stigmas are visible on top of the capsule, and the number of stigmas corresponds to the number of fused carpels.

The ovary later develops into a dehiscing capsule, capped by the dried stigmas. The opened capsule scatters its numerous, tiny seeds as air movement shakes it, due to the long stem.

The typical &quot;Papaver&quot; gynoecium is superior (the flower is hypogynous) with a globular ovary. The style is characteristically absent for the type species opium poppy, and several others, although those with a style do exist. The sessile plate-like stigmata lies on top of the ovary. Pollen-receptive surfaces. The characteristic fruit type of &quot;Papaver&quot; is the unilocular capsule. The stigmatic disc rests on top of the capsule, and beneath it are dehiscent pores or valves.

==Taxonomy==

Divided into a number of sections by Kiger (1973, 1985), the following are lectotypified with their lectotype species. Subsequent cladistic classification by Carolan &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) suggested &quot;Papaver&quot; was not monophyletic.

*Clade 1. &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Meconella&quot;, &quot;Meconopsis&quot;
*Clade 2. &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Carinatae&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Meconidium&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Oxytona&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Papaver&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Pilosa&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Pseudopilosa&quot;, &quot;P. cambrica&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Californicum&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Horrida&quot; and &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Rhoeadium&quot;
*Clade 3. &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Argemonidium&quot;, &quot;Roemeria refracta&quot;

The following are lectotypified with their lectotype species:
* &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Carinatae&quot; (&quot;P. macrostomum&quot; Boiss. &amp; Huet)
* &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Oxytona&quot; (&quot;P. orientale&quot; L.)
* &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Macrantha&quot; (&quot;P. orientale&quot; L.) - superfluous
* &quot;P.&quot; sect. &quot;Calomecon&quot; (&quot;Calomecon orientale&quot;)

==Phylogeny of &quot;Papaver&quot; and related genera==
&quot;Papaver&quot; sect. &quot;Argemonidium&quot; includes four annual, half-rosette species, &quot;P. argemone&quot;, &quot;P. pavonium&quot;, &quot;P. apulum&quot;, and &quot;P. hybridum&quot; (Kadereit 1986a). &quot;Papaver apulum,&quot; &quot;P. argemone&quot; and &quot;P. pavonium&quot; occur allopatrically from the Adriatic Sea to the Himalayan range. &quot;P. hybridum&quot; is distributed widely from the Himalayas to Macaronesian Islands. These species are easily distinguished in petal and capsule characters, but are clearly closely related according to molecular analysis. &quot;Argemonidium&quot; is a sister group to all other &quot;Papaver&quot; sections, with characteristic indels. Morphological characters also support this distinction, including the presence of an apical plug in the capsules, long internodes above the basal leaf rosette, bristly capsules and polyporate pollen grains. Carolan et al. (2006) supported Kadereit et al. (1997)’s suggestions that &quot;Argemonidium&quot; and &quot;Roemeria&quot; are in fact sister taxa. They share some morphological characters that distinguish them from &quot;Papaver&quot;, including polyporate pollen grains, and long internodes superior the basal leaf rosette. Previous taxonomies of the Old World clade did include the close relationship between &quot;Argemonidium&quot; and &quot;Roemeria&quot;, nor &quot;Argemonidium&quot;’s distinctness from &quot;Papaver&quot; s.s. Carolan suggest &quot;Argemonidium&quot; be elevated to genus status, with &quot;Roemeria&quot; a sub-genus.

&quot;Papaver&quot; sect. &quot;Meconella&quot; is widely distributed, with populations spanning central, inner and eastern Asia, Siberia, Scandinavia, northern Greenland, Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and regions of Europe. It has been distinguished from other &quot;Papaver&quot; sections morphologically by its bristly, valvate capsules, pinnatisect leaves, pale stamen, and white, orange or yellow corolla. Older taxonomies divided &quot;Meconella&quot; into two groups based on degree of leaf dissection (finely dissected leaves vs. broad leaf lobes). Kadereit (1990) and Kadereit and Sytsma (1992) regarded finely dissected leaves as a derived character, and suggested that &quot;Meconella&quot; formed a group with &quot;Argemonidium&quot; as sister to other &quot;Papaver&quot; sects. Bittkau and Kadereit (2002) demonstrated that for &quot;P. alpinum&quot; s.l. broad leaf lobes were ancestral. Carolan et al. (2006) resolved &quot;Meconopsis&quot; as sister to sect. &quot;Meconella&quot;, forming a sister clade to the rest of &quot;Papaver&quot;, excluding &quot;Argemonidium&quot;. &quot;Meconella&quot; possesses a sessile stigmatic disc, similar to the typical discs of &quot;Papaver&quot; sect. &quot;Papaver&quot;., yet differences in the disc and other morphological characters have led to suggestions that this feature may not be homologous. The results of the Carolan &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) analysis present a major problem to previous taxonomy of the genera &quot;Meconopsis&quot;, and &quot;Papaver&quot;. As several species of &quot;Meconopsis&quot; (excluding &quot;M. cambrica&quot;) and &quot;P. Meconella&quot; resolved as a monophyletic group, sister to other &quot;Papaver&quot; sects., either &quot;Meconella&quot; must be elevated to genus status, or combined with the Asian species of &quot;Meconopsis&quot;, as a subgenus of &quot;Papaver&quot;.
&quot;Papaver&quot; sects. &quot;Californicum&quot; and &quot;Horrida&quot; have unique geographic distributions in relation to the rest of the genus. &quot;Horrida&quot; is represented by a single species &quot;Papaver aculeatum&quot; of, an annual flower native to South Africa. The capsule is glabrous narrow, long and poricidal. The vegetative parts are covered with setae, and the growth form is a rosette with rarely branching axes, and narrowly elliptical incised leaves. P. sect. californicum, is also represented by a single annual species, of the same name. As the name implies, it is native to western North America, and is characterized by a slender, ribbed, glabrous capsule, a racemose inflorescence, yellow anthers and filaments, and valvate capsule dehiscece. Previous morphological-based taxonomies of these species have led to unreliable groupings. &quot;Horrida&quot; and &quot;Pilosa&quot; have racemose inflorescences, pale filiform filaments and long capsules with flat stigmatic discs, while &quot;P. californicum&quot; and sect. &quot;Meconidium&quot; share valvate capsule dehiscence and pale filaments, but geographically these species are distinct, and do not follow molecular evidence. Commonality among these features is therefore hypothesized to be a result of convergence. In Carolan et al.’s (2006) combined ITS, trnL-F trees, both &quot;Horrida&quot; and &quot;Californicum&quot; attach to basal nodes within the main clade &quot;Papaver&quot;. Kadereit &quot;et al.&quot; (1997) postulated that &quot;Stylomecon heterophylla&quot; arose from within &quot;Papaver&quot; and should not be relegated as a separate genus. &quot;S. heterophylla&quot; and &quot;P. californicum&quot; are both native to southwestern North America, and share habitats. They are also morphologically similar, sharing glabrous buds, bright orange corollas, and yellow anthers. Their capsules are different, with &quot;S. heterophylla&quot; possessing a distinct style that is reminiscent of those in many &quot;Meconopsis&quot; species. However, Carolan et al.’s (2006) analysis strongly supports a monophyletic group for &quot;S. heterophylla&quot; and &quot;P. californicum&quot;, sister to the core &quot;Papaver&quot; sects, with &quot;Horrida&quot;, basal to that grouping. They recommended that both sects. &quot;Californicum&quot; and &quot;Horrida&quot; be elevated to “subgenera” within &quot;Papaver&quot;. The authors reject the genus status of &quot;Stylomecon&quot;.

&quot;Meconopsis&quot; is composed of mostly Asian dwelling species, and a single European representative, &quot;M. cambrica&quot;. Kadereit et al. (1997) first provided evidence that this relationship is not monophyletic. Carolan et al. (2006) confirmed the separation of &quot;M. cambrica&quot; from the rest of &quot;Meconopsis&quot;. In fact, it forms a well-supported sister-group to the core sections of &quot;Papaver&quot;, excluding &quot;Argemonidium&quot;, &quot;Californicum&quot;, &quot;Horrida&quot; and &quot;Meconella&quot;.

The core sections of &quot;Papaver&quot; s.s. form a well-supported clade, consisting of &quot;Pseudopilosa&quot;, &quot;Pilosa&quot;, &quot;Papaver&quot;, &quot;Carinatae&quot;, &quot;Meconidium&quot;, &quot;Oxytona&quot;, and &quot;Rhoeadium&quot;. &quot;Pseudopilosa&quot; spp. have a subscapose growth habit, and their distribution includes south-western Asia, northern Africa and southern Spain. There are some leaves on the lower part of the flower axis carrying a single flower. Carolan et al.’s (2006) analysis placed &quot;Pseudopilosa&quot; as sister to the remaining &quot;Papaver&quot; s.s. sections. &quot;Pilosa&quot; is a single species, &quot;P. pilosum&quot;, found mostly in western Turkey Sects. &quot;Pilosa&quot; and &quot;Pseudopilosa&quot; are separated based on morphological and chemical differences.
The monophyly of &quot;Carinatae&quot;, &quot;Papaver&quot; and &quot;Rhoeadium&quot; is questionable based on current molecular evidence. &quot;Papaver&quot; sect. &quot;Rhoeadium&quot; comprises seventeen annual species. Carolan et al. (2006) use three representative species, &quot;P. commutatum&quot;, &quot;P. dubium&quot;, and &quot;P. rhoeas&quot; for their genetic analysis. The geographic center of &quot;Rhoeadium&quot;’s diversity is in south-western Asia and the Aegean area. They have poricidal capsules and usually dark filaments. This section is morphologically diverse however, leading Kadereit (1989) to recognize three distinct groups. The first comprises species with tetraploid and hexaploid genomes, with long capsules. The second group contains diploid species and diverse morphologies. The third group consists of diploid species and uniform morphologies. Carolan et al. (2006) showed some incongruences between their trnL-F and ITS maximum parsimony trees, showing weak support for Kadereit&#x27;s (1989) groupings. Further analyses with more species and more samples will be necessary to resolve the phylogeny at this level.

&quot;Papaver&quot; has traditionally been characterized by the absence of a stigma, and the presence of a sessile stigmatic disc. Carolan et al. (2006) demonstrated that several species with this trait however are closely related to taxa possessing a style e.g. &quot;S. heterophylla&quot; and &quot;P. californicum&quot;, and P. sect. &quot;Meconella&quot; and Asian &quot;Meconopsis&quot;. This evidence, in combination with morphological differences among the discs suggests convergent evolutionary pathways. &quot;Papaver&quot; has long been considered the most derived clade within Papaveroideae, due to the belief that the stigmatic disc was an apomorphous characteristic. Sections &quot;Meconella&quot; and &quot;Californicum&quot; exhibit valvate dehiscence, and their basal position within &quot;Papaver&quot; suggest this may be an ancestral form. Its presence in &quot;Meconidium&quot;, however, suggests it is also a synapomorphy within that group.

Note: &quot;Meconella&quot; (not to be confused with the genus &quot;Meconella&quot;) has an alpine and circumpolar arctic distribution and includes some of the most northerly-growing vascular land plants.

==History and uses==
Poppies have been grown as ornamental plants since 5000 BC in Mesopotamia. They were found in Egyptian tombs. In Greek mythology, the poppy was associated with Demeter, goddess of fertility and agriculture. The origin of the cultural symbol was probably Minoan Crete, because a figurine known as the &quot;poppy goddess&quot; was found at a Minoan sanctuary in Crete.

In the course of history, poppies have always been attributed important medicinal properties. The stems contain a milky latex that may cause skin irritation, and the latex in the opium poppy (&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;) contains several narcotic alkaloids, including morphine and codeine. The alkaloid rhoeadine, derived from the flowers of the corn poppy (&quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;), is used as a mild sedative. Poppy seeds are used in baking and cooking, and poppyseed oil is used in cooking and pharmaceuticals, and as a radiocontrast agent.

The ancient Greeks portrayed Hypnos, Nyx and Thanatos, the gods of sleep, night and death, with the symbol of the poppy. The earliest written record appeared in the eighth century BC. Early Greek accounts seem to indicate the plant was used for euthanasia; on some Greek islands, women used it in old age to shorten the time left until natural death. Hippocrates (460–377 BC) was one of the first to emphasize the medicinal uses of the poppy and outline several methods of preparation. He described poppy juice as narcotic, hypnotic, and cathartic. He also recognized the plant&#x27;s uses as food, particularly the seeds. By the first century AD, Dioskorides wrote down the first poppy taxonomy. He distinguished between several different kinds, the first of which was the &quot;cultivated&quot; or &quot;garden&quot; poppies. He further distinguished two types within this category, ones with black and others with white seeds. Both had elongated capsules and the black-seeded variety was involuted. Historians speculate this variety was &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;. Other species were in use, as well. Dioskorides named the “flowering” poppy as a type with strong hypnotic properties. This is believed to be &quot;Papaver hybridum&quot;. Finally, the “wild” poppy he described is believed to be &quot;Papaver orientale&quot;. Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, later mentioned an “intermediate” type between the wild and cultivated poppy, likely &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;. He wrote about medical applications of the plant; the leaves and capsules were boiled in water to create juice, pressed and rubbed to create tablets, and the dried latex was used to form opium. These products were used in much the same way they are in many cultures today, to promote sleep and to relieve indigestion and respiratory problems.

A century later, Galen wrote even more extensively about the diverse applications of various poppy products. He wrote that opium was the strongest known drug for dulling the senses and for inducing sleep. He wrote about its use to treat a variety of ailments, including eye and lung inflammation.

The First (18391842) and Second Opium Wars (18561860) between China and Great Britain resulted from attempts by successive Chinese emperors to suppress increasing imports of opium into the country. In the first half of the 19th century, poppy seed oil was an important food crop, but large-scale production did not begin until Europe began to manufacture morphine in the mid-19th century. While 800–1000 tons of Indian opium are processed legally each year, this represents only an estimated 5% of total opium production worldwide; the majority is produced illegally. The first factory specializing in dry capsule processing was built in 1928.

Today, morphine and codeine are common alkaloids found in several poppy varieties, and are important drugs for much of the world. Australia, Turkey and India are the most important producers of poppy for medicinal use, while the US, the UK, France, Australia and Hungary are the largest processors. In the United States, opium is illegal, as is possession or cultivation of the flower itself. However, the law is seldom enforced when poppies are grown for culinary or ornamental use. The Opium Poppy Control Act Of 1942 led to the “Poppy Rebellion”, and a battle between California farmers and the federal government. Today, the law and its enforcement remain vague and controversial, even inciting episodes between gardeners and &quot;the poppy police&quot;.

They are also sold as cut flowers in flower arrangements, especially the Iceland poppy.

<doc id="918852" wikidata="Q16417" url="?curid=918852" title="The Photo Album">
<text>The Photo Album is the third studio album by indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, released October 9, 2001 on Barsuk Records.

The albums spawned three singles: &quot;A Movie Script Ending&quot;, &quot;I Was a Kaleidoscope&quot;, and &quot;We Laugh Indoors&quot;. All of the singles charted on the UK Singles Chart, with the highest-charting song &quot;I Was a Kaleidoscope&quot; peaking at number 115. &quot;The Photo Album&quot; was the first Death Cab for Cutie album to feature charting songs, with &quot;A Movie Script Ending&quot; also becoming the first of three songs by the band to eventually feature on the television show &quot;The O.C.&quot;. It was the only full-length album to feature drummer Michael Schorr.

A limited edition extended play called &quot;The Stability EP&quot; was released in early 2002, containing bonus tracks from the limited edition and Japanese versions of &quot;The Photo Album&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;The Photo Album&quot; holds a score of 75 out of 100 from the review aggregating site Metacritic based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. John D. Luerssen of &quot;Billboard&quot; gave the album a very favorable review and said, &quot;If it&#x27;s true that music of this nature doesn&#x27;t get anymore heartfelt, it also rarely gets more infectious.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; wrote that the band &quot;weave together smartly taut guitars with vivid observational lyrics to create perfectly crafted pop songs, stunning in their simplicity and beauty&quot;, while &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called the album &quot;the skillful meshing of Benjamin Gibbard&#x27;s part-stream-of-consciousness, part-confessional vocals with melancholy piano and achingly melodic guitars that reveal a fleshed-out Cutie are indeed a band of uncommon beauty.&quot; Nude as the News gave it a score of eight out of ten and stated, &quot;While not every song is a gem, the ones that are have pushed the band&#x27;s already high standard of compelling indie pop one notch higher.&quot; Neumu.net gave it seven stars out of ten and called it &quot;evidence of a band that&#x27;s maturing, slowing down and trying new things.&quot; Drawer B gave it a positive review and stated, &quot;The most noteworthy aspect of &quot;The Photo Album&quot; is the band&#x27;s upward trajectory. The music is cohesive and even, though still somewhat sluggish.&quot;

In a mixed assessment, Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the album &quot;is often marked by pleasant but static, middle-of-the-road material.&quot; Melanie Haupt of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;It&#x27;s a rare talent that can express such emotions so concisely; even more rare is the ability to deliver them in a near-whisper rather than a scream.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; wrote, &quot;Full of beautiful pop songs, &quot;The Photo Album&quot; is just that—a collection of vignettes.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a three-star honorable mention rating, indicating &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure&quot;.

<doc id="918856" wikidata="Q7899050" url="?curid=918856" title="Upper school">
<text>Upper schools in the UK are usually schools within secondary education. Outside England, the term normally refers to a section of a larger school.

==England==

===The three-tier model===

Upper schools are a type of secondary school found in a minority of English local education authorities. Whilst most areas in England use a two-tier educational system – primary (ages 5–11) and secondary (ages 11–16 or 11–18 if they operate a sixth form) – counties such as Leicestershire, and Suffolk use a three-tier system of lower (ages 5–9 or 10), middle (ages 9 to 13 or 14), and Upper schools (ages 13 or 14 to 16, or 18 if they include Years 12 and 13, known as a Sixth form).

The introduction of such systems began in Leicestershire in 1957. West Yorkshire followed in 1963, but the system has gradually been withdrawn in some areas since the introduction of the National Curriculum. This is because of the nature of the curriculum, which is divided into Key Stages which do not fully align with the three-tier system. In some areas (such as Leicestershire) where this type of school is in use, the middle-tier schools are known as High Schools; in other areas it is the upper tier schools that are called High Schools, especially if they do not include Years 12 and 13.

In 2018, both Northumberland and Bedford were moving away from the three-tier model.

===Grammar schools and Upper schools===

In Buckinghamshire, which retains the 11-plus, the term is used for secondary schools which admit applicants without reference to the test. These are elsewhere sometimes called secondary modern schools).

==United States==
Many independent and some parochial schools in the United States also tend to favor the term &quot;upper school&quot; to designate grades 9–12, normally called &quot;high school&quot;. Schools favoring this terminology may use &quot;middle school&quot; for grades 6–8, &quot;lower school&quot; for grades 1–5, and &quot;early childhood&quot; (education) for pre-K through Kindergarten.

<doc id="918877" wikidata="Q3817417" url="?curid=918877" title="Levitated dipole">
<text>A levitated dipole is a type of nuclear fusion reactor design using a superconducting torus that is magnetically levitated inside the reactor chamber. The name refers to the magnetic dipole that forms within the reaction chamber, similar to Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. It is claimed that such an apparatus could contain plasma more efficiently than other fusion reactor designs. The concept of using one as a fusion reactor was introduced by Akira Hasegawa in 1987.

== Concept ==
The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is generated by the circulation of charges in the Earth&#x27;s molten core. The resulting magnetic dipole field forms a shape with magnetic field lines passing through the Earth&#x27;s center, reaching the surface near the poles and extending far into space above the equator. Charged particles entering the field tend to follow the lines of force, moving north or south. As they reach the polar regions, the magnetic lines cluster. This strengthening field can cause particles below a certain energy threshold to reflect, and begin travelling in the opposite direction. Such particles bounce back and forth between the poles until they collide with other particles. Particles with greater energy continue towards the Earth, impacting the atmosphere and causing auroras.

=== Magnetic mirror ===
This concept is used in the magnetic mirror approach to fusion energy. The mirror uses a solenoid to confine the plasma in the center of a cylinder, and then magnets at both ends force the magnetic lines closer together to create reflecting areas. The mirror ultimately proved to be &quot;leaky&quot;; the fuel refused to properly reflect from the ends as density and energy increased. Unfortunately, particles with the most energy (those most likely to undergo fusion) preferentially escaped. Research into large mirror machines ended in the 1980s.

=== Toroidal mirror ===
The levitated dipole can be thought of as a toroidal mirror, much more similar to the Earth&#x27;s field than the linear system in a traditional mirror. The confinement area is the toroidal area around the outside of the central magnet, similar to the area around the Earth&#x27;s equator. Particles in this area that move out experience increasing magnetic density and tend to move back towards the center, which tends to stabilize the system. Particles with higher energy, those that would escape a traditional mirror, instead follow the field lines through the hollow center of the magnet, recirculating back into the equatorial area.

This makes the levitated dipole unique when compared with other magnetic confinement machines. In those experiments, small fluctuations can cause significant energy loss. By contrast, in a dipolar magnetic field, fluctuations tend to compress the plasma, without energy loss. This compression effect was first noticed by Akira Hasegawa (of the Hasegawa-Mima equation) after participating in the Voyager 2 encounter with Uranus.

== Examples ==
The concept of the levitated dipole was first realized when Jay Kesner of MIT and Michael Mauel of Columbia University made a joint proposal to test the concept in 1997. This led to the development of two experiments: the Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX) at MIT and the Collisionless Terrella Experiment (CTX) at Columbia.

In October 2024, OpenStar Technologies created a cloud of ionized helium contained by a dipole levitated by a permanent magnet. The plasma is managed using a central superconducting magnet. The magnet was precooled to about . The plasma pressure for a given magnetic field is 13 times higher in a dipole machine than in a tokamak. The potential fusion power is more than 150 times larger.

<text>The Netherlands competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Dutch athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games since its official debut in 1908. Netherlands, however, boycotted the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, because of the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The Netherlands National Olympic Committee (, &quot;NOC*NSF&quot;) sent a total of 210 athletes to the Games, 134 men and 76 women, to compete in 21 sports. Baseball, field hockey, and men&#x27;s volleyball were the only team-based sports in which the Netherlands had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in women&#x27;s fencing.

The Dutch team featured five defending Olympic champions: swimming stars Pieter van den Hoogenband and Inge de Bruijn, road and track cyclist Leontien van Moorsel, dressage rider Anky van Grunsven along with her horse Bonfire, and middleweight judoka Mark Huizinga, who later became the Netherlands&#x27; flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Star sailor Mark Neeleman, at age 45, became the first Dutch male athlete to compete in six Olympic Games since 1980 (except the 1988 Summer Olympics, in which he was selected). Shooter Hennie Dompeling sought his fifth Olympic bid as one of the most sophisticated members of the team, having missed the medal podium in the men&#x27;s skeet from Sydney four years earlier. Among the Dutch athletes of the team, several of them were born outside the Netherlands and became naturalized citizens, including sprinter Troy Douglas, who competed for three Olympics under the Bermudian flag, badminton players Mia Audina from Indonesia and Jie Yao from China, and taekwondo jin Charmie Sobers from the Netherlands Antilles.

Netherlands left Athens with a total of 22 Olympic medals, 4 golds, 9 silver, and 9 bronze, failing to achieve three medals short of the record from Sydney. Four Olympic champions managed to defend their titles from the previous Games in their respective events, while van den Hoogenband, de Bruijn, and van Moorsel still emerged as the most decorated Dutch athletes at these Games for the second time with more than a single medal. Seven of these medals were awarded to the athletes in swimming, including two from the freestyle relay teams; four each in cycling and judo, and three in rowing. Netherlands&#x27; team-based athletes proved particularly successful in Athens, as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s field hockey teams took home silver medals.

<text>All the Queen&#x27;s Men is a 2001 English-language action comedy war film directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky and starring Matt LeBlanc and Eddie Izzard. Made on a budget of $15 million, the film received heavily negative reviews from critics, and it earned only $23,662 in the United States.

==Plot==
During World War II the British army is attempting to retrieve an Enigma machine from Germany. Having failed in previous attempts, they decide to send four men undercover to the factory that makes the devices in Berlin. Unfortunately the factory is populated entirely by women, and they only have men to send. American O&#x27;Rourke (LeBlanc), British transvestite Tony Parker (Izzard), genius Johnno (David Birkin), and the reluctant Archie (James Cosmo) are sent to infiltrate the factory dressed as women.

Dropped in the wrong area, the team must first try to find their bearings. Aided by Romy, a sympathiser to their cause, they find their way to the factory. They manage to retrieve the Enigma machine, against the expectations of the British army. Just before they leave Germany, they realize they were tricked—the British government already had the device, but wanted to make the Germans think they were still after it. They were specifically chosen as the team most likely to fail. Leaving Germany with an Enigma machine would, in fact, destroy the usefulness of the machine, as the Germans would know it was stolen and switch to a different code system. Archie volunteers to be captured with the machine to allow the mission to &quot;fail&quot;. After he is captured, the team retrieves him and returns safely to England, leaving the Germans with the impression they have all the Enigma machines and the British are still desperate to obtain one.

==Cast==
* Matt LeBlanc as Captain Steven O&#x27;Rourke
* Eddie Izzard as Lieutenant Tony Parker
* James Cosmo as Major Archie Hartley
* Nicolette Krebitz as Romy
* David Birkin as Johnno
* Edward Fox as Aitken
* Karl Markovics as Hauptsturmführer

== Reception ==
The film was panned by critics, getting an approval rating of 7% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 3.50/10, based on 29 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;All the Queen&#x27;s Men&quot; never capitalizes on its gender-bending conceit, instead relying on low-hanging jokes that never elicit a chuckle.&quot; Roger Ebert mentioned the film in his book &quot;Your Movie Sucks&quot;, terming it &quot;a perfectly good idea for a comedy, but it just plain doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; Ebert also mentions the problem with the plot being about retrieving an Enigma machine when &quot;Anyone who has seen &quot;Enigma&quot;, &quot;U-571&quot;, or the various TV documentaries...will be aware that by the time of the movie, the British already had possession of an Enigma machine... The movie has an answer to it, but it comes so late in the film that although it makes sense technically, the damage has already been done.&quot;

<text>Klerksdorp ( ) is located in the North West Province, South Africa. Klerksdorp is located southeast of Mahikeng, the provincial capital. Klerksdorp was also the first capital of the then Transvaal Republic and used to be the home of the first Stock Exchange in the region. It became an important trading town linking Kimberley to Johannesburg. It became home to a mix of farmers, miners and immigrants servicing the two industries. It was then located there because of availability of water and climate change.

==History==
===Beginnings (1837/38 and on)===
The city was founded in 1837 or 1838 when the Voortrekkers settled on the banks of the &quot;Schoonspruit&quot;  (&quot;Clear stream&quot;), which flows through the town. Klerksdorp is the oldest European settlement north of the Vaal River, and thus of the former Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (Z.A.R), also known as the Transvaal Republic.

The most prominent of the first settlers was Hendrik Grobler who claimed a farm of about , called it &quot;Elandsheuwel&quot; (&quot;Hill of the Eland&quot;). He gave plots of land and communal grazing rights on this farm to other Voortrekkers in return for their labour in building a dam and an irrigation canal. This collection of smallholdings was later given the name of Klerksdorp in honour of the first &quot;landdrost&quot; (magistrate) of the area, Jacob de Clercq.

===City status===
Although Klerksdorp was officially proclaimed a town only in 1888, long before that it was considered a town not only by its residents, but also by visitors and even by authorities.

In 1850 the Rev. A. Murray mentioned the &quot;town on the Schoonspruit&quot; during his trip through the Transvaal. In the same year, an official document, an inspection report, spoke of the &quot;town of Klerksdorp&quot; when the residents requested additional pieces of land.

Seven years later, in 1857, state attorney J. H. Visagie wrote to government secretary C. Moll that it was desirable that regulations be drawn up for Klerksdorp. President M. W. Pretorius then issued regulations for Klerksdorp and Skoonspruit in 1859.

In a letter to the President, magistrate Cornelis Johannes Bodenstein of Potchefstroom in 1863 also designated Klerksdorp as a town.

The Executive Council had a sketch map of the town drawn up in 1871 and according to article 196 of the minutes dated 18 January 1872 the town regulations were approved.

===Gold rush of 1885===
In November 1885 gold was discovered in the Klerksdorp district by M. G. Jansen van Vuuren as well as on the Witwatersrand, which lies about to the east. As a consequence, thousands of fortune-seekers descended on the small village, turning it into a town with 70 taverns and even a stock exchange of its own. This stock exchange opened its doors in 1888 and soon did a roaring trade, selling as much as the equivalent of R20,000 in one day.
However, the nature of the gold reef demanded expensive and sophisticated equipment to mine and extract the gold, causing the majority of diggers to move away in the late 1890s and leading to a decline in the gold mining industry. This also led to an early demise for the Stock Exchange that stood empty for many years, were converted to a cinema in 1912 and finally being demolished in 1958. The amalgamation process used to extract the gold from the crushed ore was relatively inefficient and largely contributed to decline. By 1893 the new MacArthur–Forrest process used for gold extraction brought a short-lived revival in the Klerksdorp gold mining industry, but uncertainty created by the Jameson Raid of December 1895 as well as transport problems created by the rinderpest of 1896 soon led to a near collapse of the industry.

===Second Boer War (1899–1902)===
During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), heavy fighting occurred in the area, which also housed two large concentration camps, one for Whites (centred on modern day Klerksdorp High School) and a separate one for Africans (situated in the area that is today the Ellaton and Neserhof suburbs).

The most famous of the battles around Klerksdorp, is that of the Battle of Ysterspruit (&quot;Iron Stream&quot;), in which the Boer general Koos de la Rey achieved a great victory. The battle is one of the most celebrated of the general&#x27;s career, being the battle in which the Boer soldiers pioneered the art of firing from horseback. On April 11, 1902, Rooiwal, near Klerksdorp, saw the Battle of Rooiwal, the last major engagement of the war, where a Boer charge was beaten off by entrenched British troops.
The graves of the victims of both the concentration camps can still be visited today in the Old Cemetery Complex just outside town, numbering just below a thousand.

===Desmond Tutu and Boer heritage===
Today Klerksdorp is celebrated as the birthplace of Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Mpilo Tutu on October 7, 1931. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his work towards &quot;a democratic and just society without racial divisions&quot;. The life work of Desmond Tutu has been to heal the scars left among the descendants of the many battles for control of South Africa. There is an irony of his birthplace set amidst Boer monuments and old battlefields, early settlements by those same Boers, among them famous leaders like Jacob de Clerq, even close to Witwatersrand where gold was discovered. He somehow managed to rise beyond pettiness and division to bring all these forces together with displaced native peoples in places such as this creating an international role model. He was later awarded multiple worldwide honours for his achievements in the reconciliation of the ethnic and cultural divisions in the history of his country.

===Economic revival since 1932===
The gold mining industry was revived by large mining companies in 1932 during the Free State Gold Rush, causing the town to undergo an economic revival, which accelerated after World War II.

===Newspaper===
The first local newspaper, &quot;The Klerksdorp Pioneer&quot; was published in 1887. In November 1888 it was replaced by George Vickers&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Representative&quot;. This in turn was replaced by H.M Guest&#x27;s &quot;Klerksdorp Mining Record&quot; in August 1899. It still exist as the &quot;Klerksdorp Record&quot;.

==Economy==
===Economic History===
In 1865, twenty-eight years after Klerksdorp had been founded, James Taylor opened the doors of the dofF&#x27;s first trading store. During 1871 he was joined in a partnership by Thomas Smith Leask, a retired elephant-hunter and trader. The store, known as &quot;Taylor and Leask&quot;, was the only one at Klerksdorp and became the centre of the town&#x27;s activities and the rendezvous of hunters and traders who brought ivory and skins from the &quot;interior&quot; (Matebeleland and Mashonaland) and refitted for their next expedition. Both Taylor and Leask were on friendly terms with the majority of the hunters and F .C. Selous, a prolific letter-writer, visited the town several times. In one of his letters he mentioned that it had cost him £1 600 to outfit at the Klerksdorp store. When Taylor died of fever in 1878, Thomas Leask bought out Mrs Taylor and re-established the firm on his own account, as &quot;Thomas Leask and Co.

===Mining===
The introduction in April 1890 of a new gold recovery process by Mr John S. McArthur and Dr Forrest (known as the McArthur Forrest Cyanide Process, and mentioned earlier) made it possible to recover most of the gold contents which had hitherto been lost. This process signalled a new era of prosperity and brought about a revival, since advantage was taken of the newly-discovered methods and cyanide plants were built on several local mines.

Though the depression in the town was bad, several mines continued in production, and, coupled with agriculture, the slump was survived. Subsequent periods of depression and slumps have since hit the Klerksdorp district, but they have been mild in comparison with the dreadful experiences of 1889 and 1890. During December 1892 Thomas Leask, Managing Director of the Nooitgedacht mine, brought a glimmer of hope to some 200 people whom he addressed at the mine. He told the crowd that one thousand ounces of gold had been extracted. His daughter Lulu started the engine of the newly-installed five-stamp battery. The conventional bottle of champagne was broken and refreshments were served.

After several mines had installed the new cyanide process, the gold output, which was merely about 7 000 ounces in 1890, increasesd to 10 967 in 1892 and 12 780 in 1893. By the end of 1895 there were 25 companies in existence and the gold output soared to a phenomenal 71 776 ounces -it now appeared as if the gold industry in Klerksdorp was firmly established and the depression of the late eighties was finally shaken off.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Klerksdorp has a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with warm to hot summers and cool, dry winters. The average annual precipitation is , with most rainfall occurring mainly during summer.

===Suburbs===
Klerksdorp is divided into 35 suburbs

List of suburbs
===Jouberton===
Klerksdorp&#x27;s black residential area was laid out in 1907 south of the town where the residential areas of Neserhof and Ellaton are today. Already in 1924, there was talk of moving the blacks, but it was decided to let it stand until the financial problems associated with such a move were resolved.

In 1935 and 1936, the city council once again decided to move them, but this was not carried out either.

With a view to the southward expansion of the town, the then city council was finally obliged to undertake the relocation. In 1949, construction began on the first 32 houses in the new black residential area, Jouberton. Originally it would be the name Joubertina, named after councilor Jan Joubert. Because there was already a town with this name in the Cape Province (now Eastern Cape), it was changed to Jouberton to avoid confusion.

===Alabama===
The Colored people first lived in an area adjacent to the old industrial area, but in 1956 the surveying of Alabama, the new residential area, began. Two years later, in 1958, the layout of the residential area began.

===Klerksdorp district===
The greater city area surrounding Klerksdorp incorporates the towns of Orkney, Kanana, Stilfontein, Khuma, Hartbeesfontein and Tigane, giving it a population of more than 350,000 inhabitants. 

Due to their geographical location and interconnectedness, there has been talk of amalgamation between Klerksdorp, Stilfontein and Orkney since 1975 and in 1979 a commission of inquiry into the matter was established. However, both Stilfontein and Orkney&#x27;s city council rejected the idea of amalgamation in 1980.

==Modern Klerksdorp==

===Modern Economy===
All of the South African major banks like FNB, ABSA, Standard Bank, Nedbank and Capitec Bank have branches in the city.

Together with Rustenburg, Klerksdorp forms the economic heart of North West Province. It is one of the hubs of the South African gold mining industry, although its importance has been decreasing in recent years. A major earthquake in March 2005 caused significant damage to the eastern suburb of Stilfontein and caused widespread damage to mining activities. It is expected to be a large uranium producer in the future.

Apart from mining, Klerksdorp is positioned as a notable medical, retail and educational centre for North West Province and Northern Free State.

The Klerksdorp district is a major contributor to South African agriculture; maize, sorghum, groundnuts and sunflower are important crops farmed in the district. Klerksdorp has the largest agricultural co-op in the southern hemisphere, named &#x27;Senwes&#x27;.

The farming district is also known for its Sussex cattle herds - the city is the headquarters of the South African Sussex Cattle Breeders Association.

Several national departments and agencies have branches offices in the city (SARS and the Department of Home Affairs)

===Education===
In the city, there are numerous schools catered to primary and secondary schooling, as well as public and private.

The private schools for example are Klerksdorp Christian Academy, Curro Castle Klerksdorp, Methodist Primary School, Kingston Primary School, and Ashton John&#x27;s School.

The public schools consist of Klerksdorp Primary School, Hoërskool Klerksdorp, Technical High School, Hoërskool Schoonspruit, Goudkop Primary School, Milner High School, Wesvalia High School, Laerskool La Hoff, Janie Schneider School, Laerskool Saamtrek, Manzilpark Primary School, Laerskool Meiringspark, Keurhof School, and New Vision Secondary School.

===Diplomatic Missions===
The following countries have consulates in the city

==Transport==
===Airport===
P.C Pelser Airport is a medium-sized airport in South Africa, serving the region of Klerksdorp. The airport is mostly used by private local residents.

For scheduled international and domestic air services, Klerksdorp is currently served by O.R Tambo International Airport.

===Roads===
The N12 is the major freeway that runs through Klerksdorp. Klerksdorp is also served by many regional roads. The R30 Road begins 16 kilometres north of Bloemfontein Central as an off-ramp of the N1 Highway (northbound only). From the R502 junction, the R30 continues northwards for 12 kilometres to enter the city as Church Street (Passing through the city centre) and reach an intersection with the N12 Highway as Chris Hani Road. The R503 is a Regional Route in North West that connects Mahikeng with Klerksdorp via Lichtenburg and Coligny. From Hartbeesfontein, the R503 goes south-east for 20 kilometres to enter the city of Klerksdorp and reach its terminus at a T-junction with the N12 National Route in the suburb of Freemanvile (west of the town centre; north of Jouberton.

===Railway===
The first rail connection was that from Krugersdorp in 1897, the station was built by Netherlands–South African Railway Company and officially opened by President Kruger on the 3 August 1897. Just after the Anglo-Boer War, railway lines were extended to other parts of the country.

In 1905 the line was extended to Vierfontein and Kroonstad. In 1906 Veertienstrome line was opened connecting Klerksdorp and Cape Town. In 1928 the link with Hartebeesfontein and Ottosdal followed.

==Infrastructure==
===Electricity===
The South African state-owned power company ESKOM operates several substations in the city. 

After the discovery of gold, the government during the late 1880s and early 1890s was overwhelmed by the request of citizens of the town with electricity or gas. A concession for the supply of electricity was indeed granted to A. Barnard and A.P.J. Cronje.

However, due to the already mentioned slump in the gold mining industry, the further setback with rinderpest and the Second Freedom War, citizens were not fortunate enough to enjoy these luxuries early.

The power station was later enlarged and replaced in 1934 by a new scheme, which was erected at a cost of R65 000. Ten years later, in 1944, the city council decided to no longer operate its own power station and since then the power has been supplied to the Electricity Supply Commission (ESKOM).

<text>The University of Belgrade () is a public research university in Belgrade, Serbia. It is the oldest and largest modern university in Serbia. 

Founded in 1808 as the Belgrade Higher School in revolutionary Serbia, by 1838 it merged with the Kragujevac-based departments into a single university. The university has around 97,700 enrolled students and over 4,800 academic staff members. Since its founding, the university has educated more than 378,000 bachelors, around 25,100 magisters, 29,000 specialists and 14,670 doctors. The university comprises 31 faculties, 12 research institutes, the university library, and 9 university centres. The faculties are organized into four groups: social sciences and humanities; medical sciences; natural sciences and mathematics; and technological sciences.

==History==

===19th century===
The University of Belgrade was established in 1808 as the Belgrade Higher School (; a &quot;Grandes écoles&quot;) by Dositej Obradović, Serbian key figure in the Age of Enlightenment. It was the highest ranking educational institution in Serbia between 1808 and 1905, as the first Higher School (1808–1813), the Belgrade Lyceum ( / Beogradski Licej; 1838–1863), and the second Higher School (1863–1905). It was initially located at the Princess Ljubica&#x27;s Residence building and then moved to another significant site in Belgrade, the Captain Miša’s Mansion, today&#x27;s seat of the university.

The second Higher School (also known as the &quot;Great School&quot; or &quot;Great Academy&quot; of Belgrade) was established as the successor of the Lyceum and was a combination of a classical gymnasium and a college, and as such developed into the University of Belgrade. Under the law, it was defined as a &quot;scientific institute for higher and professional education&quot;. The minister of education had control over this institution and it was managed by the rector (elected by the monarch) and Academic Council.

During its early history it had three departments: Philosophy, Engineering and Law. The Higher School formally became the University of Belgrade through the Law on the University from February 27, 1905. In addition to the Philosophy, Law and Electrical Engineering departments, this law introduced the Orthodox Theology and Medical schools.

In the early 19th century, the studies of law lasted three years and the curriculum included comparative and state (constitutional) law, international law, criminal law and judicial procedure, as well as general subjects. This is how the modern legal education in Serbia emerged in the year 1808. Before enrolling the legal department, it was compulsory to graduate at the philosophy department where the studies lasted two years, so the legal studies lasted a total of five years. Since 1853, the legal education became independent from the studies of philosophy and from 1863 the legal education in Serbia lasted four years.

The lectures were held by professors who had earned their diplomas in Austria, Germany and France (Jovan Sterija Popović, Josif Pančić, Đura Daničić, and others).

During the 1850s, the Philosophy (General) Department developed into a particular college. The University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy is today&#x27;s continuation of this department.

The first academic lecture on electrical engineering in Serbia was held in 1894. Professor Stevan Marković was the first lecturer and founder of the Engineering Department at the Higher School. Only four years later, Professor Marković also established the first Serbian electrical engineering laboratory. Since then, this academic discipline has been studied at the Higher School and the University of Belgrade. The first diplomas in this field were given in 1922.

===20th century===
The University of Belgrade witnessed a massive growth and expansion in the years before the Second World War and especially after the founding of the second Yugoslavia. The first woman graduated from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Law School in 1914.

In the 1960s and 70s, the university developed into a remarkable regional and international educational institution. Many students from other countries were trained there. Up to 40,000 students from Africa alone studied at the University of Belgrade during the existence of the SFR Yugoslavia. In the socialist Yugoslavia, the university was expanded, but it was also exposed to state and ideological influence. It has also been the driving force for the establishment of almost all other universities in today&#x27;s Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and several universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In 1968, its students organized the first mass protest in post-World War II Yugoslavia.

In the early 1990s the quality of university programs deteriorated as a consequence of the political instability in the country and the subsequent wars of Yugoslavia. There was a lack of financial resources and the quality dropped significantly. During the Milošević government in Serbia, the university had to face external political pressure and the lack of academic and administrative autonomy.

In the mid-1990s, the University of Belgrade became an internationally recognized center of the political opposition in Serbia. Massive anti-government protests were staged by the Belgrade students and professors. The university&#x27;s student organizations (especially &quot;Otpor!&quot;) significantly contributed to overthrowing the government.

===21st century===
The university has become a signatory of the Bologna declaration. Being one of Europe&#x27;s largest universities with an enrollment of nearly 90,000 students, the university broadly cooperates with international academic institutions and is involved in countless bilateral and multilateral academic projects.

===Ranking===

The University of Belgrade has found its place amongst the top 300 universities in the world, according to the most recent (2017) ranking carried out by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, better known as the Shanghai List. In the area of mathematics, it is ranked among the top 150 universities in the world.

==Campus==
Having developed with the city in the 19th century, a number of the university buildings are an important part of Belgrade’s architecture and cultural heritage. Former sites include today&#x27;s Museum of Vuk and Dositej and Princess Ljubica&#x27;s Residence buildings, both of them being recognized as Belgrade&#x27;s topmost historic buildings. The historical Subotica Law School (1920-1941) was also a part of the University of Belgrade. Some of the post-World War II facilities were built in the brutalist style. The university has sites throughout the city, with the two major campuses, one next to the Prince Michael Street at Studentski Trg and the other on King Alexandar Boulevard. It has eleven dormitories scattered throughout the city&#x27;s urban neighborhoods for 11,340 students, including one dormitory complex in New Belgrade. Many of the schools have separate buildings at various locations in Belgrade. The university also owns several endowment buildings in the downtown district, most of them being built in the 19th and early 20th century.

The central administrative building, Faculty of Philology and Faculty of Philosophy are located at Studentski Trg. The Faculty of Biology, Faculty of Geography, Faculty of Mathematics, Faculty for Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Physics and Faculty of Chemistry are situated in one building at Studentski Trg as well. The University Library, Law School, Faculty of Architecture, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering are situated at the King Alexandar Boulevard campus.

Other major academic sites include the School of Economics building near the downtown district, the Faculty of Orthodox Theology building at Bogoslovija (Palilula neighborhood), the Teachers’ Training Faculty building in the Savski Venac municipality, the Faculty of Security Studies building in the Vračar neighborhood, and the Faculty for Special Education and Rehabilitation building in the Dorćol neighborhood. The School of Medicine and School of Dental Medicine share a building near the Karađorđev Park, next to several hospitals. Medical teaching facilities, such as the University Hospital Center or Institute of Mental Health are on other locations within the city. The Faculty of Agriculture is situated alongside the Zemun City Park and it operates the Radmilovac experimental farm in Grocka. The Faculty of Political Sciences and Faculty of Organizational Sciences are situated close to each other in the same street of the Voždovac neighborhood.
==Organization and administration==
The University of Belgrade is governed by the 44-member University Senate elected for a three-year term. The senate is composed of the rector, 4 vice-rectors, 31 deans, 4 presidents of the faculty Group Councils and 4 directors of scientific institutes. 8 student-representatives with a one-year term elected by the university&#x27;s Student Parliament participate in the work of the Senate. The rector provides governance and represents the university externally.

The University Council is a 31-member managing body. The university entrusts 21 members, 5 are appointed by the Serbian government and 5 elected by the university&#x27;s Student Parliament.

==Academics==

The Belgrade Law School, established in 1808, is a regional leader in legal education and one of the largest law schools in the Balkans. Its law education prepares students for working in law practice, business, public service and teaching. The Residence of Countess Ljubica as well as Captain Miša&#x27;s Mansion once used to be home to this educational institution when it was within the Belgrade Higher School. Since its founding, it has educated almost 50,000 law graduates, around 1,200 magistri iuris and 830 doctores iuris, as well as hundreds of specialists in various areas. Many Faculty of Law alumni have become recognized experts and scholars in all branches of law, law professors and high ranking government officials.

The Law School&#x27;s historic building, constructed by Serbian architect Petar Bajalović in 1941, comprises about of space. All the law schools established subsequently in Serbia (Subotica, Novi Sad, Pristina, Niš, Kragujevac), Montenegro (Podgorica), and in other parts of the former Yugoslavia (Sarajevo, Skopje) were formed from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law as a core.

Initially established in 1937, the Faculty of Economics was the first centre of higher education dedicated to the study of economics in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Its curriculum includes courses in economic analysis and policy; marketing; accounting, auditing and financial management; trade and commerce; finance, banking and insurance; tourism and hotel industry; statistics and informatics; management and international economics and foreign trade.

The Faculty of Philosophy is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Serbia, founded in the early 19th century. It employs a staff of 255 teachers and has approximately 6,000 undergraduate and graduate students within nine departments.

The Faculty of Philology trains and educates its students in the academic study or practice in linguistics and philology. The study of philology was established in Belgrade within the Belgrade Higher School&#x27;s Department of Philosophy in 1808. Today, the school offers courses in philology, linguistics and literature in dozens of languages. The school is divided into departments, which possess their own libraries, it operates several research centers and publishes a number of periodical publications.
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering is also an important part of the university. The first lecture on electrical engineering was held in 1894. Professor Stevan Marković was the first lecturer and founder of the Engineering Department within the Belgrade Higher School. Marković also established the first Serbian electrical engineering laboratory in 1898. Today, the school is divided into a number of departments, offering a wide range of electrical engineering programs.

The Belgrade Medical School was established in 1920 and more than 30,000 students graduated from this institution, including circa 850 international students. The School of Medicine is composed of 40 departments with over 200 professorships. The school offers an extensive number of academic courses, including specialization practice within a network of hospitals, institutes and medical clinics.

The Faculty of Stomatology (Belgrade Dental School) was established in 1948. The first head of the newly founded faculty was Dr. Aleksandar Djordjevic, Professor of the Faculty of Medicine at that time. In organizing and teaching the students of dentistry after its establishment, and long after, many teachers of the Faculty of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and Faculty of Pharmacy have contributed a lot. The Faculty of Stomatology is composed of 8 teaching and scientific and healthcare organizational units.

Under the umbrella of the humanities faculty, the Faculty of Security Studies has its roots in the Institute for National Defense of the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Faculty, University of Belgrade. In 1978, this institute evolved into the free-standing Faculty of People&#x27;s Defense, which was renamed several times before becoming the Faculty of Security Studies in May 2006.

<doc id="918900" wikidata="Q1071740" url="?curid=918900" title="Loss-of-coolant accident">
<text>A loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) is a mode of failure for a nuclear reactor; if not managed effectively, the results of a LOCA could result in reactor core damage. Each nuclear plant&#x27;s emergency core cooling system (ECCS) exists specifically to deal with a LOCA.

Nuclear reactors generate heat internally; to remove this heat and convert it into useful electrical power, a coolant system is used. If this coolant flow is reduced, or lost altogether, the nuclear reactor&#x27;s emergency shutdown system is designed to stop the fission chain reaction. However, due to radioactive decay, the nuclear fuel will continue to generate a significant amount of heat. The decay heat produced by a reactor shutdown from full power is initially equivalent to about 5 to 6% of the thermal rating of the reactor. 
If all of the independent cooling trains of the ECCS fail to operate as designed, this heat can increase the fuel temperature to the point of damaging the reactor. 
*If water is present, it may boil, bursting out of its pipes. For this reason, nuclear power plants are equipped with pressure-operated relief valves and backup supplies of cooling water.
*If graphite and air are present, the graphite may catch fire, spreading radioactive contamination. This situation exists only in AGRs, RBMKs, Magnox and weapons-production reactors, which use graphite as a neutron moderator (see Chernobyl disaster and Windscale fire).
*The fuel and reactor internals may melt; if the melted configuration remains critical, the molten mass will continue to generate heat, possibly melting its way down through the bottom of the reactor. Such an event is called a nuclear meltdown and can have severe consequences. The so-called &quot;China syndrome&quot; would be this process taken to an extreme: the molten mass working its way down through the soil to the water table (and below) – however, current understanding and experience of nuclear fission reactions suggests that the molten mass would become too disrupted to carry on heat generation before descending very far; for example, in the Chernobyl disaster the reactor core melted and core material was found in the basement, too widely dispersed to carry on a chain reaction (but still dangerously radioactive).
*Some reactor designs have passive safety features that prevent meltdowns from occurring in these extreme circumstances. The Pebble Bed Reactor, for instance, can withstand extreme temperature transients in its fuel. Another example is the CANDU reactor, which has two large masses of relatively cool, low-pressure water (first is the heavy-water moderator; second is the light-water-filled shield tank) that act as heat sinks. Another example is the Hydrogen Moderated Self-regulating Nuclear Power Module, in which the chemical decomposition of the uranium hydride fuel halts the fission reaction by removing the hydrogen moderator. The same principle is used in TRIGA research reactors.

Under operating conditions, a reactor may passively (that is, in the absence of any control systems) increase or decrease its power output in the event of a LOCA or of voids appearing in its coolant system (by water boiling, for example). This is measured by the coolant void coefficient. Most modern nuclear power plants have a negative void coefficient, indicating that as water turns to steam, power instantly decreases. Two exceptions are the Soviet RBMK and the Canadian CANDU. Boiling water reactors, on the other hand, are designed to have steam voids inside the reactor vessel.

Modern reactors are designed to prevent and withstand loss of coolant, regardless of their void coefficient, using various techniques. Some, such as the pebble bed reactor, passively slow down the chain reaction when coolant is lost; others have extensive safety systems to rapidly shut down the chain reaction, and may have extensive passive safety systems (such as a large thermal heat sink around the reactor core, passively-activated backup cooling/condensing systems, or a passively cooled containment structure) that mitigate the risk of further damage.

==Progression after loss-of-coolant==
A great deal of work goes into the prevention of a serious core event. If such an event were to occur, three different physical processes are expected to increase the time between the start of the accident and the time when a large release of radioactivity could occur. These three factors would provide additional time to the plant operators in order to mitigate the result of the event:
#The time required for the water to boil away (coolant, moderator). Assuming that at the moment that the accident occurs the reactor will be SCRAMed (immediate and full insertion of all control rods), so reducing the thermal power input and further delaying the boiling.
#The time required for the fuel to melt. After the water has boiled, then the time required for the fuel to reach its melting point will be dictated by the heat input due to decay of fission products, the heat capacity of the fuel and the melting point of the fuel.
#The time required for the molten fuel to breach the primary pressure boundary. The time required for the molten metal of the core to breach the primary pressure boundary (in light water reactors this is the pressure vessel; in CANDU and RBMK reactors this is the array of pressurized fuel channels; in PHWR reactors like Atucha I, it will be a double barrier of channels and the pressure vessel) will depend on temperatures and boundary materials. Whether or not the fuel remains critical in the conditions inside the damaged core or beyond will play a significant role.

==Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster==

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 occurred due to a loss-of-coolant accident. The circuits that provided electrical power to the coolant pumps failed causing a loss-of-core-cooling that was critical for the removal of residual decay heat which is produced even after active reactors are shut down and nuclear fission has ceased. The loss of reactor core cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, three hydrogen explosions and the release of radioactive contamination.

The hydrogen explosions can be directly attributed to the oxidation of zirconium by steam in the fuel claddings as a result of the loss-of-coolant.

== Fuel claddings ==

Most reactors use a zirconium alloy as the material for fuel rod claddings due to its corrosion-resistance and low neutron absorption cross-section. However, one major drawback of zirconium alloys is that, when overheated, they oxidize and produce a runaway exothermic reaction with water (steam) that leads to the production of hydrogen: &lt;chem&gt;Zr + 2H2O -&gt; ZrO2 + 2H2&lt;/chem&gt;. Such reactions are what led to the hydrogen explosions in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

=== Rupture Behavior ===
The residual decay heat causes rapid increase in temperature and internal pressure of the fuel cladding which leads to plastic deformation and subsequent bursting. During a loss-of-coolant accident, zirconium-based fuel claddings undergo high temperature oxidation, phase transformation, and creep deformation simultaneously. These mechanisms have been extensively studied by researchers using burst criterion models. In one study, researchers developed a burst criterion for Zircaloy-4 fuel claddings and determined that the effect of the steam environment on failure of the claddings is negligible at low temperatures. However, as the burst temperature increases, rapid oxidation of Zircaloy-4 claddings occurs leading to a sharp decrease in its ductility. In fact, at higher temperatures the burst strain pretty much drops to zero signifying that the oxidized cladding becomes so brittle locally that it is predicted to fail without any further deformation or straining.

The amount of oxygen picked up by the zirconium alloy depends on the exposure time to steam (H2O) before rupture. For rapid ruptures due to high heating rates and internal pressures, there is negligible oxidation. However, oxidation plays an important role in fracture for low heating rates and low initial internal pressures.

=== Oxidation Resistance Coatings ===
The zirconium alloy substrates can be coated to improve their oxidation resistance. In one study, researchers coated a Zirlo substrate with Ti2AlC MAX phase using a hybrid arc/magnetron sputtering technique followed by an annealing treatment. They subsequently investigated the mechanical properties and oxidation resistance in pure steam conditions at 1000 °C, 1100 °C, and 1200 °C under different oxidation times. Results showed that coating the Zirlo substrate with Ti2AlC caused in increase in hardness and elastic modulus compared to the bare substrate. Additionally, the high-temperature oxidation resistance was significantly improved. The benefits of Ti2AlC over other coating materials are that it has excellent stability under neutron irradiation, a lower thermal expansion coefficient, better thermal shock resistance, and higher temperature oxidation resistance. &quot;Table 1&quot; provides a good indication of the improved mechanical properties as a result of the coating and improved resistance to plastic deformation.

Another recent study evaluated Cr and FeCrAl coatings (deposited on Zircaloy-4 using atmospheric plasma spraying technology) under simulated loss-of-coolant conditions. The Cr coating displayed superior oxidation resistance. The formation of a compact Cr2O3 layer on the Cr-coating acted as an oxygen diffusion barrier that protected the Zr substrate from oxidation whereas the FeCrAl coating degraded due to inter-diffusion between the coating and the Zr substrate at high temperature thereby allowing Zr to still oxidize.

<text>By the Way is the eighth studio album by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released July 9, 2002, on Warner Bros. Records. It sold more than 286,000 copies in its first week, and peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Singles included &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Dosed&quot; was released as a promotional single in the US and Canada. The lyrical subject matter vocalist Anthony Kiedis addresses in &quot;By the Way&quot; is a divergence from previous Red Hot Chili Peppers albums, with Kiedis taking a more candid and reflective approach to his lyrics.

&quot;By the Way&quot; was lauded by critics as a departure from the band&#x27;s previous styles, and is recognized for the melodic and subdued emotions given by the Chili Peppers. Guitarist John Frusciante is credited with writing most of the album&#x27;s melodies, backing vocal arrangements, bass lines, and guitar progressions, therefore changing the direction of the recording dramatically: &quot;his warm, understated guitar work and his doo-wop style vocal harmonies are king this time around.&quot; &quot;By the Way&quot; contained very little of the signature funk-metal fusion the band had become known for playing. Frusciante has stated that writing &quot;&quot;By the Way&quot; [was] one of the happiest times in my life.&quot; The album went on to sell more than eight million copies worldwide. The album has come to be regarded by many as one of the band&#x27;s finest works.

== Background ==
The writing and formation of &quot;By the Way&quot; began immediately following the culmination of &quot;Californication&#x27;s&quot; world tour, in the spring of 2001. As with &quot;Californication&quot;, much of the creation took place in the band members&#x27; homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: &quot;We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.&quot; Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, &quot;writing &quot;By the Way&quot;... was a whole different experience from &quot;Californication&quot;. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.&quot; Prior to recording &quot;By the Way&quot;, the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the band creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.

== Writing and composition ==
According to the 2010 book, &quot;An Oral/Visual History by the Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;, Frusciante had originally intended for the album to be very different from how it was eventually completed. Frusciante wanted an album of two different types of songs: songs that were more &quot;English-sounding&quot; and melodic, and songs that were more influenced by punk rock. Frusciante&#x27;s punk inspiration came from listening to music by The Damned and Discharge, among others. Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material. However, one punk rock-influenced song was recorded during these sessions, &quot;Body of Water&quot;, but did not make the final cut and was instead included on &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot; single. Many of the more melodic inspired songs came from Frusciante listening to The Beach Boys and The Beatles, along with doo-wop groups and their harmonies. Frusciante said he listened to Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer every day during the recording of &quot;By the Way&quot;. These new styles as well as Frusciante being especially prolific during this era came to alienate bassist Flea, who had wanted the band to return to its earlier funk-influenced sound. Frusciante felt the band had already thoroughly explored funk and was more interested in creating something new for the band. According to Kiedis, Flea felt his voice wasn&#x27;t being heard, and there was a point where he considered leaving the band. While speaking to Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, Frusciante mentioned that he listened to guitarists such as John McGeoch for his work on the Magazine&#x27;s and Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; albums including &quot;Juju&quot;, Adrian Fisher of Sparks for &quot;Kimono My House&quot;, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column and Keith Levene of Public Image Limited. He also credits XTC singer/guitarist Andy Partridge in the 2002 issue of &quot;Total Guitar&quot; for being an influence on his guitar work for the album.

The album&#x27;s guitar and bass ensemble was primarily dictated by Frusciante, rather than a collaborative effort between him and Flea. Therefore, the record took a different direction than any previous Chili Peppers&#x27; album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Reilly and McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on &quot;By the Way&quot;, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band&#x27;s subsequent studio album, &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;, Flea reflected on the composition of &quot;By the Way&quot;, stating: &quot;John went to this whole level of artistry. But he made me feel like I had nothing to offer, like I knew shit.&quot;
Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;I Could Die for You&quot;, &quot;Dosed&quot;, &quot;Warm Tape&quot; and non-album tracks &quot;Someone&quot; and &quot;Body of Water&quot; all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis&#x27; writings, as he&#x27;d only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like &quot;This Is the Place&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&quot; expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him, and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug addiction). He referenced the late Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, who died of a heroin overdose in 1988, in &quot;This Is the Place&quot;, and describes how he was so intoxicated at the time that he missed Slovak&#x27;s funeral: &quot;On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.&quot; &quot;Venice Queen&quot; was written as an ode to Kiedis&#x27; drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California&#x27;s Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: &quot;We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

&quot;By the Way&quot; diverged from the band&#x27;s previous styles, containing a few funk-driven songs. &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and the title track were the only songs that revisited their once trademark style of short, rapped verses. &quot;Throw Away Your Television&quot;, while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other &quot;experimental&quot; tracks include the melodica-based &quot;On Mercury&quot;. &quot;Cabron&quot;, the only track to be played entirely acoustic, has distinctive Latin influences. Frusciante has stated that the guitar parts for Cabron were influenced by Martin Barre&#x27;s playing on Jethro Tull&#x27;s album Aqualung, with Anthony and Chad&#x27;s parts contributing to the Latin, or Mexican, influence. &quot;Tear&quot; and &quot;Warm Tape&quot; were keyboard based more so than guitar or bass, the latter being completely written on the instrument. Technically, &quot;By the Way&quot; saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers employing several devices to distort and alter guitar and vocal sequences. &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&quot; utilizes a mellotron, wah pedal, and echoing techniques to convey an emotive atmosphere, while Frusciante uses a Big Muff for the solos on &quot;Minor Thing&quot;.

=== Outtakes ===
Many outtakes from the album have been released or exist. &quot;Time&quot; and a cover version of Dion and the Belmonts&#x27; &quot;Teenager in Love&quot; were released on the single &quot;By the Way&quot;. &quot;Body of Water&quot;, &quot;Out of Range&quot;, &quot;Someone&quot; and &quot;Rivers of Avalon&quot; were all released on the single &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;. &quot;Slowly Deeply&quot;, which was featured on the single &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;, is an outtake from the &quot;Californication&quot; sessions. The single for &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; also features an alternate mix of the song with higher harmonies and a clearer bass line. A cover version of the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Havana Affair&quot; was also recorded and later released in 2003 on &quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family: A Tribute to Ramones&quot;. In 2003, the band re-entered the studio to work on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. &quot;Fortune Faded&quot;, a song first performed live in 2001, was originally recorded and intended for &quot;By the Way&quot; however this version of the song was never officially released. The song was re-recorded with a different chorus and was released as a single to promote the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album and featured the B-side, &quot;Eskimo&quot;, another &quot;By the Way&quot; outtake. The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; sessions also produced enough songs for a new album, many of which have gone unreleased though some of the rough mixes have leaked to the internet. &quot;Bicycle Song&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; were officially released from those sessions in 2006 as bonus tracks on the iTunes release of &quot;By the Way&quot; even though neither song was originally recorded for the album.

In August 2014, unreleased tracks from the album&#x27;s recording sessions were leaked to the Internet. Many of the album&#x27;s released songs and outtakes are in their earliest forms and feature improvised lyrics by Kiedis. The leak included three songs never heard before, including &quot;Goldmine&quot;, &quot;Fall Water&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, along with the original version of &quot;Fortune Faded&quot;. Many of the songs on &quot;By the Way&quot; also had different working titles (which prior to release were also mentioned in various interviews): Soul Train (&quot;By the Way&quot;), Coltraine (&quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;), Choppy Funk (&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;), I Would Die, The Most Beautiful Chords Ever (&quot;I Could Die For You&quot;), Wolverine, Drone (&quot;This is the Place&quot;), A Minor One (&quot;Minor Thing&quot;) Television, Trash Your Television and Throw Away (&quot;Throw Away Your Television&quot;), Don&#x27;t Forget (&quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&quot;), Lemon Trees on Mercury (&quot;On Mercury&quot;), The Loop Song (&quot;Dosed&quot;), Epic, Gloria&#x27;s Epic (&quot;Venice Queen&quot;) and New Wave (&quot;Rivers Of Avalon&quot;). To date, &quot;Strumming in Don J&quot;, a song assumed to be an instrumental jam and that Frusciante mentioned during pre-album release interviews, has never been released. &quot;Upseen&quot;, another instrumental jam which was said to be 10 minutes long, has also never been released however it is speculated that this song could also have been another title for &quot;Strumming in Don J&quot;.

== Artwork ==
All paintings, photography and art direction is credited to Julian Schnabel and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The woman featured on the cover of &quot;By the Way&quot; is Stella Schnabel, Julian Schnabel&#x27;s daughter and Frusciante&#x27;s then-girlfriend. Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: &quot;My girlfriend&#x27;s father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn&#x27;t be offended if we didn&#x27;t like it, but we loved what he did. He&#x27;s also given us great covers for all the singles. He&#x27;s a true artist.&quot;

Several pages of the album&#x27;s booklet, and single for &quot;By the Way&quot; contain paintings of a goat head. A somewhat blurry, black and white photograph of the band in a desolate field, and each band member individually, is also present.

The majority of the booklet&#x27;s artwork are various scenes of replica grass and plants, stars and indistinguishable objects, which appears to be a miniature pole, placed in dirt. Single covers for &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; both feature this same background, although angled slightly differently. The lyrics for &quot;By the Way&quot; are placed on top of the landscape, hand written by Kiedis in pink lettering.

== Release ==
Feeling extremely confident in the album, the Red Hot Chili Peppers issued the statement, &quot;Greetings from the dimensions of invisible shapes and colors. The music on this record has expanded our space and made us bigger. Thank you for listening and being exactly where and who you are.&quot; Drummer Chad Smith commented that &quot;By the Way&quot; is &quot;very honest, raw, emotional music. It&#x27;s a very dynamic, rich and lush album. Probably the best collection of Chili Peppers songs we&#x27;ve ever put out.&quot; Warner Bros. Records promoted the album heavily in the months prior to the record&#x27;s 2002 release, especially targeting the online market in order to steer customers away from illegal downloads. The record label implemented a campaign they colloquially titled &quot;A Song a Day&quot;. This program, initiated on June 21, was aimed at leaking one song per day until the album was released. Over 150 radio stations participated in broadcasting the band&#x27;s new daily material, along with MTV, VH1, and digital music retailers like iTunes, as well as cell phone companies. AOL featured the Chili Peppers as their &quot;Artist of the Month&quot; in June, streaming interviews and live performances of the band free of charge; they also sold an MP3 of &quot;By the Way&quot;, the record&#x27;s first single, for ninety-nine cents and raffled off tickets that gave fans a chance to see the band in Japan in November.

&quot;By the Way&quot; was released on CD and LP on July 9, 2002, under the Warner Bros. label, selling 281,948 copies in the United States in its first week and 1.8 million worldwide. It was certified gold just a few months later on October 26, 2002. Five singles were released from the album; of these, the title track was the most successful, peaking at No.2 on the UK charts and No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts. Although the album sold fewer copies than &quot;Californication&quot;, &quot;By the Way&quot; managed to peak at No.2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, one spot higher than &quot;Californication&quot;. Around the world, the album debuted at number one in the UK, Switzerland, New Zealand, Austria, and Sweden; and number two in France. In March 2006, all Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; albums were made available for download from the iTunes Music Store and other online retailers. The iTunes release contained two bonus tracks that didn&#x27;t appear on the original album.

== Critical reception ==

The album received a positive reaction from critics, who praised &quot;By the Way&quot; for its melodic, multilayer and textured styles. AllMusic&#x27;s Zac Johnson said that the album was &quot;sophisticated... the Peppers have not sacrificed any of their trademark energy or passions for life, universal love, and (of course) lust&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;insanely melodic&quot; and a &quot;near-perfect balance of gutter grime and high-art aspiration&quot;, comparing it to other works, such as the Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; applauded the recording, and considered it to be &quot;the strongest Chili&#x27;s album since 1991&#x27;s &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;&quot;. Giving the album 5stars out of 5, &quot;Q&quot; called &quot;By the Way&quot; &quot;A fantastic record; full of wonder.&quot; Kimberly Mack of &quot;PopMatters&quot; commented on how the album &quot;...showcases a more sophisticated, lush sound that only today&#x27;s Peppers could have conceived&quot;, and that &quot;Anthony Kiedis&#x27; lyrics are more personal than ever.&quot; Frusciante was, in his eyes, &quot;a musical talent to be reckoned with and is the undeniable X factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; sound.&quot;

However, the praise was balanced by certain critics. &quot;Blender&quot; considered &quot;By the Way&quot; to be an indistinguishable sequel to &quot;Californication&quot;, calling it &quot;Californication 2&quot;. It further criticized the Chili Peppers for not varying their style and remaining extremely similar in sound. Jaime Lowe of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; panned Kiedis&#x27; lyrics as &quot;absolutely baffling&quot; and commented that &quot;it&#x27;s as if he picked up a rhyming dictionary and arbitrarily strung some phrases together.&quot; The newspaper&#x27;s Robert Christgau was also critical of Kiedis&#x27; songwriting, writing that &quot;it&#x27;s not enough for Anthony Kiedis to get all mature—he&#x27;s supposed to say something interesting about maturity.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised &quot;By the Way&quot; for being well refined and a superb collaboration, but criticized the Chili Peppers for playing it safe and keeping the album&#x27;s energy mild; for being &quot;more fascinating for what it symbolizes than what it is.&quot;

AllMusic considered the song &quot;By the Way&quot; to combine &quot;fiery Hollywood funk, gentle harmonies, a little bit of singing about girls, [and] a little bit of hanging out in the streets in the summertime.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented on &quot;how close this band has come to conjuring pure California sunshine&quot; in &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;. &quot;Midnight&quot; was highly regarded by several sources. It was chosen as one of &quot;By the Way&quot;″s &quot;Allmusic Track Picks&quot;. Kimberly Mack of &quot;PopMatters&quot; considered it to have &quot;hippie-friendly lyrics&quot; and to &quot;evoke images of tie-dyed T-shirts and AM radio.&quot; Mack also regarded &quot;Venice Queen&quot; as &quot;a masterpiece... Frusciante&#x27;s backing vocals are hauntingly beautiful.&quot; In 2005, &quot;By the Way&quot; was ranked number 375 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. It has been cited as one of the band&#x27;s best works.

Flea decided that he would finish the album and then quit the band. He was still upset over disputes with Frusciante, who he thought was trying to take over the band. According to Smith, Flea and Frusciante eventually had a sit-down meeting with each other to air out their differences. Frusciante had no idea how Flea was feeling and had no intentions of taking over. Flea also credited practicing Vipassanā meditation along with Frusciante for helping the two repair their musical relationship. With their problems worked out, the band launched their promo tour to support the album on New York City&#x27;s Ellis Island. Sponsored by the rock radio station K-Rock, the event was titled the &quot;Pep Rally&quot;. The band performed eight songs from &quot;By the Way&quot;, as well as tracks from &quot;Californication&quot; and &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; in front of 900 contest winners. The &quot;New York Post&quot; declared the show &quot;one of the top concerts of the year.&quot; The location was chosen in order to reinvigorate lower Manhattan after the September 11 attacks and all proceeds were donated to pertinent charity organizations. Immediately following this, the Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on a world tour to support the album. Beginning in Europe, they also played at events such as the Fuji Rock Festival and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in between. The band eventually culminated their Europe leg of the tour in February 2003, and commenced the United States leg on May 1. The Red Hot Chili Peppers played at Madison Square Garden in New York City on May 20, 2003, to a sold-out crowd and an enthusiastic response from critics. Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;on Tuesday night, the [Red Hot Chili Peppers] came to Madison Square Garden for an extraordinary two-hour performance... On &#x27;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&#x27;, [Flea] strummed chords, while Mr. Frusciante contributed a gorgeous guitar line that bubbled and hissed like some sort of chemical reaction.&quot; The US leg ended on June 21; the band took a small hiatus before performing at Slane Castle in Ireland on August 23, to a crowd of over 80,000. &quot;Live at Slane Castle&quot;, the result of the concert, would become the Chili Peppers&#x27; second live DVD, after &quot;Off the Map&quot;.

Following several Japanese and Australian performances, the Red Hot Chili Peppers planned three nights at London&#x27;s Hyde Park. Over 240,000 tickets were sold within hours, with roughly 80,000 people attending each show on June 19, 20, and 25, respectively. It became the highest-grossing concert at a single venue in history, accumulating an estimated $17 million gross revenue. Due to the success of the three shows, the band released their first live album, &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers Live in Hyde Park&quot;, in Europe, Australia, Japan and New Zealand, excluding the United States. Later that year, the band played for the 2004 Democratic National Convention.

In 2006, Flea revealed that he once again considered leaving the band while touring in support of the album, stating that &quot;throughout the &quot;By the Way&quot; tour I would play a show and then go and sit on the end of my bed staring into space.&quot; He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain with the band. Flea later stated that &quot;the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that stopped me, was the idea of telling Anthony.&quot;

<text>Jewel Cave National Monument contains Jewel Cave, currently the fifth longest cave in the world and second longest cave in the United States, with of mapped passageways as of May 2024. It is located approximately west of the town of Custer in Black Hills of South Dakota. It became a national monument in 1908.

==History==
Frank and Albert Michaud, two local prospectors, discovered the cave in 1900, when they felt cold air blowing out of a small hole in a canyon. It is unknown whether any previous inhabitants of the area were aware of the natural cave opening, which was not large enough for a person to enter.

After enlarging the cave entrance with dynamite, the Michaud brothers found a cavern lined with calcite crystals, which led them to name it &quot;Jewel Cave&quot;. The brothers tried to capitalize on the discovery, widening the opening, building walkways inside, and opening it to tourists. Although their venture was unsuccessful, news of the discovery eventually reached Washington. President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Jewel Cave a National Monument on February 7, 1908. The area around the natural entrance to the cave was further developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The National Park Service assumed management of the monument in 1933 and began offering tours in 1939.

As recently as 1959, less than of passageway had been discovered. That year, however, Herb and Jan Conn, local rock climbers, began exploring, and within two years had mapped . Much of the new discoveries lay outside the boundaries of the monument, under land managed by the United States Forest Service. The two agencies performed a land swap in 1965, establishing the present boundaries of the park, and enabling the development of a new part of the cave. The Park Service sunk a elevator shaft to a previously remote cave area, and built concrete walks and metal stairs and platforms along a one-half-mile loop. The &quot;Scenic Tour&quot; was opened in 1972. Most modern-day visitors tour that part of the cave. 
In August 2000, an forest fire burned 90% of the monument and the surrounding area. The visitor center and historic buildings were spared.

==Exploration==
By 1979, Herb and Jan Conn had discovered, named, and mapped more than of passages. Although they largely retired from caving by the early 1980s, exploration has continued unabated. Because the areas being explored take many hours to reach, explorers now sometimes camp in the cave during expeditions of as long as four days. The cave is mapped by traditional survey techniques, using compass, clinometer and today with lasers instead of tape measures.

Its near of mapped passageway make Jewel Cave the fifth longest cave in the world, after the Mammoth Cave System in Kentucky, Ox Bel Ha, Sac Actun, both in the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico) and Shuanghedong Cave Network in China.

The discovered areas in the cave account for only about 3–5% of the estimated total air volume of the cave, which is believed to be roughly 8 billion cubic feet (230 million cubic meters). This puts estimates for the total length somewhere between roughly and . The cave volume is estimated by measuring the amount of air that the cave &quot;exhales&quot; when the outside air pressure drops and &quot;inhales&quot; when the outside air pressure rises.

==Geology==

Jewel Cave is a &quot;breathing cave,&quot; which means air enters or exits the cave with changes in atmospheric pressure from day to night or due to changes in the weather. This was first explained by Herb Conn in 1966.

Most of the cave formed within the Mississippian Pahasapa Limestone deposited 350 million years ago. The later limestones, sandstones, and shales deposited in these Paleozoic and Mesozoic seas were eroded with the geologic uplift associated with Laramide Orogeny and the formation of the Black Hills. The main passages of the cave then formed in the early Cenozoic. Uplift continued in the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene lowering the water table and draining the cave.

Jewel Cave passages follow a pattern of joint development. The faults and joints are associated with the uplift of the Black Hills approximately 58 to 54 million years ago. After main cave dissolution, a thick layer of calcite lined the walls about 2.5 million years ago.

During cave development and afterwards, speleothems and speleogens formed, including the &quot;jewels&quot; or spar. Other examples include stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, cave popcorn, boxworks, helictites, scintillites, conulites, coralloids, cave pearls, rimstone, rafts, rims, vents, and frostwork. The gypsum formations include needles, beards, cotton, hair, flowers, and spiders. Finally, Jewel Cave contains a very rare formation called a hydromagnesite balloon. Those are created when gas of an unknown source inflates a pasty substance formed by the precipitation of the magnesium carbonate hydroxide mineral.

Jewel Cave is located less than 20 miles from Wind Cave National Park, though the caves are not believed to be connected.
==Access==
Jewel Cave is open year-round. The Park Service offers three tours: the scenic tour, a half-mile loop through a paved and lighted central portion of the cave accessible by elevator; the historic tour, a candlelight tour through the earliest-discovered part of the cave; and a wild caving tour, through an undeveloped part of the cave near the scenic loop. There are 3 surface trails varying in length and difficulty.

<text>Mount Anville Secondary School is a Roman Catholic, voluntary all-girls post-primary school in Goatstown, a suburb of Dublin, in Ireland. It was originally an all-boarding school, but due to decreased demand for such schools has since become a day school. It has approximately 659 students, and is attached to Mount Anville Montessori Junior School and Mount Anville Convent.

It was established in 1853 by nuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart in the former home of William Dargan, an influential railway tycoon.

In 1967, the community and school of the Sacred Heart at 18 Lower Leeson Street were subsumed by the school which had earlier moved from Harcourt Street in 1879.

Mount Anville was once situated in north Dublin.

==Grounds==
The school has its own chapel, featuring a stained-glass window by Irish artist Harry Clarke. The school also has sporting facilities, including a large sports hall, three astroturf playing pitches and tennis courts.

<doc id="918924" wikidata="Q141852" url="?curid=918924" title="New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>New Zealand competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s twenty-second appearance at the Olympics since its debut in 1908 as part of Australasia. The New Zealand Olympic Committee sent a total of 148 athletes, 81 men, and 67 women to the Games to compete in 18 sports, surpassing a single athlete short of the record from Sydney four years earlier. Basketball and field hockey were the only team-based sports in which New Zealand had its representation at these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in archery, boxing, and fencing.

Thirty-four athletes from the New Zealand team had previously competed in Sydney, including Olympic bronze medallist Barbara Kendall in women&#x27;s Mistral windsurfing, equestrian eventing rider Blyth Tait, sprint kayaker and former breaststroke swimmer Steven Ferguson, table tennis sisters Chunli and Karen Li, and discus thrower Beatrice Faumuina, who was appointed by the committee to carry the New Zealand flag in the opening ceremony. Tait&#x27;s compatriot Andrew Nicholson participated in his fifth Olympic appearance since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (except 2000, in which he was not chosen), as the most experienced athlete. While Tait shared the same age with Nicholson at 43, and served as the oldest member of the team by a month difference, breaststroke swimmer Annabelle Carey, aged 15, was the youngest ever New Zealand athlete to compete at the Olympics since 1976.

New Zealand left Athens with a total of five Olympic medals, three golds and two silver, finishing twenty-fourth in the overall medal count. Four New Zealand athletes won Olympic gold medals: Hamish Carter in men&#x27;s triathlon, 
track cyclist Sarah Ulmer in women&#x27;s individual pursuit, and twin sisters and rowers Caroline and Georgina Evers-Swindell in women&#x27;s double sculls.

<text>Royal Bank Plaza is a skyscraper in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that has served as the corporate headquarters for the Royal Bank of Canada since 1976. The building shares with the Fairmont Royal York Hotel the block in Toronto&#x27;s financial district bordered by Bay, Front, York, and Wellington streets. It is owned by Pontegadea.

==History==
The building was built to be the new main office of the Royal Bank of Canada after its decision to move its centre of operations from Place Ville Marie in Montreal to Toronto in the late 1970s, although Place Ville Marie remains the bank&#x27;s head office (a distinct title from its corporate headquarters). Royal Bank Plaza consists of a South Tower and a North Tower. The South Tower, a skyscraper, is the taller of the two at ; the North Tower has a height of . The structures each have a triangular footprint and sit on opposing corners of the square site. The exteriors of the structures are largely covered with gold-bronze glass with tan granite accents. Together, both towers contain more than 14,000 windows which project from the facade to form angular bays set into brushed aluminum frames. Six bays are grouped between piers which are covered in the same glass. The upper stories are recessed and contain three larger angled-bays between the piers. The double-height entry is also recessed from the facade and covered in dark-tinted glass set into dark aluminum frames. The glass for the body of the building was manufactured by Canadian Pittsburgh Industries and was coloured using of gold, valued at CA$70 per pane at the time of installation.

In addition to office space and the Toronto Main Branch of the Royal Bank, Royal Bank Plaza also contains a shopping concourse which is part of the PATH network, linking directly to the TD Centre as well as Union Station, Brookfield Place (BCE Place) and the Fairmont Royal York. The concourse merchants mall and tower lobbies underwent extensive renovations between 2005 and 2007.

The building was constructed with a large atrium above the main banking hall that linked the two towers, but in the 1990s a trading floor was added, closing the open space.

The bank maintains a presence in a number of other towers in the downtown core, including the Royal Bank Building at 20 King Street West adjacent to Scotia Plaza, the RBC Centre at 155 Wellington Street West, and the building complex at 310, 315, 320 and 330 Front Street West, next to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, which is also owned by Oxford.

<text>The SR-50 was Texas Instruments&#x27; first scientific pocket calculator with trigonometric and logarithm functions. It enhanced their earlier SR-10 and SR-11 calculators, introduced in 1973, which had featured scientific notation, squares, square root, and reciprocals, but had no trig or log functions, and lacked other features. The SR-50 was introduced in 1974 and sold for US$170. It competed with the Hewlett-Packard HP-35.

==Design==
The SR-50 measured 5-3/4 inches long by 3-1/8 inches wide by 1-3/16 inches high (147 mm by 78 mm by 31 mm) and was powered by a rechargeable NiCad battery pack, built from three welded AA cells. It had 40 keys, and flat sliding switches for degrees/radians and on/off. &quot;SR&quot; stood for &quot;slide rule.&quot;

The SR-50 had a red LED display with a signed ten-digit mantissa plus a signed two-digit exponent for floating point numbers (negative values were indicated with a leading minus sign and positive values with no sign). Internally, calculations were performed with a 13-digit mantissa, providing much greater calculation accuracy than the 10-digit precision of most scientific calculators of the time. After the leading sign, digits consisted of a seven-segment display plus decimal point. A blinking display indicated an error, such as a calculation error or an overflow or underflow condition. 

Like most scientific calculators, the SR-50 mostly used ordinary infix notation, as opposed to the postfix Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) employed by its main competitor, the Hewlett Packard HP-35. The SR-50 followed the standard order of operations by performing unary (single-argument) operations (reciprocal, square, square root, log, trig and hyperbolic trig functions) immediately, and multiplication, division, root, and power operations before addition and subtraction operations. But: you had to enter parameters first when using single-argument operations (e. g. 30 sin). As an example, the keypresses to calculate &quot;3 x log(4) + 5&quot; was entered almost as written, namely &quot;3 x 4 log + 5 =&quot;. This is because the calculator would execute the log function before performing the multiplication operation, and complete the multiplication operation before executing the addition operation. It did so by having unary operations operate on the X register, addition and subtraction operate on the X and Z registers, and multiplication, division, power, and root functions operate on the X and Y registers in its operational stack.

An unusual feature of the SR-50 was that its included functions like factorial and hyperbolic trig functions, which were found on very few calculators (including the HP-35 and HP-45) at the time. The user invoked the hyperbolic functions by entering the function argument and then pressing the &quot;hyp&quot; key, followed by the &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;cos&quot;, or &quot;tan&quot; function key. The inverse hyperbolic functions were accessed by first pressing the &quot;arc&quot; and &quot;hyp&quot; keys (in any order) and then pressing the &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;cos&quot;, or &quot;tan&quot; key. Hyperbolic trig arguments were always assumed to be in radians regardless of the setting of the degree/radian (D/R) mode switch. In addition to its three-register operational stack, consisting of X, Y, and Z registers, the SR-50 also included one memory (M) register to which the value in the X (display) register could be directly added using the &quot;summation&quot; key. The SR-50 had very fast trig functions (about half a second to evaluate each function) and was a popular calculator to use in contests involving pocket calculators.

== Technical data ==
* ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit): TMC0501
* SCOM (Scanning Read Only Memory): TMC0521
* Display driver: 2 × 27882
* Power: NiCd battery pack BP1 (3.6 V), charger AC9200 or AC9900

==Descendants==
The SR-50 was followed by the more advanced model SR-51. The SR-51 had the same physical dimensions but added a 2nd function for most buttons. Most notable among the added functions were the ability to enter x:y pairs and do linear regression analysis on them. The later and lighter versions SR-50A and SR-51II and SR-51III were based on smaller ICs and battery packs and reached broadest distribution.

A further update resulted in the programmable model SR-52 in late 1975. It was thicker and longer and could perform 224 program steps recorded on magnetic cards, similar to its competitor HP-65. The card was pulled through the reader by an electric motor. The matte white upper face of the cards could be marked with pen or pencil to indicate the program and the functions assigned to the calculator&#x27;s programmable keys. The card could be stored in a slot above the programmable keys with its markings visible. 

In 1976 Texas Instruments released the TI-30 budget calculator at one-third the price of the SR-50, so sales of the SR-50 quickly dropped.

<text>The DOT pictograms are a set of fifty pictograms used to convey information useful to travelers without using words. Such images are often used in airports, train stations, hotels, and other public places for foreign tourists, as well as being easier to identify than strings of text. Among these pictograms are graphics representing toilets and telephones. As a result of their near-universal acceptance, some describe them as the &quot;Helvetica&quot; of pictograms, and the character portrayed within them as Helvetica Man.

As works of the United States government, the images are in the public domain and thus can be used by anyone for any purpose, without licensing issues.

==History==

In the 1970s, the United States Department of Transportation recognized the shortcomings of pictograms drawn on an ad hoc basis at transportation-related facilities across the United States and commissioned the American Institute of Graphic Arts to produce a comprehensive set of pictograms. In collaboration with Roger Cook and Don Shanosky of Cook and Shanosky Associates, the designers conducted an exhaustive survey of pictograms already in use around the world, which drew from sources as diverse as Tokyo International Airport and the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The designers rated these pictograms based on criteria such as their legibility, their international recognizability and their resistance to vandalism. After determining which features were the most successful and appropriate, the designers drew a set of pictograms to represent 34 meanings requested by the DOT. The results of this research, as well as guidelines on how to best implement the symbols was presented in a report titled &quot;Symbol Signs – The development of Passenger/Pedestrian Oriented Symbols for Use in Transportation-Related Facilities&quot; in November 1974.

In 1979, 16 symbols were added, bringing the total count to 50.

==Development of symbols==
===Initial groundwork===
Symbols were collected from a variety of sources, including railways, Olympic events, airports and government agencies to form a catalog of each type of symbol to be created for close examination. A key goal was to avoid starting from scratch when possible, and instead build off previous development of robust symbol designs in existing systems.

===Evaluation===
The first overall step was to identify the symbols that were to be developed for the project, these were referred to as &#x27;message areas&#x27;. The Department of Transportation&#x27;s Office of Facilitation and AIGA committee devised the initial list of 34 messages. These messages were broken into four broad categories: &#x27;Public Services&#x27;, facility services and modes of transport (Telephones, toilets, first aid); &#x27;Concessions&#x27;, commercial activities (Car rental, coffee shop, shops); &#x27;Processing Activities&#x27;, passenger related processes (Ticket purchase, customs); &#x27;Regulations&#x27;, (No smoking, No entry).

Symbols that conveyed the messages sought by the committee from the 24 sources were broken into &#x27;concept groups&#x27;, a simple grouping of symbols that used similar general designs to convey the message. For example, &#x27;Telephone&#x27; symbols were divided into 4 concept groups: &#x27;Telephone handset&#x27;, &#x27;Telephone dial&#x27;, &#x27;Front view of dial telephone&#x27; and &#x27;Handset and dial&#x27;.

===Scoring===
Symbols were assessed on three characteristics: Semantic, syntactic, pragmatic.
Scores for these three categories were awarded by each committee member on a scale of 1 (weak) to 5 (strong). In addition to the individual score of each symbol, &#x27;concept groups&#x27; were given an overall score based on how well the concept met the three categories.

===Recommendations===
Finally they made recommendations and observations based on their scores and discussions about the symbols they reviewed. For the &#x27;Telephone&#x27; symbol, the handset icon was common but an odd shape that could be confusable for other items, like wrenches; while symbols with dials were easy to understand but already obsolete with the increased use of the push-button telephone.

The recommendations were summarized to suggest the final course of action to be taken with designing a symbol for the concept. For &quot;Telephone&quot;, the decision was made to &quot;Modify Group 1 concept; experiment with front view of modern telephone.&quot;

==Implementation==
&quot;Symbol Signs&quot; provides some general guidelines as to implement the symbols in a facility. The guidelines present guidance to a design team, rather than a strict set of requirements for typeface, sizes, colors, illumination, etc, that must be adhered to. This decision is intended to strike a balance between creating a perfect system while allowing symbols to appropriately integrate into the environment they&#x27;re being used in.

A typeface is not recommended, to allow flexibility for architectural and cultural needs of the facility. Emphasis is instead placed on examining the legibility and suitability for a particular typeface in the specific environment. In examples provided in &quot;Symbol Signs&quot; and when designing the symbols, Helvetica Medium, in an initial caps/start case was used by designers. This was particularly true of the design of the directional arrow. Letter size should be decided on a situational basis, using testing, however a general rule is that in height for ever of viewing distance.

The 1974 edition of &quot;Symbol Signs&quot; was strict in its presentation of symbols: Symbols must appear in a &#x27;symbol field&#x27;, consisting of a square with rounded corners. The &#x27;figure&#x27; must be black on a white symbol field, and never the reverse, white symbols on a black field.

Symbols were determined to be typically legible from approximately with a symbol to with a symbol. Attention should also be given to the mounting height of signs, as signs mounted so they fall outside of 10 degrees of the natural line of vision will no longer be in a normal line of vision, and require the viewer to actively look up in order to see and read the sign.

==Symbols==
===Original Set (1974)===
The original set of symbols developed consisted of 34 symbols, primarily intended for transportation facilities. First Aid, No Smoking, No Parking and No Entry used &quot;Ostwald number 6 1/2 pa&quot; for the color red.

===1979 Additions===
In 1979, the Department of Transportation requested 16 additional symbols, to fill in gaps observed in the original set. First Aid, No Smoking, No Parking, No Dogs, and No Entry used Pantone Red 032 C and Exit used Pantone Green 340 C.


===2000s===
An unofficial change has been forced to the original symbols following increased efforts by the American Red Cross to discourage and eliminate usage of the &#x27;red cross&#x27; symbol as a generic symbol of first aid or medical services. For example, in 1999 the Red Cross informed Ultimate Symbol that their 1996 publication &quot;Official Signs &amp; Icons&quot;, featuring various symbol collections, that the Red Cross in the AIGA pictogram collection was a violation of the Geneva Convention and United States trademark laws, and asked for its removal from future editions. In 2005, the second edition of &quot;Official Signs &amp; Icons&quot;, the red Greek cross was replaced with an identical Greek cross colored &#x27;Safety Green&#x27; from ANSI Z535.1–2002. The adoption of a green Greek cross or white Greek cross on a green background is a common replacement, due to the visual similarity and wide usage, as the white cross on green background is used in ISO 7010 to represent first aid.

<text>Richard Henry Carmona (born November 22, 1949) is an American physician, nurse, police officer, public health administrator, and politician. He was a vice admiral in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and served as the seventeenth Surgeon General of the United States. Appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, Carmona left office at the end of July 2006 upon the expiration of his term. After leaving office, Carmona was highly critical of the Bush administration for suppressing scientific findings which conflicted with the administration&#x27;s ideological agenda.

In August 2006, Carmona returned home to Tucson, Arizona. In November 2011, he announced he would seek the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for United States Senate in the hopes of succeeding outgoing Republican Senator Jon Kyl, despite being registered as a political independent. He narrowly lost to Republican challenger Congressman Jeff Flake.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Carmona was born in New York City, of Puerto Rican descent, and raised in Harlem. After dropping out of DeWitt Clinton High School at age 16, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1967. While enlisted, he received his General Educational Development (GED), joined the United States Army Special Forces, became a combat-decorated Vietnam War veteran, and began his career in medicine as a Special Forces Medic. For injuries he sustained in Vietnam, Carmona received two Purple Hearts.

After leaving active duty, Carmona attended the Bronx Community College of the City University of New York, where he earned his associate of arts degree in nursing. In 1977, he graduated from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology and chemistry; in 1979, he received his medical degree from UCSF, where he was awarded the gold-headed cane as the top graduate. In 1998, he earned a Master&#x27;s degree in Public Health (M.P.H.) from the University of Arizona.

==Medical career==
Carmona worked in various positions in the medical field including paramedic, registered nurse, and physician. He completed a surgical residency at UCSF and a National Institutes of Health-sponsored fellowship in trauma, burns, and critical care. Carmona is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and certified in correctional health care and in quality assurance. Carmona has been Chairman of the Arizona Southern Regional Emergency Medical System, Chief Medical Officer, hospital CEO, public health officer, and chief executive officer of the Pima County health care system. In 1997, the Pima County system, which was in financial trouble before he was appointed, continued to lose millions of dollars and he resigned. Carmona was not in control of the assets of the system but was held responsible for them. Carmona is also a professor of medicine at the University of Arizona.

==Law enforcement career==
Carmona worked for the Pima County Sheriff&#x27;s Department since 1986, eventually working his way up to deputy sheriff. He served as medical director of the county&#x27;s police and fire departments. He was a peace officer leader of the SWAT division, with expertise in special operations and emergency preparedness, including weapons of mass destruction.

In 1999, Carmona was off duty when he killed a motorist in a shootout at a Tucson intersection. Accounts of the incident vary, but Carmona says he spotted a driver assaulting another driver after a car accident and pulled over to help. Bystanders warned Carmona that the motorist was armed, and in the confrontation that ensued, which started by the motorist starting to place his gun down but quickly after grabs and shoots, grazing Carmona in the head, Carmona fired his weapon seven times, hitting the man three times and killing him. In the police interview at the scene, Carmona told officials he did not try to administer first aid after shooting the victim. Instead, he returned to his car to reload his weapon.

==Surgeon General==
===Nomination===
President Bush nominated Carmona to become the 17th Surgeon General of the United States in March 2002. During the nomination process, Carmona was questioned about his management style and the amount of time it took him to become board-certified in his field. Carmona described himself as an &quot;agent of change&quot; willing to question the status quo, but that he always treated &quot;patients, staff, and co-workers with respect.&quot; Senators on both sides of the aisle praised Carmona&#x27;s qualifications and supported his nomination; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 23, 2002, by a vote of 98–0.

===Secondhand smoke===
In 2006, Carmona released a landmark Surgeon General&#x27;s report on the health effects of secondhand smoke. Carmona&#x27;s report underlined the risks of secondhand smoke exposure, stating: &quot;The debate is over. The science is clear: Secondhand smoke is not a mere annoyance, but a serious health hazard.&quot; The report encouraged the adoption of indoor smoking bans and noted that such bans did not appear to have a harmful economic effect on bars and restaurants. After leaving office, Carmona testified before Congress that the Bush administration had tried for years to &quot;water down&quot; his findings on the dangers of secondhand smoke, and had pressured him not to testify in the tobacco industry&#x27;s racketeering trial.

In earlier testimony before the U.S. Congress, Carmona stated that he would not object to a ban on all tobacco products &quot;if Congress chose to go that way.&quot; The Bush administration distanced itself from this statement.

==Post-Surgeon General career==
Carmona is currently vice chairman of the Canyon Ranch resort and spa company, president of the non-profit Canyon Ranch Institute, and a professor at the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health at the University of Arizona. He is currently in-charge of COVID-19 response at the University of Arizona. On June 16, 2010, Ross University School of Medicine named Carmona to its board of trustees.

In 2006, Republicans attempted to recruit Carmona to run for Congress in Arizona&#x27;s 8th congressional district, but he declined.

On October 25, 2013, Carmona joined the Herbalife Board of Directors. Dr. Carmona commented, &quot;As a scientist and medical professional, I was first attracted by the depth and breadth of Herbalife&#x27;s commitment to excellence in nutrition science. As a business person, my due diligence showed me a company of integrity with a good business plan. As the son of poor emigrant parents, I am elated to see the opportunities Herbalife offers to families in health-disparate and economically underserved communities.&quot;

On September 6, 2021, Carmona joined the McKesson Corporation&#x27;s board of directors as a new independent director and the Board of Directors Compensation and Compliance Committees.

===Criticism of Bush administration===
On July 10, 2007, Carmona, along with former Surgeons General C. Everett Koop and David Satcher, testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about political and ideological interference with the Surgeon General&#x27;s mission. Carmona accused the Bush administration of preventing him from speaking out on certain public health issues such as embryonic stem cell research, global climate change, emergency contraception, and abstinence-only sex education, where the administration&#x27;s political stance conflicted with scientific and medical opinion.

Carmona also testified that the Bush administration had attempted for years to &quot;water down&quot; his report on the dangers of secondhand smoke and pressured him not to testify in the tobacco industry&#x27;s racketeering trial: &quot;Anything that doesn&#x27;t fit into the political appointees&#x27; ideological, theological or political agenda is ignored, marginalized or simply buried.&quot; According to Carmona, he was even ordered not to attend the Special Olympics because the event was sponsored by the Kennedy family, and was told to mention President Bush three times on every page of his speeches. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; subsequently identified William R. Steiger as the Bush administration official who had blocked release of Carmona&#x27;s report on global health because it conflicted with the administration&#x27;s political priorities.

Carmona said that his predecessors as Surgeon General had told him, &quot;We have never seen it as partisan, as malicious, as vindictive, as mean-spirited as it is today, and you clearly have worse than anyone&#x27;s had.&quot; Koop&#x27;s testimony indicated that he had been subject to less political pressure than his successors: President Reagan was pressed by his officials to fire him, but Reagan refused. Moreover, Koop indicated that each of his successors had had less access to the Secretary of Health and Human Services than he had: Satcher had been granted less access than him, and &quot;Dr. Carmona was treated with even less respect than Dr. Satcher.&quot;

==2012 U.S. Senate election==
Carmona was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Arizona in the race to replace retiring Republican Senator Jon Kyl. Carmona said that he would bring his experience in science and medicine to the Senate, which will inform his analytical approach to the issues. He has been critical of politicians like Todd Akin and said that health issues should not be politicized.

On November 6, 2012, he lost to Republican challenger Jeff Flake.

==Electoral history==



==Personal life==
Carmona is married to Diana Sanchez. They have two daughters, two sons, two granddaughters, and two grandsons. Carmona resides in Tucson, Arizona.

In the 2024 United States presidential election, Carmona endorsed Kamala Harris.

<doc id="918943" wikidata="Q267214" url="?curid=918943" title="Sefton Delmer">
<text>Denis Sefton Delmer (24 May 1904 – 4 September 1979) was a British journalist of Australian heritage and propagandist for the British government during the Second World War. 

Born in Berlin and fluent in German, he became friendly with Ernst Röhm, who arranged for him to interview Adolf Hitler in 1931. As an announcer for the BBC German service in 1939, his provocative on-air reaction to Hitler&#x27;s offer of peace caused the German authorities to add his name to the &quot;Special Search List&quot; for arrest after they had invaded Britain. During the war, he led a black propaganda campaign against Hitler by radio from England. 

==Early life==

Denis Sefton Delmer, known familiarly as &quot;Tom&quot;, was born in Berlin as a British subject, as a son of Australian parents living in Germany. His father, Frederick Sefton Delmer, was British of Australian heritage, born in Hobart, Tasmania, who became Professor of English Literature at Berlin University and author of a standard textbook for German schools. 

On the outbreak of the First World War his father was interned in Ruhleben internment camp, near Berlin, as an enemy alien. In 1917, the Delmer family was repatriated to England in a prisoner exchange between the British and German governments. He was brought up to speak only German until the age of five, and as late as 1939 spoke English with a slight accent.

Delmer was educated at the , Berlin, St Paul&#x27;s School, London, and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he obtained a second-class degree in modern languages.

==Early career==

After leaving university, Delmer worked as a freelance journalist until he was recruited by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to become head of its new Berlin Bureau. Whilst in Germany, he became friendly with Ernst Röhm, who arranged for him to become the first British journalist to interview Adolf Hitler, in April 1931.

In the 1932 German federal election, Delmer travelled with Hitler aboard his private aircraft. He was &quot;embedded with Nazi party activists&quot; at this time, &quot;taking copious notes on everything from the style of the would-be Führer&#x27;s oratory to the group think that lay behind the bond he was forming with the German people.&quot; He was also present in 1933 when Hitler inspected the aftermath of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; fire. During this period, Delmer was criticised for being a Nazi sympathiser, and for a time, the British government thought he was in the pay of the Nazis. At the same time, the Nazi leaders were convinced Delmer was a member of MI6; his denials of any involvement only served to strengthen their belief that he was not only a member, but an important one.

In 1933, Delmer was sent to France as head of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; Paris Bureau. In 1936, Delmer married the artist Isabel Nichols. Delmer covered important events in Europe including the Spanish Civil War (reporting with Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Herbert Matthews) and the invasion of Poland by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in 1939. He also reported on the German western offensive in 1940.

==Wartime==

Delmer returned to Britain and worked for a time as an announcer for the German Service of the BBC. After Hitler broadcast a speech from the &quot;Reichstag&quot; offering peace terms, Delmer responded immediately, stating that the British hurl the terms &quot;right back at you, in your evil-smelling teeth&quot;. When, in 1945, Delmer learnt that he had been placed on Germany&#x27;s &quot;Special Search List&quot; for arrest after the invasion of Britain, he concluded that it was this broadcast that had put him there. Delmer&#x27;s instant (but unauthorised) rejection had a great impact on Germany, where Joseph Goebbels concluded it had to have come from the government. The forthright reaction caused consternation in Berlin, where it was assumed that it could not have been made without official clearance, but the lack of authorisation was later condemned in a House of Commons debate, with Richard Stokes, M.P., deploring that the response had been made without the authority of parliament.

Delmer considered that British wartime attempts to counter German propaganda were misguided, with broadcasts aimed at anti-Nazis who did not need convincing, in what today we call an echo chamber of like-minded people. When he was in a position to do so, he broadcast posing as a fanatical Nazi who was critical of the Nazi leadership, using salacious material about officials&#x27; sadomasochistic orgies, luring in listeners and breaking taboos about insulting Nazi officials. About 40% of German soldiers listened to Delmer&#x27;s stations; they were among the top three in Munich, and very effective.

===Radio stations===

In September 1940, Delmer was recruited by the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) to organise black propaganda broadcasts to Nazi Germany as part of a psychological warfare campaign. Leonard Ingrams of the PWE gained clearance for Delmer to work for the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. The operation joined a number of other &quot;research units&quot; operating propaganda broadcasts, based at Wavendon Tower (now in Milton Keynes), but in Spring 1941, Delmer was given his own base, a former private house in nearby Aspley Guise. 

The concept was that the radio station would undermine Hitler by pretending to be a fervent Hitler-Nazi supporter. Under Delmer&#x27;s leadership a number of notable people played a part: Muriel Spark, Ellic Howe, and Delmer&#x27;s college friend, the cartoonist Osbert Lancaster. Some of Lancaster&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; cartoons were reprinted into booklets aimed at civilians under German occupation and dropped by the RAF.

Delmer&#x27;s first, most notable success was a shortwave station: &quot;Gustav Siegfried Eins&quot; (Gustave Siegfried One), G3 in the Research units. It was &quot;run&quot; by the character &quot;Der Chef&quot;, an unrepentant Nazi, who disparaged both Winston Churchill (&quot;that flatfooted son of a drunken Jew&quot;) and the &quot;Parteikommune&quot;, the &quot;Party Commune&quot; supporters who betrayed the Nazi revolution. The station name, &quot;Gustav Siegfried Eins&quot; (phonetic alphabet for &quot;GS1&quot;) left a question in listeners&#x27; minds – did it mean &quot;Geheimsender 1&quot;: (Secret Transmitter 1) or &quot;Generalstab 1&quot; (General Staff 1)? 

&quot;GS1&quot; went on the air on the evening of 23 May 1941 — earlier than intended, to exploit the capture of Hitler&#x27;s deputy, Rudolf Hess, in Britain. , a former German writer of detective stories who had fled Nazi Germany, was recruited from a Pioneer Corps bomb-disposal squad in London and he was the first member of the team to arrive at the discreet house known as &quot;The Rookery&quot; in Aspley Guise. He played &quot;Der Chef&quot;. (In Delmer&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Black Boomerang&quot; he acknowledges that &quot;Some of the names of persons mentioned in this book have been camouflaged [ … ]&quot; and Seckelmann was there named &quot;Paul Sanders&quot;. ) A journalist, , using the name &quot;Johannes Reinholz&quot;, arrived soon after and played the adjutant to &quot;Der Chef&quot;. Both men assisted Delmer with the scripts. The recordings were made on disc and taken by courier for transmission from a Foreign Office transmitter at nearby Signal Hill, Gawcott.

When Sir Stafford Cripps discovered what Delmer was involved with (through the intervention of Richard Crossman, who had sent him a transcript from the broadcast of one of Delmer&#x27;s more salacious inventions), Cripps wrote to Anthony Eden, then Foreign Secretary: &quot;If this is the sort of thing that is needed to win the war, why, I&#x27;d rather lose it.&quot; Delmer was defended by Robert Bruce Lockhart, who pointed out the need to reach the sadist in the German nature. GS1 ran for 700 broadcasts before Delmer killed it off in late 1943 with gunfire heard over the radio intimating that the authorities had caught up with &quot;Der Chef&quot;. Owing to an error by a non-German-speaking transmitter engineer, the programme was accidentally repeated and &quot;Der Chef&#x27;s&quot; dramatic on-air murder was broadcast twice.

Delmer created several stations and was successful through a careful use of intelligence using gossip intercepted in German mail to neutral countries to create credible stories. Delmer&#x27;s credit within the intelligence agencies was such that the Admiralty sought him out to target German submarine crews with demoralising news bulletins. For this, Delmer had access to Aspidistra, a 500 kW radio transmitter obtained from RCA in the US (their largest off-the-shelf-model), which Section VIII bought for £165,000. Use of Aspidistra, which began in 1942, was split between PWE, the BBC, and the RAF. 

Delmer&#x27;s creation was &quot;Deutscher Kurzwellensender Atlantik&quot; (or popularly &quot;Atlantiksender&quot;). This station used US jazz (banned within Germany as decadent) and up-to-date dance music from Germany (extracted via Sweden and RAF courier), as well as an in-house German dance band. Important details on naval procedures came from anti-Nazis identified in POW camps, whose mail was sifted to create personalised announcements. The presenter (&quot;Vicki&quot;) was Agnes Bernelle, a refugee of part-Jewish origin from Berlin.

&quot;Christ the King&quot; (G.8) broadcast an attack on the conscience of religious Germans, telling of the horrors of the labour and concentration camps, through a German priest.

===Soldatensender Calais===

&quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; (&quot;Calais Armed Forces Radio Station&quot;) was another clandestine radio station Delmer directed at the German armed forces. Based in Milton Bryan and connected by high-quality telephone lines for transmission from the Aspidistra transmitter at Crowborough, &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; produced live broadcasts, a combination of popular music, &quot;cover&quot; support of the war, and &quot;dirt&quot; – items inserted to demoralise German forces. Delmer&#x27;s black propaganda sought to propagate rumours that German soldiers&#x27; wives were sleeping with the many foreign workers in Germany at the time. Bernelle, again, was presenter.

The station also proved to be popular on the German home front. While the station was in the format of a German military station, it did not pose as an actual Nazi station; but although listeners knew the station was run by the British, they listened to and trusted it, and could use the excuse that they thought it was a legitimate German station if caught listening to it. 

Delmer also oversaw the production of a daily &quot;grey&quot; German-language newspaper titled &quot;Nachrichten für die Truppe&quot; (&quot;News for the Troops&quot;), which first appeared in May 1944, much of its text being based on the &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; broadcasts. &quot;Nachrichten für die Truppe&quot; was written by a team provided to Delmer by SHAEF, and disseminated over Germany, Belgium and France each morning by the Special Leaflet Squadron of the US Eighth Air Force.

When fighting entered Germany itself, black propaganda was used to create an impression of an anti-Nazi resistance movement.

At the end of the war in Europe, Delmer advised his colleagues not to publicise the work they had been involved in, lest unrepentant Nazis claim (as had been the case after the First World War), that they had been defeated by unconscionable methods, rather than on the battlefield. Consequently, former Nazis were able to claim, without contradiction, that they had assisted the fictitious resistance movement; Delmer described this unintended consequence as a &quot;black boomerang&quot;.

In December 1945, Delmer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), with the citation specifying merely that he was &quot;Controller of a Division, Foreign Office&quot;.

==Later career and retirement==

After the Second World War, Delmer returned to the &quot;Daily Express&quot; as chief foreign affairs reporter. Reinhard Gehlen stated it was Delmer&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; article of 17 March 1952 which dragged the German intelligence chief into the daylight by unleashing a &quot;flood of further publications&quot;. Over the next fifteen years, he covered nearly every major foreign news story for the newspaper. However, he was sacked by Lord Beaverbrook in 1959 over an expenses issue, and retired to Lamarsh in Essex, near Little Sampford, where his former wife Isabel lived with her third husband. He died at Lamarsh, after a long illness, on 4 September 1979.

Delmer wrote two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Trail Sinister&quot; (1961) and &quot;Black Boomerang&quot; (1962), and several other books, including &quot;Weimar Germany&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Counterfeit Spy&quot; (1971), an account of the Double-Cross deception. David Hare based his play &quot;Licking Hitler&quot; on &quot;Black Boomerang&quot;, and his plot included the faked, on-air discovery and shooting of the broadcaster, in the same way as Delmer had finished the career of &quot;Der Chef&quot;.

Delmer was the subject of a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; broadcast in 1962, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews outside Le Caprice restaurant in London&#x27;s Mayfair. He was the subject of a book and BBC Radio 4 series by Peter Pomerantsev in 2024.

<doc id="918946" wikidata="Q7941044" url="?curid=918946" title="Volunteer Political Party">
<text>The Volunteer Political Party (VPP) was a loyalist political party launched in Northern Ireland on 22 June 1974 by members of the then recently legalised Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The Chairman was Ken Gibson from East Belfast, an ex-internee and UVF chief of staff at the time. The success of the Ulster Workers Council Strike had shown some UVF leaders the political power they held and they sought to develop this potential further. The UVF had been banned by the Government of Northern Ireland in 1966, but was legalised at the same time as Sinn Féin by Labour Secretary of State Merlyn Rees in April 1974 in order to encourage a political path for Loyalist and republican paramilitary groups.

It launched its manifesto &quot;The Volunteer Political Party - a progressive and forward thinking unionist party&quot; at a press conference on 27 September. Influenced by the thinking of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, it opposed internment without trial and the idea of independence for Northern Ireland and supported a more equitable distribution of resources to deprived parts of the United Kingdom. The party applied to join the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) but was rebuffed, with the mainstream unionist parties wary of being linked to paramilitaries.

Ken Gibson contested the West Belfast seat, which included parts of the Shankill district, in the October 1974 general election. Despite the security risks, the VPP
also carried out some limited canvassing on the Catholic Falls Road. The VPP claimed to stand for the working class and an election pamphlet attacked the disgraceful social conditions on the Shankill. In the election, Gibson was supported by Glen Barr of Vanguard, Charles Harding Smith, the leader of the West Belfast Ulster Defence Association and the independent Shankill councillor Hugh Smyth, who went on to become one of the founders of the Progressive Unionist Party. Standing against the official UUUC candidate, Johnny McQuade of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), they won only 2,690 votes (6%), 14% of the total unionist vote.

Because of this failure, the party was dissolved the following month by a meeting of all UVF commanders. A statement announced; &quot;The low poll for the VPP candidate indicates that the general public does not support the political involvement of the UVF. It would therefore be fruitless to promote the Volunteer Party as a party political machine&quot;. Most of its members returned to the UVF (some of whom were later to form the Progressive Unionist Party). The UVF turned back to violence and was banned again by the British government on 4 October 1975.

<text>Chickadee (formerly stylized as chickaDEE) is a Canadian monthly children&#x27;s magazine. It was founded in 1979 as a spin-off of &quot;OWL Magazine&quot; geared towards younger readers. Its headquarters is in Toronto.

Originally, the magazine was aimed at kids up to the age of eight and focused on science and nature. Founding editor Janis Nostbakken created a mix of puzzles, activities, and stories, including recurring characters such as Henry the Pig and Daisy, the transforming heroine of the &quot;Daisy Dreamer&quot; comics.

Over time the magazine has become aiming at kids aged six to nine, and has gradually become a more general-purpose children&#x27;s magazine.

The magazine was published by the Young Naturalist Foundation. In 1997, &quot;Chickadee&quot; (as well as sister publications &quot;OWL&quot; and &quot;Chirp&quot;) was purchased by Bayard Canada, which also owns a number of French-language children&#x27;s magazines, including &quot;Les Débrouillards&quot; and &quot;Les Explorateurs&quot;.

<text>Stephanie Jayne Cook, MBE (born 7 February 1972) is a British retired modern pentathlete. She was the Olympic champion at this event in 2000.

Cook was born in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland. She was educated at Bedford High School; The Perse School for Girls; Peterhouse, Cambridge and then Lincoln College, Oxford, where she read medicine.

Having rowed at Cambridge, she took up modern pentathlon whilst completing her course in clinical medicine at Oxford. She was president of the Oxford University Modern Pentathlon Association in 1995–1996, and won the women&#x27;s individual title in the Varsity match against Cambridge in 1997.

Although reported as &quot;having put her medical career on hold&quot;, she was supported through her training from 1998 to 2000 by Consultant Surgeon Mark Whiteley who funded a research job for her in Guildford, during which she published three papers with him. She paid him tribute in 2002 during the TV programme &quot;This is Your Life&quot;.

Cook won the gold medal in the Sydney 2000 Olympics in the women&#x27;s modern pentathlon, the first time that the event was included in the games. She went on to win individual World and European titles in 2001 before retiring from the sport. Her particular strength was running.

== Honours ==
In the 2001 New Year Honours, Cook was appointed as a member of the Order of The British Empire for services to modern pentathlon. In 2008, she was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Medicine) from the University of Bath.

<doc id="918969" wikidata="Q1000336" url="?curid=918969" title="Tandil">
<text>Tandil is the main city of the homonymous partido (department), located in Argentina, in the southeast of Buenos Aires Province, just north-northwest of Tandilia hills. The city was founded in 1823, and its name originates from the &quot;Piedra Movediza&quot; (&quot;Moving Stone&quot;) which fell in 1912. The city is the birthplace of many notable sports personalities, as well as former president of Argentina Mauricio Macri.

==Geography==
Tandil is located above sea level and its coordinates are . The city borders Rauch and Azul (to the north), Ayacucho and Balcarce (to the east), Lobería, Necochea and Benito Juárez (to the south) and Azul and Benito Juárez (to the west).

Tandil is situated approximately midway between La Plata (the provincial capital), to its NE, and Bahía Blanca, lying the same distance to its SW; it is also NW of Mar del Plata, and SSW of Buenos Aires. Tandil is in a zone within the Pampas known as the Humid Pampas.

According to the 2010 census (INDEC), Tandil had a population of 116,916. The total area of the Tandil partido is .

===Climate===
Tandil&#x27;s climate is mild and humid (classified as &quot;Cfb&quot; or an oceanic climate under the Köppen climate classification), with an average temperature of and of precipitation annually. Mornings are often cold in autumn, winter and spring, and generally fresh in the summer. Fog is very common in autumn and winter, when frosts are also common. Minimum temperatures below have been recorded in the winter months. Rainfall occurs throughout the year but more frequently in summer. Snow are not very common.

The climatological data in the table below is from the period 1991–2020:

==Place name==
It is widely believed that the name of the city comes from the Mapuche words &quot;tan&quot; (&quot;falling&quot;), and &quot;lil&quot; (&quot;rock&quot;). It is probably a reference to the &quot;Piedra Movediza&quot; (&quot;Moving Stone&quot;), a large boulder which stood seemingly miraculously balanced on the edge of a rocky foothill. In order to demonstrate the slight movements of the boulder, it was common practice to place bottles under its base to watch them shatter. The &quot;Moving Stone&quot; toppled on February 29, 1912, and split into two pieces at the bottom of the hill.

In May 2007, a fix replica was set up in the same place where the original stood. The replica, made by engineering students, is actually cemented in place and does not teeter the way the original did.

==History==
The town was founded by Martín Rodríguez on April 4, 1823, named &quot;Fuerte Independencia&quot; (Fort Independence). In time the original natives became assimilated and mingled with the increasing European population. The vast majority of immigrants came from Spain and Italy, but also Danish people settled mainly guided by the Danish College of Missions, the latter constituting a very active community. Tandil was designated a city (although by modern standards it was a large town) in 1895 and became a popular tourist destination attracting people from Buenos Aires and other parts of Argentina.

The &quot;Piedra Movediza&quot; fell in 1912 and split in two below. Although it is impossible after the fact to ascertain the reason it fell, it is very possible that the delicately balanced rock was thrown off balance by the common practice of placing glass bottles under it and watching them explode. This was the way the locals would prove to visitors that the rock, in fact, moved, since the movement was too subtle to be detected by the naked eye. There have been projects to restore the rock, and a replica stone was placed where the original used to be. Other similar stones like &quot;El Centinela&quot; are also attractions, but none has the truly astonishing quality of teetering ever so slowly like the &quot;moving rock&quot; once did.

==National University of Central Buenos Aires Province==
The National University of Central Buenos Aires Province (&quot;Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia Buenos Aires&quot;) is a public university located in Tandil. It was founded in 1974 as part of University of Buenos Aires Professor Alberto Taquini&#x27;s plan to geographically diversify Argentina&#x27;s National University system.

Established with the unification of a private school and a campus of the National University of the South, with more than 11,000 students, the university includes 10 schools offering 21 undergraduate, 58 graduate, and 19 post-graduate degrees. It maintains secondary campuses in Azul and Olavarría.

<text>John Edward Mellish (12 January 1886 – 13 July 1970, Medford, Oregon) was an American amateur astronomer and telescope builder.

==Biography==
Mellish was born in Wisconsin, the son of Arthur Mellish (1862–1928) and Judith Sedora Stimson Mellish (1864–1954). Mellish lived outside of Madison, Wisconsin in Cottage Grove. By age 24 he was credited with discovering or co-discovering two comets: C/1907 G1 (Grigg–Mellish) and C/1907 T1 (Mellish) using home built telescopes, and received astronomical medals from both the United States and Mexico as a result. He later discovered another three comets: C/1915 C1 (Mellish), C/1915 R1 (Mellish), and C/1917 F1 (Mellish).

In November 1915 he announced to have observed craters on Mars, and being the second person to do so after E. E. Barnard. Both claims are disputed to this day, but he is still credited to be the first human to recognize craters on Mars using the great 40-inch Yerkes refractor.

A crater on Mars (Mellish) was named in his honor.

In 1931, Mellish confessed to committing incest with his 15-year-old daughter. Astronomers advocated that he be spared jail time because of his value to science, and it was proposed that he be sterilized. Mellish was held in the Kane County Jail from September 1931 to April 1933, when he was paroled, and he moved to California. His wife divorced him in May 1933 and was given custody of their eight children.

After living in Escondido, California from 1933 to 1936, Mellish relocated to a ranch at Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. However he returned to Escondido, where he and his son were arrested in 1938 on charges involving two juvenile girls. Mellish died in Medford, Oregon, in 1970.

<text>Sir Edward Penley Abraham, (10 June 1913 – 8 May 1999) was an English biochemist instrumental in the development of the first antibiotics penicillin and cephalosporin.

==Early life and education==
Abraham was born on 10 June 1913 at 47 South View Road, Shirley, Southampton. From 1924 Abraham attended King Edward VI School, Southampton, before achieving a First in Chemistry at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Abraham completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Sir Robert Robinson, during which he was the first to crystallise lysozyme, an enzyme discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming and shown to have antibacterial properties, and was later the first enzyme to have its structure solved using X-ray crystallography, by Lord David Phillips.

== Research ==
In 1938 Abraham won a Rockefeller Foundation travel fellowship and spent a year in Stockholm at the Biokemiska Institut.

He then moved back to Oxford and became part of a research team led by Sir Howard Florey at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, responsible for the development of penicillin and its medical applications. Abraham was specifically involved in the purification process and determination of its chemical structure. In 1940 Abraham discovered penicillinase as the cause of bacterial resistance to antibiotics such as penicillin. In October 1943 Abraham and Sir Ernst Boris Chain proposed a novel beta-lactam structure with a fused two ring system. This proposal was confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Hodgkin using X-ray crystallography. Florey formally recognised Abraham&#x27;s work in 1948 by nominating him to be one of the first three &quot;penicillin&quot; research Fellows at Lincoln College, Oxford.

Later that year samples of a &quot;Cephalosporium acremonium&quot; fungus with antibacterial properties were received from Giuseppe Brotzu. Abraham and Guy Newton purified the antibiotics from this fungus and found one, cephalosporin C, was not degraded by penicillinase and hence able to cure infections from penicillin-resistant bacteria. During a skiing holiday in 1958 Abraham conceived the structure of cephalosporin C, which he then went on to establish with Newton, and was confirmed by Dorothy Hodgkin through X-ray crystallography. Abraham showed that modification of the 7-amino-cephalosporanic acid nucleus was able to increase the potency of this antibiotic and registered a patent on the compound. This resulted in the first commercially sold cephalosporin antibiotic Cefalotin sold by Eli Lilly and Company. There are now five generations of cephalosporins, of which some are among the few remaining antibiotics for the treatment of MRSA.

In 1964 he became Professor of Chemical Pathology, and remained a Fellow of Lincoln until his retirement in 1980.

== Personal life ==
Abraham was born at 47 South View Road, Shirley, Southampton. His parents were Maria Agnes Abraham, née Hearne and Albert Penley Abraham, a customs and excise officer.

In 1938 he met Asbjörg Harung from Norway whom he married in Bergen the following year: she remained in Norway, trapped by the German invasion, before escaping to Sweden in 1942 when she was reunited with her husband. They had a son Michael Erling Penley Abraham, born in Oxford in July 1943.

Edward Abraham died in May 1999, in Oxford, following a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Asbjörg.

Sir Edward and Lady Abraham lived at Badgers Wood, Bedwells Heath, Boars Hill, where part of the land, &quot;Abraham Wood&quot; is now managed by the Oxford Preservation Trust.

== Legacy ==
He was a noted biochemist, his work on antibiotics producing great clinical advances. His principal work was concerned with the development of penicillin, and also later cephalosporin, an antibiotic capable of destroying penicillin-resistant bacteria. These vital drugs are now used extensively in the treatment of various infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, septicaemia and infected surgical wounds.

Through the registration of the patent on cephalosporin, he was able to generate a regular income, which he devoted almost entirely to the establishment of two charitable trusts for the support of biomedical research, the Edward Penley Abraham Research Fund, the E.P.A. Cephalosporin Fund and The Guy Newton Research Fund. As of 2016 the combined endowment of these charities is over £194 million. By the end of the twentieth century, the charitable funds had donated more than £30m to the University of Oxford, mainly to the Dunn School of Pathology and to Lincoln College, along with other grants to The Royal Society and King Edward VI School, Southampton. Four recent Oxford buildings received funds from Abraham&#x27;s trusts:
* the EP Abraham research building (completed in 2001, on South Parks Road)
* Lincoln College&#x27;s EPA Science Centre (an accommodation and conferencing complex, including Lady Abraham House, completed in 2005, on Museum Road),
* Linacre College&#x27;s Edward &amp; Asbjörg Abraham Building (completed in 1995)
* The Oxford Molecular Pathology Institute, completed in 2011, is also largely funded by proceeds from Abrahams patents.

Funding from these trusts have also helped to establish two scholarship programmes for doctoral students at the University of Oxford (the Oxford-E P Abraham Research Fund Graduate Scholarship and the Oxford-EPA Cephalosporin Graduate Scholarship).

Abraham Wood is a bluebell wood at Boars Hill donated to the Oxford Preservation Trust in memory of Sir Edward and Lady Abraham.

== Awards ==
Abraham was the recipient of many awards over his lifetime:
* Fellow of the Royal Society in 1958
* CBE in the 1973 New Year Honours
* Royal Medal of the Royal Society (1973)
* Knight Bachelor in 1980
* Mullard Award of the Royal Society (1980)
* Scheele Award in 1975
* Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983.

<doc id="918986" wikidata="Q5338825" url="?curid=918986" title="Contempt">
<text>In colloquial usage, contempt usually refers to either the act of despising, or having a general lack of respect for something. This set of emotions generally produces maladaptive behaviour. Other authors define contempt as a negative emotion rather than the constellation of mentality and feelings that produce an &quot;attitude&quot;. Paul Ekman categorises contempt as the seventh basic emotion, along with anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. Robert C. Solomon places contempt on the same emotional continuum as resentment and anger, and he argues that the differences between the three are that resentment is anger directed towards a higher-status individual; anger is directed towards an equal-status individual; and contempt is anger directed towards a lower-status individual.

==Etymology==
The term originated in 1393 in Old French from the Latin word &quot;contemptus&quot; meaning &quot;scorn&quot;. It is the past participle of &quot;contemnere&quot; and from &quot;con&quot;- intensive prefix + &quot;temnere&quot; &quot;to slight, scorn&quot;; &quot;contemptuous&quot; appeared in 1529.

==Cultural context==
Ekman and Friesen (1986) identified a specific facial expression that observers in ten different cultures, both Western and non-Western, agreed signaled contempt. In this study, residents of West Sumatra, Indonesia, viewed photos of American, Japanese, and Indonesian people. Their ability to classify some facial expressions as contempt versus the primary emotions of anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, fear, or surprise showed that across cultures, general contempt is universally understood (with level of agreement equating to 75%).
&quot;An expression in which the corner of the lip is tightened and raised slightly on one side of the face (or much more strongly on one side than the other) signaled contempt.&quot; This study showed that contempt, as well as the outward expression of contempt, can be pointed out across Western and Non-Western peoples when contrasted with other primary emotions.

In American English the use of the word &quot;contempt&quot; has declined since the early 19th century, while in the 21st century the word &quot;disrespect&quot; has become relatively more common.

==Characteristics==
Paul Ekman, a widely recognized psychologist, found six emotions that were universally recognized: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Findings on contempt are less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized.

In the 1990s, Ekman proposed an expanded list of emotions, this time including contempt.

==Defining features==
Contempt has five features. Contempt requires a judgment concerning the appearance or standing of the object of contempt. In particular, contempt involves the judgment that, because of some moral or personal failing or defect, the contemned person has compromised his or her standing &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; an interpersonal standard that the contemptor treats as important. This may have not been done deliberately but by a lack of status. This lack of status may cause the contemptuous to classify the object of contempt as utterly worthless, or as not fully meeting a particular interpersonal standard. Therefore, contempt is a response to a perceived failure to meet an interpersonal standard. Contempt is also a particular way of regarding or attending to the object of contempt, and this form of regard has an unpleasant affective element. Contempt may be experienced as a highly visceral emotion similar to disgust, or as cool disregard.

Contempt has a certain comparative element. In David Hume&#x27;s studies of contempt, he suggests that contempt essentially requires apprehending the &quot;bad qualities&quot; of someone &quot;as they really are&quot; while simultaneously making a comparison between this person and ourselves. Because of this reflexive element, contempt also involves what we might term a &quot;positive self-feeling&quot; of the contemptuous. A characteristic of contempt is the psychological withdrawal or distance one typically feels regarding the object of one&#x27;s contempt. This psychological distancing is an essential way of expressing one&#x27;s nonidentification with the object of one&#x27;s contempt and it precludes sympathetic identification with the object of contempt. (Hume, 2002, 251) Contempt for a person involves a way of negatively and comparatively regarding or attending to someone who has not fully lived up to an interpersonal standard that the person extending contempt thinks is important. This form of regard constitutes a psychological withdrawal from the object of contempt.

==Virtues==
Contempt can serve a useful purpose in a moral community. An ethics of contempt provides a much larger breadth of answers than other competing systems of ethics, whether they be based on ethics of actions (judging actions by their rightness or wrongness) or ethics of feelings (e.g., ethics of resentment). By feeling contempt for those things which are found to be unethical, immoral, or morally unsavory, one can both show that they are bad and remove them from the moral community.

==Response==
The main response of contempt lies within &quot;publicized expression of low regard for the objects held in contempt&quot; (Miller, C.H., 2005). By this reasoning, a person holding contempt would not have the urge to openly confront the person with whom they are at odds, nor would they themselves try to remove the object of contempt; rather, one who holds contempt would have the tendency to hold the view that others should remove the object of contempt, or hold the view that the object of contempt should remove itself. So while one would make their feelings known to others, the person with contempt would not necessarily want to directly deal with the situation at hand. One who is experiencing contempt would exhibit negative affective behaviors that may be labeled as &quot;cold&quot; – this simply meaning that one who is experiencing the emotion of contempt would tend to alienate those responsible.

==Contempt in relationships==
===Gender differences===
Men and women act differently when displaying contempt in same-sex relationships. Not only do girls engage in more non-verbal forms of social aggression than boys do, girls dissembled more than boys do, speaking nicely but making mean faces. In the research provided by Underwood (2004) in their laboratory observation studies where they watch girls and boys in an identical social context in which best friends respond to a provoking newcomer, gender differences emerge not for the verbal behaviours, but for the nonverbal expressions of disdain and contempt (which are so glaring that they were observed with high degrees of inter-coder reliability by both women and men, kappa&#x27;s exceeding .8; Underwood et al., 2003).

There are several reasons why girls can be especially prone to conveying anger and contempt by nonverbal forms of social exclusion. One reason may be that girls are socialized from infancy onward to be overtly nice and conciliatory and do so to avoid conflict whenever possible, for fear of being excluded from relationships, disliked, or punished (for reviews, see Brown and Gilligan, 1993; Underwood, 2003; Zahn-Waxler, 2000). Non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be a highly effective way to harm someone with relatively few social consequences; the hurtful act is fleeting, can often be executed behind the victim&#x27;s back and outside of the watchful eyes of adults, and, even if caught, mean faces are typically not punished. Second, girls may hurt one another via non-verbal expressions of exclusion or disdain because girls and women may gaze at others more for reasons related to their lower social status, so as to learn as much as possible about others&#x27; needs and desires (see LaFrance, 2002, for a discussion of &#x27;Smile boycotts and other body politics&#x27;, p. 319).

Because girls and women gaze at others often, perhaps mean glares are more effective as a means of wielding power. Third, non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be powerful for girls because their relationships involve high levels of intimacy and self-disclosure (see Buhrmester and Prager, 1995, for a review), thus even subtle indicators of exclusion are threatening. Fourth, non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be powerful for girls because although they fiercely desire and defend popularity with other girls, they dread being labelled as &#x27;stuck up&#x27; (Merten, 1997).

===Legal responses===
In 2003, the Palo Alto City Council defeated a resolution that would have discouraged elected officials from facial expressions conveying contempt at public meetings; this was proposed because council members were so weary of colleagues intimidating one another by these subtle but rude facial expressions.

===Marriage===
Research demonstrates how childhood abuse ties into maladaptive communication dynamics consisting of contempt-laden conflict and emotional withdrawal. These findings are important because maladaptive marital communication may be one mechanism by which traumatic childhood experiences translate into poor adult relationship quality. Forms of verbal aggression, such as contempt, belligerence, and defensiveness, are associated with destructive, hostile patterns of conflict resolution ([Gottman et al., 1998] and [Straus, 1979]). Couples who use such communication styles are more likely to have higher levels of marital distress (Roberts, 2000), lower levels of marital satisfaction (Holman and Jarvis, 2003), and lower levels of marital stability ([Gottman et al., 1998], [Holman and Jarvis, 2003] and [DeMaris, 2000]).

Gottman (1999) identified several behaviors that are particularly indicative of distress in relationships. One series of behaviors, which he termed the &quot;four horsemen&quot;, includes a cascading of responses such as expressing criticism, defensiveness, contempt, sarcasm, hostility, and withdrawal, the combination of which indicates a critical state of marriage dissolution.

Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) found that &quot;Negative emotional behavior, such as expressed anger, sadness, contempt, and other negative emotions, appears to be the best discriminator between satisfied and dissatisfied marriages&quot;. Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) also discovered that &quot;In terms of speaker behaviors, wives were coded as showing more total emotion, negative emotion, anger, joy, contempt, whining, and sadness.&quot; This supports the stereotype that women express more emotion than men both in general and in relationships. It also supports the idea that men are less expressive than women and tend to be more defensive minded in conversations.

Six short self-report measures were used to assess several component communication skills (Gottman 1999). Specifically, the questionnaires assessed Repair Attempts, Accepting Influence, Harsh Start-Up, Flooding, Gridlock, and the Four Horsemen. These six measures were chosen because they were of theoretical and clinical interest to the authors, incorporated both adaptive and maladaptive communication behaviors, and included those aspects of couple communication considered by many to be most toxic, including withdrawal and contempt (Gottman 1999; Gottman et al. 1998; Johnson 2003). Finally, the Four Horsemen create a cascading sequence of responses in which one partner expresses criticism and the other partner responds with defensiveness, causing the first partner to react to the defensiveness with contempt, sarcasm, and/or hostility with their partner, eventually withdrawing from, or stonewalling, the conversation. This cascading negative sequence which occurs as a repetitive, interlocking pattern is believed to signify a critical end-stage process of relationship dissolution, representing a final common causal pathway to relationship dissolution (see Gottman 1994).

In the book &quot;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking&quot;, author Malcolm Gladwell discusses John Gottman&#x27;s theories of how to predict which couples will stay married. Gottman&#x27;s theory states that there are four major emotional reactions that are destructive to a marriage: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most destructive of them all. For all other forms of aggression the Four Horsemen emerged as significant predictors of classification, which is expected given that this construct includes very negative, contemptuous behaviors. This is consistent with marital research, which contends that these communication behaviors are highly toxic, and erode relationship satisfaction (Cornelius et al. 2007; Gottman 1999).

===Power and distance===

People are likely to feel contempt towards a person perceived as low-status who is at a distant proximity, with other emotions resulting from different combinations of power and distance.

<doc id="918990" wikidata="Q96574177" url="?curid=918990" title="Levitated Dipole Experiment">
<text>The Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX) was an experiment investigating the generation of fusion power using the concept of a levitated dipole. The device was the first of its kind to test the levitated dipole concept and was funded by the US Department of Energy. The machine was also part of a collaboration between the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center and Columbia University, where another (non-levitated) dipole experiment, the Collisionless Terrella Experiment (CTX), was located.

LDX ceased operations in November 2011 when its funding from the Department of Energy ended as resources were being diverted to tokamak research.

== Concept and development ==

The concept of the levitated dipole as a fusion reactor was first theorized by Akira Hasegawa in 1987. The concept was later proposed as an experiment by Jay Kesner of MIT and Michael Mauel of Columbia University in 1997. The pair assembled a team and raised money to build the machine. They achieved first plasma on Friday, August 13, 2004, at 12:53 PM. First plasma was done by (1) successfully levitating the dipole magnet and (2) RF heating the plasma. The LDX team has since successfully conducted several levitation tests, including a 40-minute suspension of the superconducting coil on February 9, 2007. Shortly after, the coil was damaged in a control test in February 2007 and replaced in May 2007. The replacement coil was inferior, a copper wound electromagnet, that was also water cooled. Scientific results, including the observation of an inward turbulent pinch, were reported in Nature Physics.

== Machine description ==
=== Dipole ===
This experiment needed a special free-floating electromagnet, which created the unique &quot;toilet-bowl&quot; magnetic field. 
The magnetic field was originally made of three coils. 
Each coil contained a 19-strand niobium-tin Rutherford cable (common in low-temperature superconducting magnets). 
These looped around inside an inconel structure; creating a magnet that looked like an oversized donut. 
The donut was charged using induction. 
Once charged, it generated a magnetic field for roughly an 8-hour period. Overall, the ring weighed 560 kilograms and levitated 1.6 meters above a superconducting ring. 
The ring produced a 5.7 T peak field. 
This superconductor was encased inside a liquid helium cryostat, which kept the electromagnet below 10 kelvins. 
This design is similar to the D20 dipole experiment at Berkeley and the RT-1 experiment at the University of Tokyo.

=== Chamber ===
The dipole was suspended inside a &quot;squashed-pumpkin&quot;-shaped vacuum chamber, which was about 5.2 meters in diameter and ~3 meters high. At the base of the chamber was a charging coil. This coil is used to charge the dipole, using induction. Next, the dipole is raised into the center of the chamber using a launcher-rather system running through the bore of the dipole magnet. A copper magnet fixed on top of the chamber produced a magnetic field which attracted the floating dipole magnet. This external field would interact with the dipole field, suspending the dipole. The magnetic field produce by the floating dipole magnet is used to confine the plasma. The plasma forms around the dipole and inside the chamber. The plasma is formed by heating a low pressure gas using a radio frequency, essentially microwaving the plasma in a ~15-kilowatt field.

=== Diagnostics ===

The machine was monitored using diagnostics fairly standard to all of fusion. These included: 
# A flux loop. This is a loop of wire. The magnetic field passes through the wire loop. As the field varied inside the loop, it generated a current. This was measured and from the signal the magnetic flux was measured. 
# An X-ray detector. This diagnostic measured the X-rays emitted. From this, the plasmas&#x27; temperature was found. There were four of these inside the machine, each measuring along a cord (or line out) inside the machine. This detector was good for measuring electrons, typically around 100 electron-volts. All plasma loses energy by emitting light. This covers the whole spectrum: visible, IR, UV, and X-rays. This occurs anytime a particle changes speed, for any reason. If the reason is deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is Cyclotron radiation at low speeds and Synchrotron radiation at high speeds. If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as Bremsstrahlung radiation.
# An X-ray camera. This can read lower energy X-rays. 
# A conventional video camera 
# An emissive Langmuir probe. A Langmuir probe is a wire, stuck into a plasma, which absorbs the surrounding charged particles. You can vary the voltage on this wire. As the voltage changes, the charged particles absorbed change, making an IV curve. This can be read and used to measure the density and temperature of the nearby plasma. 
# A triple Langmuir probe
# A dozen Langmuir probes grouped together

== Behavior ==

The plasma is confined by the dipole magnetic field. 
Single particles corkscrew along the field lines of the dipole magnet at the cyclotron resonance frequency while completing poloidal orbits. 
The electron population was shown to have a peaked pressure and density profile as a result of the turbulent pinch phenomenon.

=== Modes of Operation ===
There were two modes of operation observed: 
# Hot electron interchange: a lower density, mostly electron plasma, occurring when the dipole was operated in &quot;supported&quot; mode (not levitated).
# A more conventional Magnetohydrodynamic mode.
These had been proposed by Nicholas Krall in the 1960s.

=== Tritium Suppression ===
In the case of deuterium fusion (the cheapest and most straightforward fusion fuel) the geometry of the LDX has the unique advantage over other concepts. Deuterium fusion makes two products, that occur with near equal probability:

:&lt;chem&gt;D + D -&gt; T + ^1H&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;D + D -&gt; ^3He + n&lt;/chem&gt;

In this machine, the secondary tritium could be partially removed, a unique property of the dipole. Another fuel choice is tritium and deuterium. This reaction can be done at lower heats and pressures. But it has several drawbacks. First, tritium is far more expensive than deuterium. This is because tritium is rare. It has a short half-life making it hard to produce and store. It is also considered a hazardous material, increasing difficulties with storage and handling. Finally, tritium and deuterium produces fast neutrons which means any reactor burning it would require heavy radiation shielding for its magnets. As the floating dipole magnet cannot have services (such as cooling) connected from the outside world, this makes thermal management of the floating magnet much harder in a D-T machine.

<doc id="919000" wikidata="Q924432" url="?curid=919000" title="Peace and Truce of God">
<text>The Peace and Truce of God () was a movement in the Middle Ages led by the Catholic Church and was one of the most influential mass peace movements in history. The goal of both the &quot;Pax Dei&quot; and the &quot;Treuga Dei&quot; was to limit the violence of feuding in the western half of the former Carolingian Empire – following its collapse in the middle of the 9th century – using the threat of spiritual sanctions. The eastern half of the former Carolingian Empire did not experience the same collapse of central authority, and neither did England. This movement was also marked by popular participation, with many commoners supporting the movement as a solution to the famines, violence, and collapse of the social order around them.

The Peace of God was first proclaimed in 989, at the Council of Charroux. It sought to protect ecclesiastical property, agricultural resources and unarmed clerics. The Truce of God, first proclaimed in 1027 at the Council of Toulouges, attempted to limit the days of the week and times of year that the nobility engaged in violence. The movement persisted in some form until the thirteenth century.

Other strategies to deal with the problem of violence in the western half of the former Carolingian Empire included the code of chivalry.

==Background==
Christian laws regarding violence had evolved from the earlier concept of Pax Romana.

There was an ecclesiastical discussion of peace for secular authorities as early as 494, in a letter from Pope Gelasius I to Emperor Anastasius, in which he suggested that kings listen to religious authorities before making their judgments. As early as 697, Adomnán of Iona promulgated the Cáin Adomnáin, which provided sanctions against the killing of children, clerics, clerical students and peasants on clerical lands.

Other ecclesiastical measures to protect church property were also observed from the tenth to the eleventh centuries, as evidenced by the Council of Trosly, which explicitly designated the destruction of church property as sacrilege. The controversy flourished in the eleventh century, when secular violence from private wars and personal feuds began to threaten both church buildings and monastic communities throughout Europe.

==History==
The Peace of God was first proclaimed in 989 at the Council of Charroux. It sought to protect ecclesiastical property, agricultural resources, and unarmed clerics. After the collapse of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth century, the areas formerly under its control degenerated into many small counties and lordships, in which local lords and knights frequently fought each other for control. The West Frankish nobility benefited from the Carolingian accession and introduced the Capetian, further transforming medieval European society. One of the critical points of this dynastic change is what Guy Bois calls &quot;the mutation of the year 1000,&quot; the period being known for its relentless combination of chaos and creativity. Frederick S. Paxton argues that the political and cultural landscape of this period highlights some of the prevailing cultural anxieties and problems around the turn of the millennium, particularly the &quot;unprecedented disorder in governmental, legal, and social institutions.&quot; Carolingian society faced a &quot;king incapable of action and a nobility unwilling to act, which led the French people, imbued with a &#x27;national spirit&#x27; that was particularly creative in combating political and social ills, to turn to spiritual sanctions as the only available means of limiting violence.&quot;

While some historians postulate that the Peace of God and Truce of God movements stem from the inability or unwillingness of the highest echelons of Carolingian society to contain the violence and feuds among the Capetian nobles, other scholars argue that a Castellan revolution in the Frankish kingdoms contributed to the problem. According to André Debord, the Peace and Truce movement arose in response to the social and political upheavals resulting from the rapid growth of castle building in the early eleventh century, particularly in Aquitaine. The chaos of the era is attributed to the problem of violent feuds, with castellans and their militias working toward consolidated power and freedom from the overarching political structure of the Carolingian Empire.

By 1030, at the same time that William V, Duke of Aquitaine, William IV of Provence, and Ademar of Chabannes died, county power was overwhelming in Charente. During this period, the county power of dukes and counts was changing, for the building of castles was an inherent consolidation of power. At the same time, &quot;those who possessed county castles had a marked tendency to disobey as soon as the count or duke turned his back on them,&quot; so that figures who possessed little traditional power, such as Hugh the Chiliarc, &quot;could cause the most serious trouble to the distinguished duke of Aquitaine.&quot;

There were often attacks from the Vikings in this period, who settled in northern areas (the Normans) but continued to raid territory further inland.

The two movements began at different times and places, but by the eleventh century they became synonymous as &quot;Peace and Truce of God&quot;. The Germans looked on French &#x27;anarchy&#x27; with a mixture of horror and contempt. To preserve the king&#x27;s peace was the first duty of a German sovereign.&quot; The movement, though seemingly redundant to the duties of the crown, had a religious momentum that would not be denied. Holy Roman Emperor Henry III issued the earliest form of this in his empire while at Constance in 1043. Some scholars connect it to the subsequent concept of &quot;Landfriede&quot; in the Holy Roman Empire, although others suggest &quot;Landfriede&quot; existed alongside or prior to these movements.

==Peace of God==
The Peace of God or Pax Dei was a proclamation of the local clergy that granted immunity from violence to noncombatants who could not defend themselves, starting with the peasants (agricolae) and the clergy. The Synod of Charroux decreed a limited &quot;Pax Dei&quot; in 989, and the practice spread to most of Western Europe over the next century, surviving in some form until at least the thirteenth century.

Under the Peace of God are included:
* consecrated persons — clerics, monks, virgins, and cloistered widows;
* consecrated places — churches, monasteries, and cemeteries, with their dependencies;
* consecrated times — Sundays, and ferial days, all under the special protection of the Church, which punishes transgressors with excommunication.

At an early date the councils extended the Peace of God to the Church&#x27;s protégés, the poor, pilgrims, crusaders, and even merchants on a journey. The peace of the sanctuary gave rise to the right of asylum.

=== Popular Participation ===
At the Benedictine abbey of Charroux in La Marche on the borders of the Aquitaine &quot;a great crowd of many people (&quot;populus&quot;) gathered there from the Poitou, the Limousin, and neighbouring regions. Many bodies of saints were also brought there &quot;bringing miracles in their wake&quot;. Three canons promulgated at Charroux, under the leadership of Gombald Archbishop of Bordeaux and Gascony, were signed by the bishops of Poitiers, Limoges, Périgueux, Saintes and Angoulême, all in the west of France beyond the limited jurisdiction of King Hugh Capet. Excommunication would be the punishment for attacking or robbing a church, for robbing peasants or the poor of farm animals – among which the donkey is mentioned, but not the horse (an item beyond the reach of a peasant) – and for robbing, striking or seizing a priest or any man of the clergy &quot;who is not bearing arms&quot;. Making compensation or reparations could circumvent the anathema of the Church.

Children and women (virgins and widows) were added to the early protections. The &quot;Pax Dei&quot; prohibited nobles from invading churches, from beating the defenceless, from burning houses, and so on. A synod of 1033 added merchants and their goods to the protected list. Significantly, the Peace of God movement began in Aquitaine, Burgundy and Languedoc, areas where central authority had most completely fragmented.

The participation of large, enthusiastic crowds marked the phenomenon of Pax Dei as one of the first popular religious movements of the Middle Ages. In the initial phase, the mixture of relics, crowds and enthusiasm characterized the movement with an exceptionally popular character.

After a lull in the first two decades of the eleventh century, the movement spread to the north of France with the support of king Robert II of France (reigned 996–1031). There, the high nobility sponsored Peace assemblies throughout Flanders, Burgundy, Champagne, Normandy, the Amiénois, and Berry. The oaths to keep the peace sworn by nobles spread in time to the villagers themselves; heads of households meeting communally would ritually swear to uphold the common peace.

The tenth-century foundation of the Cluny Abbey in Burgundy aided the development of the Peace of God. Cluny was independent of any secular authority, subject to the Papacy alone, and while all church territory was inviolate, Cluny&#x27;s territory extended far beyond its own boundaries. A piece of land 30 km in diameter was considered to be part of Cluny itself, and any smaller monastery that allied itself with Cluny was granted the same protection from violence. A Peace of God council gave this grant in Anse in 994. The monastery was also immune from excommunications, interdicts, and anathemas, which would normally affect an entire region. Fleury Abbey was granted similar protection. Many Cluniac monks came from the same knightly class whose violence they were trying to stop.

The movement was not very effective. However it set a precedent that would be followed by other successful popular movements to control nobles&#x27; violence such as medieval communes.

The phrase &quot;Peace of God&quot; also occurs as a general term meaning &quot;under the protection of the Church&quot; and was used in various contexts in medieval society. Pilgrims traveling on crusades, for example, did so under the &quot;peace of God,&quot; that is, under the protection of the Church. This general use of the term does not always refer to the &quot;Peace and Truce of God&quot; movement.

Georges Duby summarised the widening social repercussions of &quot;Pax Dei&quot;:

==== The Limousin Peace of God ====
A subset of the movement is known as the Limousin Peace of God (994–1032/3). The most important source documenting the Limousin movement is the contemporary writer Ademar of Chabannes (989–1034). Ademar is a monk of Saint-Eparchius of Angoulême, who spent time at Saint-Martial in Limoges and was a historian, liturgist, grammarian, and artist. The Limousin Peace of God movement is generally regarded as largely fictitious, for Ademar seems to have created a fiction about the actual development of the Peace of God in Aquitaine. One of the points that Richard Landes and other historians have established is that there was a Peace of God movement in Aquitaine, as Rodulphus Glaber, writing about the peace councils in Francia in 1033, stated that the movement began in Aquitaine.

One of the most important points in Landes&#x27; historiographical study of the early councils of Limoges is the fact that ecclesiastical authorities encouraged cultural and religious enthusiasm within council activities in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. Landes, known for his work on apocalyptic currents of thought around the year 1000, argues that conciliar activities in Limoges and other areas of Aquitaine are crucial to understanding the role of the God&#x27;s Peace movement as a whole because of the combination of apocalyptic attitudes toward the end of the tenth century and the popularity of penitential practices for natural and man-made disasters. In the case of Limoges, there was a major outbreak of a &quot;&#x27;plague of plagues,&#x27; probably ergotism&quot; and &quot;the abbot and the bishop (brothers of the viscount), in consultation with the duke of Aquitaine, called for a three-day fast, during which relics from all over the world would come to Limoges.&quot;

==== The Cult of Saints and the Importance of Relics ====
In general, one of the reasons for the large popular participation in the Peace of God movement throughout Europe was the popularity of relics and the penitential practices associated with the cult of saints. In the case of Limoges, the cult of Saint Martial is prominent, as miracles were attested to his shrine during the Peace Council of 994. The narrative from the Vita prolixior s. Martialis is directly related to the ideals of peace:

Relics and the cults of saints were also important in the Peace of God movement in Hainaut. During the rebellion of Godfrey III against Holy Roman Emperor Henry III (1047–56), Lobbes Abbey was ravaged and had to be rebuilt, so the abbot decided to take the relics of the abbey&#x27;s founder, Saint Ursmar, on a tour (&quot;delatio&quot;) through Flanders, starting in 1060, in order to convince Count Baldwin V to restore the abbey&#x27;s Flemish estates (and possibly to collect gifts from the faithful along the way). Performing many supposed miracles along the way, and ending feuds between many different types of people, this tour helped Pope Urban II&#x27;s declaration of the Truce of God in 1095 become implemented in Flanders and its surrounding area more quickly.

==Truce of God==
The Truce of God or &quot;Treuga Dei&quot; had its origin in Normandy in the city of Caen. It dates from the eleventh century. Proclaimed in 1027 at the Council of Toulouges, the bishops attempted to limit the days of the week and times of year that the nobility engaged in violence.

While the Truce of God is a temporary suspension of hostilities, as opposed to the Peace of God, the scope of the truce of God is broader. The Truce of God prohibited fighting on Sundays and Feria (feast days when people did not have to work). It was the sanctification of Sunday that led to the Truce of God, because it had always been agreed not to fight on that day and to suspend disputes in the courts.

It confirmed permanent peace for all churches and their grounds, the monks, clerks and chattels; all women, pilgrims, merchants and their servants, cattle and horses; and men at work in the fields. For all others peace was required throughout Advent, the season of Lent, and from the beginning of the Rogation days until eight days after Pentecost. This prohibition was later extended to certain days of the week, namely Thursday, commemorating the Ascension, Friday, the day of the Passion, and Saturday, the day of the Resurrection (Council 1041). In the middle of the twelfth century, the number of days prescribed was extended until there were about eighty days left for fighting.

The Truce soon spread from France to Italy and Germany; the 1179 Third Council of the Lateran extended the institution to the whole Church by Canon xxi, &quot;De treugis servandis&quot;, which was inserted in the collection of canon law, Decretal of Gregory IX, I, tit., &quot;De treuga et pace&quot;. Aquinas challenged the Truce, holding that it was lawful to wage war to safeguard the commonwealth on holy days and feast days.

==Peace of God and Truce of God and chivalry and crusades==

One of the interesting developments that began at the end of the tenth century and continued well into the eleventh century is the rhetoric of God&#x27;s Peace and God&#x27;s Peace movements within chivalric vows and as a way to divert chivalric violence from one&#x27;s country. While the God&#x27;s Peace and God&#x27;s Peace movements must be considered as developing separately in Europe, in terms of the role of these movements in war and in civil society, there are instances where the rhetoric of the movements is combined in oaths and speeches by both secular and ecclesiastical leaders, such as the secular leader Robert the Pious (996-1031).

The oath is important because it shows that the secular powers are now willing to obey the ecclesiastical powers and rein in problematic knights and armies. Furthermore, chivalric and warlike violence is often undermined by the ecclesiastical powers through the use of crusades. For Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095, subverting martial violence is an effective means against secular violence:

The Peace of God and the Truce of God thus moved in the rhetorical landscape of subverting violence by redirecting it to more appropriate areas, such as a crusade in the Middle East against Islam to recapture Jerusalem.

==Other developments==
From the 11th century on, knighthood developed a religious character. Aspiring knights underwent strict religious rituals to be initiated. An initiate had to fast, confess his sins, take a symbolic bath, have his hair cut to represent humility, and spend a night in prayer while his weapons lay on an altar symbolizing the dedication of his arms to the Church and God. Advances in metallurgy made it possible to engrave inscriptions and images of sacred symbols on helmets, swords, shields, the saddle and bridle of a horse. Relics and items with religious symbols, often of saints, were routinely carried into battle by knights in the Middle Ages. The symbols reminded the knights and soldiers that God supported their efforts and offered the soldiers protection and the assurance of victory over their enemies.

In addition to the Peace and Truce of God movement, the clergy used other nonviolent, though less direct, methods of controlling violence. By adding the religious oath of fealty to the feudal act of homage and by organizing rights and duties within the system, churchmen did their utmost to civilize feudal society in general and to set limits on feudal violence in particular.

Louis IX of France was famous for his attention to settling disputes and keeping the peace, at least within the Kingdom of France. He issued the first surviving decree prohibiting warfare in France indefinitely. This text, dated January 1258, forbade guerre omnes as well as arson and disturbance of wagons and agricolae working with wagons or plows. Those who violated this prohibition were to be punished as peacebreakers (fractores pacis) by the king&#x27;s officer and the elected bishop of le Puy-en-Velay. Louis IX promulgated this text as a simple royal act based on his authority as king.

The Bianchi were a religious movement that swept through Italy for several months in 1399. Tens of thousands of men, women, and children crisscrossed the country praying and advocating for peace. It was a shock to many observers, and the authorities were unprepared. It also brought peace, at least for a few months, to much of Italy.

<text>Swing Time is a 1936 American musical comedy film, the sixth of ten starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Directed by George Stevens for RKO, it features Helen Broderick, Victor Moore, Betty Furness, Eric Blore and Georges Metaxa, with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Dorothy Fields. Set mainly in New York City, the film follows a gambler and dancer, &quot;Lucky&quot; (Astaire), who is trying to raise money to secure his marriage when he meets a dance instructor, Penny (Rogers), and begins dancing with her; the two soon fall in love and are forced to reconcile their feelings.

Noted dance critic Arlene Croce considers &quot;Swing Time&quot; to be Astaire and Rogers&#x27;s best dance musical, a view shared by John Mueller and Hannah Hyam. It features four dance routines that are each regarded as masterpieces. According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to the American Musical&quot;, &quot;Swing Time&quot; is &quot;a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals&quot;. &quot;The Oxford Companion&quot; says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it &quot;left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. ... Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s.&quot; &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot; is often singled out as the partnership&#x27;s and collaborator Hermes Pan&#x27;s most profound achievement in filmed dance, while &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Astaire topped the U.S. pop chart with it in 1936. Jerome Kern&#x27;s score, the first of two that he composed specially for Astaire films, contains three of his most memorable songs.

The film&#x27;s plot has been criticized, though, as has the performance of Metaxa. More praised is Rogers&#x27;s acting and dancing performance. Rogers credited much of the film&#x27;s success to Stevens: &quot;He gave us a certain quality, I think, that made it stand out above the others.&quot; &quot;Swing Time&quot; also marked the beginning of a decline in popularity of the Astaire–Rogers partnership among the general public, with box-office receipts falling faster than usual after a successful opening. Nevertheless, the film was a sizable hit, costing $886,000, grossing over $2,600,000 worldwide, and showing a net profit of $830,000. The partnership never regained the creative heights scaled in this and previous films.

In 1999, &quot;Swing Time&quot; was listed as one of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s top 100 films. In 2004, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition), it is ranked at No. 90.

==Plot==
John &quot;Lucky&quot; Garnett is a gambler and dancer who is ready to marry Margaret Watson. Not wanting him to retire, the other members of his dance act deliberately sabotage the event. &quot;Pop&quot; Cardetti takes Lucky&#x27;s trousers to be altered by sewing cuffs, while the others begin a crap game. After the tailor refuses to modify the pants, Pop returns with them, unaltered. Margaret&#x27;s father phones to say that he has sent everyone home, but the call is intercepted. When Lucky finally leaves for the wedding, his troupe bets the bankroll that he will not get married. Lucky mollifies Margaret&#x27;s father by saying that he was &quot;earning&quot; $200. Judge Watson tells Lucky that he must earn $25,000 to demonstrate his good intentions.

At the train station, Lucky&#x27;s dance troupe takes all of his money, except for his lucky quarter because he did not get married. Pop and Lucky board the first freight train to New York. Lucky meets Penny when he asks for change for his lucky quarter, so that he can buy cigarettes for Pop. The cigarette machine dumps a load of coins, so they follow Penny and offer to repurchase the quarter, but she is in no mood to deal with them. Pop sneaks the quarter out of her purse when she drops her things, but she thinks that Lucky did it. Lucky insists on following Penny to her job as a dance school instructor. He accepts a dancing lesson from her agency to apologize. After a disastrous lesson (&quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot;), Penny tells him to &quot;save his money&quot;. Her boss, Mr. Gordon, overhears and fires her. He also fires Mabel Anderson for complaining that Pop ate her sandwich. Lucky dances with Penny to prove how much that she has taught him. Gordon gives Penny back her job, and sets up an audition with the owner of the Silver Sandal nightclub.

Lucky and Pop check into the hotel where Penny and Mabel live. Lucky fails to win a tuxedo for the audition by playing strip piquet. They miss the audition, and Penny gets mad at Lucky again. He and Pop picket in front of Penny&#x27;s apartment door for a week. Mabel intervenes, and Penny forgives him, agreeing to a second audition. At the Silver Sandal, bandleader Ricardo Romero, who wants to marry Penny, refuses to play for them. The club owner cannot force him because he lost Romero&#x27;s contract in a bet with Club Raymond. At the casino, Pop warns Lucky that he is about to win enough money to marry Margaret. He takes his bet off the table. The club owner wagers Ricardo&#x27;s contract on a cut of the cards. Seeing that Raymond intends to cheat, Pop cheats too, and Lucky wins the contract.

Lucky and Penny are dance partners, but he avoids seeing her alone. He lacks the nerve to tell her about Margaret. Mabel arranges a trip to the country. Lucky resists the temptation to snuggle in a snow-covered gazebo, prompting &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;. Pop lets the truth slip about Margaret. In the remodeled Silver Sandal, Penny refuses another proposal from Ricardo. Mabel dares her to give Lucky &quot;a great big kiss&quot;. They do kiss behind a dressing room door. Pop lets his sleight of hand become known to Raymond, who insists on competing with Lucky for the contract. He loses. Margaret arrives, and Lucky asks her to meet him the next day. While Lucky is indecisive, Penny becomes heartbroken. Lucky finds her in the deserted club, where he learns that she has agreed to marry Ricardo. Asked about the future, he sings &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot;, segueing without dialogue into their dance to &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;.

The next day, Margaret tells Lucky that she wants to marry someone else. Everyone laughs until Pop announces that Ricardo and Penny will be married that afternoon. They rush to intervene and manage to pull off the trouser gag. While waiting for the nonexistent alteration, Ricardo struggles to keep up a pair of baggy pants. An infectious round of laughter causes Penny to call off the wedding, having been wooed by Lucky.

==Production==
Initially, the working titles for the film were &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance&quot; and &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot;, but studio executives worried that no one would come see a musical in which no one danced, so the title was changed. &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot; was also considered as a title, as were 15 other possibilities.

Erwin Gelsey&#x27;s original screen story was purchased by RKO and, in November 1935, Gelsey was hired to adapt the story. Although he did not receive any screen credit, he was under consideration for screenplay credit as late as July 1936. Howard Lindsay wrote the first draft of the screenplay, which was considerably rewritten by Allan Scott. Before shooting started in April 1936, Scott was called back from New York to write additional dialogue.

Astaire spent almost eight weeks preparing for the film&#x27;s dance numbers.

The &quot;Bojangles of Harlem&quot; number, a tribute to Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, was the last part of the film to be shot, because of the special effects required. To create the effect that Astaire was dancing with three shadows of himself that were larger-than-life, Astaire had to be filmed dancing in front of a blank white screen on which a powerful light projected his shadow. This footage was tripled in the film lab. Next, Astaire was filmed performing under normal lighting in front of another white screen while watching a projection of the dancing shadow, and the four shots were optically combined. In its entirety, the sequence took three full days of shooting; the whole film took several weeks longer to shoot than the normal Astaire–Rogers film.

The New York street scenes were shot on Paramount&#x27;s back lot, the train station interiors and exteriors at the Los Angeles Santa Fe Railroad Station, and the freight yard scene was shot in downtown Los Angeles.

The car used during the &quot;New Amsterdam Inn&quot; number is a 1935 Auburn 851 Phaeton Sedan.

== Musical numbers ==

* &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot;: The first of Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields&#x27;s standards is a polka sung and danced by Astaire and Rogers. It is also a technical tour-de-force, with the basic polka embellished by syncopated rhythms, and overlaid with tap decoration. In particular, Rogers recaptures the spontaneity and commitment that she first displayed in the &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Hard to Handle&quot; number from &quot;Roberta&quot;; that film&#x27;s score was originally written by Kern for the Broadway stage.
* &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;: Kern and Fields&#x27;s Oscar-winning foxtrot is sung by Astaire, seated at a piano, while Ginger is busy washing her hair in a side room. Astaire conveys a sunny yet nostalgic romanticism, but later, when they dance to &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot;, the pair will create a mood of sombre poignancy. As evidence of its enduring appeal, the song has been featured in modern cinema and television. It is featured in the films &quot;Chinatown&quot; and &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, and it plays a prominent role as an important element in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; series finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;.
* &quot;Waltz in Swing Time&quot;: Described by one critic as &quot;the finest piece of pure dance music ever written for Astaire&quot;, this is the most virtuosic partnered romantic duet Astaire ever committed to film. Kern was always reluctant to compose in the swing style, so the film&#x27;s orchestrator, Robert Russell Bennett — a longtime Kern associate on Broadway — composed the number using some themes provided by Kern. The song&#x27;s interlude, a ¾ treatment of &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, was added by rehearsal pianist Hal Borne. Bennett recalled Kern&#x27;s request to attend to the number (&quot;see what Freddie [Astaire] wants&quot;) to Arlene Croce in 1976, and later in a letter to John Mueller; the published sheet music notes that the waltz was &quot;constructed and arranged&quot; by Bennett. The dance is a nostalgic celebration of love, in the form of a syncopated waltz with tap overlays — a concept that Astaire would rework in the &quot;Belle of New York&quot; segment of the &quot;Currier and Ives&quot; routine from &quot;The Belle of New York&quot;. In the midst of this complex routine, Astaire and Rogers find time to gently poke fun at notions of elegance, in a reminder of a similar episode in &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot;.
* &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;: Kern and Fields&#x27;s third standard, a quickstep to Fields&#x27;s bittersweet lyrics, is sung alternately by Rogers and Astaire, with Rogers providing an object lesson in acting while a bowler-hatted Astaire at times appears to be impersonating Stan Laurel. Never a man to discard a favorite piece of fine clothing, Astaire wears the same coat in the opening scene of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;.
* &quot;Bojangles of Harlem&quot;: Kern, Bennett and Borne combined their talents to produce a jaunty instrumental piece ideally suited to Astaire, who here — while overtly paying tribute to Bill Robinson — actually broadens his tribute to African-American tap dancers by dancing in the style of Astaire&#x27;s one-time teacher, John W. Bubbles, and dressing in the style of the character, &quot;Sportin&#x27; Life&quot;, a role that Bubbles played in Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Dorothy Fields recounted how Astaire managed to inspire the reluctant Kern by visiting his home and singing while dancing on and around his furniture. It is the only number in which Astaire — again bowler-hatted — appears in blackface. The idea of using trick photography to show Astaire dancing with three of his shadows was invented by Hermes Pan(who also choreographed the opening chorus), after which Astaire dances a short opening solo that features poses mimicking and satirizing Al Jolson, all of which was captured by Stevens in one take. A two-minute solo follows, with Astaire dancing with his shadows; it took three days to shoot. Astaire&#x27;s choreography exercises every limb, and makes extensive use of hand-clappers. Hermes Pan earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Dance Direction.
* &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot;: After Astaire sings Fields&#x27;s closing line of Kern&#x27;s haunting ballad, they begin the acknowledgement phase of the dance, replete with a poignant nostalgia for their now-doomed affair, in which the music changes to &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, and they dance slowly in a manner reminiscent of the opening part of &quot;Let&#x27;s Face The Music And Dance&quot; from &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot;. At the end of this episode, Astaire adopts a crestfallen, helpless pose. They begin the denial phase, and again the music changes and speeds up, this time to the &quot;Waltz In Swing Time&quot; while the dancers separate to twirl their way up their respective staircases, escaping to the platform at the top of the Silver Sandal Set — an elaborate Art Deco-influenced Hollywood Moderne creation of Carroll Clark and John Harkrider. The music switches to a frantic, fast-paced, recapitulation of &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot; as the pair dance a last, desperate and virtuosic routine before Rogers flees and Astaire repeats his pose of dejection, in a final acceptance of the affair&#x27;s end. This final routine was shot 47 times in one day before Astaire was satisfied, with Rogers&#x27;s feet left bruised and bleeding by the time they finished.
* Finale duet: At the end of the film, Astaire and Rogers sing shortened versions of &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; and &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; simultaneously (with altered lyrics). Harmonies were slightly altered so that the two songs fit well together.

Musical notes
* Kern and Fields also wrote an additional song, &quot;It&#x27;s Not in the Cards&quot;, as a full opening number, but it was cut, heard only momentarily at the conclusion of the first scene, and later as background music.
* Kern was hired to write seven songs, for which he was paid $50,000 and a gross percentage up to $37,500. Astaire requested that two of the songs be swing numbers, but the weak version of &quot;Bojangles of Harlem&quot; that he delivered remained unacceptable, despite Astaire having spent several hours tap-dancing in Kern&#x27;s hotel room in an attempt to loosen it up. Kern required the services of Robert Russell Bennet, and, during rehearsal, Astaire&#x27;s rehearsal pianist, Hal Borne, contributed ideas. Although Astaire requested that Borne receive credit for his contribution, Kern was insistent that Borne receive no credit, was not to compose any music, and was not to be paid for writing any music. Bennett also received no credit in the film, but the sheet music for &quot;Waltz in Swing Time&quot; credits him with the construction and arrangement.

==Reception==

===Box office===
According to RKO records, the film made $1,624,000 in the U.S. and Canada, and $994,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $830,000.

It was the 15th most popular film at the British box office in 1935–1936.

===Critical response===

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.58/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire are brilliant in &quot;Swing Time&quot;, one of the duo&#x27;s most charming and wonderfully choreographed films.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 91 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

* &quot;American Dancer&quot;, November 1936: &quot;Astaire&#x27;s dancing can no longer be classified as mere tap, because it is such a perfect blend of tap, modern and ballet, with a generous share of Astaire&#x27;s personality and good humor... Rogers is vastly improved... but she cannot, as yet, vie with Astaire&#x27;s amazing agility, superb grace and sophisticated charm. With Astaire one feels, with each succeeding picture, that surely his dancing has reached perfection and marks the end of invention of new steps: and yet he seems to go forward with ease and apparent nonchalance.&quot;
* &quot;Dance Magazine&quot;, November 1936, by Joseph Arnold Kaye: &quot;Much has been written about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in &quot;Swing Time&quot; except, perhaps, one thing: Astaire and Rogers are the picture; everything else seems to have been put in to fill the time between swings. Dance routines are fresh and interesting, dance is superb. When Hollywood will learn to make a dance picture as good as the dancing, we cannot even guess.&quot;
* &quot;Variety&quot;, September 2, 1936, by Abel: &quot;Perhaps a shade under previous par, but it&#x27;s another box-office and personal winner from the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers combo... Film&#x27;s 103 minutes running time could have been pared to advantage but &quot;Swing Time&quot; will swing &#x27;em past the wickets in above-average tempo.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
At the 1937 Academy Awards, Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields won the award for Best Music, Original Song, and Hermes Pan was nominated but did not win for his choreography for &quot;Bojangles of Harlem&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Swing Time&quot; as one of the top 100 films, and in 2004, the film was included in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked &quot;Swing Time&quot; at No. 90 on their 10th anniversary list of 100 Years...100 Movies.

==Adaptations==
A Broadway musical based on the film, &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot;, used much of Kern and Fields&#x27;s original score. The show, which had a book by Jeffrey Hatcher, began performances on October 27, 2003, running for 44 previews and 84 performances. It opened on December 4, 2003, and closed on February 15, 2004. It was directed by Michael Greif and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell.

==Allusions in other works==
The film lends its title to Zadie Smith&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;Swing Time&quot;, in which it is a recurring plot device.

<text>Beijing Zoo is a zoological park in Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing. Founded in 1906 during the late Qing dynasty, it is the oldest zoo in China and oldest public park in northern China. The zoo is also a center of zoological research that studies and breeds rare animals from various continents.

The zoo occupies an area of , including of lakes and ponds in Xicheng District. It has one of the largest animal collections in the country. In 2015, the zoo and its aquarium had over 450 species of land animals and over 500 species of marine animals; in all, it is home to 14,500 animals.

More than five million people visit the zoo each year. Like many of Beijing&#x27;s parks, the zoo&#x27;s grounds resemble classical Chinese gardens, with flower beds amidst natural scenery, including dense groves of trees, stretches of meadows, small streams and rivers, lotus pools, and hills dotted with pavilions and historical buildings.

The Beijing Zoo is well known for its collection of rare animals endemic to China including the giant pandas, which are zoo&#x27;s most popular animals, the red panda (&quot;Ailurus fulgens&quot;), native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China, the golden snub-nosed monkey, South China tiger, white-lipped deer, Pere David&#x27;s deer, crested ibis, Chinese alligator, and Chinese giant salamander. Other endangered or threatened species housed there include a Siberian tiger, yak, Przewalski&#x27;s horse, snow leopard, Tibetan gazelle, and kiang. The zoo also has a broad collection of megafauna such as addax, Asian black bears, Asian and African elephants, bats, beluga whales, chimpanzees, clouded leopards, flamingos, gorillas, hippopotamuses, jaguars, kangaroos, lemurs, lions, muntjac, otters, penguins, polar bears, rhinoceroses, sea turtles, tapirs, giraffes and zebras, as well as 13 of the world&#x27;s 15 species of cranes.

==History==


===Imperial Era===
The zoo grounds originally housed an imperial manor during the Ming dynasty, that became part of the estate of the general Fuk&#x27;anggan during the Qing dynasty. In 1906, the Imperial Ministry for Agricultural, Industry and Commerce established an experimental farm outside of Xizhimen on land that encompassed two gardens, the Leshan and Ji, and two temples, the Guangshan and Huining. The Experimental Farm consisted of an experimental farm, a botantical garden, a small menagerie of . The experimental farm had five main experimental areas for grain, sericulture, vegetables, fruits and flowers. The menagerie was the earliest public zoo in China and the oldest public park in northern China.

Most of the animals were purchased by the Viceroy of Liangjiang, Duanfang, from Germany. The animal collection attracted great interest when the farm opened to visitors on 16 June 1908. Admission cost eight copper coins with children at half price. The Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor each visited the zoo twice. The farm was known as the &quot;Wanshouyuan&quot; or the &quot;Garden of Ten Thousand Beasts.&quot; Among the historical buildings at the zoo is Changguanlou, a Baroque-style country-palace of Empress Dowager Cixi, designed by a French architect and built in 1908. It remains one of the best preserved Western-style palaces in China.

===Republican Era===
After the Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1911, the zoo became a national botanical garden during the Republican period. In the 1930s, with French aid, Lamarck Hall, named after the botanist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, was built at the experimental farm and housed plant research. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese occupiers built the monkey mountain in 1942, but used the experimental farm as a storage depot. In 1943, the Imperial Japanese Army poisoned the zoo&#x27;s six lions and two leopards, purportedly to remove potential interference with air defenses. Many other animals, including the zoo&#x27;s lone Asian elephant, died of starvation. By the end of the war, only ten monkeys, rabbits, geese, two pigeons, flamingo, emu, peacock, eagle, and three parrots remained.

===Early People&#x27;s Republic===
When Beijing became the capital of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, only 13 monkeys, three parrots and an emu blind in one eye remained at the zoo. The city government renamed the zoo the Beijing Agricultural Experimentation Center the Western Suburban Park (西郊公园) and began gradually rebuilding the zoo. In 1952, national leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Ren Bishi donated their war horses to the park.

The zoo sent staff to study zoo management in the Soviet Union and Poland, and began to trade animals with Eastern Bloc countries, Burma, India, Indonesia, and Japan to expand its collection. Zoo staff used some 30 species from the zoo including South China Tiger, François&#x27; langur, Chinese alligator, python and black bear in such trades. The Moscow Zoo and Leipzig Zoo donated 14 species including African lion, polar bear, brown bear, emu and Himalayan vulture. The park was renamed the Beijing Zoo in 1955. Guo Moruo, the renowned writer and president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote the calligraphy for the zoo&#x27;s entrance sign. Leading Chinese universities also established a research presence in the zoo to study animal behavior and to breed endangered species. Giant panda was displayed at the zoo for the first time in 1955 and successfully bred by zoo staff in 1963.

New enclosures opened in the 1950s, the Lion-Tiger Mountain, Elephant House, Primate House, and Reptile House, which had specimens of over 100 species including crocodiles and pythons. In 1958, the city government approved the expansion of the zoo to 21 hectares on the north bank of the Nanchang River. In 1965, when the construction of the Capital Indoor Stadium took away 4 hectares of the zoo&#x27;s land to the west, the city granted the zoo 2.3 hectares near the Ming Tombs north of the city. This land became the zoo&#x27;s off-site breeding center.

The zoo&#x27;s development came to an abrupt halt with the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 as zoo staff were purged, research work stopped, and contacts with foreign zoos were severed. When Guo Moruo was denounced, the sign bearing his calligraphy was removed and replaced with one featuring characters pieced together from Chairman Mao&#x27;s calligraphy.

In the 1970s, as China forged diplomatic relations with the Western bloc, the zoo received animal gifts from the Australia, France, Mexico, Nepal, Spain, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The zoo also organized a four-year mission to Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, which brought back 157 species and 1,000 animals including and aardvark, African elephant, baboon, giant tortoises, giraffe, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, oryx, ostrich, Thomson&#x27;s gazelle, wildebeest, and zebra.

During the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Beijing Zoo sent a pair of giant pandas, Yingxin and Yong Yong, to Los Angeles for an exhibition. In 1987, Yong Yong and Ling Ling went on exhibition at the Bronx Zoo.

==Present==
The buildings in the zoo cover an area of more than 50,000 square meters, including the elephant hall, the lion and tiger hall, the monkey hall, the panda hall, and many others. Altogether, there are more than 30 large halls.

The Beijing Zoo maintains an active breeding program that produced 1,104 surviving offspring of 92 species in 2013 including the critically endangered Northern white-cheeked gibbon and Guizhou snub-nosed monkey. Other reproduced species in 2013 include giant panda, golden takin, chimpanzee, De Brazza&#x27;s monkey, Patas monkey, vervet monkey, mantled guereza, Bengal slow loris, tufted capuchin, Pere David&#x27;s deer and hippopatamus.

Visitors to the zoo can also explore its many Qing dynasty buildings.


==Beijing Aquarium==
The Beijing Aquarium is located within the zoological park, on the northern bank of the Chang River. Opened in 1999, the aquarium complex covers an area of 120,000 square meters, with 42,000 square meters of interior space. It is the biggest aquarium in China with a large number of fish species and marine mammals. Visitors can watch shows performed by dolphins, belugas, and sea lions.

==Location and access==
The Beijing Zoo is located at 137 Xizhimen Wai Dajie in Xicheng District, just west of the northwest corner of the 2nd Ring Road. Outside the zoo is a local public transit hub with Beijing Zoo Station on Line 4 of the Beijing Subway and terminals for Beijing Bus routes 7, 15, 19, 102, and 103. Bus routes 27, 105, 107, 111, 305, 347, 360, 362, 534, 563, 604, 632, 686, 特4, 特19, 夜8 also stop at the zoo.

===Nearby attractions===
The Beijing Planetarium is located diagonally across the street from the zoo&#x27;s main entrance. To the west of the zoo is the Purple Bamboo Park. To the east is the Beijing Exhibition Center and the Moscow Restaurant.

==Controversies==
According to a 2010 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a restaurant located in the Beijing Zoo, named &quot;Bin Feng Tan,&quot; offers various dishes of exotic animals on its menu. The restaurant manager commented that its dishes were within the law, as the animal products were supplied by exotic animal farms. However, the restaurant received a backlash since the news spread. Ge Rui of the International Fund for Animal Welfare describes the restaurant&#x27;s menu and practices as &quot;utterly inappropriate for a zoo&quot; and &quot;socially irresponsible.&quot; Following the negative coverage, the restaurant stated they would be revising the menu.

==In popular culture==
A significant portion of James Rollins&#x27; Sigma Force novel, &quot;The Bone Labyrinth&quot; (2015), takes place in, near, and below the Beijing Zoo. Rollins depicts unsanitary and inhumane conditions at the zoo, and inhumane animal experimentation there. In the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note to Readers: Truth or Fiction&quot;, Rollins writes: &quot;I did visit the Beijing Zoo and found the state of that zoological park to be appalling. The government continues to hint at changes and plans to move the place into a larger zoo outside the city with more modern accommodations. So hopefully now that I&#x27;ve blown it up, they&#x27;ll get on with those plans.&quot;

&quot;Fish and Elephant&quot;, directed by documentary filmmaker and former TV hostess Li Yu, is based within the zoo. The film is often referred to as the first Chinese mainland film to broach the topic of lesbian relationships in China.

<doc id="919013" wikidata="Q232170" url="?curid=919013" title="Two for the Road (film)">
<text>Two for the Road is a 1967 romantic comedy-drama directed and produced by Stanley Donen, starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney. The film tells the story of a married couple who reflect on their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip from England to the French Riviera. As they survey their foundering marriage in the present, the evolution of their relationship reveals itself through vignettes from four previous trips they took along the same route. The film was made from an original screenplay by Frederic Raphael. Supporting cast members include Eleanor Bron, William Daniels, Claude Dauphin, and Nadia Gray. &quot;Two for the Road&quot; was Hepburn&#x27;s penultimate film before her semi-retirement in early 1967.

Raphael conceived the idea for the film while driving with his wife to the south of France. He suggested the project initially to producer Joseph Janni, who declined it, and then wrote the script for Donen. Originally the film was to be made by Universal, but after the studio backed out, Donen took the project to Twentieth Century-Fox. &quot;Two for the Road&quot; is notable for combining the styles of a traditional Hollywood romance with elements of the French New Wave. Cars figure prominently in the film and, when the narrative jumps in time, help to establish the current year. &quot;Two for the Road&quot; was a rare Hepburn picture where she did not wear a wardrobe designed by Hubert de Givenchy, as Donen wanted her to have a more conventional appearance. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Henry Mancini, who called the theme song his favourite piece of music he wrote. Principal photography began on 3 May 1966 and concluded on 1 September. The film was released on 27 April 1967 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

Upon its release the film received mostly positive reviews but failed to make a profit. Its mixed response was in large part due to its experimental, non-linear structure, and coalescence of commercial and artistic filmmaking. Additionally, Hepburn&#x27;s role as a wife and mother in a collapsing marriage was a radical departure from the ingénues she typically had played hitherto. In subsequent years, the film&#x27;s reputation has grown substantially, with numerous authors citing it as Donen&#x27;s greatest film, and Hepburn&#x27;s performance as the best of her career.

== Plot ==
In 1966, architect Mark Wallace and his wife Joanna take a flight from England to France. There, they begin a drive to Saint-Tropez to meet with Mark&#x27;s longtime client, Maurice Dalbret. Meanwhile, they reflect on previous trips they made along the same route.

The first trip takes place in 1954 when Mark and Joanna see each other on a ferry parting from England. Mark is on a photography trip, while Joanna is travelling with her choir to a festival in Menton. When the ferry arrives in Dieppe, Mark becomes alarmed thinking he lost his passport, but Joanna finds it in his backpack. On the road to Abbeville, the choir&#x27;s van runs off the road and Mark stops to help them. Mark travels with the girls to Abbeville, and after everyone but Joanna and he catches chickenpox, the two go on alone together southwards. Mark tries to ditch Joanna, but she stays with him. She tells Mark she loves him, and they spend the night together. Eventually they arrive at the Mediterranean, stay in cheap hotels and spend their days at the beach. At the end of their week together, Mark asks Joanna to marry him.

The second trip is in 1957 when the Wallaces have been married two years. They travel with an American family. The family consists of Mark&#x27;s former girlfriend from the University of Chicago, Cathy Seligman, her husband Howard Maxwell-Manchester, and their young daughter Ruthie. After Ruthie says that Cathy called Joanna a &quot;suburban English nobody,&quot; Mark and Joanna leave the Maxwell-Manchesters and continue travelling by themselves.

The third trip takes place in 1959, when the Wallaces travel for the first time on their own as a married couple, driving a rundown car. Along the way, Joanna announces that she is pregnant. After the car catches fire, the Wallaces pull into a luxury hotel, the Domaine Saint-Just. They stay the night there and in the morning push the burnt-out car away. On the road, they are picked up in a by Maurice and Françoise Dalbret, a wealthy couple who were also staying at the Domaine. The Wallaces travel south with the Dalbrets and stay at the latter&#x27;s villa in Ramatuelle, where Maurice introduces Mark to his Greek partner, Nikos Palamos. At the end of the trip Maurice hires Mark to work for him.

After the birth of Caroline, the Wallaces&#x27; daughter, Mark travels alone to France. During the trip, he spends a night with someone named Simone. During this time, he writes to Joanna lying about his activities and claiming to &quot;miss&quot; her.

In 1963, Mark and Joanna travel with Caroline, to see the project Mark is working on for Dalbret and Palamos. At the Dalbret property, Joanna meets Françoise&#x27;s brother, David, and begins an affair with him. After she and David spend the night together Mark confronts them, and Joanna confesses she is in love with David. David later gives her the choice to leave Mark and come with him, however, she elects to return to Mark.

On the present, the Wallaces discuss the possibility of a divorce. When they stop for the night in a hotel, Mark is engrossed in work and pays little attention to Joanna. They arrive at the house Mark designed for the Comte and Comtesse de Florac on the fictional Cap Valéry. There is a party there. During it, Mark receives a call from potential client Hal Van Benius, who says that he has hired him for a job that will require Mark to be in the United States for two years. Mark and Joanna sneak out of the party. While driving through the forest, they admit to one another that despite their frequent unhappiness and past unfaithfulness, they love one another and could never be apart.

The couple later travels to meet Van Benius in Rome. At the France–Italy border, Mark believes he has lost his passport, but Joanna holds it and leaves it for him on the steering wheel while he searches the trunk. They call each other &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;bastard&quot; and drive into Italy.

==Production==

=== Writing and casting ===
Raphael conceived the idea for &quot;Two for the Road&quot; in 1963 while driving with his wife from London to Rome. This was a trip the couple had taken many times through their relationship, having first done it hitchhiking and now driving in an expensive car. He described himself thinking during the drive, &quot;imagine if we overtook ourselves on the road ten years ago. Ten years seemed a long time in those days. Then I said, &#x27;wait a minute. That&#x27;s a movie.&#x27; &quot; Raphael floated the idea to producer Joseph Janni, with whom he was working at the time on the picture &quot;Darling&quot;, directed by John Schlesinger. Janni thought it was a good idea, but did not pursue it.

After &quot;Darling&quot;, Raphael was asked by Norman Panama to write the script for &quot;Not with My Wife, You Don&#x27;t!&quot; Raphael told his agent it was a &quot;vulgar, banal story&quot; and that he could not do it, but his agent persuaded him to take the project, which would pay £9,000. Not long after he began writing, Raphael decided he had to quit the film, even though reneging on the contract might cost him his reputation in the film industry. Raphael met in London with Panama, who agreed to let him go. During the meeting, Panama mentioned that at a recent dinner party Stanley Donen had expressed his praise for the writing in &quot;Nothing but the Best&quot;. At the party, Donen had said to Panama about Raphael, &quot;you lucky SOB. Why haven&#x27;t I got him?&quot; Panama offered to ask Donen to phone Raphael.

After talking on the telephone, Donen and Raphael met in London in 1964. Raphael has given differing accounts of when he suggested the &quot;Two for the Road&quot; idea to Donen. In one instance he claimed to have mentioned it at their first meeting, and in another he said that he and Donen went back and forth for a time before he brought it up. In either case, Donen was intrigued by the concept and gave Raphael $40,000 to write the script. After the project was underway, Donen telephoned Audrey Hepburn to see if she was interested in it. Having just finished the unsuccessful &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot;, which used some of the same non-linear storytelling Raphael intended for &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, she did not want to participate. Nonetheless, Raphael and Donen decided to proceed with the script.

The story was not autobiographical, but was inspired by Raphael&#x27;s own marriage. He said that the events in the story were &quot;based mainly on the experiences of my wife and me, but with a certain degree of expansiveness. These are not necessarily things that happened, but what might have happened.&quot; Raphael wrote the first draft of the script in the fall of 1964 while staying with his family in an apartment on the Via Francesco Ferrara in Rome. To compose the work, he wrote individual scenes on cards then rearranged them on the floor, creating a mosaic effect. Raphael sent the typed script to Donen in England on Wednesday, 11 November. After reading the script, Donen telephoned on Friday, 13 November to say he thought it was the best script he had ever read. Despite her previous rejection, Donen then sent the scrip to Hepburn, who agreed to meet in Switzerland to discuss it. In January 1965, Donen and Raphael flew to Switzerland to meet Hepburn at her home in Bürgenstock and try a second time to convince her to work on the film. When they met, Hepburn told the men, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to say too much about how much I like the script of &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, in case it embarrasses Frederico.&quot; However, Hepburn was concerned over the effect it would have on her &quot;pudique&quot; image to play a part that included nudity, premarital sex, and adultery. Donen and Raphael allayed her fears and convinced her to accept the role. Hepburn signed for $750,000, her standard rate at the time.

Donen took the picture initially to Universal, who had distributed his previous two films. His first choice for the leading man was Paul Newman, whom he sent the script. Newman declined the part on the grounds that it was a &quot;director&#x27;s picture&quot; unsuited to a major star. After Newman&#x27;s rejection, Universal dropped the project. Given he had signed a contract with Hepburn already, Donen could not abandon the project and was forced to find another studio. He managed to secure backing from Richard D. Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox. Zanuck gave the film $5 million to work with, and explained to Donen that the studio&#x27;s 1966 Oscar budget would be dedicated to &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;. Donen&#x27;s second choice for the lead male part was Albert Finney, who signed in early September 1965 for $300,000. At the time, Finney&#x27;s only major credit was &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, and he was largely unknown in the United States. Donen said later he was quite nervous about giving the part to Finney. In December 1965 Hepburn became pregnant, which would set the filming back at least a year. However, in January 1966 she miscarried, which allowed the movie to go ahead.

Finney and Hepburn had never met, so Donen arranged a luncheon in Paris for them. At the meeting, Finney brought with him a male friend, and for the first part of the meal pretended to be an effeminate homosexual. Donen said that &quot;the entire lunch, Audrey&#x27;s jaw kept dropping.&quot; Unable to contain himself anymore, Finney burst out laughing and quit the performance. The gag served to break the ice between the two leads.

After seeing the film &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, Donen decided on the spot to offer the parts of the American couple to William Daniels and Barbara Harris. At the time, Daniels and Harris were both in the stage musical &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;. Daniels accepted the part, but Harris turned it down to continue appearing in the musical. The part of the wife went instead to English actress Eleanor Bron. Before Daniels flew to France for filming, Donen instructed him to purchase two madras jackets for his character to wear. The ostentatious jackets, a staple of Ivy League fashion, would accentuate the &quot;ugly American&quot; traits of Daniels&#x27;s character. The part of Mark and Joanna&#x27;s daughter Caroline went to child actress Kathy Chelimsky. Four years earlier, Kathy&#x27;s older brother, Thomas Chelimsky, had played the part of Jean-Louis Gaudel in Donen and Hepburn&#x27;s previous collaboration, &quot;Charade&quot;.

=== Filming ===

The filming of &quot;Two for the Road&quot; began on 3 May 1966, the day before Hepburn&#x27;s 37th birthday. At the time, Hepburn&#x27;s marriage to Mel Ferrer was breaking down. During the production she went to France alone while Ferrer elected to remain in Tolochenaz with their son, Sean Ferrer, and negotiate the production of &quot;Wait until Dark&quot;. Donen noted of Hepburn that &quot;she was very strung up as we began filming. It was Albert who helped put her at ease.&quot; Finney, who came from a Northern working-class background, was in many ways the antithesis of the aristocratic Hepburn and was able to draw out a previously unseen side of her personality. As filming went on, the two became increasingly close and spent much of their time together outside of work, going out to eat and dance in the evenings. Finney later reflected on their relationship, explaining, &quot;doing a scene with her, my mind knew I was acting but my heart didn&#x27;t, and my body certainly didn&#x27;t! Playing a love scene with someone as sexy as Audrey, you sometimes get to that edge where make-believe and reality are blurred. [...] The time spent with Audrey is one of the closest I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Finney regularly teased Hepburn, calling her &quot;tawdry Audrey&quot; and &quot;Audrey Sunburn.&quot; Author Irwin Shaw, who visited the set, said of Hepburn, &quot;she and Albie had this wonderful thing together, like a pair of kids with a perfect shorthand of jokes and references that closed out everybody else. It was like a brother and sister in their teens. When Mel was there, Audrey and Albie got rather formal and a little awkward, as if now they had to behave like grown ups.&quot;

The nature of Finney and Hepburn&#x27;s relationship or how it ended was never disclosed. An unnamed source related, &quot;if [Albert] and Audrey did make love, then they were discreet about it. But no one doubted the warmth between them.&quot; Charles Higham wrote that &quot;William Daniels [...] says that he wouldn&#x27;t deny (though he didn&#x27;t actually know) that Audrey and Albert were lovers.&quot; According to biographer Donald Spoto, when filming finished in early September 1966, Ferrer threatened his wife with divorce if she did not end the relationship. As the divorce would have been filed on the grounds of her infidelity, Hepburn would risk losing custody of her son. Spoto said that, at this time, &quot;everyone around her noted a fearful expression and nervous anxiety that even Finney was unable to alleviate.&quot; Sean Ferrer explained later, &quot;I remember there was a tension in my parents&#x27; marriage at that time. Only years later did I realize it was because she was having an affair with Finney during the making of that movie.&quot; Hepburn remained silent about the relationship, though Finney hinted at it to friends. Robert Sallin claimed that Finney told him about the affair and said Hepburn was &quot;rather like a blooming flower and then when her husband arrived, the flower closed up and shriveled.&quot; Hepburn&#x27;s partner later in life, Robert Wolders, said that &quot;Audrey cared for Finney a great deal. It was the beginning of a new period of her life.&quot;

Hepburn and Finney&#x27;s closeness during the making of the film translated in their performances. Donen said later, &quot;the Audrey I saw during the making of this film I didn&#x27;t even know. She overwhelmed me. She was so free, so happy. I never saw her like that. So young! I guess it was Albie.&quot; Hepburn, who was in her late 30s and insecure over her &quot;dreadful thinness,&quot; was uncomfortable doing some of the beach scenes in which she was to wear a bathing suit. Finney, however, convinced her, saying &quot;you&#x27;re really an eyeful, Audrey.&quot; Donen also struggled to convince Hepburn to do the scene at the Dalbret villa where she is thrown in the pool. As a nine-year-old, Hepburn had tangled her feet in weeds in a pond and nearly drowned, and remained terrified of water her whole life. After three days of coaxing her and denying her request for a body double, Donen got her to do the scene, albeit with two assistants waiting to pull her out after the shot.

The Dalbret scenes were filmed at a villa in L&#x27;Oumède, Ramatuelle. In the summer of 1968, the same villa was used as the principal location in the film &quot;La Piscine&quot; starring Alain Delon and Romy Schneider. The scene in which Schneider stands over Delon on the pool deck may have been borrowed from the scene in &quot;Two for the Road&quot; where Finney stands over Hepburn.

In the dialogue Joanna says that Mark was born in 1933, however, beyond that Raphael did not provide any background information about his characters. Donen invented several biographical details that are revealed on the passport the Wallaces use on their 1959 trip. The passport shows that Mark was born on 22 August 1933 in Chester, while Joanna was born on 11 July 1936 in Brentford. Joanna&#x27;s occupation is listed as &quot;housewife,&quot; which contradicts the script, when she later says &quot;by the time I get home from work, it&#x27;s pitch black.&quot; At the time, their residence is listed as Surrey. The detail of Mark&#x27;s forgetfulness was inspired directly by Raphael&#x27;s own.

Much of the dialogue had to be re-recorded due to the sound of outdoor generators on set. However, by the time of post-production, Jacqueline Bisset had left for the United States to make &quot;The Detective&quot;. Donen hired another actress to read Bisset&#x27;s parts and tried to get as close a match as he could. Consequently, Bisset&#x27;s voice in the film is not her own.

== Soundtrack ==

During the filming of &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, Donen and Hepburn agreed that Henry Mancini should write the score for the film. Mancini had scored the previous collaboration between Donen and Hepburn, 1963&#x27;s &quot;Charade&quot;. Hepburn cabled Mancini and wrote, &quot;Dearest Hank, please won&#x27;t you do the music? Couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone else but you scoring.&quot; Mancini noted that this was the only time in his career an actor, rather than a director, had asked him to write for a film. After he read the script, Mancini said to Donen, &quot;I can&#x27;t make head or tail of this,&quot; to which Donen responded, &quot;when you see it on the screen it will be much more obvious–the change of clothes, the change of cars.&quot; At the time, Mancini was depressed over his father&#x27;s death. The theme song he wrote for Donen was described as a &quot;rather sad, rather hurt-sounding melody, trying to be redolent of the film characters&#x27; regrets but rather indulging his own.&quot; Donen rejected the song after hearing it and communicated that he wanted a road song, not a love song.

Having seldom faced rejection for his work, Mancini wrote a new song that had &quot;more notes&quot; and an &quot;underlying pull and tension to it.&quot; The new theme Mancini wrote satisfied all Donen&#x27;s requirements and became Mancini&#x27;s personal favourite of the songs he had written. To evoke the French setting of the film, Mancini arranged solo accordion and violin parts in the title theme. The violin solo was played by the iconic French jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli, who Mancini calls &quot;Mr Grappelli&quot; in the score. The final score included 37 cues, compared to the 32 of &quot;Charade&quot;. Mancini recorded the soundtrack in London.

After the film was completed, Leslie Bricusse wrote lyrics to the theme song. Mancini then re-recorded parts of the score at RCA Studios in Hollywood, &quot;sans&quot; Grappelli, to use on the &quot;music from&quot; soundtrack album that was released on RCA Records. Mancini regretted making the second recordings, saying, &quot;I probably shouldn&#x27;t have done it, but I was trapped in a monster of my own making.&quot; The vocal version of the theme appears on the soundtrack but does not in the film. In subsequent years, artists including Andy Williams, Peggy Lee, Pat Metheny, Dave Grusin, and Seth MacFarlane have recorded the theme.

== Release ==
&quot;Two for the Road&quot; opened at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 27 April 1967 and ran until 24 May. Fox chose the theatre because of its past association with Donen films; &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, &quot;On the Town&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Charade&quot; had all premiered at Radio City. Donen fought the studio over the booking, as he believed &quot;Two for the Road&quot; was too intimate a picture for such a grand venue.

The film received its British premiere on 31 August 1967 at the Odeon Leicester Square. The same day, Hepburn and Ferrer announced the press that they were separating. The media speculated that this was a publicity stunt to coincide with the film&#x27;s release, though they learned later that the separation was genuine.

==Reception==

=== Initial reviews ===
In the &quot;New York World Journal Tribune&quot;, Judith Crist wrote, &quot;&quot;Two for the Road&quot; is that rare thing, an adult comedy by and for grown-ups, bright, brittle and sophisticated, underlined by cogency and honest emotion. And, far from coincidentally, it is a complex and beautifully made movie, eye-filling and engrossing with a &#x27;new&#x27; (mod and non-Givenchy) Audrey Hepburn displaying her too-long-neglected depths and scope as an actress.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;abandoning the Givenchy school and the elfin cool, Audrey Hepburn is surprisingly good as a Virginia Woolf-cub who has earned her share of scars in the jungle war between the sexes. As her mate, Albert Finney is not so fortunate, and seems curiously unsympathetic in helping to turn his marriage into a fray-for-all.&quot; The &quot;Independent Film Journal&quot; said, &quot;Miss Hepburn moves swiftly but gently through all the manifestations of virginity to marriage and womanhood, hardly missing any of the in-between stages. She is delicate and responsive in her performance, alternately seductive and aggressive, playing the theme of the joys and agonies of love to her womanly hilt.&quot; Meanwhile, Rex Reed wrote that &quot;&quot;Two for the Road&quot; is perhaps the best American movie of 1967,&quot; and that audiences would be rewarded by &quot;two of the most brilliant performances–by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney–ever captured on the screen.&quot;

The &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was slightly more critical, saying, &quot;despite its high-toned trimmings, a film like this must stand or fall by its stars, and the leading players are here well worth watching, even if they are never quite able to get beneath the skins of the characters they portray.&quot; Hollis Alpert in &quot;Saturday Review&quot; criticised the casting, saying &quot;Miss Hepburn is handicapped during her more immature periods by the fact that she is now a distinctly aging ingenue,&quot; and &quot;Finney seems too young to play a mature architect.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described the movie as &quot;a breezy trip through married life with Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s superb performance carrying stodgy Albert Finney most of the way.&quot; Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars and wrote, &quot;this is a slick, entirely professional, very smooth movie – but it is just because Donen and his associates are seasoned craftsmen that they never stoop to the obvious. They make &quot;Two for the Road&quot; two things: a Hollywood-style romance between beautiful people, and an honest story about recognizable human beings. I&#x27;d call it &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; for grown-ups.&quot;

In &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, Stephen Farber wrote that &quot;one of the most appealing things about the film is that it blurs the line between art and entertainment that many people wish were easier to draw. No one is going to call &quot;Two for the Road&quot; a great work of cinema art–it&#x27;s just too pretty, too charming, at times too sentimental. But if you dismiss the movie as &#x27;mere entertainment,&#x27; you dismiss one of the few features made anywhere in the last couple of years that provides a different kind of film experience, and that makes demands on its audience.&quot; Farber also praised the film&#x27;s treatment of time, saying it &quot;is the first film I know that convincingly communicates the feeling of time passing, years actually lived in. [...] &quot;Two for the Road&quot;&#x27;s kaleidoscope of liquid time and emotion blows our minds, gives us the sensation of life actually, painfully changing as we watch it.&quot;

The most critical review came the day after the premiere from Bosley Crowther in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Crowther wrote, &quot;there are some precious moments of romantic charm in this bitter account of domestic discord amid surroundings that should inspire nothing but delight. And so one must seize upon them for the entertainment that is to be had, and endure the tedium of much of the picture.&quot; It is possible Crowther&#x27;s review was prejudiced, as he and Donen had clashed at a pre-screening press conference several days earlier. After Crowther called the film &quot;commercial American trash,&quot; Donen dressed him down publicly by saying &quot;as far as I&#x27;m concerned, you are nothing but an impossible son of a bitch.&quot;

=== Retrospective reviews ===
In an interview in 1973, Donen criticised some of the choices he made in the film. He related, &quot;in a strange way I don&#x27;t think &quot;Two for the Road&quot; succeeds in itself because I chickened out. It should be a much more serious film than it is, because it really is a film that examines the basis of the marital relationship–unlike &quot;Indiscreet&quot;, which is a bubble of a romantic movie. &quot;Two for the Road&quot; attempts to truly examine marriage, but I made it too entertaining and didn&#x27;t really probe as deeply as one could have within the context of what we were working with. I blame myself and only myself, really. But yes, I think it&#x27;s a good movie; I&#x27;m not trying to rap &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, but if I could have done it again I could have done better with it.&quot;

Stephen M. Silverman wrote of the film, &quot;however one approaches &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, it stands the test of time as Stanley Donen&#x27;s best work. It is the picture that film students most request to speak to him about. It is his most personal film and his most passionate. It moves to his rhythm. It reflects his originality. And it is a film that has a lyricism all its own.&quot; In retrospect, Donen criticised Finney for the lack of affection Mark Wallace displays for his wife. Donen said, &quot;it came out a little one-sided, like he&#x27;s a shit, and he wasn&#x27;t supposed to be.&quot; On the other hand, Donen thought Hepburn&#x27;s performance was the best of her career. He explained, &quot;the role required a depth of emotion, care, yearning, and maturity that Audrey had never played before. She gave what I think is her best performance.&quot; Raphael commented later, &quot;I am somewhat biased, but I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen a performance more manifestly worthy of an Oscar, if that matters, than Audrey&#x27;s in &quot;Two for the Road&quot;.&quot;

One of Hepburn&#x27;s biographers, Charles Higham, wrote that &quot;the picture was to achieve an extraordinary level of emotional intensity, all the more remarkable because it was hidden in humour. Audrey&#x27;s portrayal of a range of emotions as the seemingly lighthearted Joanna Wallace betokened a striking advance for her as an actress, and this was perhaps her finest performance on the screen. In one sequence in the south of France, as she ran tearfully through a garden to a swimming pool followed by Albert Finney&#x27;s Mark Wallace, she was astonishingly open in her expression of personal pain.&quot;

Drew Casper said, &quot;Raphael&#x27;s dialogue is gorgeously crafted: sharply in character, witty, fecund with Pinteresque pauses and silences that mean as much as the words and are, above all, so touching.&quot; He summarised the film saying, &quot;today, &quot;Two for the Road&quot; is regarded as one of the best romantic comedy-dramas to come out of Hollywood and enjoys a cult status, viewed again and again by film aestheticians, students, and enthusiasts.&quot;

===Box office===
According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $8,950,000 to break even, and made $7,200,000.

== Artefacts ==
The &quot;disc dress&quot; designed by Paco Rabanne that Hepburn wears in the house party scene is owned by the Riverside Museum in Glasgow. The paste tiara she wore in the scene where Joanna and Mark return to the Dalbret house after the gala sold in 2017 at Christie&#x27;s for GBP 43,750.

The right-hand drive 1965 Mercedes-Benz 230 SL used in the film was Donen&#x27;s personal car. In the film the car wears the same registration, MML 303C, as the red 230 used in &quot;Arabesque&quot;. It is unclear if it was the same car and was repainted white, or if it was a different car he purchased after &quot;Arabesque&quot; was filmed. The car&#x27;s current whereabouts are unknown.

<text>Fujian Normal University () is a public university in Fuzhou, China. FNU has been hailed as the Fujian province&#x27;s &quot;Cradle of teachers.&quot;

==History==
Tracing its origin back to Fujian Superior Normal School, founded in 1907, Fujian Normal University (FNU) is Fujian&#x27;s oldest university and one of China&#x27;s most time-honored teachers’ colleges. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the school (which had been renamed Fujian Provincial Normal College) merged in 1953 with Fukian Christian University and Hua Nan Women&#x27;s College to form a new and significantly expanded Fujian Normal College. The Fukian Christian University was founded by the Church Missionary Society in the Fukian Mission where Constance Bryant was the administrator. FNU acquired its current name in 1972.

==Overview==
In Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, FNU has two campuses — Qishan and Cangshan — with a land area of about 230 hectares.

The university consists of 28 colleges, which together offer 56 undergraduate programs, over 120 master programs (including those conferring professional degrees in pedagogy, public administration, physical culture and arts), about 50 doctoral programs and 7 post-doctoral research centers. These programs cover subject areas in literature, history, philosophy, physics, engineering, pedagogy, economics, law, business management, agriculture, etc.

==Training programs==
In addition to regular academic programs, FNU has been authorized by the state to provide on-the-job training for teachers of elementary, secondary, occupational schools as well as colleges. It has been singled out for setting up experimental pilot programs in distance education and in teaching Chinese as a foreign language. It has been authorized to admit students from Taiwan on an experimental basis.

Teaching, however, is just one aspect of the dual task which FNU has taken on. To turn the university into a school oriented to both teaching and research, its faculty has been paying just as much attention to scientific investigations and scholarly pursuits. The efforts have started to pay off. The university is at present the proud host to as many as four national centers for scientific research and personnel training, eight key laboratories or research centers sponsored by the ministries concerned or the provincial government, one Ministry of Education sponsored research center for basic education, and several dozen of provincially sponsored laboratories and research institutes.

==Students==
Over 20,000 students are enrolled in the two campuses in Fuzhou, among whom over 4,600 are pursuing their graduate degrees. Some others are international students from 17 countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and from China&#x27;s Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan areas or from overseas Chinese families around the world.

===International student life===
Most of the international students come from neighbouring Asian countries, including Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea.

The International Students College is near many shopping areas including Student Street (), Baolong Mall (), Taijiang (), and Dongbai Yuan Hong ().

==Faculty==
It has a 2,600-strong teaching and auxiliary staff.

Its faculty counts more than 700 full and associate professors, among whom two have been elected members of the Eurasian Academy of Sciences, seven have received the honorific title of &quot;Young and Middle-aged Experts with Distinguished Services,&quot; two are members of the subject-specific advisory groups under the State Council Commission for Regulating Academic Degrees, six are &quot;Professors Extraordinaire&quot; or &quot;Minjiang Scholars&quot;, one has been honored as &quot;China’s Distinguished Teacher&quot;, six as &quot;Fujian’s Distinguished Teachers,&quot; and 22 as &quot;Fujian’s Distinguished Experts&quot;, to mention a fraction of the honors and recognitions won by FNU scholars.

==Facilities==
The university is noted for its fine facilities for teaching and research.

Its library holds a collection of as many as 2.86 million books. It is one of the largest libraries in normal universities throughout China. The library is famed internationally for its very impressive collections of ancient texts, rare books, rubbings of engraved tablets, photographs, calligraphic works and paintings, Fujian&#x27;s local cultural and historical documents, early editions of foreign language publications, and major newspapers published during the historic period known as the May Fourth Movement.

The university is equipped with over 7,000 computers for teaching and research, over 100 multimedia classrooms, and more than 30 language laboratories. Among its facilities for conducting pedagogical and scientific experiments are a university computation center, an analyzing and testing center, a center of modern educational technologies, in addition to the 70-odd research institutes and centers run by its colleges. A high-speed intranet serves the campuses, and it is expanding rapidly to cater to the ever-increasing needs of the university community.

==International education==
Founded in 1988, the International College of Chinese Studies of the Fujian Normal University (formerly International Cultural and Educational Exchange Center, FNU) was authorized by the State Education Commission as one of the four Chinese teaching bases to admit students from Southeast Asia. In 1997, it received its current name.

The International College of Chinese Studies undertakes the work of recruiting, teaching and advising foreign students for degree and non-degree courses. The school has a well-equipped administrative system, qualified teachers, and modest teaching and learning means. However, complaints have been filed by students with regard to the living conditions. Buildings and dormitories often do not meet appropriate safety standards.

<text>Nevil Vincent Sidgwick FRS (8 May 1873 – 15 March 1952) was an English theoretical chemist who made significant contributions to the theory of valency and chemical bonding.

==Biography==

Sidgwick was born in Park Town, Oxford, the elder of two children of William Carr Sidgwick, lecturer at Oriel College, and Sarah Isabella (née Thompson), descended from a notable family; her uncle was Thomas Perronet Thompson.

He was initially educated at Summer Fields School but, after a year, he entered Rugby School in 1886. From there he was elected to an open scholarship in Natural Science at Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a first in 1895, and went on to gain another first in Greats in 1897, a very rare feat. His principal interest, though, was science, and he spent some time in Wilhelm Ostwald’s laboratory in Germany, where he fell ill and had to go home. He returned to Germany in the autumn of 1899, this time in Hans von Pechmann’s lab at the University of Tübingen. His researches on derivatives of acetone-dicarboxylic acid resulted in his being award a DSc in 1901.

Sidgwick was elected to a Fellowship at Lincoln College, where he went into residence in October 1901 and remained for the rest of his life.

In 1914 Sidgwick was one of the members of the party chosen to represent the British Association for the meeting held in Australia. On 1 July he set sail on the maiden voyage of the &quot;Euripides&quot; from London to Brisbane, disembarking at Adelaide. A fellow first-class passenger was Sir Ernest Rutherford, who had been knighted that year. Sidgwick became a devotee of the physicist, and would hear no criticism of him in later years. On the return journey, via Penang, in November 1914, a fellow passenger on the &quot;Kashima Maru&quot; was the astronomer and physicist Professor A S Eddington.

Sidgwick became absorbed by the study of atomic structure and its importance in chemical bonding. He explained the bonding in coordination compounds (complexes), with a convincing account of the significance of the dative bond. Together with his students he demonstrated the existence and wide-ranging importance of the hydrogen bond. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1922.

In 1927, he proposed the inert pair effect which describes the stability of heavier p-block atoms in an oxidation state two less than the maximum. In 1940 his Bakerian lecture with Herbert Marcus Powell correlated molecular geometry with the number of valence electrons on a central atom. These ideas were later developed into the VSEPR theory by Gillespie and Nyholm.

The scope and significance of his researches brought international fame for Sidgwick. He travelled to Toronto for a British Association meeting in 1924, and then explored much of western Canada. Another BA meeting in 1929 took him to Cape Town and then Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, and back home via Aden and Suez. Two years later he was off to spend a semester at Cornell University, via New York and Princeton University. Cornell provided him “with every luxury that an American laboratory can supply. Two offices, four telephones, a private laboratory, and a stenographer, all to myself. . . It is a wonderful place, with a great deal of good work going on, and everybody is most kind, so that I can see that I am going to have a very pleasant time here.” His stay at Ithaca was followed by a 10,000 mile trip to the West and back via Yellowstone National Park, Buffalo, Ottawa and Quebec.

Back in Oxford, he concentrated as much as he could on new books, and revisions to earlier ones, but was diverted by his serving on several committees. He had several more trips to the United States in the 1930s and later, culminating in a voyage on the &quot;Britannic&quot; from Liverpool to New York on 27 July 1951. He was given a warm reception at the American Chemical Society meeting in New York in early September, having earlier had the chance to visit Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Nevil Vincent Sidgwick died, unmarried, at the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 15 March 1952, leaving effects worth £67,000.

<doc id="919056" wikidata="Q81890" url="?curid=919056" title="Bismuth subsalicylate">
<text>Bismuth subsalicylate, sold generically as pink bismuth and under brand names including Pepto-Bismol, Pepti-Calm and BisBacter, is a medication used to treat temporary discomfort of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. This includes an upset stomach, heartburn or other similar symptoms.

Bismuth subsalicylate has the empirical chemical formula C7H5BiO4, and is a colloidal substance obtained by hydrolysis of bismuth salicylate (Bi(C6H4(OH)CO2)3).

==Medical uses==
As a derivative of salicylic acid, bismuth subsalicylate displays anti-inflammatory and bactericidal action. It also acts as an antacid.

==Mechanism of action==
Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antacid and antidiarrheal, and to treat some other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea. The means by which this occurs is still not well documented. It is thought to be some combination of the following:
*Stimulation of absorption of fluids and electrolytes by the intestinal wall (antisecretory action)
*As a salicylate, reducing inflammation/irritation of stomach and intestinal lining through inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthase 1/2
*Reduction in hypermotility of the stomach
*Inhibits adhesion and filmogenesis by &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; 
*Bactericidal action of a number of its subcomponents, including salicylic acid
*Bactericidal action via a so-called oligodynamic effect in which small amounts of heavy metals such as bismuth damage many different bacteria species.
*Weak antacid properties

&quot;In vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; data have shown that bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the gut to bismuth oxychloride and salicylic acid and less commonly bismuth hydroxide. In the stomach, this is likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The salicylic acid is absorbed and therapeutical concentrations of salicylic acid can be found in blood after bismuth subsalicylate administration. Bismuth oxychloride and bismuth hydroxide are both believed to have bactericidal effects, as is salicylic acid for enterotoxigenic &quot;E. coli&quot;, a common cause of &quot;traveler&#x27;s diarrhea&quot;.

Organobismuth compounds have historically been used in growth media for selective isolation of microorganisms. Such salts have been shown to inhibit proliferation of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, other enteric bacteria, and some fungi.

==Adverse effects==
There are some adverse effects. It can cause a black tongue and black stools in some users of the drug when it combines with trace amounts of sulfur in saliva and the colon to form bismuth sulfide. Bismuth sulfide is a highly insoluble black salt, and the discoloration seen is temporary and harmless.

Long-term use (more than six weeks) may lead to accumulation and toxicity. High daily intake over a period of months can possibly cause severe fatigue, weakness and neurological symptoms that reverse with discontinuation. Some of the risks of salicylism can apply to the use of bismuth subsalicylate.

Children should not take medication with bismuth subsalicylate while recovering from influenza or chicken pox, as epidemiologic evidence points to an association between the use of salicylate-containing medications during certain viral infections and the onset of Reye syndrome. For the same reason, it is typically recommended that nursing mothers not use medication containing bismuth subsalicylate because small amounts of the medication are excreted in human breast milk, and these pose a theoretical risk of Reye syndrome to nursing children.

Salicylates are very toxic to cats, and thus bismuth subsalicylate should not be administered to cats.

The British National Formulary does not recommend bismuth-containing antacids (unless chelated), cautioning that absorbed bismuth can be neurotoxic, causing encephalopathy, and that such antacids tend to be constipating.

== Drug interactions ==
There is an increased risk of bleeding when using bismuth subsalicylate and anticoagulation therapy, like Coumadin (Warfarin).

==History==
Bismuth salts were in use in Europe by the late 1700s. The combination of bismuth subsalicylate and zinc salts for astringency with salol (phenyl salicylate) appears to have begun in the US in the early 20th century as a remedy for life-threatening diarrhea in infants with cholera. At first sold directly to physicians, it was first marketed as &quot;Bismosal&quot; in 1918.

Pepto-Bismol was first sold in 1900 by a doctor in New York. It was originally sold as a remedy for infant diarrhea by Norwich Pharmacal Company under the name &quot;Bismosal: Mixture Cholera Infantum&quot;. It was renamed Pepto-Bismol in 1919. Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Procter and Gamble in 1982.

As of 1946 and 1959, Canadian advertisements placed by Norwich show the product as Pepto-Besmal both in graphic and text.

Pepto-Bismol is an over-the-counter drug currently produced by the Procter &amp; Gamble company in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Pepto-Bismol is made in chewable tablets and swallowable caplets, but it is best known for its original formula, which is a thick liquid. This original formula is a medium pink in color, with a teaberry (methyl salicylate) flavor.

Generic bismuth subsalicylate and other branded versions of the drug are widely available in pill and liquid form.

==Structure==
Despite its common usage and commercial significance, the exact structure of the pharmaceutical long remained undetermined, but was revealed, through the use of advanced electron crystallography techniques, to be a layered coordination polymer with the formula BiO(C7H5O3). In the structure, both the carboxylate and phenol groups of the salicylate coordinate towards the bismuth cations. The determination of bismuth subsalicylate had long been hindered due to the small particle size as well as defects within the structure, arising from variations in the stacking arrangement of the bismuth subsalicylate layers, which could be observed as part of the structural investigation.

<doc id="919057" wikidata="Q971766" url="?curid=919057" title="Field-emission display">
<text>A field-emission display (FED) is a flat panel display technology that uses large-area field electron emission sources to provide electrons that strike colored phosphor to produce a color image. In a general sense, an FED consists of a matrix of cathode-ray tubes, each tube producing a single sub-pixel, grouped in threes to form red-green-blue (RGB) pixels. FEDs combine the advantages of CRTs, namely their high contrast levels and very fast response times, with the packaging advantages of LCD and other flat-panel technologies. They also offer the possibility of requiring less power, about half that of an LCD system. FEDs can also be made transparent.

Sony was the major proponent of the FED design and put considerable research and development effort into the system during the 2000s, planning mass production in 2009. Sony&#x27;s FED efforts started winding down in 2009, as LCD became the dominant flat-panel technology. In January 2010, AU Optronics announced that it acquired essential FED assets from Sony and intends to continue development of the technology. , no large-scale commercial FED production has been undertaken.

FEDs are closely related to another developing display technology, the surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED), differing primarily in details of the electron-emission system.

==Operation==
FED display operates like a conventional cathode-ray tube (CRT) with an electron gun that uses high voltage (10 kV) to accelerate electrons, which in turn excite the phosphors, but instead of a single electron gun, an FED display contains a grid of individual nanoscopic electron guns. It consists of 2 sheets of glass spaced at regular intervals that face each other, one of which contains the emitters, spacers and the grid, and the other that contains the phosphors.

An FED screen is constructed by laying down a series of metal stripes onto a glass plate to form a series of cathode lines. Photolithography is used to lay down a series of rows of switching gates at right angles to the cathode lines, forming an addressable grid. At the intersection of each row and column a small patch of up to 4,500 emitters is deposited, typically using methods developed from inkjet printers. The metal grid is laid on top of the switching gates to complete the gun structure.

A high voltage-gradient field is created between the emitters and a metal mesh suspended above them, pulling electrons from the tips of the emitters. This is a highly non-linear process, and small changes in voltage will quickly cause the number of emitted electrons to saturate. The grid can be individually addressed, but only the emitters located at the crossing points of the powered cathode, gate lines will have enough power to produce a visible spot, and any power leaks to surrounding elements will not be visible. The non-linearity of the process allows avoidance of active matrix addressing schemes – once the pixel lights up, it will naturally glow. Non-linearity also means that the brightness of the sub-pixel is pulse-width modulated to control the number of electrons being produced, like in plasma displays.

The grid voltage sends the electrons flowing into the open area between the emitters at the back and the screen at the front of the display, where a second accelerating voltage additionally accelerates them towards the screen, giving them enough energy to light the phosphors. Since the electrons from any single emitter are fired toward a single sub-pixel, the scanning electromagnets are not needed.

CNT-FEDs use carbon nanotubes doped with nitrogen and/or boron as emitters. Samsung has previously worked on the development of this kind of display, however, Samsung has never released any products using this technology. CNT-FED places the carbon nanotube emitters at the bottom center of cavities called gate holes, which are made using electrically insulating material. A gold film is deposited on top of this material without blocking the gate holes in order to allow electrons from the carbon nanotubes to pass through. The gold film acts as a gate or grid, which accelerates the electrons. Gold is also used as the cathode, and the carbon nanotubes are built on top of it. The cathode is laid out using photolithography to create an addressable grid. Spacers are placed at regular intervals which keep both glass panels 300 microns apart. The space created by the spaces contains a vacuum. The anode may be made out of aluminum or Indium tin oxide (ITO), and it may be placed below or on top of the phosphors.

==Disadvantages==
Just like any other displays with individually addressable sub-pixels, FED displays can potentially suffer from manufacturing problems that will result in dead pixels. However, the emitters are so small that many &quot;guns&quot; can power a sub-pixel, the screen can be examined for dead emitters and pixel brightness corrected by increasing the pulse width to make up for the loss through increased emissions from the other emitters feeding the same pixel.
# The efficiency of the field emitters is based on the extremely small radii of the tips, but this small size renders the cathodes susceptible to damage by ion impact. The ions are produced by the high voltages interacting with residual gas molecules inside the device.
# FED display requires a vacuum to operate, so the display tube has to be sealed and mechanically robust. However, since the distance between the emitters and phosphors is quite small, generally a few millimeters, the screen can be mechanically reinforced by placing spacer strips or posts between the front and back face of the tube.
# FEDs require high vacuum levels, which are difficult to attain: the vacuum suitable for conventional CRTs and vacuum tubes is not sufficient for long-term FED operation. Intense electron bombardment of the phosphor layer will also release gas during use.

==Competing technologies==

===Cathode-ray tube===
FEDs eliminate much of the electrical complexity of cathode-ray tubes, including the heated filaments in the electron gun used to generate electrons and the electromagnets in the deflection yokes used to steer the beam, and are thus much more power efficient than a CRT of similar size. However, FEDs are technically worse than CRTs, as they are not capable of multiscanning.

===LCD===
Flat-panel LCDs use a bright light source and filter out half of the light with a polarizer, and then filter most of the light to produce red, green and blue (RGB) sources for the sub-pixels. That means that, at best, only 1/6 (or less in practice) of the light being generated at the back of the panel reaches the screen. In most cases the liquid crystal matrix itself then filters out additional light in order to change the brightness of the sub-pixels and produce a color gamut. So in spite of using extremely efficient light sources like cold-cathode fluorescent lamps or high-power white LEDs, the overall efficiency of an LCD is not very high. Although the lighting process used in the FED is less efficient, only lit sub-pixels require power, which means that FEDs are more efficient than LCDs. Sony&#x27;s 36&quot; FED prototypes have been shown drawing only 14 W when displaying brightly lit scenes, whereas a conventional LCD screen of similar size would normally draw well over 100 W.

Avoiding the need for a backlighting system and thin-film transistor active matrix also greatly reduces the complexity of the set as a whole, while also reducing its front-to-back thickness. While an FED has two sheets of glass instead of the one in an LCD, the overall weight is likely to be less than of a similarly sized LCD. FEDs are also claimed to be cheaper to manufacture, as they have fewer total components and processes involved. However, they are not easy devices to manufacture as a reliable commercial device, and considerable production difficulties have been encountered. This led to a race with two other front-running technologies aiming to replace LCDs in television use, the active-matrix OLED and surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED).

===OLED===
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) cells directly emit light. Therefore, OLEDs require no separate light source and are highly efficient in terms of light output. They offer the same high contrast levels and fast response times that FED offers. OLEDs are a serious competitor to FEDs, but suffer from the same sorts of problems bringing them to mass production.

===SED===
SEDs are very similar to FEDs, the primary difference between the two technologies is that SED uses a single emitter for each column instead of the individual spots of the FED. Whereas an FED uses electrons emitted directly toward the front of the screen, the SED uses electrons that are emitted from the vicinity of a small &quot;gap&quot; in a surface-conducting track laid down parallel to the plane of the panel, and extracted sideways to their original direction of motion. SED uses an emitter array based on palladium oxide laid down by an inkjet or silk-screen process. SED has been considered to be the variant of FED that is feasible to mass-produce, however, as of late 2009 no commercial SED display products have been made available by the industry.

==History==
The first concentrated effort to develop FED systems started in 1991 by Silicon Video Corporation, later Candescent Technologies. Their &quot;ThinCRT&quot; displays used metal emitters, originally built out of tiny molybdenum cones known as Spindt tips. They suffered from erosion due to the high accelerating voltages. Attempts to lower accelerating voltages and find suitable phosphors that would work at lower power levels, as well as address the erosion problem through better materials, were unsuccessful.

Candescent pushed ahead with development in spite of problems, breaking ground on a new production facility in Silicon Valley in 1998, partnering with Sony. However the technology was not ready, and the company suspended equipment purchases in early 1999, citing &quot;contamination issues&quot;. The plant was never completed, and after spending $600 million on development they filed for Chapter 11 protection in June 2004, and sold all of their assets to Canon that August.

Another attempt to address the erosion issues was made by Advance Nanotech, a subsidiary of SI Diamond Technology of Austin, Texas. Advance Nanotech developed a doped diamond dust, whose sharp corners appeared to be an ideal emitter. However, the development never panned out, and was abandoned in 2003. Advance Nanotech then applied their efforts to the similar SED display, licensing their technology to Canon. When Canon brought in Toshiba to help developing the display, Advance Nanotech sued, but ultimately lost in their efforts to re-negotiate the contracts based on their claim that Canon transferred the technology to Toshiba.

Post-2000 FED research focused on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as emitters. Nano-emissive display (NED) was Motorola&#x27;s term for their carbon-nanotube-based FED technology. A prototype model was demonstrated in May 2005, but Motorola has now halted all FED-related development.

Futaba Corporation had been running a Spindt-type development program since 1990. They produced prototypes of smaller FED systems for a number of years and demonstrated them at various trade shows, but like the Candescent efforts, no large-screen production had been forthcoming. Later development continued on a nanotube based version.

Sony, having abandoned their efforts with Candescent, licensed CNT technology from Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., of Houston, Texas, who were the public licensing agent for a number of technologies developed at Rice University&#x27;s Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory. In 2007 they demonstrated an FED display at a trade show in Japan and claimed they would be introducing production models in 2009. They later spun off their FED efforts to Field Emission Technologies Inc., which continued to aim for a 2009 release.

Their plans to start production at a former Pioneer factory in Kagoshima were delayed by financial issues in late 2008. On March 26, 2009 Field Emission Technologies Inc. (FET) announced that it was closing down due to the inability to raise capital.

In January 2010, Taiwanese AU Optronics Corporation (AUO) announced that it had acquired assets from Sony&#x27;s FET and FET Japan, including &quot;patents, know-how, inventions, and relevant equipment related to FED technology and materials&quot;. In November 2010, Nikkei reported that AUO planned to start mass production of FED panels in the fourth quarter of 2011, however AUO commented that the technology was still in the research stage and there were no plans to begin mass production.

==Episode list==
===Season 1 (1986)===
===Season 2 (1987–88)===
==Home media==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of episodes of the series were released on VHS in the United States by Celebrity Home Entertainment&#x27;s Just for Kids label.

==Legal activity==
&quot;Foofur&quot; played a role in the case &quot;Nationwide Insurance v. Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois&quot;, 116 F.3d 1154 (7th Cir. 1997). The case dealt with an insurer&#x27;s duty to defend an insured party in light of the insured&#x27;s intentional acts of property damage. The insured, a drunken college student, spelled out &quot;FOO&quot;—meaning &quot;foo&quot;, a word derived from Foofur—on the artificial turf football field of Memorial Stadium with lighter fluid burning the letters into the turf. He caused $600,000 damage to the AstroTurf. The court held that such an act was not within the insurance policy&#x27;s liability coverage.

==Reception==
In 2014, listing it among twelve 1980s animated series that supposedly did not deserve remembrance, &quot;io9&quot; criticized the series, perceiving its premise to be contrived and remarking that &quot;someone had the gall to think this was &#x27;cool&#x27;&quot;.

<text>To Have and Have Not is a novel by Ernest Hemingway published in 1937 by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons. The book follows Harry Morgan, a fishing boat captain out of Key West, Florida. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; was Hemingway&#x27;s second novel set in the United States, after &quot;The Torrents of Spring&quot;.

Written sporadically between 1935 and 1937, and revised as he traveled back and forth from Spain during the Spanish Civil War, the novel portrays Key West and Cuba in the 1930s, and provides a social commentary on that time and place. Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers described the novel as heavily influenced by the Marxist ideology Hemingway was exposed to by his support of the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War while he was writing it. The work got a mixed critical reception.

The novel had its origins in two short stories published earlier in periodicals by Hemingway (&quot;One Trip Across&quot; and &quot;The Tradesman&#x27;s Return&quot;) which make up the opening chapters, and a novella, written later, which makes up about two-thirds of the book. The narrative is told from multiple viewpoints, at different times, by different characters, and the characters&#x27; names are frequently supplied under the chapter headings to indicate who is narrating that chapter.

==Summary==
Hemingway depicts Harry as an ordinary working man of the Depression Era, forced by dire economic forces into the black-market activity of running contraband between Cuba and Florida. A wealthy fishing charter customer (one of the &quot;Haves&quot;) bilks Harry by slipping away without paying after a three-week fishing trip, leaving Harry destitute. Stuck in Havana and motivated by the need to support his family, Harry then himself turns to crime. He makes a fateful decision to swindle would-be Chinese immigrants seeking passage into Florida from Cuba. Instead of transporting them as agreed, he murders the Chinese middle-man and puts the men ashore in Cuba. Harry begins to ferry different types of illegal cargo between the two countries, including alcohol and Cuban revolutionaries. These events alternate with chapters that describe the dissolute lives of wealthy yacht owners. The Great Depression features prominently in the novel, forcing depravity and hunger on the poor residents of Key West (the &quot;Have Nots&quot;) who are referred to locally as &quot;Conchs&quot;.

==Background and publication history==
&quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; began as a short story—published as &quot;One Trip Across&quot; in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in 1934—introducing the character of Harry Morgan. A second story was written and published in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1936, at which point Hemingway decided to write a novel about Harry Morgan. However, the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War delayed his work on it.

&quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; was published by Scribner&#x27;s on 15 October 1937 to a first edition print-run of approximately 10,000 copies. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; published a section of the novel as &quot;One Trip Across&quot; in 1934; &quot;Esquire&quot; published a section as &quot;The Tradesman&#x27;s Return&quot; in 1936. It was also published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII.

== Film adaptations ==

The novel was adapted into a 1944 film starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The film, directed by Howard Hawks, changed the story&#x27;s setting from Key West to Martinique under the Vichy regime, and made significant alterations to the plot, including removing themes involving economic inequality and class conflict, and turning the story into a romantic thriller centering on the sparks going on between Harry Morgan and Marie Browning.

The second film version, titled &quot;The Breaking Point&quot; (1950), was directed by Michael Curtiz and stars John Garfield and Patricia Neal with Juano Hernandez as Morgan&#x27;s partner. The movie shifted the action to southern California and made Garfield a former PT Boat captain but is otherwise the most faithful to the original book.

The third film version, titled &quot;The Gun Runners&quot; (1958), was directed by Don Siegel and stars Audie Murphy in the Bogart/Garfield role and Everett Sloane in Walter Brennan&#x27;s part as the alcoholic sidekick, although Sloane&#x27;s interpretation was less overtly comedic than Brennan&#x27;s. The movie features a bravura performance by Eddie Albert as a charismatic villain. Pauline Kael and Bosley Crowther have claimed that the ending was used for John Huston&#x27;s film &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948); Kael also said that &quot;One Trip Across&quot; was made into &quot;The Gun Runners&quot; (1958).

In 1987 the Iranian director Nasser Taghvai adapted the novel into a nationalized version called &quot;Captain Khorshid&quot; which took the events from Cuba to the shores of the Persian Gulf.

Season 1 episode 12 (&quot;Fury at Rio Hondo&quot;) of the television show &quot;Cheyenne&quot; is a shorter version of the same story set in Mexico in the Old West, with a screenplay by William Faulkner and James Gunn.

<doc id="919082" wikidata="Q5310380" url="?curid=919082" title="Duane Reade">
<text>Duane Reade Inc. ( ) is a chain of pharmacy and convenience stores owned by Walgreens. Its stores are primarily in New York (metropolitan New York City and Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, and Fairfield counties) in addition to in New Jersey. They are known for high-volume and small store layouts in densely populated Manhattan locations. In 2012, the company headquarters moved to 40 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan which is the location of its newest flagship store.

==History==
Founded in 1960, the chain was started with three stores by Abraham, Eli, and Jack Cohen with a warehouse located between Duane Street and Reade Street on Broadway in Lower Manhattan. Duane Reade takes its name from the company&#x27;s first successful full-service drugstore, which opened in 1960 on Broadway between Duane and Reade Streets in Tribeca, just north of the Financial District. The streets themselves were named after early American politicians, James Duane (1733–1797) and Joseph Reade (1694–1771).

The Cohen family sold Duane Reade to Bain Capital in 1992 for a reported $239 million. Bain Capital in 1997 then sold the majority ownership of the chain to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Duane Reade completed its initial public offering (IPO) on February 10, 1998, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DRD. On August 2, 2004, the company announced that it was acquired by Oak Hill Capital Partners and was again a private company.

Gary Charboneau, the company&#x27;s senior vice president of sales and marketing since 1993, explained his store layout strategy in &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 2005. He designed each store using four sections: one for beauty and cosmetic products, another that serves as a pharmacy, a third section for seasonal products such as cards and candy, and a fourth part for household and grocery items. Cosmetic items were placed near store entrances, pharmacy sections were moved to the rear of stores since—according to Charboneau—&quot;people don’t browse for prescriptions&quot;, and the other two sections occupied the remaining space. Ian Mount wrote in the magazine article, &quot;half of Duane Reade’s sales come from food, cosmetics, and the like.&quot;

Under CEO Anthony Cuti, who had been the president of Pathmark, the store expanded from 59 stores in 1996 to 249 stores in May 2005, with more stores in New York City than any other drugstore chain. In September 1998, Duane Reade acquired Rock Bottom Stores Inc, another drug retail chain with 38 retail stores, for $30 million plus an additional $31 million for the store&#x27;s inventories. While sales for Duane Reade rose from $1.14 billion in 2001 fiscal year to $1.38 billion in 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duane-Reade-Inc-Jun-2004-10-K/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the combined impact of union disputes, a local recession, and the destruction of their best-performing store in the September 11 attacks forced the company to slow its expansion from 30 new stores a year in 2001 and 2002 to no more than 17 a year in 2003 and 2004. Despite its expansion, the company had long-term debts of $405 million by October 2008, losing $33.1 million in the first half of that year. Almost all of its stores are located in New York City or the immediate suburbs.

On April 19, 2006, it was announced that after nearly five years, Duane Reade agreed to settle with Disabled In Action to make all of its stores ADA compliant. According to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Duane Reade estimated it would take two years to inspect and revamp its stores for wheelchair access. In November 2008, Duane Reade began rolling out a new logo. In April 2009, Duane Reade hired DeVito/Verdi as its lead advertising agency.

On April 9, 2010, Duane Reade was acquired by the Walgreen Company for $1.075 billion, consisting of $618 million in cash and $427 million of assumed debt. The transaction includes Duane Reade corporate office, 257 stores, and two distribution centers. On July 6, 2011, Duane Reade opened a location at 40 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.

==Litigation and disputes==
Duane Reade and its executives have been involved in various disputes over its business practices with federal and local governments and labor unions.

Two unions and Duane Reade Inc. struck a deal on April 11, 2006, to close a five-year contract dispute. The three-year agreement covers &quot;all of Duane Reade&#x27;s clerks, cashiers, pharmacy clerks, pharmacy technicians, and photo technicians&quot;, and it closes a dispute dating from September 2001, when their previous contract expired. As part of the deal, Duane Reade and the unions settled all outstanding union and company claims before the National Labor Relations Board.

In November 1997, the company settled charges that it sold drugs and other products in its New Jersey stores that were expired or overpriced. It agreed to pay $200,000 in civil penalties, investigative costs, and fees and to comply with the state&#x27;s laws and regulations but did not admit wrongdoing.

Its embattled CEO Anthony Cuti, along with former CFO William Tennant, were indicted on October 9, 2008, in Manhattan federal court for falsely reporting company income and conspiring to commit securities fraud from December 2000 to June 2005. Cuti had already been replaced in November 2005 by industry veteran Richard Dreiling, COO of Longs Drugs stores based in the San Francisco area. In June 2010, Cuti and Tennant were convicted of securities fraud between November 2000 and June 2005. They faced up to 20 years in prison. Cuti was sentenced to three years in prison on November 15, 2010; Tennant was sentenced in September 2011 to time served, supervised release for three years, and a $10,000 fine.

== Controversies ==

=== Zifeng Li&#x27;s Controversial Research ===
Prof. Zifeng Li&#x27;s 2021 research, titled &quot;Advancing Newtonian Physics by Upholding a Materialist Perspective on Spacetime and Energy-Matter&quot;, aimed to challenge Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity but faced skepticism due to the established verification of the theory. His work was recommended for Hebei Province Science and Technology Award despite facing several unsuccessful grant applications. Furthermore, the academic community have questioned the integrity of Prof. Li&#x27;s research practices. Reportedly, Prof. Zifeng Li steadfastly rejects relativity, using his position to promote his theories in class. Allegedly, students who disagreed were unfairly graded, leading to a severe teaching incident. YSU criticized Li, imposing a 3-year undergraduate teaching suspension in 2017.

<text>The Hebei University of Economics and Business (HUEB; ) is a provincial public university in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. It is affiliated with the Province of Hebei and sponsored by the provincial government.

== History ==

=== Hebei Trade &amp; Finance Institute (since 1953) ===
Hebei Trade &amp; Finance Institute traces its roots back to the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Society Cooperative School in Shijiazhuang in 1953. In 1958, it was renamed as the &quot;Hebei Province School of Business and Technical Cadres.&quot; Following a merger with the Provincial Grain School in 1959, it was transformed into the &quot;Hebei Province School of Finance and Trade Technical Cadres.&quot; Building upon this foundation in 1960, the &quot;Hebei Province School of Commerce&quot; was established, but due to historical reasons, it ceased operations after 1965. The institution was re-established as the &quot;Hebei Province School of Commerce&quot; in 1973. Expanding on this, the Hebei College of Finance and Trade was founded in 1978 on the basis of the Hebei Province School of Commerce, and it was renamed the Hebei Trade &amp; Finance Institute in 1984.

=== Hebei College of Trade &amp; Economics (since 1968) ===

Due to specific circumstances, enrollment was temporarily suspended in 1965. In 1982, the Hebei Provincial Business Cadre School was reestablished and operated at the same location as the Hebei Provincial School of Commerce.

Other universities of similar academic quality, such as North China University of Science and Technology and Hebei University of Science and Technology, already have or are in the process of obtaining the right to confer doctoral degrees. With even lower admission requirements and academic quality, the Hebei University of Engineering in Handan has also received a special project doctoral program.

<doc id="919129" wikidata="Q1503215" url="?curid=919129" title="Allan Quatermain">
<text>Allan Quatermain is the protagonist of H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s 1885 novel &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, its one sequel &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; (1887), twelve prequel novels and four prequel short stories, totalling eighteen works. An English professional big game hunter and adventurer, in film and television he has been portrayed by Richard Chamberlain, Sean Connery, Cedric Hardwicke, Patrick Swayze and Stewart Granger among others.

== History ==

The character Quatermain is an English-born professional big game hunter and occasional trader living in South Africa. An outdoorsman who finds English cities and climate unbearable, he prefers to spend most of his life in Africa, where he grew up under the care of his widower father, a Christian missionary.

In the earliest-written novels, native Africans refer to Quatermain as &quot;Macumazahn&quot;, meaning &quot;Watcher-by-Night,&quot; a reference to his nocturnal habits and keen instincts. In later-written novels, Macumazahn is said to be a short form of &quot;Macumazana&quot;, meaning &quot;One who stands out.&quot; Quatermain is frequently accompanied by his native servant, the Hottentot Hans, a wise and caring family retainer from his youth. His sarcastic comments offer a sharp critique of European conventions. In his final adventures, Quatermain is joined by two British companions, Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good of the Royal Navy, and by his Zulu friend Umslopogaas.

=== Appearance and character ===
The series spans 50 years of Quatermain&#x27;s life, from 18 to 68; at the start of the foundation novel &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; he has just turned 55, giving him a birthdate of 1830. Physically, he is small, wiry, and unattractive, with a beard and short hair that sticks up. His one skill is his marksmanship, where he has no equal. Quatermain is aware that as a professional hunter, he has helped to destroy his beloved wild free places of Africa. In old age he hunts without pleasure, having no other means of making a living.

About Quatermain&#x27;s family, little is written. He lives at Durban, in Natal, South Africa. He marries twice, but is quickly widowed both times. He entrusts the printing of memoirs in the series to his son Harry, whose death he mourns in the opening of the novel &quot;Allan Quatermain.&quot; Harry Quatermain is a medical student who dies of smallpox while working in a hospital. Haggard did not write the Quatermain novels in chronological order, and made errors with some details. Quatermain&#x27;s birth, age at the time of his marriages, and age at the time of his death cannot be reconciled to the apparent date of Harry&#x27;s birth and age at death.

== Series ==

=== Composition ===
Haggard wrote fourteen novels and four short stories featuring Quatermain, beginning with &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885). From 1885 to 1889 he wrote four of the novels and three of the short stories, including &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and its sequel &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; (1887). Haggard wrote this sequel in the summer of 1885, immediately after producing &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, but &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; was only published two years later in 1887. The other Quatermain stories from this period are &quot;Hunter Quatermain&#x27;s Story&quot; (1885), &quot;Long Odds&quot; (1886), &quot;A Tale of Three Lions&quot; (1887), &quot;Maiwa&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1888), and &quot;Allan&#x27;s Wife and Other Tales&quot; (1889). The latter book collected the previous short stories as well as a new novelette. After the publication of &quot;Allan&#x27;s Wife&quot;, Haggard abandoned the Quatermain series for two decades. Then, from around April to August 1909, Haggard wrote &quot;Child of Storm&quot;, originally intending it to be a stand-alone Quatermain novel. However, during or after its composition, Haggard decided to make &quot;Child of Storm&quot; the second part of a trilogy of new Quatermain books, beginning with &quot;Marie&quot;, published in 1912. &quot;Marie&quot; was the first new Quatermain story for twenty-three years. It was followed by a short story, &quot;Magepa the Buck&quot; (1912), and then by &quot;Child of Storm&quot; (1913), published four years after its composition in mid-1909. Haggard continued to write more Quatermain stories until his death in 1925; the final two books in the series, &quot;The Treasure of the Lake&quot; (1926) and &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot; (1927), were published posthumously.

=== Subdivisions ===

Although some of Haggard&#x27;s Quatermain novels stand alone, there are a few important sub-series. In the Zulu trilogy, &quot;Marie&quot; (1912), &quot;Child of Storm&quot; (1913), and &quot;Finished&quot; (1917), Quatermain becomes ensnared in the vengeance of Zikali, the dwarf wizard known as &quot;the-thing-that-should-never-have-been-born&quot; and &quot;Opener-of-Roads.&quot; Zikali plots and finally achieves the overthrow of the Zulu royal House of Senzangakona, founded by Chaka and ending under Cetewayo (Cetshwayo kaMpande) (Haggard&#x27;s spelling of Zulu names is used in the first instance, with the currently used versions in brackets).

These novels are prequels to the foundation pair, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885) and &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; (1887), which describe Quatermain&#x27;s discovery of vast wealth, his discontent with a life of ease, and his return to Africa following the death of his son Harry.

&quot;The Holy Flower&quot; (1915) paved the way for a trilogy of Quatermain books involving the &quot;Taduki&quot; drug, which induces clairvoyance and visions: &quot;The Ivory Child&quot; (1916), &quot;The Ancient Allan&quot; (1920), and &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot; (1927). The latter two books involve Quatermain experiencing his past lives through the use of &quot;Taduki&quot;.

With &quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921), Haggard engineered a crossover between his two most popular series, uniting Quatermain with Ayesha, the central character of his hugely successful &quot;&quot; novels, and bringing in several other key characters from each series—Hans, Umslopogaas, and Zikali from the Quatermain series, and Billali, Ayesha&#x27;s faithful minister. This book formed the third part of the &quot;She&quot; trilogy, although in chronological terms, it necessarily served as a prequel to the first two &quot;She&quot; books, since Allan Quatermain&#x27;s meeting with Ayesha in &quot;She and Allan&quot; is implied to be before the discovery of Kôr by Ludwig Horace Holly and Leo Vincey as narrated in &quot;&quot;, the first Ayesha book.

=== Summaries of the stories ===

&quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885) 

A sixty-year-old Allan Quatermain travels with two fellow Englishmen (Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good) through a remote region of southern Africa with the aim of locating Curtis&#x27; missing brother and the lost diamond mines of King Solomon. They cross plains, deserts and mountain ranges on their quest. Quatermain, Curtis and Good reach the lost kingdom of Kukuanaland, inhabited by a warlike race related to the Zulus, and find themselves involved in a bloody struggle for the Kukuana throne.
&quot;Hunter Quatermain&#x27;s Story&quot; (1885)

At a dinner-party in Yorkshire, Quatermain recounts a memorable encounter with a buffalo he once had on a South African hunting expedition. The short story features Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good as minor characters. It also includes a character called the Hottentot Hans, but this is not the same Hottentot Hans who appeared in &quot;Marie&quot; (1912) and its sequels.
&quot;Long Odds&quot; (1886)

Quatermain describes how a lion mauled his leg on a hunting expedition. This event is referenced in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and other stories several times.
&quot;Allan Quatermain: An Account of His Further Adventures and Discoveries in Company with Sir Henry Curtis, Bart., Commander John Good, R.N., and One Umslopogaas&quot; (1887) 

Three years after the events of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, Quatermain, Curtis and Good return to Africa to locate a &quot;great white race&quot; hidden in the heart of the Dark Continent. They travel with Umslopogaas, the mighty Zulu warrior, and find the lost world of Zu-Vendis, inhabited by a race of sun-worshippers possibly descended from ancient Persians or Phoenicians. Chronologically this is the last of the Quatermain stories, although it was published early on; Haggard did not write the stories in chronological order. 
&quot;A Tale of Three Lions&quot; (1887)

In the third of the four Allan Quatermain short stories, Quatermain and his son Harry prospect for gold and seek revenge for their faithful servant Jim-Jim after he is killed by a lion.
&quot;Maiwa&#x27;s Revenge; or, The War of the Little Hand&quot; (1888)

Quatermain aids the African queen Maiwa in a war of vengeance after her infant son is murdered. 
&quot;Allan&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1889)

This novella tells the story of Allan Quatermain&#x27;s youth in Africa, and of his marriage to Stella Carson. The story involves Quatermain&#x27;s father, as well as the Zulu character Indaba-zimbi and the evil baboon-woman Hendrika. Hendrika is conjectured to have influenced Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Mowgli and Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Tarzan. While this is speculation, Kipling acknowledged that Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Nada the Lily&quot; (1892) was vital in his creation of Mowgli.
&quot;Marie: An Episode in the Life of the Late Allan Quatermain&quot; (1912)

After a twenty-three-year hiatus during which no new Quatermain stories were published, the hunter returned in &quot;Marie&quot;, which describes his love for Marie Marais, a Boer woman, as well as his involvement in events in Zulu history. &quot;Marie&quot; was the first book in the Zulu Trilogy and introduced the Hottentot Hans, who was Quatermain&#x27;s companion in five further books: &quot;The Holy Flower&quot; (1915), &quot;The Ivory Child&quot; (1916), &quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921), &quot;Heu-Heu; or, The Monster&quot; (1924), and &quot;The Treasure of the Lake&quot; (1926).
&quot;Magepa the Buck&quot; (1912)

In the final short story, Quatermain recounts the bravery of the titular Zulu character, who undertook an admirable feat of endurance to save the life of a child. &quot;Magepa the Buck&quot; was collected in the 1921 Haggard book &quot;Smith and the Pharaohs&quot;.
&quot;Child of Storm&quot; (1913)

In this book, the sequel to &quot;Marie&quot; and second volume in the Zulu Trilogy, Allan Quatermain becomes involved in the political rivalries between the Zulu princes. The book introduced Zikali, the Zulu dwarf-wizard first mentioned in &quot;Marie&quot;.

&quot;The Holy Flower&quot; (1915)

Quatermain and Hans travel with the Zulu Mavovo and the young British collector Stephen Somers in quest of a giant orchid worshipped by a lost race called the Pongo. The book involves battles with Arab slave-traders, cannibalism, occultism, and a huge gorilla-god.
&quot;The Ivory Child&quot; (1916)

In the sequel to &quot;The Holy Flower&quot;, Allan Quatermain meets Lord George Ragnall and his beautiful &quot;fiancée&quot;, Luna Holmes, but the latter is kidnapped by the wizard Harût while in Egypt. Quatermain, Hans, Ragnall and his servant Savage reach the lost world of Kendahland, Harût&#x27;s homeland, to rescue Lady Ragnall. The two Kendah tribes are at war, as one faction worships &quot;the Child,&quot; an idol representing the Egyptian god Horus, and the other faction sacrifices to Jana, a giant prehistoric elephant or god who Harût says is the same entity as the Egyptian Set and the Abrahamic Satan. &quot;The Ivory Child&quot; is the first book in the series to involve the &quot;Taduki&quot; drug, a mystical herb which induces clairvoyant visions. (Robert E. Howard, who admired Haggard&#x27;s work, later referenced this drug in one of his own early fragments.)

&quot;Finished&quot; (1917)

In the final part of the Zulu Trilogy, Zikali wreaks revenge on the royal Zulu house. The book is during the Zulu War of 1879, and includes Allan Quatermain as a fighter at Isandhlwana.
&quot;The Ancient Allan&quot; (1920)

In the sequel to &quot;The Ivory Child&quot;, Allan Quatermain and Lady Luna Ragnall take the &quot;Taduki&quot; drug and witness previous incarnations of themselves as well as of other characters from the series (the Hottentot Hans, Lord Ragnall, Harût and Jana) in Egypt under Achaemenid Persian rule. Along with its sequel &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot;, this is the only book in the Allan Quatermain series not to be set in nineteenth century Africa.
&quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921)

Quatermain, Hans, Umslopogaas and a Scotsman by the name of Robertson travel to Kôr, where they meet Ayesha from Haggard&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1887) and its sequel &quot;&quot; (1905). The book features a gripping battle between Umslopogaas and the demon Rezu, as well as philosophical discussions between Allan and Ayesha, and a journey made by Allan and Umslopogaas to the land of the dead. Haggard wrote one more Ayesha book, &quot;Wisdom&#x27;s Daughter: The Life and Love Story of She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed&quot; (1923), but it did not feature Quatermain.
&quot;Heu-Heu; or, The Monster&quot; (1924)

In &quot;Heu-Heu&quot;, Allan and Hans encounter a grotesque cave-painting in southern Africa depicting a fiendish gorilla-monster called Heu-Heu. Zikali then sends the pair to Heuheualand, the home of Heu-Heu, to obtain a powerful drug he claims to be even stronger than &quot;Taduki&quot;, and to rescue the daughter of a lost race&#x27;s chief from being sacrificed to Heu-Heu.
&quot;The Treasure of the Lake&quot; (1926)

In this posthumously published Quatermain adventure, Allan and Hans travel with a strange sorcerer called Kaneke to Mone-land. This strange lost world is located in the crater of a volcano and is inhabited by the Dabanda people (the nation to whom Kaneke himself belongs), who have attained to high mystical powers and who worship a goddess living on an island in Lake Mone. Allan and Hans meet an Englishman called John Taurus Arkle, who becomes the Chieftain of the Dabanda. While they are in Mone-land they experience many strange and frightening displays of occult powers.
&quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods: A Tale of Beginnings&quot; (1927)

In this sequel to &quot;The Ancient Allan&quot;, Quatermain again takes the &quot;Taduki&quot; drug, and witnesses his life in the last great Ice Age, when he was a chieftain called Wi. &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot; is the last Quatermain story, and Haggard&#x27;s friend Rudyard Kipling helped him with the plot. It is set shortly before the events of &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot;.

=== Related works by Haggard ===

The Ayesha Series (1887 – 1923)


The Ayesha series comprises four adventure novels by Haggard: &quot;&quot; (1887), &quot;&quot; (1905), &quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921), and &quot;Wisdom&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1923). Of these only &quot;She and Allan&quot; is part of the Quatermain series, although Quatermain is mentioned in &quot;Wisdom&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. (In the opening lines of that book, Ayesha refers to &quot;one Allan, a wandering hunter of beasts and a fighting man of good blood who visited me at Kôr, though of this I said nothing to Holly or to my lord Kallikrates, now known as Leo or the Lion, because as to this Allan I held it wiser to be silent.&quot;) The books tell the story of Ayesha, a beautiful and immortal sorceress from ancient Arabia who travelled throughout the ancient world, finally concealing herself in the ruins of the city of Kôr around 339 BC. Here she killed the man she loved, Kallikrates, in a fit of jealousy, and was forced to await his reincarnation in the dim vaults and tombs of the dead city for two thousand years. The return of her lover is the premise of &quot;She&quot; and &quot;Ayesha&quot;, while the other two books are set before Kallikrates&#x27; reincarnation.
&quot;Nada the Lily&quot; (1892)

&quot;Nada the Lily&quot; is a historical fantasy and adventure romance set in Zululand and surrounding areas under the rule of two of its kings, Chaka (ruled 1816 – 1828) and Dingaan (r. 1828 – 1840). It narrates the story of the youth of Umslopogaas as told by his foster-father, the witch-doctor Mopo. Allan Quatermain is mentioned in the final pages of the book under his Zulu name, Macumazahn.
&quot;Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll&quot; (1900)

The novella &quot;Black Heart and White Heart&quot; was collected in the book &quot;Elissa&quot;. While it bears no obvious connexion to the Quatermain series, it is set in Zululand and features similar characters.
&quot;The Ghost Kings&quot; (1908)

&quot;The Ghost Kings&quot; is set near Zululand and involves Mopo from &quot;Nada the Lily&quot;, meaning it is in the same universe as the Quatermain series.

=== Themes ===
All but two of the Quatermain stories are set in Africa in a period spanning the 1830s to the 1880s. Most or indeed all of the books include battles and other large-scale military engagements.

In the Quatermain stories, as in the rest of Haggard&#x27;s oeuvre – he wrote fifty-eight fiction books in total, as well as several volumes of non-fiction – the action is interspersed with philosophical reflections. Quatermain frequently enters into monologues wherein he muses on many subjects, among them Africa, God, Fate, morality, and life.

In his essay &quot;H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s Character Hans the Hottentot,&quot; Thomas Kent Miller writes that &quot;Haggard successfully made Fate a character in many of his books. It seemed to me that his stories did not come alive due to characterizations or plot developments so much as they did to turnings of Fate.&quot;

&quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot;, &quot;The Holy Flower&quot;, &quot;The Ivory Child&quot;, &quot;She and Allan&quot;, &quot;Heu-Heu&quot;, and &quot;The Treasure of the Lake&quot; all are examples of the lost world or lost race subgenre. Although the idea of lost peoples had precedents in earlier stories such as Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; (1838) and Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s &quot;The Coming Race&quot; (1871), the lost world tale was largely invented and popularised by Haggard. Aside from the Quatermain lost world stories, Haggard wrote several other books in the same subgenre. His other lost world-lost race romances are &quot;&quot; (1887), &quot;The People of the Mist&quot; (1894), &quot;Heart of the World&quot; (1895), &quot;&quot; (1905), &quot;Benita: An African Romance&quot; (1906), &quot;The Ghost Kings&quot; (1908), &quot;The Yellow God: An Idol of Africa&quot; (1908), &quot;Queen Sheba&#x27;s Ring&quot; (1910), and &quot;When the World Shook&quot; (1919). Scores of writers followed Haggard&#x27;s lost world formula, among them his friends Rudyard Kipling and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as such authors as C. J.

Mysticism and occultism are prevalent in the Quatermain stories and other works by Haggard. They frequently take the form of metempsychosis, telepathy, elements related to Ancient Egypt and its religion, and the Zulu religion. A common theme relating to metempsychosis and reincarnation in Haggard&#x27;s works is what R.D. Mullen the &quot;recurring triangle.&quot; In Mullen&#x27;s words:
== Chronology of Haggard&#x27;s Allan Quatermain, Ayesha, Mopo, and Umslopogaas stories ==

Dates of events in Allan Quatermain&#x27;s life and Ayesha&#x27;s are given as &quot;Chronological year&quot; (left). Dates of first publication in book form are given as &quot;Publication year&quot; (right).

The four Ayesha novels are marked (*). Allan Quatermain and Umslopogaas appears only in &quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921), third-published of the four and second in the Ayesha chronology.

The three Umslopogaas novels are marked (**). Ayesha appears only in &quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921), third-published of the three and second in the Umslopogaas chronology. Allan appears there and in &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; (1887), first-published of the three and last in the Umslopogaas chronology—as in Allan&#x27;s own. That story is set in 1884–1885; only &quot;Ayesha: The Return of She&quot; (1905) is set later, in 1899.

== Major characters in Haggard&#x27;s Ayesha, Allan Quatermain and Umslopogaas stories ==

=== Allan Quatermain ===
Allan Quatermain is also known by his Zulu name Macumazahn or Macumazana, meaning Watcher-by-Night or He-Who-Sleeps-With-One-Eye-Open. He is the hero of eighteen works by Haggard, and is a British big game hunter who explores Southern, Central and East Africa, discovering several lost worlds there, among them Kukuanaland, Zu-Vendis, Mazituland and Pongoland, Kendahland, Kôr, Heuheualand and Walloo, and Mone-land. In the latter part of his career Quatermain takes the &quot;Taduki&quot; drug, enabling him to see visions of his past lives in prehistoric Europe, ancient Egypt and other locales.

In the first chapter of &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot;, the hunter describes himself thus:
=== Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good===

Sir Henry Curtis, Bart., and Captain John Good, R.N., are two Englishmen who accompany Allan Quatermain to Kukuanaland and the mines of Solomon, three years later journeying again with Quatermain to the land of Zu-Vendis. Curtis and Good appear in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot;, &quot;Maiwa&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Allan&#x27;s Wife and Other Tales&quot;, &quot;Heu-Heu&quot;, and &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot;. Curtis, whose Zulu name is Incubu, is described as being a giant of a man, while Good (known by the natives as Bougwan) is a former naval officer who wears an eye-glass and has a dry sense of humour.

In the first chapter of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, Curtis is described thus:
In the same chapter, Good is described as:
=== Ludwig Horace Holly ===
Ludwig Horace Holly is a professor at Cambridge, born in 1841. In 1863 he adopted Leo Vincey, with whom he journeyed in East and Central Africa from 1883 to 1885, discovering the lost city of Kôr. Holly has a reputation for ugliness, and is called &quot;Charon&quot; by his colleagues at Cambridge, and &quot;the Baboon&quot; by the residents of Kôr. In 1903 Holly and Vincey discovered the city of Kaloon in Central Asia.

In the Introduction to &quot;She&quot;, Holly&#x27;s appearance is detailed:
=== Leo Vincey ===
Born in 1858, at five years old Leo Vincey, the son of an Englishman and a Greek woman, is adopted by Ludwig Horace Holly, who he comes to love dearly as he grows into manhood. Vincey is very handsome, with curly yellow hair, and is compared to the statue of a Greek god come to life. He is a descendant and reincarnation of the fictional Greco-Egyptian priest Kallikrates. Holly and Leo appear in two books, &quot;&quot; (1887) and its sequel, &quot;&quot; (1905).

In the Introduction to &quot;She&quot;, Haggard describes Leo Vincey:
=== Billali ===
Billali is a chieftain of one of the main Amahagger clans (the Amahagger being the Arabic-speaking inhabitants of Kôr, who worship Ayesha). He is a faithful servant of Ayesha, and is the kind host of Holly and Leo in &quot;She&quot;, and of Allan Quatermain in &quot;She and Allan&quot;.

In the sixth chapter of &quot;She&quot;, Holly describes seeing Billali for the first time:
=== Ayesha ===
Ayesha (pronounced &quot;Assha&quot;), also known as &quot;Hiya&quot; or &quot;She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed&quot;, is a woman born in Arabia in the fourth century BC. She possesses extreme beauty, and the Arab tribes fought viciously over her. She travelled throughout the ancient world, staying at one point in Greece and at another in Egypt, where she became the head priestess of the goddess Isis and acquired strong influence on the country, to the extent that she was the pharaoh in all but name. She eventually moved to the ruins of Kôr in a part of Africa &quot;about a hundred and seventy miles&quot; north of the Zambesi. Kôr was an ancient civilisation antedating and perhaps even founding that of Egypt. It was in the ruins of Kôr that Ayesha became the disciple of an old philosopher called Noot, who had found the secret to almost eternal life, but forbade both himself and others from exploiting this secret to gain extreme longevity. When Noot died Ayesha went to the source of life he had found, a mystical pillar of fire located in the depths of a mountain cave-system, and she bathed in its flames. She left the flames more beautiful even than she had been before, but then spent two millennia awaiting the reincarnation of Kallikrates, a priest whom she loved but killed in jealousy at the very moment she gained immortality in or around 339 BC. In Kôr she was worshipped by the Amahagger people, who inhabited the area surrounding its ruins. She wears a veil to prevent men being blinded by her beauty. Ayesha appears in a series of four novels: &quot;&quot; (1887), &quot;&quot; (1905), &quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921), and &quot;Wisdom&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1923).

In the thirteenth chapter of &quot;She&quot;, Ayesha unveils to Holly, and he describes her appearance in detail:
=== Umslopogaas ===
Umslopogaas is a Zulu warrior of immense strength and physical stature, known as the bravest man in Zululand. He is the unacknowledged son of Chaka. In his youth Umslopogaas leaves Zululand and spends a time living with a wolf-pack and a man called Galazi. The two men develop a strong bond and come to call themselves brothers. Umslopogaas then becomes the chieftain of a tribe called the People of the Axe, winning the great axe of their village in fair fight. This weapon is held by Umslopogaas for the rest of his life, and is referred to variously as &quot;the Woodpecker&quot; (due to the way Umslopogaas uses it to poke holes in his enemies&#x27; heads) and &quot;Inkosi-kaas&quot; (chieftainess). When visiting the lost city of Kôr with Quatermain and Hans in &quot;She and Allan&quot;, Umslopogaas slays the demon Rezu with the axe. Umslopogaas is chief of the People of the Axe for several years, but is eventually forced to flee north, though he takes his axe with him. Umslopogaas appears in three books: &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; (1887), &quot;Nada the Lily&quot; (1892), and &quot;She and Allan&quot; (1921).

=== Mopo ===
Mopo, also called Zweete, is a Zulu witch-doctor in the days of Chaka. He fosters Umslopogaas, the son of Chaka, as his own son to prevent him being killed by his real father, who murdered his own children to prevent any of them from living to challenge his rule. After most of his family is killed by Chaka and he is tortured by him, Mopo assassinates the Zulu king in revenge, with the help of the princes Dingaan and Umhlangana. Mopo and Umslopogaas later kill King Dingaan to avenge the death of Nada, Umslopogaas&#x27; most beloved wife. Haggard based Mopo on a real person, and the character appears in &quot;Nada the Lily&quot; (1892) and &quot;The Ghost Kings&quot; (1908).

=== The Four Zulu Kings ===
The real-life kings of the Zulus between 1816 and 1879 appear as characters in Haggard&#x27;s works. Chaka is the antagonist of &quot;Nada the Lily&quot;, where he is described as &quot;(t)he Zulu Napoleon, one of the greatest geniuses and most wicked men who ever lived. He was killed in the year 1828, having slaughtered more than a million human beings.&quot; (While many agree the number was around one million, some modern estimates place the number of people Chaka killed at something closer to two million.) In &quot;Nada the Lily&quot;, Haggard portrays Chaka as a paranoid psychopath, and was for the most part historically accurate in describing the actions of the king; for example, it is true that he killed seven thousand people after his mother died because he accused them of not showing enough grief. However, it is not true that Chaka killed his mother, as is depicted in the book. Haggard did not intend to be true to history in every detail, but his descriptions of Zulu history, culture and politics are mostly accurate. Dingaan, the second Zulu king, also appears as a character, and he too is shown to be a tyrant, though he is described as lacking the greatness which characterised Chaka. He appears in &quot;Nada the Lily&quot; and &quot;Marie&quot;. Panda, who ruled from 1840 to 1872, is described as &quot;a man of peace,&quot; while Cetywayo appears as a character in &quot;Black Heart and White Heart&quot;, &quot;Finished&quot;, and other Quatermain adventures.

=== Amenartas === 
Amenartas is an ancient Egyptian princess with whom the priest Kallikrates fell in love. It was for Kallikrates&#x27; love of Amenartas that the jealous Ayesha killed him. Ayesha, Kallikrates and Amenartas form the most important &quot;recurring triangle&quot; in Haggard&#x27;s work, as they repeat their affairs through different incarnations, the two women vying to win Kallikrates&#x27; affection. Amenartas appears in &quot;&quot;, where she is called Atene, and in &quot;Wisdom&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In &quot;Ayesha&quot;, it is said that Amenartas was even more beautiful than Ayesha until the latter bathed in the flame of life, at which point Ayesha&#x27;s beauty exceeded that of all other women who had ever lived.

=== Hans ===
The Hottentot Hans is a recurring character in the Allan Quatermain series, appearing as the hunter&#x27;s friend and sidekick in &quot;Marie&quot;, &quot;The Holy Flower&quot;, &quot;The Ivory Child&quot;, &quot;She and Allan&quot;, &quot;Heu-Heu&quot;, and &quot;The Treasure of the Lake&quot;. Earlier incarnations of Hans appear in &quot;The Ancient Allan&quot;, where he is an ancient Ethiopian called Bes, and &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot;, wherein he is a caveman called Pag. Hans is described as a short and ugly individual of unknown age, though apparently old. Hans is cunning, wise, humorous and very devoted to Quatermain, who he has served since the hunter was a child; his conversations with Allan provide much wit, but also plenty of food for thought. Throughout the series, Hans appears as Allan&#x27;s companion more frequently than any other character, and the relationship between the pair is imbued with emotional power.

=== Zikali ===
Zikali is a Zulu dwarf and witch-doctor referred to as the &quot;Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born&quot; and the &quot;Opener-of-Roads.&quot; He is first mentioned in &quot;Marie&quot; and appears as a character in &quot;Child of Storm&quot;, &quot;Finished&quot;, &quot;She and Allan&quot;, and &quot;Heu-Heu&quot;. Zikali is also referenced in such books as &quot;The Holy Flower&quot; and &quot;The Treasure of the Lake&quot;. He plots to bring about the fall of the royal house of the Zulus. He possesses occult powers and claims to be in touch with sorcerers throughout Africa; in &quot;She and Allan&quot; he appears to be able to communicate with Ayesha through dreams. Zikali is described as very unpleasant in appearance, resembling a huge toad. He possesses a hideous wooden charm, a carved likeness of himself called the &quot;Great Medicine,&quot; which he claims his spirit can enter and inhabit and which protects any who wear it. The Great Medicine appears in &quot;She and Allan&quot;. It has been known and feared throughout Zululand for centuries. Umslopogaas&#x27; reaction upon seeing Allan Quatermain wearing the Great Medicine is described thus: 

=== Mameena ===
Mameena is a Zulu woman of exceptional beauty who is a major character in &quot;Child of Storm&quot;, and who is mentioned in several later novels, such as &quot;The Ivory Child&quot;. Desire to take her to wife causes violence among the Zulus, and she is compared to Helen of Troy.

=== Harût ===
Harût is a wizard in &quot;The Ivory Child&quot;. His tribe is the White Kendah, who worship an idol called the Ivory Child. They are at war with the Black Kendah, who worship the devil Jana. The Child requires a prophetess or oracle to speak its mind, and it is to this end that Harût kidnaps Lady Luna Ragnall, making her the oracle of the Child. An early incarnation of Harût appears in &quot;The Ancient Allan&quot; under the name of the Tanofir, an Egyptian holy man who meditates and foresees the future.

=== Lady Luna Ragnall ===
Lady Luna Ragnall (née Luna Holmes) is the wife of Lord George Ragnall, an aristocratic Englishman. She is mentioned in &quot;The Holy Flower&quot; but first appears in &quot;The Ivory Child&quot;. She has clairvoyant abilities, and has from childhood felt a strange connexion to Egypt. She is a reincarnation of the Lady Amada, an ancient Egyptian noblewoman. On her breast is a mark in the shape of a crescent moon, and this symbol leads Harût to take her to Kendahland. For some years she stays there as an oracle, and loses all memory of her life beforehand; but at the end of &quot;The Ivory Child&quot; her memory is brought back to her. In &quot;The Ancient Allan&quot; she and Quatermain take the &quot;Taduki&quot; drug and witness some of their previous lives. Lady Ragnall appears for the final time in &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot;.

=== Books written by Alan Moore ===

# &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One&quot; (&quot;Allan and the Sundered Veil&quot;)
# &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II&quot; (&quot;The New Traveller&#x27;s Almanac&quot;)
# &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;
# &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century&quot;

=== Other literary works ===

The Allan Quatermain character has been expanded greatly by modern writers; this use is possibly due to Haggard&#x27;s works passing into the public domain, much like Sherlock Holmes.

One of the Sherlock Holmes pastiches of James Lovegrove, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dust&quot; (2018), features both Holmes and Quatermain.

In 2005, an Allan Quatermain and Sherlock Holmes novel by Thomas Kent Miller, &quot;The Great Detective at the Crucible of Life&quot;, was published by Wildside Press. Miller followed this with &quot;Allan Quatermain at the Dawn of Time&quot; in 2013. These two books were collected, along with Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Great Detective on the Roof of the World&quot; (which features Ludwig Horace Holly and Leo Vincey from Haggard&#x27;s Ayesha stories), in an omnibus entitled &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the Fullness of Time.&quot;

Philip José Farmer and Christopher Paul Carey used elements from Haggard&#x27;s Allan Quatermain and Ayesha stories in their Khokarsa series of prehistoric adventure novels, which link Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Opar to Haggard&#x27;s Kôr and Zu-Vendis and envision Africa in 10,000 BC. The Khokarsa stories include characters from &quot;Allan and the Ice-Gods&quot; and feature the Axe which Umslopogaas wielded in Haggard&#x27;s works. In the works of Farmer and Carey, the Axe is wielded by the character Kwasin.

In 1976, Farmer was interviewed by David Pringle and said of his Khokarsa series:

== Influences ==

The real-life adventures of Frederick Selous, the British big game hunter and explorer of Africa, have often been called the inspiration for Haggard&#x27;s Allan Quatermain. However, Haggard denied that this was the case. In July 1916, he recorded in his diary an exchange between himself and his friend Theodore Roosevelt:
Haggard was influenced by other larger-than-life adventurers whom he later met in Africa, most notably American Scout Frederick Russell Burnham. He was further influenced by South Africa&#x27;s vast mineral wealth and by the ruins of ancient lost civilizations being uncovered in Africa, such as Great Zimbabwe. The similarities are striking between Haggard&#x27;s close friend Burnham and his Quatermain character: both were small and wiry Victorian adventurers in Africa; both sought and discovered ancient treasures and civilizations; both battled large wild animals and native peoples; both were renowned for their ability to track, even at night; and both men had similar nicknames (Quatermain, &quot;Watcher-by-Night&quot;; Burnham, &quot;He-who-sees-in-the-dark&quot;).

The beliefs and views of the fictional Quatermain aped those of Haggard himself, and beliefs that were common among the 19th-century Europeans. These include conventional Victorian ideas concerning the superiority of the white race; an admiration for &quot;warrior races,&quot; such as the Zulu; a disdain for natives corrupted by white influences; and a general contempt for Afrikaners (Boers). But in other ways Haggard&#x27;s views were advanced for his times. The first chapter of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; contains an express denunciation of the use of the pejorative term &quot;nigger.&quot; Quatermain frequently encounters natives who are more brave and wise than Europeans, and women (black and white) who are smarter and emotionally stronger than men (though not necessarily as good; cf. the title character of &quot;She&quot;). Through the Quatermain novels and his other works, Haggard also expresses his own mysticism and interest in non-Christian concepts, particularly karma and reincarnation, though he expresses these concepts in such a way as to be compatible with the Christian faith.

== Influenced ==
Quatermain is theorized to be one of the templates for the American film character Indiana Jones.

The route to King Solomon&#x27;s Mines described by Haggard was also referred to in the movie &quot;The Librarian: Return to King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, specifically the reference to Sheba&#x27;s Breasts and Three Witches Mountain, which are geographical features mentioned by Quatermain in the novel.

In the Graham Greene novel &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1948), the main character Scobie remembers Allan Quatermain as his childhood hero.

== In popular culture ==
* The video game &quot;Deadfall Adventures&quot; explores the adventures of James Lee Quatermain, the great-grandson of Allan, in the 1930s.
* Allan Quatermain was a major character in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, a comic book series created by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill. The comics were adapted into a 2003 film of the same name starring former James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery as Quatermain. This was Connery&#x27;s final acting role before his retirement in 2006.

<text>Nanjing Normal University (NJNU; ) is a provincial public university in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. It is affiliated with the Province of Jiangsu, and co-sponsored by the Ministry of Education and the provincial government. The university is part of the Double First-Class Construction and Project 211.

As of 2020, NNU has three campuses in Nanjing, namely Xianlin, Suiyuan, and Zijin. It consists of 28 colleges and schools with an enrollment of 18,369 undergraduates and 12,564 graduate students, including 1,525 doctoral candidates.

==History==

The history of Nanjing Normal University can be traced to 1902 with the establishment of Sanjiang Normal School (三江师范学堂). Sanjiang refers to a historical province in Qing dynasty that roughly covers three provinces in contemporary China, including Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Anhui. The college evolved into Liangjiang Advanced Normal School, National Nanjing Higher Normal School, National Southeastern University, National 4th Sun Yat-sen University, National Jiangsu University, National Central University, and Nanjing University in the following decades.

The other origin of Nanjing Normal University is the University of Nanking which was established in 1888 as Nanking Academy and developed into Private University of Nanking in 1910. It was the first institution in China officially named &quot;university&quot; in English and was registered with the New York State Education Department. In 1951, Private University of Nanking and Private Ginling College, were integrated into the National University of Nanking.

In 1952, as the result of the nationwide reorganization of higher education, some schools and departments of Nanjing University and University of Nanking were separated and merged to establish Nanjing Normal College (南京师范学院), which was set up on the former site of Ginling College. The college then exchanged several academic faculties and departments with Soochow University (Suzhou) in Jiangsu Province, establishing a more robust discipline system for both institutions. In 1984, Nanjing Normal College was renamed Nanjing Normal University (南京师范大学). In 1996, it became one of the first group of universities designated by the Ministry of Education of China in the list of former Project 211 for National Key Universities. In 2000, Nanjing Polytechnic of Power Engineering, a national polytechnic institute governed by the Ministry of Chemical Industry at the time, was incorporated into the university. It is included in the Double First-Class Construction.

==Campus==

Nanjing Normal University has three campuses throughout the urban and suburban areas of Nanjing, China.

<text>Southeast University (SEU) is a public university in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Its precursor, Sanjiang Teachers College, was established in 1902 as a modern university on the campus of an academy which dates back to 258. In 1921, the school changed its name to National Southeast University and became the second national university in China, and in 1928 was renamed to National Central University, the nation&#x27;s flagship university. After the Nationalist government lost Nanjing to the Chinese Communist Party during the Chinese Civil War, the university was renamed as National Nanking University in August 1949. It was renamed Southeast University in May 1988.

==History==
The Imperial Nanjing School, the highest educational institution of kingdom, as the predecessor, was founded in CE 258 in the period of the Three Kingdoms.

=== Sanjiang Normal College (三江师范学堂) (1902–1905) ===
At the end of the 19th century, under the domination of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese society was under the situation of domestic trouble and foreign invasion. In 1901, the Qing government began to reform under this situation, and in 1902 issued &#x27;The imperial rules for colleges&#x27;, and adapted the new modern education system. On 30 May of the same year, the Liangjiang governor Liu Kunyi submitted a document of preparing colleges to the Qing government, proposing to open normal college in Jiangning (Nanjing). In February 1903, the following Liangjiang governor Zhang Zhidong submitted a proposal to open Sanjiang Normal College to government, and authorize Miao Quansun as a representative to Japan for investigation, who later was nominated as the inspector of Sanjiang Normal College and responsible for the project preparation. In September 1903, Sanjiang Normal College officially opened.

=== Liangjiang Normal College (两江师范学堂) (1905–1911) ===

Due to the ambiguous meaning of the college name which led to several disputes, the Sanjiang Normal College was named as Liangjiang Normal College in 1905. The year after, Li Ruiqing was nominated as the principal, who closed the junior normal subjects, and added the public subjects, professional subjects, and also created the first hand-painting subject in China. Until 1907, there had already been Geography-History department, Chinese-Foreign Language Department, Mathematic-Physics- Chemistry Department, and Agriculture Department. At the end of 1911, due to the outbreak of Xinhai Revolution, Liangjiang Normal College was almost closed.

=== National Nanjing Higher Normal School (南京高等师范学校) (1915–1923) ===
On 15 July 1914, Governor Han Guojun appointed Jiang Qian as principal, who was responsible for the starting up of Nanjing Higher Normal School in the same site of Liangjiang Normal College. Jiang employed the US-educated scholar Guo Bingwen as the dean of teaching, Chen Rong as the advisor, and sent both to Europe to investigate the education system and recruit teachers. On 10 September 1915, Nanjing Higher Normal School was officially started. In December 1919, Nanjing Higher Normal School formally recruited 8 female students and 50 more female visiting students, being the first school in China allowing both females and males to study together. The Polytechnic Faculty was established by the school in 1916.
=== National Southeast University (国立东南大学) (1921–1924) ===
In September 1918, Guo Bingwen was the president in the south division. On 7 April 1920, Guo proposed the foundation of the &quot;Southeast University Preparatory Committee&quot;. In September, Guo proposed to the State Council and the Ministry of Education to apply for the establishment of Southeast University, and in December it was approved. On 6 June 1921, the Board of Southeast University was established, Guo as president, and the university was officially opening in September. In December, the school council decided that Nanjing Higher Normal School would be incorporated into Southeast University. Southeast University, based on the foundation of Nanjing Normal Higher School, until 1923, had possessed arts and sciences, Education, engineering, agriculture, business totaling more than 20 lines in 5 subjects. Based on the Polytechnic Faculty of Nanjing Higher Normal School, the Engineering School of National Southeast University was established in 1921.
=== National Hohai Technology University (河海工程专门学校) (1924–1927) ===
In 1924, the Engineering School of National Southeast University merged with the water conservancy school Hohai Engineering School to form National Hohai Technology University, with Mao Yisheng as president.

=== National Central University (国立中央大学) (1927–1949) ===
In 1927, National Hohai Technology University along with several other schools merged with National Southeast University to form National Central University.

=== National Nanjing University (国立南京大学) (1949–1952) ===
In April 1949, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army occupied Nanjing and the Nanjing Military Committee took over National Central University. On 8 August 1949, National Central University was renamed as National Nanjing University, and then Nanjing University in October 1950.

=== Nanjing Institute of Technology (南京工学院) (NIT, 1952–1988) ===
In 1952, the People&#x27;s Republic of China began a national adjustment of its colleges. In Nanjing, the adjustment was mainly on Nanjing University and University of Nanking. Nanjing Institute of Technology was formed in the original site of National Central University from the Engineering School (at the time, the biggest school) of Nanjing University and the engineering departments of University of Nanking, including Chemistry Department and Electrical Machine Department. Later there were also some relevant subjects from Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University, Shandong University, Xiamen University, Fudan University, and Private Jiangnan University merged into Nanjing Institute of Technology.

=== Southeast University (东南大学) (1988 – present) ===
In June 1988, Nanjing Institute of Technology was renamed as &#x27;Southeast University&#x27;, starting to convert from a technology institute to a technology-featured comprehensive university. Since 2000, the name Nanjing Institute of Technology is used by a different institution.

In 2000, Nanjing Railway Medical College, Nanjing Higher Institute of Transportation and Nanjing Geological School were merged into Southeast University.

There are 3 main campuses of Southeast University namely Sipailou Campus, Jiulonghu campus and Dingjiaqiao campus. Sipailou (Xuanwu District) and Dingjiaqiao campus (Gulou district) are in Nanjing city and Jiulonghu campus in suburbs of Nanjing (Jiangning District).

The Sipailou Campus of Southeast University is the flagship campus that is inherited from National Central University. It is located at 2 Sipailou, Nanjing, China. In 1988, Pukou Campus which located in Pukou Campus across the Yangtze River was opened as another site mainly for the education of first and second year students (freshman and sophomores). However, in 2008 Pukou Campus was separated from Southeast University and was then acquired by Cheng Xian Institute.

In 2001, SEU acquired three other colleges in Nanjing. They are: Nanjing Railway Medical College, Nanjing College of Advanced Transportation, as well as Nanjing Advanced School of Geology. Nanjing Railway Medical College became the School of Medicine at Southeast University after it merged with SEU. The medical school is located in Dingjiaqiao.

In 2005, when Jiulonghu Campus, located in Jiangning District, was founded, the authority of Pukou Campus was transferred to the Chengxian College of Southeast University. Most of the undergraduate students and master students are studying at Jiulonghu Campus currently. After Jiulonghu Campus was opened, the Sipailou Campus basically includes some most important research institutes and administrations of the university.
Jiulonghu Campus is situated in the south of the Jiangning Technology Development District, to the east of Suyuan Avenue, west of Shuanglong Street, and south of Jiyin Street. It is around 20 kilometers away from the Sipailou Campus, with an area of 3749mu. The architecture design of Jiulonghu Campus follows the basis of Southeast University&#x27;s culture, characterized in the combination of public teaching and research which compromises the merit of Chinese and Western styles, forming a green and active university community. The total building area in Jiulonghu Campus is 574 thousand square meters with the investment of 1.6 billion yuan.
