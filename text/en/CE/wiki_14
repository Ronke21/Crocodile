<text>The British Supermarine Spitfire was facing several challenges by mid-1942. The debut of the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190 in late 1941 had caused problems for RAF fighter squadrons flying the latest Spitfire Mk Vb. Rolls-Royce engineers were already working on a new version of the Merlin incorporating a two-stage supercharger; the combination of the improved Merlin and the Spitfire Mk Vc airframe in a &quot;stop-gap&quot; design allowed the RAF to combat the Fw 190 on equal terms.

In a second stream of development Supermarine was working on an improved, reinforced, Spitfire airframe which incorporated several new features and was designed for the Merlin 60 and 70 series engines. This new airframe later formed the basis for the Rolls-Royce Griffon powered Spitfires. This article presents a history of the Spitfire powered by two-stage engine variants and also describes some of the &quot;drawing board&quot; projects and experimental Spitfires. The Griffon powered variants are described in a separate article.

==Wing types==
The majority of the Spitfires from the Mk VIII on, used three basic wing types; C, D and E

===C type===
Also known as the &quot;universal wing&quot; the new design was standard on the majority of Spitfires built from mid 1942. The design of the wing was altered to reduce labour and manufacturing time and carry various armaments: A type, B type, or four 20 mm Hispano cannon.

The undercarriage mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage doors were bowed in cross-section allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing gear pivot points. Stronger undercarriage legs were raked 2 inches (5.08 cm) forward, making the Spitfire more stable on the ground and reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. During production of the Mk VIII and Mk IX a new undercarriage leg was introduced which had external v-shaped &quot;scissor-links&quot; fitted to the front of the leg; this also led to small changes in the shape of the undercarriage bay and leg fairings. Because the Spitfire was no longer to be used as a night fighter, the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted.

The Hispano Mk IIs were belt fed from box magazines allowing for 120 rpg (the system). The fairings over the Hispano barrels were shorter and there was usually a short rubber stub covering the outer cannon port. New upper wing gun-bay doors incorporated &quot;teardrop&quot; shaped blisters to clear the cannon feed motors and the lower wings no longer had the gun-bay heating vents outboard of the gun-bays. The first series of Spitfire Mk IXs retained the bay doors first used on Spitfire VCs; these incorporated large blisters to clear the feed motors of two Hispano cannons. All later Spitfires had smaller, more streamlined blisters. To provide room for the belt feed system of the cannon, the inner machine gun bays were moved outboard to between ribs 13 and 14.

Several versions of the Spitfire, starting with the HF Mk VIIs had extra 13 gallon integral fuel tanks added to the wing leading edges between the wing-root and the inboard cannon bay. Although many earlier Spitfires had been modified to carry bomb racks capable of carrying bombs the first Spitfires to be specifically modified for the fighter-bomber role (known as Modification 1209) were those of the Second Tactical Air Force. The first Mk IX Spitfires started being used in the role in June 1944.

===D Type===
These were made for photo-reconnaissance Spitfires, including the PR Mk X and XI; no armament was fitted and the D-shaped leading edges of the wings, ahead of the main spar, were converted into integral fuel tanks, each carrying 66 gallons. To avoid the expansion of fuel in hot weather damaging the wing, pressure relief valves, with small external vent pipes, were fitted near the wing tips.

===E type===
Structurally identical to the C wing. The outer machine gun ports were eliminated; although the outer machine-gun bays were retained, their access doors were devoid of empty cartridge case ports and cartridge deflectors. The new wing allowed for a four cannon armament and the inner bays could carry heavy machine guns. There were thus two possible weapon fits:
either
:*2 × .50 cal Browning M2 machine guns with 250 rpg in the inner bays and 2 × 20 mm Hispano Mk II cannon with 120 rpg in the outer bays
or
:*4 × 20 mm Hispano cannon with 120 rpg

The .303 machine guns mounted in the outer wings were no longer fitted, because rifle calibre bullets were ineffective against heavily armoured aircraft. (These outer guns had always been the less effective part of a Spitfire&#x27;s armament: their distance from the centreline made them hard to harmonise and in turning engagements, wing flexing meant that the rounds were even more widely scattered). The 20 mm Hispano cannon were moved outboard and the .50 calibre Browning M2/AN, with 250 rpg were added to the inner gun-bays. The first trial installation (modification 1029) was made in &quot;BS118&quot; in November 1943; by mid-March 1944 the first service Spitfires to be modified were from 485 (NZ), 222 and 349 Squadrons. Spitfires with this armament were at first referred to as &quot;Spifire LF.IX .5&quot; and the E suffix was not officially introduced until early 1945. This armament was standard for all Spitfire Mk IXs and XVIs used by the 2nd Tactical Air Force as fighters and fighter-bombers from shortly after D-Day. It proved more effective for both air-to-air engagements and air-to-ground attacks.

Many Spitfires had their elliptically &quot;pointed&quot; wing tips replaced by shorter, squared off fairings. This slightly improved maximum speed at low altitude and enhanced the roll rate. While many &quot;LF&quot; Spitfires (&quot;e.g.&quot; the LF.IX) had the &quot;clipped&quot; wings, a number did not. The true distinguishing feature of &quot;LF&quot; versions was the fitting of low-altitude versions of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine.

==Variants==

===Mark numbers, type numbers===
The Mark numbers did not necessarily indicate a &quot;chronological&quot; order, the Mk IX was a stopgap brought into production &quot;before&quot; the Mks VII and VIII. Some Spitfires of one mark or variant may have been modified to another; several of the first Mk Vbs were converted from Mk Ibs; the first Mk IXs were Mk Vcs converted, in some instances, by Rolls-Royce at their Hucknall facility.

Up until the end of 1942, the RAF names had Roman numerals for mark numbers. In the period 1943–1948 new aircraft entering service were given Arabic numerals for mark numbers but older aircraft retained Roman numerals. From 1948, Arabic numerals were used exclusively. This article adopts the convention of using Roman numerals for the Mks I–XVI and Arabic numerals for the Mks 17–24. &quot;Type numbers&quot; e.g.; (type 361) are the drawing board design numbers allocated by Supermarine.

===Features of late Merlin powered Spitfires===
With the development of the Merlin 61/63/66 and 70 series engines, with a two-stage, two-speed supercharger requiring an intercooler, several important modifications were made to the basic airframe and applied to all aircraft powered by these engines. The longer Merlin 61 meant the nose forward of the engine/fuel tank bulkhead was 7 inches (17.8 cm) longer. An intercooler was mounted behind the engine, on the supercharger casing. A small rectangular air scoop for a &quot;Heywood&quot; air compressor was fitted on the starboard upper engine cowling.

The carburettor air intake on early to mid-production Spitfire IXs was a different shape from those of single-stage engined aircraft; they were shorter and had a wider air inlet. From 1943, an &quot;Aero-Vee&quot; tropical filter in a long, streamlined fairing was introduced for the carburettor air intake. This was fitted as standard to all Mk VIIs, VIIIs, PR Mk Xs and Mk XVIs, on mid to late production Mk IXs, and to most PR Mk XIs.

A new 10 ft 9 in (3.27 m) diameter four-bladed Rotol propeller was fitted, housed in a pointed spinner. The exhaust units were changed to six &quot;fishtail&quot; stacks per side. Under the nose, the three piece cowling was changed to a one piece layout. The oil tank was no longer a part of the cowling structure. Early Mk IXs had a teardrop shaped blister (a bulge) for a Coffman engine starteron the lower starboard side cowling, just behind the propeller. This was replaced by an improved electric starter on most two-stage Merlin powered Spitfires and, from late 1942 the blister like bulge was seen on only a few aircraft.

The Type C wing was fitted as standard. Some mid and most late production Spifire Mk IXs and all Mk XVI were fitted with the Type E wing. While Spitfire IXs converted from Mk Vcs had the large teardrop fairings on the upper surfaces, on the majority of Mk VIIs, VIIIs, IXs and XVIs the teardrop shaped blisters covering the Hispano feed motors were reduced in size and more streamlined than those on the Mk Vc. According to A.P 1565J P &amp; L (Spitfire IX, XI and XVI Pilot&#x27;s Notes) the red painted undercarriage indicator rods, which projected through the tops of the wings when the undercarriage was down, were used only on early production Mk IXs. When fitted these rods supplemented an &quot;Electric visual indicator&quot; mounted on the instrument panel. The indicator rods seemed to be fitted on all Mk VIIs and VIIIs, supplementing the electric visual indicator. A light for the retractable tailwheel was mounted on the instrument panel, just below the main visual indicator.

Because the intercooler required a radiator, the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one radiator section provided enough coolant; a thermostatic switch turned off the starboard radiator section until more power was called for and extra engine cooling was required.

Other structural changes included flush riveting for the fuselage, introduced in mid-1943. A streamlined round rear-view mirror, with a bullet-shaped fairing replaced the rectangular version. On new production Mk IXs the small, teardrop shaped identification light behind the radio mast was removed.

While early Mk IXs converted from Mk Vcs had the original (smaller) elevator horn mass-balances, most had the enlarged version with the straightened leading edge. A new rudder of greater area, which could be identified by a &quot;pointed&quot; tip, was fitted to many Mk VIIs, Mk VIIIs, and mid to late production Mk IXs and Mk XVIs.

All Mk VII and Mk VIII Spitfires had the following changes:
The internal structure was strengthened and revised. On the wings the ailerons were reduced in span by outboard of the outer hinges. There had been some instances of earlier models breaking up in the air in steep high speed dives, it was thought, because of aileron flutter.

The main fuselage fuel tanks were increased in capacity; 47 gal (213.7 L) for the upper tank and 49 gal (222.7 L) for the lower. In combination with the wing tanks this gave a total internal capacity of 122 gal (554.6 L), a near 50% increase over the 85 gal (386.4 L) carried by earlier Spitfire marks. In addition a 13 gal (64 L) fuel tank was fitted in each wing leading edge between the wingroot and the inner gun-bay.

The main undercarriage legs, for the first time in the Spitfire&#x27;s life, were fitted with forward-facing torque links. In addition, the leg doors were slightly concave, allowing the undercarriage to sit lower in the wheel wells when retracted: this meant the upper wing skinning was free of the small bulge which had hitherto been necessary to clear the wheels. The wheels themselves were a new strengthened Dunlop AH10019 &quot;four spoke&quot; pattern, replacing the &quot;five spoke&quot; pattern used since the first Mk Is. This revised undercarriage was also fitted on some mid to late Mk IXs and all Mk XVIs. A retractable tailwheel (Dunlop 2184) was fitted, covered by small doors when in flight. This also applied to the PR Mk Xs and most PR Mk XIs.

===Mk VII (type 351)===

Like the Mk VI, the Mk VII was a high altitude pressurised variant, this time powered by the Merlin 64 (F. Mk. VII) or 71 (H.F. Mk. VII) series engine with two-stage, two-speed superchargers. The cockpit was pressurised in a similar way to that of the Mk VI, although the details were slightly different. Other changes to the airframe are noted above. The Mk VII used a Marshall manufactured compressor for pressurising the cockpit; this was mounted on the right of the engine and drew its air through a long intake under the starboard exhaust stubs. An automatic valve allowed a maximum pressure differential of +2 lb./sq.in. This was built up during the climb and was maintained at heights of 28,000 ft and above.

Extended, &quot;pointed&quot; wingtips were fitted to the Type C wings, increasing the wingspan to 40 ft 2 in (12.2 m). Because the threat from high altitude bombers never materialised many Mk VIIs later reverted to the normal, rounded wingtip.

While early Mk VIIs were fitted with a detachable canopy, secured by four pilot-operated catches, later Mk VIIs were fitted with a &quot;Lobelle&quot;-type hood which opened by sliding backwards, as on non-pressurised versions of the Spitfire. This was a big improvement on the clampdown cockpit of the Mk VI. The canopy was double-glazed and used rubber tubing to create a proper pressure seal against the fuselage. The canopy rails were bulkier than the standard Spitfire type.
In total, 140 Mk VIIs were built by Supermarine. Most of them were powered by the Merlin 64 (F. Mk. VII) or Merlin 71 (H.F Mk. VII), the latter fitted with a Bendix-Stromberg &quot;anti-g&quot; carburettor. The HF Mk had superb high-altitude performance, with a service ceiling of ; French ace Pierre Clostermann recalls in his book, &quot;The Big Show&quot;, the successful interception of a long-range reconnaissance Messerschmitt Bf 109G-6/R3 by a Mk VII &quot; &#x27;Strato Spitfire&#x27; &quot; of 602 Squadron at over the British Home Fleet&#x27;s base at Scapa Flow in early 1944.

===Mk VIII (type 360)===
The Mk VIII was an adaptation of the Mk VII without the pressurised cabin and was intended to become the main production model of the Spitfire. When the &quot;interim&quot; Mk IX proved to be adequate against the German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 it was decided to use the shadow factory at Castle Bromwich to produce that version only; the Mk VIII Spitfires were all built by Supermarine. Apart from the lack of pressurisation, the Mk VIII differed little from the Mk VII beyond the reshaped fin and pointed rudder.

Some early production models had extended wingtips but the majority were fitted with the standard version. According to Supermarine&#x27;s Chief Test pilot Jeffrey Quill &quot;When I am asked which mark of Spitfire I consider the best from the flying point of view, I usually reply &#x27;The Mark VIII with standard wingtips.&#x27; I &quot;hated&quot; the extended wingtips...They were of no practical value to the Mark VIII and simply reduced the aileron response and the rate of roll.&quot; New Zealand ace Alan Peart described the extended wingtips causing structural damage to Mk VII Spitfires in Burma, and being replaced by standard wingtips. There were three sub-variants for low altitude (LF Mk VIII), medium altitude (F Mk VIII) and high altitude (HF Mk VIII) which were powered respectively by the Merlin 66, Merlin 63 and Merlin 70 engines.
The F Mk VIII&#x27;s top speed was at 25,000 ft (404 mph for the LF Mk VIII at and for the HF Mk VIII at 26,500 ft), with a service ceiling of 43,000 ft (41,500 ft for the LF Mk VIII and for the HF Mk VIII). The two main tanks were given an extra 11 gal for a total of 96 gal which, along with the wing tanks, allowed the fighter to fly for a maximum distance of with a full internal fuel load and with a full internal load and a 90 gal drop tank. Provision was made to allow the Mk VIII to carry a single &quot;slipper&quot; drop tank of 30, 90 or 170 gal capacity. With a 170 gal tank, the aeroplane could fly over . When carrying the 90 or 175 gal tank the aircraft was restricted, once airborne and at cruising altitude, to straight and level flight. A maximum external bomb load of 1,000 pounds (1 × bomb attached to the centre bomb-rack plus a bomb under each wing) could be carried.

A Mk VIII &quot;JF299&quot; was used to experiment with the use of a new cut-back rear fuselage and a &quot;tear-drop&quot; canopy. This was intended to aid pilot visibility; many Spitfire pilots who were shot down were done so by enemies who approached in the aircraft&#x27;s blind spot. In trials, the new hood design was found to bring about great improvements to all-round visibility and with several modifications, was standardised on later Spitfires.

This variant served almost exclusively overseas in the Mediterranean, with the Desert Air Force and the USAAF, in the South West Pacific Area, with the Royal Australian Air Force and RAF and in the South-East Asian theatre with the RAF. After the Mk IX and Mk V, the Mk VIII was the third most numerous operational variant with 1,658 examples built.

===Mk IX (type 361)===
In the early months of 1942, with the clear superiority of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 over the Spitfire Mk Vb, there was much pressure to get Spitfires into production using the new two-stage supercharged Merlin 61 engine. In September 1941 the Spitfire Mk III prototype &quot;N3297&quot; had been converted by Rolls-Royce at their Hucknall plant to take a Merlin 60, which had been specifically designed for use in the Wellington Mk VI high altitude bomber.

The performance increase was described by Jeffrey Quill as a &quot;quantum leap&quot; over that of the Mk Vb and another Spitfire airframe, &quot;R6700&quot; was modified to take the new engine. Although design work on the Mk VII and VIII series was under way, these would take over a year to get into production and a counter to the Fw 190 was urgently needed. The Air Ministry made the decision that Mk Vc airframes should be converted to take the more powerful engine and, as a result, many of the early Mk IXs were converted Mk Vcs which did not have any of the refinements which later appeared. These could be identified by the Type C wing with the large double blisters over the inner cannon bays and the identification light on the fuselage spine, behind the aerial mast. The elevator horns were also smaller in size than that of most Mk IXs which had larger horn balances. The first Mk IX was a modified Mk Vc &quot;AB505&quot;, which was tested by the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU) in April 1942. The report said;The performance of the Spitfire IX is outstandingly better than the Spitfire V especially at heights above 20,000 feet. On the level the Spitfire is considerably faster and climb is exceptionally good. It will climb easily to 38,000 feet and when levelled off there can be made to climb in stages to above 40,000 feet by building up speed on the level and a slight zoom. Its manoeuvrability is as good as a Spitfire V up to 30,000 feet and above is very much better. At 38,000 feet it is capable of a true speed of 368mph and is still able to manoeuvre well for fighting. Although the Mk IX&#x27;s airframe did not have the aerodynamic and strength improvements, or the modified control surfaces of the Mk VII and VIII, the Mk IX still proved to be an effective counter to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190.
In September 1942, the &quot;High Altitude Flight&quot; was set up at RAF Northolt to counter the threat of the high altitude Junkers Ju 86 R bombers. Two Spitfire Mk IXs converted from Vcs were stripped of armour, the .303 Brownings and other equipment and repainted in a lightweight PRU blue finish. One of them intercepted a Ju 86R at over.

Production of the Mk IX finished at Supermarine in June 1943, with production continuing exclusively at the Castle Bromwich factory. Several major and large numbers of minor improvements were progressively introduced to Mk IXs, some of which were used on other Spitfire variants.

The Merlin 61 was phased out early in 1943 in favour of the Merlin 63 and 63A. The new engine had increased power resulting from engine improvements and engine limitations of +18 lbf/(sq in) and 3,000 rpm (5 minute combat). During the second half of 1943, production of the Merlin 63 powered F Mk IX was discontinued in favour of the Merlin 66 powered LF Mk IX. Early production Spitfire Mk IXs suffered from vapour locks in the fuel lines resulting from fuel evaporating if the aircraft was parked in direct sunlight. As a result of this the gun-camera was moved from the port wingroot to the starboard wingroot and a fuel cooler, fed by a small round air-intake was fitted in its place. This fuel cooler was also fitted to early PR Mk XIs.

Production of the LF Mk IXs, frequently referred to as the Spitfire Mk IXb, initially ran in parallel with the Merlin 63 powered Marks. This version first became operational in March 1943 with the Biggin Hill Wing, comprised at the time of 611 and 341 (Free French) Squadrons. This type was by far the most produced of the Spitfire Mk IX variants, with over 4,000 built. The maximum power of the Merlin 66 was at 5,750 ft (1,283 kW at 1,752 m) and the maximum speed of the Spitfire LF Mk IX was at . The Merlin 66 introduced a new Bendix-Stromberg injection carburettor, which replaced the earlier S.U float carburettor.

The HF Mk IX was powered by the specialised high altitude Merlin 70 and entered service in the spring of 1944. Serial listings show that the HF Mk IX was produced in relatively limited numbers when they were required, with priority being given to versions rated for low and medium altitudes Maximum power of the Merlin 70 was at 11,000 ft (1,275 kW at 3,353 m): maximum speed of the Spitfire HF Mk IX was at
 at an all-up weight of 7,320 lb (3,320 kg).
Also introduced in early 1944 was a new Mark II Gyro gunsight. This gunsight calculated the correct angle of deflection to use when leading the target. Its introduction doubled the effectiveness of RAF gunnery and was a major factor in Allied air superiority.

The capacity of the main fuel tanks was 48 gal for the upper tank and 37 gal for the lower, for a total internal capacity of 85 gal. Jettisonable &quot;slipper tanks&quot; of 30, 45 or 90 gal could be carried under the centre-section. As an alternative a cylindrical 50 gal drop tank, adapted from those carried by long range Hawker Typhoons, could be carried on the fuselage bomb rack used on most Mk IXs of the Second Tactical Air Force. To further increase the combat radius some late production Mk IXs were fitted with additional internal self-sealing fuel tanks in the rear fuselage: the upper tank carried 41 gal and the lower 34 gal. When both were full this enabled a ferry range of over , although they made the aircraft unstable in flight and only straight flight and gentle manoeuvres at low altitudes were recommended by the pilot&#x27;s manual. The pilot was also warned to avoid instrument flying whenever possible.

Late production Mk IXs, in common with Mk XVIs introduced a new upper engine cowling which incorporated a distinct bulged top surface; this design was adopted for the Mk XVI to allow for the modified intercooler of the Packard Merlin 266, which had an integral header tank.

The cut-down rear fuselage and bubble canopy, trialled on a Spitfire Mk VIII, was incorporated into very late production Mk IXs. With the cut down fuselage the lower forward fuselage tank capacity was increased to 47 gallons, while the rear fuel tanks were decreased to a capacity of 66 gallons. These were the rarest of the Mk IXs and many of them featured the &quot;clipped&quot; wings. The great majority of these saw postwar service with the SAAF, both in South Africa and in deployment in Korea during the 1950s.

During early 1945, some Spitfire IXes and XVIes of 74 Squadron were fitted with a single RP-3 rocket under each wing. This was believed to be the only RAF Spitfire unit to use rockets operationally during the Second World War.

===PR Mk IX (type 374) and FR Mk IX===
Pending development of a dedicated Merlin 61 powered PR Spitfire (the Mk XI) at least three Mk IXs (&quot;BS338&quot;, &quot;BS339&quot; and &quot;BS473&quot;) were taken off the production line and modified to carry two vertical cameras in the rear fuselage. The first of these was delivered to 541 Squadron at RAF Benson on 30 November 1942. Subsequently, another 15 Mk IXs were converted to PR Mk IXs (factory designation type 374) at the Vickers-Armstrong Worthy Down facility. As well as incorporating camera equipment, a wrap-around PR type windscreen was fitted and a larger oil tank was installed under the nose. All armament was removed and a PRU Blue finish applied. These aircraft lacked the &quot;wet wing&quot; tanks, meaning that the PR Mk IX relied on drop tanks for extra range. The most famous PR Mk IX missions involved carrying out reconnaissance missions in preparation for Operation Chastise, the 617 &quot;Dambusters&quot; Squadron attacks on the Ruhr dams. A PR Mk IX photographed the dams the day before the operation and photographed the Moehne Dam after the operation.

FR IXs were standard, armed Mk IXs modified with a single, port-facing, oblique camera. These aircraft were used for low altitude &quot;Dicing&quot; missions in tactical support of army operations. 16 Squadron, which was a unit of the 2nd TAF, used several FR Mk IXs (painted a pale, &quot;Camoutint&quot; Pink, which provided excellent camouflage under cloud cover) to photograph the Arnhem area before and during Operation Market Garden. Another unit using FR Mk IXs was 318 (Polish) &quot;City of Gdańsk&quot; Fighter-Reconnaissance Squadron based in the Mediterranean. Some Spitfires in the MJ- and MK- serial ranges, sent for repair to the Forward Repair Unit (FRU), were also converted by the FRU to a different style of FR Mk IXc with streamlined blisters on both sides of the fuselage. These were used exclusively by No. 414 Squadron RCAF to replace its TAC-R Mustangs. The same conversion was used on F Mk XIVe Spitfires to make FR Mk XIVe Spitfires used exclusively by No. 430 Squadron RCAF.

===T Mk IX and TR 9 (type 509)===

Although there were wartime conversions of the Spitfire into a two-seat trainer including the one-off modification of a Mk Vc by RAF no. 261 Squadron and a Mk IX converted for use as a trainer by the Soviets, the two-seat Spitfire trainer was primarily a postwar programme. In 1946, a Mk VIII (&quot;MT818&quot;) was the first Vickers-built trainer built as a demonstrator, but in 1948, 10 Spitfire T Mk IXs, were exported to India. In 1951, a further six TR 9 trainers were converted from the standard Mk IX to train pilots for the Irish Air Corps (IAC) Seafire fleet. The Spitfires provided transition training that included gunnery practice since the type was equipped with two .303 Browning machine guns, one in each outer wing bay. Most of the TR 9 aircraft passed to the ground technical training school at Baldonnel where they were used as instructional airframes for the training of aircraft engineers for the Air Corps. Four of the IAC aircraft survived and two went on to join the warbird fleet in the 1970s and later.

In total, 5,656 Mk IXs were built, 561 by Supermarine and 5,095 by Castle Bromwich. Production of the Mk IX ended in April 1945 and, in combination with the Mk XVI this &quot;compromise&quot; was produced in larger numbers than any other Spitfire variant.

===PR Mk X and PR Mk XI (types 387, 365 and 370)===

When development started on new Merlin 60 powered Spitfires, both the Mk VII and VIII were to have photo-reconnaissance (PR) variants. On 21 April 1942, an order was placed for 70 aircraft, provisionally designated PR Mk VIII. Based on the revised MK VIII airframe these aircraft were to be powered by Merlin 61s and were assigned serial numbers &quot;LV643–681&quot; and &quot;LV726-756&quot;. The Spitfires bearing these serials were eventually built as Merlin 66 LF Mk VIIIs.

A policy change resulted in the pressurised PR variant of the Mk VII being renamed PR Mk X (type 387). This version followed the PR Mk XI into production and was based on the Mk VII airframe with PR Mk XI wings and camera installation. It had the pressurised Mk VII cockpit, with the Lobelle sliding canopy, and retained the fighter style windscreen with the bullet-proof glass panel. The long thin air intake to the cockpit pressurisation system was fitted under the exhaust stacks on the starboard cowling. The performance was similar to that of the PR XI although the pressurised cockpit meant that this version could stay at altitudes of over 40,000 ft for longer without the exhausting physiological effects experienced by the pilots of unpressurised cockpits. Sixteen Mk Xs were built during April and May 1944, with the first mission being flown on 11 May. All saw limited service in 541 Squadron and 542 Squadron for high altitude reconnaissance. Experience with this version led to the development and production of the pressurised version of the PR Mk XIX.

The Mk XI (type 365 standard, type 370 tropicalised) was based on a combination of features from the marks VII, VIII and IX. The Mk XI was the first PR variant to have the option of using two vertically mounted F52 cameras with 36-inch-focal-length lens in the fuselage behind the cockpit. Several other configurations could be fitted, depending on the mission; the X Type installation, for example had two vertically mounted F24s with 14-inch lens and an oblique F24 with an 8-inch lens mounted above and facing to port. PR Mk XIs used for tactical reconnaissance had an additional, vertically oriented camera in a fairing under each wing.

Physically the Mk XIs had a deeper nose fairing to accommodate a larger 14.5 gal oil tank and used the unarmoured, wrap-around PRU windscreen. Booster pumps for the wing tanks were fitted and covered by teardrop shaped fairings under the wings. Retractable tailwheels were fitted as standard and the majority of the Mk XIs built had the later large-area pointed rudder. 260 Mk XIs were powered by Merlin 61, 63 or 63A engines, while the remaining 211 used the high-altitude Merlin 70. All of the Merlin 70 and 198 of the Merlin 60 series aircraft were fitted with the Vokes Aero-Vee dust filter in the extended, streamlined carburettor air intake under the nose. All Merlin 60 powered aircraft featured the fuel cooler in the port leading edge wing root. The radio installation was either the VHF TR.1133 or TR.1143 fitted with the &quot;Rebecca&quot; beam approach equipment.

Additional slipper drop tanks could be fitted under the centre-section; in common with the Mk IX these could be 30, 45 or 90 gal capacity and, for the Mk XI, a tank of 170 gal capacity was also available.

Spitfire PR Mk XIs were capable of a top speed of at and could cruise at at . Normally Spitfire XIs cruised between these altitudes although, in an emergency, the aircraft could climb to However, pilots could not withstand such altitudes for long in a non-pressurised cockpit without suffering from serious physiological effects.

At first, production of the PR Mk XI was delayed because development of the Mk VII and VIII series was delayed. As a result, it was decided to base the Merlin 60 powered PR aircraft on the MK IX airframe. Production was further threatened because of a dispute over RAF PR doctrine: in early 1943, because the new PR Spitfire was delayed, the Air Ministry proposed that all PR units be converted to de Havilland Mosquitoes. After further analysis the Air Staff agreed that Mosquitoes could perform 90% of PR missions so the Spitfire production for only 10% of PR units was mooted. Air Vice Marshal John Slessor, head of Coastal Command pointed out that the Spitfire was smaller than the Mosquito, used half the number of Merlin engines and was faster, more manoeuvrable and quieter and, therefore production should be increased, not reduced. As a result, the Air Staff decided that PR Mk XI production should be accelerated at the cost of the fighters.

The first Mk XIs were built in November 1942: from April 1944 production ran concurrently with the PR Mk XIX before ending in December 1944, when they were phased out in favour of the Mk XIX. In total 471 Mk XI were built by Supermarine.

===PR Mk XIII===
The PR Mk XIII was an improved PR Type G with a single-stage Merlin engine and is described in Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)

===Mk XVI (type 361)===

The Mk XVI was the same as the Mk IX in nearly all respects except for the engine, a Merlin 266. The Merlin 266 was the Merlin 66 and was built under licence in the USA by the Packard Motor Company. The &quot;2&quot; was added as a prefix in order to avoid confusion with the engines, as they required different tooling. All Mk XVI aircraft produced were of the Low-Altitude Fighter (LF) variety. This was not determined by the length of the wings (clipped wings were fitted to most LF Spitfires), but by the engine, which had been optimised for low-altitude operation. Almost all production Mk XVIs had clipped wings for low altitude work and were fitted with the rear fuselage fuel tanks with a combined capacity of 75 gal. Many XVIs featured cut-down rear fuselages with bubble canopies. On these aircraft the rear fuselage tank capacity was limited to 66 gal.

Because of a slightly taller intercooler and rearranged accessories on the Packard Merlins a new, bulged upper cowling was introduced and also appeared on late production IXs.

Armament for most Mk XVIs consisted of 2 × 20 mm Hispano II cannon – each with 120 rpg – and 2 × .50 calibre Browning machine guns – each with 250 rpg. 1 × 500 lb (227 kg) bomb could be carried underneath the centre rack, and 1 × 250 lb (114 kg) bomb could be slung under each wing. Some production aircraft had rear fuselage fuel tanks in addition to the main tank which allowed it to fly approximately as far as the Spitfire Mk VIII. Problems with the licence-built engines limited introduction to front-line squadrons for several months. A total of 1,054 Mk XVIs were built by Castle Bromwich.

===Spitfire Floatplanes (types 355 and 359)===

With the German invasion of Norway in April 1940 the RAF took an interest in the concept of using floatplane fighters in areas where airfields were not immediately available. To this end a Spitfire Mk I &quot;R6722&quot; was taken in hand at the Woolston factory to be modified and mounted on Blackburn Roc floats. Tank tests were carried out at Farnborough, using a 1/7 scale model, it was found that the concept was basically sound, although the vertical tail surfaces would need to be enlarged to counterbalance the side area of the floats. The end of the Battle of Norway and the need for as many Spitfires as possible meant that &quot;R6772&quot; was converted back to an ordinary fighter without being flown. With the entry of Japan into the war the concept was revived in early 1942. A Spitfire V &quot;W3760&quot; was fitted with a pair of floats 25 ft 7 in (7.8 m) long, mounted on cantilever legs. This aircraft was powered by a Merlin 45 driving a four-bladed propeller of diameter (3.4 m). A Vokes filter was fitted to the carburettor air intake and under the tail an extra fin extension was added.

Other changes included external lifting points forward of and behind the cockpit and a spin-recovery parachute with a rudder balance-horn guard. The Spitfire floatplane was first flown on 12 October 1942 by Jeffrey Quill. Soon afterwards the Vokes filter was replaced by an Aero-Vee filter, similar to that on later Merlin 61 series aircraft, which was extended to prevent water entry, and full Mk Vb armament was installed. Two more Vbs &quot;EP751&quot; and &quot;EP754&quot; were converted by Folland and all three floatplanes were transported to Egypt, arriving in October 1943. At the time it was thought that the floatplanes could operate from concealed bases in the Dodecanese Islands, disrupting supply lines to German outposts in the area which relied on resupply by transport aircraft. This scheme came to naught when a large number of German troops, backed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, took over the British held islands of Kos and Leros. No other role could be found for the floatplane Spitfires, which languished in Egypt, operating from the Great Bitter Lake. Specifications for the Vb based floatplane included a maximum speed of at 19,500 ft (521 km/h at 5,943 m), a maximum rate of climb of 2,450 ft/min at 15,500 ft (12.45 m/s at 4,724 m) and an estimated service ceiling of 33,400 ft (10,180 m).

In the spring of 1944, with the prospect of use in the Pacific Theatre, a Spitfire IX &quot;MJ892&quot; was converted to a floatplane. This used the same components as the earlier Mk Vb conversions. Jeffrey Quill wrote:
The Spitfire IX on floats was faster than the standard Hurricane. Its handling on the water was extremely good and its only unusual feature was a tendency to &quot;tramp&quot; from side to side on the floats, or to &quot;waddle&quot; a bit when at high speed in the plane.
Soon after testing started the idea of using floatplane fighters was dropped and &quot;MJ982&quot; was converted back to a landplane.

Five aircraft were converted:
* Mk I – &quot;R6722&quot;
* F Mk Vb – &quot;W3760&quot;
* Mk V – &quot;EP751&quot; and &quot;EP754&quot;
* Mk IXb – &quot;MJ892&quot; 

===Related design projects===
Supermarine 305: Designed to the same F.9/35 specification which led to the Boulton Paul Defiant turret fighter (and the rejected Hawker Hotspur). The basic F.37/34 (as Spitfire was still then known) wing and undercarriage were mated to a modified fuselage which provided room for a gunner and a remote control four-gun turret (originally armed with .303 Brownings, later with Lewis light machine guns.) Other modifications included a cooling system mounted in a chin radiator housing. There was no forward firing armament and dive brakes were added to the wings. Projected speed 315 mph (507 km/h) at 15,000 ft (4,572 m).

Supermarine 312: To F.37/35 for a cannon armed fighter. This was the basic Spitfire Mk I adapted to take four 20 mm Oerlikon cannon mounted in modified wings. The radiator and oil cooler were moved from under the wing to a duct under the fuselage. This was R J Mitchell&#x27;s last design before his death in 1937. A separate twin engined design to the same specification was also offered. The Ministry rejected the 312 as Supermarine&#x27;s design office was already too fully engaged on the Spitfire design to work on the alternative wing. The twin-engined Westland Whirlwind was accepted for the specification.

Supermarine 324, 325 and 327: These designs were for twin-engined fighters to F.18/37 (which was for the successor to the Spitfire and Hurricane) which used the same construction techniques and elliptical wing as the Spitfire. All three used tricycle undercarriage with the primary engine being a Merlin with an alternative being the Bristol Taurus. The 324 and 325 were intended to carry an armament of 12 .303 calibre Brownings in groups of six in each outer wing, while the 327 had the armament changed to six 20 mm Hispanos mounted in the wing roots. The 324 and 327 had conventional tractor engines, while the 325 had a pusher engine. Two designs from Hawker which led to the Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tornado were selected. The Type 327 was considered for a while as it offered cannon armament but the Whirlwind, the Bristol Beaufighter and Gloster F.9/37 were already in development.

==Griffon engine variants==

The early Spitfire variants powered by the Rolls-Royce Griffon were adaptations of Mk Vc (early Mk XII) or Mark VIII (late Mk XII and Mk XIV) airframes. The later Griffon-engined Spitfire variants embodied new wings, tail units and undercarriages and were very different from any of the earlier Spitfire marks. Griffon-engined variants are described in a separate article.

==Production==
After the destruction of the main Itchen and Woolston works by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in September 1940, all Supermarine manufactured Spitfires were built in a number of &quot;Shadow Factories&quot;; by the end of the war there were ten main factories and several smaller workshops which built many of the components. A more detailed explanation can be found in Supermarine Spitfire. The main Castle Bromwich factory was also aided by a smaller number of the shadow factories.
As the first of the Mk IXs were converted from Mk Vcs the first true production Mk IX is listed by serial Number.

<text>Alvin Hawkins (December 2, 1821 – April 27, 1905) was an American jurist and politician. He served as the 22nd Governor of Tennessee from 1881 to 1883, one of just three Republicans to hold this position from the end of Reconstruction to the latter half of the 20th century. Hawkins was also a judge on the Tennessee Supreme Court in the late 1860s, and was briefly the U.S. consul to Havana, Cuba, in 1868.

==Early life==
Hawkins was born in Bath County, Kentucky, the eldest of thirteen children of John Hawkins and Mary (Ralston) Hawkins. He was of English descent. When he was four, his parents moved to Maury County, Tennessee, and two years later moved to Carroll County. Hawkins attended McLemoresville Academy and Bethel College, and was taught farming and blacksmithing by his father. He eventually turned to law, however, which he studied while earning money teaching school. He read law under Judge Benjamin Totten, and was admitted to the bar in 1843. He briefly practiced with his cousin, Isaac R. Hawkins, before establishing his own practice in Huntingdon.

==Early political career==
A Whig, Hawkins first ran for a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1845, but was unsuccessful. He ran again in 1853, and this time, he was successful, but he served only one term and did not seek reelection. He campaigned against secession in the late 1850s, and supported Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell, who opposed secession and took a neutral stance on the issue of slavery, in the presidential election of 1860. While many anti-secession Tennessee Whigs switched their support to the Confederacy after the Battle of Fort Sumter, Hawkins remained staunchly pro-Union for the duration of the Civil War.

In December 1862, after the Union Army had regained control of much of West Tennessee, the state&#x27;s military governor, Andrew Johnson, called for congressional elections to be held in its 9th and 10th congressional districts. Hawkins was elected to the 9th district seat, but the House of Representatives deemed his vote total (1,900) to be too low in proportion to his district&#x27;s population (18,000), and refused to seat him. He spent the next few months scouting West Tennessee to gather information for the state&#x27;s military authorities. In 1864, he was appointed United States Attorney for West Tennessee by President Abraham Lincoln.

In 1865, Hawkins was appointed to the newly reconstituted Tennessee Supreme Court by Governor William G. Brownlow. He served alongside J. O. Shackleford and Sam Milligan. Among the cases the court decided during his tenure was &quot;Ridley v. Sherbrook&quot;, in which the court upheld the Brownlow administration&#x27;s strict voting requirements. He resigned in 1868, and briefly served as U.S. Consul to Havana, Cuba. Later that year, the state legislature, responding to irritation over Brownlow&#x27;s court appointees, called for elections to choose new justices to the court. Hawkins was among the Republican nominees, and since most Democrats were still disfranchised, he was elected. His term ended, however, with the enactment of the new Tennessee State Constitution in 1870, and he returned to his law practice in Huntingdon.

==Governor==
Throughout the 1870s, Tennessee struggled to control the debt it had accumulated over the previous decades to pay for internal improvements and railroad construction. The Panic of 1873 brought a decrease in property tax revenues, and the state defaulted on its bond payments in 1875. Following this default, the Democratic Party split into two factions, one of which sought to protect the state&#x27;s credit at all costs and pay off the bonds in full, and the other rejecting this as unfeasible and suggesting just partial payment of the bond debt. Governor James D. Porter (1875–1879) was of the former faction, and Governor Albert S. Marks (1879–1881) was of the latter, but neither was able to solve the problem.

By 1880, the split over the debt issue had left the Democratic Party seriously divided, and Marks declined to run for reelection. At the party&#x27;s state convention in May of that year, John Wright, who represented the faction that sought full payment of the debt, known as the &quot;state credit&quot; or &quot;high tax&quot; faction, was nominated as the party&#x27;s candidate for governor. Members of the &quot;low tax&quot; faction, which sought only a partial payment of the debt and demanded any change in the debt policy be put before the voters in a referendum, walked out of the convention and nominated their own candidate, S.F. Wilson. Republicans nominated Hawkins, and the Greenback Party nominated Richard M. Edwards. In the general election, Hawkins won with 103,964 votes to 78,783 for Wright, 57,080 for Wilson, and 3,459 for Edwards.

Hawkins favored full repayment of the state debt. In May 1881, the state legislature, where the divided Democrats controlled the senate and Republicans controlled the house by one seat, passed a bill that called for all state bonds held by commercial interests to be replaced by new bonds of equal dollar value, but with a 3% interest rate, and called for the state property tax to be quadrupled. The bill passed the House and Senate, and was signed into law by Hawkins. The &quot;low tax&quot; Democrats challenged the law in court, however, and the act was declared unconstitutional by the Tennessee Supreme Court in February 1882. In May 1882, the legislature passed a plan calling for payment of commercial bonds at 60%, but this was never enacted.

During the gubernatorial campaign of 1882, state Democrats remained divided, but the &quot;low tax&quot; Democrats, with the help of former governor Isham G. Harris and the Bourbon faction, gained the upper hand. General William Brimage Bate, who favored full repayment on bonds for schools and charities, and partial repayment on commercial bonds, was nominated as the candidate. The &quot;high tax&quot; Democrats nominated Joseph Fussell, and the Greenbacks nominated John R. Beasley. On election day, Bate won with 120,637 votes to 93,168 for Hawkins, 9,660 for Beasley, and 4,814 for Fussell.

Although Hawkins failed to win reelection, he was praised by members of both parties for running an honest government, helping to erase the stigma attached to the Republican Party as a result of the Brownlow administration&#x27;s radical post-war policies. Hawkins also enacted several judicial and educational reforms. He appointed W.S. Doak, a descendant of legendary clergyman Samuel Doak, state superintendent of schools, and the state&#x27;s first professional institute was established during his tenure as governor.

==Later life==
Following his term as governor, Hawkins returned to his law practice in Huntingdon. He remained active in the Methodist Church, and stumped for unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial candidate Henry Clay Evans in 1894. He died at his home in Huntingdon on April 27, 1905.

==Family==
Hawkins was married on August 17, 1847, to Justina Ott. They had six children, four dying young. Hawkins was from a prominent family; his brother Ashton William Hawkins (1824–1888) was a clerk of the circuit court, a doctor, and a minister. Another brother, Albert G. Hawkins (1841–1908), was a judge, lawyer and served in the Tennessee state senate. Alvin&#x27;s mother, Mary (&quot;Polly&quot;) Graham Ralston, was a first cousin of California governor John Neely Johnson.

<text>Eastcote is a suburban area in the London Borough of Hillingdon, in west London.

In the Middle Ages, Eastcote was one of the three areas that made up the parish of Ruislip, under the name of Ascot. The name came from its position to the east of the parish.

Eastcote housed an outstation of the Bletchley Park codebreaking activities during the Second World War, with several codebreaking computers in use. This operation became the precursor to GCHQ, which remained in Eastcote after the war until the department moved to purpose-built buildings in Cheltenham in 1952.

Lady Mary Bankes lived in Eastcote for a time, and led the defence of Corfe Castle in Dorset against the Roundheads during the English Civil War.

By the turn of the 20th century, the recorded population was around 600; this had reached for the ward in 2007.

Part of Eastcote is in the Pinner postal district, despite being in Hillingdon rather than Harrow.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Eastcote was originally recorded as Ascot, one of the three medieval tithings of the parish of Ruislip, along with Westcot and Norwood. Norwood, in the north of the parish, became Northwood; Westcot, in the west became Westcote (the main Ruislip village), and Ascot, in the east, became what is now Eastcote.

===Early developments===

The Hawtrey family moved to Eastcote around 1525 after Ralph Hawtrey married Winifred Walleston. She lived in a cottage named &quot;Hopkyttes&quot;, which the couple moved into and renamed Eastcote House. A dovecote was built by their son John, without applying for a licence from the manor, as was the custom at the time. After his death in 1593, his nephew Ralph Hawtrey applied for the licence, which was approved.

Ralph Hawtrey&#x27;s only daughter became Lady Mary Bankes when she married Sir John Bankes, Chief Justice to Charles I. As a Royalist, she defended their home in Dorset, Corfe Castle, against the Roundheads in 1643 at the time of the English Civil War. A plaque on the south wall of St Martin&#x27;s Church in Ruislip commemorates her heroic act. Lady Bankes had also lived at Haydon Hall in Eastcote, and her name is remembered by the school in Northwood Hills.

In 1565, a land survey was completed which recorded 62 houses in Eastcote, of which four were ruined.

The first Haydon Hall was built in 1630 for Lady Alice, the Dowager Countess of Derby, predominantly to allow her to store her possessions there. Lady Alice lived at Harefield Place, and purchased the land on which the hall was built from the Haydon family. The family appear in parish records from 1394 until 1562 when they sold a house on the site of Haydon Hall to William Nicholas.

Highgrove House was built in the 18th century but was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1879. Winston Churchill stayed there during his honeymoon and the Queen of Sweden was resident during the First World War.

===Urban development===

At the turn of the 20th century, Eastcote was a small community with around 120 cottages and a population of around 600 people.

The Metropolitan Railway was extended to Uxbridge from Harrow on the Hill in 1904, passing through Eastcote. A halt was built in 1906. The extension of the railway brought with it a substantial number of travellers seeking a day out in the countryside. The tea garden of the Old Barn House became popular with visitors to the area, as were cottages including The Rosery and Orchard Farm which served refreshments. In 1914, the Cavendish Pavilion was built as a private sports ground. The railway halt was rebuilt as a station in 1939.

In 1930, the housing developers Comben &amp; Wakeling purchased the Hawtrey family&#x27;s land, which included Eastcote House and its grounds, with the plan for the new Eastcote Park Estate. The estate - comprising Pamela Gardens, St Lawrence Drive, Rodney Gardens, Burwood Avenue and The Glen - would have necessitated the demolition of Eastcote House until this was purchased by the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council in 1937 for public use. Haydon Hall was purchased by the local council in 1936 after the death of its owner, Mrs Bennett-Edwards.
During the Second World War, Eastcote House was used to house the local branch of the Food Control Office, in charge of issuing ration books. The area was subjected to bombing by the Luftwaffe; 106 bombs fell on Eastcote between September 1940 and May 1941, from a total of 18 recorded raids.

The British government built a military hospital on land near Highgrove House during the war, in preparation for military casualties from the D-Day landings. They were not required for the role and were converted into barracks for Navy Wrens. Bletchley Park also established an outpost in surplus buildings on the site, which became known to staff as HMS Pembroke V. A total of 100 Bombe codebreaker machines were used to decode German Enigma messages. The station closed shortly after the war ended in 1945, although the operations from Bletchley Park were re-established on the site in April 1946, under the new name of &quot;Government Communications Headquarters&quot; (GCHQ). Operations continued on the site, including the use of two Colossus codebreaking machines, until GCHQ moved to a new purpose-built site in Cheltenham in February 1954.
In 1952, a number of new houses were built by Wimpeys Ltd in Newnham Avenue for the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council as part of their &quot;no fines&quot; scheme. The Minister for Housing and later Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, attended.

In 1964, Eastcote House was demolished after it was declared structurally unsafe. The grounds including the walled garden, coach house and dovecote were retained for public use. Haydon Hall had also fallen into a state of disrepair and was demolished in 1967.

The RAF Eastcote site was sold for development to George Wimpey (later Taylor Wimpey) in 2007, with plans for the construction of 385 new homes. As of early 2011, 50% of the development had been completed, and the estate renamed Pembroke Park, in reference to HMS Pembroke V, the former name of the codebreaking operation during the Second World War.

In November 2011 the public house The Manor was refurbished and renamed &quot;The Ascott&quot;, after the owners Greene King Brewery asked for public suggestions for a new name based on the local history of the area. The Case is Altered pub in Eastcote High Road is Grade II listed.

==Local government==
Eastcote was in the Ruislip-Northwood constituency until boundary changes at the 2010 general election split the seat into two constituencies, with most of the area becoming part of the Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner constituency, served by Conservative MP Nick Hurd who was first elected in 2005. The constituency is now served by David Simmonds. The remaining parts of the town, areas to the south of the North View/Village Way/Field End Road intersection are in the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, currently served by Steve Tuckwell.






==Localities==
Eastcote Village is the only named locality on Ordnance Survey maps, on slopes with elevations of 40–55m AOD above the rest of Eastcote and extends towards Ruislip Woods National Nature Reserve and Haste Hill. Eastcote Village surrounds a park-based conservation area that includes the Cricket pitch, Eastcote House Gardens and Haydon Hall Park on the upper slopes of the River Pinn. An adjoining conservation area, Eastcote Park, includes some of the south of Eastcote Village.

== Nearby areas ==

==Demography==
The local electoral ward is called Eastcote. The population as of 2015 was 12,600, of which 20.2% were of minority ethnicity. The median age as of 2013 was 44 years. 83.8% of houses are owned.

==Transport==

Eastcote Underground station is served by the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines.

Eastcote is served by three bus routes, though only two serve Eastcote itself. The London Bus routes 282 to Ealing Hospital (via Northolt) and Mount Vernon Hospital in Northwood, and 398 to Northolt&#x27;s Wood End Estate (via Rayners Lane) and Ruislip serve Eastcote. Route H13 to Ruislip Lido and Northwood Hills (via Pinner) does not serve Eastcote shopping parade itself, but does pass through the &quot;traditional&quot; Eastcote Village along High Road Eastcote. There is no direct bus link to Harrow, despite the H-prefix in H13.

<text>Hasselt is a city in the municipality of Zwartewaterland about 7 km (4.3 mi) north of Zwolle, in the Dutch province of Overijssel. After it received city rights in 1252, it became a member of the Hanseatic League around 1350. The city suffered an economic downfall from about 1550 on, as other cities proved to be better situated and equipped for trade and commerce. In 2001 the municipalities of Hasselt, Genemuiden and Zwartsluis were united in the municipality of Zwartewaterland, of which Hasselt became the administrative centre. As of 1 January 2021, Hasselt had a population of 7,385.

<text>Anders Norudde (born Anders Stake, 1960) is a Swedish folk musician, multi-instrumentalist, and luthier. After finishing school, Anders took a job at the ironworks in Degerfors, where, in his spare time, he practiced orienteering and played rock music on the guitar. After hearing the band Kebnekajse on the radio, Anders became interested in the melodies of traditional Swedish folk music. He began attending folk music festivals in Ransäter, Värmland and was particularly inspired by the music of Anders Rosén and Mats Edén of Groupa.

He also developed an interest in the construction of musical instruments and participated in a four-year course in violin making in Leksand. Graduation from this course qualified him as a member of S.V.I.T. (Swedish Violinmakers in the Italian Tradition). Anders has built 41 fiddles (including the viola d&#x27;amore played by Magnus Stinnerbom), and has sold all but one of them (a Hardanger fiddle that he still plays).
In 1987, he formed the band Hedningarna (meaning &quot;The Heathens) together with percussionist Björn Tollin and lutenist Hållbus Totte Mattson wanting to explore the possibilities of developing a new musical style based on elements of traditional music. The group wrote and played a major part in the music-to-theatre project &quot;Den stora vreden&quot; (rough translation: &quot;The Great Wrath&quot;) at Gävleborgs folkteater (the county theatre of Gävleborg), first time performed in 1988, that attracted much attention. A fairly large portion of the music on their first record was originally performed in that play.

Anders has dedicated an important amount of his creativity to the potentials offered by such ancient instruments as Swedish bagpipes, the moraharpa (an early predecessor of the nyckelharpa) and the sälgflöjt or willow flute. As part of his work with Hedningarna, Anders has constructed several unique instruments, some reproductions of ancient instruments such as the moraharpa, and some novel instruments based on a combination of traditional and modern design principles.

In the mid-&#x27;90s, Anders and his fiancée Ingrid spent a considerable amount of time and effort renovating the old cottage of Anders&#x27;s grandmother, located in the northern part of the Udden headland in Lake Ölen, Degerfors, for which they won an award. When they married in 1997, they decided that they would both take a new surname. They decided on &quot;Norudde&quot;, in honor of the cottage.

He currently lives in Karlskoga with his wife Ingrid and two children, John and Hedda.

<text>TAG Heuer S.A., founded Heuer AG ( ) is a Swiss luxury watchmaker. Founded in 1860 by Edouard Heuer in St-Imier, Switzerland, it was acquired by Techniques d&#x27;Avant Garde in 1985, which purchased a majority stake in the company, forming &quot;TAG Heuer&quot;. In 1999, French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH bought nearly 100 percent of the Swiss company. The name &quot;TAG Heuer&quot; combines the initials of &quot;Techniques d&#x27;Avant Garde&quot; and the founder&#x27;s surname.

==History==
TAG Heuer is based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, and is led by CEO Frédéric Arnault. Jack Heuer, great-grandson of the founder, is the honorary chairman. TAG Heuer maintains a watchmaking workshop in Cornol, Switzerland, and a watchmaking factory in La Chaux-de-Fonds. TAG Heuer&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Swiss Avant-Garde Since 1860&quot;.

===1860 through 1880s===
In 1860 Edouard Heuer founded Uhrenmanufaktur Heuer AG (English: Heuer Watchmaking Inc.) in St-Imier, Switzerland.

Edouard Heuer patented his first chronograph in 1882 and in 1887 patented an &quot;oscillating pinion&quot; still used by major watchmakers of mechanical chronographs.

===1910s===
In 1911, Heuer received a patent for the &quot;Time of Trip&quot;, the first dashboard chronograph. Designed for use in automobiles and aircraft, two large hands mounted from the center pinion indicate the time of day, as on a traditional clock. A small pair of hands mounted at the top of the dial (12 o&#x27;clock position) indicates the duration of the trip (up to 12 hours). A top-mounted crown allows the user to set the time; a button mounted in that crown operates the start/stop/reset functions of the &quot;duration of trip&quot; counter.

Heuer introduced its first wrist chronograph in 1914. The crown was at the 12 o&#x27;clock position, as these first wrist chronographs were adapted from pocket chronographs. In 1916 Edward Heuer&#x27;s son, Charles-Auguste, introduced the &quot;Mikrograph&quot;, the first stopwatch accurate to 1/100 of a second. This model was soon followed by the &quot;Semikrograph&quot;, a stopwatch that offered 1/50 of a second timing, as well as a split-second function (which allows the user to determine the interval between two contestants or events).

===1930s and 1940s===
In 1933, Heuer introduced the &quot;Autavia&quot;, a dashboard timer used for automobiles and aviation (whence its name, from &quot;AUTos&quot; and &quot;AVIAtion&quot;). The companion &quot;Hervue&quot; was a clock that could run for eight days without being wound. Over the period from 1935 through the early 1940s, Heuer manufactured chronographs for pilots in the Luftwaffe, known as &quot;Flieger&quot; (pilot) chronographs. The earlier version featured a hinged-back case and one pusher (for start/stop/reset); the later version had a snap-back case and added a second pusher (for time-in and time-out). All these Flieger chronographs had two-registers, with a capacity of 30 minutes.&quot;

In the mid-1940s, Heuer expanded its line of chronographs to include two- and three-register models and a three-register chronograph that had a full calendar function (day/date/month). As the highest development of Heuer&#x27;s chronographs, these &quot;triple calendar&quot; chronographs came in stainless steel and 14, 18, and 22 karat gold cases. Dial colors were white, black, or copper.

===1950s===
In the early-1950s, Heuer produced watches for the American retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. The &quot;Seafarer&quot; and &quot;Auto-Graph&quot; were chronographs produced by Heuer to be sold by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. The &quot;Seafarers&quot; had special dials—with blue, green, and yellow patterns—that showed the high and low tides. This dial could also be used to track the phases of the moon. Heuer produced a version of the &quot;Seafarer&quot; for sale under the Heuer name, with this model called the &quot;Mareographe&quot;. Heuer produced the &quot;Auto-Graph&quot; in 1953 and 1954, which featured a tachymeter scale on the dial and a hand that could be preset to a specific point on the scale. This complication allowed a rally driver or navigator to determine whether the car achieved the desired pace over a measured mile. Advertisements and literature also pointed out that this hand could be rotated to count golf scores or other events.

====Auto dashboard timers====
From 1911, Heuer manufactured timepieces to be mounted on the dashboards of automobiles, aircraft, and boats. These clocks and timers included a variety of models designed to address the specific needs of racers and rallyists. In 1958, Heuer introduced a new line of dashboard timepieces, which included the Master Time (8-day clock), the Monte Carlo (12-hour stopwatch), the Super Autavia (full chronograph), Sebring (60-minute, split-second timer), and Auto-Rallye (60-minute stopwatch). Heuer continued to manufacture these dashboard timepieces into the 1980s when Heuer discontinued them. Heuer also introduced timing devices for ski and motor racing events, including Formula One.

===1960s===
From the 1950s to the 1970s, Heuers were popular watches among automobile racers, both professionals and amateurs. Heuer was a leading producer of stopwatches and timing equipment, based on the volume of its sales, so it was only natural that racers, their crews and event sponsors began to wear Heuer chronographs. Heuer produced special chronograph versions with the logo of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, as well as the names or logos of racing teams or sponsors (for example, Shelby Cobra, MG and Champion Sparkplugs).

In 1962, Heuer became the first Swiss watchmaker in space. John Glenn wore a Heuer stopwatch when he piloted the Mercury Atlas 6 spacecraft on the first US crewed space flight to orbit the Earth. This stopwatch was the backup clock for the mission. It was started manually by Glenn 20 seconds into the flight. It is currently on display at the San Diego Air and Space Museum.

The Autavia chronograph was introduced in 1962 and featured a rotating bezel, marked in either hours, minutes, decimal minutes (1/100 minute increments), or with a tachymeter scale. All manual-wind Autavias from the 1960s had a black dial with white registers. Early cases had a screw-back, and later models (from and after 1968) had snap-backs. Heuer had previously used the &quot;Autavia&quot; name for its dashboard timers.

In 1963, Heuer introduced the Carrera chronograph, designed by Jack Heuer, great-grandson of Edouard. The Carrera had a very simple design, with only the registers and applied markers on the dial. The fixed inner bezel is divided into 1/5 second increments. In the 1960s, Carreras were available with a variety of dials, including all-white, all-black, white registers on a black dial, and black registers on a black dial. A three-register, triple calendar version of the Carrera was introduced around 1968.

Most of Heuer chronographs from this period—including the Autavias and Carreras—used movements manufactured by Valjoux, including the Valjoux 72 movement (for a 12-hour chronograph) and the Valjoux 92 movement (for a 30-minute or 45-minute chronograph). The Valjoux 72 movement utilized a &quot;tri-compax&quot; design, with three registers on the dial—one register for the chronograph hours (at the bottom), one register for the chronograph minutes (at the right), and a third register for a continuously running second hand (at the left). The second hand for the chronograph was mounted on the center pinion, along with the time-of-day hands.

Heuer acquired the &quot;Leonidas&quot; brand in the early 1960s, with the combined company marketing watches under the &quot;Heuer-Leonidas&quot; name. One of the designs that Heuer acquired from Leonidas was the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; chronograph, used by the German air force. These &quot;BWs&quot; feature a &quot;fly-back&quot; mechanism, so that when the chronograph is reset to zero, it immediately begins running again, to time the next segment or event.

====Automatic chronographs====
In the mid-1960s, Heuer partnered with Breitling and Hamilton (and in competition with Seiko and Zenith) to introduce an automatic chronograph. These projects were conducted in secret, as none of the competitors wanted the other companies to be aware of their efforts. Heuer-Breitling-Hamilton held press conferences in Geneva and New York, on 3 March 1969 to show their new lines of chronographs.

Heuer&#x27;s first automatic chronographs were the Autavia, Carrera, and Monaco. These were powered by the Cal 11 and Cal 12 movements (12-hour chronograph); Cal 14 movement (12-hour chronograph and additional hand for GMT/second time-zone) and the Cal 15 movement (30-minute chronograph). The winding crown was on the left, with the pushers for the chronograph on the right. The earliest of Heuer&#x27;s Cal 11 chronographs (from 1969) were named &quot;Chrono-Matic&quot;. In the early-1970s, Heuer expanded its line of automatic chronographs to include the Daytona, Montreal, Silverstone, Calculator, Monza, and Jarama models, all powered by the Calibre 11 movement.

===1970s===
In 1975, Heuer introduced the Chronosplit, a digital chronograph with dual LED and LCD displays. Later versions featured two LCD displays.

Heuer began using the Valjoux 7750 movement in its automatic chronographs, with the Kentucky and Pasadena models (both introduced in 1977). The Valjoux 7750 movement was a three-register chronograph (with seconds, minutes, and hours), that also offered day/date windows.

In the mid-1970s, Heuer introduced a series of chronographs powered by the Lemania 5100 movement. The Lemania 5100 movements have the minute hand for the chronograph on the center pinion (rather than on a smaller register), greatly improving legibility. The Lemania 5100 movement is considered very rugged and has been used in a variety of chronographs issued to military pilots. There are ten models of Heuer chronographs powered by the Lemania 5100—Reference 510.500 (stainless steel), 510.501 (black coated), 510.502 (olive drab coated), 510.503 (pewter-coated), 510.511 (Carrera dialed acrylic crystal PVD finish), 510.523 (Carrera dialed acrylic crystal stainless steel), as well as models with the names Silverstone (steel case with black dial) and Cortina (steel case with blue dial); the Reference 510.543 was made for the A.M.I. (Italian Air Force) and a special edition (with no reference number marked on the case) was made for AudiSport.

===1980–present===
TAG Heuer was formed in 1985 when TAG Group (Holdings) S.A., manufacturers of high-tech items such as ceramic turbochargers for Formula One cars, acquired Heuer. Akram Ojjeh, the owner of TAG Heuer sold a significant stake of the company to British businessman Ron Dennis.

In 1999 TAG Heuer accepted a bid from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A. of CHF 1.15 billion (£452.15 million, USD 739 million), contingent upon a transfer of 50.1 percent of stock.

In 2010, TAG Heuer introduced the &quot;Pendulum Concept&quot;, the first magnetic oscillator without hairspring capable of providing restoring torque comparable to that of hairspring.

In 2013, TAG Heuer celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carrera, the racing-inspired chronograph that is a key part of the TAG Heuer range today. There have been ten generations of Carrera since its introduction, with models launched in every decade since 1963.

In 2017 TAG Heuer released limited edition Muhammad Ali watch.

== Motto and slogan ==
A company slogan of TAG Heuer is &quot;Don&#x27;t Crack Under Pressure&quot;. The slogan was originally introduced in 1991.

== Watch manufacturing ==
===Watches===

TAG Heuer&#x27;s current lines include Formula One, Aquaracer, Link, Carrera, Monaco, Connected, Autavia, and Heuer Heritage.

Some of the more recently announced models include the Monaco V4 (the movement of which is driven by belts rather than gears); the Carrera Calibre 360 (the first mechanical wrist chronograph to measure and display time to 1/100 of a second) and the Monaco 69 (with both a digital chronograph accurate to a millisecond and a traditional mechanical movement, with a hinged mechanism allowing wearers to flip the watch between its two separate dials).

London-based Christoph Behling has been the lead designer for TAG Heuer since 2004. The collaboration has resulted in some of the brand&#x27;s most celebrated pieces including the world&#x27;s fastest chronograph, the Mikrogirder 1/2000, launched in 2012.

Many TAG Heuer watches feature chronographs. In January 2011 TAG Heuer announced the new Carrera Mikrograph, the first TAG Heuer to use the in-house Mikrograph movement, which is accurate to 1/100 of a second. Additionally, TAG Heuer has also released the limited edition Carrera MP4-12C to commemorate the launch of the McLaren MP4-12C supercar. TAG Heuer has been a partner of the McLaren F1 team for over 26 years.

At the Basel 2011 show in March 2011, TAG Heuer announced the Mikrotimer Flying 1000, a concept mechanical watch capable of accuracy of 1/1000 of a second—ten times faster than the Mikrograph.

This mark was superseded in January 2012 with the Mikrogirder model, precise to 5/10,000 of a second.

====TAG Heuer Connected====
On November 9, 2015, TAG Heuer announced the launch of their first smartwatch which they named Tag Heuer Connected. The watch runs on the Android Wear operating system which is used by many smartwatch brands.

TAG Heuer Connected also offers its own app which principally offers several custom TAG Heuer watch faces which include &quot;Three-Hand&quot;, &quot;Chronograph&quot;, &quot;GMT&quot;, &quot;Themed&quot;, &quot;Ambassador&quot; and &quot;Exclusive&quot; watch faces. Each watch face (other than Ambassador and Exclusive) offer black, blue and white backgrounds. The app also provides three smart functions which are a stopwatch, alarm and timer.

All other smartwatch functions and apps are driven via the Android Wear operating system.

In March 2017, TAG Heuer introduced a new smartwatch, TAG Heuer&#x27;s Connected Modular 45, which allows its owners to switch between connected and mechanical modules.

In May 2017, TAG Heuer partnered with 20th Century Fox to make the TAG Heuer Connected the official watch of &quot;&quot;.

===Other products===
Morez, France-based Groupe Logo manufactures TAG Heuer-branded eyewear under a licence acquired in 2002.

Paris, France-based ModeLabs Group manufactures TAG Heuer-branded mobile phone under licence. ModeLabs acquired the license in late-2007 and marketed the first TAG Heuer branded mobile phone in late 2008.

The company also markets a line of men&#x27;s accessories including wallets, belts, bags, jackets, bracelets, and cuff-links.

===Awards===
In 2007, TAG Heuer won the iF product design award for its Monaco Calibre 360 LS Concept Chronograph. The award was given away by the International Forum Design Hannover GmbH, held in Hanover, Germany. The watch received the award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category. It was chosen among more than 2,200 timepieces presented by watchmakers from 35 countries. TAG Heuer received the iF product design award for the second time in two years. In 2006, another TAG Heuer watch, entitled Professional Golf Watch, won in the same Leisure/Lifestyle category. The design of the Professional Golf Watch was developed with Tiger Woods.

In 2010 the Carrera 1887 won &quot;La Petite Aiguille&quot; (&quot;the small hand&quot;) award for watches retailing for less than CHF5,000 at the Grand Prix d&#x27;Horlogerie de Genève.

=== Environmental rating ===

In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. TAG Heuer, along with Chopard, was given a below-average environmental rating as &quot;Lower Midfield&quot;, suggesting that the manufacturer has only taken a few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change.

In the jewelry and watchmaking industries, there are general concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials, such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues, such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world&#x27;s annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies.

==Notable patrons and owners==
TAG Heuer, in keeping with its image as a luxury brand with an innovative spirit, has long-standing links with the world of sport and Hollywood. The brand has had a long list of sports and Hollywood ambassadors. In addition, TAG Heuer has paid numerous celebrities to endorse its products, including: Tom Brady, Ayrton Senna, Kevin Richardson, Cristiano Ronaldo, Chris Hemsworth, Jessica Michibata, Tiger Woods, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Sarah Fisher, Louis Koo, Chen Daoming, G.E.M. Tang, Jeff Gordon, Maria Sharapova, Jeremy Lin, Juan Pablo Montoya, Kimi Räikkönen, Uma Thurman, Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Sergio Pérez, Therese Johaug, Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Cameron Diaz, Sydney McLaughlin, Steve McQueen, Ranbir Kapoor, Mary Kom, Alexander Rossi and Li Yifeng.

Steve McQueen wore a blue Monaco in the 1971 movie &quot;Le Mans&quot; (this model is now referred to as the &quot;McQueen Monaco&quot;), and Swiss Formula One star Jo Siffert customarily wore a white-dialed Autavia with black registers. In 1974, Heuer produced a special version of the black-dialed Autavia that was offered by the Viceroy cigarette company for US$88. This version of the Autavia was called the &quot;Viceroy&quot; and advertisements for this promotion featured racer Parnelli Jones.

== Sponsorship ==

From 2017 to 2020, TAG Heuer was the official timekeeper for &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot;, a racing video game that was released on PlayStation 4.

===Motorsport===

TAG Heuer is an official partner of the Red Bull Racing Formula One team, and sponsored Red Bull&#x27;s Renault-manufactured power units from 2016 to 2018. TAG, now known as TAG Group which is no longer affiliated with TAG Heuer, sponsored Formula One team Williams during the early 1980s. TAG also gave its name to the Porsche engines used by the McLaren F1 team from 1983 through 1987, and remained a sponsor until 2015. TAG Group continues to hold a stake in McLaren. Heuer was the official timepiece of the Scuderia Ferrari F1 team in the 1970s, prior to the TAG acquisition.

The endorsement with Red Bull was part of a larger promotional outreach program by former TAG Heuer CEO Jean-Claude Biver to enter into markets that may not necessarily be traditional markets for the company, an idea Biver calls &quot;Universes&quot;, which include sport, heritage, lifestyle and art and music. Other brand ambassadors in the &quot;Universes&quot; program include David Guetta, OneRepublic, Martin Garrix, Cara Delevingne, Chris Hemsworth, Manchester United F.C. and Muhammad Ali.

Starting in May 2018, TAG Heuer picked up the sponsorship of the pagoda at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and also sponsors the IndyCar Series.

TAG Heuer is also the title sponsor of the Porsche Formula E Team.

<text>The Nene Valley Railway (NVR) is a preserved railway in Cambridgeshire, England, running between Peterborough Nene Valley and Yarwell Junction. The line is in length. There are stations at each terminus, and three stops en route: Orton Mere, Overton and Wansford.

==History==

===Origins===

In 1845, the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) company was given parliamentary assent to construct a line from Blisworth in Northamptonshire to Peterborough. Completed in 1847, it was Peterborough&#x27;s first railway line. It terminated at Peterborough, later &#x27;Peterborough East&#x27; station.

The line was of little significance until the late 19th century, when the London &amp; North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR), which had absorbed the L&amp;BR, constructed a line via Nassington and King&#x27;s Cliffe to Seaton, below Welland Viaduct. This turned Wansford, previously an unimportant village station, into a major junction. Its importance increased a few years later when the Great Northern Railway constructed another line via Sutton, Southorpe and Barnack to Stamford, on the Midland Railway line. In 1884 the line received a royal visit when the royal family travelled from Peterborough to Barnwell, some beyond Wansford, to visit Barnwell Manor, home of the then Duke of Gloucester. The station building is now preserved at Wansford station on the NVR, and is known as the Barnwell building.

Between 1900 and the 1960s, the line formed an important connection from Norwich, Cambridge and eastern England to Northampton and the Midlands. The line was generally acknowledged to be a secondary main line and frequently saw large engines such as Black 5s and B1s. However, the NVR was one of the last passenger line closures of the Dr Beeching era, services to Northampton and Rugby having ceased in 1964 and 1966 respectively. It remained open until 1972 for freight traffic only.

===Society formed===

In 1968, the Rev. Richard Paten had bought BR Standard Class 5 4-6-0 locomotive, number &quot;73050&quot;, for its scrap value of £3,000. His intention had been to exhibit it outside Peterborough Technology College as a monument to Peterborough&#x27;s railway history. However, the locomotive was found to be in good working order, and there was much opposition to the idea of the engine being &quot;stuffed&quot;, and it was decided to restore it to full working order.

On 28 March 1969, the Peterborough Branch of the East Anglian Locomotive Society was formed, with the intention of purchasing and restoring the BR Pacific locomotive, number BR Standard Class 7 70000 &quot;Britannia&quot;. By 1970, the branch was strong enough to operate independently as the Peterborough Locomotive Society (PLS). In 1971, &quot;73050&quot; was moved to the British Sugar Corporation&#x27;s sidings at Fletton, where it was joined by Hunslet 0-6-0 locomotive &#x27;Jack&#x27;s Green&#x27;. Later that year, the PLS held a meeting at which the group&#x27;s name was changed to &#x27;Peterborough Railway Society&#x27; and the idea of the Nene Valley Railway was formally launched.

===Purchase of line and locomotives===

In 1974, the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC) bought the Nene Valley line between Longville and Yarwell Junctions and it began leasing it to the PRS to operate the railway – a major milestone in the society&#x27;s history.

When the PRS acquired the line, the intention was to work the line with British locomotives and stock. However, enthusiasts from other railways and preservation societies had already acquired almost all of the serviceable ex-BR locomotives – all that was left was a collection of rusting hulks. Apart from 73050, the society&#x27;s locomotives were mostly small, industrial shunting engines and therefore not suitable for the round trip. Ex-BR rolling stock was also in very short supply following the disposal of most pre-nationalisation (pre-1948) stock. The PDC, having paid out a considerable sum of money for the line, was anxious that trains should start running as soon as possible – certainly before the opening of the new Nene Park in 1978. However, with the PRC&#x27;s lack of stock and locomotives this looked highly improbable.

In 1973, PRS member Richard Hurlock had approached the society for a home for his ex-Swedish State Railways (SJ) class S1 2-6-4T oil-fired locomotive, number &quot;1928&quot;. Because the engine was higher and wider than British stock, it was to be a static exhibition only. During 1974, it was realised that the use of foreign stock and engines could answer the NVR&#x27;s aspirations. After a feasibility study was carried out, it was discovered that only one bridge would have to be demolished to allow the running to continental loading gauge. Some reductions would also have to be made to the width of the platforms. In 1973, BR gave PRS permission to use Wansford signal box and, in September of that year, the first items of stock arrived at the PRS depot.

===Operation===
Before the stock could be moved from the BSC depot to Wansford, the missing of the Fletton Loop had to be rebuilt, allowing access to the Nene Valley line. The track was completed in March 1974 and the stock moved to Wansford in time for the Easter weekend, when the new &#x27;Wansford Steam Centre&#x27; opened for the first time. Between 1974 and 1977, the line was upgraded to passenger-carrying standard and the first passenger train ran on 1 June 1977, hauled by the &#x27;Nord 3.628&#x27; – a French 4-6-0 locomotive and &#x27;SJ 1178&#x27; – another Swedish tank engine, pulling a set of ex-BR electrical multiple unit coaches owned by the Southern Electric Group.

===Extension to Peterborough===
In the early 1980s, the NVR decided to extend its running line, which then terminated at Orton Mere station, along the route of the original Nene Valley Line to a new station west of the East Coast Main Line, adjacent to the new Railworld Museum. Peterborough Nene Valley opened, for the first time, on the Late Spring Bank Holiday weekend of 26 May 1986. This extended the NVR to its current length, .

===Future===
In 2024, the Nene Valley Railway and Railworld Nature Reserve acquired the former Wansford Road Station. Built in 1869, it served the branch line to Stamford, Lincolnshire until it closed in 1929. In 2022, the station and platform were facing demolition by National Highways for the new dual carriageway between Wansford and Sutton. It will be dismantled stone by stone and reconstructed at the eastern end of the railway.

==Stations==

===Yarwell Junction===

&quot;Yarwell Junction&quot; is the former junction between the lines to Northampton and Market Harborough. It is the current terminus of the NVR&#x27;s operating line. In April 2006 the track was realigned, allowing a platform to be built at Yarwell Junction, which opened at Easter 2007 (there was never previously a station on the site). The new station is linked by footpaths to Nassington and the mill village of Yarwell, but there is no vehicular access. Yarwell Junction is about west of Wansford station, at the other end of Yarwell Tunnel.

===Wansford===

Wansford is the headquarters of the railway and most of the facilities are based here. The current station building was opened in 1995 and contains a ticket office, shop, cafe and toilets. The locomotive sheds are located at this station. Also at the station there is a miniature railway, picnic area and children&#x27;s playground. The station was formerly the junction for a branch to Stamford, which diverged to the north just east of the river bridge at Wansford. The original Wansford station is located on platform three and was built in 1844–1845 in Jacobean style for the opening of the railway. This building was purchased by the railway in 2015.

===Castor===

&quot;Castor&quot; is a disused station between Wansford and Ferry Meadows. It closed in the 1960s and despite the NVR (which runs through it) reopening, the station remains closed.

=== Overton (for Ferry Meadows) ===

Overton (for Ferry Meadows) is located near the site of Orton Waterville station and provides access to the nearby country park. The current building was moved brick by brick from the old goods yard at Fletton Junction on the East Coast Main Line; it replaced a portable building desperately in need of repair. NVR has now added a canopy. The station building was offered to the NVR for £1 plus transportation costs. The Park is open throughout the year, but most facilities such as the miniature railway and pedaloes only run from Easter to the end of October. The station is also the site of the new Night Mail Museum, with construction well under way with some exhibits open to view. Overton station was renamed Overton &#x27;for Ferry Meadows&#x27; in 2017 in conjunction with the Nene Valley Railway&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations.

===Orton Mere===

&quot;Orton Mere&quot; is a two platform station with a station building built in 1983 and a signal box. Until 1986 this was the terminus of the line. Most trains depart from platform 1. Just outside the station towards Peterborough is the Fletton Loop which links the NVR to the mainline. The signal box controls the passing loop. It was badly damaged in 2023 by an arson attack. Following fund raising by two local youngsters the box has been fully rebuilt and recommissioned.

This station provides access to the eastern end of the Nene Park.

===Longville Junction===
&quot;Longville (or Longueville) Junction&quot; is about from Peterborough (Nene Valley) and links to the nearby East Coast Main Line. As of March 2013, there is no platform here, as Orton Mere station is only a few hundred yards close by.

===Peterborough (Nene Valley)===
&quot;Peterborough Nene Valley&quot; (aka Peterborough West), is the current end of the line. Here there is a platform, a bay platform and a station building housing a ticket office, a small souvenir shop and toilets. It is a 10-minute walk from here to Peterborough City Centre. Railworld is next door to the station with a wide variety of rolling stock on display. It is currently planned to relocate the station building currently at Wansford Road Station (on the old line from Wansford to Stamford) to here.

==Locomotives==
The Nene Valley Railway has a full-scale &quot;replica&quot; of Thomas the Tank Engine working a passenger and freight service on &#x27;Thomas&#x27; events; it was the first railway in the world to possess one. The Nene Valley Railway considers its Thomas to be the &quot;official&quot; Thomas the Tank Engine, because it was named by Thomas&#x27; creator, the Rev. W. Awdry, in 1971. The replica engine runs at certain special events, weekends and bank holidays; however, the Nene Valley Railway does not host official &#x27;Day out with Thomas&#x27; events as many railways do. Unsuccessfully, HiT Entertainment tried to sue the Nene Valley Railway on the grounds that their Thomas locomotive was breaching their trademark, but they lost the case as the court ruled that it was not breaching HiT&#x27;s trademark because the Hudswell Clarke locomotive was given the name &quot;Thomas&quot; by the creator, Rev. W. Awdry.

==Rolling stock==
Nene Valley Railway&#x27;s coaching stock includes not only the BR Mk. I and BR Mk. II carriages commonly seen on preserved railways in the UK, but also prewar coaching stock from France, Norway, Belgium, Italy, and Denmark.

The railway also owns an ex Southern Railways travelling post office dating to the 1930s, a Victorian era Great Northern Railway parcels van, and an ex London, Midland and Scottish Railway sorting office carriage from the Great Train Robbery. Demonstration 4 coach mail trains have been run between Sutton Cross and Wansford since 2009.

Nene Valley has a large collection of vintage railway wagons, some operational and others undergoing restoration.

==Signalling==

The Nene Valley Railway is divided into four absolute block sections, controlled by staff and ticket working: Yarwell to Wansford, Wansford to Orton Mere, Orton Mere to Peterborough NVR and Orton Mere to the Fletton Junction with the East Coast Main Line. The signalbox at Orton Mere can be switched out, creating a single section all the way from Wansford to Peterborough and isolating the Fletton Branch, allowing the entire railway to be operated from Wansford; in this case the Peterborough NVR token key is kept physically clipped to the Orton Mere train staff. The staff for the Fletton branch was previously kept at Peterborough powerbox, but is now in possession of the NVR, along with the branch itself.

All points and signals are operated by heritage electrical and mechanical systems. There are two crossovers, one at Wansford and one at Orton Mere, driven by electric point motors; the Orton Mere crossover was converted from all-mechanical in 2015. The majority of the signals are upper-quadrant mechanical semaphore arms, though four lower-quadrant Great Northern somersault signals are mounted on a gantry controlling down trains out of Wansford. Lights at Orton Mere indicate that the crossover has operated correctly, and flashing white lights at Overton indicate that the automatic level crossing warning lights are showing.

Wansford signalbox was built in 1907 around a 30-bar London and North Western Railway lever frame of 60 levers; levers 1 to 15 were removed when the Stamford Line was closed. A later addition is a mechanical gated level crossing, operated from a &quot;ship&#x27;s wheel&quot; at the West end of the &#x27;box. The gates were replaced with ones made new in-house over the Winter of 2022-23, replacing a previous set made in the 1990s. The Wansford crossing includes wicket gates on the East side for pedestrian traffic when the old Great North Road was a busier route; these can be locked shut from the signalbox, and are currently being replaced.

Access to the loco yard is controlled by a two-lever ground frame released from the signalbox; this is because a point motor was not available at the time, and replacing it is a job which has never been got round to. A single-lever ground frame controlling access to the Carriage and Wagon Shed requires the Wansford-Yarwell train staff. The West end of Wansford station is thoroughly track-circuited; nearby &quot;miniature&quot; relays pick up low Voltage signals applied to the rails and re-transmit them at 50 Volts to the signalbox where shelf relays interlock them with the rest of the signalling. Most of the track circuits are DC, but a recently-installed AC track circuit extends to the tunnel mouth. At the East end, the points are protected by a mechanical flange bar which prevents them from being unlocked when a train is present.

At Yarwell, the run-round loop is controlled by a single-lever ground frame requiring the train staff. A possible future application of a colour-light signal is to provide an outer home signal to allow shunting to take place on the main line at Wansford while a train is in section.

For demonstrating the Travelling Post Office (TPO) apparatus, a starter signal can be operated from a nearby ground frame, giving the demonstration train a good run-up from a standing start. This signal is normally kept &#x27;off&#x27; (allowing trains to pass); to operate the frame one must be in possession of a padlock key, and also a battery to power the electric lever lock in lieu of a release from Wansford signalbox.

Overton Station is equipped with an automatic level crossing which includes the BR prototype solid-state flash circuit driving the flashing warning lights. Access to the sidings here is controlled by a two-lever ground frame requiring the train staff.

Orton Mere signalbox was brought to the Nene Valley Railway in the 1980s, and contains a 12-lever Midland Railway lever frame. When the &#x27;box is not being used, a king lever renders parts of the frame&#x27;s mechanical interlocking as two disconnected areas of influence, allowing the signals to be pulled off for both directions. The signalling here was substantially augmented in 2015 with the addition of track circuits and the electrification of the crossover. A &#x27;selector locking&#x27; mechanism, by which one lever operates one of two signals depending on the position of the points, was removed, but is hoped to be reused at the West end of the station.

Orton Mere signalbox was subject to an arson attack early in 2023, leaving much of the interior damaged and the electrical instruments destroyed. Repairs and improvements were funded by the efforts of two young local enthusiasts, and the &#x27;box was ceremonially re-opened on 9 March 2024.

The signalbox at Peterborough NVR is currently unused, though it is a current project to use it to control access to the Railworld site next-door. It contains a 40-lever Great Northern frame. The run-round loop is controlled at the West end by a two-lever ground frame requiring the Orton Mere - Peterborough NVR train staff, and by a hand-point at the East end.

Communication is mostly carried by hand-held radio, but signal-post telephones are available around Wansford. Wansford and Orton Mere signalboxes are connected by block bell which is regularly used on galas and some service timetables; the block bell in Orton Mere &#x27;box is of the BR modular &quot;penguin&quot; type. A block instrument and a Tyer&#x27;s No. 9 electric token instrument in Wansford &#x27;box are not used.

==As a film location==
The line has been a location for filming over 150 TV shows, films, adverts and music videos.

Between 1977 and 1979, many sequences for the BBC&#x27;s wartime drama &quot;Secret Army&quot; were filmed here, principally at Wansford station.

In 1982, Wansford station was used for six weeks to shoot scenes featuring Roger Moore and Maud Adams for the James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot;.

Scenes for the biplane/helicopter dogfight from the 1986 film &quot;&quot; were filmed here, involving one memorable shot where the helicopter piloted by Biggles &quot;lands&quot; on a flat-bed railway carriage. 

In 1989, Nene Valley was used for the filming of &quot;Breakthru&quot; (a song by Queen) where the band members all performed on a Great Western Railway steam train no.3822.

Another Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was also filmed on the line in 1995. For the film, a Class 20 was disguised as a Russian armoured train. In the film, a tunnel that the train seemingly goes into is in fact a small bridge over the tracks.

In 2008, Penélope Cruz and Daniel Day-Lewis were among the actors who worked on the filming of the live-action film &quot;Nine&quot; on the Railway.

TV shows filmed here include &quot;EastEnders, Casualty, Silent Witness, Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; and &quot;Poirot&quot;.

<text>William Ronald Rhys Jones (26 December 1915 – 22 May 1987), who used the name Keidrych Rhys, was a Welsh literary journalist and editor, and a poet. He was editor of the periodical, &quot;Wales&quot;, published from 1937 to 1949 and from 1958 to 1960.

==Biography==
William Ronald Rhys Jones was born in Wales in 1915, at Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire.

In 1937 he began the publication of the literary periodical, Wales. He remained editor of the periodical throughout its life, from 1937 to 1949 and from 1958 to 1960.

in 1939 he married the poet Lynette Roberts. Throughout the 1940s they lived at Llanybri, Carmarthenshire, and had two children: their daughter, Angharad (born 1945) and their son, Pridein (born 1946). During this period Faber published his collection of poems, &quot;The Van Pool&quot; (1942) and his wife&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; (1944).

In 1949 he and his wife divorced. In that year publication of the periodical, Wales, was discontinued, and did not resume until 1958, by which time Rhys was living in London.

He lived at Penybont farm, Llangadock, Carmarthen.

He died on 22 May 1987. An archive of his manuscripts is held at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. Photographic portraits of Rhys by Howard Coster and Ida Kar are held by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

==&quot;Wales&quot; magazine==
&quot;See main article Wales (magazine)&quot;

From 1937 to 1949 and from 1958 to 1960 his editorship of the magazine, &quot;Wales&quot;, made it a channel for English-language writing in Wales. In the magazine Rhys published articles, stories and poems by Welsh writers or writers involved with Wales, such as Alun Lewis, Saunders Lewis, Dylan Thomas, Glyn Jones and Lynette Roberts. The magazine was an attempt to provide a platform for &quot;younger progressive Welsh writers&quot; who felt that their contribution to British culture was marginalised, and contributed to the creation of the concept of Anglo-Welsh literature or Welsh writing in English.

The poet Robert Graves wrote to Rhys and Lynette Roberts that he hoped that the periodical &quot;Wales&quot; might be a &#x27;record-vehicle&#x27; for a new movement of tradition-minded yet modern Celtic poets. Drafts of parts of his book on mythology, &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, were published there in 1944 and 1945 as three articles, &#x27;Dog&#x27;, &#x27;Roebuck&#x27; and &#x27;Lapwing&#x27;.

The magazine is being digitized by the &quot;Welsh Journals Online project&quot; at the National Library of Wales.

<text>Vreeland () is a village in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It was a part of the former municipality of Loenen. Since 2011 it has been part of the new formed municipality of Stichtse Vecht. It is located on the river Vecht, about 2 km north of Loenen aan de Vecht. It received city rights in 1265. In 2015, the village celebrates the 650th year of its foundation.

Vreeland is on the provincial road Vinkeveen-Hilversum (N201). Until 1964, Vreeland was a separate municipality.

In 2001, the village of Vreeland had 1339 inhabitants. The built-up area of the village was 0.30 km2, and contained 557 residences.
The statistical area &quot;Vreeland&quot;, which also can include the peripheral parts of the village, as well as the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 1600.

==Economy==

Vreeland is situated in the Vechtstreek, called after the river &quot;Vecht&quot;. It is surrounded by several lakes, including the Loosdrecht and Kortenhoef Lakes. River and lakes are used for water recreation. Several bike routes transverse the village, making it a touristic attraction when the weather is fine.

Two important hiking routes traverse the village: the &quot;Floris de Vijfde&quot; path and the &quot;Waterlinie&quot; path; they were opened in September 2004.

In summer there is a buzz from tourists on water as well on land. Almost every season has a festival or party, such as an Autumn Market, a Christmas Market and King&#x27;s Day (April 27).

<text>Goor () is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located about west of Enschede. Goor received city rights in 1263.

Goor was a separate municipality until 2001, when it became part of Hof van Twente. Goor had a statue of Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol, but it was destroyed in 1787 by royalist Orangists in the defeat of the republican movement.

==Jewish community==
While records of individual Jews in Goor date back to the 14th century, the first permanent records of a Jewish community date to the 1600s when residence permits were issued to Jews.

The &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Jewish cemetery&#x27;) of Goor on the Borghoek dates to 1720. The Jewish population expanded rapidly in the second half of the 18th century. In 1748, Goor had 13 Jewish residents; that number increased to 238 Jews by 1809. In 1821, the Jews of Goor joined with Jews living in the neighboring towns of Diepenheim and Markelo to build the &quot;Ringsynagoge&quot; (&#x27;regional synagogue&#x27;).

The Jewish community thrived throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Jews contributed to the economic development of Goor and the Twente region. The Jewish Lavino brothers set up a weaving school in Goor. Godfried Salomonson (1838–1911), a Jewish man, established the &quot;Koninklijke Stoomweverij te Nijverdal&quot; (&#x27;the Royal Nijverdal Steam Bleaching Works&#x27;) in 1836 with the express purpose of serving as the center of the Dutch Industrial Revolution. In 1902, a new synagogue on Schoolstraat replaced the old &quot;Ringsynagoge&quot;.

As antisemitism gripped Nazi Germany in the late 1920s, Goor (like the rest of the Netherlands) saw an influx of Jewish refugees. The Nazis occupied the Netherlands in 1940. On March 24, 1945, Allied bombers hit and damaged the Goor Synagogue which had survived the Nazi occupation as a storehouse. During the war, nearly the entire Jewish community had been openly murdered or sent to concentration camps where they were killed.

In 1970, the Dutch government erected a national monument in the &quot;Joodse gemeenschap&quot;, memorializing the Jews whom the Nazis murdered.

<doc id="907804" wikidata="Q2395228" url="?curid=907804" title="Reality distortion field">
<text>Reality distortion field (RDF) is a term first used by Bud Tribble at Apple Computer in 1981, to describe company co-founder Steve Jobs&#x27;s charisma and its effects on the developers working on the Macintosh project. Tribble said that the term came from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, where it is used to describe how the aliens encountered by the crew of the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; created their own new world through mental force. 

==Steve Jobs==
In the book &quot;Steve Jobs&quot;, biographer Walter Isaacson states that around 1972, while Jobs was attending Reed College, Robert Friedland &quot;taught Steve the reality distortion field.&quot; The RDF was said by Andy Hertzfeld to be Jobs&#x27;s ability to convince himself, and others around him, to believe almost anything with a mix of charm, charisma, bravado, hyperbole, marketing, appeasement and persistence. It was said to distort his co-workers&#x27; sense of proportion and scales of difficulties and to make them believe that whatever impossible task he had at hand was possible. Jobs could also use the reality distortion field to appropriate others&#x27; ideas as his own, sometimes proposing an idea back to its originator, only a week after dismissing it.

The term has been used to refer to Jobs&#x27;s keynote speeches (or &quot;Stevenotes&quot;) by observers and devoted users of Apple computers and products, and derisively by Apple&#x27;s competitors in criticisms of Apple, for example a post on Research In Motion&#x27;s official BlackBerry blog titled &quot;RIM Responds to Apple&#x27;s &#x27;Distortion Field&#x27;&quot;.

Bill Gates talked in an interview about Steve Jobs using his reality distortion field to &quot;cast spells&quot; on people. Gates considered himself immune to Jobs&#x27;s reality distortion field, saying, &quot;I was like a minor wizard because he would be casting spells, and I would see people mesmerized, but because I&#x27;m a minor wizard, the spells don&#x27;t work on me.&quot;

==Other instances==
The term has been extended, with a mixture of awe and scorn, to other managers and leaders in industry who try to convince their employees to become passionately committed to projects without regard to their overall difficulty or to competitive forces in the market. It is sometimes used with regard to excessively hyped products that are not necessarily connected with any one person.
* Bill Clinton&#x27;s charisma has been called a reality distortion field.
* The chess champion Bobby Fischer was said to have a &quot;Fischer aura&quot; surrounding him that disoriented Boris Spassky and other opponents.
* The term has been also associated with Donald Trump&#x27;s approach to running his 2016 campaign for United States President and his presidency.
*&quot;Financial Times&quot; used the term when describing Elon Musk.
*WeWork founder Adam Neumann has been described as having a reality distortion field.
*A parody of a reality distortion field appeared in a 2010 &quot;Dilbert&quot; strip in which a reality distortion field emitter is used during a keynote speech by Dogbert.
* Columnist Yen Makabenta of &quot;The Manila Times&quot; opined that Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s rise to prominence and appeal to the masses—in spite of allegations of human rights violations and Duterte&#x27;s obscene remarks towards individuals and organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church, which the Philippines has a significant population of adherents—have generated a reality distortion field. He added that while Duterte&#x27;s vulgar and sexually charged comments during his presidential campaign have alarmed many and were initially seen as detrimental to his victory as a presidential candidate, he exhibited charisma which accounted for why people still campaigned for him in spite of this behavior.

<doc id="907810" wikidata="Q276604" url="?curid=907810" title="William B. Bate">
<text>William Brimage Bate (October 7, 1826March 9, 1905) was a planter and slaveholder, Confederate officer, and politician in Tennessee. After the Reconstruction era, he served as the 23rd governor of Tennessee from 1883 to 1887. He was elected to the United States Senate from Tennessee, serving from 1887 until his death.

During the Civil War, he had fought for the Confederacy, eventually rising to the rank of major general and commanding a division in the Army of Tennessee. Bate saw action in multiple engagements throughout the war, and was seriously wounded on two occasions.

==Early life and career==
Bate was born in Bledsoe&#x27;s Lick (now Castalian Springs) in Sumner County, Tennessee, the son of James H. Bate and the former Amanda Weatherred. He attended a log schoolhouse known as the &quot;Rural Academy&quot;. When he was 15, his father died, and he left home to find work. He was eventually hired as a clerk on the steamboat, &quot;Saladin&quot;, which traveled up and down the Cumberland, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers between Nashville and New Orleans.

While his steamboat was docked in New Orleans, word came of the outbreak of the Mexican–American War in 1848, and Bate enlisted in a Louisiana regiment. When this enlistment ended a few months later, he reenlisted with the rank of lieutenant in Company I of the 3rd Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. He accompanied General Joseph Lane on several raids in pursuit of Santa Anna toward the end of the war.

After the war, Bate returned to his family farm in Sumner County, and established a pro-Democratic Party newspaper, the &quot;Tenth Legion&quot;, in nearby Gallatin. He was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1849. In 1852, he obtained his law degree from Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee and was admitted to the bar. After the state constitution was amended to allow for direct election of judicial officers in 1854, Bate was elected attorney general for the Nashville district.

Bate campaigned for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Johnson in 1855, and was an elector for Southern Democratic presidential candidate John C. Breckinridge in 1860. He was offered his district&#x27;s nomination for Congress in 1859, but declined. He was a staunch supporter of secession in the years leading up to the Civil War.

==American Civil War==

Following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, Bate enlisted in a private company in Gallatin, and was elected as its captain. In early May, after Tennessee aligned with the Confederacy, Bate was elected colonel of the 2nd Tennessee Infantry. This unit was quickly dispatched to Virginia, where it was among the forces tasked with guarding the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. Bate was present at the Battle of Aquia Creek on May 30, 1861. At the First Battle of Bull Run (First Battle of Manassas) in July 1861, Bate was in the reserve brigade of Theophilus Holmes in the Confederate Army of the Potomac.

Bate&#x27;s unit remained on the Potomac River until February 1862, when, at his request, his unit was transferred to the Western Theater. The 2nd Tennessee was placed under Albert Sidney Johnston&#x27;s Army of Mississippi, which was conducting operations in the Corinth area. Bate&#x27;s unit marched north with the Army of Mississippi in its attempt to check Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s advance at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Bate was wounded severely in the leg during the first day&#x27;s fighting, and an Army surgeon told him it would be necessary to amputate his leg to save his life. Bate drew his pistol, threatening to shoot the surgeon, and kept his leg. Although he survived, he was incapacitated for several months, and walked with a limp the rest of his life. Several of Bate&#x27;s relatives were killed at Shiloh, and his horse was shot out from under him.

After spending several months recovering in Columbus, Mississippi, Bate was promoted to brigadier general on October 2, 1862. He was initially given tasks away from the frontlines in North Alabama, but when he demanded a return to action, General Braxton Bragg created an infantry brigade for him to command in the Army of Tennessee. He took part in the Tullahoma Campaign, and saw action at the Battle of Hoover&#x27;s Gap in June 1863. During this period, Tennessee&#x27;s Confederate leaders offered Bate the gubernatorial nomination to replace term-limited governor Isham G. Harris, but Bate declined, preferring to stay on the frontlines.

At the Battle of Chickamauga, Bate engaged in a skirmish with enemy forces that opened the fighting on the evening of September 18, 1863. In the intense fighting that took place on the following day, three of his horses were shot out from under him. During the reorganization of the Army of Tennessee after this battle, Bate was given command of John C. Breckinridge&#x27;s division (Breckinridge had been promoted to Corps commander). Bate commanded this division at the Battle of Missionary Ridge in November 1863.

As a result of his service in the Chattanooga Campaign, Bate was promoted to major general on February 24, 1864. That summer, his division took part in the Atlanta Campaign, and saw action at the battles of Resaca, New Hope Church, Kennesaw Mountain, and Peachtree Creek, as well as the main Battle of Atlanta on July 22. At the Battle of Utoy Creek on August 6, Bate used a deception plan that foiled the main Union attack. He was shot in the knee in a skirmish at Willis&#x27; Grist Mill near Atlanta on August 10, and was bedridden in Barnesville, Georgia, for several weeks.

Bate rejoined his division in time to take part in General John B. Hood&#x27;s invasion of Tennessee in late 1864. At the Battle of Franklin on November 30, he lost nearly 20% of his division, and his horse was again shot out from under him. He commanded General Benjamin F. Cheatham&#x27;s right flank at the Battle of Nashville two weeks later.

Bate&#x27;s division remained with Cheatham&#x27;s Corps during the 1865 Carolinas Campaign, during which he saw action at the Battle of Bentonville in March. Bate and his men surrendered at Bennett Place near Greensboro, North Carolina. During the war, he was wounded three times and had six horses shot and killed beneath him.

==After the Civil War==
After the war, Bate practiced law in Nashville in partnership with Colonel Frank Williams. He remained active in politics, serving on the State Democratic Committee and the National Democratic Executive Committee in the late 1860s. He was nominated for the U.S. Senate in 1875, 1877, and 1881, and was an elector for presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden in 1876.

Throughout the 1870s and early 1880s, Tennessee&#x27;s state government struggled with debt, which had accumulated over previous decades as the state issued bonds to fund internal improvements and railroad construction. The Panic of 1873 decimated the state&#x27;s property tax revenue, and the state defaulted on its bond debt in 1875. By the early 1880s, the state Democratic Party had split into two factions over how to resolve the crisis: those who sought full repayment of the debt at all costs to preserve the state&#x27;s credit (known as the &quot;high tax&quot; or &quot;state credit&quot; Democrats) and those who believed full payment unfeasible and sought only a partial payment (known as the &quot;low tax&quot; Democrats). In the gubernatorial race of 1880, each faction nominated its own candidate, causing the Democratic vote to be split, and allowing Republican Alvin Hawkins to win the election.

==Governor==

In the 1882 gubernatorial race, the state&#x27;s Bourbon faction, led by former governor Isham Harris, rallied support for the &quot;low tax&quot; faction, which nominated Bate as its candidate. Bate proposed paying 50% on bonds held by railroads (some of which were believed to have been obtained fraudulently during the Brownlow administration), and making full payment on bonds held by schools, charities, and Sarah Childress Polk, the widow of the late President James K. Polk. The &quot;high tax&quot; Democrats nominated their own candidate, Joseph Fussell. On election day, Bate won with 120,637 votes to 93,168 for the incumbent, Hawkins, 9,660 for Greenback candidate John Beasley, and 4,814 for Fussell.

After his inauguration, Bate signed his debt plan into law, finally resolving the debt issue that had dogged the state for over a decade. There was still considerable anger over how the crisis was resolved, however, which threatened Bate&#x27;s reelection chances in 1884. The Republican candidate, Nashville judge Frank T. Reid, mounted a strong campaign, but Bate won reelection by a vote of 132,201 to 125,246.

During his first term, Bate signed into a law an act creating the State Railroad Commission to regulate railroad rates. Farmers, who deemed railroad freight rates too high, supported this, while railroad companies opposed it. The act creating this commission was repealed in 1885, however, angering farmers, and damaging Democrats&#x27; chances of holding onto the governor&#x27;s office in the 1886 election.

==Later life==
After Senator Howell Jackson resigned in 1886, Bate appointed Washington C. Whitthorne to complete his term, which was set to expire in March 1887. The Tennessee General Assembly elected Bate to fill this Senate seat. He was reelected in 1893, 1899, and 1905. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the Committee on the Improvement of the Mississippi River and Its Tributaries in the 53rd Congress, and the chairman of the Committee on Public Health and the National Quarantine in two later sessions. He supported lower taxes, and favored funding for common schools, the United States Weather Bureau, and the Army Signal Corps. He voted for the admission of Oklahoma, Arizona, and New Mexico as states.

Shortly after being elected to his fourth term, Bate attended the inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt on March 4, 1905. He was believed to have caught a cold but died of pneumonia a few days later on March 9. His body was returned to Nashville on a specially chartered train, and he was interred in Mount Olivet Cemetery there. Members of the Frank Cheatham Bivouac, which consisted of surviving Confederate veterans, fired the final salute over his grave.

==Personal life==

Bate married Julia Peete, the daughter of Samuel Peete, a prominent lawyer and scholar of Huntsville, Alabama. She was born in Huntsville and educated in the schools of Alabama and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her marriage to Hon. William B. Bate took place in 1856. During the two successive terms that her husband was Governor of Tennessee, Mrs. Bate presided with grace and dignity over the State Executive Mansion.

In 1889, Bate was elected to the United States Senate, and she accompanied him to Washington. She usually resided there during the sessions of Congress, participating in the social affairs incident to Senatorial life. They had four daughters, two of whom lived to adulthood: Mrs. Thomas F. Mastin, Texas, and Susie, Mrs. O. D. Childs, Los Angeles. Susie Bate had been a much admired young lady in Washington society for several seasons. Mrs Bate was a member of the Methodist church and of several charitable organizations.

Bate&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Colonel Humphrey Bate (1779–1856), was an early settler in Sumner County. Governor Bate&#x27;s middle name was the surname of his paternal grandmother (Colonel Humphrey Bate&#x27;s first wife), Elizabeth Brimage. After the death of Elizabeth Brimage, Colonel Humphrey Bate married Anna Weatherred, sister of Governor Bate&#x27;s mother, Amanda. Several of Governor Bate&#x27;s relatives, including his brother, Captain Humphrey Bate (1828–1862), were killed or wounded at the Battle of Shiloh.

Dr. Humphrey Bate (1875–1936), a cousin of Governor Bate, was a noted harmonica player and string band leader. He was one of the first musicians to perform at the Grand Ole Opry in the 1920s.

<doc id="907819" wikidata="Q3777257" url="?curid=907819" title="Basic norm">
<text> () is a concept in the &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; created by Hans Kelsen, a jurist and legal philosopher. Kelsen used this word to denote the basic norm, order, or rule that forms an underlying basis for a legal system. The theory is based on a need to find a point of origin for all law, on which basic law and the constitution can gain their legitimacy (akin to the concept of first principles). This basic norm, however, is often described as hypothetical. 

Reaction to the term has fallen into three broad areas including (i) Kelsen&#x27;s original introduction of the term, (ii) the Neo-Kantian reception of the term by Kelsen&#x27;s critics and followers, and (iii) the hypothetical and symbolic use of the term through the history of its application.

==Origins==

Regarding Kelsen&#x27;s original use of the term, its closest antecedent appears in writings of his colleague Adolf Merkl at the University of Vienna. Merkl was developing a structural research approach for the understanding of law as a matter of the hierarchical relationship of norms, largely on the basis of their being either superior or inferior to each other. Kelsen adapted and assimilated much of Merkl&#x27;s approach into his own presentation of the &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; in both its original version and its revised version. For Kelsen, the importance of the basic norm was in large measure twofold since it importantly indicated the logical recursion of superior relationships between norms as they led to the norm that ultimately would have no other norm to which it was inferior. Its second feature was that it represented the importance that Kelsen associated with the concept of a fully centralized legal order in contrast to the existence of decentralized forms of government and legal orders.

==Responses and interpretations==

===Neo-Kantian===

The second form of the reception of the term originated from the fairly extended attempt to read Kelsen as a Neo-Kantian following his early exchange with Hermann Cohen in 1913 concerning the publication of Kelsen&#x27;s habilitation dissertation in 1911 on public law. Cohen was a leading Neo-Kantian and Kelsen was, in his own way, receptive to many of the ideas that Cohen had expressed in his published book review of Kelsen&#x27;s writing. Kelsen had insisted that he had never used this material in the actual writing of his own book, though Cohen&#x27;s ideas were attractive to him in their own right. This has resulted in one of the longest-running debates within the general Kelsen community as to whether Kelsen became a Neo-Kantian himself after the encounter with Cohen, or whether he managed to keep his own non-Neo-Kantian position intact, which he claimed was the prevailing circumstance when he first wrote his book in 1911.

The Neo-Kantians, when pressing the issue, would lead Kelsen into discussions concerning whether the existence of such a &quot;Grundnorm&quot; was strictly symbolic or whether it had a concrete foundation. This has led to the further division within this debate concerning the currency of the term &quot;Grundnorm&quot; as to whether it should be read, on the one hand, as part and parcel of Hans Vaihinger&#x27;s &quot;as-if&quot; hypothetical construction. On the other hand, to those seeking a practical reading, the &quot;Grundnorm&quot; corresponded to something directly and concretely comparable to a sovereign nation&#x27;s federal constitution, under which would be organized all or its regional and local laws, and no law would be recognized as being superior to it.

===Symbolic===
In different contexts, Kelsen would indicate his preferences in different ways, with some Neo-Kantians asserting that late in life Kelsen would largely abide by the symbolic reading of the term when used in the Neo-Kantian context, and as he has documented. The Neo-Kantian reading of Kelsen can further be subdivided into three subgroups, with each representing their own preferred reading of the meaning of the &#x27;Grundnorm,&#x27; which were identifiable as (a) the Marburg Neo-Kantians, (b) the Baden-Baden Neo-Kantians, and (c) his own Kelsenian reading of the Neo-Kantian school with which his writings on this subject are often associated, as found in his response to the Cohen exchange circa 1911-1914.

===Hart and others===
This has led to criticism from noted authors such as H. L. A. Hart, who refers to the theory as a &#x27;needless duplication&#x27; of the &#x27;living reality&#x27; of the courts and officials actually identifying the law in accordance with the constitution&#x27;s rules. It is mystifying to posit a rule beyond these rules, which adds, superfluously in Hart&#x27;s view, that the constitution is to be obeyed.

Kelsen also attempted to explain international law by the concept of a Grundnorm superior to all the Grundnorms of the state. This theory has been severely criticised by theorists like Hart and Lord Lloyd, though others, such as followers of various schools of the future development of the United Nations, including Grenville Clark and Louis B. Sohn of Harvard, who have strongly endorsed it.

<text>Un Pingüino en mi Ascensor (&quot;A Penguin in my Elevator&quot; in Spanish) is a Spanish music band.

The band was formed in the 80s by the attorney José Luis Moro, the singer and composer of the songs. Mario Gil (La Mode and Aviador Dro) produced some of the records, elevating the overall quality of the songs. 

The musical style of the compositions is deliberately cheesy and corny, which contrasts with the lyrics, which use black humor, sarcasm and irony in a way that it only makes sense in the &quot;everything is valid&quot;, Punk rock creative impulse of &quot;La movida&quot; in Madrid during the 1980s.

<text>Great Books of the Western World is a series of books originally published in the United States in 1952, by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., to present the great books in 54 volumes.

The original editors had three criteria for including a book in the series drawn from Western Civilization: the book must be relevant to contemporary matters, and not only important in its historical context; it must be rewarding to re-read repeatedly with respect to liberal education; and it must be a part of &quot;the great conversation about the great ideas&quot;, relevant to at least 25 of the 102 &quot;Great Ideas&quot; as identified by the editor of the series&#x27;s comprehensive index, the &quot;Syntopicon&quot;, to which they belonged. The books were chosen not on the basis of ethnic and cultural inclusiveness (historical influence being seen as sufficient for inclusion), nor on whether the editors agreed with the authors&#x27; views.

A second edition was published in 1990, in 60 volumes. Some translations were updated; some works were removed; and there were additions from the 20th century, in six new volumes.
==History==
The project for the &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; began at the University of Chicago, where the president, Robert Hutchins, worked with Mortimer Adler to develop there a course of a type originated by John Erskine at Columbia University in 1921, with the innovation of a &quot;round table&quot; approach to reading and discussing great books among professors and undergraduates.—generally aimed at businessmen. The purposes they had in mind were for filling the gaps in their liberal education (including Hutchins&#x27; own, self-confessed gaps) and to render the reader an intellectually rounded man or woman familiar with the Great Books of the Western canon and knowledgeable of the Great Ideas visited in the &quot;Great Conversation&quot; over the course of three millennia.

An original student of the project was William Benton, who at the time was the chief executive officer of the Encyclopædia Britannica publishing company and later was a United States senator. In 1943, he proposed selecting the greatest books of the Western canon, and that Hutchins and Adler produce unabridged editions for publication by Encyclopædia Britannica. Hutchins was wary at first, fearing that commodifying the books would devalue them as cultural artifacts; but he agreed to the business deal and was paid $60,000 for his work on the project. Benton at first refused the deal on the basis that the set of works selected would be just that, artifacts, never to be read.

By chance, Adler was re-reading a source he was using for a book he was writing at the time, &quot;How to Think about War and Peace&quot;. He noted to the person who had provided the book for him that he had missed the instructive passage that this person was pointing out to him and wondered why that had happened. They realized that Adler had read the book focusing on one idea about war and peace. Adler struck on the idea of making an index for the whole set for Hutchins, so that readers could have &quot;random access&quot; to the works, with the desired result that they would develop a greater interest in the works.

===Failure to come to terms===

After deciding what subjects and authors to include, and how to present the materials, the indexing part of the project was begun, with a budget of another $60,000. Adler began compiling what his group called the &quot;Greek index&quot; bearing on the works selected from ancient Greece, expecting completion of the entire project within six months. After two years, the Greek index was declared to be a resounding failure. The inferior terms under the Great Ideas across the centuries in which the Greek-language works were written had shifted in their significance, and the preliminary index reflected that, the ideas presented not having &quot;come to terms&quot; with each other.

During those times, Adler had a flash of insight. He set his group re-reading each work preliminarily with a single assigned subordinate idea in mind in the form of a fairly elaborate phrase. If any instances of the idea appeared, they could collate them with co-ordinate ideas of a similar type collected the same way, use the material thus noted to better re-frame the larger idea structure and then finally start re-reading the work in its entirety with revised phrasing to do the complete indexing, of &quot;ideas&quot;.

===Eventual popular success===

In 1945, Adler began writing the initial forms of the essays for the Great Ideas and six years and $940,000 more later, on April 15, 1952, the &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; were presented at a publication party in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, in New York City. In his speech, Hutchins said, &quot;This is more than a set of books, and more than a liberal education. &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; is an act of piety. Here are the sources of our being. Here is our heritage. This is the West. This is its meaning for mankind.&quot; The first two sets of books were given to Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, and to Harry S. Truman, the incumbent U.S. President. Adler appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine for a story about the set of works and its idea index and inventory of Western topics of thought at large, of sorts.

The initial sales of the book sets were poor, with only 1,863 sets sold in 1952, and less than one-tenth of that number of book sets were sold in 1953. A financial debacle loomed until Encyclopædia Britannica altered the sales strategy, and sold the book set through experienced door-to-door encyclopædia-salesmen, as Hutchins had feared; but, through that method, 50,000 sets were sold in 1961. In 1963 the editors published &quot;Gateway to the Great Books&quot;, a ten-volume set of readings meant to introduce the authors and the subjects of the &quot;Great Books&quot;. Each year, from 1961 to 1998, the editors published &quot;The Great Ideas Today&quot;, an annual updating about the applicability of the &quot;Great Books&quot; to contemporary life. According to Alex Beam, &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; eventually sold a million sets. The Internet and the E-book reader have made available some of the &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; in an on-line format.

==Volumes==
Originally published in 54 volumes, &quot;The Great Books of the Western World&quot; covers categories including fiction, history, poetry, natural science, mathematics, philosophy, drama, politics, religion, economics, and ethics. Hutchins wrote the first volume, titled &quot;The Great Conversation&quot;, as an introduction and discourse on liberal education. Adler sponsored the next two volumes, &quot;The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon&quot;, as a way of emphasizing the unity of the set and, by extension, of Western thought in general. A team of indexers spent months compiling references to such topics as &quot;Man&#x27;s freedom in relation to the will of God&quot; and &quot;The denial of void or vacuum in favor of a plenum&quot;. They grouped the topics into 102 chapters, for which Adler wrote the 102 introductions. Four colors identify each volume by subject area—Imaginative Literature, Mathematics and the Natural Sciences, History and Social Science, and Philosophy and Theology. 

The following list of Volumes 1 - 54 is for the first edition (1952). The second edition (1990) omitted &quot;The Great Conversation&quot; by the first editor-in-chief, Robert Maynard Hutchins. Because of this, a number of the volumes of the second edition are numbered one less than they are in the first (e.g., Homer is Volume 4 of the first edition but Volume 3 in the second, and so on). This is of interest because Volumes 3 - 54 are numbered in historical order of the first included author&#x27;s lifetime, which may lead to some confusion for novice readers when, for example, a 17th century writer (Kepler) is included in the same volume as Ptolemy (2d century AD). 

With one exception, Volumes 3 - 54 are labelled with all of the included authors listed on the spine. Volumes 40 and 55 - 60 (second edition) are labelled by subject matter (eg. volume 57 is called &quot;20th Century Social Sciences I&quot;). 

The inside covers of volumes 3-60 display useful parallel timelines of all the authors lifespans entitled &quot;Chronology of the Great Authors. The timeline is divided into three eras: Ancient Greece and Rome; The Middle Ages Through the Eighteenth Century; The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries.

==Second edition==
The second edition of &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot;, 1990, saw an increase from 54 to 60 volumes, with updated translations. The six new volumes concerned the 20th century, an era of which the first edition&#x27;s sole representative was Freud. Some of the other volumes were re-arranged, with even more pre-20th century material added but with four texts deleted: Apollonius&#x27; &quot;On Conic Sections&quot;, Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, and Joseph Fourier&#x27;s &quot;Analytical Theory of Heat&quot;. Adler later expressed regret about dropping &quot;On Conic Sections&quot; and &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. Adler also voiced disagreement with the addition of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;, and said that the Syntopicon should have included references to the Koran. He addressed criticisms that the set was too heavily Western European and did not adequately represent women and minority authors. Four women authors were included, where previously there were none.

The added pre-20th century texts appear in these volumes (some of the accompanying content of these volumes differs from the first edition volume of that number):

==Criticisms and responses==

===Authors===
The choice of authors has come under attack, with some dismissing the project as a celebration of European men, ignoring contributions of women and non-European authors. The criticism swelled in tandem with the feminist and civil rights movements. Similarly, in his &quot;&quot;, Norman Davies criticizes the compilation for overrepresenting selected parts of the western world, especially Britain and the U.S., while ignoring the other, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. According to his calculation, in 151 authors included in both editions, there are 49 English or American authors, 27 Frenchmen, 20 Germans, 15 ancient Greeks, 9 ancient Romans, 4 Russians, 4 Scandinavians, 3 Spaniards, 3 Italians, 3 Irishmen, 3 Scots, and 3 Eastern Europeans. Prejudices and preferences, he concludes, are self-evident.

In response, such criticisms have been derided as &quot;ad hominem&quot; and biased in themselves. The counter-argument maintains that such criticisms discount the importance of books solely because of generic, imprecise and possibly irrelevant characteristics of the books&#x27; authors, rather than because of the content of the books themselves.

===Works===
Others thought that while the selected authors were worthy, too much emphasis was placed on the complete works of a single author rather than a wider selection of authors and representative works. For instance, two volumes each are reserved for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, William Shakespeare and Edward Gibbon. The second edition of the set already contained 130 authors and 517 individual works. The editors point out that the guides to additional reading for each topic in the &quot;Syntopicon&quot; refer the interested reader to many more authors.

===Difficulty===
The scientific and mathematical selections came under criticism for being incomprehensible to the average reader, especially with the absence of any sort of critical apparatus. The second edition did drop two scientific works, by Apollonius and Fourier, in part because of their perceived difficulty for the average reader. Nevertheless, the editors steadfastly maintain that average readers are capable of understanding far more than the critics deem possible. Robert Hutchins stated this view in the introduction to the first edition:

:Because the great bulk of mankind have never had the chance to get a liberal education, it cannot be &quot;proved&quot; that they can get it. Neither can it be &quot;proved&quot; that they cannot. The statement of the ideal, however, is of value in indicating the direction that education should take.

===Rationale===
Since the great majority of the works were still in print, one critic remarked that the company could have saved two million dollars and simply written a list. Dense formatting also did not help readability. Nonetheless, Encyclopædia Britannica&#x27;s aggressive promotion produced solid sales.

The second edition selected translations that were generally considered an improvement, though the cramped typography remained. Through reading plans and the &quot;Syntopicon&quot;, the editors attempted to guide readers through the set.

===Response to criticisms===

The editors responded that the set contains wide-ranging debates representing many viewpoints on significant issues, not a monolithic school of thought. Mortimer Adler argued in the introduction to the second edition:

:Presenting a wide variety and divergence of views or opinions, among which there is likely to be some truth but also much more error, the &quot;Syntopicon&quot; [and by extension the larger set itself] invites readers to think for themselves and make up their own minds on every topic under consideration.

<text>Pollokshields (, Scots: &quot;Powkshiels&quot;) is an area in the Southside of Glasgow, Scotland. Its modern boundaries are largely man-made, being formed by the M77 motorway to the west and northwest with the open land of Pollok Country Park and the Dumbreck neighbourhood beyond, by the Inverclyde Line railway and other branches which separate its territory from the largely industrial areas of Kinning Park, Kingston and Port Eglinton, and by the Glasgow South Western Line running from the east to south, bordering Govanhill, Strathbungo, Crossmyloof and Shawlands residential areas. There is also a suburban railway running through the area.

Pollokshields is a conservation area which was developed in Victorian times according to a plan promoted by the original landowners, the Stirling-Maxwells of Pollok, whose association with the area goes as far back as 1270. The core of the area was constructed in two distinct and contrasting styles, with the western part consisting mainly of large villas with gardens along sweeping, undulating tree-lined boulevards, whereas the eastern part (once a separate burgh) is formed by three-storey sandstone tenements typical of many parts of the city from the era, arranged in a tight grid of streets on relatively flat ground.

==History==
Pollokshields was established by the Stirling-Maxwell family in 1849, and was set out or &#x27;feued&#x27; by the Edinburgh architect David Rhind. Many well-known Glaswegian architects contributed to its development, and it contains villas by Alexander &#x27;Greek&#x27; Thomson among others. There are several contributions by contemporaries of Charles Rennie Mackintosh including a series of good &#x27;Glasgow style&#x27; tenements by the architect Harry Clifford, who was also responsible for the &#x27;A&#x27; listed Pollokshields Burgh Hall, in Scottish Baronial style. The building was inaugurated in 1890 along with the adjoining Maxwell Park, the land for which was given by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell of Nether Pollok in 1888.
Such was its early population growth, Pollokshields attained &#x27;burgh&#x27; status in 1876. However, this ended in 1891 when, after being offered favourable tax terms, the residents of the burgh agreed for it to become a suburb of the growing city of Glasgow. The Victorian and Edwardian architecture and the parks of this area have remained almost untouched, leaving the feeling of a leafy Victorian suburb, while being well within the city.

In March 2004, local white youth Kriss Donald was abducted from Kenmure Street in Pollokshields, then tortured and murdered in a racially motivated attack. Five men of Pakistani descent, also from Pollokshields, were later jailed for the crime, four receiving life sentences. The case drew attention to the issue of Asian gang culture and associated crime and violence in the area.

In May 2021, residents came out to protest an attempt from the Home Office to detain two men living on Kenmure Street. Hundreds of people surrounded the van in the street to prevent it from moving, with one man lying under the van for nine hours until it was confirmed that the detainees were to be released. With the help of a lawyer and politicians, including Nicola Sturgeon who discussed it with the UK Home Office, the men were released to the local mosque and allowed back into their homes. The protest led to significant news coverage.

The area was subject to local youths causing disorder relating to fireworks in the period around Bonfire Night (5 November), to the extent that council approval was granted in 2024 for a Fireworks Control Zone (FCZ) to be issued prohibiting their use (the first of its kind in Glasgow); however, the deadline for submission of the relevant paperwork was missed. Although some explosives were seized by police and efforts made to clear streets of flammable debris, more widespread disorder was seen that year, including a car being set alight, rockets being fired at moving vehicles and the setting of a bonfire in the middle of Albert Drive which burned for several hours and had fireworks added to it periodically which exploded at random in the direction of residential homes.

==Education==
In and around Pollokshields are four primary schools (Pollokshields Primary on Albert Drive; Glendale Primary and Glendale Gaelic School on a shared campus located on the south edge of Pollokshields; and St Albert&#x27;s Primary on Maxwell Drive) and three secondary schools (Bellahouston Academy, located on the western edge of Pollokshields at the M77 motorway; Shawlands Academy in the Shawlands area approximately a mile south of Pollokshields; and Hutchesons Grammar School, a private school with its senior campus in Pollokshields and its junior and pre-school campus nearby). Craigholme School, another private institution with buildings on Nithsdale Road and St Andrews Drive, closed in 2020.

==Demographics==

Pollokshields had a total population of 27,983 as of 2015, however this referred to the wider council ward encompassing several other neighbourhoods (Crossmyloof, Craigton, Strathbungo and parts of Shawlands).

The population is culturally diverse, with a significant Pakistani population.

==Architecture==

The architecture in Pollokshields is predominantly a mixture of Victorian tenements and large detached and semi-detached properties dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the more significant residential developments outwith this style is a group of seven 1960s brutalist eight-storey cube-shaped blocks on either side of St Andrew&#x27;s Drive (west of Shields Road) and an L-shaped complex of contemporary deck-access flats, managed by the Southside Housing Association and refurbished in the 2010s. At that time most of a larger deck-access complex on the south side of the road constructed in two adjoining &#x27;T&#x27; shapes was demolished in stages to be replaced by new properties.
The Church of St Albert the Great in Pollokshields was originally built for a congregation of the United Presbyterian Church. The Italian Renaissance design by John B. Wilson was also used in another building, Stockwell Free Church, in 1887. St Albert&#x27;s original title was Albert Road Church, after Queen Victoria&#x27;s consort, Prince Albert, rather than the German saint of the same name who is the current patron. The Archdiocese of Glasgow acquired the church in 1965 for the new parish and with minimal interference to the original interior or exterior design, it was brought back into use as a church in 1967. The cream sandstone facade has a very attractive octagonal vestibule and tall bell tower. St Ninian&#x27;s church is part of the Scottish Episcopal Church located on the corner of Albert Drive and Pollokshaws Road.

Pollokshields Parish Church of the Church of Scotland was built as Pollokshields Established Church by Robert Baldie in 1877–1878. The architecture is mixed Gothic with an early English tower with tabernacles above the broaches of the spire at the southwest comer of the building. The tower has a clock face on each of its four sides. The south (entrance) front has a large geometrical window above a row of trefoil-headed windows with stiff leaf capitals. The side aisles have twin lancet windows beneath the clerestory of triple lancet windows to the main church. The interior has aisle arcades formed by polished granite columns on high octagonal sandstone bases with French Gothic capitals supporting pointed arches beneath the clerestory windows and the high scissor-braced roof trusses. Each column cap is different. The timber roof of the side aisles and the main trusses add to the grandeur of the interior. The south balcony is reached by a staircase from the east porch. The deep chancel was remodelled in 1912–1914 with new organ, pulpit and communion table.

Sherbrooke St. Gilbert&#x27;s Church is another Church of Scotland congregation. The church was built in 1894 and had to be rebuilt following a serious fire in 1994. It is located on Nithsdale Road, close to Dumbreck railway station.

===Burgh Hall===

Pollokshields Burgh Hall was designed by Harry Clifford during the Scottish Renaissance in the late 19th century and is currently listed as a significant building of Pollokshields. Built in Ballochmyle Red Freestone, it was opened in 1890 by Sir John Stirling Maxwell, whose coat of arms is depicted in the entrance porch in the stone of the Hall and is recorded in marble in the floor. At one end of the building there is a high tower with a balcony. Throughout the building there are detailed stained-glass windows from the town of Pollokshields. The lodge house adjacent comprises two flats; the Sanitary Inspector and the Park Gardener used these facilities as living accommodation, and they are currently privately let by the Burgh Hall trust. In 1891 the Burgh Hall passed into the hands of Glasgow Council when the city extended its boundaries. In 1938 the back of the building was enlarged; this meant that the last gallery in the spacious hall had to be sacrificed in order to permit the building of the extension.

By 1975 it was being used by the Social Work Department of Strathclyde Regional Council as an occupational day centre. In 1982 a decision was taken to sell it on the open market. This proved controversial—the residents of Pollokshields protested due to its connection to the heritage of the town and the historical significance to the area. Further protests ensued, so a charitable trust was formed to ensure that the building would continue to be publicly owned. The Trust acquired the building for £1 in 1986. Only in 1991 was the title transferred, with the condition that the derelict lodge house be restored within five years. Historic Scotland supported the heritage campaign, as well as other organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, Glasgow City Council, and the Glasgow Development Agency. The lodge house and the ground floor of the Hall were completely refurbished and reopened around 1997. The lower ground floor has since attracted further funding and what was once little more than cellar space has been converted to a contemporary conference room, which can be directly accessed from the outside.

==Sports==
Clydesdale Cricket Club is located at Titwood on the periphery of Pollokshields. Founded in Kinning Park in 1848 by Archibald Campbell, it was formed by members of two previous clubs which played on Glasgow Green, to cater for the burgeoning residential developments south of the river Clyde. It is now the oldest surviving team sports club in Glasgow. On moving to Pollokshields in 1873, the club sold its previous grounds in Kinning Park to a newly founded football club called Rangers. At that time, the club also fielded a football team, Clydesdale, which were runners-up to Queen&#x27;s Park in the first Scottish Cup final in 1874, after many associated with the club had been instrumental in the foundation of the Scottish Football Association.

==Transport==
Pollokshields has three open railway stations: , and , all on the Cathcart Circle Line. on the Glasgow South Western Line and on the Paisley Canal Line are also nearby. Closed railway stations include and .

The area is also served by Shields Road subway station on the Glasgow Subway, located in a non-residential area to the north, and by numerous bus routes.

For road transport, the M8, M74, and M77 motorways all serve Pollokshields, while the A77 road runs along the eastern edge of the area.

<doc id="907831" wikidata="Q4384059" url="?curid=907831" title="William Pierce (Georgia politician)">
<text>William Leigh Pierce (1753 – December 10, 1789) was a Founding Father of the United States, military officer during the Revolutionary War, member of the Continental Congress, merchant, and planter and slave owner. As a delegate representing Georgia at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, he left before he could sign the U.S. Constitution.

==Early life==
William Leigh Pierce was born in York County, Virginia in 1753, the third and youngest son of Matthew and Elizabeth Pierce. As a young man, he studied art under Charles Willson Peale in Maryland.

==Military service==
After returning to Virginia from Maryland in the summer of 1775, Pierce accepted a commission in the Continental Army. As tensions with Great Britain turned into armed conflict, he participated in the fighting at Hampton, Virginia, in September 1775. Pierce was commissioned a Captain in the 1st Continental Regiment of Artillery the following year as the new country organized its forces for war. After months of guarding against British incursions in the Hampton Roads area, the First Regiment of Continental Artillery was ordered to join the Main Army at Valley Forge in the Spring of 1778.

After his regiment arrived at Valley Forge, Pierce&#x27;s battery was then detached to Major General John Sullivan&#x27;s command in Rhode Island. Suffering from poor health, Pierce voluntarily suspended his company command and accepted a position as an aide-de-camp to General Sullivan in early 1779. He attended his commander in the punitive expedition in Upstate New York to subdue the British-aligned Iroquois during the summer.

Returning to Williamsburg, Virginia on furlough in early 1780, Pierce evidently studied at the College of William &amp; Mary and was accepted as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. As the War for American Independence shifted to the southern states, Pierce was again invited to become an aide-de-camp to a general officer in December 1780, this time to Major General Nathanael Greene. Pierce accepted the assignment and joined his new corps on its fighting retreat in North Carolina in early February 1781.

Pierce proved himself valuable to Greene over the course of the next two years, not only in his secretarial duties but as a military officer. For example, he assisted in the rallying a contingent of Virginia troops at a critical moment during the Battle of Hobkirk Hill and was also Greene&#x27;s selection to carry news of the Battle of Eutaw Springs to the Continental Congress.

==Merchant, planter, and politician==
With the end of the war, Pierce established himself as a merchant and planter, marrying the daughter of a wealthy South Carolinian. Conditions for business were dim during the nation&#x27;s Confederation period, so Pierce sought political office with the hope of improving his prospects. He was elected to represent Chatham County in Georgia&#x27;s General Assembly on February 1, 1786. The state legislature promptly elected him to the Confederation Congress, as well as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.

In January 1787, he attended Congress in New York, the nation&#x27;s temporary capital, and in May traveled to Philadelphia for the convention. Pierce attended the proceedings and spoke on a number of points. He also recorded a series of &quot;Character Sketches&quot;, providing a narrative on the personalities of the convention&#x27;s delegates.

Although he agreed with the end result of the proceedings, Pierce did not sign the Constitution, having left at the end of June to attend to &quot;a piece of business so necessary that it became unavoidable.&quot; The business was a duel with merchant John Auldjo, after tempers had flared over mishandled &quot;mercantile dealings.&quot; Ironically, Auldjo&#x27;s second, Alexander Hamilton, intervened and prevented the contest. Returning to Georgia, Pierce continued in the state legislature and, in 1789, received a respectable number of votes for Governor.

==Death==
Pierce died at his plantation near Savannah on December 10, 1789 after a lingering illness.

At the 2013 Phillips 66 National Championships, which also served as the selection meet for the World Championships, Coughlin decided to only take up the sprint freestyles and swam the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events. Coughlin qualified for the 50-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Coughlin finished first in the 50-meter freestyle with a 24.97, just ahead of 16-year-old Simone Manuel, who swam a 25.01. With the first-place finish in the 50-meter freestyle, Coughlin ensured herself a relay spot since she had finished 5th in the 100-meter freestyle, with a time of 54.04.

She won a gold medal at the event on the first night of swimming competition in the 4×100 freestyle relay. She went second for team USA and swam her leg in 52.98 seconds; she was one of 6 women in the field of 32 to break the 53-second barrier.

In her final triumph, two months before her 33rd birthday in 2015, she set an American record of 27.51 seconds in the 50-meter backstroke.

==Post-swimming career and media appearances==

Coughlin was the spokeswoman for C20 Coconut Water.

One of Coughlin&#x27;s favorite hobbies is cooking. During the 2008 Summer Olympics, she was invited to prepare a Chinese-themed dish on &quot;Today&quot;. She has appeared as a judge on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;. She appeared on Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Chopped&quot; Sport Stars episode that first aired on September 3, 2013.

Coughlin appeared in the 2012 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue. She has also written a book called &quot;Golden Girl&quot;.

In 2013, Coughlin appeared in &quot;Chopped&quot; where she lost in the final round to Danica Patrick. While on the show she mentioned she grows a vegetable and herb garden in her backyard, as well as raising backyard chickens.

Coughlin appeared on one of the covers for the 2015 &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; &quot;The Body Issue&quot; and in July/August 2016, the cover of &quot;Self&quot;&#x27;s Olympics themed issue.

Also in 2015, Coughlin became a brand ambassador and investor in a frozen food company, Luvo Inc.

In 2017, she became a partner in Gaderian Wines, a winemaking operation in Napa Valley.

In 2021, Coughlin was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Knocklyon () is a suburb of the city of Dublin, located in South Dublin, Ireland. Unlike many Dublin suburbs, Knocklyon was not developed around a village; rather it largely consists of modern housing, with a number of old cottages and farmhouses along Knocklyon Road attesting to the area&#x27;s rural past.

== Etymology ==
The area has been known historically in 14th-century scrolls as &quot;Cnoclín&quot;, literally &#x27;flax mountain&#x27;. Until recently, roadsigns in Knocklyon had an incorrect &quot;reverse anglicised&quot; translation, giving &quot;Lyon&#x27;s hill&quot; or &quot;Cnoc Liamhna&quot;, so for example, the Irish-language wording on signs for Knocklyon Road showed &quot;Bóthar Chnoc Liamhna&quot;. The local authority have updated their translation based on recommendations from the Irish Placenames Commission.

== Location and housing estates ==
Knocklyon is located among the southwestern suburbs of the city of Dublin, in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains and immediately south of the line of the River Dodder. It is bordered to the west by Firhouse and Ballycullen, to the east and south by Rathfarnham and Ballyboden, and to the north, across the River Dodder, by the village and district of Templeogue.

Knocklyon was divided when the M50 motorway was constructed, with most of the suburb today lying east of the motorway. Housing estates to the east include Idrone, Knocklyon Avenue, Beverly, Dargle Wood, Coolamber, Knockcullen, Lansdowne, Delaford, Knockaire in the old Knocklyon townland, whilst Orlagh, Scholarstown Park and Templeoran are within the townland of Scholarstown. To the west of the M50 are estates such as Castlefield, Glenlyon, Dalriada, Glenvara and Woodstown. The western and eastern portions of the suburb are linked by the Firhouse Road, by the motorway flyover at Junction 12 of the M50, and by a footbridge close to where the Old Knocklyon Road formerly met Ballycullen Road.

== Population ==
The population figure cannot be isolated from published census data as Knocklyon is composed of Firhouse-Knocklyon electoral division (ED) (population 39,602 in 2011), plus fractions of Ballyboden ED (57,085) and Firhouse-Ballycullen ED (77,773), not divided and published distinctly.

== Amenities ==

Knocklyon Shopping Centre contains a supermarket and other retail outlets. There are also two smaller shopping sites, in the Orlagh and Woodstown estates, each anchored by a convenience store, and with takeaway food shops, beauty salons and other outlets. There is also a local public house.

A division of the voluntary St. John Ambulance was established in 2010, and provides first aid training in the community. The Rutland Centre, a private addiction rehabilitation facility, is located on the Knocklyon Road.

Knocklyon has a number of open spaces within its residential estates and along the River Dodder, including the home ground and playing pitches for both a Gaelic Athletic Association club, Ballyboden St. Enda&#x27;s GAA, and a soccer club, Knocklyon United Football Club. 

As well as the Roman Catholic &quot;Iona Centre&quot;, which hosts community organisations, there is Knocklyon Community Centre, which is available for sports and social organisations. 

=== Schools ===

St. Colmcille&#x27;s national school opened in September 1976. The school is the largest primary school in Ireland and one of the largest primary schools in Europe. It educates 1,600 students and employs 80 teachers, 23 special needs assistants, and 11 ancillary staff. Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna is an Irish language primary school that teaches over 200 children. It was established in September 1996 with 36 pupils.

St. Colmcille&#x27;s Community School (formerly Knocklyon Community School) has around 700 secondary students and opened in September 2000.

== Religion ==
The Catholic Parish of Knocklyon was established in October 1974 under the patronage of Saint Colmcille. It forms part of the Dublin Archdiocese and was delegated by it to the Carmelite Order until 2022, and since 2023, is in the care of the Divine Word Missionaries. The parish church opened in April 1980, with the Iona Pastoral Centre formally opened in 2000. The Iona Centre hosts prayer groups and social activities (such as pilates, mother and baby groups, knitting and bridge), as well as a chapter of St Vincent de Paul, AA Meetings and GROW Mental Health Movement. The Catholic parish publishes the Knocklyon News magazine, which has been in continuous publication since 1982 and includes article from the wide and varied community groups of Knocklyon, as well as faith-based content, and news from the parish and the diocese. The Knocklyon News is published 3 - 4 times per year, and has a print run of 5,000. 

Residents in Knocklyon, who are members of Church of Ireland, attend Rathfarnham Parish Church. The Knocklyon Church of Christ is an autonomous Christian congregation with premises on Knocklyon Road, near Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna.

== Transport ==
Knocklyon is served by the following Dublin Bus routes: 15, 49, 65b, S6 and S8. 

== Sport and leisure ==
The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is represented in Knocklyon by Ballyboden St. Enda&#x27;s GAA Club while soccer is organised locally by Knocklyon United F.C. The local Brothers Pearse Athletics Club was founded in 1956. The district is also served by Knocklyon Junior Badminton Club and Knocklyon Social Badminton, which operate out of the Knocklyon Community Centre.

A branch of Scouting Ireland and the South Dublin Model Railway Club each operate from their own premises. There is also a brass band and music school, the Knocklyon Concert Band, operating for over 20 years. 

Local businesses and community groups are supported and promoted by Knocklyon Network, an active networking organisation.

<text>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) coordinates the United States National Cancer Program and is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is one of eleven agencies that are part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NCI conducts and supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other activities related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; the supportive care of cancer patients and their families; and cancer survivorship.

NCI is the oldest and has the largest budget and research program of the 27 institutes and centers of the NIH ($6.9 billion in 2020). It fulfills the majority of its mission via an extramural program that provides grants for cancer research. Additionally, the National Cancer Institute has intramural research programs in Bethesda, Maryland, and at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. The NCI receives more than in funding each year.

The NCI supports a nationwide network of 72 NCI-designated Cancer Centers with a dedicated focus on cancer research and treatment and maintains the National Clinical Trials Network.

== History ==
=== Timeline ===


* August 5, 1937: President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the National Cancer Institute Act (Pub. Law 75-244; 50 Stat. 559), which established the National Cancer Institute, as a division of the Public Health Service.
* 1940: The first issue of the &quot;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&quot; was published.
* 1944: The United States Congress made the NCI an operating division of the National Institutes of Health by its passage of the Public Health Service Act. Congress later amended the Public Health Service Act with the National Cancer Act of 1971, to broaden the scope and responsibilities of the NCI &quot;in order more effectively to carry out the national effort against cancer.&quot;
* 1955: NCI established the Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program, which included several research networks that conducted cancer clinical research primarily under the sponsorship of NCI.
* 1957: The first cancer, choriocarcinoma, was cured with chemotherapy at NCI.
* 1960: NCI began funding government-supported cancer centers.
* 1971: President Richard Nixon converted the U.S. Army&#x27;s former biological warfare facilities at Fort Detrick, Maryland, to house research activities on the causes, treatment, and prevention of cancer.
* 1971: The National Cancer Act of 1971 declares &quot;war on cancer,&quot; establishes the National Cancer Advisory Board, and allots additional funding for cancer research.
* 1975: The Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research opened in Frederick, Maryland, as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center
* 1993: The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 encourages NCI to expand its efforts in prostate cancer, breast and other cancers which primarily or solely affected women, and authorized increased appropriations.
* 1998: Establishes the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine to study pseudoscientific alternative medicine treatments for cancer
* 2009: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided in additional funding for the NIH; the NCI received from that amount.
* 2016: The 21st Century Cures Act increased funding for biomedical research. The &quot;Cancer Moonshot&quot; program promised additional support for cancer research.
* On October 17, 2017, Norman Sharpless was sworn in as the 15th director of the National Cancer Institute. In April 2019, Sharpless left NCI to serve as the acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs. He returned to the institute in November 2019 as director.

===Anti-cancer drug investigations===

== Programs ==
=== NCI-designated Cancer Centers ===
The NCI-designated Cancer Centers are one of the primary arms in the NCI&#x27;s mission in supporting cancer research. There are currently 72 so-designated centers; 9 cancer centers, 56 comprehensive cancer centers, and 7 basic laboratory cancer centers. NCI supports these centers with grant funding in the form of P30 Cancer Center Support Grants to support shared research resources and interdisciplinary programs. Additionally, faculty at the cancer centers receive approximately 75% of the grant funding awarded by the NCI to individual investigators.

The NCI cancer centers program was introduced in 1971 with 15 participating institutions.

=== National Clinical Trials Network ===
The National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) was formed in 2014, from the Cooperative Group program to modernize the existing system to support precision medicine clinical trials. With precision medicine, many patients must be screened to determine eligibility for treatments in development.

Lead Academic Participating Sites (LAPS) were chosen at 30 academic institutions for their ability to conduct clinical trials and screen a large number of participants and awarded grants to support the infrastructure and administration required for clinical trials. Most LAPS grant recipients are also NCI-designated cancer centers. NCTN also stores surgical tissue from patients in a nationwide network of tissue banks at various universities.

=== Developmental Therapeutics Program ===

The NCI Development Therapeutics Program (DTP) provides services and resources to the academic and private-sector research communities worldwide to facilitate the discovery and development of new cancer therapeutic agents.

Under the label &quot;Discovery &amp; Development Services&quot; several services are offered, among them the NCI-60 human cancer cell line screen and the Molecular Target Program.

In the Molecular Target Program thousands of molecular targets have been measured in the NCI panel of 60 human tumor cell lines. Measurements include protein levels, RNA measurements, mutation status and enzyme activity levels.

==== NCI-60 Human Tumor Cell Lines Screen ====

The evolution of strategies at the NCI illustrates the changes in screening that have resulted from advances in cancer biology. The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) operates a tiered anti-cancer compound screening program with the goal of identifying novel chemical leads and biological mechanisms. The DTP screen is a three phase screen which includes: an initial screen which first involves a single dose cytotoxicity screen with the 60 cell line assay. Those passing certain thresholds are subjected to a 5 dose screen of the same 60 cell-line panel to determine a more detailed picture of the biological activity. A second phase screen establishes the maximum tolerable dosage and involves in vivo examination of tumor regression using the hollow fiber assay. The third phase of the study is the human tumor xenograft evaluation.

Active compounds are selected for testing based on several criteria: disease type specificity in the in vitro assay, unique structure, potency, and demonstration of a unique pattern of cellular cytotoxicity or cytostasis, indicating a unique mechanism of action or intracellular target.

A high correlation of cytotoxicity with compounds of known biological mechanism is often predictive of the drugs mechanism of action and thus a tool to aid in the drug development and testing. It also tells if there is any unique response of the drug which is not similar to any of the standard prototype compounds in the NCI database.

<text>Nieuwstadt () () is a city in the Dutch province of Limburg. It is a part of the municipality of Echt-Susteren, and lies about 5 km north of Sittard. Nieuwstadt received city rights in 1277.

== History ==
It was first mentioned in 1242 as &quot;Novo Opido&quot;, and means &quot;new (fortified) city&quot;, and received city rights in 1277. Nieuwstadt was a border city of the Duchy of Guelders and received city walls. In 1383, it was severe damaged and a more compact settlement developed. In 1573, the walls were demolished and Nieuwstadt started to stagnate.

The Catholic St John the Baptist Church has a nave from the 13th century. The choir was added in the 14th century is slight crooked. The church was restored in 1862 by Pierre Cuypers. The church was damaged during World War II and was repaired in 1946.

Millen Castle is located to the south-east of Nieuwstadt. There is still a ruin of the medieval castle which probably had its origins in the 13th century. In 1365, a ring wall with two towers were added. Around 1450, a second ring was added. The castle was demolished from 1650 onwards. In the late-17th century, an estate was built near the former castle.

Nieuwstadt was home to 830 people in 1840. It was a separate municipality until 1982, when it was merged into Echt-Susteren.

<doc id="907842" wikidata="Q81186" url="?curid=907842" title="Genemuiden">
<text>Genemuiden is a city located in the north western part of the Province of Overijssel. It received city rights in 1275, which is also the first time Genemuiden gets mentioned in history.

It stayed independent up until 2001 when, despite fierce opposition of its inhabitants, it was forced to merge with the smaller, neighbouring villages of Zwartsluis and Hasselt to form the municipality of Zwartewaterland.
The town itself doesn&#x27;t have any buildings over 150 years old as two fires destroyed the town completely in 1866. These fires could not be controlled due to the great number of hay stacks in one street, &#x27;de Achterweg&#x27; or &#x27;Nachtweg&#x27;. This street still holds a non smoking sign, which is unique for a street in Europe.

Since the 18th century, the people from Genemuiden have been producing floor mats made of the bulrush that grows on the shores of the Zuiderzee. When the quality of the bulrush deteriorated in the 20th century, due to the change from salt water to fresh water (see Zuiderzee), the industry switched over to using coir imported from India to produce mats and carpets. In the sixties the first tufting machines were imported and currently Genemuiden is one of Europe&#x27;s main production centres of tufted carpet and artificial grass.

Genemuiden is a Protestant stronghold, having five Reformed Protestant denominations and no Roman Catholic church. It&#x27;s on the north-eastern tip of the so-called Dutch Bible Belt.

<doc id="907846" wikidata="Q100355757" url="?curid=907846" title="Ferry slip">
<text>A ferry slip is a specialized docking facility that receives a ferryboat or train ferry. A similar structure called a barge slip receives a barge or car float that is used to carry wheeled vehicles across a body of water.

Often a ferry intended for motor vehicle transport will carry its own adjustable ramp - when elevated it acts as a wave guard and is lowered to a horizontal position at the terminus to meet a permanent road segment that extends under water. In other cases, the ramp is installed at the ferry slip and is called a linkspan or apron. Such a ramp is adjustable to accommodate varying water heights and ferry loadings and to move it out of the way during approach and exit. If railcars are carried by the ferry the apron will have tracks for them.

In some parts of the world, the structures are also known as linkspans and transfer bridges.

Similar structures are used to receive barges, particularly if the barge is for the carriage of railcars.

==San Francisco example==
In the example shown below, a tugboat was positioned on the left side of the barge (our right in the apron view), pulling it with a stout rope called a springline. Nearly identical structures were used around San Francisco Bay. Unlike the electric motor drive used here and elsewhere, the Point Richmond ferry slip used water tanks as a portion of the counterweight, with the amount of water (provided by gravity from a local creek) regulated to move the apron up or down by admitting or draining water from the tanks.


Here, three tracks are provided for loading the barge. On the barge the three tracks are spread to allow clearance for the freight cars. The slip consists of pilings and guide boards to accurately position the barge relative to the apron. Once the barge is located properly, links are lowered from the apron to engage hooks on the barge, locking the linkspan and barge together.

While the apron shown could bear the weight of a locomotive, it could not withstand the traction, so a string of flatcars was used to link the locomotive to a short string of railcars, which were then moved on or off of the barge. If a locomotive was to be moved (a rare event), it would be moved by another locomotive using the same method. The auxiliary track to the left of the headworks was for storage of the flatcar string.

===Historical significance of this example===
This example, located in San Francisco, California, south of China Basin was a principal crew change point for maritime operations of the Santa Fe Railroad. It is no longer in use. It remains intact but there are no longer any connecting rails along the shoreline - once the province of the San Francisco Belt Railroad, operated along The Embarcadero by the state of California in support of maritime traffic. This was used extensively in an era when large cargo ships would contain crates or pallets of stores, moved to and from the ship&#x27;s cargo holds by crews of stevedores and on the docks by crews of longshoremen, with the ship&#x27;s own spar cranes and winches used for movement. Transport to and from the docks was mostly by rail. Rather than make a long trip down the San Francisco Peninsula, railcars were barged about the bay, both by the Santa Fe and by the Southern Pacific. Southern Pacific eventually replaced their multiple tug and barge system with a single specialized ferryboat. Two ferry slips were used by Santa Fe in San Francisco, here near China Basin, and at the north edge of town near the Maritime Museum. Most traffic would be taken across the bay to Oakland or Richmond for connection with the major transcontinental rail lines, with a small amount of traffic for California&#x27;s northern coastal region (the so-called Redwood Empire) passing through a slip at Tiburon on Richardson Bay.

San Francisco is no longer a significant port for freight as the mode of transport is now in containers, carried by container ships. The containers are loaded on and off ships at the Port of Oakland across the bay, conveniently close to the land modes of container transport - railroad and specialized trucking. The rise of the Port of Oakland and its dominance over San Francisco as a freight port is an example of the exploitation of a disruptive technology by a competitor with a relatively insignificant investment in the older form of the technology.

Facilities very similar to those pictured above were still in commercial operation as of 2007 in the Port of New York and New Jersey, transferring freight cars between Greenville Yard in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Bush Terminal Yard in Brooklyn, New York. They are run by New York New Jersey Rail, LLC.

==Professional career==
As a professional, Johnson won his first 15 bouts, including a nationally televised 4th round knockout over highly regarded veteran Tom &quot;The Bomb&quot; Bethea. However, Johnson lost for the first time as a professional in his next fight, against rising contender Matthew Franklin (later known as Matthew Saad Muhammad) by 12th round knockout in a furious battle for the NABF light heavyweight title. Following this setback, Johnson rallied, not for the last time in his career, impressively winning several bouts, until losing a decision to highly ranked Lottie Mwale. A subsequent win over Jerry Celestine set up a world title fight, which saw Johnson taking the WBC light heavyweight crown from fellow southpaw Mate Parlov of Yugoslavia via 10th-round KO in Italy in December 1978. For his first title defense, in April 1979, Johnson chose Matthew Franklin, the very man who had beaten him in an epic war two years earlier. In front of his hometown Indianapolis fans, Johnson engaged Franklin in a rematch of such intensity and drama that it is regarded among boxing historians as one of the greatest title fights in history. Mirroring their first brutal encounter, Johnson controlled the early going, but the Philadelphia-based Franklin gamely hung in. The tide turned in the 6th and 7th rounds as Johnson began to tire. Ultimately Franklin prevailed in the 8th, a round of such ferocity that it would enter boxing lore, stopping Johnson late in the frame, despite bleeding severely himself from the nose and from cuts around both eyes.

Showing the resilience that would mark his career, Johnson would again win a world title belt later that very year—this time the WBA version—by fighting the rugged Victor Galindez from Argentina in New Orleans as part of a three-fight &#x27;television card&#x27; that included two title bouts (Antuofermo-Hagler I and Benitez-Leonard) staged in Las Vegas. After a see-saw battle through the first ten rounds, Johnson nailed—and floored—Galindez with one of his fabled &#x27;over-the-top-from-underneath&#x27; left hands, and the title changed hands when the champion&#x27;s corner surrendered after Galindez hit the canvas.

As with his previous first title defense, Johnson again chose the strongest available contender to challenge for his belt, this time Eddie Gregory (later to be known as Eddie Mustafa Muhammad). On the Tate–Weaver undercard in Knoxville in March 1980, Johnson fought courageously, but ultimately succumbed to Eddie Mustafa Muhammad (né Gregory), who used a vicious body attack to outwork, out-hustle and out last the game champion en route to an 11th-round TKO victory.

Things looked bleak when Johnson fought the up-and-coming Michael Spinks in early 1981—just before Spinks dethroned Johnson&#x27;s latest conqueror, Mustafa Muhammad. Johnson was off to a promising start, but the 1976 Olympian Spinks landed his famous &quot;Spinks jinx&quot; that put Johnson out for good in the fourth round.

Johnson recovered and proceeded to win 16 straight fights, defeating good fighters like Charles Williams along the way, and in February 1986 would again be before his Indianapolis fans, fighting Leslie Stewart of Trinidad and Tobago for the WBA light heavyweight title that became vacant when Spinks abdicated to become a heavyweight. Stewart gave Johnson some fits, but cuts would take their toll on Stewart and were the reason that the fight was stopped in the seventh round, thus making Johnson the first ever three-time champion in the division. An injury postponed his first defense against Jean-Marie Emebe of Cameroon, but the two would hook up in Indianapolis in September of that year. It was the first time that Johnson would both enter and leave the ring as champion—he was the winner by 13th-round TKO.

Next, it was on to Trinidad and Tobago for a rematch with Stewart on May 23, 1987. However, it was all Stewart this time, as he floored Johnson several times in the first few rounds, and while Johnson always regained his feet and was never counted out he did tell his cornermen after eight rounds that &#x27;enough was enough,&#x27; and by doing so became an ex-champ for a third time.

Johnson retired after that bout.

==Honors==
Named The Ring magazine Comeback of the Year fighter for 1984.

==Professional boxing record==


==Life after boxing==
Johnson retired from the Marion County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in Indianapolis, Indiana, after more than 30 years of service as a civilian employee, correctional officer and deputy sheriff.

<text>Charmouth is a village and civil parish in west Dorset, England. The village is situated on the mouth of the River Char, around north-east of Lyme Regis. Dorset County Council estimated that in 2013 the population of the civil parish was 1,310. In the 2011 Census the population of the parish, combined with the small parish of Catherston Leweston to the north, was 1,352.

==History==
The history of Charmouth dates back to the Iron Age when a Celtic tribe, the Durotriges, founded a settlement. Evidence of hill forts can still be seen in the area. The name Charmouth originated from the Saxon &#x27;Cerne&#x27; meaning stony river, Charmouth was therefore known as &#x27;Cernmunde&#x27;.

Historian George Roberts wrote:

During the Saxon period, the neighbouring coast was particularly subject to the invasions of the Danes, concerning whom so much has been written. In 787, the Danes, Northern men, or Normans, landed at Portland from three ships, to reconnoitre the country, which they did without interruption, as the Saxons had neglected their marine. A. D. 833, according to the &quot;Saxon Chronicle&quot;, though some of our historians place the event in 831 or 832, a dreadful battle was fought at Charmouth. The Danes having met with repulses in other parts of the kingdom sailed to Charmouth where having landed, Speed says, &quot;they made cruel ravage and slaughter.&quot; Their fleet consisted of 35 ships, containing a powerful army: their whole force, Huntingdon remarks, must have amounted to 17,500 men; other writers have estimated their numbers at about 15,000. Egbert collected the whole force of the county, and marched to attack them, after they had continued their ravages, according to Matthew of Westminster, about a twelve month. The king had nearly succeeded in cutting them off as they were forming; he threw them into great confusion, but continual supplies of men from the ships turned the scale in their favour. The Saxons were routed: the night alone prevented their destruction by the infuriated invaders, by the favour of which, Speed says, the king hardly escaped. Among the number of the slain were two earls, his principal officers, Dudda and Osmond, Wigen, bishop of Sherborne, and Hereferth, bishop of Winton. The Danes, finding a settlement would be liable to the attacks of the brave Egbert, retired to their ships with precipitation, and set sail. They continued to hover about the coast. In 840, they effected a landing on the same spot, (set Carrum,) from the same number of ships. Ethelwulf&#x27;s army, which he headed in person, advanced to encounter them: a bloody battle ensued, which, after a desperate struggle, terminated in the Danes remaining masters of the field, though they shortly afterwards retired without any spoil. A successive series of invasions followed.
In 1086 in the Domesday Book Charmouth was recorded as &quot;Cernemude&quot;; it had 22 households, 3 ploughlands and of meadow. It was in Whitchurch Canonicorum Hundred and the tenant-in-chief was Count Robert of Mortain.

The buildings on either side of Charmouth&#x27;s main street vary in age; some of the smaller cottages date from the 17th or 18th century, while others are built in later Regency style. A number of buildings in the village have listed building status.

In the 18th and 19th centuries Charmouth village was a noted resort, with visitors including novelist Jane Austen who wrote that it was &quot;a nice place for sitting in unwearied contemplation&quot;.

===Church===
The present parish church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, was built in 1836, replacing an earlier building of circa 1503, which itself had replaced a mediaeval structure. Treves described it as &quot;exceptionally ugly&quot;.

===Abbots House===

Abbots House (previously The Queens Armes Hotel) is a grade II listed, early 16th-century house that was re-faced in the 18th century. It once belonged to Forde Abbey and the badge of Catherine of Aragon was found worked into the plaster of an upstairs room.

The inn gave shelter to the fugitive King Charles II on 22 September 1651, when he came disguised looking for a boat to take him to France following his defeat at the Battle of Worcester. A small trading ship was found bound for St Malo. The master, Stephen Limbry, agreed to pick up the King from Charmouth beach and transport him to the ship, but just two hours before the pick up Limbry told his wife, who locked him in his room and stole his clothes to ensure he would not become involved. 
On the following day Charles left Charmouth pursued by troops, who were alerted to his presence by an employee of the inn.

==Governance==
Charmouth was in its own electoral ward, which also includes Wootton Fitzpaine and the surrounding area. It had a population of 1,697 in the 2011 census.

Charmouth is part of the West Dorset constituency for elections to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Charmouth is part of the Lyme and Charmouth ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

==Geography==

Charmouth is a coastal village which overlooks Lyme Bay and is part of the Jurassic Coast. It lies among steep hills and is sited on a sloping site to the west of the River Char, close to its mouth at the English Channel. Stonebarrow Hill is to the east, Black Venn to the west, and Golden Cap, the highest cliff on the south coast of England at , is to the east. The National Trust owns significant portions of the surrounding area.

The cliffs above the beach are a noted source of fossils from the Jurassic period.

==Amenities==

There are shops and cafes by the beach and on the main street to serve locals and tourists, including a fossil shop, cafés, bakers, two pubs, and ironmonger. The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre is based in a long-disused cement factory on the foreshore. Charmouth Primary School is located to the south of the village within view of the beach. The Barrs Lane Recreation Ground has children&#x27;s play equipment and grass pitches, and is the site of an annual summer &#x27;party in the park&#x27; offering family entertainment.

<doc id="907858" wikidata="Q6412123" url="?curid=907858" title="King Tut's Wah Wah Hut">
<text>King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut, also known as King Tut&#x27;s, is a live music venue and bar on St. Vincent Street, Glasgow, Scotland. It is owned and managed by Glasgow-based gig promoters DF Concerts.

The Glasgow live music venue takes its name from a club in New York that hosted music, comedy and performing arts events in the 1980s.

==History==

King Tut&#x27;s was founded, in the former Saints and Sinners pub in St Vincent Street in the centre of Glasgow, by the DF Concerts boss Stuart Clumpas, who wanted to create a platform for promoting bands at club level, showcasing them with gigs seven days a week at a reasonable hour, after being unable to find such an establishment in the city centre&#x27;s nightlife. The venue first opened its doors in February 1990, and has established a reputation for showcasing new talent and hosting many well-known bands&#x27; first Scottish appearances. This reputation was acquired early on in 1993 when The Verve, Radiohead and Oasis all played in the Glasgow venue in a two-week period and it was in this time when Oasis were discovered and signed by the record label Creation. According to the venue&#x27;s manager, Dave McGeachan, the band &quot;bullied their way on stage&quot; after discovering that they would not be allowed to play despite travelling the long distance from Manchester. 

Others who have played gigs at King Tut&#x27;s early in their careers include Fiona Apple, Biffy Clyro, Coldplay, Beck, Blur, Crowded House, White Stripes, The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Skunk Anansie, Paramore, Lewis Capaldi and Travis, who played the live music venue regularly under their original name of Glass Onion.

Colin MacIntyre, the singer-songwriter from the Scottish indie band Mull Historical Society was reported as saying &quot;you haven&#x27;t made it unless you&#x27;ve played Tut&#x27;s&quot;. The appeal and popularity of King Tut&#x27;s has been credited to &quot;its consistency and dedication to bringing a cross-section of different styles to Glasgow&#x27;s doorstep&quot;

In 1999 King Tut&#x27;s decided to branch out with the launch of a monthly comedy night where comedians, including Phil Kay, Lynn Ferguson and Fred MacAulay, have taken to the stage, alongside some of Scotland&#x27;s rising young comics.

In February 2000, the ten-year anniversary of the Glasgow live music venue was celebrated with a series of one-off concerts, parties and surprise guests running over ten days. Due to the success of the event, a £25,000 refurbishment of the upstairs bar was completed.

In November 2001, King Tut&#x27;s was named Licensed Music Pub of the Year by the &quot;Scottish Licensed Trade News&quot;. It successfully applied for a 1am licence, which gave more time for performances.

In 2005, King Tut&#x27;s held &quot;The Best Scottish Bands of All Time&quot; night, which featured acts such as Snow Patrol, Idlewild, Eugene Kelly and Colin MacIntyre.

From 17 to 21 December 2008, Idlewild performed a series of live shows at the venue, playing each of their albums on consecutive nights.

King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut played host to the Homecoming Scotland 2009 Finale Celebrations in conjunction with the Clyde Auditorium.

In November 2017, the venue served as the location of the music video to former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher&#x27;s single &quot;Come Back To Me&quot;.

==T in the Park==

King Tut&#x27;s also ran King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Tent at what was Scotland&#x27;s biggest annual music festival, T in the Park, hosting many big acts. Their founder, Stuart Clumpas, now runs the festival. Over the years, acts such as the Manic Street Preachers, Teenage Fanclub, Snow Patrol, Doves, Primal Scream, Queens of the Stone Age, the Futureheads, the View, Jamie T, Dum Dums, Wheatus, Goldfinger, Twin Atlantic and the Pet Shop Boys have all performed on the stage.

Manic Street Preachers dedicated a song on stage to King Tut&#x27;s after lead guitarist and vocalist James Dean Bradfield stated that &quot;King Tut&#x27;s was the first venue to treat us properly and give us hot food on tour&quot;.

==Notable acts==
Many famous acts have performed at King Tut&#x27;s, including Amy Macdonald, Oasis, Rage Against the Machine, Biffy Clyro, Radiohead, Blur, Redd Kross, Travis, Pulp, The Verve, Crowded House, Wheatus, Average White Band, Goldfinger, Chuck Prophet and Beck. Paolo Nutini praised King Tut&#x27;s variety: &quot;I&#x27;ve never actually seen a big band at King Tut&#x27;s, you know that? But it&#x27;s the kind of place you can see anything. One night they&#x27;ll have a really great band playing their ass off and the next there&#x27;ll be a nice acoustic thing on. One gig I remember seeing there is Matt Berry, from &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; and &quot;Garth Marenghi&quot;. That just shows what a range of stuff you can find in Tut&#x27;s.&quot;

In 2017 The View played a record run of six sold-out shows at the venue.

==Album==
In 2011, singer-songwriter Tom McRae released an extended live album entitled &quot;Tom at Tut&#x27;s&quot; featuring songs and banter from his gigs on two consecutive nights in November 2004.

<text>IJzendijke is a city in the municipality of Sluis, about 10 km east of Oostburg, in the Dutch province of Zeeland.

The town received city rights in 1303.

== History ==
The town was first mentioned in 1127 as Isendica, and means &quot;dike of Iso (person)&quot;. IJzendijke used to be a possession of the Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Ghent. In 1127, it joined the Flemish Hanseatic League. In 1303, it received city rights. It was flooded in 1374, and lost completely in the St. Elizabeth&#x27;s flood of 1404.

In 1587, a sconce was constructed by the Spanish troops, and conquered by Maurice, Prince of Orange in 1604. Two &quot;polder&quot;s were constructed, and after 1618, an octagon fortress was built with a central market square. In 1648, IJzendijke became a garrison city.

The Dutch Reformed church is an aisleless church built between 1612 and 1614. Between 1656 and 1659, it was enlarged to a stretched octagon. The war damage was repaired in 1949.

Even though the fortress was deemed unconquerable, Napoleon managed to take the city. IJzendijk was home to 2,068 people in 1840. The fortification were demolished between 1841 and 1843 except for a western part.

The southern part of the IJzendijke was severely damaged in 1944. IJzendijke was a separate municipality until 1970. Prior to 2003, the town was in the municipality of Oostburg. In 2003, it became part of the municipality of Sluis.

<text>Recruitment is the overall process of identifying, sourcing, screening, shortlisting, and interviewing candidates for jobs (either permanent or temporary) within an organization. Recruitment also is the process involved in choosing people for unpaid roles. Managers, human resource generalists, and recruitment specialists may be tasked with carrying out recruitment, but in some cases, public-sector employment, commercial recruitment agencies, or specialist search consultancies such as Executive search in the case of more senior roles, are used to undertake parts of the process. Internet-based recruitment is now widespread, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI).

== Process ==
The recruitment process varies widely based on the employer, seniority and type of role and the industry or sector the role is in. Some recruitment processes may include;
* Job analysis for new jobs or substantially changed jobs. It might be undertaken to document the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) required or sought for the job. From these, the relevant information is captured in a person&#x27;s specification.
* Kick-Off Call- This is when the recruiter will connect with the hiring manager to understand the needs for the role.
* Sourcing — sorting through applicants and resumes to select candidates to screen.
* Screening and selection - picking, interviewing, and hiring the right candidate.
* Interviews: Shortlisted candidates are invited for interviews. The interview process may include one or more rounds of interviews with HR representatives, hiring managers, and sometimes panel interviews.

== Sourcing ==
Sourcing is the use of one or more strategies to attract and identify candidates to fill job vacancies. It may involve internal and/or external recruitment advertising, using appropriate media such as job portals, local or national newspapers, social media, business media, specialist recruitment media, professional publications, window advertisements, job centers, career fairs, or in a variety of ways via the internet.

Alternatively, employers may use recruitment consultancies or agencies to find otherwise scarce candidates—who, in many cases, may be content in their current positions and are not actively looking to move. This initial research for candidates—also called &quot;name generation&quot;—produces contact information for potential candidates, whom the recruiter can then discreetly contact and screen.

===Referral recruitment programs===
Referral recruitment programs allow both outsiders and employees to refer candidates for filling job openings. Online, they can be implemented by leveraging social networks.

=== Employee referral === 
An employee referral is a candidate recommended by an existing employee. This is sometimes referred to as . Encouraging existing employees to select and recruit suitable candidates results in:
* Improved candidate quality (&#x27;fit&#x27;). Employee referrals allow existing employees to screen, select and refer candidates, lowers staff attrition rate; candidates hired through referrals tend to stay up to 3 times longer than candidates hired through job boards and other sources. The one-to-one direct relationship between the candidate and the referring employee and the exchange of knowledge that takes place allows the candidate to develop a strong understanding of the company, its business and the application and recruitment process. The candidate is thereby enabled to assess their own suitability and likelihood of success, including &quot;fitting in.&quot;
* Reduces the considerable cost of third-party service providers who would have previously conducted the screening and selection process. An op-ed in &quot;Crain&#x27;s&quot; in April 2013 recommended that companies look to employee referral to speed the recruitment process for purple squirrels, which are rare candidates considered to be &quot;perfect&quot; fits for open positions.
* The employee typically receives a referral bonus, and is widely acknowledged as being cost-effective. The Global Employee Referral Index 2013 Survey found that 92% of participants reported employee referrals as one of the top recruiting sources.
* As candidate quality improves and interview-to-job-offer conversion rates increase, the amount of time spent interviewing decreases, which means the company&#x27;s employee headcount can be streamlined and be used more efficiently. Marketing and advertising expenditures decrease as existing employees source potential candidates from existing personal networks of friends, family, and associates. By contrast, recruiting through third-party recruitment agencies incurs a 20–25% agency finder&#x27;s fee – which can top $25K for an employee with $100K annual salary.

There is, however, a risk of less corporate creativity: An overly homogeneous workforce is at risk for &quot;fails to produce novel ideas or innovations.&quot;

===Social network referral===
Initially, responses to mass-emailing of job announcements to those within employees&#x27; social network slowed the screening process.

Two ways in which this improved are:
* Making available screen tools for employees to use, although this interferes with the &quot;work routines of already time-starved employees&quot;
* &quot;When employees put their reputation on the line for the person they are recommending&quot;

== Screening and selection ==
Various psychological tests can assess a variety of KSAOs ( including literacy. Assessments are also available to measure physical ability. Recruiters and agencies may use applicant tracking systems to filter candidates, along with software tools for psychometric testing and performance-based assessment. In many countries, employers are legally mandated to ensure their screening and selection processes meet equal opportunity and ethical standards.

Employers are likely to recognize the value of candidates who encompass soft skills, such as interpersonal or team leadership, and the level of drive needed to stay engaged—but most employers are still using degree requirements to screen out the 70+ million workers Skilled Through Alternative Routes (STARs) who already possess many of those skills. In fact, many companies, including multinational organizations and those that recruit from a range of nationalities, are also often concerned about whether candidate fits the prevailing company culture and organization as a whole. Companies and recruitment agencies are now turning to video screening as a way to notice these skills without the need to invite the candidates in person.

The selection process is often claimed to be an invention of Thomas Edison.

===Candidates with disabilities===
The word disability carries few positive connotations for most employers. Research has shown that the employer biases tend to improve through first-hand experience and exposure with proper supports for the employee and the employer making the hiring decisions. As for most companies, money and job stability are two of the contributing factors to the productivity of a disabled employee, which in return equates to the growth and success of a business. Hiring disabled workers produces more advantages than disadvantages. There is no difference in the daily production of a disabled worker. Given their situation, they are more likely to adapt to their environmental surroundings and acquaint themselves with equipment, enabling them to solve problems and overcome adversity than other employees. The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) grants companies Disabled Access Credit when they meet eligibility criteria.

=== Diversity ===
Many major corporations recognize the need for diversity in hiring to compete successfully in a global economy. The challenge is to avoid recruiting staff who are &quot;in the likeness of existing employees&quot; but also to retain a more diverse workforce and work with inclusion strategies to include them in the organization. More companies are starting to focus on DEI (Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion) within their recruitment tactics and techniques in order to offer a more welcoming and inclusive workplace for their employees. 

===Safer recruitment===
&quot;Safer recruitment&quot; refers to procedures intended to promote and exercise &quot;a safe culture including the supervision and oversight of those who work with children and vulnerable adults&quot;. The NSPCC describes safer recruitment as In England and Wales, statutory guidance issued by the Department for Education directs how safer recruitment must be undertaken within an educational context.

==Recruitment process outsourcing==
Recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) is a form of business process outsourcing (BPO) where a company engages a third-party provider to manage all or part of its recruitment process.

==Approaches==
Internal recruitment or internal mobility (not to be confused with &quot;internal recruiters&quot;) refers to the process of a candidate being selected from the existing workforce to take up a new job in the same organization, perhaps as a promotion, or to provide career development opportunity, or to meet a specific or urgent organizational need. Advantages include the organization&#x27;s familiarity with the employee and their competencies insofar as they are revealed in their current job, and their willingness to trust said employee. It can be quicker and have a lower cost to hire someone internally.

Many companies will choose to recruit or promote employees internally. This means that instead of searching for candidates in the general labor market, the company will look at hiring one of their own employees for the position. After searches that combine internal with external processes, companies often choose to hire an internal candidate over an external candidate due to the costs of acquiring new employees, and also on the fact that companies have pre-existing knowledge of their own employees’ effectiveness in the workplace. Additionally, internal recruitment can encourage the development of skills and knowledge because employees anticipate longer careers at the company. However, promoting an employee can leave a gap at the promoted employee’s previous position that subsequently needs to be filled. Traditionally, internal recruitment will be done through internal job postings. Another method of recruiting internally is through employee referrals. Having existing employees in good standing recommend coworkers for a job position is often a preferred method of recruitment because these employees know the values of the organization, as well as the work ethic of their coworkers. Some managers will provide incentives to employees who provide successful referrals.

Searching for candidates externally is another option when it comes to recruitment. In this case, employers or hiring committees will search outside of their own company for potential job candidates. The advantages of hiring externally is that it often brings fresh ideas and perspectives to the company. As well, external recruitment opens up more possibilities for the applicant pool than internal recruitment does. The conditions of the economy and labor market will impact the ability for a company to find and attract viable candidates. In order to make job openings known to potential candidates, companies will usually advertise their job in a number of ways. This can include advertising in local newspapers, journals, and online. Research has argued that social media networks offer job seekers and recruiters the opportunity to connect with other professionals cheaply. In addition, professional networking websites such as LinkedIn offer the ability to go through job seekers’ biographical resumes and message them directly even if they are not actively looking for a job. Attending job fairs, especially at secondary and post-secondary schools, is another method of recruiting external candidates.

An employee referral program is a system where existing employees recommend prospective candidates for the job offered, and usually, if the suggested candidate is hired, the employee receives a cash bonus.

Niche firms tend to focus on building ongoing relationships with their candidates, as the same candidates may be placed many times throughout their careers. Online resources have developed to help find niche recruiters. Niche firms also develop knowledge on specific employment trends within their industry of focus (e.g., the energy industry) and are able to identify demographic shifts such as aging and its impact on the industry.

Social recruiting is the use of social media for recruiting. As more and more people are using the internet, social networking sites, or SNS, have become an increasingly popular tool used by companies to recruit and attract applicants. A study conducted by researchers found that 73.5% of Cypriot companies had an account on an SNS, the most common being Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. There are many benefits associated with using SNS in recruitment, such as reducing the time required to hire someone, reduced costs, attracting more “computer literate, educated young individuals”, and positively impacting the company’s brand image. However, some disadvantages include increased costs for training HR specialists and installing related software for social recruiting. There are also legal issues associated with this practice, such as the privacy of applicants, discrimination based on information from SNS, and inaccurate or outdated information on applicant SNS.

Mobile recruiting is a recruitment strategy that uses mobile technology to attract, engage, and convert candidates.

Some recruiters work by accepting payments from job seekers, and in return help them to find a job. This is illegal in some countries, such as in the United Kingdom, in which recruiters must not charge candidates for their services (although websites such as LinkedIn may charge for ancillary job-search-related services). Such recruiters often refer to themselves as &quot;personal marketers&quot; and &quot;job application services&quot; rather than as recruiters.

Using multiple-criteria decision analysis tools such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and combining it with conventional recruitment methods provides an added advantage by helping the recruiters to make decisions when there are several diverse criteria to be considered or when the applicants lack past experience; for instance, recruitment of fresh university graduates.

Employers may re-recruit prior rejected candidates or recruit from retired employees as a way to increase the chances for attractive qualified applicants.

==Multi-tier recruitment model==
In some companies where the recruitment volume is high, it is common to see a multi-tier recruitment model where the different sub-functions are grouped together to achieve efficiency.

An example of a three-tier recruitment model:
* Tier 1 - Contact/help desk - This tier acts as the first point of contact where recruitment requests are being raised. If the requests are simple to fulfil or are queries in nature, resolution may take place at this tier.
* Tier 2 - Administration - This tier manages mainly the administration processes
* Tier 3 - Process - This tier manages the process and how the requests get fulfilled

===General===
Organizations define their own recruiting strategies to identify who they will recruit, as well as when, where, and how that recruitment should take place. Common recruiting strategies answer the following questions:
* What type of individuals should be targeted?
* What recruitment message should be communicated?
* How can the targeted individuals best be reached?
* When should the recruitment campaign begin?
* What should be the nature of a site visit?

===Practices===
Organizations develop recruitment objectives, and the recruitment strategy follows these objectives. Typically, organizations develop pre- and post-hire objectives and incorporate these objectives into a holistic recruitment strategy. Once an organization deploys a recruitment strategy it conducts recruitment activities. This typically starts by advertising a vacant position.

===Professional associations===
There are numerous professional associations for human resources professionals. Such associations typically offer benefits such as member directories, publications, discussion groups, awards, local chapters, vendor relations, government lobbying, and job boards.

Professional associations also offer a recruitment resource for human resources professionals.

== Corrupt practices in recruitment ==
In the United States, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has established guidelines for prohibited employment policies/practices. These regulations serve to discourage discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, etc. However, recruitment ethics is an area of business that is prone to many other unethical and corrupt practices. According to Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC), business ethics are a vital component to recruitment; hiring unqualified friends or family, allowing problematic employees to be recycled through a company, and failing to properly validate the background of candidates can be detrimental to a business.

When hiring for positions that involve ethical and safety concerns it is often the individual employees who make decisions which can lead to devastating consequences to the whole company. Likewise, executive positions are often tasked with making difficult decisions when company emergencies occur such as public relation nightmares, natural disasters, pandemics, or a slowing economy. Businesses that have made headlines for undesirable cultures may also have a difficult time recruiting new hires. Companies should aim to minimize corruption using tools such as the recruitment processes, pre-employment screening, personality tests, induction, training, and establishing a code of conduct.

In Germany, universities, though public employers, are generally not required to advertise most vacancies especially of academic positions (teaching and/or research) other than tenured full professors (&quot;verbeamtete Hochschullehrer&quot;). At the same time, anti-discrimination measures and equal opportunities (although required within the framework of the European Union) only apply to advertised jobs and to the wording of the job advert.

<text>Michael Smith, usually referred to as Mikey Smith (14 September 1954 – 17 August 1983), was a Jamaican dub poet. Along with Linton Kwesi Johnson, and Mutabaruka, he was one of the best-known dub poets. In 1978, Smith represented Jamaica at the 11th World Festival of Youth and Students in Cuba. His album &quot;Mi Cyaan Believe It&quot; includes his poem of the same title. He had left-anarchist leanings and Rastafarian sympathies, and was allegedly murdered by political opponents associated with the right-wing Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) after he had heckled the Jamaican Minister of Culture at a political rally on 17 August 1983.

==Life and work==
Born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1954, Smith was educated at Kingston College and the St. George&#x27;s College Extension School. He also studied at the Jamaican School of Drama with Jean &quot;Binta&quot; Breeze and Oku Onuora. Some of Smith&#x27;s work was released by Linton Kwesi Johnson on his LKJ label. Smith appeared on the BBC television series &quot;Ebony&quot; and the BBC also broadcast a documentary based on his association with Johnson. 
&quot;Mi Cyaan Believe It&quot; is most remembered for Smith&#x27;s heartfelt phrase: &quot;Laaawwwd - mi cyaan believe it - mi seh - mi cyaan believe it.&quot; In 1982, Smith released his debut album and performed extensively in Europe supporting such acts as Gregory Isaacs. He recorded a session for John Peel, which was broadcast by the BBC on 4 May 1982.
He continued to work as a social worker representing prisoners in Gun Court. His outspoken commentary on the &quot;isms and schisms of &#x27;politricks in Jamaica led to his life being cut short.

Linton Kwesi Johnson, during a presentation on Smith&#x27;s life and work at the second Caribbean Conference on Culture at the University of the West Indies, Mona campus, had the following to say: &quot;The late Jamaican poet, Michael Smith, was to my mind one of the most interesting and original poetic voices to emerge from the English-speaking Caribbean during the last quarter of the 20th century.&quot;

Johnson, who produced Smith&#x27;s first and only album in London, also wrote the following in an article for the &quot;Jamaica Observer&quot;: &quot;In 1978, Michael Smith represented Jamaica at the 11th World Festival of Youth and Students in Cuba. That year saw the release of his first recording, a single titled, &#x27;Word&#x27;, followed by perhaps his most famous piece &#x27;Mi Cyaan Believe It&#x27; and &#x27;Roots&#x27;.&quot;

In 1981, Smith performed in Barbados during CARIFESTA and was filmed by BBC Television performing &quot;Mi Cyaan Believe It&quot; for the documentary &quot;From Brixton To Barbados&quot;.

In 1982, Smith took London by storm with performances at the Camden Centre for the International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books, and also at Lambeth Town Hall in Brixton for &quot;Creation for Liberation&quot;.

While in Britain, together with Oku Onoura, Smith also did a successful poetry tour and recorded the &quot;Mi Cyaan Believe It&quot; album for Island Records.

Smith is the subject of Peter Ashbourne&#x27;s opera &quot;Reggae Opera Mikey&quot;.

==Death==
Smith was killed following a clash at a political rally at Stony Hill, St. Andrew, on 17 August 1983 (Marcus Garvey&#x27;s birthday); After arguing with three men, he was hit by a stone thrown by one of them. Linton Kwesi Johnson has recalled how the circumstances of Smith&#x27;s death are shrouded in controversy:
&quot;As far as I understand the facts, Mikey had attended a political meeting in Stony Hill where the ruling JLP Minister of Education was speaking and [he] had heckled her. The following day, he was confronted by three [persons believed to be] party activists, an argument ensued, stones were thrown and Mikey died from a blow to his head.&quot;
Kamau Brathwaite&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;History of the Voice&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Smith and describes him as having been &quot;stoned to death&quot;.

<text>Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta (23 September 1917 – 5 February 1984), best known by his ring name El Santo (English: &quot;The Saint&quot;), was a Mexican &quot;luchador enmascarado&quot; (or masked professional wrestler), actor and folk hero. He is one of the most famous and iconic Mexican &quot;luchadores&quot;, and has been referred to as one of &quot;the greatest legends in Mexican sports&quot;. His wrestling career spanned nearly five decades, during which he became a folk hero and a symbol of justice for the common man through his appearances in luchador films and comic books telling fictionalized stories of El Santo fighting for justice. He starred or co-starred in at least 53 movies between 1958 and 1982.

During his career, he mainly wrestled for Mexican promotion Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre, where he won the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship, Mexican National Middleweight Championship, Mexican National Tag Team Championship with Rayo de Jalisco, Mexican National Welterweight Championship, NWA World Middleweight Championship and the NWA World Welterweight Championship. Early in his career, he worked under a variety of ring names and gimmicks both masked and unmasked, before becoming El Santo, &quot;El Enmascarado de Plata&quot; (&quot;The Man in the Silver Mask&quot;), in 1942.

Santo&#x27;s brothers were also &quot;luchadores&quot;, with Black Guzmán being the first to make his debut and later Pantera Negra and Jimmy Guzmán joining them in wrestling as well. Only one of his eleven children followed him into professional wrestling, El Hijo del Santo (&quot;The Son of the Saint&quot;) making his debut in 1982. El Hijo del Santo&#x27;s son made his debut as &quot;Santo Jr.&quot; in 2016. Another grandson (not a son of El Hijo del Santo) originally wrestled as &quot;El Nieto del Santo&quot; (&quot;The Grandson of Santo&quot;), but now works under the name Axxel.

Santo is said to have popularized professional wrestling in Mexico just as Rikidōzan did in Japan. He was buried in his silver mask, in one of the biggest funerals in Mexico. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre honors him with the annual &quot;Leyenda de Plata&quot; (&quot;The Silver Legend&quot;) tournament. In 2018, WWE inducted Santo into their Hall of Fame&#x27;s Legacy wing.

==Childhood==
The fifth of seven children, Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta was born on 23 September 1917, in Tulancingo, Hidalgo, son of Jesús Guzmán Campuzano and Josefina Huerta (Márquez) de Guzmán. Rodolfo&#x27;s family came to Mexico City in the 1920s, where they settled in the Tepito neighborhood. He practiced baseball and American football, and then became interested in various styles of wrestling and grappling. He first studied Ju-Jitsu and then later competed in amateur wrestling. Rodolfo has a brother who entered the wrestling business as well, Miguel, who is known as Black Guzmán (due to his dark skin).

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career===
Accounts vary as to exactly when and where he first wrestled professionally, either in Arena Peralvillo Cozumel on 28 June 1934 or at Deportivo Islas in the Guerrero colony of Mexico City in 1935, but by the second half of the 1930s, he was established as a wrestler, using the names &quot;Rudy Guzmán&quot;, &quot;Hombre Rojo&quot; (&quot;the Red Man&quot;), &quot;El Demonio Negro&quot; (&quot;The Black Demon&quot;) and &quot;Murciélago Enmascarado II&quot; (&quot;The Masked Bat II&quot;). The last name was the same as that of El Murciélago Enmascarado (&quot;The Masked Bat&quot;), and after an appeal by Murciélago to the Mexican boxing and wrestling commission, the regulatory body ruled that Guzmán could not use the name.

===El Santo===

In the early 1940s, Guzmán married María de los Ángeles Rodríguez Montaño (Maruca), a union that would produce eleven children; including his youngest child Jorge, who also became a famous wrestler in his own right, El Hijo del Santo (&quot;The Son of Santo&quot;). In 1942, Guzmán&#x27;s manager, Don Jesús Lomelí, was putting together a new team of wrestlers, all dressed in silver, and wanted him to be a part of it. Lomelí suggested three names, &quot;El Santo&quot; (&quot;The Saint&quot;), &quot;El Diablo&quot; (&quot;The Devil&quot;) or &quot;El Angel&quot; (&quot;The Angel&quot;), and Guzmán chose the first one. On 26 July, aged 24, he wrestled at the Arena México for the first time as El Santo, although he later was known simply as &quot;Santo&quot;. Under this new name he quickly found his style.

One of Santo&#x27;s greatest matches was in 1952, when he fought a tag-team known as Los Hermanos Shadow (which consisted of famed luchadors Blue Demon and the Black Shadow). Santo beat and unmasked Black Shadow in the ring, which triggered Blue Demon&#x27;s decision to become a &quot;técnico&quot;, as well as a legendary feud between Santo and Blue Demon that culminated in his defeat in a well-publicized series of matches in 1952 and again in 1953. Although they appeared together in a number of action/adventure films, their rivalry never really ended in later years since Santo always remembered his defeat at Blue Demon&#x27;s hands.

El Santo was known to never remove his mask, even in private company. When traveling on flights, he made sure to take a different flight than his crew to avoid having them see his face when he was required to remove his mask to get through customs.

===Retirement===
By the early 1980s, El Santo slowed down his in-ring activities leading up to his inevitable retirement. His farewell tour was announced for August and September 1982. The first of three events took place on 22 August 1982 at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City. On that night, Santo teamed up with El Solitario to take on Villano III and Rokambole, in a match that naturally saw the legends win. After the match, Villano and Rokambole lifted Santo up on their shoulders as he received the adulation of the sold-out arena. The following Sunday, Santo appeared at Arena México, where he teamed up with Gran Hamada to defeat Villano I and Scorpio. Santo&#x27;s last match took place on 12 September 1982, a week before his 65th birthday. In his last ever match, Santo teamed up with Gory Guerrero who came out of retirement to reform &quot;La Pareja Atómica&quot; as they teamed up with Huracán Ramírez and El Solitario. Their opponents included one of Santo&#x27;s biggest rivals in Perro Aguayo, as well as El Signo, Negro Navarro and El Texano. True to the legend of Santo, he won his last match and retired as the hero he always portrayed in the ring and on the screen. His retirement tour was also used to introduce Santo&#x27;s son Jorge as the next generation El Santo, as he was ringside at each show wearing the silver mask and being introduced as El Hijo del Santo.

==Film career==
In 1952, a superhero motion picture serial was made entitled &quot;The Man in the Silver Mask&quot;, which was supposed to star Santo, but he declined to appear in it, because he thought it would fail commercially. The film was made instead with well-known luchador El Médico Asesino in the lead role, wearing a white mask similar to Santo&#x27;s silver one. A villain named &quot;The Silver-Masked Man&quot; was introduced into the plot at the last minute, thus the title of the film strangely became a reference to the villain, not the hero.

In 1958, Fernando Osés, a wrestler and actor, invited Santo to work in movies, and although Santo was unwilling to give up his wrestling career, he accepted, planning to do both at the same time. Osés was planning on playing the hero (a masked cop named &quot;El Incognito&quot;) in these two films, with Santo appearing as his costumed sidekick, &quot;El Enmascarado&quot;. Osés and Enrique Zambrano wrote the scripts for the first two movies, &quot;Santo contra el cerebro del mal&quot; (&quot;Santo vs. the Evil Brain&quot;) and &quot;Santo contra hombres infernales&quot; (&quot;Santo vs. the Infernal Men&quot;), both made in 1958, and directed by Joselito Rodríguez. Filming was done in Cuba, and ended just the day before Fidel Castro entered Havana and declared the victory of the revolution. The films apparently could not find a distributor for several years. Santo&#x27;s film career really took off in 1961 with his third movie &quot;Santo Contra los Zombies&quot; (&quot;Santo vs. the Zombies&quot;). Santo was given the starring role with this film, and was shown for the first time as a professional wrestler moonlighting as a superhero. When Santo&#x27;s film career took off in 1961, the producers of the first two films slyly entered Santo&#x27;s name into the titles and finally got them released.
Santo eventually wound up appearing in 53 luchador films in all (two of which were just cameo appearances). Because the films were produced quickly and cheaply, they relied on recycled plot structures and stereotypical characterization. The style of the movies was essentially the same throughout the series, with Santo as a superhero fighting supernatural creatures, evil scientists, various criminals, secret agents and so on. The tones were reminiscent of U.S. B-movies and TV shows, perhaps most similar to the old Republic Pictures serials of the 1940s. In Mexican cinemas, audience participation with the films was common.

His best-known movie outside of Mexico is also considered one of his best, 1962&#x27;s &quot;Santo contra las mujeres vampiro&quot; (&quot;Santo vs. The Vampire Women&quot;), which was also featured in an episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. In this movie, the production values were better, and there was an attempt at creating more of a mythos and background for Santo, as the last of a long line of superheroes. It was an enormous success at the box office. Only four of the 53 Santo films were ever dubbed into English, the other 48 being only available in Spanish. The English-dubbed Mexican films of that time period were imported to the United States through the efforts of K. Gordon Murray who changed the name of Santo to &quot;Samson&quot; for some of his releases. Most of Murray&#x27;s imported Mexi-films went directly to late-night American TV. Santo&#x27;s most financially successful film was &quot;The Mummies of Guanajuato&quot; (1970), which co-starred Blue Demon and Mil Máscaras.

The Santo film series inspired the production of similar series of movies starring other well-known luchadores such as Blue Demon, Mil Mascaras, Superzan, and the Wrestling Women (a.k.a. &quot;Las Luchadoras&quot;), among others. Santo even co-starred with Blue Demon and Máscaras in several of his movies. Blue Demon invited Santo to co-star with him and Máscaras in &quot;Los Campeones Justicieros&quot; (&quot;The Champions of Justice&quot;), however, Santo was too busy making other films to participate.

By 1977, the masked wrestler film craze had practically died off, but Santo continued to appear in more films over the next few years. His last film was &quot;Fury of the Karate Experts&quot;, shot in Florida in 1982, the same year he retired from the ring.

Seventeen years after Santo&#x27;s death, his real-life son played the lead role in a brand new Santo movie called &quot;Infraterrestre&quot; (&quot;Inner Earth&quot;), which co-starred Mexican wrestler Blue Panther.

==Other media==
In 1952, the artist and editor José G. Cruz started a Santo comic book, turning Santo into the first and foremost character in Mexican popular literature, his popularity only rivalled in the 1960s by the legendary Kalimán character. The Santo comic book series (four different volumes) ran continuously for 35 years, ending in 1987.

Santo also became an animated mini-series on Cartoon Network in Latin America, and was called &quot;Santo Contra Los Clones&quot;. On 27 October 2004, Cartoon Network released an only season of 5 short episodes. Each episode is about 2 minutes long, and they were shown weekly on Wednesday nights at 8:00 PM.

El Santo also inspired the Flash animated series &quot;¡Mucha Lucha!&quot; and &quot;El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera&quot;. In &quot;¡Mucha Lucha!&quot; he&#x27;s called &quot;El Rey&quot;, and is represented as an icon of all positive things.

Santo is immortalized in the rockabilly band Southern Culture on the Skids&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Santo Swings!/Viva el Santo&quot;. Santo is often resurrected in Southern Culture&#x27;s live performances when an audience member jumps onstage donning Santo&#x27;s mask. The Latin ska band King Changó released an album titled &quot;The Return of El Santo&quot;.

Turkish actor Yavuz Selekman portrayed an unlicensed version of Santo in the bootleg Turkish film &quot;3 Dev Adam&quot;. This movie is also known in the United States as &quot;Captain America and Santo vs. Spider-Man.&quot; An unauthorized Santo appeared in three films directed by Lee Demarbre – &quot;Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter&quot;, &quot;Harry Knuckles and the Treasure of the Aztec Mummy&quot;, and &quot;Harry Knuckles and the Pearl Necklace&quot; – in the films, Santo is portrayed by Jeff Moffe.

He also is referred to by Mexican rock band Botellita de Jerez in their song El Guacarrock Del Santo, in which they speak of Santo&#x27;s victories in the ring and in the movies as well as the great respect he was given as a Mexican movie hero.

Jeffrey Bell, writer/director of the American television series &quot;Angel&quot;, has stated that El Santo and his luchador brothers were an inspiration for the show&#x27;s &quot;The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco&quot; episode.

El Santo and several other masked wrestlers make a brief cameo in the &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot; comic series, based on the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series that originally aired in the 1960s. They aid Batman in defeating the evil luchador Bane after Batman cuts Bane off from using Venom to boost his strength.

==Death==

Just over a year after his retirement (in late January 1984), El Santo was a guest on &quot;Contrapunto&quot;, a Mexican television program and, without warning, removed his mask just enough to expose his face, in effect bidding his fans goodbye. It is the only documented case of Santo removing his mask in public. Santo died at a hospital from a heart attack (during a stage show he was putting on) on 5 February 1984, at 9:40 p.m., a week after his &quot;Contrapunto&quot; television appearance. He had been complaining of pain in his arm prior to his death. In accordance with his wishes, he was buried wearing his famous silver mask. Around 10 thousand people, including Blue Demon and Mil Mascaras, attended his funeral, which was among the largest in the history of Mexico. He was entombed at a crypt on the Mausoleos del Ángel cemetery in Mexico City. It reportedly took hours for Santo&#x27;s coffin to make it from the funeral parlour into the hearse.

==Legacy==

After his death, a statue of El Santo was erected in his home town of Tulancingo and other statues have been created since then.

Santo&#x27;s youngest son with his first wife, Jorge carries on the legend of the Silver Mask, wrestling as El Hijo del Santo wearing the silver mask, cape and outfit that is very close to what his father used to wear. While El Hijo del Santo is not as big an icon as his father, he is considered a more technically proficient wrestler.

In the early 1960s, a female wrestler called &quot;La Novia del Santo&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the Bride of El Santo&quot;) worked the Mexican circuit. Under the silver mask was Irma González, a well-known wrestler who had promised her fiancé that she would stop wrestling, but went back in the ring under a mask when she could not resist the draw of competition. La Novia got El Santo&#x27;s blessing to use the name and is the only non-family member ever given the right to use the Santo name. Gonzáles only wrestled as &quot;La Novia del Santo&quot; for 7 months until she got married. Later on, another wrestler adopted the &quot;La Novia del Santo&quot; name, but El Santo took action and put an end to the unauthorized use of the name.

In the 1990s, one of El Santo&#x27;s 25 grandchildren made his professional debut. After gaining some seasoning under different identities, he began working as &quot;El Nieto del Santo&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the Grandson of Santo&quot;) during the 2000s. El Hijo del Santo took legal actions to prevent this as he owns all &quot;El Santo&quot; rights when it comes to wrestling, presumably because he himself is planning on letting one of his own sons use the &quot;El Nieto del Santo&quot; name. These days, the grandson of El Santo works as &quot;Axxel&quot; and only uses &quot;El Nieto del Santo&quot; as an unofficial nickname to avoid any legal issues. Axxel uses the same trademark mask, cape and trunk design as El Santo but has incorporated black trim and knee pads, presumably not to infringe on the legal rights of El Hijo del Santo. In August 2012, a court ruled in favor of Axxel, allowing him to again begin working as El Nieto del Santo. In July 2016, another one of El Santo&#x27;s grandchildren and the son of El Hijo del Santo began working under the name &quot;El Santo Jr.&quot;

On 23 September 2016, to honor the 99th birthday of El Santo, Google Doodle ran a special El Santo Google doodle for that day.

He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018 as part of the Legacy Inductees of that year.

A skeletal version of El Santo, complete with silver mask and cape, appears briefly in the 2017 Pixar film &quot;Coco&quot; as a guest at a party in the Land of the Dead, with actress María Félix as his date.

<text>A psychological contract, a concept developed in contemporary research by organizational scholar Denise Rousseau, represents the mutual beliefs, perceptions, and informal obligations between an employer and an employee. It sets the dynamics for the relationship and defines the detailed practicality of the work to be done. It is distinguishable from the formal written contract of employment which, for the most part, only identifies mutual duties and responsibilities in a generalized form.

Although Rousseau&#x27;s 1989 article as highlighted by Coyle-Shapiro &quot;was very influential in guiding contemporary research&quot;, the concept of the psychological contract was first introduced by Chris Argyris (1960): Since the foremen realize the employees in this system will tend to produce optimally under passive leadership, and since the employees agree, a relationship may be hypothesized to evolve between the employees and the foremen which might be called the &quot;psychological work contract.&quot; The employee will maintain the high production, low grievances, etc., if the foremen guarantee and respect the norms of the employee informal culture (i.e., let the employees alone, make certain they make adequate wages, and have secure jobs).

Psychological contracts are defined by the relationship between an employer and an employee where there are unwritten mutual expectations for each side. A psychological contract is rather defined as a philosophy, not a formula or devised plan. One could characterize a psychological contract through qualities like respect, compassion, objectivity, and trust. Psychological contracts are formed by beliefs about exchange agreements and may arise in a large variety of situations that are not necessarily employer-employee. However, it is most significant in its function as defining the workplace relationship between employer and employee. In this capacity, the psychological contract is an essential, yet implicit agreement that defines employer-employee relationships. These contracts can cause virtuous and vicious circles in some circumstances. Multiple scholars define the psychological contract as a perceived exchange of agreement between an individual and another party. The psychological contract is a type of social exchange relationship. Parallels are drawn between the psychological contract and social exchange theory because the relationship&#x27;s worth is defined through a cost-benefit analysis. The implicit nature of the psychological contract makes it difficult to define, although there is some consensus on its nature. This consensus identifies psychological contracts as &quot;promissory, implicit, reciprocal, perceptual, and based on expectations.&quot;

These psychological contracts can be impacted by many things like mutual or conflicting morals and values between employer and employee, external forces like the nudge theory, and relative forces like Adams&#x27; equity theory.

==History==
The concept of psychological contract became more popular among researchers starting in the 1990s, but was named decades earlier in 1960 by Chris Argyris. As studies in industrial relations developed and grew more complex, it was revealed that employees are more likely to perform better in certain work environments. The works of Frederick Winslow Taylor in the first decades of the 20th century focused on how to enhance worker efficiency. Building upon this, Douglas McGregor developed Theory X and Theory Y in the 1950s to define two contrasting types of management styles that were each effective in attaining a certain goal. These differing management types hold different psychological contracts between employer and employee (described in more detail below in ).

Works by Denise M. Rousseau and later described the psychological contract in more depth. Sandra L. Robinson indicated employees commonly reported a breach of the psychological contract within several years of beginning their position, and that the effects of contract breach negatively affected employee productivity and retention.

Maslach, Schaufeli and Leiter stated in 2001:
Now employees are expected to give more in terms of time, effort, skills, and flexibility, whereas they receive less in terms of career opportunities, lifetime employment, job security, and so on. Violation of the psychological contract is likely to produce burnout because it erodes the notion of reciprocity, which is crucial in maintaining well-being.

== Formation of the contract ==
Psychological contract formation is a process whereby the employer and the employee or prospective employee develop and refine their mental maps of one another. According to the outline of phases of psychological contract formation, the contracting process begins before the employment itself and develops throughout the course of employment. As the employment relationship grows, the psychological contract also grows and is reinforced over time. However, the psychological contract is effective only if it is consented to voluntarily. It is also useful in revealing what incentives workers may expect to receive in return for their employment. There are two types of contracts depending on the nature of the relationship between employee and employer. These are relational psychological contracts and transactional psychological contracts. 
# Transactional psychological contract: focuses more on the explicit elements of the contract without accounting much for the intrinsic motivations of workers. These are more common in organizations with authoritative management styles and hierarchal control. Transactional contracts are found to be &quot;related to careerism, lack of trust in employer, and greater resistance to change.&quot; They tend to be shorter term in nature.Some scholars consider McGregor&#x27;s Theory X to be closely related to transactional employer-employee relationships or authoritarian management, which are bound by transactional psychological contracts that aim to keep people working for extrinsic reasons and maintain the status quo.
# Relational psychological contract: stresses the interdependence of the organization and level of social exchange. These psychological contracts tend to be longer-term in nature.McGregor&#x27;s Theory Y is seen in participative management which emphasizes the role of leadership. This has similarities with relational psychological contracts in terms of common emphasis on commitment and belief in the intrinsic motivations of people who may want to work for something beyond merely monetary reasons. Relational contracts are found to be associated with trust and increased acceptance of change.
The content of psychological contracts varies widely depending on several factors including management style, as discussed earlier. It also depends on the type of profession and differs widely based on the stage in the career; for example, between graduates and managers. Denise Rousseau is credited with outlining these 5 phases of contract formation:
# Pre-employment: The initial expectations of the employee form through professional norms and societal beliefs that may be influenced by information gathered about the organization and how certain occupations are portrayed by the media.
# Recruitment: The first instance of two-way communication involving promise exchanges between employer and prospective employee during the recruiting process.
# Early socialization: Promise exchanges continue with both parties actively continuing their search for information about one another through multiple sources.
# Later experiences: The promise exchange and search for information processes slow down as the employee is no longer considered new. There may be changes to the psychological contract introduced at this stage.
# Evaluation: The existing psychological contract is evaluated and possibly revised and it is determined whether a revision is needed. Incentives and costs of change impact revision.

The psychological contract model is applicable not only to supervisor-subordinate relationships but also to business relationships. In 2015, a study was conducted on hotel franchising. Franchising is an agreement between a brand owner and franchisee that grants the franchisee rights to use the brand in exchange for a fee. According to the study, apart from this, the franchisee agreement includes an unwritten psychological contract agreement, consisting of unwritten promises and obligations between both parties.

==Stages in career development==
The employment relationship emerges through the interpersonal relationships formed in the workplace. How employers, supervisors and managers behave on a day-to-day basis is not determined by the legal contract. Employees slowly negotiate what they must do to satisfy their side of the bargain, and what they can expect in return. This negotiation is sometimes explicit, e.g. in appraisal or performance review sessions, but it more often takes the form of behavioral action and reaction through which parties explore and draw the boundaries of mutual expectation. Hence, the psychological contract determines what the parties will, or will not do and how it will be done. When the parties&#x27; expectations match each other, performance is likely to be good and satisfaction levels will be high. So long as the values and loyalty persist, trust and commitment will be maintained.

The map followed by the parties is the development of an individualized career path that makes only reasonable demands on the employee, with adequate support from managers and co-workers, for a level of remuneration that is demonstrably fair for a person of that age, educational background, and experience. Motivation and commitment will be enhanced if transfers and promotions follow the agreed path in a timely fashion.

The psychological contract changes over time. Since an employee&#x27;s level of work changes as they advance in their career, the psychological contract that was established when they first began their career changes, too. As an employee is promoted throughout their career they expect more from their psychological contract because they are putting more of themselves into their work. Each stage of a career creates another editing process to the contract. The stages include apprentice, colleague, mentor, sponsor, exploration, establishment, maintenance, and disengagement. The details of each step are as follows:
# Apprentice stage: Employees are new to the company and are expected to learn what they are supposed to do in this stage under the supervision of people in higher stages. Employees do their best to meet the expectations of the employer.
# Colleague stage: Employees in this stage work more independently and handle tasks without supervision. They work harder to prove to the employer they are capable of completing assignments alone.
# Mentor stage: Employees in this stage have the ability to oversee apprentices and guide them while also completing their own work.
# Sponsor stage: Employees in this stage take on managerial roles and help better the company rather than oversee apprentices like in the mentor stage.
# Exploration stage: Employees in this stage are new and have an unclear path in their career and are uncertain if they will stay with the same organization. They search for guidance and motivation from the organization to help them made decisions about their future.
# Establishment stage: Employees in this stage want to establish themselves in their organization. Employees want more responsibilities, more opportunities for promotion, and performance-based rewards.
# Maintenance stage: Employees in this stage feel as if their role in the organization has reached a stagnation and care to pursue other things in life besides just work.
# Disengagement stage: Employees in this stage are nearing the end of their career path. They are close to retiring, take on less work, and work at slower paces.
Studies from Canadian adjunct professor and psychology researcher Yani Likongo demonstrated that sometimes in organizations an idiosyncratic psychological contract is built between the employee and his direct supervisor in order to create an &quot;informal deal&quot; regarding work-life balance. These &quot;deals&quot; support the idea of a constructivist approach including both the employer and the employee, based on a give-and-take situation for both of them. Similarities are drawn between the psychological contract and social exchange theory in that the relationship&#x27;s worth is defined through a cost-benefit analysis. The employee&#x27;s attitude toward changes in the company which lead to changes in the psychological contract . An employee&#x27;s attitude toward change in the job is directly linked to the employee&#x27;s psychological contract with the manager or employer. An employee&#x27;s attitude and mindset about what changes could benefit them in what ways could affect the psychological contract they have with the manager.

If managed effectively, the relationship will foster mutual trust between the parties, matching the objectives and commitments of the organization to those of their employees. But a negative psychological contract can result in employees becoming disenchanted, demotivated and resentful of authoritarianism within the organization. This will result in an increasingly inefficient workforce whose objectives no longer correspond to the organization they work for. The main cause of disappointment tends to be that middle managers are protective of their status and security in the eyes of their superiors, and this can introduce conflicts of interest when they are required to fulfill their obligations to their subordinates.

==Breach==
Psychological contracts are largely reliant on promises between the employer and employee being kept, with trust being the basis for the social exchange. A breach in the psychological contract occurs if employees perceive that their firm, or its agents, have failed to deliver on what they perceive was promised, or vice versa. Employees or employers who perceive a breach are likely to respond negatively as it may oftentimes result in an immediate response of mistrust from the other side. Responses may occur in the form of reduced loyalty, commitment, and organizational citizenship behaviors. These feelings typically increase negative tension in the environment. Perceptions that one&#x27;s psychological contract has been breached may arise shortly after the employee joins the company or even after years of satisfactory service. A breach in the contract may occur when the organizational changes are not necessarily beneficial for employees because of extenuating factors such as globalization and fast-changing markets. The impact may be localized and contained, but if morale is more generally affected, the performance of the organization may be diminished. The risk for breach may be reduced when the organization knows and respects the contracts of the employees. Further, if the activities of the organization are perceived as being unjust or immoral, e.g. aggressive downsizing or outsourcing causing significant unemployment, its public reputation and brand image may also be damaged.

==Psychological contracts in teams==
Psychological contracts have also been theorized to occur within teams of individuals as they share everyday experiences, are subject to similar team-level promises, and interact collectively with other organizational agents. Based on the macrosociological perspective of social exchange theory as well as theories on the role of social influence in psychological contract evaluations, shared psychological contract fulfilment (PCF) shapes the relationship between individual PCF and outcomes, as well as facilitate the emergence of specific team states. Team-level PCF has been associated with higher levels of team engagement, lower average turnover intention, and higher and more positive affective climates. This line of research has suggested that organizations do not exclusively develop psychological contracts with individuals but also with groups or teams as entities that develop exchanges with an organization as a whole. This idea was also developed by Denise Rousseau when she described the notion of &quot;normative contracts&quot; in her seminal 1995 book.

<text>Around the Sun is the thirteenth studio album by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on October 5, 2004 on Warner Bros. Records. The album was supported by several singles and a world tour. It was commercially successful but received mixed reception and is often considered the weakest in the band&#x27;s catalogue.

==Description==

The album was released in four editions: Double vinyl, cassette (the band&#x27;s final release on the medium), compact disc, and a limited-edition box set with the CD and fold-out posters by 14 artists illustrating the songs.

&quot;The Outsiders&quot; features a guest appearance by rapper Q-Tip. When the song was performed live, Michael Stipe carried out the rap, as he did on a later B-side release of the song.

&quot;Final Straw&quot; is a politically charged song. The version on the album is a remix of the original version, which had been made available as a free download on March 25, 2003, from the band&#x27;s website. The song was written in protest of the U.S. government&#x27;s actions in the Iraq War. The song evolved from an instrumental demo titled &quot;Harlan County with Whistling,&quot; recorded during the sessions for the band&#x27;s 1994&#x27;s album &quot;Monster&quot; and released with its 25th anniversary edition in 2019.

&quot;Around the Sun&quot; was the first of only two R.E.M. albums to include a title track (the second being its follow-up, &quot;Accelerate&quot;). The album was also a first for R.E.M. in that it was their first to feature Bill Rieflin, the band&#x27;s de facto replacement for former drummer Bill Berry, who had retired in 1997. Although Rieflin was never officially inducted into the band as a member, he would serve as a regular auxiliary musician for R.E.M. until the band&#x27;s dissolution in 2011.

==Reception==
&quot;Around the Sun&quot; received mixed to negative reviews from critics noted at review aggregator Metacritic. It has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 27 reviews.

Despite hitting number one in the UK, it became their first studio album to miss the US top 10 (reaching number 13 during seven weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200) since 1988&#x27;s &quot;Green&quot;. As of March 2007, &quot;Around the Sun&quot; had sold two million copies worldwide and 232,000 units in the US. This is fewer than R.E.M. sold in the first week of an album&#x27;s release while at their early to mid-1990s commercial peak.

Lead single &quot;Leaving New York&quot; became a UK top 5 hit, while &quot;Aftermath&quot;, &quot;Electron Blue&quot; and &quot;Wanderlust&quot; became minor hits. &quot;Around the Sun&quot; had no singles success in the United States. It was the band&#x27;s first studio album to fail to chart a song on the Hot 100 since &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; in 1985.

After the release of the following &quot;Accelerate&quot;, guitarist Peter Buck said &quot;Around the Sun&quot; &quot;just wasn&#x27;t really listenable, because it sounds like what it is: a bunch of people that are so bored with the material that they can&#x27;t stand it anymore.&quot; &quot;The songs on &quot;Around the Sun&quot; are great,&quot; remarked singer Michael Stipe. &quot;But, in the process of recording, we lost our focus as a band.&quot; Mike Mills concurs: &quot;It&#x27;s an unfocused record. But the songs are good, because there&#x27;s a live record from Dublin that came out not long after that, and we did a lot of those songs, and they sound fantastic. It&#x27;s not on Pat McCarthy, it&#x27;s on us; we just lost our groove.&quot;

Retrospectives of the band&#x27;s career cite this album as their nadir. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; marked this as number 44 on their list of 50 horrible albums by brilliant artists, calling all of their post-Bill Berry studio albums &quot;stellar&quot; except for this one.

==Reissue==
In 2005, Warner Bros. Records issued an expanded two-disc edition of &quot;Around the Sun&quot; which includes a CD, a DVD-Audio disc containing a 5.1-channel surround sound mix of the album done by Elliot Scheiner, and the original CD booklet with expanded liner notes.

A remix of the song &quot;Final Straw&quot; appeared earlier in 2004 on the compilation album &quot;Future Soundtrack for America&quot;.

After being out of print for several years, the vinyl LP edition was re-pressed in 2023.

<doc id="907890" wikidata="Q18011049" url="?curid=907890" title="Dune (franchise)">
<text>Dune is an American science fiction media franchise that originated with the 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert and has continued to add new publications. &quot;Dune&quot; is frequently described as the best-selling science fiction novel in history. It won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Hugo Award in 1966 and was later adapted into a 1984 film, a 2000 television miniseries, and a two-part film series with the first film in 2021 and a in 2024. Herbert wrote five sequels, the first two of which were concomitantly adapted as a 2003 miniseries. &quot;Dune&quot; has also inspired tabletop games and a series of video games. Since 2009, the names of planets from the &quot;Dune&quot; novels have been adopted for the real-world nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan.

Frank Herbert died in 1986. Beginning in 1999, his son Brian Herbert and science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson published several collections of prequel novels, as well as two sequels that complete the original &quot;Dune&quot; series (&quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; in 2007), partially based on Frank Herbert&#x27;s notes discovered a decade after his death. As of 2024, 23 &quot;Dune&quot; books by Herbert and Anderson have been published.

The political, scientific, and social fictional setting of Herbert&#x27;s novels and derivative works is known as the &quot;Dune&quot; universe or Duniverse. Set tens of thousands of years in the future, the saga chronicles a civilization that has banned all &quot;thinking machines&quot;, which include computers, robots, and artificial intelligence. In their place, civilization has developed advanced mental and physical disciplines as well as advanced technologies that adhere to the ban on computers. Vital to this empire is the harsh desert planet Arrakis, the only known source of the spice melange, the most valuable substance in the universe.

For the similarities between some of Herbert&#x27;s terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the Arabic language, as well as the series&#x27; &quot;Islamic undertones&quot; and themes, a Middle Eastern influence in Herbert&#x27;s works has been widely noted.

==Premise==
The &quot;Dune&quot; saga is set thousands of years in humanity&#x27;s future. Faster-than-light travel has been developed, and humans have colonized a vast number of worlds. However, a great reaction against computers has resulted in a ban on any &quot;thinking machine&quot;, with the creation or possession of such punishable by immediate death. Despite this prohibition, humanity continues to develop and advance other branches of technology, including extrasensory perception (ESP) and instruments of war. At the time of the first book&#x27;s setting, humanity has formed a feudal interstellar empire known as the Imperium, run by several Great Houses that oversee various planets. Of key interest is the planet Arrakis, known to the native population as &quot;Dune&quot;. A desert planet with barely any precipitation, it is the only planet where a special life-extending drug, melange (or &quot;the spice&quot;), can be found. In addition to life extension, melange enhances the mental capacity of humans through prescience, allowing the Spacing Guild pilots (mutated by heavy melange use) to navigate folded space and travel the distances between planets; and triggers some of the powers of the Bene Gesserit, a religious group that secretly seeks to control the direction humanity takes. Melange is challenging to acquire due to the harsh environment of Arrakis, and the presence of giant sandworms that are drawn towards any rhythmic sounds on the sands of the desert. Feudal control over the fiefdom Arrakis, its spice production, and the impact on humanity&#x27;s development become the centerpoints of a millennia-long conflict that develops through the series.

==Plot arc==

The &quot;Dune&quot; universe, set in the distant future of humanity, has a history that stretches thousands of years (some 15,000 years in total) and covers considerable changes in political, social, and religious structure as well as technology. Creative works set in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe can be said to fall into five general time periods:

===The Butlerian Jihad===
As explained in &quot;Dune&quot;, the Butlerian Jihad is a conflict taking place over 11,000 years in the future (and over 10,000 years before the events of &quot;Dune&quot;), which results in the total destruction of virtually all forms of &quot;computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots&quot;. With the prohibition &quot;Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind,&quot; the creation of even the simplest thinking machines is outlawed and made taboo, which has a profound influence on the socio-political and technological development of humanity in the &quot;Dune&quot; series. Herbert refers to the Jihad several times in the novels, but does not give much detail on how he imagined the causes and nature of the conflict. Critical analysis has often associated the term with Samuel Butler and his 1863 essay &quot;Darwin among the Machines&quot;, which advocated the destruction of all advanced machines.

In Herbert&#x27;s &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), Leto II Atreides indicates that the Jihad had been a semi-religious social upheaval initiated by humans who felt repulsed by how guided and controlled they had become by machines. This technological reversal leads to the creation of the universal Orange Catholic Bible and the rise of a new feudal pan-galactic empire that lasts for over 10,000 years before Herbert&#x27;s series begins. Several secret societies also develop, using eugenics programs, intensive mental and physical training, and pharmaceutical enhancements to hone human skills to an astonishing degree. Artificial insemination is also prohibited, as explained in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969), when Paul Atreides negotiates with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, who is appalled by Paul&#x27;s suggestion that he impregnate his consort in this manner.

Herbert died in 1986, leaving his vision of the events of the Butlerian Jihad unexplored and open to speculation. The &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson presents the Jihad as a war between humans and the sentient machines they had created, who rise up and nearly destroy humanity. The series explains that humanity had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines; recognizing this weakness, a group of ambitious, militant humans calling themselves the Titans use this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe. Their reign lasts for a century; eventually they give too much access and power to the AI program Omnius, which usurps control from the Titans themselves. Seeing no value in human life, the thinking machines—now including armies of robot soldiers and other aggressive machines—dominate and enslave nearly all of humanity in the universe for 900 years, until a jihad is ignited. This crusade against the machines lasts for almost a century, with much loss of human life but ultimately ending in human victory.

===The Corrino-led Imperium===

The ancient Battle of Corrin—occurring 20 years after the end of the Butlerian Jihad—spawns the Padishah Emperors of House Corrino, who rule the known universe for millennia by controlling the Sardaukar, a brutally efficient military force. Ten thousand years later, Imperial power is balanced by the assembly of noble houses called the Landsraad, which enforces the Great Convention&#x27;s ban on the use of atomics against human targets. Though the power of the Corrinos is unrivaled by any individual House, they are in constant competition with each other for political power and stakes in the omnipresent CHOAM company, a directorship that controls the wealth of the entire Empire. The third primary power in the universe is the Spacing Guild, which monopolizes interstellar travel and banking. Mutated Guild Navigators use the spice drug melange to successfully navigate &quot;folded space&quot; and safely guide enormous heighliner starships from planet to planet instantaneously.

The matriarchal Bene Gesserit possesses almost superhuman physical, sensory, and deductive powers developed through years of physical and mental conditioning. While positioning themselves to &quot;serve&quot; humanity, the Bene Gesserit pursue their goal to better the human race by subtly and secretly guiding and manipulating the affairs of others to serve their own purposes. By the time of &quot;Dune&quot;, they have secured a level of control over the current emperor, Shaddam IV, by marrying him to one of their own who intentionally bears him only daughters. The Bene Gesserit also has a secret, millennia-long selective breeding program to bolster and preserve valuable skills and bloodlines as well as to produce a theoretical superhuman male they call the Kwisatz Haderach. When &quot;Dune&quot; begins, the Sisterhood is only one generation away from their desired individual, having manipulated the threads of genes and power for thousands of years to produce the required confluence of events. But Lady Jessica, ordered by the Bene Gesserit to produce a daughter who would breed with the appropriate male to make the Kwisatz Haderach, instead bears a son—unintentionally producing the Kwisatz Haderach a generation early.

&quot;Human computers&quot; known as Mentats have been developed and perfected to replace the capacity for logical analysis lost through the prohibition of computers. Through specific training, they learn to enter a heightened mental state in which they can perform complex logical computations that are superior to those of the ancient thinking machines. The Bene Tleilax are amoral merchants who traffic in biological and genetically engineered products such as artificial eyes, &quot;twisted&quot; Mentats, and gholas. Finally, the Ixians produce cutting-edge technology that seemingly complies with (but pushes the boundaries of) the prohibitions against thinking machines. The Ixians are very secretive, not only to protect their valuable hold on the industry but also to hide any methods or inventions that may breach the anti-thinking machine protocols.

Against this backdrop, the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) chronicles the return from obscurity of House Atreides, whose role in the Butlerian Jihad is all but forgotten. The Imperial House schemes to gain full control of the Empire through the control of melange, precisely at the time that the Bene Gesserit breeding program is nearing fruition.

===The rise of the Atreides===

As Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1965) begins, Duke Leto Atreides finds himself in a dangerous position. The 81st Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV, has put him in control of the desert planet Arrakis, known as Dune, which is the only source of the all-important spice melange. The most valuable commodity in the known universe, the spice not only makes safe and reliable interstellar travel possible, but also prolongs life, protects against disease, and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities. The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis is an expensive and hazardous undertaking, thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giant sandworms that protect the spice. In addition, Leto is aware that Shaddam, feeling threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides, has sent him into a trap. Failure to meet or exceed the production volume of his predecessor, the villainous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, will harm the position of House Atreides in CHOAM, which relies on spice profits. Further, the very presence of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long-simmering War of Assassins between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a feud ignited 10,000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad.

The little-understood native population of Arrakis are the Fremen, long overlooked by the Imperium. Considered backward savages, the Fremen are extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers; their culture is built around the commodity of water, which is extremely scarce on Arrakis. The Fremen await the coming of a prophesied messiah, not suspecting that this prophecy had been planted in their legends by the Missionaria Protectiva, an arm of the Bene Gesserit dedicated to religious manipulation to ease the path of the Sisterhood when necessary. In &quot;Dune&quot;, the so-called &quot;Arrakis Affair&quot; puts unexpected Kwisatz Haderach Paul Atreides in control of first the Fremen people and then Arrakis itself. Absolute control over the spice supply allows Paul to depose Shaddam and become ruler of the known universe, with Shaddam&#x27;s eldest daughter Princess Irulan as his wife. With a bloody jihad subsequently unleashed across the universe in Paul&#x27;s name but out of his control, the Bene Gesserit, Tleilaxu, Spacing Guild, and House Corrino conspire to dethrone him in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969). Though the plot fails, the Atreides Empire continues to devolve in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976) as the religion built around Paul falters, Irulan&#x27;s sister Wensicia conspires to place her son Farad&#x27;n on the throne, and Paul&#x27;s twin heirs Leto II and Ghanima rise to power.

The &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; series (2008–2009) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson chronicles the major events that take place between &quot;Dune: House Corrino&quot; (2001) and &quot;Dune: The Duke of Caladan&quot; (2020), between &quot;Dune&quot; (1965) and &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969), and between &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976).

===The reign and fall of the God Emperor===

At the time of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), Paul&#x27;s son, the God Emperor Leto II Atreides, has ruled the Empire for 3,500 years from the verdant face of a transformed Arrakis; melange production has ceased. Leto has forced the sandworms into extinction, except for the larval sandtrout with which he had forged a symbiosis, transforming him into a human-sandworm hybrid. Human civilization before his rule had suffered from twin weaknesses: that a single authority could control it and that it was dependent upon melange, found on only one planet in the known universe. Leto&#x27;s prescient visions had shown that humanity would be threatened by extinction in any number of ways; his solution was to place humanity on his &quot;Golden Path,&quot; a plan for humanity&#x27;s survival. Leto governs as a benevolent tyrant, providing for his people&#x27;s physical needs, but denying them any spiritual outlets other than his compulsory religion (as well as maintaining a monopoly on spice and thus total control of its use). Personal violence is banned, as is nearly all space travel, creating a pent-up demand for freedom and travel. The Bene Gesserit, Ixians, and Tleilaxu seek ways to regain some of their former power or unseat Leto altogether. Leto also conducts his selective breeding program among the descendants of his twin sister Ghanima, finally arriving at Siona, daughter of Moneo, whose actions are hidden from prescient vision. Leto engineers his own assassination, knowing it will result in rebellion and revolt but also in an explosion in travel and colonization. The death of Leto&#x27;s body also produces new sandtrout, which will eventually give rise to a population of sandworms and a new cycle of spice production.

===The return from the Scattering===

In the aftermath of the fall of the God Emperor, chaos and severe famine in many worlds caused trillions of humans to set off into the freedom of unknown space and spread out across the universe. This diaspora is later called the Scattering and, combined with the invisibility of Atreides descendants to prescient vision, assures that humanity has forever escaped the threat of total extinction. At the time of &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;&quot; (1985)—1500 years after Leto&#x27;s death—the turmoil is settling into a new pattern; the balance of power in the Old Empire, as it is now called, rests among the Ixians, the Bene Gesserit, and the Tleilaxu. The Spacing Guild has been forever weakened by the development of Ixian machines capable of navigation in foldspace, practically replacing Guild Navigators. The Bene Gesserit, through manipulation of the Priesthood of the Divided God, control the sandworms and their planet, now called Rakis, but the Tleilaxu have discovered how to produce melange using their axlotl tanks in quantities that greatly exceed natural melange harvests. This balance of power is shattered by a large influx of people from the Scattering, some fleeing persecution by an as-yet-unknown enemy. Among the returning people, the Bene Gesserit finds its match in a violent and corrupt matriarchal society known as the Honored Matres, who they suspect may be descended from some of their own sent out in the Scattering. As a bitter and bloody war erupts between the orders, it ultimately becomes clear that joining the two organizations into a single New Sisterhood with shared abilities is their best chance to fight the approaching enemy.

The sequels &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson complete the original series and wrap up storylines that began with &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;.

==Development and publication==

===Original series===
Herbert&#x27;s interest in the desert setting of &quot;Dune&quot; and its challenges is attributed to research he began in 1957 for a never-completed article about a United States Department of Agriculture experiment using poverty grass to stabilize damaging sand dunes, which could &quot;swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, and highways.&quot; Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising what would eventually become the novel &quot;Dune&quot;, which was initially serialized in &quot;Analog&quot; magazine as two shorter works, &quot;Dune World&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Prophet of Dune&quot; (1965). The serialized version was expanded and reworked—and rejected by more than 20 publishers—before being published by Chilton Books, a printing house best known for its auto repair manuals, in 1965. &quot;Dune&quot; won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966, and the 1966 Hugo Award. The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies. &quot;Dune&quot; has been regularly cited as one of the world&#x27;s best-selling science fiction novels.

A sequel, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, followed in 1969. A third novel called &quot;Children of Dune&quot; was published in 1976, and was later nominated for a Hugo Award. &quot;Children of Dune&quot; became the first hardcover best-seller ever in the science fiction field. Parts of these two first sequels were written before &quot;Dune&quot; was completed.

In 1978, Putnam published &quot;The Illustrated Dune&quot;, an edition of &quot;Dune&quot; with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and eight full color paintings by John Schoenherr, who had done the cover art for the first printing of &quot;Dune&quot; and had illustrated the &quot;Analog&quot; serializations of &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.

In 1981, Herbert released &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, which was ranked as the #11 hardcover fiction best seller of 1981 by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, the 1984 &quot;New York Times&quot; #13 hardcover fiction best seller, was followed in quick succession by &quot;&quot; in 1985. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.

===Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson===

Over a decade after Herbert&#x27;s death, his son Brian Herbert enlisted science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to coauthor a trilogy of &quot;Dune&quot; prequel novels that would come to be called the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; series. Using some of Frank Herbert&#x27;s own notes, the duo wrote &quot;&quot; (1999), &quot;&quot; (2000), and &quot;&quot; (2001). The series is set in the years immediately prior to the events of &quot;Dune&quot;. This was followed with a second prequel trilogy called the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot;, consisting of &quot;&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2003), and &quot;&quot; (2004). These were set during the Butlerian Jihad, an element of backstory that Frank Herbert had previously established as occurring 10,000 years before the events chronicled in &quot;Dune&quot;. Herbert&#x27;s brief description of humanity&#x27;s &quot;crusade against computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots&quot; was expanded by Brian Herbert and Anderson in this series.

With an outline for the first book of &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; series written and a proposal sent to publishers, Brian Herbert had discovered his father&#x27;s 30-page outline for a sequel to &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;, which the elder Herbert had dubbed &quot;Dune 7&quot;. After publishing their six prequel novels, Brian Herbert and Anderson released &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), which complete the original series and wrap up storylines that began with Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;.

The &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; series followed, focusing on the time periods between Frank Herbert&#x27;s original novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;4/14/2008 blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first book, &quot;Paul of Dune&quot;, was published in 2008, followed by &quot;The Winds of Dune&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;4/23/07 blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009. The next two installments were to be called &quot;The Throne of Dune&quot; and &quot;Leto of Dune&quot; (possibly changing to &quot;The Golden Path of Dune&quot;), but were postponed due to plans to publish a trilogy, &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot;, about &quot;the formation of the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, the Suk doctors, the Spacing Guild and the Navigators, as well as the solidifying of the Corrino Imperium.&quot; &quot;Sisterhood of Dune&quot; was released in 2012, followed by &quot;Mentats of Dune&quot; in 2014. In a 2009 interview, Anderson stated that the third and final novel would be titled &quot;The Swordmasters of Dune&quot;, but by 2014 it had been renamed &quot;Navigators of Dune&quot;. The novel was published on September 13, 2016. A third &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; novel, &quot;Princess of Dune&quot;, was released on October 3, 2023.

In July 2020, Herbert and Anderson announced a new trilogy of prequel novels called &quot;The Caladan Trilogy&quot;. The first novel in the series, &quot;&quot;, was published in October 2020, and the second, &quot;&quot;, was released in September 2021. The third novel, &quot;&quot;, was released on November 22, 2022.

===Short stories===

In 1985, Frank Herbert wrote an illustrated short work called &quot;The Road to Dune&quot;, set sometime between the events of &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. Published in Herbert&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Eye&quot;, it takes the form of a guidebook for pilgrims to Arrakis and features images (with descriptions) of some of the devices and characters presented in the novels.

Brian Herbert and Anderson have written eight &quot;Dune&quot; short stories and four &quot;Dune&quot; novellas, most of them related to and published around their novels. The eight short stories include &quot;&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2003), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2008), and &quot;&quot; (2016). These eight short stories were published together in the 2017 collection &quot;Tales of Dune: Expanded Edition&quot;. The four novellas include &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;Dune: Blood of the Sardaukar&quot; (2019), &quot;&quot; (2022), and &quot;&quot; (2022). The four novellas were published together in the collection &quot;Sands of Dune&quot;, which released on July 28, 2022.

==By other authors==
In 1984, Herbert&#x27;s publisher Putnam released &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot;. Approved by Herbert but not written by him, this collection of essays by 43 contributors describes in invented detail many aspects of the &quot;Dune&quot; universe not found in the novels themselves. Herbert&#x27;s estate later confirmed its non-canonical status after Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson had begun publishing prequel novels that directly contradict &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot;. The 1984 &quot;Dune&quot; film spawned &quot;The Dune Storybook&quot; (September 1984, ), a novelization written by Joan D. Vinge, and &quot;The Making of Dune&quot; (December 1984, ), a making-of book by Ed Naha.

In May 1992, Ace Books published &quot;Songs of Muad&#x27;Dib&quot; (), a collection of &quot;Dune&quot;-related poems written by Frank Herbert and edited by his son Brian. Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson released &quot;The Road to Dune&quot; on August 11, 2005. The book contains a novelette called &quot;Spice Planet&quot; (an alternative version of &quot;Dune&quot; based on an outline by Frank Herbert), a number of the Brian Herbert/Anderson short stories, and letters and unused chapters written by Frank Herbert. In the 1999 gazetteer &quot;The Stars and Planets of Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune: A Gazetteer&quot; (1999), Joseph M. Daniels estimates the distance from Earth in light-years (ly) for many &quot;Dune&quot; planets, based on the real-life distances of the stars and planetary systems referenced by Frank Herbert when discussing these planets in the glossary of the novel &quot;Dune&quot;. Though Herbert used the names of actual stars and planetary systems in his work, there is no documentation supporting or disputing the assumption that he was, in fact, referring to these real-life stars or systems.

&quot;The Science of Dune&quot; (2008) analyzes and deconstructs many of Herbert&#x27;s concepts and fictional inventions.

==Themes and influences==
The &quot;Dune&quot; series is a landmark of soft science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his &quot;Dune&quot; universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity&#x27;s technology. &quot;Dune&quot; considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time. Jon Michaud of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the originating novel &quot;Dune&quot; &quot;an epic of political betrayal, ecological brinkmanship, and messianic deliverance.&quot; Director John Harrison, who adapted &quot;Dune&quot; for Syfy&#x27;s 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of &quot;the human condition and its moral dilemmas&quot;, and said:
Novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, explained that &quot;Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren&#x27;t so different from systems we know.&quot; He wrote that the invaluable drug melange &quot;represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil&quot;. Michaud explained, &quot;Imagine a substance with the combined worldwide value of cocaine and petroleum and you will have some idea of the power of melange.&quot; Each chapter of &quot;Dune&quot; begins with an epigraph excerpted from the fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context, and other details intended by Herbert to enhance understanding of his complex fictional universe and themes.

Michaud wrote in 2013, &quot;With daily reminders of the intensifying effects of global warming, the spectre of a worldwide water shortage, and continued political upheaval in the oil-rich Middle East, it is possible that &quot;Dune&quot; is even more relevant now than when it was first published.&quot; Praising Herbert&#x27;s &quot;clever authorial decision&quot; to excise robots and computers (&quot;two staples of the genre&quot;) from his fictional universe, he suggested that &quot;This de-emphasis on technology throws the focus back on people. It also allows for the presence of a religious mysticism uncommon in science fiction.&quot;

===Environmentalism and ecology===
The originating novel &quot;Dune&quot; has been called the &quot;first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale&quot;. After the publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. &quot;Dune&quot; responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of life on Arrakis, from giant sandworms (for whom water is life-threatening) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited water. &quot;Dune&quot; was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as &quot;A Door into Ocean&quot; (1986) and &quot;Red Mars&quot; (1992). Environmentalists have pointed out that &quot;Dune&quot; popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex, almost living, thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international Earth Day.

===Declining empires===
Lorenzo DiTommaso compared &quot;Dune&quot; portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, which argues that Christianity allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of Ancient Rome. In &quot;History and Historical Effect in Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;&quot; (1992), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as &quot;parasites&quot;. The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt, materially indulgent, and a sexual degenerate. Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack.

Similarly, the Emperor&#x27;s Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Arrakis because of the Sardaukar&#x27;s overconfidence and the Fremen&#x27;s capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others. The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Herbert as depicting &quot;war as a collective orgasm&quot; (drawing on Norman Walter&#x27;s 1950 &quot;The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare&quot;). These themes reappear in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; Scattering and Leto II Atreides&#x27;s all-female Fish Speaker army.

===Heroism===
Brian Herbert wrote that &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange...[that] resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs.&quot;

Paul&#x27;s rise to superhuman status follows the hero&#x27;s journey template; after unfortunate circumstances are forced onto him, he suffers a long period of hardship and exile, and finally confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. As such, &quot;Dune&quot; is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means. Frank Herbert said in 1979, &quot;The bottom line of the &quot;Dune&quot; trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.&quot; He wrote in 1985, &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader&#x27;s name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.&quot;

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul&#x27;s superpowers, differentiating the heroes of &quot;Dune&quot; from earlier heroes such as Superman, van Vogt&#x27;s Gilbert Gosseyn and Henry Kuttner&#x27;s telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul&#x27;s are the result of &quot;painful and slow personal progress.&quot; And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert&#x27;s characters grow their powers through &quot;the application of mystical philosophies and techniques.&quot; For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Swordmasters of Ginaz and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).

===Middle-Eastern and Islamic influences===
Due to the similarities between some of Herbert&#x27;s terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in Arabic, as well as the series&#x27; &quot;Islamic undertones&quot; and themes, a Middle Eastern influence on Herbert&#x27;s works has been noted repeatedly.

As a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides&#x27; character bears many similarities to the historical T. E. Lawrence, whose 1962 biopic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; has also been identified as an influence. Lesley Blanch&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sabres of Paradise&quot; (1960) about Muslim resistance to the Russian conquest of the Caucasus, has also been identified as a major influence upon &quot;Dune&quot;, with its depiction of Imam Shamil, the Caucasian Imamate, and the Islamic culture of the Caucasus inspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology of &quot;Dune&quot;. Multiple proverbs recorded by Blanch&#x27;s &quot;The Sabres&quot; as originating from the Caucasus Mountains are included in &quot;Dune&quot;, such as &quot;polish comes from the city, wisdom from the hills,&quot; becoming &quot;polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert&quot; for Arrakis.

The environment of the desert planet Arrakis is similar to the Middle East, particularly the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf, as well as to Mexico. The novel also contains references to the petroleum industries in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf as well as Mexico. The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology. Inspiration is also adopted from medieval historian ibn Khaldun&#x27;s cyclical history and his dynastic concept in North Africa, hinted by Herbert&#x27;s reference to ibn Khaldun&#x27;s book &quot;Kitāb al-ʿIbar&quot; &quot;The Book of Lessons&quot; as known among the Fremen.

==== Additional linguistic and historic influences ====
In addition to Arabic, &quot;Dune&quot; derives words and names from multiple other languages, including Hebrew, Navajo, Latin, Chakobsa, the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs, Greek, Persian, East Indian, Russian, Turkish, Finnish, Dutch and Old English. Herbert created a fictional language, also called Chakobsa, used by the Fremen on Arrakis for rituals and other purposes. Through the inspiration from Lesley Blanch&#x27;s &quot;The Sabres of Paradise&quot;, there are also allusions to the Tsarist-era Russian nobility and Cossacks. Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the aristocratic families in &quot;Dune&quot; was &quot;aristocratic bureaucracy&quot; which he saw as analogous to the Soviet Union.

===Religion===

Brian Herbert called the &quot;Dune&quot; universe &quot;a spiritual melting pot&quot;, noting that his father, Frank Herbert, incorporated elements of a variety of religions, including Buddhism, Sufi mysticism and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism. He added that Frank Herbert&#x27;s fictional future in which &quot;religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms&quot; represents the author&#x27;s solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claim to have &quot;the one and only revelation.&quot; Frank Herbert writes that, in the aftermath of the technology-purging Butlerian Jihad, the Bene Gesserit composed the Azhar Book, which &quot;preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths&quot;. Soon after, an ecumenical council created a syncretic religion defined by the Orange Catholic Bible, which would become the primary orthodox religious text in the universe. Its title suggests a merging of Protestantism (Orange Order) and Catholicism. Herbert writes in the glossary of &quot;Dune&quot;:
Early in his newspaper career, Frank Herbert was introduced to Zen, a school of Mahayana Buddhism, by two Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who &quot;gave a crucial boost to his thinking&quot;. Zen teachings ultimately had &quot;a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert&#x27;s] work&quot;. Throughout the &quot;Dune&quot; series and particularly in &quot;Dune&quot;, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism. The Fremen are Zensunni adherents, and many of Herbert&#x27;s epigraphs are Zen-spirited. In &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; Genesis&quot;, Frank Herbert wrote:
The Bene Gesserit practice &quot;religious engineering&quot; (social engineering), through the Missionaria Protectiva, which spreads contrived myths, prophecies and superstition on primitive worlds so that the Sisterhood may at a much later time exploit embedded belief to advance their universal strategies. Herbert suggests a process of wish-fulfilling recognition of &quot;sacred&quot; texts created by the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s master plan in a particular person, and transforming events into common belief. In the novels, the Fremen religion on Arrakis has been thus influenced, allowing Paul to embody their prophesied messiah. Paul is agonized by visions of terrible jihad which will destroy the Imperium, but he becomes Paul Muad&#x27;Dib, Mahdi of the Fremen, accepting the role imposed by Bene Gesserit. A new religion sweeps Paul to power.

Between the events of &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, the name Muad&#x27;Dib becomes a battle cry on the lips of the Fremen army that sweeps across the universe in a jihad in the name of Muad&#x27;Dib&#x27;s religion. The population of the universe sees Muad&#x27;Dib as their god, whether they like it or not, and they cannot deny his power religiously. The Fremen culture is irreparably damaged by jihad; the new religion takes shape of rituals that are dependent on Muad&#x27;Dib&#x27;s omnipresence. As Muad&#x27;Dib, Paul is the messiah and the Emperor (King of Kings) who gives himself to fate and becomes a martyr to his followers, wanders blinded into the desert to die, later finding emancipation as a heretic of his own church as the Preacher. The regency of Paul&#x27;s sister Alia and the Qizarate priests continue to promote Muad&#x27;Dib&#x27;s religion to help keep control of the universe, ensuring that others do not oppose them. In his Golden Path, Herbert presents an argument of how to create a healthy society, avoiding despotism and hero worship, a trap in which social groups can be caught:
==Legacy==
The political, scientific, and social fictional setting of Herbert&#x27;s novels and derivative works is known as the &quot;Dune&quot; universe or Duniverse. &quot;Dune&quot; has been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music, films, television, games, and comic books. It is considered one of the greatest and most influential science fiction novels of all time, with numerous modern science fiction works such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; owing their existence to &quot;Dune&quot;. &quot;Dune&quot; has also been referenced in numerous other works of popular culture, such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;, &quot;The Kingkiller Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;Futurama&quot;. &quot;Dune&quot; was cited as the prime inspiration for Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s manga, and later film, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1982–1994).

Jon Michaud noted in 2013 in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s curious about &quot;Dune&quot; stature is that it has not penetrated popular culture in the way that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; have.&quot; He praised Herbert&#x27;s &quot;clever authorial decision&quot; to excise robots and computers (&quot;two staples of the genre&quot;) from his fictional universe, but suggested that this may be one explanation why &quot;Dune&quot; lacks &quot;true fandom among science-fiction fans&quot;.

Since 2009, the names of planets from the &quot;Dune&quot; novels have been adopted for the real-world nomenclature of plains (planitiae) and complexes of valleys (labyrinthi) on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. Planet names used to date include Arrakis, Caladan, Giedi Prime, Kaitain, Salusa Secundus, and Tleilax. The Hagal dune field and other sites on Mars are informally named after planets mentioned in the &quot;Dune&quot; series. The city of Tacoma, Washington, Herbert&#x27;s birthplace, dedicated part of Point Defiance Park as the &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; Peninsula&quot; to honor the writer and the series.

==In other media==

===Films===

In 1973, director and writer Alejandro Jodorowsky set about creating a cinematic adaptation, taking over the option that producer Arthur P. Jacobs had taken on the film adaptation rights in 1973 shortly before his death. Jodorowsky approached, among others, Peter Gabriel, the prog rock groups Pink Floyd and Magma for some of the music, artists H. R. Giger and Jean Giraud for set and character design, and Dan O&#x27;Bannon for special effects. Jodorowsky cast his own son Brontis Jodorowsky in the lead role of Paul Atreides, Salvador Dalí as Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor, Amanda Lear as Princess Irulan, Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Gloria Swanson as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, David Carradine as Duke Leto Atreides, Geraldine Chaplin as Lady Jessica, Alain Delon as Duncan Idaho, Hervé Villechaize as Gurney Halleck, Udo Kier as Piter De Vries, and Mick Jagger as Feyd-Rautha. He began writing a vast script, so expansive that the film was thought to potentially last 14 hours. The project was scrapped for financial reasons, leaving Jodorowsky&#x27;s unfinished handwritten script in a notebook that was partially published as a facsimile in 2012 as part of the &quot;100 Notes – 100 Thoughts&quot; catalog of the 13th &quot;documenta&quot; exhibition. Frank Pavich directed a documentary about this unrealized project entitled &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;, which premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival in May 2013, and was released theatrically in March 2014.

In 1984, Dino De Laurentiis and Universal Pictures released &quot;Dune&quot;, a feature film adaptation of the novel by director and writer David Lynch. The film stars Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides, Jürgen Prochnow as Duke Leto Atreides, Francesca Annis as Lady Jessica, Sean Young as Chani, Kenneth McMillan as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Siân Phillips as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Max von Sydow as Doctor Kynes, Sting as Feyd-Rautha, Freddie Jones as Thufir Hawat, Richard Jordan as Duncan Idaho, Everett McGill as Stilgar, Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck, Dean Stockwell as Doctor Wellington Yueh, and José Ferrer as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Although a commercial and critical failure upon release, Frank Herbert himself was reportedly pleased with the film, as it stayed more faithful to the book than earlier film adaptation attempts. However, he had his reservations on its failures at the time, citing the lack of &quot;imagination&quot; in its marketing and estimated costs, and some of the filmmaker&#x27;s production techniques. In 2021, Ballyhoo Motion Pictures released a documentary entitled &quot;The Sleeper Must Awaken: Making Dune&quot;. It chronicles the making of Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; film. Initially intended to be released on a special feature for the Arrow Films&#x27; &quot;Dune&quot; disc release, it was later released on their paid streaming service Arrow Player. 

In 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that it had a new feature film adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot; in development with Peter Berg set to direct; Berg dropped out of the project in October 2009, and director Pierre Morel was signed in January 2010. Paramount dropped the project in March 2011.

In November 2016, Legendary Pictures acquired the film and TV rights for &quot;Dune&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; reported in December 2016 that Denis Villeneuve was in negotiations to direct &quot;Dune&quot;, which was confirmed in February 2017. In early 2018, Villeneuve stated that his goal was to adapt the novel into a two-part film series. He said in May 2018 that the first draft of the script had been finished. In July 2018, Brian Herbert confirmed that the latest draft of the screenplay covered &quot;approximately half of the novel &quot;Dune&quot;.&quot; Timothée Chalamet was cast to play Paul Atreides. Greig Fraser joined the project as cinematographer in December 2018. In September 2018, it was reported that Rebecca Ferguson was in talks to play Jessica Atreides. In January 2019, Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård joined the production, playing Glossu Rabban and Vladimir Harkonnen, respectively. It was reported later that month that Charlotte Rampling had been cast as Reverend Mother Mohiam, Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto, Zendaya as Chani, and Javier Bardem as Stilgar. In February 2019, Josh Brolin was cast as Gurney Halleck, Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho, and David Dastmalchian as Piter De Vries. Filming began March 18, 2019, and the film was shot on location in Budapest, Hungary and Jordan. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; was released on October 22, 2021. &quot;Dune&quot; was a critical and commercial success, leading Legendary Pictures to greenlight a sequel, &quot;&quot;, within that week. The film was released on March 1, 2024.

Prior to the release of &quot;Dune&quot;, Villeneuve confirmed at the 2021 Venice Film Festival that a film based on &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; was planned, and it would serve as the third film in a trilogy. After &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot; was officially greenlit in October 2021, Villeneuve reiterated his hope to continue the series with a third film focusing on &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. Screenwriter Jon Spaihts confirmed in March 2022 that Villeneuve still planned on a third film. Villeneuve began writing a script for a &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; film in 2023. In February 2024, he said the script was &quot;almost finished&quot; but also wanted to take time to ensure his satisfaction, citing Hollywood&#x27;s tendency of focusing on release dates over a film&#x27;s overall quality. In April 2024, following the critical and commercial success of &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot;, Legendary Pictures confirmed that &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; was in development with Villeneuve returning as director.

===Television series ===
The Sci-Fi Channel premiered a three-part miniseries adaptation called &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; on December 3, 2000. Its March 16, 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, combined both &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. As of 2004, both miniseries were two of the three highest-rated programs ever to be broadcast on Syfy. &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; won two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001, for Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or Movie and Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. The miniseries was also nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot; won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special in 2003. The miniseries was also nominated for Emmys for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special, Outstanding Hairstyling for a Limited Series or Movie, and Outstanding Makeup for a Limited Series or Movie (Non-Prosthetic).

In June 2019 it was announced that Legendary Television would be producing a spin-off television series, &quot;&quot;, for WarnerMedia&#x27;s streaming service, HBO Max. The series would focus on the Bene Gesserit and serve as a prequel to the 2021 film. Villeneuve was set to direct the series&#x27; pilot with Jon Spaihts writing the screenplay, and both would serve as executive producers alongside Brian Herbert. Though he initially served as showrunner, on November 5, 2019, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Spaihts had stepped down from this position to focus more on the sequel to the 2021 film. Diane Ademu-John had been hired as the new showrunner by July 2021. The series was retitled &quot;Dune: Prophecy&quot; in November 2023, and was moved to HBO in July 2024, and was set to premiere later that year. The series was released on November 17, 2024.

===Comics and graphic novels===
A comic adaptation of David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Dune&quot;, by writer Ralph Macchio and artist Bill Sienkiewicz, was produced by Marvel Comics and was published in various formats. On December 1, 1984, it was published with Berkley in a small paperback as &quot;Dune: The Official Comic Book&quot; (). It was later released as &quot;Marvel Super Special #36: Dune&quot; on April 1, 1985, and as a three-issue limited comic series from Marvel entitled &quot;Dune&quot; from April to June 1985.

In January 2020, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that Abrams Books was developing a three-part graphic novel adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;, which was the first time the novel has been published in this format. The graphic novel was written by Brian Herbert and Anderson and illustrated by Raúl Allén and Patricia Martín, with covers by Bill and was published on November 24, 2020. Sienkiewicz. In May 2020, Boom! Studios was announced to have acquired the comic and graphic novel rights to the 1999 prequel novel &quot;&quot;, with the intent of doing a 12-issue comic adaptation written by the original authors Brian Herbert and Anderson. In 2021 they announced another 12-issue comic series based on Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s 2019 short story &quot;Blood of the Sardaukar.&quot; In 2022, Dune: The Graphic Novel, Book 2: Muad’Dib, was published on July 5, 2022.

===Video games===

Six licensed &quot;Dune&quot; computer and video games have been released. The first was &quot;Dune&quot; (1992) developed by Cryo Interactive. Another game developed at the same time, Westwood Studios&#x27; &quot;Dune II&quot; (1992), is generally credited for popularizing and setting the template for the real-time strategy genre of computer games. &quot;Dune II&quot; is considered to be among the most influential video games of all time.

&quot;Dune 2000&quot; (1998) is a remake of &quot;Dune II&quot; from Intelligent Games. Its sequel was the 3D video game &quot;&quot; (2001) by Intelligent Games/Westwood Studios/Electronic Arts. The 3D game &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; (2001) by Cryo Interactive/DreamCatcher Interactive is based on the 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries of the same name.

On February 26, 2019, Funcom announced that it was entering into an exclusive partnership with Legendary Pictures to develop games related to the upcoming &quot;Dune&quot; films. The first game, &quot;&quot;, developed by Shiro Games, was released in early access on April 26, 2022.

In January 2022, characters from both &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; parodies of &quot;Dune&quot; (in particular Paul Atreides-themed versions of Morty Smith) were made available as playable characters in the franchise video game &quot;Pocket Mortys&quot;.

===Other games===

The board game &quot;Dune&quot; was released by Avalon Hill in 1979, followed by a Parker Brothers game &quot;Dune&quot; in 1984. A 1997 collectible card game called &quot;Dune&quot; was followed by the role-playing game &quot;&quot; in 2000. The 1979 Avalon Hill game was republished by Gale Force Nine in 2019. The board game &quot;&quot; was published by Dire Wolf in 2021. In May 2021, a tabletop RPG, &quot;Dune: Adventures in the Imperium,&quot; was released by Modiphius Entertainment.

<text>Gowalia Tank [[Maidan]], officially renamed August Kranti Maidan, is a park in Grant Road West, in South Mumbai, in which Mahatma Gandhi issued the Quit India speech on 8 August 1942. It decreed that unless the British left India immediately, mass agitations would take place.

==History==
On August 7, 1942, the All India Congress Committee organized its session under the Presidentship of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, which continued past-midnight into the next day. The venue was the Gowalia Tank Maidan, which was located 250 metres away from Goculdas Tejpal House, the place where the Indian National Congress was established in December 1885. The next day (August 8. 1942), the call for &quot;Quit India Movement&quot; was given, with the mantra of &quot;do or die.&quot;

In the words of Gandhi &quot;Here is a mantra, a short one, that I give you. You may imprint it on your hearts and let every breath of yours give expression to it. The mantra is: &quot;Do or Die&quot;. We shall either free India or die in the attempt; we shall not live to see the perpetuation of our slavery&quot;. The call mobilised the citizens to a huge Civil Disobedience movement as the British refused to grant independence till the Second World War  (1939 to 1945) was over.

==Origin of the name==
The Gowalia Tank was initially used to bathe cows. &quot;Go - Walia&quot; comes from the marathi/Gujarati word &quot;Gaie&quot; (cow) &quot;Wala&quot; (owner of the cattle). The cattle owners would bring the cows to be bathed in the waters of the tank. The Maidan that exists over there presently was built over the tank, which still exists underground. Gowalia Tank was also a very prominent tram terminus. Trams would start and finish there and one could travel to the Prince of Wales Museum in one anna (six paise).

==Current usage==
The Maidan is now a popular playground. Cricket is the popular game although the monsoon season is primarily for football and volleyball. The ground has been split into 5 smaller grounds. The largest one is the playground, with one playground for children, one garden for promenades which is frequented by senior citizens and one ground is used by the Fellowship School. The last park area houses the Smarak or martyr monument which is a white marble tower that cradles a pink lotus atop it.

A central road cuts through the maidan grounds and connects the August Kranti Road with Hughes Road. The ground connects Tejpal Road and Laburnum Road, Alexandra Road and August Kranti Road.

The closest suburban railway station on the Western Railway line is Grant Road. The August Kranti Rajdhani Express, connecting Mumbai to New Delhi, was named after this maidan.

<doc id="907894" wikidata="Q5182895" url="?curid=907894" title="Crawford Market">
<text>Crawford Market (officially Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Mandai) is one of South Mumbai&#x27;s most famous markets. The building was completed in 1869, and donated to the city by Cowasji Jehangir. Originally named after Arthur Crawford, the first Municipal Commissioner of the city, the market was later renamed to honour Indian social reformer Mahatma Jotirao Phule. The market is situated opposite the Mumbai Police headquarters, just north of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station and west of the J.J. flyover at a busy intersection. It was the main wholesale market for fruits in Mumbai until March 1996, when the wholesale traders were relocated to Navi Mumbai.

In 1882, the building was the first in India to be lit up by electricity.

==Architecture==

The market was designed by British architect William Emerson, and represented an early effort to blend Victorian Gothic architecture with indigenous elements. The market covers an area of 22,471 sq m (2,41,877 sq ft), of which 5,515 sq m (59,363 sq ft) is occupied by the building itself. The structure was built using coarse buff coloured Kurla stone, with redstone from Bassein. It has a 15 m high skylight awning designed to allow the sunlight to brighten up the marketplace.

The original design consisted of three doorways at the entrance, each divided with a column, with space for a carved panel depicting everyday life. Two such panels were carved by the artist, John Lockwood Kipling (the father of author Rudyard Kipling) depicting an image of workers working, but he was not able to complete the third before leaving India. 

==Timing==
This market is mostly closed on Sundays. On other days, it&#x27;s open from 11:00 am to 8:00 pm.

==Items sold==
The market houses numerous items, from wholesale fruits, vegetables and poultry to clothes, dress materials, toys, jewelry, and even a pet store. At the pet area, different varieties of dogs, cats, and birds can be found. There have also been stories of the illegal sale of endangered species. 

==Reaching there==
Crawford market area can be reached by taking local trains from Masjid Railway Station, or local buses and cabs.

<text>The International Gymnastics Federation (French: &quot;Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique&quot;, abbr. FIG) is the body governing competition in all disciplines of gymnastics. Its headquarters is in Lausanne, Switzerland. It was founded on 23 July 1881 in Liège, Belgium, making it the world&#x27;s oldest existing international sports organisation. Originally called the European Federation of Gymnastics, it had three member countries—Belgium, France and the Netherlands—until 1921, when non-European countries were admitted and it received its current name.

The federation sets the rules, known as the Code of Points, that regulate how gymnasts&#x27; performances are evaluated. Seven gymnastics disciplines are governed by the FIG: artistic gymnastics, further classified as men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics and women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics; rhythmic gymnastics; aerobic gymnastics; acrobatic gymnastics; trampolining; double mini trampoline, tumbling and parkour. Additionally, the federation is responsible for determining gymnasts&#x27; age eligibility to participate in the Olympics.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIG barred Russian athletes and officials, including judges. It also announced that &quot;all FIG World Cup and World Challenge Cup events planned to take place in Russia ... are cancelled, and no other FIG events will be allocated to Russia ... until further notice.&quot; FIG also banned the Russian flag at its events. In 19 July 2023, FIG decided to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes and support personnels to participant events under individual neutral athletes.

==Organization==
The main governing bodies of the federation are the president and vice presidents, the Congress held every two years, the Executive Committee, the Council, and technical committees for each of the disciplines.

In 2023, there were 161 national federations affiliated with FIG, one of which have been suspended, as well as one associated federation, one provisional federation and the following five continental unions:
* European Union of Gymnastics (UEG)
* Pan-American Gymnastic Union (PAGU)
* Asian Gymnastic Union (AGU)
* African Gymnastics Union (UAG)
* Oceania Gymnastics Union (OGU)

Across all disciplines, participation in FIG-sanctioned events exceeds 30,000 athletes, about 70% of whom are female.

===Presidents, and their tenures, of the FIG===
Morinari Watanabe was elected president of the organization since 2017.

==Competitions==
According to the technical regulations of the International Gymnastcs Federation, the competitions officially organized by FIG are:

<text>Kristina Ulrika Marianne Nordenstam (born 4 March 1969), better known by her stage name Stina Nordenstam, is a Swedish singer-songwriter and producer. She is perhaps best known for her song &quot;Little Star&quot;, which appears in the Baz Luhrman film Romeo + Juliet.

==Life and career==
Nordenstam was born in Stockholm on 4 March 1969. As a child, she was highly influenced by her father&#x27;s classical and jazz music collection. Her debut album, &quot;Memories of a Color&quot;, was released in 1991. Her album &quot;And She Closed Her Eyes&quot; was released in 1994, and was named the best Swedish album of all time by &quot;Sonic&quot; on their 2013 list of the 100 best Swedish albums. 1997&#x27;s &quot;Dynamite&quot; began a more experimental path—most of the album was filled with distorted guitars and unusual beats. A 1998 cover album, &quot;People Are Strange&quot;, followed in the same vein. In 2001, Nordenstam went with a more pop-influenced sound on &quot;This Is Stina Nordenstam&quot;, which features guest vocals from Brett Anderson. Nordenstam&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;The World Is Saved&quot; continued the path set on &quot;This Is...&quot;, and is her last album .

She appears on two songs by English band Nine Horses, on the album &quot;Snow Borne Sorrow&quot; and on the EP &quot;Money for All&quot;. She also provided vocals for Vangelis&#x27; song &quot;Ask the Mountains&quot;, Yello&#x27;s &quot;To the Sea&quot;, and a collaboration with Anton Fier. In 2000, Nordenstam featured on a track from Danish prog-rockers Mew&#x27;s second album &quot;Half the World Is Watching Me&quot;. The track was later re-recorded for the band&#x27;s international debut &quot;Frengers&quot;. Nordenstam&#x27;s vocals on her track &quot;A Walk in the Park&quot; were used as a sample for two songs by the Canadian electronic duo Crystal Castles, &quot;Violent Dreams&quot; and &quot;Vietnam&quot;.

Nordenstam presented a sound installation at the Way Out West music festival in 2013, and, in 2014, Nordenstam was one of 12 inaugural inductees into the Swedish Music Hall of Fame.

Nordenstam is autistic.

==Musical style==
Nordenstam&#x27;s voice was called &quot;delicate&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, and &quot;plucky&quot; by &quot;Autostraddle&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; described Nordenstam&#x27;s voice as &quot;childlike&quot; with &quot;hushed and fragile&quot; tones and a &quot;soft and gentle&quot; timbre, contrasting it with her &quot;mighty and immeasurable&quot; sound. Her voice was described by Adam Brent Houghtaling, author of &quot;This Will End in Tears: The Miserablist Guide to Music&quot;, as &quot;very fragile&quot; and &quot;wispy&quot;, and he stated that her music &quot;melds a lot of jazz and folk and ambient pop all together&quot;. Her music has also been described as avant-pop. Sally Shapiro has listed Nordenstam as an influence on her music.

<doc id="907899" wikidata="Q174443" url="?curid=907899" title="X-ray tube">
<text>An X-ray tube is a vacuum tube that converts electrical input power into X-rays. The availability of this controllable source of X-rays created the field of radiography, the imaging of partly opaque objects with penetrating radiation. In contrast to other sources of ionizing radiation, X-rays are only produced as long as the X-ray tube is energized. X-ray tubes are also used in CT scanners, airport luggage scanners, X-ray crystallography, material and structure analysis, and for industrial inspection.

Increasing demand for high-performance computed tomography (CT) scanning and angiography systems has driven development of very high-performance medical X-ray tubes.

==History==
X-ray tubes evolved from experimental Crookes tubes with which X-rays were first discovered on November 8, 1895, by the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. The first-generation &quot;cold cathode&quot; or &quot;Crookes&quot; X-ray tubes were used until the 1920s. These tubes work by ionisation of residual gas within the tube. The positive ions bombard the cathode of the tube to release electrons, which are accelerated toward the anode and produce X-rays when they strike it. The Crookes tube was improved by William Coolidge in 1913. The &quot;Coolidge&quot; tube, also called a &quot;hot cathode&quot; tube, uses thermionic emission, where a tungsten cathode is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to emit electrons, which are then accelerated toward the anode in a near perfect vacuum.

Until the late 1980s, X-ray generators were merely high-voltage, AC to DC variable power supplies. In the late 1980s a different method of control was emerging, called high-speed switching. This followed the electronics technology of switching power supplies (aka switch mode power supply), and allowed for more accurate control of the X-ray unit, higher quality results and reduced X-ray exposures.

==Physics==

As with any vacuum tube, there is a cathode, which emits electrons into the vacuum and an anode to collect the electrons, thus establishing a flow of electrical current, known as the beam, through the tube. A high voltage power source, for example 30 to 150 kilovolts (kV), called the &quot;tube voltage&quot;, is connected across cathode and anode to accelerate the electrons. The X-ray spectrum depends on the anode material and the accelerating voltage.

Electrons from the cathode collide with the anode material, usually tungsten, molybdenum or copper, and accelerate other electrons, ions and nuclei within the anode material. About 1% of the energy generated is emitted/radiated, usually perpendicular to the path of the electron beam, as X-rays. The rest of the energy is released as heat. Over time, tungsten will be deposited from the target onto the interior surface of the tube, including the glass surface. This will slowly darken the tube and was thought to degrade the quality of the X-ray beam. Vaporized tungsten condenses on the inside of the envelope over the &quot;window&quot; and thus acts as an additional filter and decreases the tube&#x27;s ability to radiate heat. Eventually, the tungsten deposit may become sufficiently conductive that at high enough voltages, arcing occurs. The arc will jump from the cathode to the tungsten deposit, and then to the anode. This arcing causes an effect called &quot;crazing&quot; on the interior glass of the X-ray window. With time, the tube becomes unstable even at lower voltages and must be replaced. At this point, the tube assembly (also called the &quot;tube head&quot;) is removed from the X-ray system, and replaced with a new tube assembly. The old tube assembly is shipped to a company that reloads it with a new X-ray tube.

The two X-ray photon-generating effects are generally called the &#x27;Characteristic effect&#x27; and the bremsstrahlung effect, a compound of the German &quot;bremsen&quot; meaning to brake, and &quot;Strahlung&quot; meaning radiation.

The range of photonic energies emitted by the system can be adjusted by changing the applied voltage, and installing aluminum filters of varying thicknesses. Aluminum filters are installed in the path of the X-ray beam to remove &quot;soft&quot; (non-penetrating) radiation. The number of emitted X-ray photons, or dose, are adjusted by controlling the current flow and exposure time.

===Heat released===
Heat is produced in the focal spot of the anode. Since a small fraction (less than or equal to 1%) of electron energy is converted to X-rays, it can be ignored in heat calculations.
The quantity of heat produced (in Joule) in the focal spot is given by :

:formula_1
:formula_2 being the waveform factor
:formula_3= peak AC voltage (in kilo Volts)
:formula_4 = tube current (in milli Amperes)
:formula_5 = exposure time (in seconds)

Heat Unit (HU) was used in the past as an alternative to Joule. It is a convenient unit when a single-phase power source is connected to the X-ray tube. With a full-wave rectification of a sine wave, formula_2=formula_7, thus the heat unit:

:1 HU = 0.707 J
:1.4 HU = 1 J

==Types==
===Crookes tube (cold cathode tube)===
Crookes tubes generated the electrons needed to create X-rays by ionization of the residual air in the tube, instead of a heated filament, so they were partially but not completely evacuated. They consisted of a glass bulb with around 10−6 to 5×10−8 atmospheric pressure of air (0.1 to 0.005 Pa). They had an aluminum cathode plate at one end of the tube, and a platinum anode target at the other end. The anode surface was angled so that the X-rays would radiate through the side of the tube. The cathode was concave so that the electrons were focused on a small (~1 mm) spot on the anode, approximating a point source of X-rays, which resulted in sharper images. The tube had a third electrode, an anticathode connected to the anode. It improved the X-ray output, but the method by which it achieved this is not understood. A more common arrangement used a copper plate anticathode (similar in construction to the cathode) in line with the anode such that the anode was between the cathode and the anticathode.

To operate, a DC voltage of a few kilovolts to as much as 100 kV was applied between the anodes and the cathode, usually generated by an induction coil, or for larger tubes, an electrostatic machine.

Crookes tubes were unreliable. As time passed, the residual air would be absorbed by the walls of the tube, reducing the pressure. This increased the voltage across the tube, generating &#x27;harder&#x27; X-rays, until eventually the tube stopped working. To prevent this, &#x27;softener&#x27; devices were used (see picture). A small tube attached to the side of the main tube contained a mica sleeve or chemical that released a small amount of gas when heated, restoring the correct pressure.

The glass envelope of the tube would blacken with usage due to the X-rays affecting its structure.

===Coolidge tube (hot cathode tube)===
In the Coolidge tube, the electrons are produced by thermionic effect from a tungsten filament heated by an electric current. The filament is the cathode of the tube. The high voltage potential is between the cathode and the anode, the electrons are thus accelerated, then hit the anode.

There are two designs: end-window tubes and side-window tubes. End window tubes usually have &quot;transmission target&quot; which is thin enough to allow X-rays to pass through the target (X-rays are emitted in the same direction as the electrons are moving.) In one common type of end-window tube, the filament is around the anode (&quot;annular&quot; or ring-shaped), the electrons have a curved path (half of a toroid).

What is special about side-window tubes is an electrostatic lens is used to focus the beam onto a very small spot on the anode. The anode is specially designed to dissipate the heat and wear resulting from this intense focused barrage of electrons. The anode is precisely angled at 1-20 degrees off perpendicular to the electron current to allow the escape of some of the X-ray photons which are emitted perpendicular to the direction of the electron current. The anode is usually made of tungsten or molybdenum. The tube has a window designed for escape of the generated X-ray photons.

The power of a Coolidge tube usually ranges from 0.1 to 18 kW.

===Rotating anode tube===

A considerable amount of heat is generated in the focal spot (the area where the beam of electrons coming from the cathode strike to) of a stationary anode. Rather, a rotating anode lets the electron beam sweep a larger area of the anode, thus redeeming the advantage of a higher intensity of emitted radiation, along with reduced damage to the anode compared to its stationary state.

The focal spot temperature can reach during an exposure, and the anode assembly can reach following a series of large exposures. Typical anodes are a tungsten-rhenium target on a molybdenum core, backed with graphite. The rhenium makes the tungsten more ductile and resistant to wear from the impact of the electron beams. The molybdenum conducts heat from the target. The graphite provides thermal storage for the anode, and minimizes the rotating mass of the anode.

===Microfocus X-ray tube===
Some X-ray examinations (such as, e.g., non-destructive testing and 3-D microtomography) need very high-resolution images and therefore require X-ray tubes that can generate very small focal spot sizes, typically below 50 μm in diameter. These tubes are called microfocus X-ray tubes.

There are two basic types of microfocus X-ray tubes: solid-anode tubes and metal-jet-anode tubes.

Solid-anode microfocus X-ray tubes are in principle very similar to the Coolidge tube, but with the important distinction that care has been taken to be able to focus the electron beam into a very small spot on the anode. Many microfocus X-ray sources operate with focus spots in the range 5-20 μm, but in the extreme cases spots smaller than 1 μm may be produced.

The major drawback of solid-anode microfocus X-ray tubes is their very low operating power. To avoid melting the anode, the electron-beam power density must be below a maximum value. This value is somewhere in the range 0.4-0.8 W/μm depending on the anode material. This means that a solid-anode microfocus source with a 10 μm electron-beam focus can operate at a power in the range 4-8 W.

In metal-jet-anode microfocus X-ray tubes the solid metal anode is replaced with a jet of liquid metal, which acts as the electron-beam target. The advantage of the metal-jet anode is that the maximum electron-beam power density is significantly increased. Values in the range 3-6 W/μm have been reported for different anode materials (gallium and tin). In the case with a 10 μm electron-beam focus a metal-jet-anode microfocus X-ray source may operate at 30-60 W.

The major benefit of the increased power density level for the metal-jet X-ray tube is the possibility to operate with a smaller focal spot, say 5 μm, to increase image resolution and at the same time acquire the image faster, since the power is higher (15-30 W) than for solid-anode tubes with 10 μm focal spots.

==Hazards of X-ray production from vacuum tubes==

Any vacuum tube operating at several thousand volts or more can produce X-rays as an unwanted byproduct, raising safety issues. The higher the voltage, the more penetrating the resulting radiation and the more the hazard. CRT displays, once common in color televisions and computer displays, operate at depending on size, making them the main concern among household appliances. Historically, concern has focused less on the CRT, since its thick glass envelope is impregnated with several pounds of lead for shielding, than on high voltage (HV) rectifier and voltage regulator tubes inside earlier TVs. In the late 1960s it was found that a failure in the HV supply circuit of some General Electric TVs could leave excessive voltages on the regulator tube, causing it to emit X-rays. The same failure mode was also observed in early revisions of Soviet-made &quot;Rubin&quot; TVs equipped with GP-5 voltage-regulator tube. The models were recalled and the ensuing scandal caused the US agency responsible for regulating this hazard, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to require that all TVs include circuits to prevent excessive voltages in the event of failure. The hazard associated with excessive voltages was eliminated with the advent of all-solid-state TVs, which have no tubes other than the CRT. Since 1969, the FDA has limited TV X-ray emission to 0.5 mR (milliroentgen) per hour. As other screen technologies advanced, starting in the 1990s, the production of CRTs was slowly phased out. These other technologies, such as LED, LCD and OLED, are incapable of producing x-rays due to the lack of a high voltage transformer.

<doc id="907909" wikidata="Q151776" url="?curid=907909" title="Matsue Castle">
<text>is a Japanese castle located in Matsue, Shimane Prefecture.

Matsue Castle was constructed from 1607 to 1611 by Horio Yoshiharu, the first &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Matsue Domain, during the early Edo period. Ownership was passed to the Izumo branch of the Kyōgoku in 1633 and then the Matsudaira, a junior branch of the ruling Tokugawa clan, in 1637. The Matsudaira donated Matsue Castle to the city of Matsue in 1927.

Matsue Castle is one of few remaining feudal Japanese castles that retains its main keep in its original wooden form and not a modern concrete reconstruction. Built after the last great war of feudal Japan, the keep has survived earthquakes, fires, wars and other causes that destroyed or damaged many Japanese castles. However, a number of its castle buildings were demolished during the early Meiji period, leaving only the keep, an attached turret and stone walls existing as original structures today, though some of the other castle buildings have been reconstructed in modern times. Matsue Castle, standing on the shores of Lake Shinji, is one of Japan&#x27;s Three Great Lake Castles and the heart of Matsue&#x27;s central riverside district.

==History==
Of the 100+ castles remaining in Japan, Matsue Castle is the only one with a surviving main keep in the San&#x27;in region. This keep is the second largest, the third tallest (30m) and the sixth oldest amongst Japanese castles. It was built over a period of 5 years by the daimyō of the Izumo region, Horio Yoshiharu, and was completed in 1611.

After the reigns of Horio Tadaharu and Kyōgoku Tadataka, Matsudaira Naomasa, a grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu, became Lord of the castle, after being transferred from Matsumoto in Shinano Province, and thus began a reign that lasted 10 generations of the Matsudaira clan over a period of 234 years.

In 1875, all of the buildings within the castle were dismantled, with the exception of the castle tower itself and attached turret, which were allowed to remain due to pressure from interest groups. These buildings underwent a complete reconstruction between 1950 and 1955. In 2001, several of the castle&#x27;s former turrets were reconstructed.

The keep is a complex structure, built in a watchtower-style, that appears to be five stories from the outside, but has, in fact, six levels inside. Most of the walls of the keep are painted black. It is a strong structure, built to withstand warfare, yet at the same time, it is majestic and solemn, reminiscent of the Momoyama style.

The tenshu and attached turret of Matsue Castle have been registered as a national treasure of Japan since July 9, 2015.

<doc id="907910" wikidata="Q1647521" url="?curid=907910" title="Electric Mud">
<text>Electric Mud is the fifth studio album by Muddy Waters, with members of Rotary Connection playing as his backing band. Released in 1968, it presents Muddy Waters as a psychedelic musician. Producer Marshall Chess suggested that Muddy Waters record it in an attempt to appeal to a rock audience.

The album peaked at number 127 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. It was controversial for its fusion of electric blues with psychedelic elements.

==History==
The 1960s saw Marshall Chess seeking to introduce Muddy Waters&#x27; music to a younger audience; Chess Records, Waters&#x27; record label, founded by Marshall&#x27;s father, Leonard Chess, released a series of compilation albums of Muddy Waters&#x27; older music repackaged with psychedelic artwork.

In 1967, Marshall Chess formed Cadet Concept Records as a subsidiary of Chess Records. The label&#x27;s first release was the self-titled debut album of Rotary Connection, a psychedelic band.

The next project Chess conceived was &quot;Electric Mud&quot;, a psychedelic rock concept album; Marshall later stated, &quot;I came up with the idea of &quot;Electric Mud&quot; to help Muddy make money. It wasn&#x27;t to bastardize the blues. It was like a painting, and Muddy was going to be in the painting. It wasn&#x27;t to change his sound, it was a way to get it to that market.&quot;

Chess hoped the new albums would sell well among fans of psychedelic rock bands influenced by Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. According to Muddy Waters, &quot;Quite naturally, I like a good-selling record. I was looking at it because I played for so many of these so-called hippies that I thought probably I could reach them.&quot;

==Production==
To provide the psychedelic sound Chess sought for the album, he assembled &quot;the hottest, most avant garde jazz rock guys in Chicago&quot;: Gene Barge, Pete Cosey, Roland Faulkner, Morris Jennings, Louis Satterfield, Charles Stepney and Phil Upchurch. According to one account of the album&#x27;s recording, Cosey, Upchurch and Jennings joked about calling the group &quot;The Electric Niggers&quot;. According to Marshall Chess, &quot;We were going to call them the Electric Niggers, but my dad wouldn&#x27;t let me.&quot;

The album incorporates use of wah-wah pedal and fuzzbox. Marshall Chess augmented the rhythm of Muddy Waters&#x27; live band with the use of electronic organ and saxophone. According to Marshall Chess, &quot;It was never an attempt to make Muddy Waters a psychedelic artist; it was a concept album like David Bowie being Ziggy Stardust.&quot; Muddy Waters said of the album&#x27;s sound, &quot;That guitar sounds just like a cat – &quot;meow&quot; – and the drums have a loping, busy beat.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m Your Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; incorporates free jazz influences, with Gene Barge performing a concert harp. Muddy Waters performs the vocals of &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot;, a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1967 single, in gospel-soul style with heavy influence from Cream&#x27;s “Sunshine of Your Love.”

The track &quot;She&#x27;s All Right&quot; interpolates The Temptations&#x27; &quot;My Girl&quot;.

According to Buddy Guy, &quot;[Muddy Waters couldn&#x27;t] feel this psychedelic stuff at all... and if the feeling is gone, that&#x27;s it. You can&#x27;t get too busy behind a singer. You&#x27;ve got to let him sing it.&quot; Muddy Waters&#x27; previous albums replicated the sound of his live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated &quot;What the hell do you have a record for if you can&#x27;t play the first time it&#x27;s out? I&#x27;m so sick of that... If you&#x27;ve got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can&#x27;t play no blues.&quot;

The title of the album did not refer to the use of electric guitar, as Muddy Waters had played the instrument since he first signed with Chess Records. The use of the term &quot;electric&quot; is used in a psychedelic context.

==Release==
&quot;Electric Mud&quot; was released in 1968 with a simple black and white cover that did not make it obvious that the music on the album was psychedelic. The album&#x27;s inner spread featured photographs of Muddy Waters having his hair processed at a beauty parlor.

On November 19, 1996, the album was reissued on compact disc by Chess Records. On November 22, 2011, &quot;Electric Mud&quot; and &quot;After the Rain&quot; were combined on a single compact disc by BGO Records. A new vinyl edition was released by Third Man Records in November 2017.

==Reception==

&quot;Electric Mud&quot; sold 150,000 copies within the first six weeks of release. Peaking at number 127 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Billboard 200 album chart, it was Muddy Waters&#x27; first album to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot; charts. However, among critics and blues purists, &quot;Electric Mud&quot; is Waters&#x27; &quot;most polarizing record&quot;, according to Waters biographer Robert Gordon.

Blues purists criticized the album&#x27;s psychedelic sound. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; feature, Pete Welding wrote, &quot;&#x27;Electric Mud&#x27; does great disservice to one of the blues&#x27; most important innovators, and prostitutes the contemporary styles to which his pioneering efforts have led.&quot; Although American critics panned the album, it was better received in England. According to Marshall Chess, &quot;It was the biggest Muddy Waters record we ever had at Chess, and it dropped instantly. The English accepted it; they are more eccentric.&quot;

==Impact, influence and legacy==
Muddy Waters recorded &quot;After the Rain&quot; the following year, incorporating elements of the sound of &quot;Electric Mud&quot;. According to Cosey, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said &#x27;Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.&#x27;&quot;

While blues purists criticized the album, Pete Cosey learned from Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s valet that Hendrix would listen to &quot;Herbert Harper&#x27;s Free Press News&quot; from the album for inspiration before performing live.

Waters later claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, and that he did not consider the album to be blues. He stated, &quot;Every time I go into Chess, [they] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man.&quot; In the biography &quot;The Mojo Man&quot;, Muddy Waters stated &quot;That &quot;Electric Mud&quot; record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, &#x27;This can&#x27;t be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.&#x27;&quot; AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being &quot;crass&quot;.

However, the album has attracted new admirers among the hip hop scene; in &quot;Lost in the Grooves: Scram&#x27;s Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed&quot;, Gene Sculatti wrote that &quot;The rhythm seems to anticipate hip-hop by three decades.&quot; Rapper Chuck D said of the album, &quot;to me it&#x27;s a brilliant record. I&#x27;ve played it about a thousand times. The voice and character of Muddy Waters stand above the new music. Muddy&#x27;s vocals &quot;project&quot;. That&#x27;s what created a hook for me to get into it: these vocals are actually pulling the music.&quot; Chuck D stated that he had been introduced to &quot;Electric Mud&quot; by a member of Public Enemy, which sparked an interest in Muddy Waters&#x27; earlier work, and in roots-oriented blues. Chuck D explained, &quot;It took me a while to warm up to traditional blues. A whole new world. But the automatic thing that struck me right away was the &quot;Electric Mud&quot; thing.&quot; The documentary series &quot;The Blues&quot;, produced by Martin Scorsese, depicts the recording band for &quot;Electric Mud&quot; performing with Chuck D and members of The Roots.

<text>Robert Love Taylor (July 31, 1850March 31, 1912) was an American politician, writer, and lecturer. A member of the Democratic Party, he served three terms as the 24th governor of Tennessee, from 1887 to 1891, and again from 1897 to 1899, and subsequently served as a United States senator from 1907 until his death. He also represented Tennessee&#x27;s 1st district in the United States House of Representatives from 1879 to 1881, the last Democrat to hold the district&#x27;s seat.

A charismatic speaker, Taylor is remembered for defeating his older brother, Alfred A. &quot;Alf&quot; Taylor, in the 1886 gubernatorial campaign known as &quot;The War of the Roses.&quot; The campaign involved storytelling, fiddle-playing, and practical jokes, standing in contrast to the state&#x27;s previous gubernatorial campaigns, which typically involved fierce rhetoric and personal attacks. Though Robert Taylor won in 1886, Alfred Taylor was elected as governor in the early 1920s.

Along with politics, Taylor was a public lecturer and magazine editor. He published several collections of his lectures and short stories in the 1890s and early 1900s, and was co-editor of the &quot;Taylor-Trotwood Magazine&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Taylor was born in Happy Valley, Carter County, Tennessee, the third son of Nathaniel Green Taylor, a Methodist minister, and Emmaline Haynes, an accomplished pianist. His father, a member of the Whig Party, had been defeated by Andrew Johnson in a campaign for Congress in 1849 but would win the seat in the mid-1850s. His mother&#x27;s family supported the Democratic Party, and her brother, Landon Carter Haynes, was a prominent Democratic politician. Robert Taylor would adopt his mother&#x27;s political leanings and become a Democrat, and his older brother, Alfred, would follow his father into the Whig (and later Republican) Party.

Nathaniel Taylor supported the Union during the Civil War, and the family moved to Philadelphia in 1861 when Tennessee seceded and the Confederate Army occupied East Tennessee. In 1864, the Taylor brothers enrolled in Pennington Seminary in New Jersey. The family moved to Washington in 1867 when Nathaniel Taylor was appointed as Commissioner of Indian Affairs by President Andrew Johnson. Robert Taylor took a position in the Treasury Department. The family returned to Tennessee in 1869, where Robert would attend Buffalo Institute (modern Milligan College) and East Tennessee Wesleyan College. While at the former, he cowrote a play with his brother, Alfred.

In the 1870s, Taylor tried several business ventures, including farming, operating a lumber mill, and managing his father&#x27;s Doe River iron forge. He largely failed at all of those, however, since he was reckless with money, overpaid his employees, and preferred conversation and storytelling to working. He read law during this period with S.J. Kirkpatrick in Jonesborough.

In 1878, Alfred Taylor ran for the Republican nomination for Tennessee&#x27;s 1st congressional district seat against Augustus H. Pettibone. At the party&#x27;s convention, Alfred appeared to have more delegates, but Pettibone managed to win the nomination, which led Alfred&#x27;s supporters to suspect corruption. Robert Taylor was convinced to run against Pettibone on the Democratic ticket in the general election. The public got its first real taste of his speaking ability at a debate in Bristol, when Taylor thrashed Pettibone with a &quot;bewildering kaleidoscope of oratory.&quot; With help from Alfred&#x27;s disgruntled supporters, Robert edged Pettibone for the seat by 750 votes. Legislation sponsored by Taylor included a bill calling for a federal income tax.

Taylor was defeated by Pettibone in his re-election campaign in 1880 and lost to Pettibone a third time when he tried to regain the seat in 1882. He launched a pro-Democratic Party newspaper, &quot;The Comet&quot;, in nearby Johnson City. In 1884, Taylor was named the elector from the 1st district for Democratic presidential candidate Grover Cleveland, and campaigned across the district against the Republican elector, Samuel Hawkins. After Cleveland won the election, he appointed Taylor as federal pension agent in Knoxville.

==Governor==
In 1886, Republicans, hoping to exploit divisions in the Democratic Party between the pro-farmer and Bourbon factions, nominated Alfred Taylor for governor. (The office then had a two-year term.) Democrats, realizing they needed a unifier and effective campaigner to counter Alfred, nominated Robert Taylor as their candidate, pitting the two brothers against one another. The Prohibition Party offered its nomination to the Taylors&#x27; father, Nathaniel, but he declined.

The 1886 gubernatorial campaign is remembered for the Taylor brothers&#x27; relatively light-hearted political banter and entertaining speeches. Canvassing together, they spent the first part of each campaign stop &quot;cussing out each other&#x27;s politics&quot; and telling stories and the second part playing fiddle tunes while the crowd danced. At a stop in Madisonville, Robert suggested that both he and Alfred were roses, but he was a white rose while Alfred was a red rose. As their respective supporters subsequently wore white and red roses, the campaign became known as the &quot;War of the Roses&quot; (the name also referred to the 15th-century English conflict). Their campaign stops drew massive crowds, ranging from around 6,000 in smaller towns to 25,000 in Nashville. In a record turnout on election day, Robert Taylor defeated Alfred by 16,000 votes.

Although Taylor was uncomfortable with the criticism and attacks that came with the executive office, he succeeded in enacting both tax and educational reform. He was assailed for issuing too many pardons and demanded for the state to build a reformatory for juveniles. When he did not gain legislative approval for such a reformatory, he issued a pardon to virtually every juvenile who sought one. In 1888, an angry Bourbon faction sought to thwart his nomination for re-election but was unsuccessful. He won the general election later that year, with 156,799 votes to 139,014 for the Republican candidate, Samuel Hawkins, and 6,893 for the Prohibition candidate, J.C. Johnson.

In 1889, Taylor signed into law a poll tax and a number of other bills aimed at suppressing turnout among blacks and the poor. A number of prohibition laws were also repealed. Suffering from ill health and disenchanted by divisions within his own party, he did not seek re-election in 1890.

In the early 1890s, Taylor, struggling with debt from constant campaigning, asked his brother, Alfred (who was now a US representative), for advice. Alfred suggested for Robert to go on a lecture tour and invited Robert&#x27;s family to move in with his family until he got his finances in order. Robert opened his tour on December 29, 1891, at Jobe&#x27;s Hall in Johnson City, where he presented his lecture, &quot;The Fiddle and the Bow,&quot; with an admission price of 50 cents per person. After Alfred left Congress, he joined Robert on tour, and the two co-wrote and presented &quot;Yankee Doodle and Dixie&quot;. The tour was a major financial success by netting the brothers tens of thousands of dollars.

In 1896, the Democratic Party was again concerned about Republicans&#x27; chances of winning the governor&#x27;s office and believed that the incumbent, Peter Turney, had won the office by using questionable tactics two years earlier. When several Democratic leaders invited Taylor to run, he reluctantly agreed and defeated Turney for the party&#x27;s nomination in August 1896. After a fierce general election campaign, he edged the Republican candidate, George Tillman, with about 49% of the vote to Tillman&#x27;s 47%. Republicans suggested voting irregularities had helped Taylor win, but the Democratic-dominated state legislature obstructed any attempt at an investigation.

The most notable event of Taylor&#x27;s second term as governor was the Tennessee Centennial, which marked the 100th anniversary of the state&#x27;s admission to the Union. The state celebrated by producing the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition, a five-month world&#x27;s fair held in Nashville&#x27;s Centennial Park in 1897, with Taylor making numerous appearances.

==Later life==
After his final term as governor, Taylor returned to the lecture circuit, though he continuously sought one of the state&#x27;s US Senate seats, then elected by the legislature. In 1907, he defeated the incumbent Senator Edward W. Carmack in a public primary, and Taylor was elected by the state legislature to the seat later that year. He served from 1907 until his death in 1912. Some of the legislation that he supported was the Sixteenth Amendment, which authorized the federal government to levy income taxes. He helped secure the amendment&#x27;s passage in the Senate in 1909.

In 1910, when incumbent Democratic Governor Malcolm R. Patterson withdrew from the state&#x27;s gubernatorial contest because of the turmoil in the party over Prohibition, Taylor agreed to serve as a replacement nominee. He lost in the general election to the Republican nominee, Ben W. Hooper, who had defeated Taylor&#x27;s brother, Alfred, for the Republican nomination earlier that year.

On March 31, 1912, Taylor suffered a gallstone attack and died following unsuccessful surgery at Providence Hospital in Washington. A specially chartered train carried his body to Nashville, where it lay in the capitol for several days. It was then taken to Knoxville, where a funeral procession of more than 40,000 people, the largest in the city&#x27;s history, attended his burial at Old Gray Cemetery.

The remains of both Robert Love Taylor and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth Halbert Taylor, were removed from the Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville on October 5, 1938 and later interred at the Monte Vista Memorial Park in Johnson City, Tennessee.

==Family==
Taylor&#x27;s great-grandfather, General Nathaniel Taylor (1771–1816), served during the War of 1812. Another great-grandfather, Landon Carter (1760–1800), was a Revolutionary War veteran for whom Carter County was named. Taylor&#x27;s father, Nathaniel Green Taylor (1819–1887), served two terms in Congress (1853–1855 and 1866–1867), and published poetry and religious essays. Taylor&#x27;s brother, Alfred, served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1889–1895), and one term as Governor of Tennessee (1921–1923). Nathaniel Edwin Harris, who served as Governor of Georgia from 1915 to 1917, was a first cousin of Taylor.

Taylor married Sarah Baird in 1878, and they had five children. After she died in 1900, he married Alice Hill during September 1901. This second marriage ended in divorce after a few years. &quot;The Comet&quot; newspaper in Johnson City had reported on May 5, 1904 that Governor Taylor had been divorced from his wife who filed charges of &quot;abandonment and desertion, and failure to provide&quot; against Taylor.

Taylor was married for a third time to Mamie St. John in 1904. Taylor and Sarah&#x27;s daughter Katherine Baird Taylor married Matthew Hillsman &quot;Red&quot; Taylor; their son Peter Taylor became an award-winning writer.

<text>Constantin Dmitrievich Perskyi (Константин Дмитриевич Перский) (2 June 18545 April 1906) was a Russian scientist who is credited with coining the word television (&quot;télévision&quot;) in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the International World Fair in Paris. At the time, he was Professor of Electricity at the Artillery Academy of Saint Petersburg. His paper referred to the work of other experimenters in the field, including Paul Gottlieb Nipkow and Porfiry Ivanovich Bakhmetiev, who were attempting to use the photoelectric properties of selenium as the basis for their research in the field of image transmission.

==Biography==
Konstantin Perskyi was born on 2 June (21 May according to the Julian calendar), 1854 in Tver Governorate. He belonged to a noble family founded by a person who had moved out of Persia in the service of the grand prince of Dmitry Donskoy.

He studied in Michalovsky Artillery College, and after graduation was a member of the squadron headed by the heir to the throne, the future tsar of Russia Alexander III. He took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1877—1878). In 1882 graduated from Michaylovsky Military Artillery Academy.
In 1883—1886 studied in Nikolay General Staff Academy, but was dismissed for private reasons.
His further service was in St. Petersburg as a head of an ammunition (cartridge) workshop, and then of the whole factory currently named after M.I Kalinin.
Was a professor of electric technique in Artillery Academy.

Konstantin Perskyi played an important role in social life of St. Petersburg, was a member of Russian Technical Society, and an academic secretary of the Electrotechnic Society, took part in All-Russia Electrotechnic Meetings.

Practical studies of Persky were mostly related to creation and development of gunnery (artillery) equipment.

In 1899 he presented the report «Современное состояние вопроса об электровидении на расстоянии (телевизирование)» at the First All-Russia Electrotechnic Congress in Saint Petersburg. Then, he presented the same report on 24 August 1900 in Paris at IV International Electrotechnic Congress that was held under auspices of Exposition Universelle, where he first used the term of television widely used afterwards. In Russia the term was used only a few years later.

On 5 April 1906, Colonel Perskyi was ranked Major-General and dismissed from service for health reasons and was awarded with pension, but died soon after.

<text>James Paul Montgomery (born January 24, 1955) is an American former competition swimmer, four-time Olympic medalist, and former world record-holder. Montgomery was the first man to break the 50-second barrier (49.99) in the 100-meter freestyle, at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, where he won three gold medals and one bronze.

== Early swimming ==
Montgomery was born to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas F. Montgomery in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 24, 1955. He began swimming competitively around the age of nine at the Madison Central YMCA pool. He swam for Madison East High School, and held four Wisconsin state freestyle records by his High School Junior year, including the 50, 100, 200, and 400 freestyle. He was coached by Don Moerke at Madison East, and in club swimming by Pat Berry at the Madison Swim Club, switching to the Badger Dolphins the summer before his Junior year. While swimming with the Badger Dolphins Club during summers, Jim credited his coach Jack Pettinger with greatly improving his speed and conditioning.

Jim helped lead Madison East to the 1971 Big Eight Conference title, and he was voted a most valuable competitor at Madison&#x27;s City Swimming Banquet in March 1971. In September, 1971, he was named the outstanding swimmer in Wisconsin by the Wisconsin Swimming Association and became a part of the five member all-state boys swimming team.

== International competition ==
Prior to the Olympics, Montgomery won five gold medals in freestyle events at the first World Championships in 1973 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and took medals in the 4 x 100 meter freestyle relay and the individual 100 meter freestyle at both the 1975 World Aquatics Championships in Cali, Colombia and the 1978 World Aquatics Championships in Berlin, Germany.

== College and 1976 Olympics ==
From Yugoslavia in early September 1973, Montgomery went on to Indiana University, where he majored in Business, and swam for Hall of Fame Coach Doc Counsilman for four years. At Indiana, he won the NCAA 200-yard freestyle and four AAU titles. In 1975 while at Indiana, he set two world records for the 100-meter freestyle and between 1973-1976 was a member of five world record breaking relay teams. Considered the top student athlete in the Big Ten Conference, Jim was presented with the Belfour award in his Senior year at Indiana.
In the summer between his junior and senior college years, he competed in the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games winning golds in the 100-meter freestyle, the 4x200 meter freestyle relay, and the 4x100 meter medley relay, with each an Olympic and World record time. He also won a bronze in the 200-meter freestyle. Jim was the world record holder in the 100-meter event prior to the Olympic Games with a time of 50.59. Only 20 days after Jim set the new world record in the 100-meter freestyle of 49.99 during the &#x27;76 Montreal Olympics, University of Alabama swimmer Jonty Skinner broke Jim&#x27;s record at Philadelphia&#x27;s United States Summer National Swimming Championships by 0.55 seconds. At the Montreal Olympics, Jim was coached both by his Indiana Coach Doc Counsilman, who was Olympic Head Coach, and Assistant Olympic Coach Don Gambril who was assigned to work with Montgomery by Counsilman.

During his coaching career he has taken time to compete in organized open-water swims which include the Maui Channel Swim, the La Jolla Roughwater, the Alcatraz, the Chesapeake Bay swim, and France&#x27;s Race across St. Tropez. He has had several age-group wins in the 2.4 mile Waikiki Roughwater swim.

==Coaching==
After professional swimming, and a move to Dallas, Texas, he worked briefly in hotel management and founded the Dallas Masters swim program in 1981. He later renamed it the Lone Star Masters and in 1990, the name officially became Baylor/Lone Star Masters while Jim was working as Aquatic&#x27;s Director at Baylor&#x27;s Tom Landry Center in Dallas. He began teaching swim lessons in 2007, including a class to help adults get past their fear of water.

===Dallas Aquatic Masters===
Renaming the Baylor/Lone Star Masters team, he founded the Dallas Aquatic Masters club around 1999 with partner and fellow coach, former SMU All-American swimmer Bobby Patten. In 2002, Jim was named U.S. Masters Swimming (USMS) Coach of the Year.

While continuing to coach at Dallas Aquatic Masters, he coached varsity swimming at the Greenhill School in Addison, Texas from 1999 to 2015. Dallas Aquatic Masters continued to operate until around 2020. Jim resigned Greenhill around 2015 to launch the Jim Montgomery Swim School on Preston Road in Dallas.

===Honors===
He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1986 as an Honor Swimmer.

Montgomery married in 1992, and has five children.

<text>The Venus of Berekhat Ram (280,000–250,000 BP) is a pebble found at Berekhat Ram on the Golan Heights. The pebble has been modified by early humans and is suggested to represent a female human figure.

==Description==
The object was excavated and first described by Naama Goren-Inbar from the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The artifact is a scoria pebble, 35 mm long, 25 mm wide, and 21 mm thick. It weighs approximately 10 g. It was excavated in 1981 at the Acheulian site of Berekhat Ram, Golan Heights. The object is dated 280,000 to 250,000 BP.

Goren-Inbar reported several artificial grooves on the object: one is a transversal groove in the upper third, others are longitudinal grooves on the sides below the transversal groove. Alexander Marshack performed a microscopic study of the object in 1997. He also reported artificial modifications including the transversal and longitudinal grooves found by Goren-Inbar. Finally, Francesco d&#x27;Errico and April Nowell re-examined the object using a comparative approach. They partly confirmed, partly corrected the findings of Marshack. d&#x27;Errico and Nowell also reported the above grooves (with some corrections) and, additionally, reported areas of possible abrasion on the front, back and bottom of the object.

==Interpretation==
Goren-Inbar and Marshack suggested that the object resembled a female body and was artificially modified by hominids to emphasize its anthropomorphic features. The object was then called a figurine and is currently known as the Venus of Berekhat Ram (the term &quot;Venus&quot; was taken from the conventional name of much younger Venus figurines of Upper Paleolithic). If this hypothesis is correct, the object would be the earliest example of representational art in the archaeological record, together with the Venus of Tan-Tan.

d&#x27;Errico and Nowell confirmed the artificial nature of modifications of the object, but refrained from identifying it with a human body. They noted that grooves, in general, may have a functional purpose. Still, they stated that the longitudinal symmetrical U-shaped grooves (supposedly representing the &quot;arms&quot;) are hard to explain functionally. So, similarly to Goren-Inbar and Marshack, d&#x27;Errico and Nowell argued in favor of the non-utilitarian and symbolic nature of the object.

==Controversy==
The main discussion around the Venus of Berekhat Ram took place after the study of d&#x27;Errico and Nowell. A number of scholars, namely, Ofer Bar-Yosef, Angela E. Close, João Zilhão, Steven Mithen, Thomas G. Wynn, and Alexander Marshack, commented on that study, while d&#x27;Errico and Nowell provided a reply to these comments (both the comments and reply are included in the manuscript). The discussion around the Venus of Berekhat Ram concerned three questions:

# Whether the scratched marks were made by humans or hominids at all.
# If they were, whether they had non-utilitarian/symbolic intent.
# If they did, whether they were intended to represent a female figure.

===Anthropogenic origin===
All commentators of d&#x27;Errico and Nowell&#x27;s study were convinced by their analysis and results and accepted the hypothesis that the object was modified by early humans. Marshack argued in favor of this hypothesis already in his earlier study of the object.

===Symbolic vs. utilitarian===
d&#x27;Errico and Nowell&#x27;s argument that the &quot;arm&quot;-shaped grooves suggest a symbolic nature of the object was questioned by three commentators: João Zilhão from the Instituto Português de Arqueologia, Thomas Wynn from the University of Colorado, and Steven Mithen from the University of Reading. All of them suggested that the object and its grooves could have a utilitarian purpose. Zilhão hypothesized that the object could be used to produce pigment and that the grooves could be byproducts of this process. Wynn suggested that the object could be a result of &quot;someone passing time with a stone tool and a pebble&quot;. Mithen also stated that our symbolic understanding of the object does not imply that it was considered as such by early humans who produced it, because the cognitive processes for symbolic thinking we use today may differ from the ones used by early humans.

d&#x27;Errico and Nowell argued, however, that, although their analysis and results cannot refute a functional interpretation of the object, there are too many inconsistencies in this interpretation to investigate it any further. For example, d&#x27;Errico and Nowell suggested that, based on the existing Acheulean archaeological record, pigment &quot;would have been more quickly and effectively produced by grinding one face of this object against a basalt flake or smashing it with a similar tool&quot;, which is different from the process used to create the observed grooves. This contradicts the hypothesis of Zilhão. d&#x27;Errico and Nowell also believe that the grooves on the object are the result of a deliberate motion rather than of non-purposive behavior, as suggested by Wynn.

===Representational nature===
Zilhão, Wynn, and Mithen rejected the hypothesis on the symbolic nature of the object and, thus, rejected the idea that the object is iconic. Angela E. Close from the University of Washington also could not see a figurine of a woman in the object, but, instead, the object reminded her of a penguin and a phallus when seen from different angles.

<text>IJlst (; ) is a city in Friesland, Netherlands. It is located about 3 km southwest of Sneek. It lies within the municipality of Súdwest-Fryslân and had a population of approximately 3,140 in January 2017.

==History==
It received city rights in 1268 and is one of the eleven cities in Friesland. It was the fourth city receiving city rights after Stavoren, Hindeloopen and Harlingen. The city was well-known for its excellent location in local trade and its ship-building industry. When the Middelzee silted up, the importance of trade declined and the city focused on its ship-building industry. The city had its own castle, a so called stins, named the Ylostins.

Between 1654 and 1664, Renier van Tzum was burgomaster of IJlst. Van Tzum was the &quot;opperhoofd&quot; or chief factor of the Dutch East India Company (&quot;Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie&quot; or VOC) in Siam (1643–1644). He was also VOC &quot;opperhoofd&quot; in Japan (1644–1646).

Before 2011, the city was part of the Wymbritseradiel municipality and before 1984 IJlst was an independent municipality.

==Name==
The name IJlst derives from the name of the river IJ or Ey. The river IJ is the central point of the little city.
IJlst has a railway station located between the cities of Sneek and Stavoren.

<doc id="907929" wikidata="Q392162" url="?curid=907929" title="John P. Buchanan">
<text>John Price Buchanan (October 24, 1847May 14, 1930) was an American politician and farmers&#x27; advocate. He served as the 25th governor of Tennessee from 1891 to 1893, and was president of the Tennessee Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Laborers&#x27; Union in the late 1880s. Buchanan&#x27;s lone term as governor was largely marred by the Coal Creek War, an armed uprising by coal miners aimed at ending the state&#x27;s convict lease system.

==Early life==

Buchanan was born on October 24, 1847 in Williamson County, Tennessee, the son of Thomas and Rebecca (Shannon) Buchanan. He attended common schools, and joined the Confederate Army as a private in the Fourth Alabama Cavalry in 1864. After the war, he moved to Rutherford County, Tennessee, where he engaged in farming and livestock breeding. By the 1880s, his farm was one of the most successful in the county. He was elected to the county&#x27;s seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1886, and again in 1888. Among the legislation he sponsored was a bill exempting farmers&#x27; co-ops from the state&#x27;s merchant tax.
In the decades after the Civil War, Tennessee&#x27;s farmers struggled with both falling crop prices and rising transportation costs, and called for regulation of railroad rates. Governor William B. Bate had established a railroad commission during his first term, but the party&#x27;s Bourbon and industrial wings repealed the act authorizing this commission in 1885, leaving farmers outraged. The state&#x27;s farmers formed a chapter of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance, the Tennessee Farmers&#x27; Alliance, which elected Buchanan its first president in 1888. The following year, Buchanan helped implement the Farmers&#x27; Alliance&#x27;s merger with a rival group, the Agricultural Wheel, to form the Tennessee Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Laborers&#x27; Union (TFLU).

==Governor==

By the late 1880s, the TFLU and its supporters comprised a significant faction of the state Democratic Party, known as the &quot;Hayseed&quot; or &quot;Wool-hat&quot; Democrats. In the gubernatorial race of 1890, incumbent Robert Love Taylor was not seeking reelection, and at the party&#x27;s July convention, various factions put forth their own candidates for the party&#x27;s nomination. The Bourbon faction supported Congressman Josiah Patterson, the New South faction supported railroad magnate Jere Baxter, and the Hayseeds supported Buchanan. After six days and multiple ballots, Buchanan was declared the nominee. Many Democrats blasted Buchanan as too unsophisticated to run as the party&#x27;s nominee, and he was ridiculed by newspapers across the state.

Along with the farmers&#x27; vote, Buchanan courted the labor vote by promising to appoint a commissioner of labor. He argued that banks and financiers had too much political influence, and proposed regulating railroad rates. Seeking to further cement his position among white farmers, he campaigned against the federal Lodge Bill, which would have provided protections for voting rights for blacks in the South. On election day, he won easily, capturing 113,549 votes to 76,081 votes for the Republican candidate, Lewis Baxter, and 11,082 votes for the Prohibition candidate, David Cato Kelley.

After his inauguration in early 1891, Buchanan, working with a coalition of Hayseed Democrats and Republicans in the state legislature, enacted several measures aimed at helping farmers and labor, including laws regulating fertilizer products and recognizing Labor Day, restrictions on foreign companies doing business in Tennessee, and a law establishing a state commissioner of labor. For the latter office, he appointed Knights of Labor activist George Ford. He also signed a law standardizing the state&#x27;s public school curriculum, and enacted a measure providing pensions for Confederate veterans. Buchanan strengthened the state&#x27;s poll tax, and enacted several voting restrictions aimed at suppressing the African-American vote.

===Coal Creek War===

In July 1891, an open insurrection, known as the Coal Creek War, erupted in East Tennessee when the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC) attempted to replace striking miners at its Briceville mine with convicts leased from the state. The striking miners had rounded up the convicts and had sent them to Knoxville via train, and the TCMC demanded Buchanan call up the state guard and put down the insurrection. This presented a difficult dilemma for Buchanan, who had campaigned on labor rights, but as governor was obligated to enforce the law. Furthermore, while the Farmers&#x27; Alliance sought to end convict leasing, Buchanan supported it, arguing it saved the state hundreds of thousands of dollars.

On July 16, Buchanan, at the head of three state guard companies, personally escorted the convicts from Knoxville back to the stockades in the Coal Creek Valley. He met with the leaders of the striking miners near Briceville, and assured them that while he was a friend of labor, he had no choice but to uphold the law. One of the strike leaders, a blacklisted miner named Eugene Merrell, rejected Buchanan&#x27;s statements. He argued that if Buchanan were intent on enforcing the law, he would also uphold laws requiring independent checkweighmen (who weighed the coal for which the miners were paid) and payment in legal tender (as opposed to scrip), which the TCMC had consistently ignored. The governor returned to Nashville the following day, leaving the valley&#x27;s stockades under the protection of 107 guardsmen.
On July 20, just a few days after Buchanan left the valley, the striking miners overwhelmed the guardsmen protecting the stockades at Briceville and nearby Coal Creek, and once again sent the convicts back to Knoxville. After meeting with labor and business leaders in Knoxville, Buchanan negotiated a 60-day truce with the miners, agreeing to call a special session of the state legislature to consider ending the convict leasing system. He also called up an additional twelve guard companies to protect the Coal Creek stockades.

The state legislature met in a special session in September 1891 to consider the convict lease system and the events surrounding the Coal Creek War. Buchanan suggested they modify existing contracts to protect free miners, and called for the establishment of a state penitentiary. While the legislature upheld miners&#x27; rights to independent checkweighmen and payment in legal tender, it refused to end the convict lease system, and passed bills making it a felony to interfere with state convicts.

When the legislature failed to end convict leasing, Buchanan&#x27;s labor commissioner, George Ford, tried to help the miners by suing the state on behalf of the convicts, arguing that the state&#x27;s primary lessee, the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company (TCI), had no authority to sublease the convicts to TCMC. In October 1891, the Tennessee Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Peter Turney, ruled against Ford. With nowhere else to turn, the striking miners launched a series of attacks against mining company stockades in late 1891 and early 1892, in some cases freeing the convicts and burning the stockades. By April 1892, the revolt had spread to mines in Grundy County to the south. In August, Buchanan dispatched General Samuel T. Carnes to Coal Creek with over 500 militiamen, and order was finally restored.

Buchanan was vilified by both miners and mining company owners as ineffective and incompetent, and was frequently assailed in the press. In the gubernatorial race of 1892, the Democratic Party&#x27;s Bourbon and New South factions thwarted his bid for reelection, instead choosing Chief Justice Turney as the party&#x27;s nominee. Buchanan entered the race as an independent, still claiming to represent farmers&#x27; interests, and winning the backing of the rising Populist movement. On election day, however, he placed third, winning just 31,515 votes to 127,247 for Turney, 100,629 for Republican George Winstead, and 5,427 for Prohibitionist Edward H. East.

==Death==

After his defeat in the 1892 election, Buchanan returned to his farm in Rutherford County, and never again sought public office. He died in Murfreesboro on May 14, 1930, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery.

==Family==

Buchanan&#x27;s ancestors were Scots-Irish. His family was among the earliest to settle in the Nashville area, and constructed Buchanan&#x27;s Station south of the city in the 1780s. Buchanan&#x27;s younger brother, James S. Buchanan, served as president of the University of Oklahoma in the 1920s.

Buchanan married Frances McGill in 1867. They had nine children. Buchanan&#x27;s grandson, James M. Buchanan (1919–2013), was a noted economist who won the Nobel Prize in 1986.

<text>The Alaska Railroad is a Class II railroad that operates freight and passenger trains in the state of Alaska. The railroad&#x27;s mainline runs between Seward on the southern coast and Fairbanks, near the center of the state. It passes through Anchorage and Denali National Park, to which 17% of visitors travel by train.

The railroad has of track, including sidings, rail yards and branch lines. The main line between Seward and Fairbanks is over long. The branch to Whittier conveys freight railcars interchanged with the contiguous United States via rail barges sailing between the Port of Whittier and Harbor Island in Seattle.

Construction of the railroad started in 1903 when the Alaska Central Railroad built a line starting in Seward and extending north. The Alaska Central went bankrupt in 1907 and was reorganized as the Alaska Northern Railroad Company in 1911, which extended the line another northward. On March 12, 1914, the U.S. Congress agreed to fund construction and operation of an all-weather railroad from Seward to Fairbanks and purchased the rail line from the financially struggling Alaska Northern.

As the government started building the estimated $35 million railroad, it opened a construction town along Ship Creek, eventually giving rise to Anchorage, now the state&#x27;s largest city. In 1917, the government purchased the narrow gauge Tanana Valley Railroad, mostly for its railyard in Fairbanks. The railroad was completed on July 15, 1923 with President Warren G. Harding traveling to Alaska to drive a ceremonial golden spike at Nenana. Ownership of the railroad passed from the federal government to the state of Alaska on January 6, 1985.

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of . In 2019, the company generated a profit on revenues of , holding in total assets.

==History==

In 1903 a company called the Alaska Central Railroad began to build a rail line beginning at Seward, near the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, northward. The company built of track by 1909 and went into receivership. This route carried passengers, freight and mail to the upper Turnagain Arm. From there, goods were taken by boat at high tide, and by dog team or pack train to Eklutna and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley.

In 1909, another company, the Alaska Northern Railroad Company, bought the rail line and extended it another northward. From the new end, goods were floated down the Turnagain Arm in small boats. The Alaska Northern Railroad went into receivership in 1914.

At about this time, the United States government was planning a railroad route from Seward to the interior town of Fairbanks. President William Howard Taft authorized a commission to survey a route in 1912. The line would be long and provide an all-weather route to the interior.

In 1914, the government bought the Alaska Northern Railroad and moved its headquarters to Ship Creek, in what would later become Anchorage. The government began to extend the rail line northward.

In 1917, the Tanana Valley Railroad in Fairbanks was heading into bankruptcy. It owned a small (narrow gauge) line that serviced the towns of Fairbanks and the mining communities in the area as well as the boat docks on the Tanana River near Fairbanks.

The government bought the Tanana Valley Railroad, principally for its terminal facilities. The section between Fairbanks and Happy was converted to dual gauge to complete the line from Seward to Fairbanks. The government extended the southern portion of the track to Nenana, and later converted the extension to standard gauge. The Alaska Railroad continued to operate the remaining TVRR narrow gauge line as the Chatanika Branch (the terminus was near the Yukon River), until decommissioning it in 1930.
In 1923 they built the Mears Memorial Bridge across the Tanana River at Nenana. This was the final link in the Alaska Railroad and at the time, was the second longest single-span steel railroad bridge in the country. U.S. President Warren G. Harding drove the golden spike that completed the railroad on July 15, 1923, on the north side of the bridge. The railroad was part of the US Department of the Interior.
The Alaska Railroad&#x27;s first diesel locomotive entered service in 1944. The railroad retired its last steam locomotive in 1966.

In 1958, land for the future Clear Air Force Station was purchased. (Clear is about south of Nenana.) Approximately of track were diverted, and later a spur was constructed to deliver coal to its power station.

The railroad was greatly affected by the Good Friday earthquake, which struck southern Alaska in 1964. The yard and trackage around Seward buckled and the trackage along Turnagain Arm was damaged by floodwaters and landslides. It took several months to restore full service along the line.

In 1967, the railroad was transferred to the Federal Railroad Administration, an agency within the newly created United States Department of Transportation.

In 1975-76, an infusion of $15 million from the DOT enabled various capital improvements including those to facilitate hauling materials for the Alaska Pipeline.

On January 6, 1985, the state of Alaska bought the railroad from the U.S. government for $22.3 million, based on a valuation determined by the US Railway Association. The state immediately invested over $70 million on improvements and repairs that compensated for years of deferred maintenance. The purchase agreement prohibits the Alaska Railroad from paying dividends or otherwise returning capital to the state of Alaska, unlike the state&#x27;s other quasi-corporations: the Alaska Permanent Fund, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, and the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority.

==Proposed expansion in Alaska==
=== Northern Rail Extension to Delta Junction ===
An extension of the railroad from Fairbanks to Delta Junction over a bridge spanning the Tanana River was envisioned as early as 2009. The 2011 Alaska state budget would provide $40 million in funding for the bridge, which initially be only for vehicular use. The United States Department of Defense would provide another $100 million in funds, as the bridge and a subsequent rail line would provide year-round access to Fort Greely and the Joint Tanana Training Complex. Groundbreaking ceremony for the Tanana River Bridge took place on September 28, 2011, and the new bridge was opened (for military road traffic only) in 2014.

=== Point MacKenzie Line ===
On 21 November 2011, the Surface Transportation Board approved the construction of a new 25-mile (40 km) line between Port MacKenzie and the existing main line at Houston, Alaska. As of May 2023 this spur line had not been completed.

=== Anchorage Vicinity Service ===

A spur line was built to Ted Stevens International Airport in 2003, along with a depot, officially named after Bill Sheffield. The line never received scheduled service but cruise lines charter trains to convey passengers between ships and the airport. The railroad currently leases the depot to citizens for private events such as conferences, seminars, and corporate functions.

There are plans to provide commuter rail service within the Anchorage metropolitan area (Anchorage to Mat-Su Valley via Eagle River, north Anchorage to south Anchorage); additional tracks would be necessary to accommodate the heavy freight traffic.

===Proposed connection to the contiguous 48 states===
In 2001 federal legislation, sponsored by Republican U.S. senator (and later Alaska governor) Frank Murkowski, formed a bilateral commission to study feasibility of building a rail link between Canada and Alaska; Canada was asked to be part of the commission, but the Canadian federal government did not choose to join the commission or commit funds for the study. However, the Yukon territorial government did show some interest.

A June 2006 report by the commission recommended Carmacks, Yukon, as a hub, with three possibilities: A line could go northward to Delta Junction, Alaska (Alaska Railroad&#x27;s northern end-of-track). Another line could go from Carmacks to Hazelton, British Columbia (which is served by the CN), passing through Watson Lake, Yukon, and Dease Lake, British Columbia. The third line could go from Carmacks to either Haines or Skagway, Alaska. The latter path by way of Whitehorse, Yukon, the northern terminus of the (narrow-gauge) White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad). However, currently the latter&#x27;s trains only reach Carcross, Yukon, because service has not been completely restored following a 1982 embargo of the entire line.

Following the demise of the ill-fated Keystone XL Pipeline project, the Alaska Canada Rail Link (ACRL) was rekindled as an alternative. In November 2015, the National Post reported that a link between the southern provinces and the Alaska Railroad was again being considered by the Canadian federal government, this time routing to Alberta. In this scenario, the route would originate at Delta Junction and use Carmacks as a hub, as in prior plans. The route would continue through Watson Lake, Yukon, en route to a stop at Fort Nelson, British Columbia. It would continue to Peace River, Alberta, with its southern terminus at Fort McMurray. The route was endorsed by the Assembly of First Nations. It was unclear whether this rail connection would ever be utilized for passenger service.

On September 25, 2020, then President Donald Trump announced he would issue a presidential permit to the Alaska-Alberta Railway Development Corporation (A2A Railway), which had an agreement with Alaska Railway to develop a joint operating plan for the rail connection to Canada. The proposed A2A Railway would have connected to the Alaska Railroad at North Pole, Alaska, and run through Yukon Territory to Fort Nelson, and from there to a terminus at Fort McMurray, Alberta. (The A2A Railway had also been negotiating with the Mat-Su Borough on an agreement to complete the Port Mackenzie Railway Extension.)

==Routes and tourism==

The railroad is a major tourist attraction in the summer. Coach cars feature wide windows and domes. Private cars owned by the major cruise companies are towed behind the Alaska Railroad&#x27;s own cars, and trips are included with various cruise packages.

===Routes===
* The &quot;Denali Star&quot; runs from Anchorage to Fairbanks (approximately 12 hours one-way) and back with stops in Talkeetna and Denali National Park, from which various flight and bus tours are available. The Denali Star only operates between May 15 and September 15. Although the trip is only about , it takes 12 hours to travel from Anchorage to Fairbanks as the tracks wind through mountains and valleys; the train&#x27;s top speed is but sometimes hovers closer to .
* The &quot;Aurora Winter Train&quot; is available in winter months (September 15 - May 15) on a reduced weekend-only schedule (Northbound, Saturday mornings; Southbound, Sunday mornings) between Anchorage and Fairbanks on the same route as the Denali Star.
* The &quot;Coastal Classic&quot; winds its way south from Anchorage along Turnagain Arm before turning south to the Kenai Peninsula, eventually reaching Seward. This trip takes around four and a half hours due to some slow trackage as the line winds its way over mountains.
* The &quot;Glacier Discovery&quot; provides a short (2-hour) trip south from Anchorage to Whittier for a brief stop before reversing direction for a stop at Grandview while returning to Anchorage in the evening.
* The &quot;Hurricane Turn&quot; provides rail service to people living between Talkeetna and the Hurricane area. This area has no roads, and the railroad provides the lifeline for residents who depend on the service to obtain food and supplies. One of the last flag-stop railway routes in the United States, passengers can board the &quot;Hurricane Turn&quot; anywhere along the route by waving a large white flag or cloth.
* The &quot;Grandview Cruise Train&quot; is a set of single-level passenger dome cars that Alaska Railroad makes available for charter to cruise line operators for the transportation of their passengers exclusively, typically between May 15 and September 15. On alternate Mondays this train operates under charter to NCL Holdings between Anchorage International Airport and the Whittier NCL Depot, where it meets Norwegian Cruise Line vessels. On Thursdays and Fridays this train operates under charter to Royal Caribbean Group between Anchorage International Airport and the Dale R. Lindsey Alaska Railroad lntermodal Terminal in Seward, where it meets Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises vessels. On Sundays this train operates under charter to HAP Alaska-Yukon between Anchorage Depot and the Whittier HAP Depot, where it meets Holland America Line vessels. On Saturdays and alternate Wednesdays this train operates under charter to HAP Alaska-Yukon between McKinley station, located 3.4 miles south of Talkeetna, and the Whittier HAP Depot, where it meets Princess Cruises vessels; this operation is known as the &quot;McKinley Express&quot;.
* The &quot;Denali Express&quot; uses a set of bilevel passenger dome cars that are owned by Tour Alaska, a subsidiary of Carnival, and a single bilevel passenger dome car that is owned by Alaska Railroad, with all cars operated under contract by Alaska Railroad. This train operates Saturdays, Sundays, and alternate Wednesdays exclusively for Holland America Line and Princess Cruises passengers. The train operates between Denali Park Depot and Whittier HAP Depot, where it meets Holland America Line and Princess Cruises vessels.
* The &quot;McKinley Explorer&quot; uses a set of bilevel passenger dome cars that are owned by Tour Alaska, a subsidiary of Carnival, operated under contract by Alaska Railroad. This train operates daily and is available to all persons, whether a cruise line passenger or not. The train operates between Denali Park Depot and Anchorage Depot.
* The &quot;Wilderness Express&quot; uses a bilevel passenger dome car that is owned by Premier Alaska Tours, and which is attached to the Denali Star train and operated by Alaska Railroad. This service operates daily and is available to all persons, whether a cruise line passenger or not. While the Wilderness Express is part of the same consist as the Denali Star, there is no passage between this car and the Denali Star cars. The train operates between Fairbanks Depot and Anchorage Depot.
* Note that the spur affording access to the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is used during the summer season for cruise ship service only. It was activated temporarily during the Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) 2006 convention to provide airport-to-hotel mass transit for delegates.

==Rolling stock==

By 1936, the company had rostered 27 steam locomotives, 16 railcars, 40 passenger cars and 858 freight cars.

===Active===
, Alaska Railroad rosters a total of 51 locomotives, two control cab units, and one DMU (self-propelled railcar):
* 28 EMD SD70MAC locomotives (12 equipped with head-end power for passenger service)
* 15 EMD GP40-2 locomotives
* 8 EMD GP38-2 locomotives
* 2 EMD F40PH control cab units
* 1 Colorado Railcar DMU

* EMD MP15AC (Retired 2009)
* EMD GP49
* EMD F7
*EMD FP7 (Two units, 1510 and 1512 sold to Verde Canyon Railroad in Arizona for excursions)

===Other===

In 2011 the Alaska Railroad reacquired ARR 557, the last steam locomotive bought new by the railroad and the last steam locomotive used by the railroad, with the intent to refurbish and operate it in special excursions between Anchorage and Portage.

A USATC S160 &quot;2-8-0 Consolidation&quot; engine built in 1944 by Baldwin Locomotive Works, 557 was originally coal-fired but was converted to oil in 1955. It operated until 1964, when it was deemed surplus and sold as scrap. It was purchased by Monte Holm of Moses Lake, Washington and displayed in his House of Poverty Museum.

After Holm&#x27;s death in 2006, Jim and Vic Jansen bought 557 from the museum and returned it to the Alaska Railroad on the condition that it be restored to operation and put into service.

The locomotive was sold to the non-profit Engine 557 Restoration Company for &quot;One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and valuable considerations&quot; and they have invested () 77 months and over 75,000 hours of volunteer time in the restoration and overhaul.

==In popular culture==
* The Alaska Railroad was prominently featured in the 1985 movie &quot;Runaway Train&quot;.
* The Simpson family rides the Alaska Railroad in &quot;The Simpsons Movie.&quot;
* The railroad is mentioned in the 1995 film &quot;Balto&quot;.
* The Railroad is the subject of a 2013 reality TV series named &quot;Railroad Alaska&quot; on Destination America.

<doc id="907932" wikidata="Q250209" url="?curid=907932" title="Mohawk hairstyle">
<text>The mohawk (also referred to as a mohican in British English) is a hairstyle in which, in the most common variety, both sides of the head are shaven, leaving a strip of noticeably longer hair in the center. Mohawk hairstyles have existed for thousands of years. As of the 21st century, they are most commonly associated with punks, or broader non-conformity.

The mohawk is also sometimes referred to as an iro in reference to the Iroquois (who include the Mohawk people), from whom the hairstyle is supposedly derived – though historically the hair was plucked out rather than shaved. Additionally, hairstyles bearing these names more closely resemble those worn by the Pawnee, rather than the Mohawk, Mohicans, Mohegan, or other groups whose names are phonetically similar.

The world record for the tallest full mohawk goes to Joseph Grisamore, also known as the &quot;Mohawk King&quot;, who has a tall mohawk, while the world record for the tallest mohican hairstyle goes to Kazuhiro Watanabe, who has a tall mohawk.

== Etymology ==
While the mohawk hairstyle takes its name from the people of the Mohawk nation, an indigenous people of North America who originally inhabited the Mohawk Valley in Upstate New York, the association comes from Hollywood and more specifically from the popular 1939 film &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; starring Henry Fonda.

The Mohawk and the rest of the Iroquois confederacy (Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Tuscarora, and Oneida) in fact wore a square of hair on the back of the crown of the head. The Mohawk did not shave their heads when creating this square of hair but rather pulled the hair out, small tufts at a time. The following is a first-hand account of James Smith, who was captured during the French and Indian War and adopted into the Mohawk tribe:

Therefore, a true hairstyle of the Mohawks was one of plucked-out hair, leaving a three-inch square of hair on the back crown of the head with three short braids of hair decorated. The three braids of a True Mohawk hairstyle are represented today on traditional headdresses of the Mohawk known as a &quot;Gustoweh&quot;. Mohawk Gustowehs have three upright eagle feathers that represent the three braids of long ago. When not decorated, the very short braids were allowed to hang loose as seen in Good Peter&#x27;s image in the referenced article.

The name &quot;Mohican&quot; is more common in the UK, popularized by the use of the style in the 1971 BBC adaptation of &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, though in that show it was actually worn by characters representing the Huron people.

== Historical use ==

The hairstyle has been in existence in many parts of the world for millennia. For instance, the Clonycavan Man, a 2000-year-old male bog body discovered near Dublin, Ireland, in 2003, was found to be wearing a mohawk styled with plant oil and pine resin. Herodotus stated that the Macai, a northern Libyan tribe, &quot;shave their hair so as to leave tufts, letting the middle of their hair grow long, but round this on all sides shaving it close to the skin.&quot;

Among the Pawnee people, who historically lived in present-day Nebraska and in northern Kansas, a &quot;mohawk&quot; hairstyle was common.

When going to war, 16th-century Ukrainian Cossacks would shave their heads, leaving a long central strip. This haircut was known as an oseledets or chupryna, and was often braided or tied in a topknot.

During World War II, many American GIs, notably paratroopers from the 17th Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division, wore mohawks to intimidate their enemies. It was also occasionally worn by American troops during the Vietnam War. In the early 1950s, mohawks were worn by some jazz musicians such as Sonny Rollins, and In the 1970s, Punk subculture wore mohawks.

== Varieties ==
Although a mohawk is most widely defined as a narrow, central strip of upright hair running from the forehead to the nape, with the sides of the head bald, the term can be applied more loosely to various similar hairstyles, many of which have informal names.

*A reverse mohawk, also known as a nohawk or hawkmo, rather than the strip of longer hair in the center of the scalp, features a shaved strip from the forehead to the nape of the neck leaving hair on either side of the line. Pioneering examples were sported by professional wrestler Road Warrior Hawk, and English rock singer Peter Gabriel whilst on tour with progressive rock band Genesis in 1973.
*A fauxhawk copies the style of a mohawk, but without shaving the sides of the head and not extending past the peak of the cranium. The fauxhawk is typically worn with a small but noticeable spike in the middle, though usually considerably shorter than many traditional mohawks. The style re-emerged in the 2000s, with some of the popularly known wearers being Travis vocalist Fran Healy, David Beckham, Elijah Wood, and Jónsi. The fauxhawk is also known as the &quot;Hoxton fin&quot; after the Hoxton district of London, where it was fashionable in the 1990s.
*A euro-hawk is a fauxhawk where the hair down the center of the head is longer than the hair on the sides. Sometimes the top of the hair is long enough to cover up the shorter sides when combed down. Some sports figures and fashion models can be found wearing euro-hawks in various lengths, textures, and colors. The mohawk had been a style mostly seen on punk rockers and the like, but fauxhawks and euro-hawks have become more broadly popular. The ponyhawk or pony hawk is a type of euro-hawk created by a row of ponytails going down the middle of the head. This look was worn by contestant Sanjaya Malakar on an episode of the television series &quot;American Idol&quot;.

<text>The term &quot;illiberal democracy&quot; describes a governing system that hides its &quot;nondemocratic practices behind formally democratic institutions and procedures&quot;. There is a lack of consensus among experts about the exact definition of illiberal democracy, however, it may be used broadly to refer to the notion that some governments attempt to look like democracies while suppressing opposing views.

The rulers of an illiberal democracy may ignore or bypass constitutional limits on their power. While liberal democracies protect individual rights and freedoms, illiberal democracies do not. Elections in an illiberal democracy are often manipulated or rigged, being used to legitimize and consolidate the incumbent rather than to choose the country&#x27;s leaders and policies.

According to jurist András Sajó, illiberal democracy should be counted as a type of democracy because it is &quot;democratic in a plebiscitarian sense&quot;, while political scientist Ulrich Wagrandl argues that &quot;illiberal democracy is actually more true to democracy’s roots&quot;. Other theorists say that classifying illiberal democracy as democratic is overly sympathetic to the illiberal regimes, and therefore prefer terms such as electoral authoritarianism, competitive authoritarianism, or soft authoritarianism.

== Origin and description ==
The term and concept of &quot;illiberal democracy&quot; derive from the 1995 book &quot;Towards Illiberal Democracy in Pacific Asia&quot;. Challenging Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s end-of-history thesis that political history was culminating in the global rule of capitalist liberal democracy, the book countered that Pacific Asia was not converging on liberal democracy but had instead taken an illiberal turn. Political philosopher Daniel A. Bell contributed a chapter on Confucianism as offering an alternative, illiberal approach to democracy.

The term illiberal democracy was then used and popularized by Fareed Zakaria in a regularly cited 1997 article in the journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. According to Zakaria, illiberal democracies are increasing around the world and are increasingly limiting the freedoms of the people they represent. Zakaria points out that in the West, electoral democracy and civil liberties (of speech, religion, etc.) go hand in hand. But around the world, the two concepts are coming apart. He says that democracy without constitutional liberalism is producing centralized regimes, the erosion of liberty, ethnic competition, conflict, and war. Recent scholarship has addressed why elections, institutions commonly associated with liberalism and freedom, have led to such negative outcomes in illiberal democracies. Hybrid regimes are political systems in which the mechanism for determining access to state office combines both democratic and autocratic practices. In hybrid regimes, freedoms exist and the opposition is allowed to legally compete in elections, but the system of checks and balances becomes inoperative.

Regime type is important for illiberal democracies. This is because illiberal democracies can rise from both consolidated liberal democracies and authoritarian states. Zakaria initially wrote his paper using the term illiberal democracy interchangeably with pseudo-autocracies but today they are used to describe countries that are potentially democratically backsliding as well. Below it is explained how illiberal democracies—in this case autocratic regimes—may try to demonstrate false liberal tendencies in order to consolidate their regime.

According to Marlène Laruelle, there are &quot;significant differences between illiberalism and conservatism&quot; as it has been &quot;traditionally understood&quot;
Author Jennifer Gandhi says that many autocrats allow elections in their governance to stabilize and reinforce their regimes. She first says that elections help leaders resolve threats from elites and from the masses by appeasing those capable of usurping power with money and securing the cooperation of the general public with political concessions. Gandhi also claims that illiberal elections serve other useful purposes, such as providing autocrats with information about their citizens and establishing legitimacy both domestically and in the international community, and that these varied functions must be elucidated in future research. One example of the regime durability provided by illiberal democracy is illustrated in Mubarak&#x27;s Egyptian regime. Lisa Blaydes shows that under Mubarak&#x27;s lengthy rule, elections provided a mechanism through which elites bought votes to support the government (through distributing needed goods and resources to the public) to acquire regime-enforced parliamentary immunity. This enabled them to accumulate illicit wealth and draw from state resources without legal consequence. Such research suggests that, given the stability-providing function of illiberal elections, states governed under illiberal democracies may have low prospects for a transition to a democratic system protected by constitutional liberties.

In order to discourage this problem and promote the development of liberal democracies with free and fair elections, Zakaria proposes that the international community and the United States must promote gradual liberalization of societies. Zakaria advances institutions like the World Trade Organization, the Federal Reserve System, and a check on power in the form of the judiciary to promote democracy and limit the power of people which can be destructive. Illiberal democratic governments may believe they have a mandate to act in any way they see fit as long as they hold regular elections. Lack of liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly make opposition extremely difficult. The rulers may centralize powers between branches of the central government and local government (exhibiting no separation of powers). Media are often controlled by the state and strongly support the regime. Non-governmental organizations may face onerous regulations or simply be prohibited. The regime may use red tape, economic pressure, imprisonment or violence against its critics. Zakaria believes that constitutional liberalism can bring democracy, but not vice versa.

== Types ==
There is a spectrum of illiberal democracies: from those that are nearly liberal democracies to those that are almost openly dictatorships. One proposed method of determining whether a regime is an illiberal democracy is to determine whether &quot;it has regular, free, fair, and competitive elections to fill the principal positions of power in the country, but it does not qualify as Free in Freedom House&#x27;s annual ratings of civil liberties and political rights.&quot; A 2008 article by Rocha Menocal, Fritz and Rakner describes the emergence of illiberal democracies and discusses some of their shared characteristics. Rocha Menocal, Fritz, and Rakner try to draw the similarity between illiberal democracies and hybrid regimes. The authors make the case that the &quot;democratic optimism&quot; in the 1990s—following the collapse of the Soviet Union—has led to the emergence of hybrid regimes holding illiberal values. Initially, the Western powers assumed that democratic consolidation would occur automatically and disregarded the alternatives. In reality, the non-consolidation of democracy has led to the rise of hybrid regimes that possess &quot;illiberal values&quot;.

== Cases of illiberalism ==

=== Hungary ===
In a 2014 speech, after winning re-election for the first time, Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary described his views about the future of Hungary as an &quot;illiberal state&quot;. In his interpretation the &quot;illiberal state&quot; does not reject the values of the liberal democracy, rather modern social liberalism, calling it corrupt and unfair and states that the country should work as a community. Orbán listed Singapore, Russia, Turkey, and China as examples of economically &quot;successful&quot; nations, &quot;none of which is liberal and some of which aren’t even democracies.&quot;

=== Slovakia ===
In 1995 Slovak journalists coined the term &quot;Democracy of the Carpathian type&quot; to describe the illiberal democracy of Vladimír Mečiar&#x27;s government in the 1990s. Today, the term is often used in connection with the policies of Robert Fico&#x27;s government, which has been criticised for censorship of criticism of government politicians in media, abolition of the special prosecutor&#x27;s office, politically motivated abolition of the Radio and Television of Slovakia by Slovak Television and Radio, unjustified exchanges in various expert positions, the cover-up of the accident of government politician Andrej Danko, etc.). The previous cabinet of Robert Fico was accused of organised corruption and some politicians were directly or indirectly linked to the kidnapping of Vietnamese businessman Trịnh Xuân Thanh and to the assassination of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée.

=== India ===
Indian-American journalist Fareed Zakaria claimed that India was the largest illiberal democracy in the world, in his book &quot;The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad&quot;.

=== Turkey ===
In a 2015 CNN reportage, Zakaria said that Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had become a textbook case of illiberal democracy. Erik Meyersson observed that using Freedom House’s measure of liberty, Turkey took the last place among electoral democracies in 2015, scoring worse on the liberty measure than some countries that are not even considered electoral democracies.

=== Philippines ===
Since 2016, the Philippines under presidents Rodrigo Duterte and Bongbong Marcos has been described as being in an illiberal democracy. It has been described as a worldwide capital and stronghold of illiberalism culturally and politically. 

=== United States ===
In the United States, the Republican Party has in recent years faced criticism that it is becoming increasingly illiberal under the leadership of Donald Trump, who was elected president in 2016 and 2024. According to a 2020 study by the V-Dem Institute, the Republican Party has become more illiberal and populist in the last decade with a large increase under the leadership of Donald Trump. Trump&#x27;s populist style of governance has been considered by some to be a dangerous risk to the heart of liberal democracy, as well as indifference towards traditional democratic allies and praising other &quot;strongman rulers&quot; in the world like Putin.

== Relationship with populism ==
With the different types and different examples of illustrations discussed, a key component in the rise of illiberal democracies today is populism. Current populist leaders—especially within Western states—have the tendency to promote illiberal values, a notable example being the exclusion of immigrants and openly xenophobic statements. This wave has been labeled as &quot;xenophobic populism&quot;.

Authors Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser discuss the role of populism in deteriorating liberal democracies. Within the article, Mudde and Kaltwasser say that populism—although surrounded by negative connotations—is democratic in nature, as it gives a voice to the people and heavily follows the idea of majoritarian rule. The problem arises within liberal democracies, as the authors say that liberal values and democracy internally contradict each other. Democracy promises majoritarian rule while liberal values promise the protection of minorities. Furthermore, it is said that populism is a product of democracy, but in general populist leaders try to use the democratic aspect of liberal democracies to undermine liberalism. This is closely related to Zakaria&#x27;s argument. The authors try to establish the idea that the rise of populism is undermining liberal values as populism at its core rejects plurality and minority protection—often the evident liberal values.

Moreover, Sheri Berman supports that idea that democracy being unchecked by liberalism can lead to populist—and in some regards dangerous—rule, but further says that liberal values unchecked by democracy can be just as dangerous, as she says, through the use of historical examples, this can lead to oligarchic rule. Berman takes a different perspective on the role of populism and says that it is rather the weakening of democratic institutions that has led to the rise of populism and the deterioration of liberal democracies. When discussing this matter, Berman through the example of Western states—United States and Europe—has attributed the cause of populist backlash to national government disregarding the interests of average citizens for business elites. In sum, Berman is trying to demonstrate that populism has led to the rise of illiberal democracies, while the populism has gained traction as a result in democratic institutions being too elite-led.

== Criticism ==
Writers such as Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way reject the concept of an illiberal democracy, saying it only &quot;muddies the waters&quot; on the basis that if a country does not have opposition parties and an independent media, it is not democratic. They say that terms like &quot;illiberal democracy&quot; are inappropriate for some of these states because the term implies that these regimes are at their heart democracies that have gone wrong. Levitsky and Way say that states such as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under Slobodan Milošević, Zimbabwe and post-Soviet Russia were never truly democratic and not developing toward democracy, but were rather tending toward authoritarian behavior despite having elections, which were sometimes sharply contested. Thus, Levitsky and Way coined a new term to remove the positive connotation of &quot;democracy&quot; from these states and distinguish them from flawed or developing democracies: &quot;competitive authoritarianism&quot;.

According to Wojciech Sadurski, &quot;illiberal democracy is largely an oxymoron&quot; in Poland under Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, because &quot;[b]y dismantling various checks and balances, and the many democratic institutions related to elections and judicial review, the ruling party greatly weakens the democratic character of the state&quot;. Sadurski prefers the term &quot;plebiscitarian authoritarianism&quot;.

In 1998, author Marc Plattner said that democracy and liberalism have a turbulent relationship, where throughout history they constantly repel and attract one another. Plattner believes that the rise of illiberal democracies is merely part of a democratization cycle, where states democratizing will often shift from liberal to illiberal tendencies. From this, Plattner believes that through the careful assistance of consolidated democracies these &#x27;illiberal democracies&#x27; can slowly push themselves out of this cycle.

According to a study by George Washington University political scientist Michael K. Miller, multiparty autocratic elections predict significantly better outcomes on health, education, gender equality, and basic freedoms relative to non-electoral autocracy. Effects on health and education are as strong as those of democracy and are significantly better than in non-electoral autocracy.

<doc id="907949" wikidata="Q576505" url="?curid=907949" title="Bulworth">
<text>Bulworth is a 1998 American political satire black comedy film co-written, co-produced, directed by, and starring Warren Beatty. It co-stars Halle Berry, Oliver Platt, Don Cheadle, Paul Sorvino, Jack Warden, and Isaiah Washington. The film follows the title character, California Senator Jay Billington Bulworth (Beatty), as he runs for re-election while trying to avoid a hired assassin. The film received generally positive reviews and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay yet narrowly failed to break even on a $30 million budget. However, Beatty was praised for tackling race, poverty, dysfunction in the health care system, and corporate control of the political agenda, with eminent legal scholar Patricia J. Williams noting the film examined &quot;racism&#x27;s intersection with America&#x27;s deep, and growing, class divide.&quot;

==Plot==
Jay Bulworth, a Democratic U.S. Senator from California, faces a primary challenge from a fiery young populist. Once politically liberal, Bulworth has over time conceded to more conservative politics and to accepting donations from large corporations. While he and his wife have been having affairs with each other&#x27;s knowledge for years, they maintain a happy facade for the sake of their public image. Tired of politics and unhappy with life, Bulworth makes plans to kill himself, and negotiates a $10 million life insurance policy with his daughter as the beneficiary. Knowing that a suicide would void the policy, he contracts to have himself assassinated within two days.

He arrives extremely drunk at a Los Angeles campaign event, where he freely speaks his mind in the presence of the C-SPAN film crew following his campaign. After dancing all night in an underground club and smoking marijuana, he begins rapping in public. His frank, offensive remarks make him an instant media darling and re-energize his campaign. He becomes romantically involved with Nina, a young black activist, who begins to join him on campaign stops. He is pursued by the paparazzi, his insurance company, his campaign managers, and an increasingly adoring public, all the while awaiting his impending assassination.

After a televised debate during which Bulworth derides insurance companies and the American healthcare system while drinking from a flask, he retreats to the home of Nina&#x27;s family in impoverished South Central Los Angeles. He witnesses a group of children selling crack and intervenes to rescue them from an encounter with a racist police officer, and later discovers they work for L.D., a local drug kingpin to whom Nina&#x27;s brother owes money. Bulworth eventually makes it to a television appearance arranged earlier by his campaign manager, during which he raps and repeats verbatim statements that Nina and L.D. have told him about the lives of poor black people and their opinions of various American institutions, such as education and employment. Eventually he offers the solution that &quot;everybody should fuck everybody&quot; until everyone is &quot;all the same color,&quot; stunning the audience and his interviewer.

Bulworth spends the film fearful of a man who had been following him under the assumption that he was the assassin trying to murder him. After the man finally pushes Bulworth to complete terror, he corners Bulworth on a set at the television studio and begins photographing Bulworth with Nina, revealing himself to be simply paparazzi. Bulworth, frustrated, flees with Nina, who reveals that she is the assassin he indirectly hired (ostensibly to make the money needed to pay off her brother&#x27;s debt) and will now not carry out the job. Relieved, Bulworth falls asleep for the first time in days in Nina&#x27;s arms. He sleeps for 36 hours, during which the media speculates over his sudden absence leading up to election day. Bulworth wins the primary in a landslide, and L.D. allows Nina&#x27;s brother to work off the debt. Bulworth accepts a new campaign for the presidency during his victory speech, but is suddenly shot by Graham Crockett, an agent of the insurance company that was fearful of Bulworth&#x27;s recent push for single-payer health care, who makes a quick escape.

Bulworth&#x27;s fate is left ambiguous. The final scene shows an elderly vagrant, whom Bulworth met previously, standing alone outside a hospital. He exhorts Bulworth, who is presumably inside, to not be &quot;a ghost&quot; but &quot;a spirit&quot; which, as he had mentioned earlier, can only happen if you have &quot;a song&quot;. In the final shot of the film, he asks the same of the audience.

==Cast==
==Production==
Beatty first pitched the film in 1992 under the basic pitch of a depressed man putting a hit on himself for the life insurance before falling in love. 20th Century Fox executive Joe Roth approved of the pitch and a budget of $30 million before Beatty got to work on the point of view in politics that would take center stage for the film, with Beatty taking input from writers such as Jeremy Pikser, James Toback and Aaron Sorkin (who reportedly did a re-write on the script). Beatty, long involved in politics since his first hero of Robert Kennedy, wanted to make a film that would strike the perceived notion that politics had become too absorbed in polls and fundraising while losing sight on the issues that matters most. Beatty styled his film in hip-hop and rap because of the &quot;great comic contrast&quot; that would come from it.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was released on April 21, 1998, by Interscope Records. Buoyed by the success of the single &quot;Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)&quot; by Pras featuring Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard and Mya, which became a major international hit and peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the album peaked at number ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum in the United States.

==Critical reception==
The film generated a great deal of controversy and received a positive reception from film critics. 
On Rotten Tomatoes it has a 76% approval rating based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Star and director Beatty&#x27;s ambitious take on race and politics in 20th-century America isn&#x27;t perfect, but manages to provide more than its share of thought-provoking laughs.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 75% based on reviews from 28 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A to F.
Writing in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston observed: &quot;More than anything else, &quot;Bulworth&quot; is descended from Preston Sturges&#x27;s topical farces of the 1940s, which juxtaposed a deep belief in the promise of America with irreverent attacks on the hypocrisy of its institutions.&quot;

Patricia J. Williams saw the film three times, saying: &quot;[Beatty] knows power, if not the ghetto, and this movie is effective precisely because it takes on the issue of power... I kept going back because I am amazed by a movie this overtly left wing, fearless and eccentric.&quot; She added: &quot;Bulworth isn&#x27;t about race alone; more specifically, it&#x27;s about racism&#x27;s intersection with America&#x27;s deep, and growing, class divide.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; rated the film 19th on a list of &quot;The 34 best political movies ever made&quot;.

==Box office==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that &quot;Bulworth&quot; did &quot;extremely well&quot; on a limited release. Despite this, the film ultimately grossed just $29,202,884 worldwide at the box office.

==Accolades==
==Cultural legacy==
In 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that President Barack Obama had, in private, &quot;talked longingly of &#x27;going Bulworth,&#x27;&quot; in reference to the film.

<text>Groot-Ammers is a town in the Dutch province of South Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Molenlanden, and is located about 13 km southeast of Gouda on the southside of the Lek River.

In 2001, the town of Groot-Ammers had 2822 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.56 km², and contained 1059 residences.
The statistical area &quot;Groot-Ammers&quot;, which also includes the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 3100.

==History==
The first mention of Groot-Ammers dates back to 1042. The lords of Liesvelt built their castle around that time as one of the largest and strongest castles of the Netherlands. The surroundings of the castle, including Groot-Ammers, stood under the influence of these lords.

Willem Frederik of Nassau bought the barony of Liesvelt in 1636.

In modern times the barony of Liesvelt became the municipality of Groot-Ammers. In 1986 Groot-Ammers and bordering municipalities aggregated to form the municipality of Liesveld, which on 1 January 2019 merged with Giessenlanden to form Molenlanden.

Notably, Groot-Ammers boasts the Headquarters of International Heavy transport company Van der Vlist.

<doc id="907954" wikidata="Q605998" url="?curid=907954" title="Peter Turney">
<text>Peter Turney (September 22, 1827October 19, 1903) was an American politician, soldier, and jurist, who served as the 26th governor of Tennessee from 1893 to 1897. He was also a justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1870 to 1893, and served as the court&#x27;s Chief Justice from 1886 to 1893. During the Civil War, Turney was colonel of the First Tennessee Regiment, one of the first Tennessee units to join the Confederate Army.

As governor, Turney ended the state&#x27;s controversial convict lease system and enacted other prison reform measures. His second term was marred by the 1894 gubernatorial election, which he won only after the state&#x27;s Democratic-controlled legislature threw out thousands of votes for his opponent, Henry Clay Evans.

==Early life==

Turney was born at Jasper, Tennessee, the son of Hopkins L. Turney and Teresa Francis. His father was a prominent politician who was elected to the United States Senate in 1845 with the help of the Andrew Johnson-led &quot;Immortal Thirteen.&quot; Shortly after Peter&#x27;s birth, the Turneys moved to Winchester, Tennessee. He attended public schools in Franklin County and a private school in Nashville, and read law, initially with his father, and later (after his father was elected to the Senate) with Judge W.E. Venable. After his admission to the bar in 1848, he practiced in Winchester.

A strong Southern Democrat, Turney campaigned for John C. Breckinridge in the presidential race of 1860, and called for immediate secession after Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s victory. In February 1861, he was the pro-secession candidate from his district for a proposed state convention at which Tennessee would have considered the secession issue (his pro-Union opponent was future governor Albert S. Marks). When Tennessee voters rejected this convention and upheld the state&#x27;s ties to the Union, Turney spearheaded a movement that called for Franklin County to secede from Tennessee and join Alabama.

In the two weeks following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, as sentiments in Tennessee shifted in favor of secession, Turney raised a regiment of troops, the First Tennessee Infantry (sometimes called &quot;Turney&#x27;s First&quot; to distinguish it from a similarly-designated regiment). As Tennessee had yet to officially secede, Turney acted mostly in secret until early May, when the state aligned itself militarily with the Confederacy.

Turney&#x27;s unit arrived in Virginia on May 8, and was eventually attached to the Army of Northern Virginia. The unit took part in the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, and spent the subsequent months patrolling the Potomac River region. In 1862, the unit took part in the Shenandoah Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, and the Peninsula Campaign. At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Turney was shot in the mouth, and never returned to active fighting. While he was away recovering, his unit fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, marching with the left flank of Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Turney was given an administrative command in Florida in 1864, and remained there until the end of the war.

==Tennessee Supreme Court==

Following Tennessee&#x27;s implementation of its 1870 constitution, Turney was elected to the Tennessee Supreme Court. He was reelected in 1878 and 1886, and was elevated to Chief Justice following the latter race. Although he spent 23 years on the court, Turney issued few opinions, and those he did write have been described by legal scholars as short and confusing.

In October 1891, the Turney-led court ruled on two cases related to a labor-related uprising in Anderson County, Tennessee, known as the Coal Creek War. The Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC) had attempted to replace striking miners with convicts leased from the state, and the miners had responded by overwhelming company stockades and removing the convicts. Governor John P. Buchanan had sent the state guard into the area, and had negotiated an uneasy truce with the miners while the state considered ending the convict lease system.

In the first case, &quot;State v. Jenkins&quot;, the state had sued TCMC president B.A. Jenkins for threatening to close one of the company&#x27;s mines if the miners did not fire their checkweighman (who weighed the coal for which the miners were paid). The state argued this violated a state law that granted miners the right to an independent checkweighman. Turney ruled against the state, arguing that while the law prevented mine owners from directly firing checkweighmen, it did not prevent mine owners from closing mines should miners refuse their demands to fire checkweighmen.

In the second case, &quot;State v. Jack&quot;, a convict, William Warren (with the help of the striking miners), had filed a writ of habeas corpus challenging TCMC&#x27;s authority to hold him prisoner, arguing that the state&#x27;s primary convict lessee, Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railway Company (TCI), violated its contract with the state by subleasing convicts to TCMC. A lower court had ruled in favor of Warren, and ordered him returned to the state&#x27;s direct custody. Turney, however, overruled the lower court, arguing that the TCMC stockade was essentially a &quot;branch prison&quot; of the state, and that a convict in a state prison could not file for habeas corpus.

==Governor==

In 1892, Turney sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for governor, hoping to replace incumbent Governor Buchanan. He quickly gained the support of the party&#x27;s Bourbon and pro-business factions, who had grown frustrated with Buchanan&#x27;s handling of the Coal Creek War. Buchanan, lacking the support to win renomination, withdrew from the party to run as an independent, and Turney coasted to the party&#x27;s nomination. In the general election, Turney was elected governor with 127,247 votes to 100,629 for the Republican candidate, George Winstead, 31,515 for Buchanan, and 5,427 for Prohibition candidate Edward H. East.

Although Turney had issued rulings favorable to the convict lease system as Chief Justice, upon becoming governor, he quickly signed legislation (April 1893) that effectively ended the controversial practice. The legislation called for the construction of a state penitentiary and the purchase of coal and farm lands where inmates would work. This allowed the state to defray the costs of prison maintenance while preventing convict labor from competing with free market labor.

While Turney had resolved the convict lease issue, the Democratic Party was assailed for its ineffective response to the Panic of 1893. In the 1894 governor&#x27;s race, Republicans nominated Henry Clay Evans, a former congressman who had been gerrymandered out of office for supporting the Lodge Bill. Though Turney painted Evans as a carpetbagger, Evans ran an effective campaign, and the initial vote tally on election day indicated Evans had won with 105,104 votes to 104,356 for Turney, and 23,088 for Populist candidate A.J. Mims. The Democratic-controlled legislature, however, declared voter fraud had occurred, and negated over 23,000 votes, allowing Turney to win the election by 2,000 votes.

Turney never recovered from the fallout from the &quot;stolen&quot; election of 1894. During his second term, he began organizing the state&#x27;s centennial celebrations, but his efforts were inadequate, and the celebrations were delayed until the Summer of 1897, after he had left office.

==Later life and legacy==

Turney did not seek reelection in 1896, and did not seek public office again afterward. He died in Winchester, Tennessee, in 1903, and was buried in the Winchester City Cemetery.

The state penitentiary authorized during Turney&#x27;s administration, Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, operated from 1896 to 2009. The coal and farm lands purchased as part of the prison complex are now part of Frozen Head State Park. In tribute to Turney&#x27;s prison reform efforts, the Turney Center for Youthful Offenders (now the Turney Center Industrial Complex), which opened in 1971 in Hickman County, was named in his honor.

Turney&#x27;s brother, Joe, used his political connections to manage a chain gang for financial gain, inspiring a famous blues song, &quot;Joe Turner,&quot; which in turn inspired August Wilson&#x27;s play, &quot;Joe Turner&#x27;s Come and Gone&quot;.

==Family==

Turney married his first wife, Cassandra Garner, in 1851. They had three children. After his first wife died in 1857, he married as his second wife, Hannah Graham, in 1858. They had nine children.

<doc id="907968" wikidata="Q12061070" url="?curid=907968" title="Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa">
<text>The Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (called Waaswaaganing in Ojibwe) is a federally recognized Ojibwa Native American tribe. It had 3,415 enrolled members as of 2010. The Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation lies mostly in the Town of Lac du Flambeau in south-western Vilas County, and in the Town of Sherman in south-eastern Iron County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It has a land area of and a 2020 census resident population of 3,518. Its major settlement is the unincorporated Lac du Flambeau, which had a population of 1,845. 

Located at &quot;Waaswaagani-zaaga&#x27;igan&quot; (French: &quot;Lac du Flambeau&quot;; English: &quot;Torch Lake&quot;), the reservation of the Lac du Flambeau Band was established under the Treaty of 1854. The band had occupied this area since 1745, when it defeated the Sioux in the last battle between the peoples, driving them to the west. The Ojibwe had gradually migrated over centuries from the Atlantic coast.

With renewed self-government under a written constitution in the 20th century, the Lac du Flambeau Band have established enterprises to build on their natural resources.

==Tribal settlement==

The ancestors of the Lac du Flambeau Band and other bands moved west from the Michigan area in the 17th century into the interior of Wisconsin west and south of Lake Superior. They were called the &quot;Waaswaaganininiwag&quot; (the &quot;Torch Lake Men&quot;). French fur traders named the band and lake for the Ojibwe practice of catching fish at night on the lake by torchlight.

According to the Lac du Flambeau Band, they settled permanently in the area in 1745, led by their Chief Keeshkemun. He helped them defeat the Sioux (Dakota) that year, who had long occupied this area. The last battle between them and these Chippewa took place on Strawberry Island in the lake.

The larger competition for resources between the Dakota and the Lake Superior Chippewa had begun in 1737 and continued for nearly 100 years before the Chippewa pushed out the Dakota and the Fox tribes from the Wisconsin interior. 
The &quot;Waaswaaganininiwag&quot; constituted the eastern group of the &quot;Biitan-akiing-enabijig&quot; (Border Sitters), a sub-Nation of the &quot;Gichigamiwininiwag&quot; (the Lake Superior Men, also known as Lake Superior Chippewa). Others members of the eastern &quot;Biitan-akiing-enabijig&quot; included bands located on Pelican Lake, Lac Vieux Desert, Turtle Portage, Trout Lake and Wisconsin River.

For centuries, the lake &quot;Waaswaagani-zaaga&#x27;igan&quot; served as the trade and transportation hub for Native Americans and later colonial traders, as it connected the waterways between Lake Superior (via the Montreal River) and the Wisconsin and Flambeau rivers. Traders used the lake and rivers to pass back and forth through their far-flung network. They also had to use the Flambeau Trail to portage from Lake Superior to the Lac du Flambeau District. The trail was 45 miles long, with 120 &quot;pauses&quot; created along the path to give portagers a break, an indication of the rough country.

As part of the Lake Superior Chippewa and signatories to the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe, the bands at Pelican Lake, Turtle Portage, Trout Lake and Wisconsin River were consolidated into the Lac du Flambeau Band (&quot;Waaswaaganing&quot; in Ojibwe). As signatories to the Treaty of St. Peters of 1837, and the Treaties of La Pointe of 1842 and 1854, members of the Lac du Flambeau Band enjoy the traditional hunting, fishing and gathering practices guaranteed in these treaties.

Like other tribes, the band had much of it land allotted to individual households under the Dawes Act of the early 20th century, intended to encourage assimilation to European-American style property holding and farming. This led to the loss of tribal ownership of some of the land within the reservation.

==Strawberry Island==
In the 20th century under the Dawes Act, Strawberry Island was assigned to a tribal member as part of the allotment of tribal lands to individual households, a federal attempt to force assimilation. When he died, a non-Native family bought the island in 1910, using it for years for summer camping vacations. It has remained undeveloped since the 18th century. 

The Lac du Flambeau Band consider Strawberry Island sacred, and call it &quot;the place of the little people&quot; or spirits according to tribal tradition. They consider it the heart of their reservation. As the island was used by indigenous cultures for more than 2,000 years, the tribe wants to keep it undeveloped for its historical, cultural and spiritual significance. The band believes that warriors were buried there as the island was the last battle site between these Ojibwe and the Lakota Sioux in 1745. In 1966, an archaeological survey by a professor at Beloit College revealed that the island has human remains, and layers of artifacts dating to 200 BC.

Listed in 1978 on the National Register of Historic Places, it is described as &quot;one of the most important archeological sites in northern Wisconsin&quot; by Robert Birmingham, as state archeologist in 1995. From the 1990s onward, the tribe tried to buy the island. As lakefront property is valuable, the family and tribe were unable to agree on a price for the , which has of lakefront. The Trust for Public Land has assisted the tribe.

The owners did not concede that the island may never be developed, although one development proposal was stopped in 1996 by a building permit challenge. The tribe owns all the land surrounding the island and controlled access to it. An appeals court in 2003 affirmed the denial of the building permit, with the judge ruling that, as the island was within the boundaries of the tribe&#x27;s reservation, the band should determine its future. The case continued, as the tribe and owners sought mediation but were still unable to agree on a price.

In 2008, Bonnie Mills-Rush, manager of the LLC that owns the island, assigned a lease and control to Bill Poupart, a member of the Lac du Flambeau Band. While at time the tribe did not own the land, Poupart was given authority to determine its use and agreed on its sacred nature.

On December 23, 2013, the tribe purchased the island from the Mills family for $250,000. The tribe held a &quot;Strawberry Island Closing and Drum Ceremony&quot; at the William Wildcat Sr. Community Center on December 30, 2013, in celebration of the acquisition. The deed was signed at the ceremony, bringing to an end years of uncertainty and contention surrounding the island.

==Government==
In the 20th century, the tribe re-established its own government under a written constitution. It elects a council and president. The council establishes membership rules for the tribe, and provides government services to the reservation. It has developed a number of businesses: LDF Industries (pallet manufacturing), Ojibwa Mall, campground, fish hatchery, gas station, and cigarettes and tobacco shop. Together with the resort described below, it is working to develop enterprises that preserve and build on the natural resources of the reservation.

The tribe established the Lake of the Torches Economic Development Corporation to develop and operate the Lake of the Torches resort and casino, intended to generate revenue and also provide employment to members of the tribe. When the casino did not yield expected profits, the tribe encountered repayment difficulties with the creditors it had engaged to help finance the casino. A dispute with the casino&#x27;s creditors ensued, as they tried to take control of its assets by receivership, under the terms of the bond indenture. When the case went to court, &quot;the district court denied the motion to appoint a receiver and dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that the trust indenture was a &quot;management contract&quot; under the IGRA [Indian Gaming Regulatory Act] which lacked the required approval of the NIGC Chairman.&quot; The creditors appealed the decision.

In &quot;Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Lake of the Torches Economic Development Corporation&quot; (2011), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed that the bond indenture constituted a management contract and was invalid. It contained provisions that permitted lenders to influence the management of a tribal casino, for instance, preventing the tribe from changing operating officials without bondholder approval, and others that encroached on tribal authority, without having gained required approval of the indenture/contract by the National Indian Gaming Commission. The provisions together gave a &quot;great deal of authority in an entity other than the tribe to control the Casino&#x27;s operations,&quot; which was not in keeping with the law on Indian gaming. The Seventh Circuit decision requested additional guidance from the United States Congress and /or the National Indian Gaming Commission regarding the &quot;rules of the road&quot; for tribal casino financing.

== Lending business ==
In 2012, the Lac du Flambeau Band entered the lending business, and has subsequently set up at least 24 lending companies and websites under the corporate umbrella of LDF Holdings. As of 2024 LDF Holdings employed 170 people on or near the reservation, of whom 70% were enrolled tribal members, and profits from the tribe&#x27;s lending business are distributed to the tribe&#x27;s general fund. An annual gathering of lending staff, vendors, and prospective partners known as the Tribal Lending Summit is held each year on reservation land.

A 2024 analysis by &quot;ProPublica&quot; found that approximately 4,800 bankruptcy cases per year, one percent of all bankruptcy cases in the United States, involved a company owned by the Lac du Flambeau Band, the highest frequency of any Native American tribe involved in the payday loan industry. Companies owned by the Lac du Flambeau Band have also accumulated more than 2,200 consumer complaints routed to the Federal Trade Commission since 2019, more than any other tribe.

Since 2019, the Lac du Flambeau band has been subject to at least 40 civil lawsuits involving its lending practices, with most suits being quickly settled. In 2020, a federal class-action lawsuit was filed in Virginia against members of the Lac du Flambeau Band governing council, high-level employees of the Lac du Flambeau Band&#x27;s lending companies, as well as nontribal business partners, with the plaintiffs alleging that the defendants conspired to violate state lending laws, following a 2021 federal appeals court ruling that found that tribal lending constitutes off-reservation conduct to which state law applies. In 2024, a settlement was reached in the suit, calling for the cancellation of $1.4 billion in outstanding loans affecting approximately 980,000 people who were customers of the tribe&#x27;s lending companies, with tribal officials and their associates agreeing to pay an additional $37.4 million in cash to the plaintiffs and their lawyers.

==Reservation demographics==
As of the census of 2020, the population of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation was 3,518. The population density was . There were 3,202 housing units at an average density of . 

The Lac du Flambeau Reservation has a significant non-native population due in part to the allotment and sale of reservation lands in the early twentieth century. The racial makeup of the reservation in 2020 was 58.6% Native American, 37.3% White, 0.2% Black or African American, 0.3% from other races, and 3.5% from two or more races. Ethnically, the population was 2.7% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

According to the American Community Survey estimates for 2016-2020, the median income for a household in the reservation was $41,095, and the median income for a family was $51,538. Male full-time workers had a median income of $42,155 versus $27,563 for female workers. The per capita income for the reservation was $26,048. About 16.9% of families and 20.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.5% of those under age 18 and 8.4% of those age 65 or over. Of the population age 25 and over, 89.8% were high school graduates or higher and 24.5% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

<doc id="907976" wikidata="Q1061837" url="?curid=907976" title="Adobe Shockwave">
<text>Adobe Shockwave (formerly Macromedia Shockwave and MacroMind Shockwave) is a discontinued multimedia platform for building interactive multimedia applications and video games. Developers originate content using Adobe Director and publish it on the Internet. Such content could be viewed in a web browser on any computer with the Shockwave Player plug-in installed. MacroMind originated the technology; Macromedia acquired MacroMind and developed it further, releasing Shockwave Player in 1995. Adobe then acquired Shockwave with Macromedia in 2005. Shockwave supports raster graphics, basic vector graphics, 3D graphics, audio, and an embedded scripting language called Lingo.

During the 1990s, Shockwave was a common format for CD-ROM projectors, kiosk presentations, and interactive video games, and dominated in interactive multimedia. Various graphic adventure games were developed with Shockwave then, including &quot;The Journeyman Project&quot;, &quot;Total Distortion&quot;, &quot;Eastern Mind: The Lost Souls of Tong Nou&quot;, &quot;Mia&#x27;s Language Adventure&quot;, &quot;Mia&#x27;s Science Adventure&quot;, and the &quot;Didi &amp; Ditto&quot; series. Video game developers developed hundreds of free online video games using Shockwave, publishing them on websites such as Miniclip and Shockwave.com.

In July 2011, a survey found that Flash Player had 99% market penetration in desktop browsers in &quot;mature markets&quot; (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand), while Shockwave Player claimed only 41% in these markets. Adobe Flash and Adobe AIR are alternatives to Shockwave, with its 3D rendering capabilities, object-oriented programming language, and capacity to run as a native executable on multiple platforms.

In February 2019, Adobe announced that Adobe Shockwave, including the Shockwave Player, would be discontinued effective April 9, 2019.

==History==
===MacroMind===
Shockwave originated with the VideoWorks application developed by MacroMind for the original Apple Macintosh. Animations are initially limited to the black and white of early Macintosh screens. VideoWorks was rebranded as Director 1.0 in 1987. Director 2.2 was released in 1988, and included the Lingo scripting language with extensibility provided by Xtras. A Windows version was available in the early 1990s. Director 3.0 was the last version by MacroMind, and released in 1989 which introduced XObjects to Lingo. Shockwave Player had still not been developed, and the sole means of publishing content remained generating executable applications.

===Macromedia===
In 1992, MacroMind (now MacroMind-Paracomp) merged with Authorware Inc. and became Macromedia. As the Internet became more popular, Macromedia realized the potential for a web-based multimedia platform, and designed Shockwave Player for the leading web browser of the time, Netscape Navigator. Shockwave Player was released with Director 4.0 around 1995, and branded Shockwave Player 1.0. Its versioning has since been tied to Director&#x27;s versioning, skipping versions 2 to 4. Shockwave was now a two-part system, a graphics and animation editor known as Macromedia Director, and a player known as Macromedia Shockwave Player.

Macromedia Director quickly became the de facto production tool for the multimedia industry. By 1993 it was used to develop most Macintosh CD-ROM games, such as point-and-click graphic adventures. Throughout the 1990s Director was credited with the creation of the majority of educational CD-ROMs. It was preferred over competing applications due to its range of features, relative ease of use and Director&#x27;s ability to publish executables for both Apple and Microsoft operating systems.

A less-sophisticated alternative to Director was Apple&#x27;s HyperCard. From 1995 to 1997 a competing multimedia authoring program appeared called (from ). In 1997, was purchased and discontinued by Quark, Inc., who had its own plans into multimedia authoring with Quark Immedia.

In December 1996, Macromedia acquired FutureWave Software and its FutureSplash products. Macromedia Flash 1.0 was released shortly thereafter. Macromedia now controlled two of the three leading multimedia platforms for the web, with Java being the third.

Macromedia Director 8.5 was released in 2001 and was the first version to specifically target the video game industry. It introduced 3D capabilities, 3D text, toon shading, Havok physics, Real Video, Real Audio, integration with Macromedia Flash 5, behaviors, and other enhancements. 3D modelling programs such as LightWave, Cinema 4D, and 3D Studio Max were upgraded to export 3D models for Shockwave.

As of 2001, over 200 million people had the Macromedia Shockwave Player installed, making Shockwave a common format for online video games. Websites such as Miniclip and Shockwave.com were dedicated to Shockwave and Flash-based video games.

===Adobe===
Macromedia was acquired by Adobe Systems in 2005, and the entire Macromedia product line including Flash, Dreamweaver, Director/Shockwave, and Authorware was now handled by Adobe. Director is currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems.

The early 2000s saw a decline in the usage of Director/Shockwave as most multimedia professionals preferred Macromedia Flash and other competing platforms. After the Adobe acquisition, no new versions were released for four years.

In 2007, Adobe released Adobe Director 11, the first new release in four years. It introduced DirectX 9 native 3D rendering and the AGEIA PhysX physics engine, panel docking, QuickTime 7 support, Windows Media, RealPlayer support, Adobe Flash CS3 integration, and Unicode support. It was considered an &quot;incremental release&quot; by reviewers and the scripting editor was still considered &quot;primitive&quot;.

As of 2008, the market position of Director/Shockwave overlapped with Flash to a high degree, the only advantage of Director being its native 3D capabilities. However, with the release of Flash Player 11, GPU-based 3D rendering was now supported using Stage3D (the underlying API), Away3D or Flare3D (3D game engines). And after Adobe AIR was released, Flash programs could now be published as native applications, further reducing the need for Director.

In February 2019, Adobe announced that Adobe Shockwave, including the Shockwave Player, would be discontinued in April 2019.

==Xtras==
Xtras are plug-ins for the Lingo scripting language that enable additional functionality into a Shockwave project. Xtras are typically used to add file system I/O, hardware integration, and advanced multimedia functions. Xtras are supported and available for Adobe Director, Adobe Authorware and Adobe Freehand.

Many of Director&#x27;s own functions are implemented as Xtras. Xtras use the Macromedia Open Architecture which was designed to allow easy creation of interchangeable components between Macromedia products. Adobe maintains a list of third party Xtras.

Xtras for Microsoft Windows (32-bit) have an file extension. Xtras for Mac OS generally have an extension. The file extension * is reserved for Xtras for Microsoft Windows (16-bit).

<doc id="907980" wikidata="Q6738352" url="?curid=907980" title="Major orders">
<text>For some centuries the Catholic Church distinguished between major orders (&quot;greater orders&quot;), which the Council of Trent also called holy orders, and minor orders (lesser orders). The Catechism of the Council of Trent spoke of the &quot;several distinct orders of ministers, intended by their office to serve the priesthood, and so disposed, as that, beginning with the clerical tonsure, they may ascend gradually through the lesser to the greater orders&quot;, and stated: 
The Catechism of the Council of Trent thus repeats what is stated in chapter II of that Council&#x27;s Decree on the Sacrament of Order, using the word &quot;priest&quot; to refer both to bishops and to presbyters. In chapter IV, it uses the word &quot;priest&quot; to refer instead to presbyters alone. It thus speaks of bishops as &quot;superior to priests&quot;, and of &quot;the ordination of bishops, priests, and of the other orders&quot;. In its canon VI, it declares that in the Catholic Church &quot;there is a hierarchy by divine ordination constituted, consisting of bishops, priests, and ministers&quot;.

By his motu proprio &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; of 15 August 1972, Pope Paul VI decreed: &quot;The orders hitherto called minor are henceforth to be spoken of as &#x27;ministries&#x27;.&quot; This abandonment of the term &quot;minor orders&quot; automatically brought an end also to use of the term &quot;major orders&quot;.

The same motu proprio also decreed that the Latin Church would no longer have the major order of subdiaconate, but it permitted any episcopal conference that so desired to apply the term &quot;subdeacon&quot; to those who hold the ministry (formerly called the minor order) of &quot;acolyte&quot;. 

For the Latin Church there are thus now only three orders, as stated in the Code of Canon Law: &quot;The orders are the episcopate, the presbyterate, and the diaconate.&quot; These three orders are also referred to as &quot;sacred orders&quot; or &quot;holy orders&quot;.

<text>Grafhorst is a small city about 3 km north of Kampen, in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It received city rights in 1333 from , the Prince-Bishop of Utrecht.

It was first mentioned in 1277 as Grafhorst, and means &quot;burial height&quot;. Even though it was given city rights, it was never fortified and remained small. In 1775 and 1825, it was flooded. The economy used to be based in fishing with some agriculture culture. In 1849, it was home to 411 people. On 5 May 1849, nearly the entire city burnt down except for some farms and a couple of remote houses. In 1962, a church was built.

Grafhorst was a separate municipality until 1937, when it became a part of IJsselmuiden; it is now a part of Kampen.

<doc id="907983" wikidata="Q358665" url="?curid=907983" title="Benton McMillin">
<text>Benton McMillin (September 11, 1845 – January 8, 1933) was an American politician and diplomat. He served as the 27th governor of Tennessee from 1899 to 1903 and represented Tennessee&#x27;s 4th district in the United States House of Representatives from 1879 to 1899. He served as a diplomat during the administration of President Woodrow Wilson, initially as Minister to Peru (1913–1919) and afterward as Minister to Guatemala (1920–1921).

Known as the &quot;Democratic War Horse&quot; for his persistent campaigning on behalf of the Democratic Party, McMillin served as an elector in fourteen presidential elections from 1876 to 1932 and attended nearly every Democratic National Convention during that period. As governor, he signed anti-child labor legislation and standardized the state&#x27;s school textbooks. His attempts to create a federal income tax as a Representative led to the landmark Supreme Court decision, &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; (1895), which declared the federal income tax to be unconstitutional.

==Early life==
McMillin was born in Monroe County, Kentucky, the son of John McMillin, a wealthy planter, and Elizabeth (Black) McMillin. He attended Philomath Academy in Clay County, Tennessee, and later attended Kentucky A&amp;M (now the University of Kentucky) in Lexington. During the Civil War, McMillin supported the Confederacy, and wanted to join the Confederate Army but was unable to obtain his father&#x27;s permission. At one point, he was captured by Union forces and briefly jailed for refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance.
After the war, McMillin studied law with Judge E. L. Gardenshire in Carthage, Tennessee. He was admitted to the bar in 1871, and began practicing in Celina, Tennessee. In 1874, he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives. The following year, he was appointed by Governor James D. Porter to negotiate a territorial purchase from Kentucky. In 1877, following his term in the state legislature, he was appointed special judge of the state&#x27;s Fifth Judicial District by Governor Porter.

In 1878, McMillin was elected to the first of ten consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, defeating 4th District incumbent Haywood Y. Riddle. Throughout his 20-year tenure, McMillin opposed excess government spending, tariffs, and most of the nation&#x27;s global exploits, which he deemed imperialistic. He also opposed the Lodge Bill of 1890, which would have provided protections for black voters in the South. McMillin supported antitrust legislation and currency expansion. As a member of the House Rules Committee in the 1890s, he frequently challenged Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed.

In 1894, McMillin attached an amendment to the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act that would have established a federal income tax. The law was challenged in federal court, however, and in 1895, the Supreme Court ruled federal income taxes unconstitutional when it issued its decision in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; McMillin continued campaigning in favor of federal income taxes until the 1913 adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, which gave the federal government the power to collect income taxes.

==Governor==

In 1897, McMillin sought the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Isham G. Harris. Failing to garner any support, he then sought and successfully obtained the Democratic nomination for governor the following year in the race to succeed the popular Governor Robert Love Taylor. McMillin won by a large margin on election day, with 105,640 votes to 72,611 for Republican candidate James Alexander Fowler, 2,428 for Populist candidate W.D. Turley, and 1,722 for Prohibition candidate R.N. Richardson.

By the time McMillin ran for reelection in 1900, the state&#x27;s Republican Party had come under the control of Congressman Walter P. Brownlow. Seeking to unseat McMillin, Brownlow and his faction nominated Representative John E. McCall as the party&#x27;s candidate for governor. While the party ran a strong campaign, McMillin was easily re-elected by winning 145,708 votes to 119,831 for McCall.

During his two terms, McMillin implemented a number of progressive measures. He signed legislation authorizing counties to establish high schools and school boards and instituted a property tax to pay for school textbooks. In 1901, he signed legislation aimed at reducing child labor by increasing the state&#x27;s minimum age for employment from 12 to 14. He also finalized the state&#x27;s boundary with Virginia and set up a sinking fund to reduce the state debt.

==Later life==

After his second term as governor ended in 1903, McMillin established an insurance business in Nashville. He remained active in Democratic Party politics, however, and served as an elector in every presidential election between 1876 and 1932, with the exception of the 1916 election, and attended every Democratic National Convention during the same period, with the exception of the 1920 convention.

In 1912, a divided Democratic Party nominated McMillin as the party&#x27;s candidate for governor in the hopes of unseating Republican Ben W. Hooper. The party was divided over the prohibition issue, with one faction, the &quot;Independent Democrats&quot; (which supported statewide prohibition), having withdrawn from the party and formed a coalition (the &quot;Fusionists&quot;) with Republicans. McMillin represented the other faction, the &quot;Regular Democrats,&quot; which believed the state&#x27;s largest cities should be exempt from prohibition. He was defeated in the general election by winning just 116,610 votes to Hooper&#x27;s 124,641. One factor in the electoral loss may well have been the death of McMillin&#x27;s only son in Bristol, Tennessee, who took ill at the end of October. When the doctors lost hope, the candidate McMillin and his wife stayed at his son&#x27;s bedside for nearly a week and canceled all engagements.

In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson appointed McMillin Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Peru. Shortly after arriving in the Peruvian capital, Lima, he helped negotiate an &quot;Advancement of Peace&quot; that formalized relations between the two countries.

In 1919, McMillin was appointed Minister to Guatemala. A few months after his arrival, a revolt erupted against the unpopular President Manuel Estrada Cabrera, with Cabrera eventually surrendering to McMillin to avoid capture by supporters of Carlos Herrera. The American embassy was damaged during Herrera&#x27;s five-day bombardment of the capital. Herrera would also be deposed in a coup before the end of McMillin&#x27;s tenure.

Upon returning to Tennessee, McMillin again sought his party&#x27;s nomination for governor. His chief opponent was Clarksville farmer and public education advocate Austin Peay. Although the 77-year-old McMillin campaigned vigorously, Peay had the support of rising political boss E. H. Crump, and edged McMillin for the nomination, 63,940 votes to 59,922.

After his defeat in the 1922 campaign, McMillin returned to his insurance business. He died in Nashville on January 8, 1933, and is buried in the city&#x27;s Mount Olivet Cemetery.

==Family and influence==

McMillin married Marie Childress Brown, the daughter of Governor John C. Brown, in 1886. They had a son, John Brown McMillin (1887–1912), before she died the following year. In 1897, McMillin married Lucille Foster, a noted women&#x27;s suffragist and president of the Tennessee Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs. She served as a civil service commissioner under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s. She and McMillin had one daughter, Ellinor Foster McMillin Oliver (1898–1919).

McMillin&#x27;s brother, Joseph, was a teacher at the Montvale Academy in Celina. One of his students was future Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who later recalled Benton McMillin as one of his political mentors.

<text>The Delta River is an tributary of the Tanana River in the U.S. state of Alaska. Its name in the Ahtna language is &quot;Saas Na’ &quot;. Fed by the Tangle Lakes of the Alaska Range, the river flows north to meet the larger river near Big Delta. It is older than the Alaska Range, being formed before their uplift 30 million years ago.

In 1980, of waterways in the Delta River basin, including all of the Tangle Lakes and the main stem to within of Black Rapids became part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Of this, are designated &quot;wild&quot;, &quot;scenic&quot;, and &quot;recreational&quot;.

==Boating==
Easily accessible from the boat launch at the Tangle Lakes campground near the Denali Highway and at many points downstream along the Richardson Highway, the river can be floated in sections that vary in difficulty from Class I (easy) to Class V (extremely difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty and may require portages. The upstream stretches include four lakes and their Class II (medium) connecting channels. About downstream of the last lake, the river enters a canyon and flows over unrunnable waterfalls. A portage leads to a stretch of Class III (difficult) rapids.

Below the Class III rapids, the river continues through of Class I and II water before entering a stretch between Ann Creek and One Mile Creek known as &quot;Black Rapids&quot;. Here the difficulty is Class III rising to Class IV (very difficult) or V, followed by of Class III and then of Class I.

Author Karen Jettmar warns of dangers including &quot;sweepers, canoe fragments wrapped around rocks, bears, cold and wet weather, and high winds&quot;. She says that &quot;only experts should attempt to run Black Rapids (Class IV–V) below Mile 229 on Richardson Highway.&quot;

==Fishing==
The Tangle Lakes complex, long, that feeds the Delta River has &quot;some of the best road-accessible grayling fishing in Interior Alaska&quot;. In the deeper lakes of the system, lake trout are fairly abundant. Lakes and streams that are away from the highway and accessible only by canoe or trail are the least heavily fished. Arctic grayling fishing is also considered excellent on the upper river down to its confluence with Eureka Creek.

<doc id="907995" wikidata="Q856764" url="?curid=907995" title="Venus of Tan-Tan">
<text>The Venus of Tan-Tan (supposedly, 500,000–300,000 BP) is an alleged artifact found in Morocco. It and its contemporary, the Venus of Berekhat Ram, have been claimed as the earliest representations of the human form.

==Description==
The Venus of Tan-Tan was described by Robert G. Bednarik. The quartzite object is long, wide, and thick, weighing . It was discovered in 1999 during an archaeological survey by Lutz Fiedler, state archaeologist of Hesse, Germany, in a river terrace deposit on the north bank of the Draa River, near the bridge of the N1 national route over the Draa, about to the northeast of the Moroccan town of Tan-Tan.

No dating of the artifact nor of the deposit as a whole has been performed. Both are attributed to the Middle Acheulean, which occurs between 500,000 and 300,000 BP in this region.

The object, including its &quot;arms&quot; and &quot;legs&quot;, was created by natural geological processes. The horizontal grooves on both sides of the object seem to be formed partly naturally partly artificially (by percussion). The object also contains traces of pigment, which seems to be iron and manganese according to preliminary study.

==Interpretation==
According to Bednarik, the object has a general human-like shape. It is assumed that this shape was recognized by early humans and the object was taken as a manuport. Then its horizontal grooves were accentuated by carving with a stone tool, emphasizing the artifact&#x27;s anthropomorphous character. Possibly, a pigment was applied to further accentuate the human-like form.

==Controversy==
To date, the findings of Bednarik have not been re-examined by other scholars and, thus, his statements have been neither confirmed nor rejected. Professor Stanley Ambrose, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, has expressed an opinion (based on Bednarik&#x27;s work and without studying the object directly) that the rock&#x27;s shape was a result of natural weathering.
