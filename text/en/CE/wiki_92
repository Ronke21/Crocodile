<text>Edward Fitzgerald Beale (February 4, 1822 – April 22, 1893) was a national figure in the 19th-century United States. He was a naval officer, military general, explorer, frontiersman, Indian affairs superintendent, California rancher, diplomat, and friend of Kit Carson, Buffalo Bill Cody and Ulysses S. Grant. He fought in the Mexican–American War, emerging as a hero of the Battle of San Pasqual in 1846. He achieved national fame in 1848 in carrying to the east the first gold samples from California, contributing to the gold rush.

In the late 1850s, Beale surveyed and built Beale&#x27;s Wagon Road, which many settlers used to move to the West, and which became part of Route 66 and the route for the Transcontinental railroad. As California&#x27;s first Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Beale helped charter a humanitarian policy towards Native Americans in the 1850s. He also founded the Tejon Ranch, the largest private landholding in California, and became a millionaire several times over. He received appointments from five U.S. presidents: Andrew Jackson appointed him to the Philadelphia Naval School, Millard Fillmore appointed him Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California and Nevada, James Buchanan appointed him to survey a wagon road from New Mexico to California, Abraham Lincoln appointed him Surveyor General of California and Nevada, and Ulysses S. Grant appointed him Ambassador to Austria-Hungary.

&quot;Beale successfully pursued a personal El Dorado of adventure, status, and wealth,&quot; wrote Gerald Thompson. &quot;In doing so, he mirrored the dreams of countless Americans of his day.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Beale was born in Washington, D.C. His father, George Beale, was a paymaster in the U.S. Navy who earned a Congressional Medal for Valor in the War of 1812. His mother, Emily, was the daughter of Commodore Thomas Truxtun of the U.S. Navy. Ned was a student at Georgetown University when, at the solicitation of his widowed mother, President Andrew Jackson appointed him to the Philadelphia Naval School.

==Career==
From 1837 to 1842, Beale was an acting midshipman on naval ships that sailed to Russia, Brazil and the West Indies. He graduated from the Naval School as a midshipman in 1842, and sailed for two years in Europe and South America. In 1845, he was assigned to the squadron of Captain Robert F. Stockton, a wealthy New Jersey businessman and inventor as well as a career naval officer, who was an intimate of presidents. Beale sailed with Stockton&#x27;s squadron to Texas, where Stockton met with the Texas Congress, which accepted annexation by the United States.

After a promotion to acting master and private secretary to Stockton, Beale sailed for California and Oregon in 1845 on the USS &quot;Congress&quot;, but 20 days later Stockton instructed Beale to board a Danish ship they had encountered and sail to England, where Beale was to disguise his identity and seek information on the British feelings on the Oregon boundary. Back in Washington, D.C., in 1846, Beale reported his findings to President James Polk that the British had been making warlike preparations. Promoted to the position of master, Beale carried packages for Navy Secretary Bancroft to Stockton, sailing to Panama, crossing the isthmus by boat and mule, and then sailing to Peru to meet up with Stockton and the &quot;Congress&quot; in 1846. He sailed with Stockton to Honolulu, and then to California. Hostilities with Mexico had already begun when the vessel reached Monterey, California on July 20, 1846.

After reaching San Diego, Stockton dispatched Beale to serve with the land forces. Beale and a small body of men under Lt. Archibald Gillespie joined General Stephen W. Kearny&#x27;s column just before the Battle of San Pasqual on December 6, 1846. After the Mexican Army surrounded the small American force and threatened to destroy it, Beale and two other men (his Delaware Indian servant and Kit Carson) crept through the Mexican lines and made their way to San Diego for reinforcements. Two months later, although Beale still suffered from the effects his adventure, Stockton again sent him east with dispatches. Beale reached Washington about June 1. In October he appeared as a defense witness for John C. Frémont at the &quot;Pathfinder&#x27;s&quot; court martial.

Within the next two years, Beale made six more journeys across the country. On the second of these (July–September 1848), he crossed Mexico in disguise to bring the federal government proof of California&#x27;s gold. After the fourth journey he married Pennsylvania Representative Samuel Edwards&#x27; daughter, Mary, on June 27, 1849. They had three children: Mary (1852–1925), who married Russian diplomat George Bakhmeteff, Emily (1854–1912), who married newspaper publisher John Roll McLean, and Truxtun (1856–1936).

Beale was promoted to lieutenant in 1850. He resigned from the Navy in 1851.

Over his lifetime, Beale saw San Francisco grow from an isolated village of five houses to a city of 300,000 residents.

After leaving the Navy, Beale returned to California as a manager for William Henry Aspinwall and Commodore Robert F. Stockton, who had acquired large properties there. In 1853, President Fillmore appointed Beale Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California and Nevada. Congress appropriated $250,000 to improve native conditions in Beale&#x27;s district. On his way to California, Beale left Washington on May 6 with a party of 13 and surveyed a route across Colorado and Utah to Los Angeles, California, for a transcontinental railroad. He reached Los Angeles on August 22. Beale served as Superintendent until 1856. California Governor John Bigler appointed Beale a brigadier general in the California state militia to give Beale additional authority to negotiate peace treaties between the Native Americans and the U.S. Army.

In 1861, Beale was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as Surveyor General of California and Nevada. He had an important passage named after him due to his widening of a cut used by the Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach that operated mail between St. Louis, Missouri and San Francisco. In 1862, he dispatched a crew of Chinese workers to widen an 1858 cut, which also reduced the climb by . Beale&#x27;s Cut, as it was known, lasted as a transportation passage through the modern day Newhall Pass area until the construction of the Newhall Tunnel was completed in 1910. Still in existence today, Beale&#x27;s Cut is no longer passable by automobiles. It is difficult to find today because it is fenced off and not close enough to the Sierra Highway to be easily seen.

==Beale&#x27;s Wagon Road and Camel Corps==

In 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Beale to survey and build a wagon road from Fort Defiance, Arizona to the Colorado River, on the border between Arizona and California. The survey also incorporated an experiment for the Army using camels, first proposed by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis four years earlier. Beale used camels from the Camel Corps imported from Tunis as pack animals during this expedition and on another in 1858 through 1859 to extend the road from Fort Smith, Arkansas to the Colorado River. His lead camel driver was Hi Jolly (Hadji Ali) a Greek-Syrian convert to Islam. The camels were capable of traveling for days without water, carried much heavier loads than mules, and could thrive on forage that mules wouldn&#x27;t touch. But the camels scared horses and mules, and the Army declined to continue the experiment with camels. Nevertheless, the wagon road Beale built became a popular immigrant trail during the 1860s and 1870s, and it was this survey which marked out for the first time a practicable highway along the 35th parallel that has been used from that day to this. The general route of the Beale Wagon Road was followed by U.S. Route 66, the Santa Fe Railway, and Interstate 40.

Of this road, Beale wrote: &quot;... It is the shortest (route) from our western frontier by 300 miles, being nearly directly west. It is the most level, our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered! Our greatest distance without water at any time being twenty miles ... It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point.&quot;

&quot;In opening this highway,&quot; wrote Gerald Thompson, &quot;Beale joined the small group of explorers who left an enduring mark on the American West during the nineteenth century.&quot;

Portions of the original wagon road are still visible. Due to the notoriety of his use of camels, the route became known as the &quot;Beale Camel Trail&quot;, and today is listed on the NRHP, as the Thirty-Fifth Parallel Route.

==Tejon Ranch==

 At the urging of Beale, Fort Tejon was established by the U.S. Army in 1854, to protect and control the Indians who were living on the Sebastian Indian Reservation, and to protect both the Indians and white settlers from raids by the Paiutes, Chemehuevi, Mojave and other Indian groups of the desert regions to the east. Fort Tejon was abandoned in 1864. In 1865 and 1866, Beale purchased the Mexican land grants which now comprise the Tejon Ranch. When the U.S. Army sold its camels, Beale purchased some of them and kept them at his ranch. Tejon Ranch is the largest private landholding in California, and today is owned by Tejon Ranch Company, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange ().

==Decatur House==
In 1871, Beale purchased Decatur House, opposite the White House, in Washington, D.C. Decatur House had been built in 1818 for naval hero Stephen Decatur. Its prominent location across from the White House made Decatur House one of the capital&#x27;s most desirable addresses and home of many of the nation&#x27;s most prominent figures. The U.S. government rented Decatur House for its Secretaries of State, Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren and Judah P. Benjamin. Beale bought the house for $60,000 and extensively renovated it. He held many glittering parties there and became Washington&#x27;s most famous host. A reporter from the Washington &quot;Capital&quot; wrote in 1873 that &quot;the old Decatur mansion will again rank first among the fashionable residences of our city.&quot; Decatur House also became the unofficial meeting place for the Republican Stalwarts, and Ulysses S. Grant frequently stayed there. Beale&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Marie, bequeathed Decatur House to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1956.

==Ambassador to Austria-Hungary==
President Grant appointed Beale Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, in 1876. He served from 1876 to 1877, and displayed a talent for diplomacy. His lavish entertaining, tales of the American West, command of foreign languages, and warm personality made Beale and his wife popular figures in the Viennese court. His love of horses helped him win the trust of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. During his tenure, Beale sent frequent dispatches to the State Department on the war between Turkey and Serbia and the Eastern Question.

==Retirement==

In his retirement, Beale lived at Decatur House in Washington, D.C., with yearly visits to Tejon Ranch and more frequent visits to his horse farm at Ash Hill in Hyattsville, Maryland, northeast of Washington, D.C. At Ash Hill he entertained friends such as Grant, who kept two Arabian horses stabled there, President Grover Cleveland and Buffalo Bill Cody. Ash Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Beale died at Decatur House in 1893 and is interred at Chester Rural Cemetery in Chester, Pennsylvania. His will was witnessed by Ulysses S. Grant and General William Tecumseh Sherman.

==Legacy==
His son Truxtun Beale was a diplomat to Persia, Greece, Romania and Serbia.

==In popular culture==
The actor Stanley Lachman played Beale in two 1957 episodes, &quot;The Camel Train&quot; and &quot;The California Gold Rush in Reverse&quot; of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the former, Beale is instructed by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, played by Harry Fleer, to conduct an experiment with the use of camels in the deserts of the American Southwest. William &quot;Red&quot; Reynolds (1927-1981) was cast as mountain man Kit Carson. In the second episode, Beale attempts to be the first to return East with a sample of newly discovered California gold, but he must escape Mexican bandits to do so.

Another actor, Charles Bateman, played Beale in another &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; episode, &quot;Stubborn Mule Hill,&quot; which aired in 1963. In that episode, David McLean played Army scout Kit Carson.

Beale was played by Rod Cameron in the 1954 Western film &quot;Southwest Passage&quot;. As in &quot;The Camel Train&quot;, Beale is conducting an experiment with camels in the American Southwest, whilst at the same time surveying a new route across the desert and mountains.

<text>Brian Vahaly (born July 19, 1979) is an American former professional tennis player and a graduate of University of Virginia. He reached the quarterfinals of the 2003 Indian Wells Masters (defeating world no. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero en route) and achieved a career-high of world no. 57 in March 2003. He is currently the Chairman of the Board and President of the USTA.

==Early career==
He began playing tennis at the age of two with his parents Barry and Karen. As a junior, Brian Vahaly captured the Easter Bowl 18s title and reached the final of the Coffee Bowl in Costa Rica in 1997. His best junior Grand Slam result was reaching the quarterfinal at Wimbledon that same year, where he finished 17th in the world junior rankings.

Vahaly proceeded to play four years of collegiate tennis at the University of Virginia from 1998 to 2001, where he was a three-time All-American and finished as the school&#x27;s most successful player. In 2000, he won the United States Amateur Championships (Men&#x27;s Tennis). In 2001, Vahaly reached the singles final at the NCAA Championships, and lost in the doubles semifinal with Huntley Montgomery, but finished as the no. 1 player in doubles and no. 5 in singles (40-6).

Vahaly became UVA&#x27;s first tennis All-American in 1999 and during the previous season was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Rookie of Year. In his last two seasons, he was a two-time ACC Player of Year, and as a senior, he was named the University of Virginia Male Athlete of Year. He graduated with two majors in Finance and Business Management, and finished his career at Virginia as an Academic All-American. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame of University of Virginia Men&#x27;s Tennis.

==Professional career==
In 2002, Vahaly enjoyed a breakthrough season on the ATP circuit, advancing to the semifinals of Memphis (falling to Andy Roddick) and the quarterfinals of Indian Wells. He defeated three top 10 ranked players Fernando González, (2003 French Open Champion and former world no. 1) Juan Carlos Ferrero, and Tommy Robredo at Indian Wells and later teamed with Andy Roddick in Washington, D.C., to defeat the no. 1 ranked doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan. During the year he also posted wins over Michael Chang and Vince Spadea. Vahaly was the only college graduate in the top 100 in the world and was recognized by &quot;People&quot; magazine in its issue of the 25 Hottest Bachelors. In March 2003, he reached his career high singles ranking of world no. 57.

In 2004-2007, Vahaly spent most of the year on the ATP circuit playing events in Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Newport, Houston, Indian Wells, San Jose, Adelaide, and the Australian Open (losing to finalist Marat Safin).

Vahaly played his last tournament at the U.S. Open losing to Juan Martín del Potro. After the tournament, Vahaly revealed that the shoulder injury had plagued him for some time. On September 7, 2007, Brian underwent surgery to repair several tears to his right rotator cuff. He had two additional surgeries later that year.

==Retirement==
In November 2007, Vahaly announced his retirement from professional tennis on his website. He had three shoulder surgeries from 2006 to 2007. He moved to Washington, D.C., to work for a private equity fund. In 2013, Vahaly began serving on the USTA board of directors and then became the chief operating officer at two different venture capital firms, Venturehouse Group and NextGen Venture Partners. Vahaly has distinguished himself as a respected chief executive with a track record of success in operational turnarounds, driving growth and improving profitability for private equity-backed, early-stage companies in the health and wellness sector. Vahaly has recently elected to serve as the Chairman of the Board and President of the USTA and US Open for the 2025-2026 term.

== Personal life ==
Vahaly came out as gay in 2017 in a podcast. He is married to Bill Jones, with whom he is raising two twin boys. He is one of very few out male professional tennis players, and the first gay man to publicly come out after playing on the ATP Tour.

==ATP Challenger and ITF Futures finals==

===Singles: 15 (10–5)===

<text>The Valmet L-90 Redigo is a turboprop-powered military basic trainer aircraft and liaison aircraft, a development of Valmet&#x27;s earlier training aircraft for the Finnish Air Force. The L-90 was the last military aircraft designed and produced in Finland.

==Design and development==
The prototype, a modified L-80, first flew on February 12, 1985. A second prototype, powered by a Turbomeca TP319 turboprop, was destroyed in an accident in August 1988. A total of 29 production aircraft plus the 2 prototypes were produced. Aermacchi purchased the manufacturing rights in 1996 but never returned the aircraft to production.

The aircraft is of conventional configuration, with retractable tricycle gear and a low wing. The student and instructor sit side-by-side. As is typical with many military trainers, it can also carry light armament for weapons training, or potentially, for use in a close-support role. The Finnish Air Force only used the L-90 as a liaison aircraft.

==Operators==
;: Eritrean Air Force 6 retired
;: Finnish Air Force, 10 units, the whole fleet retired
;: Mexican Navy 7, all of them currently retired

<doc id="933623" wikidata="Q7773761" url="?curid=933623" title="Watusi (dance)">
<text>The Watusi is a solo dance that enjoyed brief popularity during the early 1960s. It was one of the most popular dance crazes of the 1960s in the United States. &quot;Watusi&quot; is a former name for the Tutsi people of Africa, whose traditions include spectacular dances. The naming of the American dance may have been inspired, in particular, by a scene in the 1950 film &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; which featured Tutsi dancers, or by its sequel &quot;Watusi&quot;.

== History ==
The Orlons, a vocal quartet from Philadelphia, had the biggest hit of their career as recording artists with their recording of &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot; (Cameo 218), which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on June 9, 1962, and remained on the Hot 100 for 14 weeks; it peaked at #2 and held the position for two weeks. On the R&amp;B chart, the single peaked at #5.

This was not the only version of the song to hit the charts. On January 18, 1963, Chubby Checker released his single version of &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot; (B-side of Cameo 221). Later that year, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles also recorded their own version. Popular covers of the song included those by Annette Funicello and The Isley Brothers. The Vibrations had previously released an R&amp;B single in 1961 called &quot;The Watusi&quot; (US #25).

Also in 1963, Puerto Rican jazz musician Ray Barretto had his first hit with a song called &quot;El Watusi&quot;, and—although he didn&#x27;t invent the dancing style—he came to be typecast as connected to the style. Barretto&#x27;s recording, &quot;El Watusi&quot; (Tico 419), debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on April 27, 1963, and remained on the Hot 100 for 9 weeks; it peaked at #17 for 9 weeks. The Ventures covered Barretto&#x27;s version on their 1965 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!&quot;.

The &quot;Monkey Watusi&quot; is mentioned in the 1964 single &quot;Hey Harmonica Man&quot; by Stevie Wonder. &quot;The Watusi&quot;, along with &quot;The Twist&quot;, is mentioned in the fragmentary &quot;lyrics&quot; of the Beatles&#x27; sound collage &quot;Revolution 9&quot;. &quot;The Watusi&quot; is also mentioned in Chris Kenner&#x27;s song &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;.

&quot;The Watusi&quot; was one of the inspirations for the Exodus song &quot;The Toxic Waltz&quot;, from their 1989 album &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot;.

The &quot;Watusi&quot; is also mentioned in a song by The Go-Go&#x27;s titled &quot;We Got The Beat&quot;.

The dance was central to &quot;We Love You Miss Pringle.&quot; That 26th episode of the second season of the &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; television series first aired March 28, 1965. It was also referenced in the 1967 movie &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; in a light-hearted conversation, between Matt Drayton and John Prentice, about black teenagers dancing. It was also referenced in the 33rd episode of the first season of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, &quot;Lurch the Teenage Idol&quot;, first aired May 21, 1965.

<text>Vibhajyavāda (Sanskrit; Pāli: &quot;Vibhajjavāda&quot;; ) is a term applied generally to groups of early Buddhists belonging to the Sthavira Nikāya, which split from the Mahāsāṃghika (due either to the former attempting to make the Vinaya stricter, or the latter wishing to reform it; see: Sthavira Nikāya main article) into two main groups: the Sarvāstivāda and the Vibhajyavāda, of which the latter are known to have rejected both Sarvāstivāda doctrines (especially the doctrine of &quot;all exists&quot;) and the doctrine of Pudgalavada (personalism). During the reign of Ashoka, these groups possibly took part in missionary activity in Gandhara, Bactria, Kashmir, South India and Sri Lanka. By the third century CE, they had spread in Central Asia and South-East Asia. Their doctrine is expounded in the &quot;Kathavatthu.&quot;

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The word &quot;Vibhajyavāda&quot; may be parsed into &quot;vibhajya&quot;, loosely meaning &quot;dividing&quot;, &quot;analyzing&quot; and &quot;vāda&quot; holding the semantic field: &quot;doctrine&quot;, &quot;teachings&quot;. According to Andrew Skilton, the analysis of phenomena (Skt. &quot;dharmas&quot;) was the doctrinal emphasis and preoccupation of the Vibhajyavādins.

According to A.K. Warder, they are called &quot;distinctionists&quot; because they make distinctions between dhammas that exist in the present and the past, and dhammas that don&#x27;t exist in the past and the future (as opposed to Sarvāstivāda). This is supported by the explanation given by the 6th century Mahayana philosopher Bhavaviveka.

According to Bhante Sujato, &quot;Vibhajyavāda&quot; means that the doctrine &quot;distinguishes&quot; (&quot;vibhajanto&quot;) the heterodox and orthodox views, particularly the non-Buddhist theory of a self (&quot;atman&quot;) as well as the theory of a &quot;pudgala&quot; (or &quot;person&quot; similar to but distinct from the &quot;atman&quot;) of the Pudgalavadins (also known as the Vātsīputrīya). The characteristic method used by the Buddha and early Buddhists to break down the idea of self was the method of analyzing (&quot;vibhajjati&quot;) the components of a person and investigating them to find that they do not possess the features that one could ascribe to a self. Thus, it would make sense that the term refers to &quot;the Abhidhamma movement as an analytic approach to Dhamma in general, and as a critique of the ‘self’ in particular&quot;.

==Overview==
The Vibhajyavādins are a group of early Buddhist schools. According to the Theravada account, this group rejected the Sarvastivada teachings at the third Buddhist council (however modern scholars question the council narratives). The name means &quot;those who make distinctions,&quot; and include the &quot;Kāśyapīya&quot;, &quot;Mahīśāsaka&quot; and &quot;Dharmaguptaka&quot;. The Vibhajyavādins were strongly represented in south India, where they called themselves &quot;Theriyas.&quot; They survived until the seventeenth century in south India, and in Sri Lanka they became the Theravadins.

The Vibhajyavādins rejected the Sarvāstivāda claim that all dhammas (principles, phenomena) exist in the past, present and future. Instead, they made a distinction between dhammas that &quot;exist&quot; and dhammas that do not exist, hence the name &quot;distinctionists.&quot; The Vibhajyavādins held that dhammas exist in the present, but not that they exist in the future. With regards to past dhammas, those wholesome or unwholesome dhammas that had already brought forth its fruit or effect were said not to exist, but those which had not yet brought forth a karmic effect could be said to have some efficacy. The Sarvāstivāda &quot;Vijñānakāya&quot; states their position as defended by Moggaliputtatissa as: &quot;The past and future are not; the present and the unconditioned exist.&quot;

The Vibhajyavādins also held that out of all dhammas, only Nirvana was an unconditioned (&quot;asankhata&quot;) dhamma, against the view of the Sarvāstivāda which also held that space was an unconditioned dhamma. Another difference with the Sarvāstivāda hinged on the issue of gradual versus sudden attainment. The Vibhajyavādins held that at stream entry, understanding of the Four Noble Truths came at once (&quot;ekābhisamaya&quot;), while the Sarvāstivāda asserted that this happened only gradually (&quot;anupubbābhisamaya&quot;). Vibhajyavādins also asserted that arhats could not regress or fall back to a lower state once they attained arhatship. The Vibhajyavādins also rejected the doctrine of the intermediate state between rebirths (&quot;antarabhava&quot;).

Doctrines of the Vibhajyavādins can be seen in the &quot;Kathāvatthu,&quot; traditionally attributed to elder Moggalipputtatissa by the Theravada&quot;.&quot; The earliest layer of this text could date as far as the reign of Ashoka. However, neither the Theravādin &quot;Kathāvatthu&quot; nor the Sarvāstivāda &quot;Vijñānakāya&quot; contain any reference to Vibhajyavāda as a separate school, indicating that perhaps during the time they were recorded there was not yet a formal schism between the Sarvāstivāda and the Vibhajyavāda.

The Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa, a fifth century Sri Lankan work meanwhile, mentions that the Visuddhimagga was written at the request of Sanghaphala, &quot;a member of the lineage of the Mahaviharasins, illustrious Theriyas, best of Vibhajjavādins&quot;.

== Branches ==

The Vibhajyavādins are not recorded uniformly by early Buddhist traditions as being a distinct sect, nor being associated with any one period of time. Some scholars believe that there was no separate &quot;Vibhajyavāda&quot; sect, but that the term &quot;vibhajyavāda&quot; was sometimes affixed to the name of a school to indicate that it differed from the main school on some doctrines. In this sense, they would be &quot;vibhajyavādins&quot; of that particular school.

The name was applied to a variety of communities across the Indian subcontinent. The major ones were:

# Dharmaguptaka, located mainly in the North-West of the Indian subcontinent but also spreading along the Central Asian trade routes. According to Richard Salomon, this school was involved in missionary activity and was dominant in Gandhara during the first century CE.
# Kāśyapīya, probably located in the same area as the Dharmaguptaka.
# Mahīśāsaka, as above but also in other parts of mainland India.
# Tambapaṇṇiya (Skt. Tamraparṇiyas, later known as Mahāvihāravāsins and Theravada), established in Sri Lanka (at Anuradhapura) but active also in Andhra and other parts of South India (Vanavasa in modern Karnataka) and later across South-East Asia. Inscriptional evidence has been found in Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda.

Bhante Sujato, in his overview of Dharmaguptaka and Mahāvihāravāsin schools, argues that the split between them was not due to any difference in doctrine or monastic discipline, but due to geographical distance.

According to LS Cousins, the precursor to these schools was probably involved in missionary activity around the time of Ashoka into the regions of Kashmir, Gandhara, Bactria, Andhra and Sri Lanka. Cousins concludes:

==Sectarian views==
The Mahavihara Theravādins of Sri Lanka are descendants of the Sthavira Vibhajyavādins in South India who used the Pali language, differing somewhat from the northern Sthavira schools. The Theravādins hold that Vibhajyavāda was the favored doctrine during a Buddhist council that took place in Pataliputra under Ashoka. As Gethin notes, the sources are rather confused on this matter however.

The Sammatīyas (aka &quot;Pudgalavadins&quot;) also mention the Vibhajyavādins. According to the Sammatīya sect, the Vibhajyavādins developed from the Sarvāstivāda school.

The Sarvāstivādin &quot;Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra&quot; describes the Vibhajyavādins as being the type of heretics who &quot;make objections, who uphold harmful doctrines and attack those who follow the authentic Dharma&quot;.

The Mahāsāṃghika saw the Vibhajyavādins as being offshoots from the root schism in Buddhism, which according to them produced three sects: the Sthaviras, the Mahāsāṃghikas, and the Vibhajyavādins. The Mahāsāṃghikas list the Mahīśāsaka, Dharmaguptaka, Kāśyapīya, and Tāmraparnīya (Theravada) sects as having descended from the Vibhajyavādins. The Mahāsāṃghika branch itself, together with the Prajñaptivāda, preferred to be called Bahuśrutiya-Vibhajyavādins.

<text>The Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739 between Russia and the Ottoman Empire was caused by the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s war with Persia and the continuing raids by the Crimean Tatars. The war also represented Russia&#x27;s ongoing struggle for access to the Black Sea. In 1737, the Habsburg monarchy joined the war on Russia&#x27;s side, known in historiography as the Austro-Turkish War of 1737–1739.

==Russian diplomacy before the war==
By the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War, Russia had successfully secured a favorable international situation. This was achieved through the signing of treaties with the Persian Empire from 1732 to 1735 (which was engaged in a conflict with the Ottoman Empire from 1730 to 1735) and by supporting the accession of Augustus III to the Polish throne in 1735, instead of Stanislaw Leszczynski, who had been nominated by pro-Ottoman France. Austria had been Russia&#x27;s ally since 1726.

==Initial stage of the war in 1735–1736==
The casus belli was the raids of the Crimean Tatars on the Cossack Hetmanate at the end of 1735 and the Crimean Khan&#x27;s military campaign in the Caucasus. In 1736, the Russian commanders envisioned the seizure of Azov and the Crimean Peninsula.

In 1735, on the eve of the war, Russia made peace with Persia, returning all the remaining territory conquered during the Russo-Persian War (Treaty of Ganja).

On 20 May 1736, the Russian Dnieper Army (62,000 men), under the command of Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich, stormed the Crimean fortifications at Perekop and occupied Bakhchysarai on June 17. The Crimean khans failed to defend their territory and repel the invasion. In 1736, 1737, and 1738, Russian expeditionary armies broke through their defensive positions, pushing deep into the Crimean peninsula, driving the Tatar noblemen into the hills and forcing Khan Fetih II Giray to take refuge at sea. They burned Gozlev, Karasubazar, and the khan&#x27;s palace in the Crimean capital, Bakhchysarai. Additionally, they captured the Ottoman fortress at Azov.

Khans Qaplan I Giray and Fetih II Giray were deposed by the Ottoman sultan Mahmud I for their incompetence. However, the years 1737 to 1739 were notable plague years, and all sides of the conflict were crippled by disease and unsanitary conditions. Despite his success and a string of battlefield victories, the outbreak of an epidemic coupled with shortages forced Münnich to retreat to Ukraine.

On 19 June 1736, the Russian Don Army of 28,000 men, under the command of General Peter Lacy, with support from the Don Flotilla under the command of Vice Admiral Peter Bredahl, seized the fortress of Azov. The Crimean campaign of 1736 ended with Russian withdrawal into Ukraine, resulting in an estimated 30,000 lives lost. Only 2,000 of these losses were related to war, while the rest were due to disease, hunger, and famine. In July 1737, Münnich&#x27;s army stormed the Turkish fortress of Ochakov. Lacy&#x27;s army, already 40,000 men strong, marched into Crimea the same month and captured Karasubazar (see Lacy&#x27;s campaign to Crimea). However, Lacy and his troops had to leave Crimea due to a lack of supplies.

==The course of the war in 1737–1738==
In July 1737, the Habsburg monarchy entered the war against the Ottoman Empire. Initial incurson of Habsburg armies into Ottoman Serbia resulted in the capture of Niš, that was followed by the pro-Habsburg Serbian uprising against the Ottoman rule. On the western section of the front, Habsburg armies were defeated at the Battle of Banja Luka on 4 August 1737. There were no significant military operations in 1738. The Russian Army had to leave Ochakov and Kinburn due to a plague outbreak. In August, Russia, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire began negotiations in Nemirov, which would turn out to be fruitless. 

According to an Ottoman Muslim account of the war translated into English by C. Fraser, Bosnian Muslim women fought in battles, having &quot;acquired the courage of heroes&quot; against the Austrian Germans at the siege of Osterwitch-atyk (Östroviç-i âtık) fortress. Women also fought in the defense of the fortresses of Būzin (Büzin) and Chetin (Çetin). Their bravery was also described in a French account. Yeni Pazar, Izvornik, Gradişka, and Banaluka were also struck by the Austrians.

==The final stage of the war in 1739==
In the summer of 1739, the Russian army, commanded by Field Marshal Münnich, crossed the Dniester river by the late July, defeated the Turks at the Battle of Stavuchany on , and occupied the fortresses of Khotyn on . Proceeding further, Münnich crossed the Prut river by , while his advance units, headed by young Constantine Cantemir, son of late Antioch Cantemir, former Prince of Moldavia (d. 1726), reached Iași, the capital city of the Principality of Moldavia on . Münnich entered Iași on and pressed Moldavian boyars to accept the annexation of Moldavia on .

However, main Habsburg army suffered a strategic defeat at the Battle of Grocka near Belgrade, on 21-22 July. Field marshal Wallis retreated into Belgrade Fortress, while Turks laid the siege of the city. Already on 31 July, the imperial government in Vienna decided to relieve Wallis of his previously granted powers to negotiate with the Ottomans, and those powers were consequently transferred to count Neipperg, who arrived at Belgrade on 16 August, and then proceeded to the camp of the Grand Vizier on 18 August, thus initiating peace negotiations. There he found himself isolated, and dependent on the French mediator, marquis Louis Sauveur de Villeneuve. On 1 September, Neipperg agreed to sign a preliminary peace agreement with the Ottomans that included the loss of Belgrade, not knowing that his original instructions were no longer valid, since the imperial government in Vienna in the meantime decided not to surrender the city, and wait for the outcome of the Russian campaign in Moldavia. News on the conclusion of the preliminary peace treaty reached Vienna on 7 September, but it was too late for reversal. On 18 September, the final peace Treaty of Belgrade was signed, thus confirming Habsburg loss of Wallachia Minor (Oltenia), central Serbia with Belgrade, and the Bosnian section of Posavina. 

Using mediating powers granted to him by the Russian court, Villeneuve also negotiated a separate Russo-Turkish preliminary peace treaty, that was signed on the same day (18 September) in Belgrade. Faced with the threat of a possible Swedish invasion, and consequent Ottoman alliances with Sweden, Poland, and Prussia, Russian government decided to accept terms that were reached through the French mediation. On 3 October, the final Russo-Turkish Treaty of Niš was signed, thus ending the Russo-Ottoman war. The Azak Fortress was demolished and its lands were turned into neutral territory as it became a centre of attack in line with the demands for access to the Black Sea. And consolidated Russia&#x27;s control over the Zaporizhia in exchange for Russia abandoning its claims to Crimea and Moldova. For Austria, the war proved a stunning defeat. The Russian forces were much more successful on the field, but they lost tens of thousands to disease. The Russians had access to the Black Sea but were not allowed to maintain any fleet in the Azov and Black Sea.

==Military details==
This section summarizes Davies and Amin in sources.

===Geography===
The Ottoman Empire held forts along the north shore of the Black Sea and on the eastern side of the Balkans. Azov kept the Don Cossacks out of the Sea of Azov. Kaffa dominated the Crimean Khanate. Or Kapi, behind the Perekop trenches, guarded the entrance to Crimea. Ochakov, at the mouth of the Dnieper, kept the Dnieper Cossacks out of the Black Sea. Khotyn, on the upper Dniester, watched the Polish Commonwealth. The Turkish border was close to the current Ukrainian border along the Dniester. Polish claims extended to the Dnieper, except for Kiev. Russia had a very vague border about 100 or more miles south of the current border. The semi-independent Zaporozhian Cossacks were along the Dnieper bend. The Crimean Khanate and its Nogai steppe allies raided Poland and Russia and sold the captives to the Turks at Kaffa.

===Before 1735===
In 1722, Russia and Turkey took advantage of Persian weakness to capture the northwest part of the Persian Empire. Russia took the west side of the Caspian and the Ottomans got as far as Tabriz. Nader Shah slowly restored Persian power. By 1734, Persia was reconquering its land south of the Caucasus, and it was clear that Russia could not hold its gains. In 1733 or 1734, the Turks ordered Crimea to send a force across the north Caucasus to attack the Persians. Eropkin on the Terek river tried to stop them and lost 55 men. The army went down the west shore of the Caspian as far as the Samur River, where it was recalled by Turkey for unexplained reasons.

===1735: War starts===
In 1735, the Crimean khan led 80,000 men across the North Caucasus and south to Derbent. By the end of 1735, he received news of Leontev’s raid on Crimea and decided to turn back. During his return journey, he spent time foraging in Kabardia and eventually reached Crimea in the spring of 1736. Crimean interference in the Caucasus served as one pretext for the war.

In March 1735, through the Treaty of Ganja, Russia returned its territorial gains to Persia and forged an alliance with Persia against Turkey. With Crimean troops absent from the peninsula and the Turks engaged with Persia, Russia seized the opportunity for a surprise attack. General Münnich moved south and discovered that his army would not be ready until the following year. In order not to waste that year&#x27;s campaigning season, he dispatched Leontev on a raid.

1735: Leontev&#x27;s raid Leontev set off on 1 October 1735, far too late in the season. He started near the Samara River and marched south, east of the Dnieper bend. At Konska Voda, he killed about 1,000 Nogais and stole their livestock. He turned west with the river, and on 16 October, reached the Russian fort of Kamenny Zaton, about 10 days&#x27; march from Perekop. Here, he turned back because of the cold and the loss of 3,000 horses. The next day, a snowstorm killed another 1,000 horses. By late November, he was back where he started, having lost 9,000 of his 40,000 men and about 9,000 horses.

===1736: 1st Crimea, Azov, Kinburn===
1736: Azov captured: Around 30 March 1736, Münnich and 5,000 men besieged Azov. Additional soldiers arrived, and on 7 April, Münnich left to join the main force on the Dnieper. In May Peter Lacy took over and on 26 June the Turks surrendered on condition of safe passage. Lacy set off for Crimea, but turned back when he heard of Münnich&#x27;s withdrawal.

1736: First Russian invasion of Crimea: In mid-April, Münnich set off south with 54,000 men and 8,000 or 9,000 carts, following Leontiev’s route east of the Dnieper bend. On 4 May, the Tatars were defeated at the Bela Zirka river near Kamenny Zaton and withdrew to Perekop. By 19 May, Russia had 30,000 troops facing Perekop. On 20 May, the wall was breached, and on 22 May, the 2,254 Turks in the Or Qapi fort surrendered on parole.

Russia now entered Crimea for the first time. On 5 June, they raided Gozleve for supplies. On 17 June, they captured Bakhchisarai. The khan’s palace was burned, either accidentally or deliberately. On 23 June, they burned the kalga’s seat at Ak Mechet. Most of the Crimean army had scattered to the hills, while the Turks withdrew to Kaffa. Münnich hoped to capture Kaffa before the Turks could send reinforcements, but on 25 June, he decided to withdraw. Dysentery had first been noted on 7 June. Soon, a third of the army was sick, and many of the rest weakened. There was not enough food, fresh water, or fodder to support his army. By 18 July, they were back on the Samara river. Half of the army had been lost, 2,000 in fighting, and the rest from disease. Because of the invasion, Crimean khan Qaplan I Giray was replaced by Fetih II Giray.

1736: Kinburn captured: After Perekop was captured, Leontev and 13,000 men were sent west to capture the fort on the Kinburn Peninsula, south of Ochakov. The garrison was allowed to abandon the fort and cross to Ochakov on the opposite bank. 250 Russian prisoners were freed there.

===1737: 2nd Crimea, Ochakov===
On 9 January 1737, Austria joined the war drawing Turkish troops away from the Black Sea. The Turko-Persian conflict had ended in September 1736, but it took time to move Turkish troops west. The plan for 1737 involved one army capturing the Turkish fort of Ochakov at the mouth of the Dnieper-Bug estuary, while a second army invaded Crimea.

1737:Capture of Ochakov: In early April, Münnich left the Kiev area with about 70,000 men. On 30 June, they reached Ochakov, which now had 20,000 defenders. Fighting began the next day, and on 3 July, heated shot set the town on fire. The fire spread to the powder magazine, which blew up, killing thousands of Turks. This caused the Turks to surrender the same day.

Münnich left 8,000 men to hold the fort and returned with the rest of the army to Poltava. In October, the Ottomans tried to retake the fort under the direct orders of Sultan Mahmut I. All of their attempts failed, and on 30 October, they withdrew. (Next spring, the plague appeared in the fort and was reported in Moldavia, Wallachia, Poland, and Zaporozhia. It increased, and in September 1738, Ochakov and Kinburn were evacuated to escape the plague because the weakened troops would not be able to resist if the Turks came back.)
1737: Second invasion of Crimea: The goal was to prevent the Crimeans from supporting Ochakov, damage Crimea as much as possible, and capture the Turkish fort of Kaffa if possible. On 3 May 1737, Peter Lacy set out from the Mius River near Taganrog, about 50 km west of Azov. Around 320 small boats with supplies and Don Cossacks followed along the coast. On 23 May, the two forces joined at what is now Mariupol, about 100 km further west. On 28 June, a Turkish fleet caught the Azov flotilla near Henichesk. After two gun duels, they were driven off (1 July). Soon after, a storm destroyed most of the flotilla along with its food and ammunition.

Instead of attacking the 60,000 Tatars waiting at Perekop, Lacy built a pontoon bridge out of water casks and crossed the Henichesk Strait onto the Arabat Spit, starting on 2 July. Khan Fetih headed south toward the far end of the spit, but Lacy again outflanked him by crossing to the mainland near the Salhyr River, causing the Crimeans to disperse. Lacy went southwest, and on 14 July, he burned Karasubazar. Three days later, he chose to withdraw. He had lost most of his supplies with the flotilla; the Tatars were regrouping, there was not enough fresh water and fodder, and sickness was starting to appear. On 23 July, he crossed the Henichesk Strait, and a month later reached &quot;Molochnye Vody&quot;. Because of the invasion, the Turks replaced Khan Fetih II with Meñli II Giray.

===1738: 3rd Crimea, western campaign===
Planning started in November 1737. The goal for 1738 was to tie down the Crimeans while Münnich attacked along the Dniester in support of the Austrians.

1738: Third invasion of Crimea: Peter Lacy started from Vol&#x27;chye Vody (location?) with an army about the same size as the previous year. On 19 May, he met the supply fleet at what is now Berdiansk on the Azov coast (see Azov fleet below). Lacy learned that Mengli and 30,000 men were waiting behind Perekop, and that Turkish troops had garrisoned Or Kapi. They rested at Molochnye Vody. Instead of attacking Perekop, Lacy chose to cross the Syvash by wading at low tide, possibly near the Chongar Strait. They turned west and got between Perekop and the khan’s army. They blasted Or Kapi with mortars, which surrendered around the beginning of July. They turned south, but on 6 July, they decided to go home. There was little food or fodder because the Crimean interior had been trashed the previous year, supplies with the Azov fleet had been lost (see Azov fleet below), and disease was beginning to appear. They stopped a Tatar attack on 9 July, rested at Perekop for a month, ruined Perekop as much as they could, and returned to Molochnye Vody.

Azov fleet: Peter Bredal with a rebuilt Azov fleet, supplies, and 4,000 Don Cossacks, met Lacy’s army on 19 May. On 23 May, more Don Cossacks arrived with their own boats. On 25 May, Bredal was caught by a much larger Turkish fleet and blockaded at ‘Cape Vissarion’ (location?). The blockade was broken when the Turks unwisely pursued three escaping sloops. On 6 June, they were again caught at ‘Cape Fedotov’, probably on the long sand spit just east of Henichesk Strait. They hauled their boats across the sand spit and reassembled near Henichesk, where they were again caught on 16 June. They landed their guns, built a shore battery, and burned their boats. There was a two-day artillery duel, but the Turks chose not to land, perhaps because they lacked marines. The loss of the supply fleet forced Lacy to withdraw from Crimea.

1738: Western campaign: The goal was for Münnich to lead the main army to the Dniester and attack the border forts at either Khotin or Bender. On 17 April, he crossed the Dnieper south of Poltava, and in late June, he crossed the Bug. He reached the Dniester, but on 6 August, he abandoned the campaign because of Turkish resistance and reports of plague west of the river.

===1739: 4th Crimea fails, western campaign, war ends===
1739: Failed invasion of Crimea: Levashev was supposed to march from Azov, but an epidemic forced him to halt at the Miuss River. He later returned to Azov because a fire had destroyed the Azov arsenal and granary. Bredal could not sail from Azov due to disease and a shortage of ships. Lacy left Izium on 10 May. His force was weakened because much had been transferred to the western campaign. In July, he learned that the Turks had sent troops and a fleet, and that Levashev had turned back. He marched toward Perekop, saw that there was no hope, and returned to the Ukrainian line, which he reached on 24 August.

1739: Western campaign: Münnich planned to capture Khotin to take pressure off the Austrians, who were doing poorly. He left Kiev in late April, crossing Polish territory because the land was better and the Poles were too weak to interfere. He won the Battle of Stavuchany on 28 August, took Khotin on 30 August, and entered Jassy on 14 September. There he learned that Austria had signed a preliminary peace treaty on 1 September, and the final peace treaty on 18 September, which made his position untenable. In October, he was ordered to return to Russian territory.

1739: Treaties: The war was ended by the Treaty of Belgrade with Austria on 18 September and the Treaty of Niš with Russia on 3 October. All three parties wanted out because the war as it was costing more than anything they might gain. Russia was also worried about the looming Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743). Russia kept nothing more than a demilitarized Azov and Zaporozhye, but it had demonstrated that it could reach Moldavia and was now a serious threat to Crimea. After the formal ratification of peace treaties, diplomatic instruments were exchanged and the final convention was signed in Constantinople on 28 December 1739, also trough the French mediation, thus concluding the war.

===Note on the Austro-Turkish war===
Austria hoped to gain land in the Balkans while the Turks were tied down with Russia. The border was then about 100 km south of Belgrade in land gained in 1717. In 1737, Austria went south, captured Niš but soon gave it up. In 1738, the Turks advanced and took places in central Serbia and on the Danube. In 1739, Austria crossed the Danube, fought a battle at Grocka, and fell back to the Danube. Belgrade was under siege by the Turks when talks began. Austria gave up Belgrade with central Serbia, south of the Danube, and also western Wallachia, which was perhaps more than the military situation required. The war was poorly managed. The next year, the War of the Austrian Succession began.

<text>Crimean Tatars () or Crimeans () are an East European Turkic ethnic group and nation indigenous to Crimea. The formation and ethnogenesis of Crimean Tatars lasted thousands of years in Crimea and the Northern Black Sea region, uniting Mediterranean populations with those of the Eurasian Steppe. Genome-wide study of the Crimean Tatars unveiled connections between them and the genomes of individuals from the Bronze Age steppes of Eurasia, specifically those associated with the Yamnaya archaeological culture.

Crimean Tatars constituted the majority of Crimea&#x27;s population from the time of ethnogenesis until the mid-19th century, and the largest ethnic population until the end of the 19th century. Russia attempted to purge Crimean Tatars through a combination of physical violence, intimidation, forced resettlement, and legalized forms of discrimination between 1783 and 1900. From Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea in 1783 to 1800, between 100,000 and 300,000 Crimean Tatars emigrated.

While Crimean Tatar cultural elements were not completely eradicated under the Romanov dynasty, the Crimean Tatars were almost completely driven from the Crimean peninsula under the Soviets. Almost immediately after retaking of Crimea from Axis forces, in May 1944, the USSR State Defense Committee ordered the deportation of all of the Crimean Tatars from Crimea, including the families of Crimean Tatars who had served in the Soviet Army. The deportees were transported in trains and boxcars to Central Asia, primarily to Uzbekistan. The Crimean Tatars lost 18–46 percent of their population as a result of the deportations. Starting in 1967, a few were allowed to return and in 1989 the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union condemned the removal of Crimean Tatars from their motherland as inhumane and lawless, but only a tiny percent were able to return before the full right of return became policy in 1989. 

The Crimean Tatars have been members of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 1991. The European Union and international indigenous groups do not dispute their status as an indigenous people and they have been officially recognized as an indigenous people of Ukraine as of 2014. The current Russian administration considers them a &quot;national minority&quot;, but not an indigenous people, and continues to deny that they are titular people of Crimea, even though the Soviet Union considered them indigenous before their deportation and the subsequent dissolution of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Crimean ASSR). Today, Crimean Tatars constitute approximately 15% of the population of Crimea. A Crimean Tatar diaspora remains in Turkey and Uzbekistan.

==Language==
The Crimean Tatar language is a member of Kipchak languages of the Turkic language family. It has three dialects and the standard language is written in the central dialect. Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages because its three &quot;dialects&quot; belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult.

UNESCO ranked Crimean Tatar as one of the most endangered languages that are under serious threat of extinction (&quot;severely endangered&quot;) in 2010. However, according to the Institute of Oriental Studies, due to negative situations, the real degree of threat has elevated to critically endangered languages in recent years, which are highly likely to face extinction in the coming generations.

* Noğay, (çöl &quot;desert&quot;, şimaliy &quot;northern&quot;): Noğay is spoken by the vast majority of diaspora Crimean Tatars in Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and others. It belongs to Bulgar subgrouping of the Kipchak family and Nogai, another Kipchak language, has influenced it. It is related to Kazakh, Karakalpak, and Nogai proper. This dialect was spoken by former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean steppes. It has roots in Cumania and later the Golden Horde. It was influenced by the Middle Mongol spoken in the Golden Horde and notable Slavic influences occurred during the Imperial Russian invasion in 1783.
* Bağçasaray (orta yolaq &quot;middle region&quot;): Standard Crimean Tatar is classified as a language of the Cuman subgroup of Kipchak and the closest relatives are Karachay-Balkar, Karaim, and Urum. Bağçasaray is spoken in Crimea by sedentary Tatars as the standard language because its speakers comprise a relative majority of Crimean Tartar speakers in Crimea. The middle dialect, although it is a Kipchak language, has strong Turkish, Ukrainian, Mariupol Greek (especially Urum language) elements.
* Yalıboyu (cenübiy &quot;Southern&quot;): The Yalıboyu, Tat-Tarter, or Coastal Tatar language is an Oghuz language descended from Ottoman Turkish. It arrived in Crimea through the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s conquest of the Principality of Theodoro in 1475. Following the Turkish occupation, Southern Crimea came under direct Ottoman Turkish rule, while the Crimean Khanate in northern regions was vassalized. The language has possible Crimean Gothic and some Italian and Greek influences due to trade routes.

==Sub-ethnic groups==

The Crimean Tatars are most often subdivided into three core sub-ethnic groups:

* The &quot;Mountain Tats&quot; (not to be confused with the Iranic Tat people, living in the Caucasus region) who used to inhabit the mountainous Crimea before 1944 predominantly are Cumans, Greeks, Goths and other people, as Tats in Crimea also were called Hellenic Urum people (Greeks settled in Crimea) who were deported by the Imperial Russia to the area around Mariupol; The term &quot;Tat&quot; appears already in the 8th century Orkhon inscriptions denoting &quot;a subjected foreign people&quot;. In the 17th century Crimean context, it probably denoted various peoples of foreign (ie. non-Turkic) origin living under the khan&#x27;s rule, especially the Greeks, Italians, and the remnants of Goths and Alans inhabiting the mountainous southern section of Crimea.
* The &quot;Yaliboylu Tats&quot; composed of Tatarized descendants of peoples who lived on the Southern Coast of the peninsula before 1944 and practiced Christianity until the 14th century;
* The &quot;Noğay Tatars&quot; (not to be confused with related Nogai people, living now in Southern Russia) — former inhabitants of the Crimean steppe.

There are also three other groups that are closely related to Crimean Tatars and sometimes are considered as sub-ethnic groups:
* The &quot;Tajfa&quot; who are Roma Muslims assimilated into the Crimean Tatar people, speak a Crimean Tatar dialect, and typically consider themselves to be Crimean Tatar first and Roma as a secondary identity.
* The Urum: A group of Turkic-speaking Greek Orthodox people native to Crimea, who have assimilated over time. They are closely related to the Ukrainian Greeks and are traditionally believed to be descendants of ancient Crimean Greeks who later had direct contact with the Crimean Khanate.
* The Lipka Tatars. Part of the Lipka Tatars, who came from the Crimean Khanate, are considered part of the Crimean Tatars. They played a significant role in the Crimean Tatar national movement during the First and Second World Wars (Maciej Sulkiewicz, Mustafa Edige Kirimal, Olgerd Krychynsky). Famous scientists and writers with a world name come from Lipka Tatars (Henryk Sienkiewicz, Ahatanhel Krymsky and Mykhailo Tugan-Baranovsky). Most of them do not know the Crimean Tatar language due to assimilation and speak Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian and Ukrainian.

Historians suggest that inhabitants of the mountainous parts of Crimea lying to the central and southern parts (the Tats), and those of the Southern coast of Crimea (the Yalıboyu) were the direct descendants of the Pontic Greeks, Scythians, Ostrogoths (Crimean Goths), and Kipchaks along with the Cumans while the latest inhabitants of the northern steppe represent the descendants of the Nogai Horde of the Black Sea, nominally subjects of the Crimean Khan. It is largely assumed that the Tatarization process that mostly took place in the 16th century brought a sense of cultural unity through the blending of the Greeks, Italians, Ottoman Turks of the southern coast, Goths of the central mountains and Turkic-speaking Kipchaks and Cumans of the steppe and forming of the Crimean Tatar ethnic group. However, the Cuman language is considered the direct ancestor of the current language of the Crimean Tatars with possible incorporations of the other languages, like Crimean Gothic. The fact that Crimean Tatars&#x27; ethnogenesis took place in Crimea and consisted of several stages lasting thousands of years is proved by genetic research showing that the gene pool of the Crimean Tatars preserved both the initial components for thousands of years, and later in the northern steppe regions of the Crimea.

The Mongol conquest of the Kipchaks led to a merged society with a Mongol ruling class over a Kipchak speaking population which came to be dubbed Tatar and which eventually absorbed other ethnicities on the Crimean peninsula like Italians, Greeks, and Goths to form the modern day Crimean Tatar people; up to the Soviet deportation, the Crimean Tatars could still differentiate among themselves between Tatar, Kipchak, Nogays, and the &quot;Tat&quot; descendants of Tatarized Goths and other Turkified peoples.

== Genetics ==
The genetic composition of the Crimean Tatars is distinguished by the presence of two predominant patterns: the so-called &quot;sea pattern&quot; and the &quot;steppe pattern&quot;. The former is believed to have originated from Mediterranean populations, while the latter is attributed to the nomadic tribes of the Great Eurasian steppe. The primary contributor to the &quot;sea pattern&quot; of the Crimean Tatars is not the later migrations of Greeks from the Byzantine Empire, but rather the ancient populations from the city-states of the Eastern Mediterranean dating back to the 7th to 5th centuries BC. This assertion is further substantiated by the analysis of the Crimean Tatar gene pool as revealed by the &quot;Human Origins&quot; full-genome panel data. Geneticists have concluded that the Crimean Tatars, as a distinct ethnic group, were formed directly within Crimea, rather than migrating to the region, thereby affirming their status as the indigenous inhabitants of Crimea. 

Contrary to hypotheses suggesting that the gene pool of the Crimean Tatars was significantly influenced by Central Asian populations or Mongolic groups, genetic research indicates a considerable divergence from both, with the Balkars, a highland ethnic group from the Caucasus, being most genetically akin to the Crimean Tatars. Furthermore, the hypothesis positing a substantial impact of Slavic populations on the genetic makeup of the Crimean Tatars is also refuted by genetic studies, which reveal no significant influx of &quot;Slavic&quot; genetic material into the Crimean Tatar gene pool despite prolonged proximity.

Vavilov Institute of General Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, focused on three specific haplogroups — G1, N3, and R1b — unveiled connections between the Crimean Tatars and the genomes of individuals from the Bronze Age steppes of Eurasia, specifically those associated with the Yamnaya archaeological culture, and the &quot;European&quot; (N3a3) and &quot;Asian&quot; (N3a5) Neolithic variants of haplogroup N3 in Northern Eurasia. These findings may reflect not only the genetic legacy of the Scythians and Sarmatians but also more ancient affiliations between the populations of mainland Eastern Europe and the Crimean Peninsula.

The genetic composition of the Crimean Tatars is primarily constituted by five predominant haplogroups: R1a, R1b, J2, G2a3b1 and E1b1b1, which together account for 67% of the genetic diversity, whereas other haplogroups are classified as minor, each contributing between 1% and 5% to the overall genetic makeup of the Crimean Tatars.
==History==
===Origin===

The Crimean Tatars were formed as a people in Crimea and are descendants of various peoples who lived in Crimea in different historical eras. The main ethnic groups that inhabited the Crimea at various times and took part in the formation of the Crimean Tatar people are Tauri, Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, Ancient Greeks, Crimean Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Khazars, Pechenegs, Cumans, Italians. The consolidation of this diverse ethnic conglomerate into a single Crimean Tatar people took place over the course of centuries. The connecting elements in this process were the commonality of the territory, the Turkic language and Islamic religion.

By the end of the 15th century, the main prerequisites that led to the formation of an independent Crimean Tatar ethnic group were created: the political dominance of the Crimean Khanate was established in Crimea, the Turkic languages (Cuman-Kipchak on the territory of the khanate) became dominant, and Islam acquired the status of a state religion throughout the Peninsula. By a preponderance Cumanian population of the Crimea acquired the name &quot;Tatars&quot;, the Islamic religion and Turkic language, and the process of consolidating the multi-ethnic conglomerate of the Peninsula began, which has led to the emergence of the Crimean Tatar people. Over several centuries, on the basis of Cuman language with a noticeable Oghuz influence, the Crimean Tatar language has developed.

===In the Golden Horde===

At the beginning of the 13th century in the Crimea, the majority of the population, which was already composed of a Turkic people — Cumans, became a part of the Golden Horde. The Crimean Tatars mostly adopted Islam in the 14th century and thereafter Crimea became one of the centers of Islamic civilization in Eastern Europe. In the same century, trends towards separatism appeared in the Crimean Ulus of the Golden Horde. De facto independence of the Crimea from the Golden Horde may be counted since the beginning of princess (khanum) Canike&#x27;s, the daughter of the powerful Khan of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh and the wife of the founder of the Nogai Horde Edigey, reign in the peninsula. During her reign she strongly supported Hacı Giray in the struggle for the Crimean throne until her death in 1437. Following the death of Canike, the situation of Hacı Giray in Crimea weakened and he was forced to leave Crimea for Lithuania.

The Crimean Tatars emerged as a nation at the time of the Crimean Khanate, an Ottoman vassal state during the 16th to 18th centuries. Russian historian, doctor of history, Professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences Ilya Zaytsev writes that analysis of historical data shows that the influence of Turkey on the policy of the Crimea was not as high as it was reported in old Turkish sources and Imperial Russian ones. The Turkic-speaking population of Crimea had mostly adopted Islam already in the 14th century, following the conversion of Ozbeg Khan of the Golden Horde. By the time of the first Russian invasion of Crimea in 1736, the Khan&#x27;s archives and libraries were famous throughout the Islamic world, and under Khan Krym-Girei the city of Aqmescit was endowed with piped water, sewerage and a theatre where Molière was performed in French, while the port of Kezlev stood comparison with Rotterdam and Bakhchysarai, the capital, was described as Europe&#x27;s cleanest and greenest city.

===In the Crimean Khanate===

In 1441, an embassy from the representatives of several strongest clans of the Crimea, including the Golden Horde clans Shırın and Barın and the Cumanic clan — Kıpçak, went to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to invite Hacı Giray to rule in the Crimea. He became the founder of the Giray dynasty, which ruled until the annexation of the Crimean Khanate by Russia in 1783. Hacı I Giray was a Jochid descendant of Genghis Khan and of his grandson Batu Khan of the Golden Horde. During the reign of Meñli I Giray, Hacı&#x27;s son, the army of the Great Horde that still existed then invaded the Crimea from the north, Crimean Khan won the general battle, overtaking the army of the Horde Khan in Takht-Lia, where he was killed, the Horde ceased to exist, and the Crimean Khan became the Great Khan and the successor of this state. Since then, the Crimean Khanate was among the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the beginning of the 18th century. The Khanate officially operated as a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, with great autonomy after 1580. At the same time, the Nogai hordes, not having their own khan, were vassals of the Crimean one, Muskovy and Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth paid annual tribute to the khan (until 1700 and 1699 respectively). In the 17th century, the Crimean Tatars helped Ukrainian Cossacks led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky in the struggle for independence, which allowed them to win several decisive victories over Polish troops.

In 1711, when Peter I of Russia went on a campaign with all his troops (80,000) to gain access to the Black Sea, he was surrounded by the army of the Crimean Khan Devlet II Giray, finding himself in a hopeless situation. And only the betrayal of the Ottoman vizier Baltacı Mehmet Pasha allowed Peter to get out of the encirclement of the Crimean Tatars. When Devlet II Giray protested against the vizier&#x27;s decision, his response was: &quot;You should know your Tatar affairs. The affairs of the Sublime Porte are entrusted to me. You do not have the right to interfere in them&quot;. Treaty of the Pruth was signed, and 10 years later, Russia declared itself an empire. In 1736, the Crimean Khan Qaplan I Giray was summoned by the Turkish Sultan Ahmed III to Persia. Understanding that Russia could take advantage of the lack of troops in Crimea, Qaplan Giray wrote to the Sultan to think twice, but the Sultan was persistent. As it was expected by Qaplan Giray, in 1736 the Russian army invaded the Crimea, led by Münnich, devastated the peninsula, killed civilians and destroyed all major cities, occupied the capital, Bakhchisaray, and burnt the Khan&#x27;s palace with all the archives and documents, and then left the Crimea because of the epidemic that had begun in it. One year after the same was done by another Russian general — Peter Lacy. Since then, the Crimean Khanate had not been able to recover, and its slow decline began. The Russo-Turkish War of 1768 to 1774 resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and the Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate. After a period of political unrest in Crimea, Imperial Russia violated the treaty and annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783.

The main population of the Crimean khanate were Crimean Tatars, along with them in the Crimean khanate lived significant communities of Karaites, Italians, Armenians, Greeks, Circassians and Roma. In the early 16th century under the rule of the Crimean khans passed part of Nogays (Mangyts), who roamed outside the Crimean Peninsula, moving there during periods of drought and starvation. The majority of the population professed Islam of the Hanafi stream; part of the population – Orthodox, Monotheletism, Judaism; in the 16th century. There were small Catholic communities. The Crimean Tatar population of the Crimean Peninsula was partially exempt from taxes. The Greeks paid dzhyziya, the Italians were in a privileged position due to the partial tax relief made during the reign of Meñli Geray I. By the 18th century the population of the Crimean khanate was about 500 thousand people. The territory of the Crimean khanate was divided into Kinakanta (governorships), which consisted of Kadylyk, covering a number of settlements.

===Nogay slave trade (15th–18th centuries)===

Until the beginning of the 18th century, the Crimean Nogays were known for frequent, at some periods almost annual, slave raids into present-day &#x27;mainland&#x27; Ukraine and Russia. For a long time, until the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East which was one of the important factors of its economy. One of the most important trading ports and slave markets was Kefe. According to the Ottoman census of 1526, taxes on the sale and purchase of slaves accounted for 24% of the funds, levied in Ottoman Crimea for all activities. But in fact, there were always small raids committed by both Tatars and Cossacks, in both directions. The 17th century Ottoman writer and traveller Evliya Çelebi wrote that there were 920,000 Ukrainian slaves in the Crimea but only 187,000 free Muslims. However, the Ukrainian historian Sergey Gromenko considers this testimony of Çelebi a myth popular among ultranationalists, pointing out that today it is known from the writings on economics that in the 17th century, the Crimea could feed no more than 500 thousand people. For comparison, according to the notes of the Consul of France to Qırım Giray khan Baron Totta, a hundred years later, in 1767, there were 4 million people living in the Crimean khanate, and in 1778, that is, just eleven years later, all the Christians were evicted from its territory by the Russian authorities, which turned out to be about 30 thousand, mostly Armenians and Greeks, and there were no Ukrainians among them. Also, according to more reliable modern sources than Evliya&#x27;s data, slaves never constituted a significant part of the Crimean population. Russian professor Glagolev writes that there were 1.800.000 free Crimean Tatars in the Crimean Khanate in 1666, it also should be mentioned that a huge part of Ukraine was part of the Crimean Khanate, that is why Ukrainians could have been taken into account in the general population of the Khanate by Evliya (see Khan Ukraine).

Some researchers estimate that more than 2 million people were captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate. Polish historian Bohdan Baranowski assumed that in the 17th century Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania and Belarus) lost an average of 20,000 yearly and as many as one million in all years combined from 1500 to 1644. One of the most famous victims of the Tatar slave trade was a young woman from Ruthenia, captured during her wedding who came to be known as Roxelana (Hürrem Sultan), a concubine of Sultan Suleiman.

In retaliation, the lands of Crimean Tatars were being raided by Zaporozhian Cossacks, armed Ukrainian horsemen, who defended the steppe frontier – Wild Fields – against Tatar slave raids and often attacked and plundered the lands of Ottoman Turks and Crimean Tatars. The Don Cossacks and Kalmyk Mongols also managed to raid Crimean Tatars&#x27; land. The last recorded major Crimean raid, before those in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) took place during the reign of Peter the Great (1682–1725). However, Cossack raids continued after that time; Ottoman Grand Vizier complained to the Russian consul about raids to Crimea and Özi in 1761. In 1769 one last major Tatar raid, which took place during the Russo-Turkish War, saw the capture of 20,000 slaves.

Nevertheless, some historians, including Russian historian Valery Vozgrin and Polish historian Oleksa Gayvoronsky have emphasized that the role of the slave trade in the economy of the Crimean Khanate is greatly exaggerated by modern historians, and the raiding-dependent economy is nothing but a historical myth. According to modern researches, livestock occupied a leading position in the economy of the Crimean Khanate, Crimean Khanate was one of the main wheat suppliers to the Ottoman Empire. Salt mining, viticulture and winemaking, horticulture and gardening were also developed as sources of income.

Several modern historians have argued that historiography on the Crimean Tatars has been strongly influenced by Russian historians, who have rewritten the history of the Crimean Khanate to justify the annexation of Crimea in 1783, and, especially, then by Soviet historians who distorted the history of Crimea to justify the 1944 deportation of the Crimean Tatars.

===In the Russian Empire===


The Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and the Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate. After a period of political unrest in Crimea, Russia violated the treaty and annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783. After the annexation, the wealthier Tatars, who had exported wheat, meat, fish and wine to other parts of the Black Sea, began to be expelled and to move to the Ottoman Empire. Due to the oppression by the Russian administration and colonial politics of Russian Empire, the Crimean Tatars were forced to immigrate to the Ottoman Empire. Further expulsions followed in 1812 for fear of the reliability of the Tatars in the face of Napoleon&#x27;s advance. Particularly, the Crimean War of 1853–1856, the laws of 1860–63, the Tsarist policy and the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) caused an exodus of the Tatars; 12,000 boarded Allied ships in Sevastopol to escape the destruction of shelling, and were branded traitors by the Russian government. Of total Tatar population 300,000 of the Taurida Governorate about 200,000 Crimean Tatars emigrated. Many Crimean Tatars perished in the process of emigration, including those who drowned while crossing the Black Sea. In total, from 1783 till the beginning of the 20th century, at least 800 thousand Tatars left Crimea. Today the descendants of these Crimeans form the Crimean Tatar diaspora in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.

Ismail Gasprali (1851–1914) was a renowned Crimean Tatar intellectual, influenced by the nationalist movements of the period, whose efforts laid the foundation for the modernization of Muslim culture and the emergence of the Crimean Tatar national identity. The bilingual Crimean Tatar-Russian newspaper &quot;Terciman-Perevodchik&quot; he published in 1883–1914, functioned as an educational tool through which a national consciousness and modern thinking emerged among the entire Turkic-speaking population of the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 this new elite, which included Noman Çelebicihan and Cafer Seydamet Qırımer proclaimed the first democratic republic in the Islamic world, named the Crimean People&#x27;s Republic on 26 December 1917. However, this republic was short-lived and abolished by the Bolshevik uprising in January 1918.
===In the Soviet Union (1917–1991)===


As a part of the Russian famine of 1921 the Peninsula suffered widespread starvation. More than 100,000 Crimean Tatars starved to death, and tens of thousands of Tatars fled to Turkey or Romania. Thousands more were deported or killed during the collectivization in 1928–29. The Soviet government&#x27;s &quot;collectivization&quot; policies led to a major nationwide famine in 1931–33. Between 1917 and 1933, 150,000 Tatars—about 50% of the population at the time—either were killed or forced out of Crimea. During Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, statesmen and intellectuals such as Veli İbraimov and Bekir Çoban-zade were imprisoned or executed on various charges.

In May 1944, the entire Crimean Tatar population of Crimea was exiled to Central Asia, mainly to Uzbekistan, on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Chairman of the USSR State Defense Committee. Although a great number of Crimean Tatar men served in the Red Army and took part in the partisan movement in Crimea during the war, the existence of a Tatar Legion in the Nazi army and the collaboration of some Crimean Tatar religious and political leaders with Hitler during the German occupation of Crimea provided the Soviet leadership with justification for accusing the entire Crimean Tatar population of being Nazi collaborators. Some modern researchers argue that Crimea&#x27;s geopolitical position fueled Soviet perceptions of Crimean Tatars as a potential threat. This belief is based in part on an analogy with numerous other cases of deportations of non-Russians from boundary territories, as well as the fact that other non-Russian populations, such as Greeks, Armenians and Bulgarians were also removed from Crimea (see Deportation of the peoples inhabiting Crimea). 

All 240,000 Crimean Tatars were deported &quot;en masse&quot;, in a form of collective punishment, on 17–18 May 1944 as &quot;special settlers&quot; to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and other distant parts of the Soviet Union. This event is called Sürgün in the Crimean Tatar language; the few who escaped were shot on sight or drowned in scuttled barges, and within months half their number had died of cold, hunger, exhaustion and disease. Many of them were re-located to toil as forced labourers in the Soviet Gulag system.

====Civil rights movement====
Starting in 1944, Crimean Tatars lived mostly in Central Asia with the designation as &quot;special settlers&quot;, meaning that they had few rights. &quot;Special settlers&quot; were forbidden from leaving small designated areas and had to frequently sign in at a commandant&#x27;s office. Soviet propaganda directed towards Uzbeks depicted Crimean Tatars as threats to their homeland, and as a result there were many documented hate crimes against Crimean-Tatar civilians by Uzbek Communist loyalists. In the 1950s the &quot;special settler&quot; regime ended, but Crimean Tatars were still kept closely tethered to Central Asia; while other deported ethnic groups like the Chechens, Karachays, and Kalmyks were fully allowed to return to their native lands during the Khrushchev thaw, economic and political reasons combined with basic misconceptions and stereotypes about Crimean Tatars led to Moscow and Tashkent being reluctant to allow Crimean Tatars the same right of return; the same decree that rehabilitated other deported nations and restored their national republics urged Crimean Tatars who wanted a national republic to seek &quot;national reunification&quot; in the Tatar ASSR in lieu of restoration of the Crimean ASSR, much to the dismay of Crimean Tatars who bore no connection to or desire to &quot;return&quot; to Tatarstan. Moscow&#x27;s refusal to allow a return was not only based on a desire to satisfy the new Russian settlers in Crimea, who were very hostile to the idea of a return and had been subject to lots of Tatarophobic propaganda, but for economic reasons: high productivity from Crimean Tatar workers in Central Asia meant that letting the diaspora return would take a toll on Soviet industrialization goals in Central Asia. Historians have long suspected that violent resistance to confinement in exile from Chechens led to further willingness to let them return, while the non-violent Crimean Tatar movement did not lead to any desire for Crimean Tatars to leave Central Asia. In effect, the government was punishing Crimean Tatars for being Stakhanovites while rewarding the deported nations that contributed less to the building of socialism, creating further resentment.

A 1967 Soviet decree removed the charges against Crimean Tatars on paper while simultaneously referring to them not by their proper ethnonym but by the euphemism that eventually became standard of &quot;citizens of Tatar nationality who formerly lived in Crimea&quot;, angering many Crimean Tatars who realized it meant they were not even seen as Crimean Tatars by the government. In addition, the Soviet government did nothing to facilitate their resettlement in Crimea and to make reparations for lost lives and confiscated property. Before the mass return in the perestroika era, Crimean Tatars made up only 1.5% of Crimea&#x27;s population, since government entities at all levels took a variety of measures beyond the already-debilitating residence permit system to keep them in Central Asia.

The abolition of the special settlement regime made it possible for Crimean Tatar rights activists to mobilize. The primary method of raising grievances with the government was petitioning. Many for the right of return gained over 100,000 signatures; although other methods of protest were occasionally used, the movement remained completely non-violent. When only a small percentage of Crimean Tatars were allowed to return to Crimea, those who were not granted residence permits would return to Crimea and try to live under the radar. However, the lack of a residence permit resulted in a second deportation for them. A last-resort method to avoid a second deportation was self-immolation, famously used by Crimean Tatar national hero Musa Mamut, one of those who moved to Crimea without a residence permit. He doused himself with gasoline and committed self-immolation in front of police trying to deport him on 23 June 1978. Mamut died of severe burns several days later, but expressed no regret for having committed self-immolation. Mamut posthumously became a symbol of Crimean Tatar resistance and nationhood, and remains celebrated by Crimean Tatars. Other notable self-immolations in the name of the Crimean Tatar right of return movement include that of Shavkat Yarullin, who fatally committed self-immolation in front of a government building in protest in October 1989, and Seidamet Balji who attempted self-immolation while being deported from Crimea in December that year but survived. Many other famous Crimean Tatars threatened government authorities with self-immolation if they continued to be ignored, including Hero of the Soviet Union Abdraim Reshidov. In the later years of the Soviet Union, Crimean Tatar activists held picket protests in Red Square.

After a prolonged effort of lobbying by the Crimean Tatar civil rights movement, the Soviet government established a commission in 1987 to evaluate the request for the right of return, chaired by Andrey Gromyko. Gromyko&#x27;s condescending attitude and failure to assure them that they would have the right of return ended up concerning members of the Crimean Tatar civil rights movement. In June 1988 he issued an official statement that rejected the request for re-establishment of a Crimean Tatar autonomy in Crimea and supported only allowing an organized return of a few more Crimean Tatars, while agreeing to allow the lower-priority requests of having more publications and school instruction in the Crimean Tatar language at the local level among areas with the deported populations. The conclusion that &quot;no basis to renew autonomy and grant Crimean Tatars the right to return&quot; triggered widespread protests. Less than two years after Gromyko&#x27;s commission had rejected their request for autonomy and return, pogroms against the deported Meskhetian Turks were taking place in Central Asia. During the pogroms, some Crimean Tatars were targeted as well, resulting in changing attitudes towards allowing Crimean Tatars to move back to Crimea. Eventually a second commission, chaired by Gennady Yanaev and inclusive of Crimean Tatars on the board, was established in 1989 to reevaluate the issue, and it was decided that the deportation was illegal and the Crimean Tatars were granted the full right to return, revoking previous laws intended to make it as difficult as possible for Crimean Tatars to move to Crimea.

===In independent Ukraine (1991–2014)===

Today, more than 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to their homeland, struggling to re-establish their lives and reclaim their national and cultural rights against many social and economic obstacles. One-third of them are atheists, and over half that consider themselves religious are non-observant. As of 2009, only 15 out of 650 schools in Crimea provided education in the Crimean Tatar language, and 13 of them only do so in the first three grades.

Squatting in Crimea has been a significant method for Crimean Tatars to rebuild communities in Crimea destroyed by the deportations. These squats have sometimes resulted in violence by Crimean Russians, such as the 1992 Krasny Ray events, in which the security forces of the separatist Republic of Crimea (not to be confused with the post-2014 government of the same name) attacked a Crimean Tatar squat near the village of Krasny Ray. As a result of the attack on the Krasny Ray settlement, Crimean Tatars stormed the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea, leading to the release of 26 squatters who had been abducted by the Crimean security forces.

Crimean Tatars were recognised as an indigenous people by the 1996 Constitution of Ukraine, and granted a limited number of seats in the 1994 Crimean parliamentary election. Nonetheless, they faced constant discrimination from the authorities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which was primarily governed by ethnic Russians and directed towards Russian interests. Under the presidency of Viktor Yushchenko, increased attention was paid to Crimean Tatars, with trials for crimes against humanity beginning for those involved in the deportations. However, issues of land failed to be resolved.

===2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation===


Following news of Crimea&#x27;s independence referendum organized with the help of Russia on 16 March 2014, the Kurultai leadership voiced concerns of renewed persecution, as commented by a U.S. official before the visit of a UN human rights team to the peninsula. At the same time, Rustam Minnikhanov, the president of Tatarstan was dispatched to Crimea to quell Crimean Tatars&#x27; concerns and to state that &quot;in the 23 years of Ukraine&#x27;s independence the Ukrainian leaders have been using Crimean Tatars as pawns in their political games without doing them any tangible favors&quot;. The issue of Crimean Tatar persecution by Russia has since been raised regularly on an international level.

On 18 March 2014, the day Crimea was annexed by Russia, and Crimean Tatar was &quot;de jure&quot; declared one of the three official languages of Crimea. It was also announced that Crimean Tatars will be required to relinquish coastal lands on which they squatted since their return to Crimea in the early 1990s and be given land elsewhere in Crimea. Crimea stated it needed the relinquished land for &quot;social purposes&quot;, since part of this land is occupied by the Crimean Tatars without legal documents of ownership. The situation was caused by the inability of the USSR (and later Ukraine) to sell the land to Crimean Tatars at a reasonable price instead of giving back to the Tatars the land owned before deportation, once they or their descendants returned from Central Asia (mainly Uzbekistan). As a consequence, some Crimean Tatars settled as squatters, occupying land that was and is still not legally registered.

Some Crimean Tatars fled to Mainland Ukraine due to the annexation of Crimea – reportedly around 2,000 by 23 March. On 29 March 2014, an emergency meeting of the Crimean Tatars representative body, the Kurultai, voted in favor of seeking &quot;ethnic and territorial autonomy&quot; for Crimean Tatars using &quot;political and legal&quot; means. The meeting was attended by the Head of the Republic of Tatarstan and the chair of the Russian Council of Muftis. Decisions as to whether the Tatars will accept Russian passports or whether the autonomy sought would be within the Russian or Ukrainian state have been deferred pending further discussion. , the Mejlis worked in emergency mode in Kyiv.

After the annexation of Crimea by Russian Federation, Crimean Tatars were persecuted and discriminated by Russian authorities, including cases of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances by Russian security forces and courts. 

On 12 June 2018, Ukraine lodged a memorandum consisting of 17,500 pages of text in 29 volumes to the UN&#x27;s International Court of Justice about racial discrimination against Crimean Tatars by Russian authorities in occupied Crimea and state financing of terrorism by Russian Federation in Donbas.

In May 2024, Mustafa Dzhemilev announced that at least 41 Crimean Tatars had died fighting for Russia in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 22 of which were convicts, 13 a result of Russian mobilisation and 6 as volunteers.

==Distribution==
In the 2001 Ukrainian census, 248,200 Ukrainian citizens identified themselves as Crimean Tatars with 98% (or about 243,400) of them living in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. An additional 1,800 (or about 0.7%) lived in the city of Sevastopol, also on the Crimean peninsula, but outside the border of the autonomous republic. This territory was annexed by Russia in 2014.

About 150,000 remain in exile in Central Asia, mainly in Uzbekistan. According to Tatar activists, Eskişehir Province houses about 150,000 Crimean Tatars. Some activists set the national level figure as high as 6 million, which is considered an overestimation. Crimean Tatars in Turkey mostly live in Eskişehir Province, descendants of those who emigrated in the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. The Dobruja region of Romania and Bulgaria is home to more than 27,000 Crimean Tatars, with the majority in Romania and approximately 3,000 on the Bulgarian side of the border.

==Culture==
Yurts or nomadic tents have traditionally played an important role in the cultural history of Crimean Tatars. There are different types of yurts; some are large and collapsible, called &quot;terme&quot;, while others are small and non-collapsible (otav).

Two types of alphabet are in use: Cyrillic and Latin. Initially Crimean Tatars used Arabic script. In 1928, it was replaced with the Latin alphabet. Cyrillic was introduced in 1938 based on the Russian alphabet. The Cyrillic alphabet was the only official one between 1938 and 1997. All its letters coincide with those of the Russian alphabet. The 1990s saw the start of the gradual transition of the language to the new Latin alphabet based on the Turkish one.

The songs (makam) of the nomadic steppe Crimean Tatars are characterized by diatonic, melodic simplicity and brevity. The songs of mountainous and southern coastal Crimean Tatars, called , are sung with richly ornamented melodies. Household lyricism is also widespread. Occasionally, song competitions take place between young men and women during Crimean holidays and weddings. Ritual folklore includes winter greetings, wedding songs, lamentations and circular dance songs (khoran). Epic stories or destans are very popular among the Crimean Tatars, particularly the destans of &quot;Chora batyr&quot;, &quot;Edige&quot;, &quot;Koroglu&quot;, and others.

On the Nowruz holiday, Crimean Tatars usually cook eggs, chicken soup, puff meat pie (kobete), halva, and sweet biscuits. Children put on masks and sing special songs under the windows of their neighbours, receiving sweets in return.

The traditional cuisine of the Crimean Tatars has similarities with that of Greeks, Italians, Balkan peoples, Nogays, North Caucasians, and Volga Tatars, although some national dishes and dietary habits vary between different Crimean Tatar regional subgroups; for example, fish and produce are more popular among Yaliboylu Tatar dishes while meat and dairy is more prevalent in Steppe Tatar cuisine. Many Uzbek dishes were incorporated into Crimean Tatar national cuisine during exile in Central Asia since 1944, and these dishes have become prevalent in Crimea since the return. Uzbek samsa, laghman, and (pilaf) are sold in most Tatar roadside cafes in Crimea as national dishes. In turn, some Crimean Tatar dishes, including chibureki, have been adopted by peoples outside Crimea, such as in Turkey and the North Caucasus.

==Crimean Tatar political parties==

===National movement of Crimean Tatars===
Founded by Crimean Tatar civil rights activist Yuri Osmanov, the National Movement of Crimean Tatars (NDKT) was the major opposition faction to the Dzhemilev faction during the Soviet era. The official goal of the NDKT during the Soviet era was the restoration of the Crimean ASSR under the Leninist principle of national autonomy for titular indigenous peoples in their homeland, conflicting with the desires of an independent Tatar state from the OKND, the predecessor of the Mejilis. Yuri Osmanov, founder of the organization, was highly critical of Dzhemilev, saying that the OKND, the predecessor of the Mejilis, did not sufficiently try to mend ethnic tensions in Crimea. However, the OKND decreased in popularity after Yuri Osmanov was killed.

===Mejlis===
In 1991, the Crimean Tatar leadership founded the Kurultai, or Parliament, to act as a representative body for the Crimean Tatars which could address grievances to the Ukrainian central government, the Crimean government, and international bodies. Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People is the executive body of the Kurultai.

From the 1990s until October 2013, the political leader of the Crimean Tatars and the chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People was former Soviet dissident Mustafa Dzhemilev. Since October 2013 the chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People has been Refat Chubarov.

Following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, Russian authorities declared the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People an extremist organization, and banned it on 26 April 2016.

===New Milliy Firqa===
In 2006, a new Crimean Tatar party in opposition to the Mejlis was founded, taking the name of the previously-defunct Milly Firqa party from the early 20th century. The party claims to be successor of the ideas of Yuri Osmanov and NDKT. After the Russian annexation, the party announced its cooperation with the occupiers.

<doc id="933652" wikidata="Q295483" url="?curid=933652" title="Ivo Karlović">
<text>Ivo Karlović (; born 28 February 1979) is a Croatian former professional tennis player. His height of 211 cm (6 ft 11 in) makes him the joint tallest ranked tennis player in history, along with Reilly Opelka. He won eight ATP Tour singles titles between 2007 and 2016. He is a serve-and-volleyer and officially held the record for the fastest serve recorded in professional tennis, measured at 251 km/h (156 mph), before being surpassed unofficially by Samuel Groth in 2012, and officially by John Isner in 2016. In his prime, he was considered one of the best servers on tour, and held the record for career aces from 1991 onwards with 13,728 (not including Davis Cup) before the record was broken by Isner on July 1 2022. This makes him one of only five players since 1991 to surpass 10,000 aces. His height enabled him to serve with high speed and unique trajectory.
==Junior career==
Karlović played his first junior match in April 1995 at the age of 16 at a grade 3 tournament in Croatia. He played only eight tournament throughout his junior career (four singles and four doubles). In singles, he defeated a 15-year-old Marat Safin at the 1995 Junior Davis Cup. In doubles, he was known for partnering future world No. 3 Ivan Ljubičić on numerous occasions.

Karlović ended his junior career with no ranking in both singles or doubles. He had an overall win–loss record of 2–5 in singles and 5–3 in doubles.

==Professional career==
===1998–2004: Beginning===
Although not turning pro until 2000 at the age of 21, Karlović played his first ITF futures event in June 1998 and made two finals in August 1998 and September 1999, losing both. He played his first Challenger event in December 1999.
Karlović debuted for the Croatian Davis Cup team in 2000 against Ireland, where he won the dead rubber. Karlović appeared in a starting line-up for the first time in 2002 against Argentina in Buenos Aires, but he lost to Juan Ignacio Chela in the second rubber and to Gastón Gaudio in the fifth and decisive rubber. He has posted a 4–2 career record (2–2 in singles) in three ties since 2000.

Karlović caused a major upset at Wimbledon when he beat defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in his first match in a Grand Slam tournament. As of 2015, Karlović remains the only player in Open tennis history, and only the second player after Charlie Pasarell, to defeat the defending Wimbledon men&#x27;s singles champion in the first round. He finished the 2003 year in the top 100 and as the Croatian No. 3, behind Ivan Ljubičić and Mario Ančić. He also averaged an ATP-best of 17.6 aces per match. He continued his success during the 2004 season, winning at Calabasas, California. He reached the round of sixteen in several tournaments, including Wimbledon.

===2005: First ATP final===
In 2005, Karlović reached his first ATP final at the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships, defeating Lleyton Hewitt and Thomas Johansson along the way. In the final he lost to Andy Roddick. There were no breaks of serve in the match. Afterwards, Roddick said Karlović&#x27;s serve is &quot;probably the biggest weapon in tennis... you don&#x27;t really get a feel for it unless you are on the other side. It was not fun at times.&quot;

At the 2005 US Open, Karlović lost to eventual runner-up Andre Agassi in three tiebreakers. On 19 October 2005, he finally defeated Roddick in the Madrid Masters event. In November 2005, he was a member of the Croatian team that won the Davis Cup. He did not play in the finals, but played in a semifinal dead rubber.

===2006: Breaking into the top 50 in singles and doubles===
On 26 February 2006, he won his first ATP Doubles Tournament with South African Chris Haggard, beating James Blake and Mardy Fish in the 2006 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup, Memphis, USA. On 27 February, he reached a career high of No. 47 in doubles and on 8 May he also reached the top 50 in singles.

===2007: First ATP title and breaking top 30===
Karlović and Roger Federer were the only players who won titles on three different surfaces during the 2007 season.

At age 28, he won his first ATP singles title at the 2007 U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, defeating Mariano Zabaleta in the final. On 29 May 2007 at the French Open, he defeated eighth seed James Blake in the first round. In the next round he lost to Jonas Björkman in five sets.

On 23 June 2007, he won his second title of the year and his career at Nottingham, the last grass tune-up before Wimbledon, defeating seventh seed Stanislas Wawrinka, Gilles Simon, Juan Martín del Potro, second seed Dmitry Tursunov (a match played on indoor hard courts due to torrential rain), and Arnaud Clément. Despite a first-round loss at Wimbledon, he rose to No. 40, making his top-40 debut.

On 14 October 2007, he won his third title of the year by taking the Stockholm Open, defeating former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson in three sets in the final. Earlier, Karlović had yet again met Frenchman Arnaud Clément in his quarterfinal, the pair having met five times that year alone, including in the final of Nottingham, where Karlović secured his second career title. Karlović edged past his rival after saving a match point in the final-set tiebreak, and then went on to defeat German No. 1 Tommy Haas in the semifinals.

===2008: Fourth ATP title and breaking top 15===
At the 2008 Australian Open, Karlović entered the men&#x27;s doubles tournament with John Isner, making them the tallest doubles pair in history. Despite losing in the first round, Karlović said &quot;It was a lot of fun. We will win together next time.&quot;

Karlović defeated world No. 1 Roger Federer in the third round of the Cincinnati Masters on 31 July 2008. This was his first victory in seven matches against Federer. It was this loss which caused Federer to lose his No. 1 ranking to Rafael Nadal. Karlović then advanced to the semifinals where he lost to eventual champion Andy Murray. This was his career-best result in a top-level tournament.

At the US Open, Karlović fell to Sam Querrey in straight sets.

At the 2008 Madrid Masters, he stunned World No. 3 Novak Djokovic in two tie-breaker sets serving 20 aces to seal victory in 1 hour and 42 minutes. However, he lost in the quarterfinals to Frenchman Gilles Simon, being dominated in the tiebreaks.

===2009: First Grand Slam quarterfinal===

At Wimbledon 2009, he powered through the first two rounds, beating Lukáš Lacko and Steve Darcis. In the next two rounds he needed only one break of serve in the third set to defeat both ninth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and seventh seed Fernando Verdasco, advancing to face Roger Federer in his first quarterfinal at a Grand Slam. The match was a relatively one-sided affair, with Federer winning in straight sets and going on to win the tournament.

In the 2009 Davis Cup semifinals, Karlović was defeated by Radek Štěpánek, despite hitting a record-breaking 78 aces (the record has since been taken by John Isner). The match was one of the longest in the history of the Davis Cup, lasting 5 hours, 59 minutes. There were only three breaks of serve in this match.

Karlović also won his first five-set match in the Davis Cup quarterfinals against the United States, where he came from behind to beat James Blake from two sets down.

===2010: Australian Open fourth found, Injury and absence===
Karlović met Štěpánek again at the 2010 Australian Open, in another five-set marathon. This time, the 13-seeded Štěpánek lost. In all five-set matches Karlović has played, this was only his second win. He went on to reach a career-best fourth round there, after beating Julien Benneteau (in four sets), and Ivan Ljubičić (also in four sets). After giving a solid performance, he was ousted by the second seed and defending champion Rafael Nadal in that round.

As the second seed at the 2010 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, he made a runner-up effort, losing to first-time ATP-finalist Ernests Gulbis.

In the 2010 Davis Cup, where Croatia had a first-round clash with Ecuador, Karlović defeated Nicolás Lapentti in five sets. This was his third five-set match win, following his five-set win over Štěpánek at the Australian Open. His five-set record then stood at 3–12.

Karlović was forced to withdraw from 2010 Wimbledon due to a foot injury.

===2011–13: Rankings fall and fifth ATP title===

February 2011 saw Karlović temporarily exit from the top 200. In 2012, Karlović beat Dudi Sela in the first round of Wimbledon in straight sets, but was knocked out in the second round by Andy Murray. Karlović controversially accused Wimbledon of being biased, as he was pulled up for approximately 11-foot faults.

In 2013, Karlović suffered from viral meningitis, which was not immediately diagnosed. He was unconscious for some time, and when he woke up, he did not know his name or what year it was. After a lengthy recovery, he was able to play again in Newport in July, where he made it to the quarterfinals, before being defeated by John Isner in one of their typical ace-fests.

In Bogota, also in July, he won his fifth ATP title, beating Alejandro Falla in the final. He did not qualify for the Rogers Cup or Cincinnati Masters.

At the US Open, he made it through qualifying and into the second round by defeating James Blake in the last singles match of his career in five sets. In the second round, he met Stanislas Wawrinka, to whom he lost in straight sets.

===2014: Four ATP finals and return to top 30===
In February, Karlović reached the final of the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships, losing to Kei Nishikori. In May, he reached the final of the Düsseldorf Open, losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber. In July, he reached the final of the Hall of Fame Open, losing an epic match to Lleyton Hewitt. Another solid week of tennis saw him make back-to-back finals, this time at the Claro Open Colombia, losing to Bernard Tomic in a tight three-setter. He avenged that loss the following month at the Rogers Cup in another tight three-setter.

===2015: Sixth ATP title and return to top 20===
Karlović won his sixth title, defeating Donald Young at the Delray Beach Open. He also won the 2015 Topshelf Open in doubles with Łukasz Kubot. He reached his second Hall of Fame Open final, which he lost to Rajeev Ram in three sets.

===2016: Seventh &amp; eight titles as oldest champion since 1979, return to top 20===

Karlović suffered a knee injury and missed two months of play.

He reached the final of the Hall of Fame Open for the third time against Gilles Müller, which he won in three tiebreaks. At the age of 37 and 5 months, he became the oldest player to win an ATP title since 1979. He reached an ATP World Tour 500 series tournament at the Washington Open (tennis), which he lost to Gaël Monfils.

He then won the Los Cabos Open, beating Feliciano López in straight sets and returned to the top 20 again at 37 years and 6 months.

===2017: 75 Aces at Australian Open===
Karlović began the Australian Open by defeating Horacio Zeballos in a 5-hour, 15-minute match, the second-longest match at the tournament in the Open Era (behind the Djokovic–Nadal final in 2012). He set an Australian Open record, hitting 75 aces.

Aged 38, Karlović set up the oldest ATP Tour tournament final in 41 years against Gilles Muller, aged 34, at the 2017 Ricoh Open. He lost in straight sets.

===2018: Defying age===
At the Australian Open, Karlović progressed to the Round of 32, losing to Andreas Seppi, 7–9 in the fifth set.

At the Ecuador Open in Quito, Karlović made it to the Round of 16, losing to 18 years old Corentin Moutet in a third-set tie-break.

Next, he reached the quarterfinals at New York Open losing to second seed Sam Querrey.

After a string of tight first round losses at Delray Beach Open, Indian Wells Masters and Miami Open (tennis), the U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Houston saw Karlović reach the semifinals with wins over Japanese Taro Daniel, Denis Kudla and 4th seed Nick Kyrgios. In the semifinals, he lost to eventual runner-up Tennys Sandgren in two close tie-break sets.

At Wimbledon, he reached the second round. At the US Open, he was defeated in the second round of qualifying.

In October, he became the oldest champion of an ATP Challenger tournament, winning the Calgary Challenger at 39 years and seven months.

=== 2019: Oldest ATP finalist since 1977 ===
At the Maharashtra Open Karlović beat teenager Félix Auger-Aliassime in first round. The age gap of 21 years and 6 months between the two players was the largest on the ATP Tour since 2011. Karlović and Auger-Aliassime were the oldest and the youngest players in the Top 200 ATP rankings at the beginning of the 2019 season. He went on to make the final, at 39 years and 10 months becoming the oldest finalist on the ATP Tour since 43-year-old Ken Rosewall won the 1977 Hong Kong championship.

With his victory over Matthew Ebden at the Indian Wells Masters, he became the first player aged over 40 to win an ATP Tour match since Jimmy Connors in 1995 in Halle. In addition, Karlović was the oldest to win a match in ATP Masters 1000 history.

=== 2021-2024: 63rd Grand Slam appearance, Retirement ===
At the 2021 Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Karlovic won against 24-year-old Bernabé Zapata Miralles. This was only his second match win for 2021, the first being at the 2021 Delray Beach Open against Pablo Andújar. At 42 years old, Karlovic was the oldest player to compete in an ATP Tour match since Thomas Muster, 44, in 2011 in Vienna (l. to Dominic Thiem in R1).

In July, Los Cabos Open organisers circulated news of Karlović&#x27;s retirement at the 2021 US Open. Later, he said he may change his mind and continue playing in 2022 if he got good results.

Karlović entered the US Open qualifying draw for possibly his last tournament. He won all three of his qualifying matches to qualify for the US Open, making him the second-oldest Grand Slam qualifier in the Open Era after Mal Anderson qualified for the 1977 Australian Open. It was his 17th Grand Slam draw participation at the US Open and the 63rd overall Grand Slam main draw appearance for the 42-year-old. He lost in the first round to 5th seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets.

He officially retired in February 2024 after two-and-a-half years of inactivity. He had been listed as a retired player by the International Tennis Integrity Agency since 15 June 2023.

==National representation==
Karlović has been absent from some previous Croatian Davis Cup campaigns owing to his dispute with the Croatian Tennis Association. He further strained his relations with the Croatian Tennis Association and the Croatian Olympic Committee by his last-minute withdrawal from the Olympic tournament in Beijing, communicated via an SMS message.

He played against Japan in the first round in 2012 in Japan with wins over Kei Nishikori and Go Soeda in singles and in doubles winning with Dodig.

In 2016, he accepted an invitation to the Davis Cup final against Argentina. He played the second match, losing against Juan Martín del Potro, and had to play the last deciding match, again losing against Federico Delbonis.

==Performance timelines==

===Doubles===
==Style of play==
Karlović plays a very offensive and powerful playing style. His best and most powerful weapon is his serve. His height of 2.11 meters makes his serve very powerful and it is regarded as one of if not the best in tennis history. He has hit 13,762 aces during his career, the second most in all of ATP history.

Besides his huge serve, Karlović also has a powerful forehand which he usually hits deep and fast into his opponent&#x27;s baseline. On his backhand side, he usually slices the ball deep into his opponent&#x27;s baseline and rarely uses the one-handed backhand drive that he possesses.

Karlović is also known as a serve-and-volleyer. His serve usually causes players to return the ball lightly, at which point he will come forward on the ball and volley it. His skill at the net is one of the key traits of his playing style.

===Serving records===

On 18 September 2009, Karlović hit 78 aces (77 aces on 1st serve) in a Davis Cup match against Radek Štěpánek, breaking his previous record of 51 (against Daniele Bracciali in the 2005 Wimbledon Championships) and 55 (against Lleyton Hewitt in the 2009 French Open). Only once in his ATP career has he failed to hit an ace during a match, which was in the 2008 Monte Carlo Masters against Frenchman Gaël Monfils. His record of aces in a single match was broken by both John Isner and Nicolas Mahut in the longest match in tennis history at the first round of the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, where Isner hit 113 aces and Mahut hit 103.

In 2007, Karlović became the fourth player since 1991 to serve 1,000 aces in a season. He finished the year with 1,318 aces, second behind Goran Ivanišević, who hit 1,477 in 1996. In 2015, he became the third player since 1991 (after Goran Ivanišević and Andy Roddick) to serve 9,000 career aces., and the second to notch 10,000 aces.

Karlović&#x27;s fastest official serve is , which he hit during his five-set loss in the 2011 Davis Cup first round third rubber doubles match with Ivan Dodig against Christopher Kas and Philipp Petzschner of Germany. That was ATP&#x27;s official record at the time. His previous record was in a victory over Arnaud Clément in the final of Nottingham in 2007. This is the third-fastest first serve on record, after Andy Roddick&#x27;s . He also hit a second serve against Paul Capdeville in the quarterfinals of the 2007 Legg Mason Tennis Classic on 3 August, which is the fastest second serve on record.

Karlovic&#x27;s record of a 156 mph serve was broken by Samuel Groth at the 2012 ATP Challenger in Busan, but was still the record for ATP events until John Isner broke the record in 2016.

On 19 June 2015 Karlović broke the record for most aces in a three-set ATP Tour match during the quarterfinal of 2015 Gerry Weber Open. He served 45 aces in a 7–5, 6–7(8–10), 6–3 win over Tomáš Berdych.

Karlović held the record for the most aces since 1991 after surpassing Goran Ivanišević in October 2015. As of September 2021, he has struck 13,728 aces in 694 matches (not including Davis Cup). This record was surpassed by John Isner in June 2022, who hit his 13,729th ace in a third round match at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships.

==Personal life==
During Karlović&#x27;s childhood, his mother Gordana worked in agriculture, while his father Vlado was a meteorologist.

<text>Lycia is an American dark wave band formed in 1988 in Tempe, Arizona. The main personnel of the band are Mike VanPortfleet, Tara VanFlower and David Galas. Although only achieving minor cult success, the band is notable for being one of the ground breaking groups in darkwave and ethereal wave styles. Their 1995 album &quot;The Burning Circle and Then Dust&quot; received some attention for the power pop hit song &quot;Pray&quot; and &quot;remains a high point of American dark rock&quot;, according to AllMusic. Lycia&#x27;s music is characterized by rich soundscapes and layers of echoed guitars, dark and ethereal keyboards, doomy drum machine beats, VanPortfleet&#x27;s melancholic, whispered vocals and Vanflower&#x27;s vivid voice. Trent Reznor and Peter Steele are some of their more well-known fans.

==History==
After Mike VanPortfleet started Lycia in 1988 as a solo project, in the summer of that year he met Will Welch, who joined for the project. In November, Welch was replaced by John Fair. In March 1989, Lycia&#x27;s first recording, &quot;Wake&quot;, a 6-song demo tape, is released on Orphanage Records. The sound is characterized at the time by dominating rock guitars and rhythm patterns of drum computer. &quot;Wake&quot; was unique in that it was mastered directly onto an audio cassette tape, as opposed to the more professional multitrack recording that Lycia would henceforth use.

John Fair left Lycia in 1990, and Will Welch returned. The sound of Lycia increasingly evolved into a heavy-noise or harsh industrial direction. At the end of that year, Lycia began work on the first full-length album entitled &quot;Byzantine&quot;, but due to technical problems it never appeared. Mike VanPortfleet decided to gather the individual fragments of the album for a second start-up process. The final outcome was in September 1991 under the title &quot;Ionia&quot; on the label Projekt Records and is characterized by ambient textures and very flat and atmospheric sounds.

Meanwhile, production on the next album, &quot;A Day in the Stark Corner&quot;, was already in full swing. This was published in June 1993 and follows technically seamlessly as the successor to &quot;Ionia&quot;. A short California tour followed. Soon it turned the occupation and the sound again. The line-up was extended by David Galas. Under the project name Bleak, they began work on the album &quot;Vane&quot;, but in a much more rough direction. In return, in the main project Lycia, new tracks were prepared, increasingly emphasizing on acoustic guitars. The line-up was reinforced by the singer Tara VanFlower, and this material was released in 1995 as a double CD under the name &quot;The Burning Circle and Then Dust&quot;. The album introduced the power pop hit &quot;Pray&quot;. Following the release, Lycia played concerts opening for Type O Negative. In June 1995, Lycia traveled to Chicago, IL, to perform in the first gothic Convergence festival.

It was followed by &quot;Cold&quot; in 1996, representing the group&#x27;s bleakest sounds yet, another landmark in the darkwave genre. 1998&#x27;s &quot;Estrella&quot; saw a more experimental output with otherworldly sounds. In 1999 they started their own label called Lycium Music. Under the title &quot;Estraya&quot; was released an EP titled &quot;The Time Has Come and Gone&quot; with songs based on ambient soundscapes and acoustic guitars. With the same sound approach, but under the name of the main project Lycia, in 2002 they released the album &quot;Tripping Back Into The Broken Days&quot;. The same year some songs from &quot;Cold&quot; were licensed for the film titled &quot;Lana&#x27;s Rain&quot;. In January 2001 the band&#x27;s former label, Projekt Records, released &quot;Compilation Appearances Vol. 1&quot;, and &quot;Compilation Appearances Vol. 2&quot; in July 2001, without Lycia&#x27;s involvement, featuring songs recorded in Arizona during the early 1990s.

In October 2003, two months later, Lycia quit their label Projekt Records, and their last album titled &quot;Empty Space&quot; was released on Silber Records. VanPortfleet released his first solo work in 2004, an ambient album entitled &quot;Beyond The Horizon Line&quot;. Tara VanFlower (now married to Mike VanPortfleet) and David Galas have also since recorded their own solo releases. Vanflower recorded &quot;This Womb Like Liquid Honey&quot;, &quot;My Little Fire-Filled Heart&quot;, and has performed two solo live shows, including the Cornerstone Festival in Illinois. David Galas released &quot;The Cataclysm&quot; in 2006, &quot;The Happiest Days Of My Life&quot; in 2009 and &quot;The Ghosts Of California&quot; in 2011. After several years of inactivity, Lycia announced on their Facebook and MySpace pages a digital-only release titled &quot;Fifth Sun&quot;, released on June 22, 2010.

On December 5, 2012, Lycia announced a new release, &quot;Quiet Moments&quot;, through their Facebook page. It was released on August 20, 2013.

On October 26, 2014, Lycia announced that David Galas had rejoined the band and that they were recording a new album titled &quot;A Line That Connects&quot;, scheduled to be released in August 2015.

On November 9, 2018, Lycia released their full-length LP &quot;In Flickers&quot; on Projekt Records. It is available at the Projekt Records site.

==Musical style==

Lycia have been recognized as pioneers in darkwave music. Over the band&#x27;s career they have also incorporated elements of post-punk, ethereal wave, ambient, industrial, and electronic music. In a review for Pitchfork, Andy O&#x27;Conner describes Quiet Moments as &quot;a somber, but beautiful collection that offers an intriguing meditation on mystery and loss&quot;. Author Eugene Thacker, in an interview with Lycia, describes their music: &quot;This is dark music is at once wide open and closed in upon itself, a wall of sound that disintegrates into an ambient haze of lethargic rhythms and world-weary chord changes.&quot;

<text>John Thomas Allen (September 30, 1904 – March 29, 1959) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB), who played for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn Dodgers, and New York Giants.

==Early life==
Born in Lenoir, North Carolina, Allen spent part of his youth in the Baptist orphanage in Thomasville, North Carolina, and he attended Thomasville High School.

==Baseball career==
Allen reached the Yankees in an unusual way. While working as a bellhop in a hotel, he was told to take some fans to the room of Yankee scout Paul Krichell. Allen told Krichell that he was a pitcher, and the scout arranged a tryout. Allen was an immediate success for the Yankees, debuting in with a 17–4 record and a 3.70 earned run average (ERA) for the world champions. He was less stellar in that year&#x27;s World Series, starting Game 4 and leaving after giving up three runs off five hits in just of an inning.

Allen continued to post decent records for the Yankees, but a sore arm and his constant demands for more money threatened his career. For these reasons, Allen was dealt to the Indians before the season.
Allen turned things around in Cleveland, going 20–10 with a 3.44 ERA in 1936 and following that up by winning his first fifteen decisions of , one short of the record held by Walter Johnson. Allen lost his next start 1–0 on an unearned run, but his 15–1 mark that year set a winning percentage record that lasted until Roy Face bettered it with an 18–1 record in . In , Allen won his first twelve decisions and made his only All-Star team. During the All-Star break, he suffered an unknown injury, some claim he slipped on a bar of soap in the shower, and never did approach his earlier success again, finally retiring in after six mediocre campaigns. Allen&#x27;s finished his 13-year career with a 142–75 record and one of the best winning percentages (.654) in MLB history.

After retiring as a player, Allen became a minor league umpire, eventually becoming the umpire-in-chief of the Carolina League. He was posthumously inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, in 1977.

==Death==
On March 29, 1959, Allen died in St. Petersburg, Florida; in retirement, he had been involved in the real estate business. Allen was 54 years old.

==Career summary==
As a hitter, Allen posted a .173 career batting average (124-for-716), with 82 runs, four home runs, 64 runs batted in (RBI), and 33 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .957 lifetime fielding percentage.

==Tributes from peers==
Baseball Hall of Fame member Al Simmons named Allen the toughest pitcher for him to hit and Hall of Fame slugger Hank Greenberg named Allen among the five toughest pitchers he faced in his career.

<doc id="933666" wikidata="Q1478038" url="?curid=933666" title="Ullucus">
<text>Ullucus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Basellaceae, with one species, Ullucus tuberosus, a plant grown primarily as a root vegetable, secondarily as a leaf vegetable. The name &quot;ulluco&quot; is derived from the Quechua word , but depending on the region, it has many different names. These include &quot;illaco&quot; (in Aymara), &quot;melloco&quot; (in Ecuador), &quot;chungua&quot; or &quot;ruba&quot; (in Colombia), &quot;olluco&quot; or &quot;papa&quot; &quot;lisa&quot; (in Bolivia and Peru), or &quot;ulluma&quot; (in Argentina).

Ulluco is one of the most widely grown and economically important root crops in the Andean region of South America, second only to the potato. The tuber is the primary edible part, but the leaf is also used and is similar to spinach. They are known to contain high levels of protein, calcium, and carotene. Ulluco was used by the Incas prior to the arrival of Europeans in South America. The scrambling herbaceous plant grows up to high and forms starchy tubers below ground. These tubers are typically smooth and can be spherical or elongated. Generally they are a similar in size to the potato; however, they have been known to grow up to long. Due to the brightly coloured waxy skin in a variety of yellows, pinks and purples, ullucus tubers are regarded as one of the most striking foods in the Andean markets.

&quot;Ullucus tuberosus&quot; has a subspecies, &quot;Ullucus tuberosus&quot; subsp. &quot;aborigineus&quot;, which is considered a wild type. While the domesticated varieties are generally erect and have a diploid genome, the subspecies is generally a trailing vine and has a triploid genome.

==Vernacular names==
Aymara: , .

Quechua: , .

Spanish: , , , , , .

English: &quot;Ulluco&quot;

==Origin==
It is probable that ulluco was brought into cultivation more than 4000 years ago. Biological material from several coastal Peruvian archaeological sites have been found to contain starch grains and xylem of the ulluco plant, suggesting domestication occurred between the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. Illustrations and representations of ulluco on wooden vessels (keros), ceramic urns and sculptures have been used to date the presence and importance of these tubers back to 2250 BC.

Although it lost some importance due to the influx of European vegetables following the Spanish conquest in 1531, Ulluco still remains a staple crop in the Andean regions. However, in comparison to the potato which is now cultivated in over 130 countries, outside of South America the ulluco tubers are still relatively unknown. Initial attempts were made to cultivate it in Europe in the 1850s following the potato blights but were not successful on a large scale due to its requirements for cultivation.

==Importance and uses==

Ullucos are cultivated for their edible tubers by subsistence farmers in high-altitude farming systems around above sea level. The tubers are usually eaten in indigenous soups and stews, but more contemporary dishes incorporate them into salads along with the ulluco leaves. These tubers have been eaten in the Andean populations since ancient times and still to this day provide an important protein, carbohydrate and vitamin C source to people living in the high altitude mountainous regions of South America.

The major appeal of ulluco is its crisp texture, which, like the jicama, remains even when cooked. Because of its high water content, ulluco is not suitable for frying or baking, but it can be cooked in many other ways like the potato. In the pickled form, it is added to hot sauces. They are generally cut into thin strips. In order to increase their shelf life, a typical product is produced by the Quechua and Aymara communities in Peru called &quot;chuño&quot; or &quot;lingli&quot;. This is produced via a process involving environmental freezing and drying which is usually then ground into a fine flour and added to cooked foods. In Bolivia, they grow to be very colorful and decorative, though with their sweet and unique flavor they are rarely used for decoration. When boiled or broiled they remain moist; the texture and flavor are very similar to the meat of the boiled peanut without the skin. Unlike the peanut meat becoming soft and mushy, ulluco remain firm and almost crunchy.

They are a traditional food in Catholic Holy Week celebrations in Bolivia.

==Production==

===Climate requirements===
Ulluco is normally propagated vegetatively by planting small whole tubers. However, they are also easily propagated by stem or tuber cuttings. They prefer cooler climates and will produce much better yields in full sun where summer temperatures are relatively cool. They are also known to grow in hotter regions when covered with shade. They are short day plants which require around 11-13.5 hours of day length. However, due to the inherent diversity of ulluco, sun exposure needs vary among cultivars and location. As the day length shortens, stolons grow out of the stems and then develop into tubers.

===Fertilization, chemical growth, regulators, field management===
Ulluco is grown in the highlands and can survive in altitudes of up to above sea level. Indigenous Andean farmers regularly grow a large number of different cultivars of ulluco together in the same fields. Ulluco crop is alternated with two other Andean tuber crops known as oca and mashua. These different tubers are planted together in relatively small field and harvested after approximately eight months. The different species are then separated following harvest.

===Harvest and postharvest treatment===
Ulluco tubers need to be dug by hand due to their sensitivity to scarring. Due to the importance of their appearance, scuffing of their skin is likely a problem. Under traditional cultivation conditions, yield range from five to nine tons per hectare however in intensive systems, they have been known to reach 40 tons per hectares. These tubers can be stored year-round in the Andes but are best stored in the dark as exposure to the sun can cause fading of their vibrant colouring.

Usually a proportion of the smaller tubers from the harvest are preserved for use as seed tubers the following year. The remainder of the harvest is most often used for consumption however there has been an increasing trend for ulluco use as a cash crop at the markets.

===Diseases, viruses, pests===
The ulluco is popular among Andean farmers for not having pest and disease issues. However, it has the potential to be host to viruses such as &quot;Tymovirus&quot;. &quot;Tymovirus&quot; is similar to the Andean potato latent virus. This could threaten potato crops, as well as other crops in the family Solanaceae (tomatoes, aubergines, peppers). Other species in the family Amaranthaceae (spinach, beet, quinoa) may also be at risk. These viruses pose no risk to human or animal health. The ulluco can be legally imported to the EU with a phytosanitary certificate, but caution is advised. Other viruses of ulluco include the Arracacha virus A, Papaya mosaic virus, Potato leaf roll virus, Potato virus T, Ulluco mild mosaic virus, Ulluco mosaic virus, and Ulluco virus C. Most heirloom ulluco have diseases, but if cultivated from a seed these can be avoided. Ullucus cultivated from clean seed tubers can increase yield by 30-50%. There are clones being developed to eliminate viruses, and these also have been shown to raise yields by 30-50%. The ulluco is susceptible to Verticillium wilt, a soil organism, at low altitudes and high temperatures. There are fumigants available to fight Verticillium, or, for organic farmers, annual rotations into soil that has not been infected for 2–3 years. Ulluco is also susceptible to Rhizoctonia solani, though not as susceptible as the potato. This pathogen can reduce the amount and quality of the yield. Slugs and snails are common pests, though generally only cause cosmetic damage to the ulluco.

===Breeding===
The ulluco has a limited ability to produce a seed. It was thought to be infertile until researchers in Finland produced a seed in the 1980s. This low fertility poses a challenge when trying to breed this crop. This infertility is thought to be due to the long history of cultivation by planting tubers. However, the ullucus has high genetic diversity, in terms of color, protein content, and tuber yield. It is thought this diversity arises from somatic mutations or from sexual regeneration. Ullucus is primarily bred from seed tubers, but it is also possible by seed and stem cuttings. In New Zealand there have been experiments to induce mutation by gamma radiation and produce more varieties.

===Research needs===
There may be potential for much higher yields of ulluco and a larger role in the world food system. Potential research into virus free varieties, the photoperiod, and seed producing varieties could expedite this. This could allow for manipulation of colors and other genetic factors. This could also lead to an increased adaptability for ullucus to be grown around the world.

==Cultivars==
The majority of accessions are diploids (2n=24). Triploids (2n=36) and tetraploids (2n=48) are rare. With 187 accessions evaluated with 18 morphological descriptors, 108 morphotypes or groups have been identified. Considering that the reproduction of the species is vegetative and that the production and use of the germination of botanical seeds is very rare, morphological diversity of the ulluco can be seen as high.

The main characteristics that determine the choice of farmers for cultivars are sweetness, storage capacity before consumption, mucilage content and yield. Skin color is also a key parameter to consider while assessing the potential of the ulluco culture. Red tuber plants are the most frost-resistant and yellow tubers are the most popularly eaten in markets in Ecuador. The attractiveness of the color of cultivars varies among countries and regions. In the New-Zealand market, the preferred skin color was red over plain yellow and mixtures of yellow, green and red. Unusual and unfamiliar colors may explain why some multicolored crops or crops with different colored spots are not appreciated by consumers of New-Zealand.

==Nutrition==
Fresh tubers of ulluco are a valuable source of carbohydrates, comparable to one of the most world spread root crop, the potato. It contains also high fiber levels, moderate protein and only little fat (&lt; 2%). Regarding the vitamin content, ulluco tubers contain a significant value of vitamin C (11.5 mg/100 g), higher than the commonly eaten vegetables such as carrots (6 mg/100 g) and celery but lower than yams (17.1 mg/100 g) or potato (19.7 mg/100 g).
Dietary value variability is pronounced between cultivars.

Little is known about the nutrition content of the leaves. They are nutritious and contain 12% protein dry weight.

===Carbohydrates===

The carbohydrates of ulluco are composed mainly of starch. But there is also a significant amount of mucilage, a heterogeneous and complex polysaccharide that is recognized as a type of soluble fiber. The mucilage level varies among tubers, high content gives to the raw tubers a gummy texture. Soaked in water or cut very finely are methods used to remove the greatest amount of mucilage from raw tubes. The characteristic is also reduced or lost for cooked tubers. In South America, ulluco tubers with high mucilage content are popular for soups because they add a thicker texture.

===Proteins===
The proteins contained in the ulluco tubers are a source of amino acids as they contain all the essential amino acids in the human diet: lysine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine+tyrosine, tryptophan and methionine+cystine.

===Antioxidant activity===
Ulluco is a crop that contains betalains pigments in the base form of betacyanins and acid form of betaxanthins. Thirty two types of betalains have been reported in Ulluco, 20 in the form of betaxanthins and the remaining 12 in the form of betacyanins. Red or purple tuber varieties appear to have a high concentration of betacyanins. A high concentration of betaxanthins is responsible for the yellow or orange coloring of the tubers. In comparison to the three other Andean tuber crops - native potato, oca, and mashua - the antioxidant capacity of the ulluco is low. This is in part explained by the absence of flavonoids, carotenoids and anthocyanins pigments in Ulluco. These pigments are much more abundant sources of antioxidant compounds than betalains. The stability of the betalains pigments makes ulluco a promising industrial crop of natural pigments.

=== Comparison to staple root foods===
This table shows the nutrient content of ulluco next to other major staple root crops – potato, sweet potato, cassava, and yam. Taken individually, potato, sweet potato, cassava, and yam, rank among the most important food crops in the world in respect of annual volume of production. Together, their annual production is about 736.747 million tonnes (FAO, 2008). 
Comparing to these staple root and tuber crops, the nutritional value of ulluco is good and promising for the geographical extent of the crop.

The nutritional content for each of the crops listed in the table is measured in its raw state, although staple foods are usually sprouted or cooked before consumption rather than consumed raw. The nutritional composition of the product in sprouted or cooked form may deviate from the values presented. The nutrient composition of the ulluco is given within a range, based on the results of nutritional analyses of ulluco grown in South America.

<text>The Motels are an American new wave band from Berkeley, California, that is best known for the singles &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; and &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot;, each of which peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, in 1982 and 1983, respectively. In 1980, The Motels&#x27; song &quot;Total Control&quot; reached No. 7 on the Australian chart (for two weeks), and their song &quot;Danger&quot; reached No. 15 on the French chart.

Martha Davis, the lead singer, reformed a version of the band called &quot;The Motels featuring Martha Davis&quot; in 1998 and toured under that name with various lineups of musicians. Since 2013, they have been billed as Martha Davis and The Motels.

== History ==

===First incarnation===

The first incarnation of The Motels formed in Berkeley, California in 1971. Lisa Brenneis (bass) persuaded Dean Chamberlain (lead guitar), Chuck Wada (rhythm guitar) and Martha Davis (vocals, guitar) to form a band (then called The Warfield Foxes). Hoping for better exposure and seeking a recording contract, the Warfield Foxes moved to Los Angeles in 1975. While in Los Angeles, Lisa Brenneis left and the band first changed its name to Angels of Mercy, then to The Motels. Both Davis and Wada contributed original songs to the band&#x27;s repertoire. Around this time, bass guitarist Richard D&#x27;Andrea and drummer Robert Newman joined The Motels, making the band a quintet (Chamberlain, D&#x27;Andrea, Davis, Newman and Wada).

The Motels and two other local bands, The Pop and The Dogs, participated in a self-produced show titled Radio Free Hollywood at Troupers Hall, a performance space at a home for retired actors. Before this show, few if any unsigned bands played local high-profile clubs like the Whisky a Go Go and The Roxy Theatre. The Motels then appeared on Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s popular radio show on KROQ. The Motels recorded a demo for Warner Bros. Records, but the record label turned it down. Capitol Records offered the band a recording contract. At this point, The Motels rejected the Capitol offer and disbanded, citing musical differences among the band members. One song from their Warner Bros. demo, &quot;Counting&quot;, was included on the Rhino Records compilation &quot;Saturday Night Pogo&quot;, released in 1978. Another demo from this line-up, &quot;Every Day Star&quot;, was released on their compilation CD &quot;Anthologyland&quot;.

Chamberlain created the band Code Blue, which signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records. D&#x27;Andrea joined the Pits and later the Know. Newman became an art director and designer and Wada a financial advisor. Brenneis wrote a series of books on Final Cut Pro editing software .

===Second incarnation===
In March 1978, Davis and lead guitarist Jeff Jourard (formerly of a pre-fame version of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) decided to reform The Motels. Extensive auditions resulted in a new line-up of the band, consisting of Jourard&#x27;s brother Marty, who played both the saxophone and keyboards, Michael Goodroe on bass, and Brian Glascock on drums.

Short on funds, The Motels shared rehearsal space with The Go-Go&#x27;s at The Masque in Hollywood. They played in Chinatown, Los Angeles, at Madame Wong&#x27;s restaurant/nightclub. The Motels began to draw crowds and in May 1979 the band signed a contract with Capitol Records. Four months later, Capitol released The Motels&#x27; debut album, &quot;The Motels&quot;. Their first single, &quot;Closets and Bullets&quot;, made no impact on the charts, but their second single release, &quot;Total Control&quot;, reached the Top 20 in France and the Top 10 in Australia.

In 1980, Jourard was replaced as lead guitarist on The Motels by Davis&#x27; boyfriend Tim McGovern and the band went back into the recording studio to record their second album, &quot;Careful&quot;. Released in June 1980, the album climbed to the No. 45 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the U.S. In Europe and the UK, the singles &quot;Days Are OK&quot; and &quot;Whose Problem?&quot; became Top 50 hits; &quot;Whose Problem?&quot; was also a top hit in Australia and &quot;Danger&quot; was a Top 20 hit in France.

The Motels hired record producer Val Garay for their third album, &quot;Apocalypso&quot;. The album was scheduled for release in November 1981. However, Capitol Records rejected the album, claiming that it was &quot;not commercial enough&quot; and &quot;too weird&quot;.

The Motels attempted to re-record the rejected album &quot;Apocalypso&quot;. During this process, Davis and McGovern&#x27;s relationship dissolved and by December 1981 McGovern had left The Motels (McGovern subsequently formed the band Burning Sensations). With extensive use of studio musicians, the band re-recorded &quot;Apocalypso&quot;. Craig Krampf, according to Garay, played all the drums on the record; Waddy Wachtel was featured on guitar, while bass duties were split among two studio players. Adrian Peritore (also known as Guy Perry) was hired in late January 1982 and played lead guitar on some of the tracks, including &quot;He Hit Me&quot;. Capitol released the album on April 5, 1982 under the new title &quot;All Four One&quot;.

The first single from &quot;All Four One&quot; was &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;, which reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart. The song &quot;Mission of Mercy&quot; also reached No. 23 on the Top Tracks chart. In addition, two other singles, &quot;Take the L&quot; and &quot;Forever Mine&quot;, also reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The release of &quot;All Four One&quot; coincided with the emergence of MTV on U.S. television. As a result, Capitol created music videos for both &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; and &quot;Take the L&quot;. In 1982, Davis won a Best Performance in a Music Video award category at the American Music Awards for her performance in the &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; video. During 1982, the band added keyboardist/guitarist Scott Thurston, formerly of Iggy and The Stooges, to their touring line-up.

Garay was now firmly in control of album and video production for The Motels, owned Record One, the studio where they recorded, and the rehearsal space where they prepared. After the band fired Fritz Turner Management, Garay also became the band manager. In February 1983, the band returned to the recording studio and released the album &quot;Little Robbers&quot; later that year. Again, Garay made extensive use of session musicians. For albums, The Motels line-up was Davis and a revolving cast of musicians; for concerts there was a definitive band that included Thurston on additional keyboards and guitars.

&quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot;, the first single from the album, hit No. 9 on the Hot 100 in the United States, with the album hitting No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Album Rock Tracks chart and going gold in the U.S., Canada, and several other countries. In August 1983, at the insistence of Garay, David Platshon was added on drums with Glascock reluctantly moving over to percussion.

The first leg of the Little Robbers tour, which included an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, started in January 1984 but ended abruptly in February with the firing of Garay as manager for personal reasons. Drummer Platshon was dropped, and Glascock resumed his spot on the drum throne. The band continued performing under new management, and they recorded songs for two film soundtracks: &quot;Long Day&quot; was recorded for &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; and &quot;In the Jungle&quot; was recorded for &quot;Teachers&quot;. By mid-summer, the band was back in the recording studio working on new material.

In late 1984, Capitol Records brought in producer Richie Zito in an attempt to maintain the band&#x27;s commercialism. After more than a year of recording, the group released their fifth album &quot;Shock&quot; in September 1985. The first single from the album was &quot;Shame&quot;, which reached No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 10 on the Top Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. Two other singles were taken from the album: the title track &quot;Shock&quot; and &quot;Icy Red&quot;, with the former peaking at No. 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. From early 1986 to February 1987, The Motels worked on songs for a planned sixth album. However, on February 13, 1987, Martha Davis took each member of the band in turn to a local bar to notify them that she had decided to dissolve the band and go solo.

All of the members of the 1982–1987 line-up of the band reunited in 2004 for an appearance on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;; rejoining Davis were Michael Goodroe, Marty Jourard, Brian Glascock and Adrian Peritore (a.k.a. Guy Perry). On August 9, 2011, the original version of The Motels&#x27; third album, &quot;Apocalypso&quot;, was released by Omnivore Recordings.

===Martha Davis&#x27; solo career===

Davis released her first solo album entitled &quot;Policy&quot; in November 1987. Musicians who worked with her included Clarence Clemons, Kenny G and Charlie Sexton. In November, she had a No. 8 hit in Australia with &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me the Time&quot;, but in the U.S. the song only reached No. 80. &quot;Just Like You&quot; reached No. 47 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The album&#x27;s critical reception was lukewarm, with many reviewers praising Davis&#x27; voice but noting that the album sounded lightweight and lacked atmospheric punch. Soon afterwards, Davis asked to be released from her contract with Capitol Records.

After leaving Capitol, Davis focused on different music styles and recorded songs for several film soundtracks but it appeared as if her music career was winding down. In the early 1990s she began performing occasional surprise gigs which found her experimenting with new songs that she had written.

Martha Davis has released several albums in the new millennium. She released &quot;...So the Story Goes&quot; in 2004, &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; in 2008, and in 2011, she released a children&#x27;s music album, &quot;Red Frog Presents: 16 Songs for Parents and Children&quot;.

===Third incarnation: The Motels featuring Martha Davis===

In 1997, Martha Davis began appearing live with a band composed of Erik Lemaire (guitar), Adrian Burke (bass), Jason Loree (drums), and David Van Pattoen (keyboards/guitar). This group began calling themselves &quot;Martha Davis Jr.&quot; and later &quot;The Motels&quot; in March 1998. After 1998, the line-up consisted of Mic Taras on lead guitar, Angelo Barbera on bass, Kevin Bowen on keyboards, Michael Barbera on keyboards/saxophone, and Jason Loree on drums. In 1999 Nick LeMieux joined the band on keyboards. The repertoire performed at these gigs consisted almost entirely of new material. In 2001 the band changed to a compact, four piece ensemble with Davis and Taras being accompanied by Fritz Lewak (drums) and David Sutton (bass). By 2004 the band had performed more than 70 concerts and toured in the U.S. and Australia. As of 2006 the band included Davis on vocal and guitar, Nick Johns (bass/keyboard), Eric Gardner (drums), Clint Walsh (guitar), and Jon Siebels (guitar).

In 2005 Davis and the new Motels released an independent CD titled &quot;So the Story Goes&quot; which sold out. Sony Records also released a live album titled &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;, which was recorded live in 2006 at the famed Coach House Club in San Juan Capistrano. The Motels featuring Martha Davis also appeared on the U.S. version of &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot; and toured the U.S. and Australia in 2007. Martha Davis performed at Seattle&#x27;s Teatro ZinZanni in 2005, for which she collaborated with TZ Maestro Norm Durkee to make the special CD &quot;Omnium&quot;, which is available only through the Teatro ZinZanni gift shop. In August 2007, she joined other 1970s and 1980s acts for the Australian concert series &quot;Countdown Spectacular 2&quot;.

The album &quot;Clean Modern and Reasonable&quot;, issued in September 2007, was the first release under the banner &quot;The Motels&quot; in 22 years. The album contains acoustic versions of past hits, B-sides and Davis solo material, including new recordings of &quot;Take The L&quot;, &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;, and &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot;. In April 2008 Martha Davis/The Motels released two new albums on the same day; The Motels&#x27; new studio album &quot;This&quot; and the Martha Davis solo project &quot;Beautiful Life&quot;. The solo album was billed as a darkly autobiographical journey through Davis&#x27; life.

The Motels 2009 summer tour found Martha Davis once again surrounding herself with all new musicians: Felix Mercer (keyboards), Matthew Brown (bass), Matthew Morgan (drums), and Matt Miller (guitar). However, previous members continued to play in the band in a mix-and-match arrangement depending on the venue.

At the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, Davis made available two direct to download releases, one of which, &quot;Mr. Grey&quot;, was a single from her forthcoming album, then provisionally known as the &quot;Jazz CD&quot;. She followed this release with an album of children&#x27;s songs titled &quot;Red Frog Presents: 16 Songs for Parents and Children&quot; which was released on January 20, 2010, while work on her &quot;Jazz CD&quot; continued. As of late summer 2011, Davis put her jazz album (rechristened as &quot;I Have My Standards&quot;) on hold, but she still plans to release it down the line.

===Current incarnation: The Motels===
At the end of 2012, The Motels opened for The Go-Go&#x27;s at the Hollywood Bowl, their first performance at this venue. Reviews were positive. On her birthday, January 19, 2013, Martha signed with manager Greg Sims of Vesuvio Entertainment. The Motels began 2013 performances on January 25 at the NAMM convention in their &quot;Living Legends&quot; special concert series on the Main Stage. This was the beginning of a new rise in the band&#x27;s popularity and success. A coast-to-coast summer tour ensued, where they performed with acts such as Bow Wow Wow.

During the 2013 tour, the band was listed in flyers and websites as &quot;Martha Davis and the Motels&quot;, with a lineup consisting of Nicholas Johns (bass), Eric Gardner (drums), Clint Walsh (guitar) and Marty Jourard (sax/keyboards). Subsequently, original Motels sax and keyboard player Marty Jourard rejoined the band for many 2014 dates, including a sellout show at the Whisky a Go Go, which was celebrating its 50th anniversary. Jourard continues to be a permanent fixture today. The Whisky a Go Go concert was recorded with Emmy Award–winning cinematographer Roy H. Wagner and with direction by choreographer Denise Faye, known for her work on &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Burlesque&quot;. 2014 also included an Australian tour and a summer tour with The Go-Go&#x27;s dubbed Replay America. The years 2015 and 2016 saw many more concerts, which included a &quot;Lost 80s Live&quot; tour with bands such as Flock of Seagulls, Berlin, Tommy Tutone, and Wang Chung.

Currently, The Motels, under new management, are touring the U.S. playing new material, along with their vast back catalog. The 27-song collection &quot;If Not Now Then When&quot; was released March 10, 2017, consisting of songs recorded between 2002 and 2006.

In January 2023, a US show was announced: the band will play at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on May 20, 2023.

In 2024, The Motels toured as part of the Abducted by the 80&#x27;s tour across the US and Canada with fellow 80&#x27;s acts Wang Chung, Men Without Hats, and Naked Eyes.

<doc id="933669" wikidata="Q272214" url="?curid=933669" title="Grace Lee Whitney">
<text>Grace Lee Whitney (born Mary Ann Chase; April 1, 1930 – May 1, 2015) was an American actress and singer. Her entertainment career spanned over a half century in a variety of capacities in radio, on stage, in music as a singer and songwriter, in television and in movies. She played Janice Rand on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series and subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; films.

==Early life==
Whitney was born on April 1, 1930, in Ann Arbor, Michigan and was adopted by the Whitney family, who changed her name to Grace Elaine. The family moved to Detroit where Whitney attended school. She started her entertainment career as a &quot;girl singer&quot; on Detroit&#x27;s WJR radio at age 14. After she left home, she began to call herself Lee Whitney, eventually becoming known as Grace Lee Whitney. In her late teens, she moved to Chicago, where she opened in nightclubs for Billie Holiday and Buddy Rich, and toured with the Spike Jones and Fred Waring bands. During this time she trained to be a nurse for a year.

==Early roles==
===Radio===
Whitney was the original Chicken of the Sea mermaid character created in 1952. Chicken of the Sea has maintained the mermaid as its mascot over the years. Whitney came to play the iconic mermaid character while appearing on The Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show on CBS Radio. The show was broadcast in a front of a live studio audience with Whitney in costume and singing the tuna jingle.

===Theater===
Whitney debuted at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in &quot;Top Banana&quot;, with Phil Silvers and Kaye Ballard in 1952, playing Miss Holland. Here she met her future husband, Sydney Stevan Dweck, who was a freelance drummer and percussionist and bandmember for the show. Following the successful run of the show in New York, she joined the cast in Hollywood, where she recreated the role in the 1954 musical film of the same name. 

She was a chorus girl in the off-Broadway musicals &quot;Great to be Alive!&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1956).

In 1960, while in Los Angeles, Whitney auditioned for and was cast in the starring role of Lucy Brown in the first national tour of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, taking over the role from Bea Arthur, who had played the part in New York off-Broadway.

===Film===
Her movie debut was in &quot;House of Wax&quot; (1953) in an uncredited role. Whitney was cast as a member of the all-female band in Billy Wilder&#x27;s comedy &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959). She shared several scenes with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe, including the &quot;upper berth&quot; sequence. She had uncredited roles in &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; (1958), &quot;The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond&quot; (1960), and &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; (1961). Whitney was credited as Tracey Phillips in the drama &quot;A Public Affair&quot; (1962), and as Texas Rose in the Western &quot;The Man from Galveston&quot; (1963). Billy Wilder then gave her the featured role of Kiki the Cossack in &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; (1963).

===Television===
Whitney made more than 100 television appearances following her television dramatic debut in &quot;Cowboy G-Men&quot; in 1953 (credited as Ruth Whitney.) 

She appeared on episodes of &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Islanders&quot;, &quot;Hennesey&quot;, &quot;The Roaring 20s&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Mike Hammer&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, and &quot;The Virginian&quot;.

During the 1950s and early 1960s, Whitney was a frequent semiregular on over 80 live television shows, including &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; hosted by Groucho Marx in 1953, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot;, and &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;, largely appearing in gag sketches. From 1957 to 1958, she appeared as a &quot;Vanna-type adornment&quot; on the popular daytime show &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;.

==&quot;Star Trek&quot;==

Whitney first met &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry when she was cast as the female lead &quot;Sgt. Lilly Monroe&quot; in Roddenberry&#x27;s TV pilot &quot;Police Story&quot; which was filmed just weeks after the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot in 1965. 

Both shows shared many of the same crew including associate producer Robert H. Justman and executive in charge of production Herbert F. Solow and eventual &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star DeForest Kelley. &quot;Police Story&quot; was not picked up but &quot;Star Trek&quot; was. (&quot;Police Story&quot; was later screened as a TV movie in 1967 along with several other failed pilots; by this time &quot;Star Trek&quot; was in its second season. The networks again chose not to pick up the show.)

Roddenberry cast Whitney in &quot;Star Trek&quot; as Yeoman Janice Rand, the personal assistant to Captain James T. Kirk. While the stars of the show were William Shatner (Captain Kirk) and Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spock), Whitney shared the same billing as DeForest Kelley, who played Dr. McCoy. 

On September 1, 1966, one week before the first episode screened on NBC, Whitney, Shatner, and Nimoy were interviewed by Barbara Walters on &quot;The Today Show&quot; where they discussed the new show. The first promotional photographs for &quot;Star Trek&quot; also featured Shatner, Nimoy, and Whitney - separately and together - with pre-production costumes for all, and an early version of the &quot;beehive&quot; hairstyle that Whitney&#x27;s character had in the filmed episodes. 

Whitney appeared in eight of the first 15 episodes, after which she was released from contract. The official reason given for Whitney&#x27;s departure from the show was that her character limited romantic possibilities for Captain Kirk.

At the time Whitney was guaranteed to appear in seven of the first 13 episodes, and contracted for four days work on each. However, she was used for nine additional days. On September 8, 1966, also the date of broadcast of the first episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, Whitney&#x27;s agent was informed that her contract had been terminated, which was around a week prior to the shoot of her penultimate episode, &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;. Roddenberry told Whitney that he did not want to lose Rand as he wanted her relationship with Kirk to continue. In a memo to &quot;Star Trek&quot; showrunner Gene Coon on October 27, 1966, Roddenberry suggested bringing Whitney back as Rand, albeit with a different hairstyle similar to the way she wore it in &quot;Police Story&quot; as this &quot;made her look much younger and softer&quot;, but she was never invited back to the series.

Whitney said that, while still under contract, she was sexually assaulted by an executive associated with the series. Later, in a public interview, she stated that Leonard Nimoy had been her main source of support during that time. She went into more details about the assault in her book &quot;The Longest Trek&quot;, but refused to name the executive, saying in the book, &quot;This is my story, not his.&quot;

==After &quot;Star Trek&quot;==

In between TV guest spots Whitney returned to singing and in 1968 opened her own dress design firm, modeling her own designs while performing. She starred in the 1968 &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; two-part TV episode &quot;Way Down Cellar.&quot; 

After marrying her second husband in 1970 Whitney took a break from acting to work on her singing career while she and her new husband lived at their home in San Fernando Valley raising the children along with four Great Dane dogs. 

It was during this time that Whitney fought an increasing battle with alcoholism, triggered, she later said, to having been let go from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. She had been struggling with alcoholism, drugs, and promiscuity since she was a teenager (although she claimed never to have been drunk on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; set) but it was not until after she left the show that her addictions spiraled. In a 2011 interview with StarTrek.com, Whitney recounted her battle with alcohol and drug abuse during the 1970s and the courage and strength she displayed to eventually overcome those addictions.

&quot;... And I just about killed myself over that reject [being fired from &quot;Star Trek&quot;.] And when I would go on interviews, I would smell of alcohol. I was very Lindsay Lohan-ish, very Charlie Sheen. I was lost. I was lost and I began to bottom out. It took me about 10 years after getting written out to come to my senses, when I bottomed out.&quot; 

In Part 1 of the same 2011 interview Whitney provided some subsequent clarity and context as to her firing from the show where she said:

&quot;...Well, I had the sexual assault from someone at Desilu, which I found out later was done by a lot of producers (during that era). It was before the sexual assault law came into being. I was one of the ones that was a victim. I was fired from the show, but I found later that it was in the works before the assault. I’d been blaming the assault for most of my life, until about 30 years ago, when I got sober.&quot; 

===Return to &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise===

Whitney returned to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in the mid-1970s after DeForest Kelley saw Whitney in the unemployment line and told her that fans had been asking for her at fan conventions which were starting to become regular and numerous in the United States. She attended her first convention, &quot;Equicon-76&quot;, in 1976 and was warmly received. She went on to attend &quot;Star Trek&quot; and science-fiction fan conventions regularly during the 1970s and 1980s, often performing with her band Star.

In the late 1970s there were talks of &quot;Star Trek&quot; returning as a new television series, as &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;. The new series was officially announced on June 10, 1977. Coincidentally, having read the back cover of Susan Sackett&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Star Trek&quot; book and discovering that one of the frequently asked questions sent into the production team was &quot;Whatever happened to Grace Lee Whitney?&quot;, Whitney herself got in touch with Sackett and was invited along to meet with Roddenberry at his office in Paramount Studios. Having not seen her in over 10 years, he was excited and happy to see her and immediately offered to bring back the Rand character for &quot;Phase II&quot;, describing the removal of Rand from &quot;The Original Series&quot; as his greatest mistake and blaming it on NBC executives.

Despite considerable development, Paramount Pictures changed their minds about the TV series and instead decided on &quot;Star Trek&quot; returning as a motion picture. &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; began filming in August 1978 and was released in 1979. Whitney reprised her role as Janice Rand, with a promotion to chief petty officer and in the position of Transporter Chief. 

She also made Cameo appearances in subsequent films, &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986). In &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991), she was cast as the Communications Officer of the USS Excelsior with another promotion, as Lieutenant Commander Janice Rand.

Five years later, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise, she returned in the 1996 &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Flashback&quot;, along with George Takei.

As well as these canonical appearances, Whitney reprised her role in two fan fiction &quot;Star Trek&quot; productions: &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;. &quot;New Voyages&quot; premiered on August 24, 2007, while &quot;Of Gods and Men&quot; made its debut in late 2007. The latter was her final screen appearance as a &quot;Star Trek&quot; character. The fifth episode of fan-produced &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot;, episode &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; (released September 26, 2015), was dedicated to her &quot;lovely and endearing spirit&quot;.

In 2009, Whitney appeared in the British Channel 4 TV film &quot;Bring Back... Star Trek&quot; with Justin Lee Collins. 

Her final screen appearance was in the William Shatner documentary &quot;The Captains&quot; in 2011.

==Later TV roles==
Whitney&#x27;s roles in the 1970s included &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;The Next Step Beyond&quot;, and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;. In 1983, she had a small part in the television film &quot;The Kid with the 200 I.Q.&quot;, with Gary Coleman. Her last TV guest appearance was in a 1998 episode of &quot;&quot;, which reunited her with her &quot;Star Trek&quot; colleagues George Takei, Walter Koenig, and Majel Barrett.

In the 1960s and 1970s, she sang with a number of orchestras and bands, including the Keith Williams Orchestra. Later, she concentrated on jazz/pop vocalizing while fronting for the band Star. With acting taking a back step in the mid 1970s, she performed with her band at Disneyland, bar mitvahs, private parties, political events, schools, and at Sci Fi conventions throughout the remainder of the 1970s, while raising her children.

In the mid-1970s she wrote a number of &quot;Star Trek&quot;-related songs with her second husband, Jack Dale. A 45-rpm record was released in 1976, on her own label, with the songs &quot;Disco Trekin’&quot; (A side) and &quot;Star Child&quot; (B side). 

She recorded such tunes as &quot;Charlie X&quot;, &quot;Miri&quot;, &quot;Enemy Within&quot;, and &quot;USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;&quot;. Many of these songs were released in the 1990s on cassette tape: &quot;Light at the End of the Tunnel&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Yeoman Rand Sings!&quot; in 1999.

==Autobiography==
Whitney&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy&quot;, was released in 1998 (). Along with her hiring and firing from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the book recounts her work as the first Chicken of the Sea mermaid and her struggles with and eventual recovery from alcohol and substance abuse.

==Personal life and death==
Whitney and her first husband, Stephen Dweck, had two sons: Scott and Jonathan Dweck. She divorced her first husband in 1966 and married her second husband, Jack Dale, in 1970. In her autobiography she claimed she had relationships with Buzz Aldrin and Harlan Ellison while still legally married to her second husband. 

Whitney got involved in alcohol, drugs and promiscuous behavior from the age of 13 and struggled with these addictions throughout her career and life. During the filming of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; she attempted to get sober but &quot;switched addictions from booze to marijuana.&quot; After the film was released in 1979, she was so shocked to see how old she looked in the film that she resumed drinking and descended into prostitution and ended up on Skid Row in Los Angeles. By her own words, this was when she &quot;bottomed out.&quot;

And bottoming out means I was sick and tired of being sick and tired and I had to get help. What happened was that I was down on Skid Row, on 6th and Main in L.A., looking for my lower companions to get some kind of help, when I was 12-stepped down there by a man from the Midnight Mission named Clancy, who is a guru in the 12-step program. His sponsee helped me get to my first 12-step meeting where God absolutely delivered me. There was no question. I could not not drink. I was using a lot of drugs from Dr. Feelgood. A lot of actors used the amphetamines from Dr. Feelgood to stay skinny, to function. It&#x27;s just insidious. Once you get into the drinking and using, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get out without the grace of God, which is what I give my credit to. Leonard Nimoy (who is also a recovering alcoholic) was so moved that he (later) wrote the foreword to my book. But that&#x27;s how I began my recovery and my trek back to the studio to make amends, to do everything I&#x27;ve had to do there. With the help of the 12-step program she became sober in 1981. Several years later, following a trip to Israel, Whitney became a born again Christian. 

In a 1995 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; Whitney provided some further insights into her recovery:

I committed my life to Jesus and began to journey back. The high I looked for in drugs and alcohol I eventually found in Jesus Christ...Many people think they can be totally recovered from addictions if they have Jesus Christ. They think that is going to make them new and take away their addictions. I really do not think that is possible. I think God has taken away my alcoholism today. He has taken away my addictions today. But I have to start new every day. I have to start the 12 steps every day. I have to commit my life to him every day.

Whitney dedicated the remainder of her life to helping others overcome addiction and was a leading worker with others in Alcoholics Anonymous. She has spoken in churches, organizations, prisons, and media conventions. After she divorced from her second husband in 1991, she moved to Coarsegold, California in 1993 to be close to Jonathan, also a Christian, and she &quot;continued her fellowship work in Fresno and Madera counties.&quot; 

Whitney died of natural causes at her home in Coarsegold on May 1, 2015, at age 85. 

Jonathan Dweck said his mother wanted to be known more as a survivor of addiction than as a &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast member.

<doc id="933673" wikidata="Q2615915" url="?curid=933673" title="Inner peace">
<text>Inner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a deliberate state of psychological or spiritual calm despite the potential presence of stressors. Being &quot;at peace&quot; is considered by many to be healthy (homeostasis) and the opposite of being stressed or anxious, and is considered to be a state where one&#x27;s mind performs at an optimal level, regardless of outcomes. Peace of mind is thus generally associated with , happiness and contentment.

Peace of mind, , and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as breathing exercises, prayer, meditation, tai chi or yoga, for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself.

Many individuals face challenges in achieving inner spirituality, often due to the demands and stressors of everyday life. These obstacles can make it difficult to find peace and contentment in daily experiences. Spiritual development is generally considered a gradual process, with various practices and approaches aimed at fostering a deeper sense of spirituality over time.

Inner peace can be described as &quot;a low-arousal positive emotional state coupled with a sense of balance or stability.&quot;

Tenzin Gyatso, the current and 14th Dalai Lama, emphasizes the importance of inner peace in the world:

<doc id="933674" wikidata="Q4733507" url="?curid=933674" title="Alma-0">
<text>Alma-0 is a multi-paradigm computer programming language. This language is an augmented version of the imperative Modula-2 language with logic-programming features and convenient backtracking ability. It is small, strongly typed, and combines constraint programming, a limited number of features inspired by logic programming and supports imperative paradigms. The language advocates declarative programming. The designers claim that search-oriented solutions built with it are substantially simpler than their counterparts written in purely imperative or logic programming style. Alma-0 provides natural, high-level constructs for building search trees.

==Overview==
Since the designers of Alma-0 wanted to create a distinct and substantially simpler proposal than prior attempts to integrate declarative programming constructs (such as automatic backtracking) into imperative programming, the design of Alma-0 was guided by four principles:
* The logic-based extension should be &quot;downward&quot; compatible with the underlying imperative programming language
* The logic-based extension should be &quot;upward&quot; compatible with a future extension that will support constraint programming
* The constructs that will implement the extension should support and encourage declarative programming
* The extension should be kept small: nine new features have been proposed and implemented

Alma-0 can be viewed not only as a specific and concrete programming language proposal, but also as an example of a &quot;generic method&quot; for extending any imperative programming language with features that support declarative programming.

The feasibility of the Alma-0 approach has been demonstrated through a full implementation of the language (including a description of its semantics) for a subset of Modula-2.

==Features==
The implemented features in Alma-0 include:
*Use of boolean expressions as statements and vice versa
*A dual for the codice_1 statement that introduces non-determinism in the form of &quot;choice points&quot; and &quot;backtracking&quot;
*A codice_2 statement that introduces a controlled form of iteration over the backtracking
*Unification which, although limited to the use of equality as assignment, yields a new parameter-passing mechanism.

==Imperative and logic programming modes==
The Alma-0 designers claim that the assignment, which is usually shunned in pure declarative and logic programming, is actually needed in a number of natural situations, including for counting and recording purposes. They also affirm that the means of expression of such &quot;natural&quot; uses of assignment within the logic programming paradigm are unnatural.

<text>Pavel Petrovich Chistyakov (; 5 July 1832 — 11 November 1919) was a Russian painter and art teacher. He is known for historical and genre scenes as well as portraits.

== Biography ==
His father was a freed serf who had worked as an estate manager. Despite the financial burdens, he saw to it that his son had a proper education; first at a parish school in Krasny Kholm, then the secondary school in Bezhetsk.

In 1849, he entered the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he studied with Pyotr Basin and Maxim Vorobiev. From 1854 to 1858, he received two silver medals and one gold, for his depiction of Hermogenes in prison. In 1861, he graduated with the title of &quot;Artist&quot;, another gold medal (for his painting of Sophia of Lithuania at the wedding of her son, Vasily II) and the right to a stipend for study abroad. Before leaving, he taught for a short time at a preparatory school in Saint Petersburg.

In 1862, he headed for Germany, followed by lengthy visits to Paris and Rome. Upon returning in 1870, he was awarded the title of &quot;Academician&quot; for several works he had sent home.

After this time, he devoted himself primarily to teaching, first at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, then the academy, where he developed his own teaching methods which merged direct observation with scientific study. He rarely exhibited. His few works were mostly of an historical nature, which he attempted to infuse with a psychological depth, rather than merely representing the events.

He became an associate professor at the academy in 1872 and, following the reorganization of 1892, became a member of the academic council. From 1890 to 1912, he served as head of the Department of Mosaics and oversaw several mosaic projects; notably at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral.

His wife Vera, daughter of the landscape painter Yegor Meyer, was also an artist of some note. The street where he lived was named in his honor and, in 1987, his home in Pushkin (a suburb of Saint Petersburg) became a museum.

<doc id="933684" wikidata="Q1021775" url="?curid=933684" title="Viti, Kosovo">
<text>Viti () or Vitina () is a town and municipality located in the District of Gjilan in Kosovo. According to the 2011 census, the town of Viti has 4,924 inhabitants, while the municipality has 46,987 inhabitants.

== Geography ==
The town of Viti and the southern part of the Municipality lies on the foothills of the Skopska Crna Gora Mountains.

== History ==

===Ottoman period===
The municipality has several settlements historically inhabited by the Laramans, crypto-Catholics.

===Kosovo War and aftermath===
During the Kosovo War 16 KLA soldiers, as well as 5 Serb soldiers and policemen were killed in Viti. The entire fighting happened in 1999 and in the southern part of the municipality, near the Karadak Mountains, in villages such as Lubishtë, Gjylekare, Mogillë, Smirë, Kabash and Dëbëlldeh.

During and after the Kosovo War 76 civilians were killed, 38 Albanians and 38 Serbs.

Following the 1999 Kosovo War, it was the home of A Company, 2/505 Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, the first KFOR troops to begin stabilization efforts in the municipality. After the initial unit left, Viti was the site of a subsequent international scandal when a Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, from A company, 3/504 Parachute Infantry Regiment raped and killed a local girl. The subsequent investigation uncovered serious training and leadership deficiencies in the 3/504 Parachute Infantry Regiment, and catalysed a tremendous change in the training of units deploying for peacekeeping operations. The Church of the Holy Mother of God, Podgorce was looted during the conflict.

During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the Orthodox cemetery in Viti and the village of Dobreš were hit by missiles.

In August 2003, explosive devices planted in Klokot destroyed five Serb houses, with several injuries, including two American KFOR soldiers.

Serbian Orthodox cemeteries have been destroyed in Viti, among other towns, and in 2004 during unrest, nuns of the Binča monastery were physically attacked, by ethnic Albanians.

=== Insurgency in the Preševo Valley ===
During the Insurgency in the Preševo Valley, the UÇPMB mostly recruited fighters from the Karadak region of Kosovo, specifically in the town of Vitia. In February 2001, many towns and villages in the region were covered with posters that instructed Albanians between the ages of 18 and 48 to join their fellow Albanians in the UÇPMB. These posters were supposedly issued by the previously disbanded KLA.

=== Insurgency in Macedonia ===
Amidst the Insurgency in Macedonia, approximately 300 NLA fighters from the Vitia municipality, mostly recruited in Dëbëlldeh and Mjakë, participated in several battles against Macedonian security forces in Tanuševci. The NLA also used Dëbëlldeh and Mjakë as strongholds, where they would store Arms.

===Contemporary===

In 2013 in response to a KLA monument being removed by Serbian authorities in Preševo, a Kosovo Albanian crowd in Viti demolished a Yugoslav-era memorial for anti-fascist Partisans that were killed during the Second World War.

<doc id="933689" wikidata="Q4633297" url="?curid=933689" title="2 Bad Mice">
<text>Formed in 1991, 2 Bad Mice are an English breakbeat hardcore group, composed of Sean O&#x27;Keeffe, Simon Colebrooke, and Rob Playford who was originally the third member and the owner of the Moving Shadow record label. In the 1990s, the group had two singles that charted in the UK.

== History ==
O&#x27;Keefe and Colebrooke first experimented with music in 1990, using equipment and spare time at Playford&#x27;s home studio. The trio formed 2 Bad Mice in 1991. Their first chart success was &quot;Hold It Down&quot; which reached number 48 in February 1992.

2 Bad Mice stopped producing as the hardcore scene began to wane. A best-of compilation of the group&#x27;s work appeared on the American Sm:)e Communications label in 1995.

=== Post split ===
In September 1996, &quot;Bombscare&quot; which reached number 46 in the UK charts.

A new label was created in 1996 called Moshed (MOving Shadow HousE Dept). It was set up with the help of Terry Donavan (A&amp;R at Arista Records, who went on to co-found Rockstar Games). This label, released new mixes of &quot;Bombscare&quot; by Tall Paul, DJ Sneak, and Graham Gold, along with the original and Parliament Squares versions. 

In 1997, the song &quot;Waremouse&quot; appeared in the movie &quot;The Jackal&quot; in the scene where Bruce Willis kissed a man in a gay nightclub.

Playford continues to record as under the alias Timecode, while O&#x27;Keeffe records under the name Deep Blue and as a member of Black Rain.

The members of 2 Bad Mice are also members of Kaotic Chemistry.

In 2020 2 Bad Mice set up a new label Over/Shadow which incorporates the original Moving Shadow Artists with new talent. www.over-shadow.co.uk

== Musical style ==
2 Bad Mice are credited as among the first UK hardcore acts to begin incorporating breakbeats into their style. They were part of the early to mid-1990s hardcore scene, and were instrumental in the music&#x27;s steady mutation into jungle/drum and bass.

<doc id="933691" wikidata="Q1921553" url="?curid=933691" title="Mercury Milan">
<text>The Mercury Milan is a mid-size car manufactured by Ford and marketed by its Mercury division of Ford Motor Company — as a rebadged variant of the Ford Fusion. Named after Milan, Italy, Mercury marketed the Milan for model years 2006-2011 in a single generation. The smaller of two model lines developed to replace the Mercury Sable, it indirectly succeeded the Mercury Mystique as the smallest Mercury sedan.

Presented at the 2005 Chicago Auto Show, the Milan was the first new Mercury sedan nameplate introduced since 1995, and became the final nameplate introduced by the division. Coinciding with Mercury&#x27;s 2010 discontinuation, Milan sales ended after a shortened 2011 model year; the final vehicle was manufactured on December 17, 2010. The Milan was marketed in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), Mexico, and the Middle East.

Throughout its production, the Milan was produced alongside the Ford Fusion at Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.

== Model overview ==
As the entry-level Mercury sedan, the Milan was marketed below the full-sized Mercury Montego and Mercury Grand Marquis. As a rebadged counterpart to the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ (introduced as the Lincoln Zephyr), Mercury marketed the Milan as the smaller of two sedans replacing the Sable, along with the larger Montego. 

=== Chassis ===
The Milan used the Ford CD3 platform; a variant of the Mazda GG platform shared with the first-generation Ford Fusion, Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ, Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX. Using a steel unibody, the CD3 platform is equipped with front-wheel drive. In 2007, all-wheel drive became optional on V6-equipped models. In front, the chassis uses a short-long arm (SLA) double wishbone front suspension and an independent multi-link twist blade rear suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars.

==== Powertrain ====
During its production, the Mercury Milan shared its powertrain with the Ford Fusion. From 2006 to 2009, a 160 hp, 2.3 L, inline-four was standard, replaced by a 175 hp, 2.5 L, inline-four for 2010. A 221 hp, 3.0 L V6 was optional, with output increased to 240 hp in 2010. The Milan did not receive a counterpart of the Ford Fusion Sport, powered by a 3.5 L V6.

The four-cylinder engine was equipped with a five-speed manual transmission as standard (the first manual-transmission Mercury sedan since the 2000 Mystique), with a five-speed automatic as an option. Through its entire production, the V6 was offered solely with a six-speed automatic transmission (shared with the Fusion and Montego). For 2010, the four-cylinder engines were updated with six-speed manual and six-speed automatic transmissions; the six-speed automatic on V6 engines was equipped for manually controlled shifting (&quot;Select Shift&quot;). 
=== Body ===
As a rebadged variant of the Ford Fusion, the Milan featured its own front and rear fascias, along with a waterfall-style grille recalling the Monterey and Montego — as well as projector headlamps, LED taillamps (extending into the trunklid), a bumper-mounted license plate and faux matte-silver or imitation wood trim

2007 changes included &quot;MILAN&quot; badging to the front doors and revised interior panels providing improved side-impact protection along with an improvement in safety ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. As a running change, a DVD-based navigation system became optional along with a console-mounted MP3 auxiliary jack.

Presented at the 2008 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Milan received mid-cycle revisions for the 2010 model year alongside the Fusion and MKZ, including a revised tail lamps and an enlarged grille, reshaped headlamps and revised front fascia. The interior received a revised instrument panel. While not the first hybrid offered by Mercury, the 2010 Milan Hybrid marked the first Mercury hybrid offered as a sedan. 

=== Trim ===
During its production, the Mercury Milan was marketed in six different trim levels, dependent on drivetrain configuration selected by the owner. The base trim levels were &quot;I4&quot; and &quot;V6&quot;; top trim were &quot;I4 Premier&quot; and &quot;V6 Premier&quot;; &quot;V6 AWD&quot; or &quot;V6 Premier AWD&quot;.

For 2009, a VOGA special-edition option package was introduced with specific white leather seats and chrome wheels.

===Safety===
Tests on the 2010 Mercury Milan were conducted by NCAP (New Car Assessment Program).

==Mercury Milan Hybrid==

In March 2009, the 2010 Mercury Milan Hybrid was introduced with the Ford Fusion Hybrid to the US market. The powertrain consists of a 156 hp Atkinson-cycle variant of the Duratec 25 gasoline engine, 106-horsepower AC synchronous electric motor, and an Aisin-produced continuously variable transmission. When driving on electric-only mode (EV mode) the Fusion can achieve 47 mph and up to 2 miles of continuous EV driving. In city driving a full tank of fuel delivers . U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ratings for the Mercury Milan and Ford Fusion hybrid versions are for city and for highway.

Ford set a modest sales target of about 25,000 vehicles a year for the Fusion and Milan hybrids. In total, 2,884 Mercury Milan Hybrids were sold.

<text>The Valmet L-70 &quot;Vinka&quot; is a Finnish-designed piston-powered military basic trainer aircraft of the 1970s. A production run of 30 aircraft were built for the Finnish Air Force in the early 1980s, and although the type was not exported, it formed the basis of the turboprop-powered Aermacchi M-290 RediGO.

==Development and design==
The Finnish state-owned manufacturing conglomerate Valmet Oy began design work in September 1970 on a replacement for the Saab Safirs then in use with the Finnish Air Force as basic trainers. Valmet received an order from the Finnish Air Force for further development of the &quot;LEKO-70&quot; (&quot;Lentokone&quot; (Aeroplane) 1970) in March 1973. The first prototype made its maiden flight from Halli Airport for the first time on 1 July 1975.
The aircraft is a low-winged tractor monoplane of all-metal construction and with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage. It is powered by a single 200 hp (149 kW) Lycoming O-360 flat-four piston engine driving a two-bladed propeller. In its main training role, the pupil and instructor sit side by side under a large sliding canopy. An additional two seats or a stretcher and medical attendant can be carried for the liaison role, while the wings are fitted with four hardpoints for carrying of external stores.

The Finnish Air Force placed an order for 30 aircraft, to be designated &quot;Vinka&quot; (Blast (of wind)) on 28 January 1977, with the aircraft to be built at Valmet&#x27;s Kuorevesi plant.

==Operational history==
The Vinka entered service on 13 October 1980 with deliveries continuing until 1982. Finnish Air Force pilot trainees flew about 100 hours on the Vinka at the Air Academy at Kauhava before converting to the British Aerospace Hawk jet trainer.

Valmet attempted to market the type internationally under the name L-70 Miltrainer, but no orders followed.

On 1 September 2022 the Vinka was removed from Air Force service after over 40 years of service, being replaced by 28 ex-RAF Grob G 115Es.

==L-80 TP Turbo Vinha==
After unsuccessfully having tried to market the L-70 Vinka for the export market, Valmet developed a turboprop version with a new wing and a retractable undercarriage. This aircraft was given the designation L-80 TP Turbotrainer. The prototype (OH-VBB), powered by a 360 shp (268 kW) Allison 250 turboprop engine, made its first flight on 12 February 1985, piloted by Paavo Janhunen. The prototype was destroyed in an accident on 24 April that year, killing the pilot Paavo Janhunen and the flight observer. The second prototype was baptized Valmet L-90 TP and it was used for the development of the L-90 Redigo or RediGo (Both spelling versions are found in the brochures from the manufacturer).

==Operators==
; : Finnish Air Force - 30 were built for the FiAF, serving with the Air Force Academy at Tikkakoski. The final Vinka was retired on 1 September 2022.

<text>The government of Pasqual Maragall was formed on 22 December 2003 following the latter&#x27;s election as President of the Government of Catalonia by the Parliament of Catalonia on 16 December and his swearing-in on 18 December, as a result of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens–United and Alternative Left (ICV–EUiA) being able to muster a majority of seats in the Parliament following the 2003 Catalan regional election. It succeeded the sixth Pujol government and was the Government of Catalonia from 22 December 2003 to 29 November 2006, a total of days, or .

Until 2006, the cabinet comprised members of PSC, ERC and ICV–EUiA, as well as a number of independents proposed by the first two parties. On 12 May 2006, Maragall expelled ERC from the government following its opposition to the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia in the voting held in the Cortes Generales on 30 March and 10 May, and ahead of the 18 June referendum. It was automatically dismissed on 2 November 2006 as a consequence of the 2006 regional election, but remained in acting capacity until the next government was sworn in.

==Investiture==

==Cabinet changes==
Maragall&#x27;s government saw a number of cabinet changes during its tenure:
*On 31 December 2003, the Department of Governance and Public Administration was rebranded as the Department of Governance and Public Administrations.
*On 27 January 2004, Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira announced his resignation as first minister after it was unveiled that he held a meeting with the terrorist organization ETA while being in office, though he remained in the cabinet as minister without portfolio until 4 February. Three weeks later, on 20 February, it was announced that Teaching minister Josep Bargalló would become new first minister, with his former post being occupied by Marta Cid.
*On 28 May 2004, the departments of Teaching and Health and Social Security were rebranded as the Education and Health departments, respectively.
*On 16 October 2004, the Trade, Tourism and Consumer Affairs minister Pere Esteve resigned because of a worsening in his health condition—he had lung cancer—and was replaced in his post by Josep Huguet. Esteve died in June 2005.
*On 21 April 2006, Maragall agreed with his coalition partners the first major reshuffle of his cabinet: the PSC replaced the officeholders of the Culture (Caterina Mieras by Ferran Mascarell), Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (Antoni Siurana by Jordi William Carnes) and Labour and Industry (Josep Maria Rañé by Jordi Valls) ministries; ERC had Xavier Vendrell and Manuel Balcells replacing Joan Carretero and Carles Solà at the helm of the Governance and Public Administrations and Universities, Research and Information Society departments, respectively; and Francesc Baltasar became the new ICV minister of Environment and Housing in place of Salvador Milà.
*On 11 May 2006, Maragall expelled all ERC ministers from the government, effective the next day, following the party&#x27;s opposition to the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which had been voted in the Cortes Generales on 30 March and 10 May, and ahead of the 18 June referendum. The ordinary discharge of duties from ERC-held departments were temporarily re-assigned to PSC ministers until a reorganization took place on 15 May: Xavier Sabaté became new minister of Governance and Public Administrations, Joan Manuel del Pozo was appointed at the helm of the newly-restructured Education and Universities department, whereas Carme Figueras was put in charge of the Welfare and Family Affairs portfolio; the Trade, Tourism and Consumer Affairs and the Universities, Research and Information Society departments were disestablished, their competences transferred to the Economy and Finance and Education and Universities ministries, respectively.

==Executive Council==
The Executive Council was structured into the offices for the president, 16 ministries and the post of the spokesperson of the Government.

<text>Chuseok (; , ), also known as Hangawi (; ; from Old Korean, &quot;the great middle [of autumn]&quot;), is a major mid-autumn harvest festival and a three-day holiday in South Korea celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunisolar calendar on the full moon. In North Korea, they only celebrate for the day of chuseok. Like many other harvest festivals around the world, it is held around the autumn equinox, i.e. at the very end of summer or in early autumn. It is the biggest traditional holiday in South Korea. 
As a celebration of the good harvest, Koreans visit their ancestral hometowns and share a feast of Korean traditional food such as &quot;songpyeon&quot;, &quot;yakgwa&quot;, fruits like Asian pear and &quot;hallabong&quot;, and rice wines such as &quot;sindoju&quot; (). and &quot;dongdongju&quot;. There are two major traditions related to Chuseok: Charye (, ancestor memorial services at home, also known as Jesa), and Seongmyo (, family visit to the ancestral graves), which is usually accompanied by Beolcho (, tidying graves, removing weeds around them). Another major custom is to prepare the family&#x27;s ancestors their favorite meals as an offering.

==Origins==
According to popular belief, Chuseok originates from &quot;gabae &quot;(). &quot;Gabae&quot; started during the reign of the third king of the kingdom of Silla (57 BC – AD 935), when it was a month-long weaving contest between two teams. On the day of &quot;Gabae&quot;, the team that had woven more cloth won and would be treated to a feast by the losing team. It is believed that weaving competitions, archery competitions, and martial arts demonstrations were held as part of the festivities.

Many scholars also believe Chuseok may originate from ancient shamanistic celebrations of the harvest moon. New harvests are offered to local deities and ancestors, which means Chuseok may have originated as a worship ritual. In some areas, if there is no harvest, worship rituals are postponed, or in areas with no annual harvest, Chuseok is not celebrated.

==Traditional customs==
In contemporary South Korea, on Chuseok, masses of people travel from large cities to their hometowns to pay respect to the spirits of their ancestors. Chuseok celebrates the bountiful harvest and strives for the next year to be better than the last. People perform ancestral worship rituals early in the morning. Then, they visit the tombs of their immediate ancestors to trim plants, clean the area around the tomb, and offer food, drink, and crops to their ancestors. The rest of the day is spent playing folk games and bonding with the family members. Harvest crops are attributed to the blessing of ancestors. Chuseok is commonly incorrectly translated as &quot;Korean Thanksgiving&quot; in American English despite the holidays being vastly different in origin and celebration. Although most South Koreans visit their families and ancestral homes, there are festivities held at the National Folk Museum of Korea. Many places are closed during this national holiday, including banks, schools, post offices, governmental departments, and stores. Airline tickets to South Korea around the festival are usually sold out three months in advance and roads and hotels are overcrowded.

===&quot;Charye&quot;===
&quot;Charye&quot; is one of the ancestral memorial rites celebrated during Chuseok, symbolizing the abundance of the harvest season and honoring ancestors and past generations. The rite involves the gathering of families in holding a memorial service for their ancestors through the harvesting, preparation and presentation of special foods as offerings. Preparation for the food usually takes hours and many families start the cooking process early in the morning. The rite embodies the traditional view of spiritual life beyond physical death, respecting the spirits of the afterlife that now also serve to protect their descendants. The foods offered vary across provinces depending on what is available, but commonly feature freshly harvested rice, rice cakes &quot;(songpyeon)&quot; and fresh meat, fruit and vegetables. The arrangement of the foods of &quot;Charye&quot; on the table is also notable: traditionally rice and soup are placed on the north and fruits and vegetables are placed on the south; meat dishes are served on the west and in the middle, and rice cake and some drinks such as &quot;makgeolli&quot; or &quot;soju&quot; are placed on the east. These details can vary across regions.

===&quot;Hanbok&quot;===
The &quot;hanbok&quot; (in South Korea) or &quot;Choson-ot&quot; (in North Korea) is the traditional dress that the Korean people wear on special holidays and formal and semi-formal occasions, such as Chuseok, Lunar New Year, and weddings. The term &quot;hanbok&quot; literally means &quot;Korean clothing.&quot; The basic structure of the hanbok consists of the jeogori jacket, baji pants, chima skirt, and the po coat. The design of the hanbok remains unchanged to this day and is designed in a variety of colors.

===Food===

====&quot;Songpyeon&quot;====
One of the major foods prepared and eaten during the &quot;Chuseok holiday&quot; is &quot;songpyeon&quot; (), a Korean traditional rice cake made with ingredients such as sesame seeds, black beans, mung beans, cinnamon, pine nut, walnut, chestnut, jujube, and honey.
When making &quot;songpyeon&quot;, steaming them over a layer of pine-needles is critical. The word &quot;song&quot; in &quot;songpyeon&quot; means a pine tree in Korean. The pine needles not only contribute to &quot;songpyeon&#x27;s&quot; aromatic fragrance, but also its beauty and taste.

&quot;Songpyeon&quot; is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. However, some &quot;songpyeon&quot; are shaped like a ball. &quot;Songpyeon&#x27;s&quot; rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. Since the Three Kingdoms era in Korean history, a Korean legend stated that these two shapes ruled the destinies of the two greatest rival kingdoms, Baekje and Silla. During the era of King Uija of Baekje, an encrypted phrase, &quot;Baekje is full-moon and Silla is half-moon&quot; was found on a turtle&#x27;s back and it predicted the fall of the Baekje and the rise of the Silla. The prophecy came true when Silla defeated Baekje. Ever since Koreans have believed a half-moon shape is an indicator of a bright future or victory. Therefore, during Chuseok, families gather together and eat half-moon-shaped &quot;Songpyeon&quot; under the full moon, wishing for a brighter future. There&#x27;s a belief that if a single woman makes a pretty &quot;songpyeon&quot;, she will find a great husband, and if a pregnant woman makes a pretty &quot;songpyeon&quot;, she will have a pretty daughter.

====&quot;Hangwa&quot;====
Another popular Korean traditional food that people eat during Chuseok is &quot;hangwa&quot;. It is a general term to categorize sweet foods made with &quot;tteok&quot;, meaning rice cake. It is an artistic food decorated with natural colors and textured with patterns. &quot;Hangwa,&quot; also known as &quot;Hang,&quot; is made with rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavours, and tastes. Because of its decoration and nutrition, Koreans eat &quot;hang&quot; not only during Chuseok, but also for special events, for instance, weddings, birthday parties, and marriages.

The most famous types of &quot;hangwa&quot; are &quot;yakgwa, yugwa&quot;, and &quot;dasik&quot;. &quot;Yakgwa&quot; is a sweet honey cookie which is made of fried rice flour dough ball and &quot;yugwa&quot; is a fried cookie consisting of glutinous rice mixed with honey water, and &quot;cheongju&quot; (rice wine). &quot;Dasik&quot; is a tea cake that people enjoy with tea.

====&quot;Baekju&quot;====
A major element of Chuseok is alcoholic drinks. Liquor drunk on Chuseok is called baekju (백주, 白酒, literally &quot;white wine&quot;) and nicknamed sindoju (신도주, 新稻酒, literally &quot;new rice liquor&quot;) as it is made of freshly harvested rice.

Kooksoondang, a maker of Korean traditional liquors, restored &quot;Yihwaju&quot;, rice wine from the Goryeo era (918–1392), and &quot;Songjeolju&quot; that has been widely enjoyed by Joseon (1392–1910) aristocrats. Its &quot;Jamyang Baekseju&quot; package comprises a variety of liquors ― Jayang Baekseju, Jang Baekseju, Baekokju ― that are claimed to enhance men&#x27;s stamina.

Adults say that if you drink the alcoholic beverage which the ancestors have drunk; there will be nothing you&#x27;ll be scared of.

====Others====
Other foods commonly prepared are &quot;japchae&quot;, &quot;bulgogi&quot;, an assortment of Korean pancakes also known as &quot;jeon&quot;, &quot;saengseon&quot; (fish), and fruits.

===Gifts===
====History of Chuseok gifts====

The Korean people started sharing daily necessities, such as sugar, soap or condiments, as Chuseok gifts in the 1960s. The gifts have changed since the Korean economy has developed. In the 1970s, Korean people had more options for Chuseok gifts; examples include cooking oil, toothpaste, instant coffee sets, cosmetics, television and rice cookers. People chose gift sets of fruit, meat and cosmetics in the 1980s. In the 1990s, people used gift vouchers for Chuseok. In the 21st century, more sophisticated gifts, such as sets of sweet desserts, spam, fruits, health supplements, and skincare have become the most popular options for Chuseok gifts.

====Types of Chuseok gifts and prices====
Some extravagant gifts can be purchased: one kilogram of wild pine mushrooms, which are expensive because they cannot be artificially grown, (560,000 won) US$480.27 and red ginseng products (1.98 million won) US$1698.11. However, the most exorbitantly priced gift is six bottles of wine at Lotte Department Store for a staggering (33 million won) US$28,301.89.

Chuseok gift sets are big business in Korea and prices are typically inflated around the holiday.

===Folk games===

A variety of folk games are played on Chuseok to celebrate the coming of autumn and rich harvest. &quot;Sonori&quot; is a folk performance where Village folk dress themselves to resemble a cow or turtle and go from house to house along with a &quot;nongak&quot; band playing &quot;pungmul&quot; music. Other common folk games played on Chuseok are talchum (mask dance), board game called &quot;Yut Nori&quot;, (also known as &quot;Yunnori, Nyout&quot;, and &quot;Yout&quot;), archery, &quot;ssireum,&quot;(Korean wrestling), and &quot;juldarigi&quot;; folk games vary by region.

====&quot;Ssireum&quot;====
&quot;Ssireum &quot;() is the most popular Korean sport played during Chuseok and contests are usually held during this holiday. Scholars have found evidence for &quot;ssireums&quot; dating back to the Goguryeo dynasty, &quot;Ssireum&quot; is assumed to have 5000 years of history. Two players wrestle each other while holding onto their opponent&#x27;s &quot;satba&quot;, a red and blue band. A player loses when his upper body touches the ground, and the winner becomes &quot;Cheonha Jangsa&quot;, &quot;Baekdu Jangsa&quot;, or &quot;Halla Jangsa&quot;, meaning &quot;the most powerful&quot;. The winner gets a bull and of rice as the prize. Due to its popularity among both the young and the old, &quot;ssireum&quot; contests are held more frequently, not limited to important holidays.

====&quot;Taekkyon&quot;====
&quot; Taekkyon&quot; (or 택견) is one of the oldest traditional martial arts of Korea. Taekkyon was very popular during the Joseon period (1392–1897) where it was practised alongside Ssireum during festivities, including Chuseok. Though originally a hand-to-hand fighting method, plebs used a more tamed version alike to a kicking game. The practitioner uses the momentum of his opponent to knock him down through kicks, swipes and pushes. Tournaments between players from different villages were carried out, starting with the children (&quot;Aegi Taekkyon&quot;) before finishing with the adults.

Taekkyon almost disappeared during the Japanese occupation (1910–1945) but is now considered a cultural heritage of Korea (1983) and a UNESCO intangible cultural item (2011).

====&quot;Ganggangsullae&quot;====
The &quot;Ganggangsullae ()&quot; dance is a traditional folk dance performed under the full moon in the night of Chuseok. Women wear Korean traditional dress, hanbok, make a big circle by holding hands, and sing a song while going around a circle. Its name, &quot;Ganggangsullae&quot;, came from the refrain repeated after each verse, and contains no actual meaning.

For other folk games, they also play Neolttwigi (also known as the Korean plank), a traditional game played on a wooden board.

====&quot;Juldarigi&quot;====
Juldarigi (), or tug-of-war, was enjoyed by an entire village population. Two groups of people are divided into two teams representing the female and male forces of the natural world. The game is considered an agricultural rite to predict the results of the year&#x27;s farming. If the team representing the female concept won, it was thought the harvest that year would be rich.

====Chicken Fight (&quot;Dak SSa Umm&quot;)====
Korean people used to watch chicken fights (), and learned how chickens fought; a game inspired by such was invented.

To play the game, people are separated into two balanced groups. One must bend his or her leg up and hold it bent with the knee poking out. The players must then attack each other with their bent knees, having to eliminate them by making their feet touch the ground; the last player holding up his or her knee wins.

The game is about strength, speed, and balance; to stay alive, one must display the capability of fighting back.

====&quot;Hwatu&quot;====
Hwatu (, also known as &quot;Go-Stop&quot; or &quot;Godori&quot;) is composed of 48 cards including 12 kinds. The rules of the game and the term &quot;water&quot; originated from Tujeon.
It was formerly similar to Hanafuda, but was changed due to similarities with the latter. It went through a course that made it reduced by four base colors and thinner than before, spreading throughout to turn out goods on a mass-produced basis.

==In North Korea==
Since Chuseok is a traditional holiday that has been celebrated long before the division of Korea, people in North Korea also celebrate Chuseok. However, the ideology that divided Korea also caused some differences between the way that the holiday is celebrated in North Korea from the way it is celebrated in South Korea. In fact, North Korea did not celebrate Chuseok and other traditional holidays until the mid-1980s.

While South Koreans celebrate Chuseok by visiting and spending time with family members, most North Koreans do not have any family gatherings for the holiday. Some, especially those in working classes, try to visit their ancestors&#x27; gravesites during Chuseok. However, social and economic issues in North Korea have been preventing visits. In addition, the extremely poor infrastructure of North Korea, especially in terms of public transportation, makes it almost impossible for people to visit grave sites and their families. In contrast to the poor Songbun lower class North Koreans, middle and elite classes enjoy the holiday as they want, easily traveling wherever they want to go.

<text>Queensbridge Houses, also known simply as Queensbridge or QB, is a public housing development in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York City. Owned by the New York City Housing Authority, the development contains 96 buildings and 3,142 units accommodating approximately 7,000 people in two separate complexes (North and South). The complex opened in 1939 and is the largest housing project in North America.

Queensbridge is located in Queens Community District 1, and its ZIP Code is 11101.

==Structures==
Queensbridge, the largest of 26 public housing developments in Queens, is located between Vernon Boulevard, which runs along the East River, and 21st Street. It is immediately south of the Ravenswood power plant and just north of the Queensboro Bridge, for which the complex is named. The complex is the largest housing project in North America. The development is separated into two complexes, the North Houses on 40th Avenue and the South Houses on 41st Avenue. The namesake station of the New York City Subway&#x27;s IND 63rd Street Line () is on the eastern side of the complex on 21st Street.

===Buildings===

The 96-unit, six-story buildings are distinctive due to their shape of two Y&#x27;s connecting at the base. This shape was used as the architects hoped it would give residents more access to privacy and sunlight than the traditional cross-shape. The design was said to be cost-efficient, and they reduced the cost even further by using elevators that only stopped at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th floors. Political pressure to keep costs down was a key reason for the use of cheap designs. W.F.R. Ballard, Henry S. Churchill, Frederick G. Frost, and Burnett Turner designed Queensbridge.

In many aspects, the buildings of Queensbridge are very similar to most government-built housing projects of the era. They are a worn grayish brown which now suffers noticeable deterioration and weathering. Each building is painted red to about four feet up from the ground, giving a united feel to the entire complex as a uniform red &quot;layer&quot; is always close, throughout the complex. On each of the corners in Queensbridge, the New York City Housing Authority has posted signs indicating the project&#x27;s name and management: &quot;Queensbridge North (or South) NYCHA.&quot; These signs come in several varieties depending on their age. The oldest signs, erected in the early nineties, are simply orange and blue, with the newer signs featuring graphics, like those of many other projects.

Access to buildings in the complex is by key or via an intercom system. The halls of Queensbridge&#x27;s buildings are comparable to most municipal buildings, and are dilapidated and lined with worn light blue tiles. Apartments are painted white and are fairly small, even by New York City standards. Elevators have been rebuilt and now stop at floors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and kitchens have been completely renovated and now have frost-free refrigerators. Three thousand bathrooms were renovated with new tubs, toilets, vanities, floor tile and lighting in 2000. This followed a renovation in 1986 when 1,000 of the bathrooms were renovated by Arc Plumbing.

===Amenities===

The original plans included some basic amenities, like a central shopping center, a nursery and six inner courtyards for play. In the 1950s, there were also three playschool rooms, a library, a community center with an auditorium where shows were put on, a gymnasium with a wooden floor that doubled as a wooden-wheels roller skating rink, activity rooms downstairs, and a cafeteria upstairs where the playschool children ate their lunches. Some of the downstairs activities included tap dancing, ballet, art, playing the recorder and singing, pool, knock hockey and table tennis, as well as Girl Scout and Boy Scout meetings. Residents enjoyed concerts during the hot summer months in the square central shopping area, and the Fresh Air Fund sent children on trips out to the Peekskill mountains.

The buildings in the complex are divided by a series of paths and small lawns. Also in the complex are several basketball courts and play areas lined with benches. Across Vernon Boulevard lies Queensbridge Park, the primary place of recreation for tenants of the project. There was also a smaller park placed conveniently right under the Queensboro Bridge called &quot;Baby Park&quot;. Baby Park was closed due to debris falling from the bridge during maintenance work in the late 2000s. Baby Park was replaced by a new playground for the same age range, between 40th-41st Avenues, within Queensbridge Park itself.

==History and crime statistics==
Queensbridge opened in 1939. During the 1950s, the management changed the racial balance of Queensbridge by transferring all families whose income was more than $3,000/year, a majority of whom were White, to middle-income housing projects, and replacing most of these tenants with African-American and Latino families. This policy provided safe and sanitary housing to many low-income African-American and Latino families.

Queensbridge is well known for its contributions to hip hop and rap music, and has been home to some of the most influential musicians in the genre. Marley Marl Williams was the first in a long succession of acclaimed artists from &quot;The Bridge&quot;, which came to be one of the most famous hip hop neighborhoods in the country. Its rappers and producers helped to put it on the map. The Juice Crew collective, hugely influential in the 1980s, featured among its members Queensbridge rappers MC Shan, Roxanne Shanté and Craig G.

While the Boogie Down Productions-MC Shan dispute had already put &quot;The Bridge&quot; on the rap map in the 1980s, the new crop of Queensbridge rappers like Nas and Mobb Deep made frequent references to the Queensbridge Houses that cemented its reputation as a dystopian vision of poverty, drugs, and violence just as New York City&#x27;s problems with crack cocaine and the unprecedented carnage it had brought to places like Queensbridge reached a peak. Nas&#x27; 1994 album &quot;Illmatic&quot;, often regarded as the greatest hip-hop album of all time, concerns his experiences in Queensbridge. Other notable artists associated with the Queensbridge hip hop scene include Blaq Poet, Cormega, Tragedy Khadafi, Nature, Screwball, Capone, and Big Noyd.

Regarding the Queensbridge music scene, &quot;XXL&quot; columnist Brendan Frederick wrote:

By the 1970s, Queensbridge experienced a rise in crime with the rest of the city. During the height of the crack epidemic in 1986, Queensbridge experienced more murders than any NYCHA complex in New York City. However, in the 2000s, crime went down.

For many years Queensbridge has had a problem with drug dealers and drug users. An 11-month police investigation led to the arrest of 37 people during a drug bust in February 2005. Another raid in February 2009, following a seven-month investigation, resulted in 59 arrests.

==Population==
As of 2013, Queensbridge had a total population of 6,105. The racial breakdown was 61.4% black, 2.3% white, 1.9% Asian, 1.0% American Indian and 2.4% multiracial. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 30.1%.

By 2020, the Asian population in Queensbridge rose to 11% of the development&#x27;s total population. This prompted calls for better social services for the community&#x27;s Asian residents.

<doc id="933716" wikidata="Q4992014" url="?curid=933716" title="Must-carry">
<text>In cable television, many governments, including the ones of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, apply a must-carry regulation stating that forces a cable TV provider to carry the public interest programming, like locally licensed television stations, on a provider&#x27;s system. In some countries, this &quot;traditional&quot; approach had been extended to the Internet information sources. Similar approach in other sectors, like telecommunications, is called &quot;universal service&quot;.

== North America ==
=== Canada ===

Under current Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations, the lowest tier of service on all Canadian television providers may not be priced higher than $25 a month, and must include all local Canadian broadcast television channels, local legislative and educational services, and all specialty services that have 9(1)(h) must-carry status. All specialty channels licensed by the CRTC as a mainstream news channel must also be offered by all television providers, although they need not be on the lowest tier of service.

In the mid-to-late 1970s, the CRTC implemented a rule that a cable system must carry a broadcast television station at no cost to the broadcaster if the transmitter emitted an equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of at least 5 watts. This CRTC rule may have changed over the years, but in principle, a broadcast television station transmitting at 1 kilowatt EIRP must be carried. The status of terrestrial &quot;digital only&quot; channels with respect to the must-carry requirement is untested, because, unlike those in the U.S., some television stations in Canada did not operate digital signals until the digital television transition in Canada in August 2011. The digital broadcasters that were active before then were merely high-definition simulcasts of those stations&#x27; existing analog signals in major centres, such as Toronto and Vancouver, with no additional digital subchannels offered. This was because broadcasters declined to carry subchannels, for which CRTC rules required separate licenses.

For many years, the Canadian must-carry rules created very little friction between terrestrial broadcasters and cable systems, as providers are allowed to more aggressively implement other digital telecommunications services (like cable internet services and IP telephony) with less overall regulation than their U.S. counterparts. However, in 2008, Canada&#x27;s two largest commercial television networks, CTV and Global, began to demand that the CRTC permit them to charge a fee for cable carriage, even alleging that some smaller market stations would be forced to cease operations if this was not allowed. The CRTC initially rejected these demands, but later re-opened discussion with Canadian broadcasters to allow charging carriage fees. In 2012, a 5–4 decision from the Supreme Court of Canada ultimately ruled the CRTC did not have the authority to permit broadcasters to charge carriage fees from cable and satellite providers.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates this area of business and public policy pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Part II. These rules were upheld in a 5–4 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1994 in the case &quot;Turner Broadcasting v. FCC&quot; (95-992).

Although cable television service providers routinely carried local affiliates of the major broadcast networks, independent stations and affiliates of minor networks were sometimes not carried, on the premise it would allow cable providers to instead carry non-local programming which they believed would attract more customers to their service.

Many cable operators were also equity owners in these cable channels, especially Tele-Communications Inc., then the nation&#x27;s largest multiple system operator (MSO), and had moved to replace local channels with equity-owned programming (at the time, TCI held a large stake in Discovery Communications). This pressure was especially strong on cable systems with limited bandwidth for channels.

The smaller local broadcasters argued that by hampering their access to this increasing segment of the local television audience, this posed a threat to the viability of free-to-view broadcast television, which they argued was a worthy public good.

Local broadcast stations also argued cable systems were attempting to serve as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; in competing unfairly for advertising revenue. Some affiliates of major networks also feared that non-local affiliates might negotiate to provide television programming to local cable services to expand their advertising market, taking away this audience from local stations, with similar adverse impact on free broadcast television.

Although cable providers argued that such regulation would impose an undue burden on their flexibility in selecting which services would be most appealing to their customers, the current &quot;must-carry&quot; rules were enacted by the United States Congress in 1992 (via the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act), and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the rules in rejecting the arguments of the cable industry and programmers in the majority decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy. That decision also held that MSOs were functioning as a vertically integrated monopoly.

A side effect of the must-carry rules is that a broadcast station cannot charge a cable television provider license fees for the program content retransmitted on the cable network under the rule. But note that must-carry is an option of the station and the station may, in lieu of must-carry, negotiate license fees as part of a retransmission consent agreement.

==== Applicability ====
There are a few exceptions to must-carry, most notably:

* Must-carry is the default assumption even if a station does not make a formal request [see US Code Title 47, Section 76.64(f)3]. 
* Must-carry does not apply if the television station does not want to be carried under the retransmission consent provisions. This applies only to non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. Station operators are allowed to demand payment from cable operators, or negotiate private agreements for carriage, or threaten revocation against the cable operator (see Sinclair, Time Warner Cable). Must-carry is a privilege given to television stations, not a cable company. A cable company cannot use must-carry to demand the right to carry an over-the-air station against the station&#x27;s wishes.
* A station is not entitled to distribution under must-carry legislation until a certain time after it provides usable signal to the headend for the cable or satellite provider; the station must pay the expense of leased lines to reach providers such as Colorado-based Dish Network or California-based DirecTV.
* Foreign signals, such as Windsor, Ontario stations CBET-DT and CICO, or McAllen, Texas&#x27;s former CW affiliate (XHRIO-TV), are not required to be carried, but are often carried on border-area cable systems close to the foreign stations.
* Most low-power broadcast stations are not required to be carried, although often in these cases they are bundled to be carried as part of a retransmission consent agreement with a full-power sister station.

==== Digital must-carry ====
Digital must-carry (also incorrectly called &quot;dual must-carry&quot;) is the requirement that cable companies carry either the analog (over a hybrid analog/digital cable system) or digital (over a digital-only pay television system like AT&amp;T U-verse or Verizon FiOS) signal. They must still meet the every-subscriber/television receiver laws, i.e. &quot;Pursuant to Section 614(b)(7) and 615(h), the operator of a cable system is required to ensure that signals carried in fulfillment of the must-carry requirements are provided to EVERY subscriber of the system&quot;, of local stations. This has been opposed by numerous cable networks, which might be bumped off of digital cable were this to happen, and promoted by television stations and the National Association of Broadcasters, whom it would benefit by passing their high definition or digital multicast signals through to their cable viewers. In June 2006, the FCC was poised to pass new digital must-carry rules, but the item was pulled before a vote actually took place, apparently due to insufficient support for the chairman&#x27;s position.

In September 2007, the Commission approved a regulation that requires cable systems to carry the analog signals if the cable system uses both types of transmission. The FCC left the decision to also retransmit the digital signal up to the cable provider. Digital-only operators are not required to provide an analog signal for their customers (AT&amp;T U-verse, Verizon FiOS). Small cable operators were allowed to request a waiver. The regulation ended three years after the date of the digital television transition (which occurred on June 12, 2009), and applies only to stations not opting for retransmission consent.

Cable operators (analog and digital) that transmit more than 12 channels need only provide a maximum of their total channel size to this must-carry requirement. Thus with about 150 channels available to a 1 GHz operator, they are only required to support up to 50 analog channels (42 for 850 MHz, 36 for 750 MHz). Cable providers that decide to scale back their analog selection merely need provide written notification on their bill (or equivalent) for 30 days prior to their change. Customers already using digital cable set-top boxes will usually be unaffected (if anything after the change, they may get a large number of additional channels because each analog channel can be replaced by 2–36 digital channels). The requirement only applies to must-carry stations; most metro providers carry many more analog stations by choice, not law.

==== Other networks ====
A variation of &quot;must-carry&quot; also applies to DBS services like DirecTV and Dish Network, as first mandated by the Satellite Home Viewer Act. These providers are not required to carry local stations in &quot;every&quot; metropolitan area in which they provide service, but must carry &quot;all&quot; of an area&#x27;s local stations if they carry any at all. Sometimes, these will be placed on spot beams: narrowly directed satellite signals targeted to an area of no more than a few hundred miles diameter, in order to allow the transponder frequencies to be re-used in other markets. In some cases, stations of lower perceived importance are placed on &quot;side satellites&quot; which require a second antenna. This practice has raised some controversy within the industry, leading to the requirement that the satellite provider offer to install any extra dish antenna hardware for free and place a notice to this effect in place of any missing channels.

==== Retransmission consent ====

If a broadcaster elects retransmission consent, there is no obligation for the cable/satellite system to carry the signal. This option allows broadcasters who own stations, including those affiliated with major networks such as CBS, NBC and ABC or Fox to request cash or other compensation from cable/satellite providers for signals. Initially, stations usually attempted to gain further distribution of cable/satellite services and/or co-owned low-power television stations in which they also hold an equity position rather than direct cash compensation, which cable/satellite systems had almost universally balked at paying. However, in the mid 2000s the stations succeeded in earning carriage fees from cable/satellite systems.

In some cases, these channels have been temporarily removed from distribution by systems who felt broadcasters were asking too steep a price for their signal. Examples include the removal of all CBS-owned local stations as well as MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon from Dish Network for two days in 2004, the removal of ABC-owned stations from Time Warner Cable for a little under a day in 2000, and the removal of all Hearst Television local stations from Time Warner for more than a week in 2012.

In August 2013, Time Warner Cable and CBS Corporation reached an impasse in negotiations over retransmission fees, forcing a one-month blackout of CBS-owned broadcast and cable networks similar to the 2004 Dish Network blackout. It was the longest such blackout to date, and has produced calls for Congress to revisit the issue of retransmission consent. TWC had offered affected customers a $20 credit on their bill for the inconvenience, but the blackout caused at least one class-action lawsuit against the cable operator, and others are pending.

In the U.S., retransmission consent has often been chosen over must-carry by the major commercial television networks. Under the present rules, a new agreement is negotiated every three years, and stations must choose must-carry or retransmission consent for each cable system they wish their signal to be carried on. Non-commercial stations (such as local PBS stations) may not seek retransmission consent and may only invoke must-carry status.

=== Mexico ===
Before 2013, no regulation required cable or satellite providers to carry national television networks or, in the case of cable, local stations. Cable providers had to negotiate retransmission consent with Televisa and TV Azteca; often, they were bundled with other pay channels. Local stations had to strike separate agreements. This meant that few providers had all of the local stations available in an area, and availability varied significantly among providers in the same city.

As part of the telecommunications reform of 2013 and the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law (&quot;Ley Federal de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión&quot;) of 2014, new &quot;must-offer, must-carry&quot; laws were introduced:

* Satellite providers were required to carry national networks with a population reach of 50 percent or greater. Originally, four national networks were designated: Las Estrellas, Canal 5, Azteca 7 and Azteca Uno (formerly Azteca Trece). Since then, Azteca multicast channels a+ and ADN40, as well as new network Imagen Televisión, have also reached the coverage threshold.
:* Satellite providers must black out programming on a national network, primarily sporting events, when it is blacked out on the local transmitter in a subscriber&#x27;s area.
* Cable providers are required to carry on their basic tiers the primary program streams of all stations in the area and place them on the lowest channel numbers on the system, corresponding to their virtual channels. Additional subchannels can be carried in appropriate channel ranges for their content.
* All providers must carry a series of channels from &quot;federal public institutions&quot;: Canal Once, Once Niños, Canal Catorce, Canal 22, TV UNAM and Ingenio TV. A separate, pre-existing provision requires carriage of Canal del Congreso.
* All such channels shall be rebroadcast in the highest quality possible.

==== Reactions and conflicts ====

This new law provoked complaints from television companies TV Azteca and Televisa, who argued that the action constituted copyright infringement and sought royalties for the transmission of channels. In addition, Televisa requested a right of &quot;amparo&quot; to declare that the IFT did not have constitutional power to decide on the television channels. This controversy was solved when the President of Mexico announced the filing of a constitutional controversy before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, to reaffirm the regulatory powers of the Institute, giving the agency legal and judicial power to make decisions on the matter.

== Europe ==
===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, all television stations that have a terrestrial licence (analogue or digital) are required to be placed in the lowest (cheapest) offer of all cable, IPTV and satellite companies.

Must-carry regulations apply to:
* All channels of Czech Television - ČT1, ČT2, ČT24 and ČT4 (sport)
* All channels of TV Prima - Prima, Prima Cool and R1 TV
* Two of three channels of TV Nova - Nova and Nova Cinema
* New digital television stations - TV Barrandov and Z1
* Future television stations TV7 (regional news) and RTA (regional television)
* Carriage of TV Pohoda and Febio TV was also mandated by must-carry regulations; however, as investments for these channels were pulled, these channels never commenced broadcasting.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, cable, multichannel multipoint distribution services and satellite providers have Comreg regulated &quot;must-carry&quot; stations. For cable companies, this covers RTÉ One, RTÉ Two, Virgin Media One and TG4.

The same rules apply to digital MMDS systems. Analogue MMDS companies were required to carry only TV3 due to serious bandwidth limitations.

=== Romania ===
One of the most crowded must-carry rules from Europe is the Romanian, which is compulsory only for cable networks and includes 10 public television stations like TVR1, TVR2, TVR Cultural, TVR News, etc., TV5 Monde, 52 private Romanian TVs that do not require subscribers&#x27; tax, and at least two local and/or regional channels available in any area of cable networks operational territory unit. Erdely TV a Hungarian language television licensed in Romania is also compulsory in networks in Transylvania and Banat (western part of Romania close to the border with Hungary) where Hungarian speaking population is above 20% of any city or village. The huge number of private stations is though limited to a maximum of 25% of the total number of channels carried by any network, so the rule is to update every year the list based on audiences in the previous year. The audiovisual authority in Romania, CNA (Consiliul Național al Audiovizualului) publishes every year, at the beginning of February, the updated list.

== Asia ==
=== India ===
The Indian government has applied a must-carry rule for public broadcaster channels from Doordarshan by cable, direct-to-home and IPTV network. Cable television operators must offer DD National, DD News, Lok Sabha TV, Rajya Sabha TV and regional channels to all subscribers. In addition, DD Bharati and DD Urdu must also be carried in their appropriate tiers.

=== Indonesia ===
As stipulated in the Broadcasting Act No. 32 of 2002, all &quot;subscription broadcasting institutions&quot; (pay satellite, cable, and IPTV providers) are required to provide at least 10% of their channel capacity for domestic channels, both public (i.e. TVRI and local public broadcasters) and private broadcasters. Furthermore, according to the act, they also must provide one domestic production-based channel in ten foreign production-based channels, with at least one domestic production-based channel. These rules were rooted from the previous 1997 Broadcasting Act.

Because of the loose regulation, pay television providers are free to determine which network they would carry in their package as long as they reach the 10% minimum. Some providers carrying national private networks (unlike in terrestrial, they excluding local programming) and a number of local stations such as JakTV from Jakarta and JTV from Surabaya, even if the carriage is intended for national subscribers. Some opt to not include several private networks because they do not have an agreement with the respective networks. Also, out of three TVRI national channels and its local stations, only TVRI Nasional is carried by most providers (the exception is Transvision, who also carry TVRI Sport HD in its package). Unlike in terrestrial, the providers neither include local programming from the TVRI Nasional feed like in analog nor carry a dedicated local station&#x27;s channel as in digital.

=== Philippines ===
The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) requires all pay television operators to carry licensed free-to-air stations on all their packages. The rule particularly forbids pay-TV operators from excluding such stations in places which ordinarily cannot receive a decent broadcast signal.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, all terrestrial television channels are required to be carried on satellite and cable television platforms as free-to-air channels and required to be placed on the same EPG number as their terrestrial counterparts. A must-carry rule was applied to the analog terrestrial television channels and was dropped in 2014 when digital terrestrial television channels replaced analog. Thailand&#x27;s National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) said the must-carry rule will be used to guarantee Thais&#x27; basic right to watch free-TV programs via any platform such as terrestrial, cable and satellite receivers.

=== Vietnam ===
The Vietnamese government required 7 must-carry channels to be carried free-to-air on all television platforms such as cable, satellite and the internet. These channels are designed to air news, information and propaganda for the public.

<doc id="933727" wikidata="Q7297425" url="?curid=933727" title="Ray Durham">
<text>Ray Durham (born November 30, 1971) is a former Major League Baseball second baseman. He is a 14-year major league veteran owning a .277 lifetime batting average with 1,249 runs scored, 2,054 hits, 440 doubles, 79 triples, 192 home runs, 875 run batted in (RBIs) and 273 stolen bases in 1,975 career games.

==Personal life==
Durham graduated from Harry P. Harding High School in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1990, where he played baseball and football. While on the football team, he was teammates with future professional wrestler R-Truth. Durham was on the state select baseball team and was an honorable mention All-American in football as a defensive back.

He did not attend college, as he began playing minor league baseball with the Gulf Coast White Sox. Durham was drafted in 5th round by the Chicago White Sox in 1990. Durham retired from Major League Baseball in 2008, and is enjoying retired life with his wife Regina and their three children.

==Major League career==

===Chicago White Sox (1995–2002)===
Durham was a member of the Chicago White Sox from 1995 to 2002. Durham was a leadoff hitter during these years of his career. Durham established himself as one of baseball&#x27;s better leadoff hitters with above league average on-base percentages and averaging well over 20 stolen bases and 10 home runs per season. His performance from 2000 to 2002 was exceptional. By posting at least 15 home runs with 100 runs, 20 steals, a .450 slugging percentage and 65 RBIs in three consecutive seasons, Durham became just the 10th player in baseball history to accomplish such a feat. Durham is in great company, with the list including Hall of Famers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Joe Morgan, as well as Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez. Durham left Chicago as the club&#x27;s all-time leader in leadoff home runs (20), while ranking fifth in steals (219), seventh in doubles (249) and extra base hits (408) and eighth in runs (784).

===Oakland Athletics (2002)===
Durham was traded to the Oakland Athletics before the 2002 baseball trading deadline for right-handed pitcher Jon Adkins. Durham&#x27;s hitting helped push he A&#x27;s into the 2002 playoffs. The Durham deal was a prototypical &quot;rent a player&quot; trade that can occur at the trading deadline. The A&#x27;s, who constantly rank among the bottom teams in baseball in player salaries, made a trade for the short-term playoff push. Durham was a part of the A&#x27;s 20 consecutive game winning streak in 2002. With the A&#x27;s limited finances, it was well known in baseball circles that Durham would most likely re-sign elsewhere.

===San Francisco Giants (2003–2008)===
After the 2002 season, Durham signed a three-year contract worth $20.1 million with the San Francisco Giants with a $7 million player option for a fourth year that was later exercised. The health Durham displayed during the earlier years of his career vanished. Between 1996 and 2002, Durham appeared in at least 150 games each season, but in 2003 he only appeared in 110 games and in 2004 he appeared in 120. Recurring hamstring injuries and other injuries caused Durham to spend time on the disabled list. The injuries also hampered Durham&#x27;s success when he was on the field. Durham&#x27;s running game and stolen bases dropped as Durham tried to protect his hamstrings from reinjury. Despite these injuries, Durham did post solid offensive numbers during his time in the line up.

Because of Durham&#x27;s injuries that limited his speed and the recurring injuries to Giants outfielder Moisés Alou, Durham was given the opportunity to bat fifth in the batting order more often. Durham was batted fifth regularly in 2006. In the 2005–2006 off-season, Durham adopted a new work out and strength conditioning routine. The result was a healthy Durham and perhaps his best offensive year in 2006 when in 137 games he batted .293 with career highs in slugging percentage (.538), home runs (26), RBIs (93).

Durham re-signed with the Giants for a two-year contract worth $14.5 million on December 2, 2006. Giants general manager Brian Sabean lauded Durham for making an impressive transition from a lead off hitter to a middle of the order run producer.

After re-signing with the Giants, Durham struggled in 2007. Durham called the season &quot;embarrassing&quot; and the &quot;worst&quot; of his career. Durham admitted that his defense had suffered because he was thinking about his hitting while on defense. Durham claimed he had trouble adjusting to the new strategy to pitch against him, which included throwing cutters inside and throwing curveballs on the outside corner. Some Giants fans and radio personalities criticized Durham&#x27;s performance in 2006 as being motivated by money because 2006 was Durham&#x27;s contract year. Durham denied these claims and claimed that almost every year is a contract year.

On August 21, 2007, against Sergio Mitre of the Florida Marlins, Durham fouled a pitch at the plate that bounced up and hit his groin. He would go on to single on the next pitch. &quot;I was swinging at the first thing so I could sit down&quot;, Durham said. &quot;Then, I end up with a knock and I had to run from first to third. It did not feel good&quot;.

On June 12, 2008, Durham got his 2000th hit off Colorado Rockies pitcher Greg Reynolds.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2008)===
On July 20, 2008, Durham, was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for minor league pitcher Steve Hammond and minor league outfielder Darren Ford.

Durham filed for free agency on November 1, 2008. He retired after rejecting a minor league deal from the Washington Nationals.

<doc id="933736" wikidata="Q15831" url="?curid=933736" title="Saturn Nebula">
<text>The Saturn Nebula (also known as NGC 7009 or Caldwell 55) is a planetary nebula in the constellation Aquarius. It appears as a greenish-yellowish hue in a small amateur telescope. It was discovered by William Herschel on September 7, 1782, using a telescope of his own design in the garden at his home in Datchet, England, and was one of his earliest discoveries in his sky survey. The nebula was originally a low-mass star that ejected its layers into space, forming the nebula. The central star is now a bright white dwarf star of apparent magnitude 11.5. The Saturn Nebula gets its name from its superficial resemblance to the planet Saturn with its rings nearly edge-on to the observer. It was so named by Lord Rosse in the 1840s, when telescopes had improved to the point that its Saturn-like shape could be discerned. William Henry Smyth said that the Saturn Nebula was one of Struve&#x27;s nine &quot;Rare Celestial Objects&quot;.

The Saturn Nebula is a complex planetary nebula and contains many morphological and kinematic sub-systems in three dimensions. It includes a halo, jet-like streams, multiple shells, ansae (&quot;handles&quot;), and small-scale filaments and knots. The ansae are expanding non-radially from the central star. Although the ansae are most prominent in the Saturn Nebula, they are also visible in other planetary nebulae, including NGC 3242, NGC 6543 and NGC 2371-2.

The distance of the Saturn Nebula is not known precisely. estimates the distance to be 5,200 light-years (1.6 kpc). In 1963 O&#x27;Dell estimated it to be 3,900 light-years (1.2 kpc), which gives an approximate diameter of 0.5 light years for the object as a whole.

The central star, a very hot bluish dwarf with a temperature of 55,000 K, from which the nebula is believed to originate, has an absolute magnitude of +1.5, which equates to a luminosity of about 20 solar luminosities and a visual magnitude of 11.5. This strong ultraviolet irradiation from the central star creates the characteristic fluorescent green tint of the nebula via the radiation of doubly ionized oxygen. The object overall has a visual magnitude of 8 and a radial velocity of 28 miles per second towards the Earth.

The nebula is 1 degree west of the star Nu Aquarii. The central portion measures 25″ × 17″, while the outer shell extends to 41″ × 35″. The object is on many &quot;best of&quot; observing lists.

<doc id="933739" wikidata="Q17141630" url="?curid=933739" title="Southern Bell">
<text>Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company was a Bell Operating Company serving the Southeastern United States of Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It also previously covered the states of Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee until 1968 when those were split off to form South Central Bell. In 1984, it became a subsidiary of BellSouth Corporation in the breakup of the Bell System. 

==History==
The company was originally known as the Atlanta Telephonic Exchange, having been created to service citizens of Atlanta in 1879, before it was renamed in 1882. 
Southern Bell also operated in Charleston and other parts of West Virginia, from 1883 until 1917, when the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia took over operations there.

===Landmark sex discrimination case===
&quot;Weeks v. Southern Bell&quot; was an important sex discrimination case in which Lorena Weeks claimed that Southern Bell had violated her rights under the 1964 Civil Rights Act when they denied her application for promotion to a higher paying position because she was a woman. She was represented in the case by Sylvia Roberts, a National Organization for Women attorney. She lost the initial case but won in 1969 after several appeals. &quot;Weeks v. Southern Bell&quot; was an important case as it marked the first victory in which NOW used the Civil Rights Act to fight sex-based discrimination.

===Reincorporation===
Southern Bell, originally incorporated in New York, was reincorporated in Georgia in 1983 as SBT&amp;T Co. The original Southern Bell was then merged into SBT&amp;T Co., at which point that company was renamed Southern Bell. Since BellSouth, the new owner and board member, Ben Bell of Nashville’s Southern Bell subsidiaries and South Central Bell upon the divestiture of AT&amp;T, was now based in Georgia, it was more practical to have Southern Bell incorporated in the same state. Southern Bell was renamed BellSouth Telecommunications in 1992 when South Central Bell was merged back into it. BellSouth Telecommunications was acquired by the new AT&amp;T (the former SBC Corporation) in 2006 when that company acquired BellSouth Corporation. BellSouth Telecommunications remains the local operating company of AT&amp;T in BellSouth territory, though does business as AT&amp;T Southeast.

Southern Bell was headquartered in what is now the Tower Square building in Atlanta. Most Atlanta operations have now been relocated to AT&amp;T Headquarters in Dallas, Texas. Downtown Atlanta&#x27;s telephone exchange is still located in the Art Deco Southern Bell Telephone Company Building.

<text>Butterfield Overland Mail (officially Overland Mail Company) was a stagecoach service in the United States operating from 1858 to 1861. It carried passengers and U.S. Mail from two eastern termini, Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri, to San Francisco, California. The routes from each eastern terminus met at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and then continued through Indian Territory (Oklahoma), Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Mexico, and California ending in San Francisco. On March 3, 1857, Congress authorized the U.S. postmaster general, at that time Aaron V. Brown, to contract for delivery of the U.S. mail from St. Louis to San Francisco. Prior to this, U.S. Mail bound for the Far West had been delivered by the San Antonio–San Diego Mail Line since June 1857.

The route was designated a national historic trail in 2023.

==Origins==
===John Butterfield: president of Overland Mail Company===
John Butterfield was a descendant of Benjamin Butterfield, who brought his family from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638. His father, Daniel Butterfield, lived at Berne, in the Helderberg, near Albany, N.Y., where John was born. He attended schools near his boyhood home, but his education was meager.

John&#x27;s early involvement with stage lines started about 1820.

&quot;John Butterfield was borne at Berne, in the Helderberg, near Albany, November 18, 1801. In early life we find him in the employment of Thorpe &amp; Sprague, of that city, as a driver, and through the solicitation of Mr. Theodore S. Faxton came to Utica [NY], where he for a time was employed in picking up passengers from the taverns and boats for Parker&#x27;s stages. After a time he started a livery [1827] with but small accommodations… His connection to Parker &amp; Co. continued so long as they were still in business, and was succeeded by lines of his own, wherein he was a leading manager in the State until staging was superseded by railroads.&quot;

After his employment with other stage lines, John decided to use this experience for running his own stage lines in Upstate New York.

&quot;Mr. Butterfield devoted his attention largely to lines running North and South. At the height of stage coaching he had forty lines running from Utica as headquarters to Ogdensburg and Sacketts Harbor on the North, and South to the Pennsylvania line, and through Chemung and Susquehanna valleys.&quot;

By 1857, when John was awarded the Overland Mail Company contract, he had had 37 years of experience working for and running stage lines. This was one of the reasons that Postmaster General A.V. Brown awarded him the contract.

===Awarding the Overland Mail Company contract===

Through the 1840s and 1850s there was a desire for better communication between the east and west coasts of the United States. There were several proposals for railroads connecting the two coasts. A more immediate realization was an overland mail route across the west. Congress authorized the Postmaster General to contract for mail service from Missouri to California to facilitate settlement in the west. The Post Office Department advertised for bids for an overland mail service on April 20, 1857. Bidders were to propose routes from the Mississippi River westward. Nine bids were made by some of the most experienced stage men.

None of the express companies, such as American Express, Adams Express, or Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Express, bid on the contract because, as of yet, they had no experience running stage lines. A suggestion by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the express companies could do a better job than the Overland Mail Company drew a sharp rebuttal from a Washington, D.C., newspaper.

Mail Contract No. 12,578 for $600,000 per annum for a semi-weekly service was assigned to John Butterfield of Utica, New York, who was president for the contract that was named the Overland Mail Company. This was the longest mail contract awarded in the United States. It was a stockholding company and the main stockholders, besides John Butterfield, were also fellow directors of the company: William B. Dinsmore of New York City; William G. Fargo of Buffalo, New York; James V.P. Gardner of Utica, New York; Marquis L. Kenyon of Rome, New York; Alexander Holland of New York City; and Hamilton Spencer of Bloomington, Illinois. There were four others known as &quot;sureties&quot; (security against loss).

Almost all of the stockholders were connected to other businesses in Upstate New York and most lived near Butterfield&#x27;s home in Utica, New York. Alexander Holland was Butterfield&#x27;s son-in-law and treasurer of the Overland Mail Company. Dinsmore was vice-president of the company. The office for the company was in New York City.

Why John Butterfield was chosen was stated by Postmaster General Aaron Brown:

... a route which no contractor had bid for, but one which in the judgement of A.V. Brown, of Memphis, &quot;had more advantages than any other, and, as John Butterfield &amp; Co. had, in the opinion of Brown, &quot;greater ability, qualification and experience than anybody else to carry out a mail service, John Butterfield &amp; Co. was selected and preferred.&quot;

The route, known as the &quot;Oxbow Route&quot; because of its long curving route through the Southwest, was longer than the Central Overland Trail, but had the advantage of being snow free.

==Route==


The contract with the U.S. Post Office, which went into effect on September 16, 1858, identified the route and divided it into eastern and western divisions. Franklin, Texas, later to be named El Paso, was the dividing point and these two were subdivided into minor divisions, five in the East and four in the West. These minor divisions were numbered west to east from San Francisco, each under the direction of a superintendent.

===Kenyon and Butterfield Jr.: architects of the Butterfield Trail===

John Butterfield Sr. turned to two of his most trusted and experienced employees to put in place the Butterfield Trail. In 1858, with expedition leader Marquis L. Kenyon, John Butterfield Jr. helped to select the route and sites for the stage stations. Kenyon was also a stockholder/director of the Overland Mail Company and the only stockholder, other than John Butterfield, to have significant staging experience. Marquis moved from Mannsville, Jefferson County, to Rome, New York, in 1838. Rome was twelve miles from John Butterfield&#x27;s home in Utica. He immediately became involved with staging. His obituary gives a good summation of his staging activities in Upstate New York and what led him to be involved with the Overland Mail Company:

&quot;His prior occupation was a humble one—that of driver of a stage-coach between Utica and Oswego. It was but two or three years before he had saved enough money from his wages to purchase an interest in the stage-coach line of which he was an employee; and once having placed his foot on the first steps of the ladder, he soon rose, by his business tact and assiduity, to be the principal proprietor of the stage-coach lines converging to this point. At the time that railroads supplanted stages on the leading routes, Mr. Kinyon [Kenyon] was one of the most extensive owners of stage-coach property in Central New York. After the introduction of railroads, he continued to carry on the business of mail contractor and stage proprietor on the small lateral lines; but his business energies were too expansive to be thus curtailed, and he soon found ampler vent for them than the _______ of his former vast carrying business afforded. Hence, when the overland mail route to California was projected, Mr. Kinyon [Kenyon] found a field of business enterprise more commensurate with his capacities. He it was who went over the whole route originally, and surveyed it from the eastern terminus to its western in California.&quot; Returning, he procured the necessary equipment for the route, and went over it again, organizing the route as he proceeded, and remained for nearly a year in California, in charge of the western terminus of the road.&quot;

After winning the contract on September 16, 1857, Butterfield had one year to organize the trail and immediately sent his hand-picked team, headed by Marquis L. Kenyon, to San Francisco to begin the task. The steamer &quot;Star of New York&quot; left New York on November 20, 1857, with passengers &quot;M.L. Kinyon [Kenyon], J. Butterfield [Jr.], F. De Ruyter and S.K. Nellis, who go out to open the Pacific Mail Route across the plains and arrange the western terminus of said route.&quot; The party left San Francisco on January 16, 1858, to begin laying out the trail and selecting the sites for stage stations. They traveled by mule covering about per day. Another party left St. Louis about the same time. Both were to meet at El Paso, Texas, and then return to St. Louis. The party from St. Louis was G.W. Wood, Jesse Talcott, and Charles P. Cole. A Fort Smith, Arkansas, newspaper reported:

&quot;The parties met at El Paso and after recruiting [used in the sense of recovering] a few days, the above gentlemen left for this city—making the trip to this place in twenty-two days from El Paso, and thirty-one days from San Francisco to El Paso, or fifty-six days, through with wagons. …The party from California, in crossing Arizona, took a middle route between Beale&#x27;s and the Southern route – (but little traveled heretofore,) pronounced by them, as an excellent road.&quot;

Another report describes the arrival of the two parties at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and tells us that the choice for the trail did not satisfy Kenyon and his party and they returned from El Paso, Texas, by a different route, which became the trail.

&quot;A portion of the exploring party sent out by the Overland Mail Company, for the purpose of examining the routes for the carriage of the mails from the Valley of the Mississippi to the Pacific coast, which left this city on the 3rd of January last, reached Fort Smith, Arkansas, on their return home, on the 17th inst., accompanied by four of the party which left San Francisco on the 16th of January, on purpose to examine that portion of the route from the Pacific to the Rio Grande. They left El Paso on the 22d of March, thus accomplishing the distance from the Rio Grande to Fort Smith—nine hundred and thirty miles—in the short space of twenty-five days, which we believe is the quickest time on record in crossing the Plains. The party was composed of only eight men, as follows: Major George W. Wood, Jesse Tolcott, Charles P. Cole and J.A. Lilly, of the St. Louis party, and Lieut. Frank de Ryther, James Swartz and John Butterfield Jr. of the San Francisco party. They brought with them one wagon and thirteen animals, which they left at Fort Smith for the party proceeding East. The route traveled on the return trip was different from the one passed over in going out, ... &quot;

John Jr.&#x27;s obituary summarized his accomplishment:
&quot;John Butterfield [Jr.], the man who helped link the East to the West in establishing his famous Overland Mail Route more than half a century ago, died recently at his house in Utica, aged 82 years. His father, John Butterfield, was a superintendent of the Overland Mail Route from San Francisco to St. Louis and thence to eastern cities. The younger Butterfield first traversed the famous route, marked the stations, superintended the work of organization and drove the first stage over the route.

=== John Butterfield makes the Southern Overland Trail his own ===

The history of the Butterfield Trail and the Emigrant Trail are intertwined. It was the purpose of awarding the contract to the Overland Mail Company, on September 16, 1857, not only for a land route to deliver mail from the East to the West coast, but to aid emigrant travel to settle the West. Butterfield accomplished this purpose by providing an improved trail and water sources at regularly spaced stage stations. When researchers hike the Southern Overland Corridor, the most visible ruts are those of the route that the Overland Mail Company established, which others followed. Even though its services ceased on the Southern Overland Corridor in March 1861 because of the impending Civil War, it was so efficient that it remained little changed until its demise with the completion of the railroad in 1880. For this reason, to this day, the Southern Overland Trail is most commonly called &quot;The Butterfield Trail.&quot;

The building of the trail was in two sections: the San Francisco to Los Angeles section and the rest of the distance to Tipton, Missouri. The San Francisco to Los Angeles section was previously one of the most developed. Some changes were made from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Settlements and wagon roads used by local stage lines were strung out between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Some existing structures, such as ranch houses and hotels were contracted as stage stations. One of the most famous is Vallecito, which is preserved as a historic site. Kenyon&#x27;s hardest task building the trail was east of Los Angeles, where his trail was mostly in the open desert.

===Sections shortened or improved===

Waterman L. Ormsby, the correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, a passenger on the first stagecoach going west in September 1858, wrote in his reports of Marquis L. Kenyon&#x27;s part in building the trail and the advantage for emigrants. He writes about the many improvements on the Texas side of the Red River starting about eight miles below Preston.

A lengthy new section of road in Texas is described:

&quot;Another disadvantage under which we labored, this trip, was that our road, for the most of the way, was nearly new, though Mr. Bates claims that from Sherman to [Fort] Belknap at least forty miles are saved by it. It leads through the counties of Grayson, Cooke, Jacks [Jack], Montague, Wise, and Young, all of which contribute towards its expenses, and certainly it must be a favorite with some, for, &quot;though only opened one month before I passed over it, it was already pretty well marked with wagon tracks&quot;. …It must of course improve with every day of its use.&quot;

Another Texas section:

&quot;The new road from Grape Creek to the head of Concho River, Texas, on Mr. Glover&#x27;s division, is also in good order for travel and saves another thirty miles [the total length for this new section is 122 miles]. The New Pass between Los Angeles, and Fort Tejon, California, has been much improved under the superintendence of M.L. Kinyon [Kenyon], as have also been other portions of the route. The route of the company will, of course, be a favorite emigrant route, and will, therefore, be in better order than before, in fact, each month will add new facilities to the overland mail.&quot;

Goddard Bailey&#x27;s report shows that there were 139 stations at the beginning of Butterfield&#x27;s service, but by the time the line ceased operations the line had been improved by the addition of thirty-six more for a total of 175. The new stations were assigned 320 acres each and many took advantage by growing crops which aided the line.

Although there were springs and rain-fed waterholes along the trail, many did not have a sufficient water capacity to supply the line and emigrants. These were dug out to hold a larger capacity. Cisterns were constructed at some of the stations and water wagons were used to transport water from distant sources to fill the cisterns. At the Hueco Tanks in Texas, correspondent Ormsby tells of the tanks being enlarged by Butterfield to hold a year&#x27;s supply of water.

In June 1860 Butterfield passenger Wallace reported to the &quot;Daily Alta California&quot; the following:

&quot;Between Vallecito and Algodones there are eight of these stations, varying from nine to sixteen miles apart. Wells have been sunk at each station, and abundance of good water is obtained, except at the Monument and Garden stations. These waters are brackish and bitter—a flavor not delicate to the taste. Drinking-water is carried from the other stations. These stations are of incalculable worth to emigrants, who are no longer forced to depend upon the precious supply of water which the wells, afforded, and which were liable to be covered up by the sand-waves that move over the desert.&quot;

Other improvements to the trail by Butterfield were the building of bridges:

&quot;Fourteen miles from Boggy Depot [Indian Territory now Oklahoma] we came to Blue River station, where a heavy bridge is building for the company.&quot;

There were two bridges in Arizona. One was across the San Simon River near San Simon Stage Station, and the other across the San Pedro River just north of the San Pedro River Stage Station.

The trail that John Butterfield had established was so efficient that it was little changed until its demise in 1880 with the completion of the railroad, and the impact the Butterfield Trail had for settling the West cannot be understated, as written by President James Buchanan congratulating John Butterfield for his achievement:

&quot;Washington, Oct. 9, 1858
&quot;John Butterfield, Esq&quot;.:
Sir – Your dispatch has been received. I cordially congratulate you upon the result. It is a glorious triumph for civilization and the Union. Settlements will soon follow the course of the road, and the East and West will be bound together by a chain of living Americans, which can never be broken.&quot;

As stated by President Buchanan in the congratulation telegram to John Butterfield, increased emigration would be a result of the improved trail. Just after Butterfield&#x27;s service started in September 1858, there were many newspaper accounts of a large increase in the number of emigrants on the trail. The San Antonio and San Diego Mail Line was operating on 900 miles of the improved trail and benefited by the regularly spaced water holes at Butterfield&#x27;s stations. In October 1859, Superintendent Isaiah C. Woods complimented Butterfield for these improvements and the benefit to the San Antonio and San Diego Mail Line:

&quot;The San Diego Overland Route – Interesting News – From I.C. Woods, who has just crossed the continent on the San Diego and San Antonio Line, says the &quot;San Diego Herald&quot;, we gather some items which may be of interest: Woods pays a high compliment to the staging of the Butterfield Overland Company, along the Gila and over the Desert, particularly to Superintendent Buckley and Warren Hall, the Road Agent of this division [for Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company. They have, he says, really worked wonders in organizing their road in a manner which would be a model in any country. The immigrants are coming slowly along, feeling in no hurry to enter California much before the rains have brought on the new grass. &quot;The stations of the Overland Mail companies and the wells dug by these enterprising men, are proving of incalculable benefit to those crossing with their own teams. The immigration on the Southern route, this year, will figure up from ten thousand to fifteen thousand souls, with a very large amount of cattle and sheep. The old complaints of the immigrants are at present unheard of, owing to the better knowledge of the country now so readily obtained&quot;.”

===San Francisco to Memphis===
As noted above, the route from San Francisco to Fort Smith was the same for both routes. Travel time from Fort Smith to Memphis was about the same as to St. Louis. Management of the route from Fort Smith to Memphis was included in Division 8. However, because of the untamed nature of the Mississippi River and its Arkansas tributaries in those years, the southern route necessarily utilized various alternative routes and methods of travel. At that time, there was no Mississippi River bridge at Memphis, and the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad ran from Hopefield near present-day West Memphis, Arkansas, only to a point 12 miles east of Madison, Arkansas, on the St. Francis River. From there the route headed overland by stagecoach. When the Arkansas River was high enough, the mail could instead travel from Memphis by steamboat down the Mississippi to the mouth of the Arkansas River, navigate up that river to Little Rock, and on from there by stagecoach. When the Arkansas was too low for steamboat traffic, the Butterfield could take the White River to Clarendon, Arkansas, or Des Arc, Arkansas, before switching to the stagecoaches. Sometimes the entire route across eastern Arkansas would be by stage.

==Butterfield&#x27;s stagecoaches, celerity wagons, and water wagons==
No one on a Butterfield stage was ever killed by outlaws, but some died in accidents caused by the mostly unbroken mules or mustangs running wild. Butterfield&#x27;s stages were not allowed to carry shipments of valuables. In Butterfield&#x27;s instructions to his employees was &quot;No money, jewelry, bank notes, or valuables of any nature, will be allowed to be carried under any circumstances whatever.&quot; For this reason, the idea of a &quot;shotgun&quot; rider next to the driver was not employed by Butterfield. When correspondent Ormsby asked one of the stage drivers, &quot;Have you any arms?&quot;, the stage driver answered, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t have any; there&#x27;s no danger.&quot; However, most people on the Butterfield stages were armed, especially in Comanche and Apache territory. In October 1859 correspondent Farwell was a passenger heading east on a Butterfield stage and wrote the following:

&quot;After leaving this station [Arizona&#x27;s San Pedro River Stage Station], the conductor asked &#x27;how many of us were armed&#x27;, and requested that those who had arms should have them ready for use, as we now were in the Apache country. Guns and pistols were produced, and we rode all night with them in our hands.&quot;

=== Mail stagecoach ===
This draft animal-drawn passenger and mail stage had a strong sub-frame covered by decorated wooden paneling with ornate doors and comfortably padded seats. They often had window openings, but the western models designed for the rougher conditions had no glass panels. The roof was strong enough to support a metal railing where luggage could be carried. Seats were often provided on the roof. A canvas-covered boot at the back was used for luggage and mailbags. The difference between a stagecoach and a mail stagecoach is that a large compartment was provided below the driver&#x27;s seat to carry mail and the rear boot for mail was larger. Butterfield&#x27;s stagecoaches were used on 30% of the Southern Overland Trail at the eastern and western ends.

=== Stage (celerity) wagon ===

&quot;Celerity&quot; means &#x27;swiftness of speed&#x27;. The term &quot;celerity wagon&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;stage wagon.&quot; It was about 60% of the weight of a stagecoach and was designed for the rough frontier conditions where the trail was not as well developed, in sand, and for traversing steep inclines. They were open on the sides with no doors or windows. Often a canvas top was supported by light uprights. They had canvas or leather curtains fastened to the top that could be rolled down as a barrier to the dust. The stage wagon was used by Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company exclusively on 70% of the Southern Overland Trail on the section between Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, California. Although the famous passenger wagon manufacturers Abbot-Downing Co. and J.S. &amp; E.A. Abbot Co., of Concord, New Hampshire, never used the name &quot;mud wagon&quot; in their catalogs, there were others who referred to the stage wagon as a &quot;mud wagon.&quot;

=== Butterfield stage manufacture ===
Newspapers published an article in June 1858 that Butterfield&#x27;s mail stagecoaches and stage wagons were made by the J.S. &amp; E.A. Abbot Co. of Concord, New Hampshire. Unfortunately the original order book for that time period in 1858 is missing from the Abbot-Downing Archives. According to the articles, a total of 100 stages were ordered and either put into use or distributed to stations along the trail. Another important reference is from Goddard Bailey&#x27;s report to the government on his inspection trip of the trail in September 1858. He stated in the report &quot;The road is stocked with substantially-built Concord spring wagons...&quot; A July 1858 Memphis newspaper article tells how the stages were delivered and who made them. This, of course was the famous J.S. &amp; E.A. Abbot.

&quot;The Overland Mail Company received by the &quot;Lady Walton&quot; [riverboat], on Tuesday evening last, six stages, and on Wednesday, Mr. Glover left [from Fort Smith] to the direction of El Paso with four of them... The stages were manufactured at Concord, New Hampshire, according to directions given by Col. John Butterfield. They will accommodate from six to nine passengers...&quot;

Another article a week later in the same Memphis newspaper stated that 60 more were to come. The use of &quot;Concord&quot; stagecoaches was also mentioned by correspondent Ormsby.

There were many similar descriptions of Butterfield&#x27;s stage (celerity) wagons given by newspaper correspondents. One was given by Ormsby:

&quot;They are made much like the express wagons in your city which carry goods for transshipment, only they are heavier built, have tops made of canvas, and are set on leather straps instead of springs. Each one has three seats, which are arranged so that the backs let down and form one bed, capable of accommodating from four to ten persons, according to their size and how they lie. From Memphis [actually Little Rock] and from St. Louis [actually Tipton] to Fort Smith regular stage coaches are used, similar in every respect to those employed in the Atlantic States; but from Fort Smith onwards the vehicles used are not unlike a Jersey wagon, they are of the description known as Celerity wagons, being similar in build to the common Troy coach, and the body is hung upon the same kind of springs [thorough-brace] and in a similar manner. Instead, however, of the heavy wooden top, with iron railing around it, in common use, they have a light canvas covering supported by light uprights, after the manner of a Jersey wagon. The covering affords ample protection against the weather, while it greatly diminishes the weight of the vehicle as well as its liability to upset. Each one had three seats, which are arranged so that the backs let down and form one bed, capable of accommodating from four to ten persons, according to their size, and how they lie. The company has over one hundred of these coaches on the ground, and has been running them regularly and with profitable results, for some time past, upon portions of the route.&quot;

The same stage or stage driver was not used all the way through on the trip. They were changed frequently, both to avoid fatigue for the stage drivers and to avoid the braking down of the stages. Correspondent Ormsby reported that &quot;I understand they [Overland Mail Company] have bought horses and mules, and a wagon or coach for every thirty miles, of the route, while arrangements have been made at all the stations for changing horses, feeding, &amp;c., so that they can run straight through.&quot;

From these references it is seen that Butterfield employed 100 stages distributed along the 2,700-mile trail from Tipton, Missouri, to San Francisco, California. Approximately 34 western style J.S. &amp; E.A. Abbot mail stagecoaches were used on the settled and partially settled sections of the trail from Tipton, Missouri, to Fort Smith, Arkansas, and from Los Angeles to San Francisco, California. Stagecoach trails had already been established between these points, with a few Butterfield improvements to the trail. About sixty-six J.S. &amp; E.A. Abbot stage (celerity) wagons, partially designed by John Butterfield, were distributed on the 1,920-mile trail through the frontier from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, California.

=== Other wagons ===
Other wagons used by Butterfield were water wagons and freight wagons. Water wagons were an important, but expensive, necessity. To straighten out the trail, so they wouldn&#x27;t have to zigzag from water hole to water hole, water wagons were used to transport water from a source to stage stations that were built on the straightened-out sections. An example was Ewell&#x27;s Stage Station in the Sulphur Springs Valley of eastern Arizona. At the beginning of Butterfield&#x27;s service, after leaving Apache Pass, the trail jogged northwest to Dos Cabezas Spring and then southwest to Dragoon Springs Stage Station at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains. In the spring of 1858 a new trail was made from the western entrance of Apache Pass and then along an almost straight line to the north end of the Dragoon Mountains. At approximately the midpoint of this new section a station and cistern were constructed. A water wagon was used to supply the cistern with water from Dos Cabezas Spring, which was now four miles north of the new station. Water wagons were also used to supply unusually long stretches of trail that lacked water sources. A newspaper article tells us of one of these situations:

&quot;Chidester also informs us of the means to supply the stations in the Llanos Estecados [in Texas], or Staked Plains, with water. This desert, by the route of the Company&#x27;s road, is seventy-five miles wide. From streams on either side of the Plains the Company supplies water to the stations with regular water trains, fitted up expressly for the purpose. The wagons used for this purpose are constructed of large tin boilers, similar in shape to the boilers of a steamboat, and capable of holding as much water as a team of six mules can draw. These trains run regularly, conveying water to the different stations, where large reservoirs are prepared to receive and preserve it for the use of passengers and the employés and stock of the Company. This is, of course, a very expensive method of supplying the indispensable element, but, as thus far all efforts to obtain it by boring or otherwise have proved little, the Company must submit to it for the present.&quot;

==Subcontractors==
Butterfield subcontracted the section between Des Arc and Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Chidester, Reeside &amp; Co.:

&quot;The Overland California United States Mail left Memphis on Thursday [September 16] last. It is brought by the Memphis and Little Rock Rail Road to within twelve miles of Madison, on St. Francis River, thence by light vehicles to Des Arc—thence by Messrs. Chidester, Reeside &amp; Co.&#x27;s line of four horse U.S. Mail coaches to Fort Smith where it meets the St. Louis mail. Messrs. Chidester, Reeside &amp; Co., are subcontractors under Butterfield &amp; Co., from Memphis to Fort Smith…&quot;

In an interview Chidester stated that he was using Butterfield&#x27;s stage wagons:

&quot;The vehicles used upon the road between Fort Smith are of the description known as Celerity wagons…. The company [Butterfield] have over one hundred of these coaches on the ground…&quot;

==Stage drivers==
The stage drivers, like many of Butterfield&#x27;s employees, were mostly from upstate New York. An example for the many Butterfield employees being from New York State is shown in the 1860 Federal Census for Tucson. On page one a caption states &quot;Great Overland Mail Stations,&quot; and of the 40 entries, 16 are listed as being born in New York State. Correspondent Ormsby reported that:

&quot;The employees of the company, I found, without exception, to be courteous, civil, and attentive. They are most of them from the East, and many, especially of the drivers, from New York state. I found the drivers on the whole line, with but few exceptions, experienced men. Several are a little reckless and too anxious to make fast time, but as a general thing they are very cautious.&quot;

==Draft animals==
Correspondent Ormsby reported: &quot;Our horses were four in number, that being the allotment all along the line from Tipton [Missouri] to San Francisco [California].&quot; Many correspondents&#x27; reports describe the problems for the Overland Mail Company using unbroken wild mules and mustangs between Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Los Angeles, California. By most accounts, wild mules were used and some wild mustangs. It is surprising that the use of wild draft animals did not hinder the Overland Mail Company stages from accomplishing its contractual agreed to time schedule. The problem with the unbroken mules and mustangs was expressed in correspondent Farwell&#x27;s report:

&quot;We arrived at the station about 10 o&#x27;clock, A.M., about 1 mile to the eastward of the river. Some coffee was prepared for us, and we were soon ready to start again. This time, after we were all seated in the coach, the horses, which were said to have been always kind and gentle, refused to move. After a great deal of beating, coaxing and a trial of various methods suggested by almost every one present, we were all obliged to get out again, and after a great deal of trouble, the horses were started, but the passengers being out of the coach, the driver was obliged to stop again, and again, after they were in, the horses refused to go. After working with the might and main for some time, they were got off upon a run, and this time they were kept going. Hitherto, in starting from any station, a person was obliged to stand at the heads of the horses—they being with a few exceptions&#x27; wild ones—until the driver was seated on his box, the reins gathered and everything in readiness, when he would give the signal, &quot;turn &#x27;em loose,&quot; or &quot;let &#x27;em go,&quot; and they would go upon a run. As we get further along, however, they are growing tame, and are more easily handled.&quot;

==Sleeping on the stages==
For the 25-day trip, the Butterfield stages did not stop for the passengers to sleep. They had to sleep on the stages. Many correspondents reported humorous stories about their experiences trying to sleep on the Butterfield stages. One of the most common problems was the losing of their hats while sleeping caused by the open-sided stage (celerity) wagons providing little protection from the wind. National Park Service Historian Frank Norris stated in an interview that &quot;According to historian Gerald T. Ahnert, &#x27;pulling up to a Butterfield stage station was like making a NASCAR pit stop.&#x27;&quot;

==Extant Butterfield stages==
All the stages that weren&#x27;t in use were distributed at stations along the 2,700-mile trail. At the closing of Butterfield’s operations on the Southern Overland Trail in March 1861, because of the start of the Civil War, many of the stages were confiscated and used by the Confederate Army as military vehicles. As much of the equipment as possible was transferred to the central trail to continue the Overland Mail Company contract. Only enough of the stages made it to the central route to operate the line from Salt Lake City, Utah, to western Nevada. The biography of Edwin R. Purple tells of transferring the stages to the central route. He was employed by the Overland Mail Company as a financial agent at Fort Yuma, California, in May 1860. At the closing of the line, on the Southern Overland Trail, in March 1861, he was ordered to transfer the stock and stages from Tucson, Arizona, to Los Angeles, California, to supply the central route line, which was to commence operations on July 1, 1861. On May 8, 1861, with 30 men, he left Los Angeles and successfully arrived at Salt Lake City on June 16 with 18 stage wagons and 130 horses. In a discussion by Gerald T. Ahnert with members of the True West Historical Society, it was suggested that many of these original stagecoaches and stage wagons were bought by movie companies in the 1930s through 1950s and used in their movie productions. Many were destroyed in scenes of the stages being attacked.

==Operations==
Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company held the U.S. Mail contract from September 16, 1858, on a six-year contract. The first stage going east left San Francisco at 10 minutes past midnight on September 14, 1858. The mail from San Francisco reached St. Louis in 24 days, 18 hours, and 26 minutes. The first stage going west left Tipton, Missouri, at 8 am on September 16, 1858. The mail was carried by railroad for the first from St. Louis to Tipton.

Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company made two trips a week from September 1858 to March 1861. At the start of service, the mail would leave St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, California, every Monday and Thursday. A December 1, 1858, advertisement stated that the days for departure from San Francisco on Monday and Friday and that the through fare to Terminus of Pacific Railroad as $100. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper on January 11, 1859, that the through fare to Terminus of Pacific Railroad had increased to $200. Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company had 139 stage stations at the start of service but more stations were built after service started and increased to about 170. As noted about 100 stages were employed.

===Pony Express as part of the Overland Mail Company contract===
When the Overland Mail Company Contract No. 12578 was transferred to the Central Overland Trail, the contract was amended on March 12, 1861, to include the Pony Express. The new contract stated the following:

&quot;And to be required also, during the continuance of their contract, or until completion of the overland telegraph, to run a &quot;pony-express&quot; semi-weekly at a schedule time of ten days, eight months of the year, and twelve days four months of the year [presumably the winter months], and &quot;to convey for the Government free of charge five pounds of mail matter&quot;, with liberty of charging the public for transportation of letters by said express not exceeding $1 per half ounce. The compensation for the whole service [which included the stage line mail service] to be $1,000,000 per annum, to take effect on or before the 1st of July, 1861 and to expire the 1st of July, 1864 [the same date for the end of the old contract No. 12578]. The number of the route to be changed to 10773 and the service to be recorded in the route register for Missouri.&quot;

In behalf of the Overland Mail Company, the order was signed by president W.B. Dinsmore. William B. Dinsmore became president after John Butterfield was voted out as president. Butterfield still remained a stockholder. The Pony Express was terminated before the end of the contract because the telegraph line was completed October 24, 1861.

A correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, Waterman L. Ormsby, remarked after his trek through the western US to San Francisco on a Butterfield Stagecoach thus: &quot;Had I not just come out over the route, I would be perfectly willing to go back, but I now know what Hell is like. I&#x27;ve just had 24 days of it.&quot; Ormsby was the only passenger on the first East-West run of the Butterfield Stage who journeyed the entire distance of the mail route. He sent periodic dispatches to the paper describing his journey, including the pickup of passengers outside the Lawrence Livery Stables.

Near the end of Butterfield&#x27;s service, in March 1861 on the Southern Overland Trail, John Butterfield was voted out as president of the Overland Mail Company because he wasn&#x27;t making money for the stockholders. He remained a stockholder in the company and attended the meetings with vice-president William B. Dinsmore now elevated to president of the company. The Congressional report shows the modifications to the six-year Butterfield contract ending on September 15, 1864. Kirby Sanders was the National Park Service consulting historian and lead researcher for compiling the history for the master Special Resource Study for the Butterfield National Trail project and put into perspective the confusion over Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.&#x27;s only involvement on the Butterfield Trail (Southern Overland Trail). He stated that they had only a secondary role and may have run a &quot;trunk route&quot; off of Butterfield from Los Angeles to San Diego. Waddell F. Smith, grandson of William Bradford Waddell, one of the founders of the Pony Express put into perspective the later involvement of Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., two years after the Butterfield contract ended. What was known as the &quot;Grand Consolidation,&quot; of the three stage lines, that held the mail contract on the Central Overland Trail, was achieved by Ben Holladay, &quot;The Stagecoach King.&quot; The three lines now comprising the consolidation were the Pioneer Stage Line, the Overland Mail Company, and Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. This three-million-dollar corporation, formed on February 5, 1866, became a new giant with an increased capitalization of ten million dollars. Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. changed its name to Wells, Fargo and Company and was approved by the stockholders on December 10, 1866. Wells, Fargo and Company bought out Ben Holladay and was finally operating as a mail carrying stage company, with their name finally on a transom rail of a stagecoach, on the Central Overland Trail. But the end was in sight, as the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad was nearing completion. On May 16, 1868, the board of directors of Wells, Fargo and Company authorized the sale of the company&#x27;s stage lines, although they remained in operation until the completion of the railroad on May 10, 1869.

===Transfer to Central Overland Trail===
Butterfield’s Overland Mail Company was ordered to transfer the company to the Union-held Central Overland Trail, because of the impending start of the Civil War. The last Overland Mail Company mail bag left St. Louis, Missouri, March 18, 1861. This last mail arrived in San Francisco, California April 13, 1861.

William Buckley, of Watertown, New York, was the Superintendent of the Fourth Division for Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company on the Southern Overland Trail. When Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company contract was transferred to the Central Overland Trail, although some of the employees returned to Upstate New York, some retained their positions with the company. William Buckley was one of the original employees to continue with the company on the Central Overland Trail and took the position of Superintendent. Although William B. Dinsmore was now the company president, John Butterfield was still a stockholder and it can be seen in this article that the Overland Mail Company was still called &quot;Butterfield&#x27;s&quot; by the employees.

Only enough equipment and employees were transferred to stock the trail from Carson City, Nevada, to Salt Lake City, Utah. A June 1861 newspaper accounted the details:

&quot;Great Salt Lake City, June 5, 1861. ... William Buckley, formerly the Superintendent of the Butterfield route from San Francisco to El Paso, F. Cluggage, an Agent in that route and Bolivar Roberts, the Superintendent of the western division on this route, came in a week ago yesterday from Carson, which I noticed in my last letter, and on Friday Edward Fisher, and four other employees in some department, came in from St. Joseph. ...They have, whatever else besides, at least made all the necessary arrangements for a vigorous start to the daily mail, and everything will be ready by the first week in July [July 1 was when the line was ordered to start by the new contract] to fulfill the of obligations of the million contract. ... Last evening, profiting by a conversation with Mr. Buckley, I obtained from him a copy of his measurement of the road from Carson to this city [Salt Lake City]. ... Placerville [California] being the terminus, another 100 miles should be added between that and Carson, as the entire distance of the Butterfield new route. These are the stations now in use and to be continued, from the facilities they afford of proximity to wood, water and feed; but I am informed the Butterfield Company propose erecting intermediate stations every twelve miles, on account of the greater amount of horses required for the accomplishment of the journey within the specified time of sixteen days from St. Joseph to Placerville.”

Under the Confederate States of America, the abandoned Butterfield route between Texas and Southern California operated under a new Federal contract as part of the Overland Mail Corporation route with limited success by George Henry Giddings. The contract was given in May 1861 and was to start on April 1, 1861, and to end on June 30, 1862. &quot;An attempt was made to fulfill the contract, beginning April 1, but faced with insurmountable obstacles and with the development of the Civil War, the contractors were compelled to give it up. The eastern portion of the line was curtailed June 30, 1861. The final chapter was closed when the latter part of the line was discontinued Aug. 1, 1861.&quot; Wells Fargo continued its stagecoach runs to mining camps in more northern locations until the coming of the US Transcontinental Railroad in 1869.

At least four battles of the American Civil War occurred at or near Butterfield mail posts, the Battle of Stanwix Station, the Battle of Picacho Pass, Second Battle of Mesilla and the Battle of Pea Ridge. Four clashes between the Apache and Confederate or Union forces in the Apache Wars occurred on the route, First Battle of Dragoon Springs, Second Battle of Dragoon Springs, the Battle of Apache Pass and Skirmish in Doubtful Canyon. Confederates attempted to keep the stations from Tucson to Mesilla open while they destroyed the stations from Tucson to Yuma which were used to supply the Union army as it advanced through Traditional Arizona. The burning of the Stanwix Station and others led to a significant delay to the Union advance, postponing the Fall of Tucson, Arizona&#x27;s western Confederate capital, which housed one of two territorial courts; the other court was in Mesilla. All said engagements happened in the Confederate Arizona and Arkansas sectors of the mail route.

==Modern remnants==
There are two surviving stage stations in San Diego County: Oak Grove Butterfield Stage Station in Oak Grove, California, and Warner&#x27;s Ranch near Warner Springs, California. Both properties, apart, were declared National Historic Landmarks in 1961.

Elkhorn Tavern in Pea Ridge National Military Park was another destination along the route that was rebuilt after the Civil War. It is on one of the last sections of the trail that still exists: The segment of Old Wire Road running through Northwest Arkansas. Also in Arkansas is the town of Pottsville, which was built around Potts Inn. Potts Inn was finished in 1859 and was a popular stop along the route. It survives as a museum owned by the Pope County Historic Society.
When it was first established, the route proceeded due east from Franklin, Texas, toward Hueco Tanks; the remains of a stagecoach stop are still visible at the Hueco Tanks State Historic Site.

The summit of Guadalupe Peak in Guadalupe Mountains National Park features a stainless steel pyramid erected in 1958 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail, which passed south of the mountain.
==National historic trail==
On March 30, 2009, President Barack Obama signed Congressional legislation (Sec. 7209 of P.L. 111-11) to conduct a study of designating the trail a National Historic Trail. The National Park Service concluded its Special Resource Study/Environmental Assessment in 2018 and determined that it would be feasible and desirable as part of the National Trails System.

Congress passed a bill designating the Butterfield Overland National Historic Trail in 2022. The trail covers 3,292 miles in eight states. The bill uniquely includes a provision specifying that the trail shall not hinder any energy transmission project. The Park Service will develop a comprehensive administration plan.

==In popular culture==

The Butterfield Overland Mail Company is featured in the 1957 film &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;. The railroad was not completed through Arizona until 1879, eighteen years after Butterfield&#x27;s Overland Mail Company ceased its service through Arizona. Also Butterfield never used his name on a stagecoach, only &quot;Overland Mail Company.&quot;

The Butterfield Overland Mail Company is the main subject of the 1965 film &quot;Apache Uprising&quot;, featuring several main characters under the employ of Butterfield: District Manager, Station Agent, and Driver.

A Butterfield Overland stagecoach is also featured in the 2015 western film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. The stagecoach in the movie was not representative of John Butterfield&#x27;s stagecoaches as the movie fictionally represented the Central Overland Trail after the Civil War. John Butterfield never used his name on a stage; only &quot;Overland Mail Company&quot; and only operated on the Southern Overland Trail.

<text>Sergeant Joseph Lister VC (19 October 1886 − 19 January 1963) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Lister was 30 years old, and a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during World War I when he received the Victoria Cross for his actions at the battle of Passchendaele, Belgium on 9 October 1917. Lister was a native of Stockport, and served in the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. He earned his medal for storming two machine gun posts and capturing 100 enemy troops.

On 9 October 1917 east of Ypres, Belgium, seeing that the advance of his company was held up by machine-gun fire from the direction of a pillbox, Sergeant Lister dashed ahead of his men and found the gun - he shot two of the gunners and the remainder surrendered. He then went to the pillbox and shouted to the occupants to surrender. They did so with the exception of one man whom the sergeant shot, whereupon about 100 of the enemy emerged from the shell-holes further to the rear and surrendered.

Sergeant Lister survived the war and died in 1963. He is buried in Willow Grove Cemetery, Reddish. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

100 years after his actions, Salford City Council unveiled a commemorative paving stone, outside Broughton Hub, in his honour.

<text>Daniel Robert Kausman (born 13 October 1972), better known by his stage name DJ Die, is an English DJ and music producer. He was a founder of drum and bass label Full Cycle Recordings and a member of Roni Size &amp; Reprazent (1997 Mercury Prize winners) and Breakbeat Era.

Kausman spent his formative years in Barnstaple before moving to Bristol in 1985 as a teenager. An early interest in house and hardcore led to a musical partnership with friend Jody Wisternoff (who later formed Way Out West with Nick Warren). Die DJ&#x27;d for a brief period with Circus Warp – a free party sound system. Recording together under the aliases of Tru Funk and Sub Love on Three Stripe Records, they created hardcore staples like &quot;4am&quot; and made numerous DJing appearances at early Universe raves. The partnership, however, was a brief one.

After a chance meeting with Roni Size at Bristol&#x27;s Replay Records store in 1992, this led to their first collaboration in the form of Agility for V Recordings and Die&#x27;s ongoing contributions to the Full Cycle Recordings catalogue.

Together with Size, he originated the seminal &quot;Music Box&quot; which was to become the title track of the debut &quot;Full Cycle&quot; compilation in 1996. Emerging firstly as a core member of Reprazent and later in 1998 as one third of Breakbeat Era (a project spawned by the &quot;Music Box&quot; track of the same name), he soon found himself remixing for DJs including DJ Shadow, Towa Tei and DJ Cam. His remix of the Reprazent single &quot;Watching Windows&quot; was released in its own right by Talkin&#x27; Loud. He has his own label called Clear Skyz.

DJ Die has also recorded under the aliases Break &amp; Die (DJ Die and DJ Break), Die &amp; Clipz (DJ Die and DJ Clipz), Swabe, 4 Tree, Breakbeat Era (with Leonie Laws and Roni Size), DNA (with Bill Riley), Scorpio (with Roni), Wings (with Roni and Krust), Kamanchi (with Krust) and DieMantle (with Dismantle).

<doc id="933764" wikidata="Q1148465" url="?curid=933764" title="Sturmey-Archer">
<text>Sturmey-Archer was a manufacturing company originally from Nottingham, England. It primarily produced bicycle hub gears, brakes and a great many other sundry bicycle components, most prominently during its heyday as a subsidiary of the Raleigh Bicycle Company. In the past, it also manufactured motorcycle hubs, gearboxes and engines.

The company was founded in 1902 by Henry Sturmey and James Archer under the guidance of Frank Bowden, the primary owner of Raleigh. In 2000, the assets and trademarks of Sturmey-Archer were sold to Sun Race of Taiwan which was renamed Sun Race Sturmey-Archer Inc. and production moved to Taiwan.

==Products==
All Sturmey-Archer gear hubs use epicyclic (planetary) geartrains of varying complexity. The AW is the simplest, using one set of planetary gears with four planets. The AM uses three compound planets with differently sized cogs machined from a common shaft to engage the gear ring and sun gear separately, while the close-ratio three-speeds, and hubs with four or more speeds, use multiple planetary geartrains. Depending on the specific hub these may be in series with each other, or with one or the other set being selectable at any given time by locking a particular sun gear to the axle.

===&#x27;K&#x27; family hub gears===
In 1921, the K hub was introduced as an updated and improved version of the X, later FX hub (following the introduction of fine axle threading) - it is the Model X which was manufactured under license by BSA as their 3 speed hub until 1956. The new K model three speed had ratios of 75%, 100%, and 133%, the same as the later AW, however its internal workings were substantially different. Most notable was the 6-prong ramped sliding clutch which was mounted between springs, this gave the advantage of lateral movement being possible without shifter movement and allowed gears to be pre-selected while pedalling, the ratio would change when pedal force was relaxed, freeing the mechanism to slide into the new gear and under spring pressure. The ramped clutch dogs and sprung mount also permitted the K hub to be without a neutral position between the &#x27;Normal&#x27; direct drive gear, and the &#x27;High&#x27; overdrive gear, both the SW and AW (until the mid 1990s) have this neutral position. The gear ring dogs would ratchet around the clutch using the ramps and springs if the hub was trying to engage Normal and High gear at the same time, though allowing this to happen through slow shifting can cause excessive clutch wear and render the hub inoperable. In Low gear, this isn&#x27;t a problem as the low gear pawls can be overrun by a higher gear, while Normal and High gears use the same pawls, requiring an alternative solution.

The K hub spawned a Tricoaster version with back pedal brake, designated KC, in 1921 and both close ratio (KS), and medium ratio (KSW) variants in 1932 and 1933 respectively. With the introduction of 90mm drum brakes LBF/BF/BFC and LBR/BR/BRC in 1931, the first Sturmey-Archer 3-speed drum brake was introduced, the KB. The KB was joined in 1934 by the KT 111mm tandem drum brake, part of a family of 111mm drum brakes alongside the BFT and BRT front and rear drum brakes (BR type drum brakes are not gear hubs and are instead threaded for fixed sprockets or freewheels). The KT lasted only four years, being replaced by the AT (AW based 111mm drum brake) in 1938 when the K was replaced by the AW. The AT, BFT and BRT all went out of production because of hostilities in 1941 and never re-entered production.

===&#x27;T&#x27; family hub gears===
Despite the primary selling point of Sturmey-Archer hubs being their offer of three gears when rivals managed only two, Sturmey-Archer produced a range of two speed hubs in the 1930s. This began with the T and TF (identical hubs, F denoting a fixed sprocket) in 1933, alongside a version with a 90mm drum brake; with a rod brake operation and freewheel, this was TB, with a rod operation and fixed wheel, this was TBF, while a C was added to either designation to denote cable operated brakes instead of rods. In reality, an end user can easily switch between fixed and free, and rod and cable by swapping out common parts, though the hub shell will continue to show the designation for a given hub&#x27;s original configuration. The T, TF, TB, TBF, TBFC, and TBC all had a 25% reduction below direct drive

In 1936, a close ratio 2 speed was introduced, this was called TC and offered a 13.46% reduction below direct drive.

Hubs manufactured in the 1930s have a date stamp given as a number at the end of the model designation, this can be seen on examples of all of the hubs mentioned in this section, as well as some A and F family hubs. A 1936 TC hub would, for example, be marked TC6, TC 6 or TC-6.

===&#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;F&#x27; family hub gears===
Sturmey-Archer&#x27;s most widely known product is the AW wide-ratio three-speed hub gear, introduced in 1938 (though patented in 1936) and still in production in a substantially modified form as of 2018. It is the sole survivor of a much larger range of &quot;A&quot; model three-speed hubs, including the AG Dynohub, AB 90mm drum brake hub, AM (medium ratio for &quot;club&quot; riders), the AC and AR (close ratio racing hubs for time trialists) and the ASC (a unique three-speed fixed gear). In 1939 a four-speed close ratio model AF was released, intended as a close ratio 3 speed with an additional low gear for hills, this was discontinued in 1941 and succeeded by the near identical FC hub in 1947. 1939 also saw the introduction of the FM four speed medium ratio hub, which was mechanically very similar to the AF and FC.

Post-war, in 1946, the FW four speed wide ratio hub was introduced and spawned the FG Dynohub and FB 90mm drum brake hub. the FG would come to characterise the output of the heyday of Raleigh Superbe model bicycles, while the relative longevity of the FW can be largely attributed to its deployment on high end Moulton Bicycles through the 1960s until its discontinuation in 1970.

The FW led to the development of a series of internally similar &#x27;S5&#x27; five-speed models, and by 1994, Sturmey-Archer were producing seven-speed hubs. Production was low, and in the mid-2000s these were discontinued, hub geared bicycles having gone mostly out of fashion.

=== SW hub gears ===
The brief story of the Sturmey-Archer SW series medium-flange wide-ratio three-speed hub provides strong substantiation of the merits of the AW design.

Sturmey-Archer Gears Ltd. designed the type SW Mk. 1 medium-flange wide-ratio three-speed hub in 1954 and began production by 1955, intending it to replace the AW series of large-flange hubs which were intended for discontinuation upon the SW&#x27;s introduction (AW hubs were still being produced in 1956, and may have continued throughout the SW&#x27;s run, despite being absent from catalogues).

Compared to the AW&#x27;s 25% reduction in first gear, direct-drive second gear, and 33.33% overdrive 3rd gear, the SW offered slightly wider gearing, referred to by Brian Hayes as &quot;super-wide&quot; gearing, with 27.7% reduction for first gear, direct-drive second, and taller 38.4% overdrive third gear. Riders appreciate the nearly silent operation of its springless &#x27;centrifugal&#x27; pawls (while the pawls are often described as being centrifugal in operation, they in fact operate by a rocking motion as the freewheel ratchet teeth pass over them, pushing them back and forth in their slightly oversized sockets).

Smaller and lighter than an AW hub, the SW was aptly, but unfortunately, described by Sturmey-Archer as having &quot;fewer working parts than any other wide-ratio 3-Speed hub&quot; and was thought to be less costly to manufacture than the AW series that had been in production since 1938.

The new hub turned out to be slow to engage drive because the mode of pawl engagement necessitated fewer freewheel stops and could not be &quot;pre-shifted&quot; like an AW can while changing &#x27;up&#x27;, and the AW&#x27;s predecessor, the &#x27;K&#x27;, can while changing in either direction. This pre-selection of gears was never advocated by Sturmey-Archer. More troubling, the unique crescent-shaped pawls can have slippage issues, even with correct toggle chain adjustment, as engagement of only two of the three pawls in each freewheel is insufficiently stable to hold normal levels of torque. This is more pronounced in hubs which are sticky inside from incorrect lubrication, and ones which have been allowed to wear through poor maintenance or, less commonly, heavy use. Attempts were made to correct the issues the SW experienced, with surviving examples showing two different planet cage retention methods (mandating two different axle designs), three different planet cage pawl ring designs, two different gear ring designs, two different sliding clutch designs, two different pawl designs and two different axle key designs, one for each of the two indicator rod designs which were used with the SW, a two piece, left hand indicating design between 1954 and mid-1958, requiring a plain drilling in the axle key and a fully drilled through axle, and a less common threaded axle key, for use with a standard AW type right hand indicating design, introduced at around the same time as the re-marketing of the AW in the late summer of 1958 and permitting the use of a partially solid axle.

Sturmey-Archer had intended for the SW to completely replace the AW hub, and had designed a complete family of SW series hubs. The SB was intended to replace the AB/ABC 3 speed hub with 90mm drum brake, and the SG was intended to replace the AG Three speed &#x27;Dyno-Three&#x27; Dynohub. Both the SB and SG would have used a modified set of SW internals with a shortened planet cage to facilitate the additional functionality on the left side of the hub. Technical drawings for both the SB and SG exist and both appeared in catalogues, however there is no evidence that either hub went into production and the AB/ABC and AG re-appeared alongside the AW in 1958.

The AW had been built under license by The Hercules Cycle and Motor Company as the A type in the 1940s and the B type in the 1950s (there is no functional difference and the letter merely denotes the decade). Hercules put their name on SW hubs too, though these are far less common than Sturmey-Archer branded SWs.

After the failure of the SW in the market and the re-commitment to the AW, Sturmey-Archer continued to widely license the design, with fully interchangeable clones of the AW eventually being made under labels including J.C. Higgins, Sears, Austro-Daimler, Brompton, Brampton, SunTour, and others.

===S2 &#x27;Automatic&#x27;===
In 1966 Sturmey-Archer launched a new two-speed hub with a backpedal shifting action similar to the Fichtel and Sachs &#x27;Torpedo Zwei Gang Duomatic&#x27;. The S2 – Sturmey-Archer&#x27;s first 2-speed hub since the demise of the T series in 1941 and the last two speed they would make in the UK – featured a direct drive and a 28.6% gear reduction. While its lack of need for a gear cable might have led to the S2 being a popular choice for small wheeled and folding bicycles, the nature of the gears meant that a small wheeled bicycle would struggle to obtain acceptably high gearing within the constraints of a) the size of its wheels, b) the minimum size of sprocket which could be fitted and, c) the maximum size of chainwheel which could be obtained. For these reasons, it was commercially unsuccessful.

Shifting the S2&#x27;s gears was achieved by reversing the pedal action such that the sprocket and driver rotated 1/4 turn anti-clockwise relative to the axle (the amount of pedal movement required for this is gearing dependent). The up-shift and down-shift process is the same, with the hub toggling between gears; there is a consequent risk of overshooting the desired gear. The S2 has no equivalent to the sliding clutch seen in 3- and 4-speed Sturmey-Archer hub designs, there is indeed no lateral movement within the hub in use.

To achieve this radically different mode of shifting gears, the hub featured a unique driver with a 4 spline keyed socket in the middle (similar to, though not interchangeable with, later &#x27;No Intermediate Gear&#x27; AW drivers), into which sat a selector sleeve. The 4 cuttings on the selector sleeve (2 shallow and 2 deep, arranged alternately) enabled the selector sleeve to transmit drive from the driver to the backs of the two unique high gear pawls, with said pawls either allowed to engage the hub shell for direct drive (deep selector sleeve cutting) or tripped out such that drive is transmitted only to the gear ring (shallow selector sleeve cutting). Low gear then operates in the same way as on an AW hub, with the drive of the ring gear turning the planet cage (via the planet gears) – and hence the shell – at a reduced speed.

The S2 hub features three low gear pawls mounted in its shortened planet cage, necessitating a low gear freewheel track with twelve stops instead of the 10 which would be found on a contemporary AW, this means that an S2 freewheeling in low gear will tick more frequently and more loudly than an AW in low gear at the same speed in a wheel of the same size. Because of this difference in the left (low gear) freewheel, and the short planet cage, the S2 has a gear ring pressed into the shell near the middle, with the mechanism occupying little more than half of the shell volume and the rest being left empty. For this reason, the S2 has a unique shell and its internals cannot be installed in the shell of another model.

The S2 is an unusual hub, with only 12,500 produced, and they are rarely available for sale. The hub was discontinued in 1972 and should not be confused with the S2, S2C and S2K hubs currently manufactured in Taiwan by Sun Race Sturmey-Archer.

===Hybrid gear options===
Sturmey-Archer hubs are seen by many as an alternative to Derailleur gears, however on many models of Sturmey-Archer hub, the two can be combined to offer a setup with many of the benefits of both systems - offering more, closer spaced, gears while continuing to offer a very wide overall range.

The majority of Sturmey-Archer gear hubs can be converted to hybrid gearing by fitting a rear derailleur to the bike and finding a suitable method of attaching more than one sprocket to the hub driver.

For the &#x27;three spline&#x27; driver, an additional sprocket may be added in place of the spacers so long as care is taken to ensure the gap between the sprockets is not so great that the chain will drop into it instead of moving between sprockets. Two sprocket blocks have been produced for these hubs in the past too, though these are now obsolete and hard to find.

For the 12-spline driver of late 1930s and 1940s sporting hubs, similar arrangements may be made as for a 3-spline driver, however component sourcing is likely to be a bigger problem in line with the general scarcity of these drivers and the sprockets which fit them.

For the threaded drivers which were fitted to touring hubs before 1951, a standard thread-on freewheel may be fitted, although care must be taken to ensure there is sufficient clearance in the frame and sufficient thread engagement to ensure the setup is safe. More than three sprockets is unlikely to yield successful results.

Some Sturmey-Archer hubs, by their design, are fundamentally incompatible with hybrid gearing and hybrid setups should not be attempted with them. These are:

* AF, FM, FC, and AC because of the secondary planet train which is used to advance the sun gear in Low and High gears, this causes the internals to turn as the bike freewheels and applies tension to the bottom of the chain, this tension will damage a derailleur setup. For the same reason, it is normal for bikes with these hubs to spin their pedals when they are pushed forwards, where on other Sturmey-Archer gear hubs this would indicate an overtightened left hand bearing cone.
* ASC Three Speed fixed gear, in addition to the reason set out above, any fixed gear hub is incompatible with derailleur gearing because of the need to apply chain tension in both directions when slowing down on a fixed gear bike.

===Dynohub===
The Dynohub was Sturmey-Archer&#x27;s hub dynamo (generator) for bicycles. The initial GH12 12-volt model was introduced in 1936 and followed two years later by the GH8. This 8-volt unit was discontinued in 1941 and replaced in 1945 by the lighter-weight GH6 6-volt version, which remained in production until 1984. The term &quot;dynohub&quot; is sometimes applied generically to bicycle hub dynamos, but it originates as, and remains, a trademark.

The GH6 version produced a rated output of 6 V, 0.33 A (2 W) from a 20-pole ring magnet with a stator having a continuous winding. Original headlamp bulbs are 6 V, 0.25 A (1.5 W) (e.g., CRY5) and a rear bulb of 6 V 0.04A (0.24W) (e.g., CRY8). This is different from a modern standard bicycle dynamo, though replacements can still be obtained. Common substitutions are the modern standard 2.4 W headlamp bulb and a tail lamp bulb of 0.6 W. One rider reports much more light with a 6.3 V, 0.25 A (1.6 W) type 40 bulb. LED conversions are possible and will output a much brighter light than incandescent or halogen bulbs, though the LED alternatives require the fitting of a voltage regulator and will strobe 10 times per wheel revolution if not fitted with a capacitor or rectifier to smooth the AC current output from the Dynohub.

Rated output was reached at around 20 km/h (12 mph), a rotational speed of approximately 160 rpm. The name dynamo implies DC output, but as usual with bicycle dynamos (known as &quot;generators&quot; in North America), output was in fact alternating current.

Dynohubs were offered as front hubs and as rear geared hubs. The AG was an AW three-speed rear hub with inbuilt dynamo, while the FG was a dynamo similarly combined with an FW four-speed. An SG &#x27;Super-Wide&#x27; three-speed Dynohub was planned between 1954 and 1960, but never produced. An FG hub can be converted to have 5 gears using the same methods of modification as would be used for an FW to enable individually selectable sun gears.

Hub generators were absent from Sturmey-Archer&#x27;s product range from 1984 until the 2006 introduction of the X-FDD front hub, which combines a 6v, 0.4 A (2.4 W) or 0.5 A (3 W) dynamo with a 70 mm drum brake.

===Modern gear hubs (Sun Race Sturmey-Archer)===
The XRF8, XRD8, XRR8, and XRK8 8-speed hubs entered series production in 2007.

Sun Race Sturmey-Archer have modified the design and manufacture in many respects; compared to the old AW hub, the current three-speed equivalent (SRF3) now has an aluminium alloy shell for lighter weight (a painted-steel shelled &#x27;Steelite&#x27; version is still available, and branded AW). According to Schraner and Brandt, an aluminium alloy shell reduced spoke breakage due to aluminium being softer allowing the spoke to seat into the flange and disperse the stress at the bend in the spoke over a wider area.
The company produced front hub brakes to match such as the 70mm X-FD model, featuring sealed cartridge bearings. 

In 2010 Sturmey-Archer launched a new range of duomatic 2-speed hubs, re-using the S2 name from the late 1960s, these hubs – designated S2 (freewheel), S2C (backpedal brake), and S2K (6 bolt disc brake) – share their general engineering principles with the original S2, but do not share any internal components. They offer a direct gear and an overdrive of 38%, a significant improvement for usability over the &#x27;underdrive&#x27; gear of the original S2.

====Three-speed fixed gear hub====
In 2009 Sun Race Sturmey-Archer re-introduced a three-speed fixed gear hub, the S3X. This gives ratios of 100/75/62.5 (i.e. the top gear is direct drive and the others are geared down from it) and the internals are based on the newest five-speed freewheel hub (in the same way as the original fixed ASC was based on the contemporary FC four-speed hub).

===Other===
Sturmey-Archer made various models of 70 mm and 90 mm drum brakes with both steel and aluminium bodies.

The Sturmey-Archer name was also affixed to the 49 cc two-stroke engine fitted to early Raleigh mopeds, although it was actually a reworking of Vincenti Piatti&#x27;s &quot;Trojan Mini-Motor&quot;, and built by BSA&#x27;s motorcycle operation.

<text>The Engraved Hourglass Nebula (also known as MyCn 18) is a young planetary nebula in the southern constellation Musca. It was discovered by Annie Jump Cannon and Margaret W. Mayall during their work on an extended Henry Draper Catalogue (the catalogue was built between 1918 and 1924). At the time, it was designated simply as a small faint planetary nebula. Much improved telescopes and imaging techniques allowed the hourglass shape of the nebula to be discovered by Romano Coradi and Hugo Schwarz in images taken during 1991–1992 at the European Southern Observatory. It is conjectured that MyCn 18&#x27;s hourglass shape is produced by the expansion of a fast stellar wind within a slowly expanding cloud which is denser near its equator than its poles. The vivid colours given off by the nebula are the result of different &#x27;shells&#x27; of elements being expelled from the dying star, in this case helium, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon. The central star of the nebula is unknown.

The Hourglass Nebula was photographed by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope.

A less-famous &quot;Hourglass Nebula&quot; is located inside the Lagoon Nebula.

<doc id="933783" wikidata="Q1024292" url="?curid=933783" title="Egg Nebula">
<text>The Egg Nebula (also known as RAFGL 2688 and CRL 2688) is a bipolar protoplanetary nebula approximately 3,000 light-years away from Earth. Its peculiar properties were first described in 1975 using data from the 11 μm survey obtained with sounding rocket by Air Force Geophysical Laboratory (AFGL) in 1971 to 1974. (Previously, the object was catalogued by Fritz Zwicky as a pair of galaxies.)
The Egg Nebula&#x27;s defining feature is the series of bright arcs and circles surrounding the central star. A dense layer of gas and dusts enshrouds the central star, blocking its direct light from our view. However, the light from the central star penetrates the thinner regions of this dusty enclosure, illuminating the outer layers of gas to create the arcs seen in this resplendent image (Hubble Site). Spectra of the starlight scattered by the dust reveal that the central star has a spectral type of F5. The photosphere of an F5 star is about 900 K hotter than that of the Sun, but it is still not hot enough to have begun ionizing the nebula. Therefore the Egg Nebula is at a slightly earlier evolutionary stage than the Westbrook Nebula whose spectral type B0 central star has just recently begun to ionize the nebula.

The dusty enclosure around the central star is very likely a disc. The bipolar outflows in the image indicate that the system has angular momentum, which is very likely generated by an accretion disc. In addition, a disc geometry would account for the varying thickness of the enclosure that allows light to escape along the disc&#x27;s axis and illuminate the outer layers of gas, but still blocks it from our direct view along the disc edge. Although dusty discs have been confirmed around several post-AGB objects (S. De Ruyter et al., 2006), a disc around the Egg Nebula is yet to be confirmed.

The Egg Nebula shows strong microwave emission from rotational transitions of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The presence of strong HCN emission indicates that the progenitor AGB star was a carbon star. Millimeter wave spectral lines from 38 molecular species have been detected in the outflow. The CO and HCN spectra have a strong blue-shifted P Cygni absorption feature, and show the presence of a ~100 km/sec high velocity wind inside of the remnant AGB wind (which is expanding at 18 km/sec).

The Egg Nebula was photographed by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.

The Egg Nebula emits polarized light which can also be detected visually by a medium-sized telescope.

<text>The AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am is a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, held annually at Pebble Beach, California, near Carmel. The tournament is usually held during the month of February on two different courses, currently Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course and previously, Monterey Peninsula Country Club.

The event was originally known as the [[Bing Crosby]] National Pro-Amateur, or just the Crosby Clambake. After Crosby&#x27;s death in 1977, the tournament was hosted by his family for eight years. The Crosby name was dropped after the 1985 event, and AT&amp;T Corporation became the title sponsor in 1986. It is organized by the Monterey Peninsula Foundation.

==History==
Founded in 1937, the first National Pro-Am Golf Championship was hosted by entertainer Bing Crosby and Larry Crosby in southern California at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in San Diego County, the event&#x27;s location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, then just 18 holes, with a winner&#x27;s share of $500. A second round was added in 1938 and was played through 1942.

After the war, it resumed in 1947 as a 54-hole event, up the coast on golf courses near Monterey, where it has been played ever since. Beginning that year, it was played at Pebble Beach Golf Links, Cypress Point Club, and Monterey Peninsula Country Club through 1966. The tournament became a 72-hole event in 1958.

In 1967, the new Spyglass Hill replaced Monterey Peninsula CC as the third course (with the exception of 1977, when it returned to MPCC). After 1990, private Cypress Point was dropped by the PGA Tour because it would not admit an African-American member, and was replaced by Poppy Hills in 1991, which hosted through 2009. Poppy Hills was not well received by the players, primarily due to poor drainage, and MPCC returned to the rotation in 2010.

Notable professionals in recent years have included Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Mark O&#x27;Meara, Davis Love III, Jordan Spieth, and Vijay Singh. Notable celebrities have included fan favorite Bill Murray, Glenn Frey, Kevin Costner, Steve Young, George Lopez, Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, Kenny G, Justin Timberlake, Ray Romano, Clay Walker, and Carson Daly. Past celebrities included many Hollywood legends, some of whom were accomplished amateur golfers. Jim Backus, best known as the voice of Mr. Magoo and as Thurston Howell III on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, made the 36-hole pro-am cut in 1964.

When Gene Littler won the 1975 event, he was the first player who had been on a winning amateur team in this pro-am (which he had done as a 23-year-old in 1954) to have gone on to win it as a pro.

==Current playing format==

The starting field consists of 80 professionals and 80 amateurs. Each professional is paired with an amateur partner. On the first two days, 80 two-person teams will play a Better ball format with one round on Pebble Beach and the other round at Spyglass Hill. The pros also play an individual stroke play format. On the last two days, only the pros will advance to the third and final rounds held at Pebble Beach. In addition, there will be fewer celebrities in the pro-am field as well.

==Prior playing format==
Previously, the starting field consisted of 156 professionals and 156 amateurs. Each professional was paired with an amateur player. On the first three days, 156 two-man teams played a better ball format with one round on each of the three courses. The pros also played an individual stroke play format. On the final day, those professionals and pro-am teams making the 54-hole cut played on the Pebble Beach Golf Links.

*Individual pro cut: At 54 holes, the low 60 scorers plus any ties. Players between 61st and 70th (and ties) received both official money and FedEx Cup points, as the cut for this tournament ensured the field was smaller than a standard tournament cut of 70 to accommodate the pro-am teams playing on the last day. They were indicated as MDF (made cut, did not finish); this designation was used in other PGA Tour events when more than 78 players made the cut and the field was reduced to 70 and ties after the third round.
*Pro-Am cut: At 54 holes, the low 25 teams, plus any ties.

Only professionals competed in the individual competition part of the tournament. Amateurs were restricted to playing only in the pro-amateur team competition. The local Pebble Beach tournament officials organized the pairing of professionals with amateurs, while the PGA Tour managed the assignment of the pros&#x27; tee times.

==Professional field==
The professional field consists of 80 players under the PGA Tour&#x27;s Signature Events rankings.

# &quot;Top 50&quot;: The 50 players who qualified for the BMW Championship at the end of last year&#x27;s PGA Tour season.
# &quot;Aon Next 10&quot;: Players 51–60 in the final points list of the previous season (includes points from the FedEx Fall from the Procore Championship to The RSM Classic)
# &quot;Aon Swing 5&quot;: The top five players who scored the most FedEx Cup points in the Sony Open in Hawaii, The American Express, and Farmers Insurance Open &quot;provided&quot; they are neither a Top 50 or Aon Next 10 player.
# &quot;Current Year Full-Field Winners&quot;: Winners of The Sentry, Sony Open in Hawaii, The American Express, and Farmers Insurance Open of the current season. 
# &quot;Rankings&quot;: Top 30 Official World Golf Ranking players who are PGA Tour members.
# Up to four sponsor exemptions.
# Should a player who is in the Top 50 not be in good standing with the PGA Tour, then the 51st place player (and so forth) from after the FedEx St. Jude Championship that did not qualify for the BMW Championship shall be a member of the Top 50 until the eligibility list officially has the Top 50. This will also affect the Aon Next 10 list.
# If, after sponsor exemptions, there are fewer than 80 players in the field, players 61st and beyond from the final points list of the previous season will be used to fill the field to 80.

==Format==
Conducted as a planned 72-hole pro-am event, 1958–present. Exceptions are as follows:

* 18 holes: 1937
* 36 holes (planned): 1938 to 1942
* 36 holes, due to bad weather: 1952
* 54 holes (planned): 1947 to 1951, 1953 to 1957
* 54 holes, due to bad weather: 1974, 1981, 1986, 1998, 1999, 2009 and 2024
** In 1996, the first 36 holes were played as scheduled on Thursday and Friday. Rain on Saturday and Sunday prevented the completion of the tournament and it was canceled (54 holes required to be official due to three course setup).
** In 1998, weather conditions prevented the tournament from being finished on schedule (9 holes were played Thursday, 9 on Friday, 18 on Saturday, rain Sunday and Monday). The third round was delayed until August to prevent cancellation similar to 1996. 43 of 168 players withdrew rather than return for the final round.
* No pro-am: 2021
** In 2021, the pro-am section of the tournament was postponed due to safety concerns in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic; as a result Monterey Peninsula was also removed from the course rotation. The amateurs participated in their own tournament during the PURE Insurance Championship PGA Tour Champions event at Pebble Beach in September.
** In 2023, the pro-am competition was shortened to 54 holes due to high winds on Saturday, February 4; professionals only competed in the final round on Monday, February 5.

==Criticism==
Despite being one of the most iconic events on the PGA Tour, many top players tend to skip the event, citing long rounds, celebrity distractions, sketchy weather and the bumpy poa annua greens. In addition, the schedule also made it difficult for players to compete in the event as it was usually the same week as the Saudi International, which also featured a strong field (mainly catered for by large appearance fees). The few top players who did compete regularly at Pebble Beach such as Jordan Spieth, were contractually obligated to compete there due to sponsorship reasons.

<text>Terry Gou (; born 18 October 1950) is a Taiwanese billionaire businessman and politician. Gou is the founder and former chairman and chief executive officer of Foxconn, the world&#x27;s largest contract manufacturer of electronics. Founded in 1974, Foxconn grew to become an international business empire, becoming the largest private employer and exporter in mainland China with a workforce of 1.2 million. As of 2024, Gou had a net worth of billion.

Beginning in 2016, speculation surrounding Gou&#x27;s political ambitions arose ahead of the 2020 presidential election. In 2019, Gou resigned from Foxconn and joined the Kuomintang (KMT) to run for president, declaring he was instructed by the sea goddess Mazu in a dream to contest the election. Gou ultimately lost the election, coming in second in the Kuomintang primary. After leaving the party following the 2019 primary, Gou rejoined in 2023 and announced his intention to run for president in the 2024 presidential election, but after running as an independent candidate, he ended his campaign in late November 2023. 

Once described as an &quot;old friend&quot; by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Gou has been characterized as friendly to Mainland business interests during his political and business career. In December 2022, Gou was credited with helping to successfully lobby the Xi Jinping Administration to ease zero-COVID rules implemented during the pandemic. On foreign policy, Gou has criticized the Taiwan independence movement and has called for a deescalation of Sino–American tensions. Owing to his business background and image as a political outsider, Gou has been compared in international media to U.S. president Donald Trump.

==Early life==
Gou was born in Banqiao Township, Taipei County (now Banqiao District, New Taipei). His parents lived in mainland China&#x27;s Shanxi Province before the Chinese Civil War and fled to Taiwan in 1949. His father was a policeman who fought on behalf of the Kuomintang during the war.

As the second child of his family, Gou received education from elementary school to post college. After graduation, he continued to work in a rubber factory, working at a grinding wheel, and medicine plant until the age of 24. Gou has an older sister and two younger brothers, Gou Tai-chiang and Tony Gou, who have both become successful businesspeople as well.

Gou fulfilled his national service obligations by joining the Republic of China Air Force as an anti-aircraft artillery officer. As part of the airforce, he was stationed in Kinmen at a time when a potential People&#x27;s Liberation Army invasion of the island as a stepping stone to invade Taiwan was a real fear. He would be discharged in 1973.

==Foxconn==
Terry Gou founded Foxconn, established as Hon Hai Precision Industry (鴻海科技集團) in Taiwan in 1974 with $7,500 ($44,000 in 2021 US dollars) in startup money and a workforce of ten elderly employees. The company started off making plastic parts for television sets in a rented shed in Tucheng, a suburb of Taipei. A turning point came in 1980 when he received an order from Atari to make the console joystick. 

Gou expanded his business in the 1980s by embarking on an 11-month trip across the US in search of customers. An aggressive salesman, Gou arrived uninvited at many companies&#x27; headquarters; often, he won orders despite security being called on him.

In 1988, Gou opened his first factory in Shenzhen where his largest factory remains today. Gou scaled up production by integrating vertically the assembly process and facilities for workers. The manufacturing site became a campus that included housing, dining, medical care and burial for the workers, and even chicken farming to supply the cafeteria.

In 1996, Hon Hai started building chassis for Compaq desktops. This was a breakthrough moment that led to building the bare bones chassis for other high-profile customers, including HP, IBM, and Apple. Within just a few years, Foxconn grew into a consumer electronics giant.

== Other business ventures ==
In 2019, Gou argued that Apple should move its manufacturing out of mainland China to Taiwan. The comments came after he confirmed he will step down from his role as Foxconn chairman.

Gou is also the main owner of HMD Global, which is a company founded in 2016 to sell Nokia branded phones. HMD buys the R&amp;D, manufacturing and distribution from FIH Ltd, which is part of Hon Hai group.

In April 2021, Gou became the biggest shareholder in the biotech company Eirgenix. In December 2022, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a letter from Gou helped convince the Chinese government to ease Zero-COVID restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Political career==
Gou first joined the Kuomintang in 1970, but allowed his membership to lapse after 2000. In the 2012 Taiwan presidential election, Gou endorsed Ma Ying-jeou, stating that Ma was an &quot;experienced, outstanding helmsman.&quot; After Donald Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election, Gou was the subject of a spoof open letter in &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, in which author Tim Culpan was severely critical of Trump. The article was mistakenly reported as having been written by Gou himself.

=== Political views ===
An opponent of the Taiwan independence movement, Gou claims the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) &quot;exalts Taiwan independence and hates and opposes China&quot;. His position is that Taiwan independence is not an issue. Instead, he supports the 1992 Consensus under the one-China framework, and has criticized the DPP for political wordplay in their interpretation of the consensus.

In 2019, Gou expressed misgivings about the legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan, arguing that the Legislative Yuan did not respect the results of the 2018 referendum where a majority voted against legalization.

=== 2020 presidential election ===
From 2016, it was widely reported that Gou was considering a 2020 Taiwanese presidential bid, and speculation continued into 2017. He rejoined the Kuomintang in April 2019. On 17 April 2019, Gou announced his intention to run in the Kuomintang primary for the 2020 presidential election. 

Gou declared that he had been instructed by the sea goddess Mazu in a dream to run as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election of the Republic of China. He finished second in the 2019 Kuomintang presidential primary, with 27.7% of the vote. On 12 September 2019, Gou announced his withdrawal from the Kuomintang. Four days later, Gou stated that he would not participate in the 2020 presidential election as an independent candidate. Gou was offered the top position on the Taiwan People&#x27;s Party party list for the 2020 legislative election, but declined such a bid.

=== 2024 presidential election ===
In April 2023, Gou announced he would run for President in the Taiwanese 2024 general election. Polling conducted in January 2023 found him in second place in a hypothetical KMT primary with Hou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei, receiving 28.6% of the vote versus Hou&#x27;s 36.7%. Gou formally declared his independent presidential bid on August 28. On September 2, Foxconn announced that Gou had resigned his position on the board of directors for personal reasons.

On 14 September 2023, Gou announced as his running mate the actress and writer , also known as Tammy Lai.

Gou officially qualified for the presidential election on 14 November 2023, when the signatures he had collected in order to run as an independent candidate were validated by Taiwan&#x27;s Central Election Commission. However, on 24 November 2023 he announced he was dropping out of the presidential race, and his name would not appear on the ballot.

== Public image ==
Gou&#x27;s status as a billionaire businessman and relative political outsider, Gou was compared to Trump in international media during his 2019 presidential candidacy. 

In 2007, Gou cited Genghis Khan as a personal hero. Gou reportedly wears a beaded bracelet procured at a temple dedicated to the Genghis Khan, which he wears on his right wrist.

=== &quot;Animal&quot; management comment controversy ===
In 2012, a controversy arose after Gou jokingly compared Foxconn&#x27;s workforce to animals during a company event at the Taipei zoo. The &quot;Xinhua News Agency&quot; reported that while speaking on the challenges of presiding over a workforce with over one million employees, Gou stated that as &quot;human beings are also animals, to manage one million animals gives me a headache.&quot;

Foxconn defended Gou&#x27;s comments, stating that &quot;Mr. Gou did say that, since all humans are members of the animal kingdom, it might be possible to learn from Mr. Chin’s experience as his team looks for lessons that can be applied to business.&quot; Moreover, Foxconn clarified that Gou&#x27;s comments were not discriminatory, explaining that &quot;Mr. Gou’s comments were directed at all humans and not at any specific group&quot;.

=== Anti-Korean comment ===
In June 2012, Gou stated that he had &quot;great esteem for Japanese (businessmen), especially those who are able to disagree with you in person and not stab you in the back, unlike the &quot;Gaoli bangzi&quot;&quot;. &quot;Gaoli bangzi&quot; is a racial slur for Korean people.

== Personal life ==
Gou and his first wife, Serena Lin (; 1950–2005), have a son who works in the film and real estate industries and a daughter who worked in the financial sector. Gou founded an educational charity with Lin in 2000 and intended to eventually give away one third of his wealth to charity. After Gou&#x27;s wife died, Gou&#x27;s daughter assumed leadership in the charity.

In the 1990s, Gou had an extramarital affair with Chen Chung-mei, a bar girl according to Gou, who had a private investigator videotape her and Gou having sex in order to blackmail Gou for money. While Gou first agreed to pay the money, when they next met he had police arrest Chen and the private investigator, Hsu Ching-wei, and sued them for extortion, stating he knew the affair would become &quot;exposed one way or another&quot;.

In 2002, he bought a castle near Kutná Hora in the Czech Republic for $30 million.

In 2005, Serena Lin died of breast cancer at the age of 55. Gou&#x27;s younger brother, Tony Gou, died in 2007 of leukemia. Also that year, Hsu Ching-wei accused Gou of having an affair during the 1990s. Gou married his second wife, choreographer (born 1974) on 26 July 2008. Tseng and Gou have three children. Together, they have decided to give 90% of Gou&#x27;s wealth away.

=== Wealth ===
In 2016, Gou&#x27;s net worth was US$5.6 billion. By August 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed his net worth at US$10.6 billion. As of 2022, Gou had a net worth of billion, making him the sixth wealthiest person in Taiwan.

<doc id="933803" wikidata="Q3242084" url="?curid=933803" title="Castaic, California">
<text>Castaic () (Chumash: &quot;Kaštiq&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Castéc&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) in the northwestern part of Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 19,015. 

Tens of thousands of motorists pass through Castaic daily as they drive to or from Los Angeles on Interstate 5 (the Golden State Freeway). Castaic Lake is part of the California Water Project and is the site of a hydro-electric power plant. Castaic is northwest of Los Angeles Union Station and northwest of the city of Santa Clarita.

The Castaic Range War went on for decades in the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulting in dozens of deaths before hostilities ceased in 1916.

==Name==
The name Castaic is derived from the Chumash word &quot;Kaštiq&quot;, meaning &quot;the eye&quot;. The Spanish and Mexicans later spelt the name in Spanish as &quot;Castéc&quot;. Castec is first mentioned on old boundary maps of Rancho San Francisco, as a canyon at the trailhead leading to the old Chumash camp at Castac Lake (Tejon Ranch), which is intermittently wet and briny. Early publications in English spelled it &quot;Casteque&quot; before the current spelling became standardized.

==History==
The Córdova family of California were the first settlers in the area. Modern Castaic began in 1887 when Southern Pacific set up a railroad siding on the line between Piru and Saugus Station, naming it &quot;Castaic Junction&quot;. Between January and April 1890, the Castec School District adopted the new spelling, &quot;Castaic&quot;.

===Range War===
Between 1890 and 1916, the Castaic Range War was fought in Castaic country over ranch boundaries and grazing rights. It was the biggest range war in U.S. history.

A feud started over Section 23, where the Stonegate subdivision is now. William Chormicle had legally bought the property, but William &quot;Wirt&quot; Jenkins was already storing grain on it and said he had filed for ownership. During a heated dispute, Chormicle and a friend shot and killed two of Jenkins&#x27;s cowhands. They were acquitted in court.

Jenkins, however, was the local justice of the peace, with friends of his own, and the feud quickly grew into war. Former Los Angeles Rangers (among whom Jenkins had fought) and other notables were drawn in. The war claimed dozens of lives and foiled a negotiator, a forest ranger whom President Theodore Roosevelt had sent in to quell it.

===Cattle business===
Castaic has the last traditional cattle roundup—with horses, lariats, and branding irons—in Los Angeles County. It has been held by the Cordova family since 1834, when the family first settled here. Members of the Cordova family were scouts for the U.S. Army during the Mexican War in 1846 and helped identify bodies during the St. Francis Dam disaster in San Francisquito Canyon in 1928. Operations scaled back in 1967 when the government seized around , including the ancestral ranch-house, for the planned Castaic Lake and dam.

<doc id="933806" wikidata="Q1072900" url="?curid=933806" title="Space bar">
<text>The space bar, spacebar, blank, or space key, is a key on a typewriter or alphanumeric keyboard in the form of a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, significantly wider than all other keys. Its main purpose is to conveniently enter a space, e.g., between words during typing.

==History==
Originally, (on early writers dating back to the late 19th century) the &quot;bar&quot; was literally a metal bar running across the full width of the keyboard (or even wider, and even surrounding it) that triggered the carriage advance without also firing any of the typebars towards the platen. Later examples gradually shrank and developed into their current more ergonomic form as a wide, centrally located but otherwise apparently normal &quot;key&quot;, as typewriter (and computer) keyboards began to incorporate additional function keys and were more deliberately &quot;styled&quot;. Although it varies by keyboard type, the space bar usually lies between the Alt key (or Command keys on Macintosh keyboards) and below the letter keys: C, V, B, N and M on a standard QWERTY keyboard. In some keyboards, both physical and specially virtual ones, the symbol is used to label the space bar.

Some early typewriter and particularly computer keyboards used a different method of inserting spaces, typically a smaller, less distinct &quot;space&quot; key which was also often set in a less central position, e.g. the Hansen Writing Ball, Hammond typewriters or the ZX Spectrum and Jupiter Ace ranges. The earliest known example, Sholes and Glidden typewriter used a lever to provide space between words, placing the invention of the inset space bar after 1843. However these methods were also usually just one part of similarly idiosyncratic full keyboard layouts, designed more to cope with particular technical requirements or limitations than with any sense of user friendliness and as such met with limited success, sometimes being dropped even on later models in the same line (e.g. Sinclair Spectrum 128k and &quot;Plus&quot; lines, which adopted more &quot;normally styled&quot; keyboards with plastic keytops and a wide, central space bar in place of the earlier rubber &quot;chiclet&quot; keys and small, offset space key).

==Other uses==
Depending on the operating system, the space bar used with a modifier key such as the control key may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or even backspacing. On web browsers, the space bar usually allows the user to page down or to page up when the space bar is used with the Shift key. 

In many programs for playback of linear media (such as videos or music), the space bar is used for pausing and resuming playback, or for manually advancing through text.

In video games where the playable character can move and jump, the default key to jump is usually the space bar. This is usually used along with the WASD keys for up, down, left and right movement.

<doc id="933831" wikidata="Q3242416" url="?curid=933831" title="Return statement">
<text>In computer programming, a return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after the instruction which called the subroutine, known as its return address. The return address is saved by the calling routine, today usually on the process&#x27;s call stack or in a register. Return statements in many programming languages allow a function to specify a return value to be passed back to the code that called the function.

== Overview ==
In C and C++, codice_1 (where codice_2 is an expression) is a statement that tells a function to return execution of the program to the calling function, and report the value of codice_2. If a function has the return type void, the return statement can be used without a value, in which case the program just breaks out of the current function and returns to the calling one. Similar syntax is used in other languages including Modula-2 and Python.

In Pascal there is no return statement. Functions or procedures automatically return when reaching their last statement. The return value from a function is provided within the function by making an assignment to an identifier with the same name as the function. However, some versions of Pascal provide a special function codice_4 that can be used to return a value immediately from a function, or, without parameters, to return immediately from a procedure.

Like Pascal, FORTRAN II, Fortran 66, Fortran 77, and later versions of Fortran specify return values by an assignment to the function name, but also have a return statement; that statement does not specify a return value and, for a function, causes the value assigned to the function name to be returned.

In some other languages a user defined output parameter is used instead of the function identifier.

Oberon (Oberon-07) has a return clause instead of a return statement. The return clause is placed after the last statement of the procedure body.

Some expression-oriented programming language, such as Lisp, Perl and Ruby, allow the programmer to omit an explicit return statement, specifying instead that the last evaluated expression is the return value of the subroutine. In other cases a Null value is returned if there is no explicit return statement: in Python, the value codice_5 is returned when the return statement is omitted, while in JavaScript the value codice_6 is returned.

In Windows PowerShell all evaluated expressions which are not captured (e.g., assigned to a variable, cast to void or piped to $null) are returned from the subroutine as elements in an array, or as a single object in the case that only one object has not been captured.

In Perl, a return value or values of a subroutine can depend on the context in which it was called. The most fundamental distinction is a scalar context where the calling code expects one value, a list context where the calling code expects a list of values and a void context where the calling code doesn&#x27;t expect any return value at all. A subroutine can check the context using the codice_7 function. A special syntax of return without arguments is used to return an undefined value in scalar context and an empty list in list context. The scalar context can be further divided into Boolean, number, string, and various reference types contexts. Also, a context-sensitive object can be returned using a contextual return sequence, with lazy evaluation of scalar values.

Many operating systems let a program return a result (separate from normal output) when its process terminates; these values are referred to exit statuses. The amount of information that can be passed this way is quite limited, in practice often restricted to signalling success or fail. From within the program this return is typically achieved by calling Exit (system call) (common even in C, where the alternative mechanism of returning from the main function is available).

==Syntax==
Return statements come in many shapes. The following syntaxes are most common:

In some assembly languages, for example that for the MOS Technology 6502, the mnemonic &quot;RTS&quot; (ReTurn from Subroutine) is used.

== Multiple return statements ==
Languages with an explicit return statement create the possibility of multiple return statements in the same function. Whether or not that is a good thing is controversial.

Strong adherents of structured programming make sure each function has a single entry and a single exit (SESE). It has thus been argued that one should eschew the use of the explicit return statement except at the textual end of a subroutine, considering that, when it is used to &quot;return early&quot;, it may suffer from the same sort of problems that arise for the GOTO statement. Conversely, it can be argued that using the return statement is worthwhile when the alternative is more convoluted code, such as deeper nesting, harming readability. 

In his 2004 textbook, David Watt writes that &quot;single-entry multi-exit control flows are often desirable&quot;. Using Tennent&#x27;s framework notion of sequencer, Watt uniformly describes the control flow constructs found in contemporary programming languages and attempts to explain why certain types of sequencers are preferable to others in the context of multi-exit control flows. Watt writes that unrestricted gotos (jump sequencers) are bad because the destination of the jump is not self-explanatory to the reader of a program until the reader finds and examines the actual label or address that is the target of the jump. In contrast, Watt argues that the conceptual intent of a return sequencer is clear from its own context, without having to examine its destination. Furthermore, Watt writes that a class of sequencers known as &quot;escape sequencers&quot;, defined as &quot;sequencer that terminates execution of a textually enclosing command or procedure&quot;, encompasses both breaks from loops (including multi-level breaks) and return statements. Watt also notes that while jump sequencers (gotos) have been somewhat restricted in languages like C, where the target must be an inside the local block or an encompassing outer block, that restriction alone is not sufficient to make the intent of gotos in C self-describing and so they can still produce &quot;spaghetti code&quot;. Watt also examines how exception sequencers differ from escape and jump sequencers; for details on this see the article on structured programming.

According to empirical studies cited by Eric S. Roberts, student programmers had difficulty formulating correct solutions for several simple problems in a language like Pascal, which does not allow multiple exit points. For the problem of writing a function to linearly searching an element in an array, a 1980 study by Henry Shapiro (cited by Roberts) found that using only the Pascal-provided control structures, the correct solution was given by only 20% of the subjects, while no subject wrote incorrect code for this problem if allowed to write a return from the middle of a loop. 

Others, including Kent Beck and Martin Fowler argue that one or more guard clauses—conditional &quot;early exit&quot; return statements near the beginning of a function—often make a function easier to read than the alternative.

The most common problem in early exit is that cleanup or final statements are not executed – for example, allocated memory is not unallocated, or open files are not closed, causing leaks. These must be done at each return site, which is brittle and can easily result in bugs. For instance, in later development, a return statement could be overlooked by a developer, and an action which should be performed at the end of a subroutine (e.g. a trace statement) might not be performed in all cases. Languages without a return statement, such as standard Pascal don&#x27;t have this problem. Some languages, such as C++ and Python, employ concepts which allow actions to be performed automatically upon return (or exception throw) which mitigates some of these issues – these are often known as &quot;try/finally&quot; or similar. Functionality like these &quot;finally&quot; clauses can be implemented by a goto to the single return point of the subroutine. An alternative solution is to use the normal stack unwinding (variable deallocation) at function exit to unallocate resources, such as via destructors on local variables, or similar mechanisms such as Python&#x27;s &quot;with&quot; statement.

Some early implementations of languages such as the original Pascal and C restricted the types that can be returned by a function (e.g. not supporting record or struct types) to simplify their compilers.

In Java—and similar languages modeled after it, like JavaScript—it is possible to execute code even after return statement, because the &quot;finally&quot; block of a try-catch structure is always executed. So if the &quot;return&quot; statement is placed somewhere within &quot;try&quot; or &quot;catch&quot; blocks the code within &quot;finally&quot; (if added) will be executed. It is even possible to alter the return value of a non primitive type (a property of an already returned object) because the exit occurs afterwards as well.

==Yield statements==
Cousin to return statements are yield statements: where a return causes a &quot;sub&quot;routine to &quot;terminate,&quot; a yield causes a &quot;co&quot;routine to &quot;suspend.&quot; The coroutine will later continue from where it suspended if it is called again. Coroutines are significantly more involved to implement than subroutines, and thus yield statements are less common than return statements, but they are found in a number of languages.

==Call/return sequences==
A number of possible call/return sequences are possible depending on the hardware instruction set, including the following:
# The codice_8 instruction pushes address of the next instruction on the stack and branches to the specified address. The codice_9 instruction pops the return address from the stack into the instruction pointer and execution resumes at that address. (Examples: x86, PDP-11) In architectures such as the Motorola 96000, the stack area may be allocated in a separate address space, which is called &#x27;Stack Memory Space&#x27;, distinct from the main memory address space. The NEC μPD7720 also features a stack with its own separate address space.
# The codice_8 instruction places address of the next instruction in a register and branches to the specified address. The codice_9 instruction sequence places the return address from the register into the instruction pointer and execution resumes at that address. (Examples: IBM System/360 and successors through z/Architecture, most RISC architectures)
# The codice_8 instruction places address of the next (or current) instruction in the storage location at the call address and branches to the specified address+1. The codice_9 instruction sequence branches to the return address by an indirect jump to the first instruction of the subroutine. (Examples: IBM 1130, SDS 9XX, PDP-8)

<doc id="933834" wikidata="Q583531" url="?curid=933834" title="MOS Technology 6522">
<text>The MOS Technology 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA) is an integrated circuit that was designed and manufactured by MOS Technology as an I/O port controller for the 6502 family of microprocessors. It provides two bidirectional 8-bit parallel I/O ports, two 16-bit timers (one of which can also operate as an event counter), and an 8-bit shift register for serial communications or data conversion between serial and parallel forms. The direction of each bit of the two I/O ports can be individually programmed. In addition to being manufactured by MOS Technology, the 6522 was second sourced by other companies including Rockwell and Synertek.

The 6522 was widely used in computers of the 1980s, particularly Commodore&#x27;s machines, and was also a central part of the designs of the Apple III, Oric-1 and Oric Atmos, BBC Micro, Victor 9000/Sirius 1 and Apple Macintosh. Video game platforms such as the Vectrex also used the 6522, as did the 1984 through 1989 Corvette digital dash cluster. A high speed, CMOS version, the W65C22, is produced by the Western Design Center (WDC).

==Input/output ports==
The VIA contains 20 I/O lines, which are organised into two 8-bit bidirectional ports (or 16 general-purpose I/O lines) and four control lines (for handshaking and interrupt generation). The directions for all 16 general lines (PA0-7, PB0-7) can be programmed independently. The control lines can be programmed to generate an interrupt when activated (all four), latch the corresponding I/O port (CA1 and CB1), automatically generate handshaking signals for devices on the I/O ports, or operate as plain program-controlled outputs (CA2 and CB2). CB1 and CB2 are also used as the clock input and the data line for the shift register, precluding their use for other functions while the shift register is enabled.

==Timers==
The VIA provides two 16-bit timer/counters. Each can be used in one-shot (monostable) &quot;interval timer&quot; mode; timer 1 can also be used in &quot;free-running&quot; (divider/square wave) mode, in which the timer is automatically reloaded with the initial count when it reaches zero, and timer 2 can also be used in &quot;pulse counting&quot; mode, in which the timer will count the high-to-low state transitions of pin PB6 (the 7th bit of parallel I/O port B). In the one-shot mode, each timer continues free-running so that the time since zero was reached can be determined, but no further interrupt is issued until the timer is restarted. Each timer can generate an interrupt when it reaches zero, and timer 1 can also output pulses (in the interval timer mode) or square waves (in the free-running mode) on pin PB7 (the 8th bit of port B). Timer 2 can be used to provide the clock frequency for the shift register. A useful feature of the free-running mode is that the 16-bit counter latch can be loaded with a new count without reloading the counter, so that it will load the new count only after the current count reaches zero, seamlessly changing the output frequency. This feature of timer 1, combined with its ability to output to pin PB7, can be used to generate complex waveforms, for example pulse-width modulation signals, frequency sweeps, or bi-phase or FM-encoded serial bit streams.

==Shift register==
The VIA&#x27;s shift register is bidirectional, 8 bits wide, and can run from either a timer-generated clock (from timer 2), the CPU clock, or an external source on line CB1. The serial input/output is on line , and can also be programmed to output a bit clock for external clocked serial devices.

==IRQ output==
The NMOS 6522 has an open drain IRQ output that may be used in wired-OR interrupt circuits. The WDC W65C22S, in contrast, has a totem pole IRQ output that must be isolated from a wired-OR circuit by a Schottky diode, due to the fact that the totem pole output actively drives the IRQ pin high when the W65C22S is not interrupting. This specific issue is resolved on the WDC W65C22N which is fitted with an open-drain IRQ output.

== Bugs ==

Due to a design defect, if the edge on falls within a few nanoseconds of the falling edge of the ϕ2 (phase–2) clock, the will be ignored, causing the loss of a bit and framing errors on subsequent data. 

A workaround is put the external clock signal into the input of a 74ACT74 flip-flop, run the flop&#x27;s output to the 6522&#x27;s pin, and clock the flip-flop with ϕ0 or ϕ2.

The serial shift register bug was corrected in the California Micro Devices CMD G65SC22 and in the MOS 6526, the latter device which Commodore used in place of the 6522 from the Commodore 64 onwards.

Aside from the aforementioned shift register bug, there was a potential register corruption problem that usually only occurred in systems using the 6522 with a microprocessor having a non-6502 bus architecture, such as a Motorola 68000. If the address lines changed while chip select was low (inactive) but the ϕ2 clock input was high (active), register contents could be changed despite the fact that the chip was not selected. This was fixed in some but not all of the CMOS versions.

<text>James Douglas Johnson (August 20, 1924 – February 13, 2010), known as &quot;Justice Jim&quot; Johnson, was an Arkansas legislator and jurist known for outspoken support of racial segregation during the mid-20th century. He served as an associate justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court from 1959 to 1966, and in the Arkansas Senate from 1951 to 1957. Johnson unsuccessfully sought several elected positions, including Governor of Arkansas in 1956 and 1966, the United States Senate in 1968, and Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1976, 1980, and 1984. A segregationist, Johnson was frequently compared to George Wallace of Alabama. He joined the Republican Party in 1983.

==Early life and career==
Johnson was a native of Crossett in southern Arkansas near the Louisiana state line. He was the son of T. W. and Myrtle Johnson, who owned and operated a grocery store in the sawmill town. During World War II, Johnson was drafted into the United States Marine Corps, serving in the Pacific Theater. After the war, Johnson attended Cumberland University, married Conway-native Virginia Lillian Morris, and returned to Crossett to start a law practice. She would serve as his legal secretary for the rest of her life.

Johnson was said to have admired the political style of Huey Long, but was to Long&#x27;s political right. His interest in politics grew following the 1948 Democratic National Convention and formation of the Dixiecrat party. When former Governor of Arkansas Benjamin T. Laney recommended Johnson run for office, he sought the District 27 seat in the Arkansas Senate, which covered Ashley and Chicot counties. He was seated in the 58th Arkansas General Assembly.

Following the United States Supreme Court &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision in 1954, Johnson sought to use segregation as a wedge issue for many campaigns thereafter. He brought the Citizens&#x27; Councils to Arkansas to stoke the white backlash created in the wake of Brown v. Board, and seized on the pending integration of Hoxie School District as a hot-button issue ahead of the 1956 gubernatorial election. Johnson also drafted and flogged an interposition amendment to the Arkansas Constitution and used red-baiting to raise the temperature around integration in Hoxie and raise his public profile.

In 1956, Johnson declined to run for another term in the legislature, instead seeking to challenge incumbent Governor Orval Faubus in the Democratic primary during the Solid South period, in which winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to election. Johnson accused the segregationist Faubus of working behind the scenes for racial integration, but finished a distant second with 83,856 votes (26.9%) Faubus went on to handily defeat Republican Roy Mitchell in the 1956 gubernatorial election for a second two-year term as governor.

Being a staunch and lifelong segregationist, in 1955, in response to school integration occurring in Hoxie, Johnson proposed an amendment to the Arkansas constitution that would prohibit integration. Johnson also played a role in the Little Rock Nine crisis. He claimed to have hoaxed Governor Faubus into calling out the National Guard, supposedly to prevent a white mob from stopping the integration of Little Rock Central High School: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t any caravan. But we made Orval believe it. We said. &#x27;They&#x27;re lining up. They&#x27;re coming in droves.&#x27; ... The only weapon we had was to leave the impression that the sky was going to fall.&quot; He later claimed that Faubus asked him to raise a mob to justify his actions. He was elected to the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1958 and served until 1966, when he resigned to run again for governor.

==Campaigns of 1966 and 1968==

Johnson made four more bids for office, all unsuccessful. In 1968, he sought the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in the Democratic Primary against J. William Fulbright while his wife, Virginia, sought the Democratic nod in the Governor&#x27;s race to challenge the reelection of 1966 foe Rockefeller. Both lost, yet Johnson headed the third party effort of former Alabama Governor George Wallace while running for the Senate as a Democrat. In 1972, he lent key support to Senator John McLellan in a tight runoff against Representative David Pryor. He passed on a second run against Fulbright in 1974, opting instead to support the comeback bid of Orval Faubus for Governor, which he lost to Pryor.

In 1976, he unsuccessfully challenged the re-election bid of Chief Justice Carleton Harris of the Arkansas Supreme Court, but lost with 44% of the vote. In 1980, expressing alarm that Pulaski County Circuit Judge Richard Adkisson, who Johnson considered too liberal, would succeed Harris as Chief Justice, Johnson mounted a petition drive to get on the ballot as an Independent, but fell short of the required signatures. Adkisson won the Democratic primary and was unopposed in the general election. 

After his son, Mark Johnson, was appointed to the cabinet of Governor Frank White (a Republican), Johnson hinted he would switch parties. In 1983 he did so and ran as the GOP nominee for Chief Justice in 1984, but lost by a 58-42% margin to Jack Holt, Jr., a nephew of Frank Holt, whom Johnson had defeated for the gubernatorial nomination in 1966.

==Later years==
In the 1982, Jim and Virginia Johnson supported the re-election of Governor Frank D. White, Arkansas&#x27; second Republican governor since Reconstruction. White, however, was unseated by Bill Clinton, after a single term. Johnson had a long-standing enmity with Clinton. While he had been a student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., Clinton was a campaign aide for Johnson&#x27;s 1966 runoff opponent, Judge Frank Holt. Twelve years later, Clinton would win the governorship. In reference to Johnson&#x27;s overtly racist views and dirty campaign tactics, Clinton once told Johnson, &quot;You make me ashamed to be from Arkansas.&quot; Years later, Johnson replied that he was ashamed Arkansas had produced &quot;a president of the United States who is a queer-mongering, whore-hopping adulterer; a baby-killing, draft-dodging, dope-tolerating, lying, two-faced, treasonous activist.&quot; He also appeared in Jerry Falwell’s &quot;The Clinton Chronicles&quot; and was a paid consultant for the Arkansas Project.

During the Whitewater controversy, Johnson made accusations against Clinton based on a continuing opposition research campaign conducted by Republican political consultants, Floyd Brown and David Bossie. A client of Johnson&#x27;s, David Hale, a former municipal court judge, was the special prosecutor&#x27;s chief witness attempting to link Clinton to the Whitewater scandal. Hale&#x27;s testimony was deemed to have been of no import, as he had agreed to testify under plea bargaining to secure a better deal on his own indictment for fraud.

Unlike George Wallace, who repented of his segregationist past, Johnson doubled-down during his 1966 campaign for Governor, infamously refused to shake hands with black voters. Endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, he campaigned against &quot;mongrelization&quot; — a stance for which he never apologized. In 1996, he said: &quot;I have to admit that I have not grown to the point where I am not uncomfortable when I see a mixed couple. It causes me discomfort. But I say in the same breath that when I see a drunk it causes me discomfort.&quot;

==Death==
The Faulkner County Sheriff&#x27;s Office reported that Johnson was found dead about 10 a.m. on Saturday, February 13, 2010, at his home off Beaverfork Lake with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. Rice said a rifle was found, and authorities had no reason to suspect foul play. He had been suffering from cancer.

<text>The Stade Vélodrome (), known for sponsorship reasons as the Orange Vélodrome since June 2016, is a multi-purpose stadium in Marseille, France. It is home to the Olympique de Marseille football club of Ligue 1 since it opened in 1937, and has been a venue in the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups; the 1960, 1984 and 2016 editions of the UEFA European Championship; and the 2007 and 2023 Rugby World Cup, and football at the 2024 Summer Olympics. It occasionally hosts RC Toulon rugby club of the Top 14. It is the second largest stadium in France, behind Stade de France in Saint-Denis (Paris), with a capacity of 67,394 spectators. The stadium is also used regularly by the France national rugby union team.

The record attendance for a club game before renovation at the Stade Vélodrome was 58,897 in a UEFA Cup semi-final against Newcastle United in 2004. Since expansion to 67,394, the record attendance at the ground now stands at 65,894 for the match against rivals Paris Saint-Germain that occurred on 26 February 2023. The first-ever match to be played was between Marseille and Torino in 1937.

The French rugby union team began an impressive run of victories at the stadium in the early 2000s. They defeated New Zealand 42–33 in November 2000, and in 2001 defeated Australia by one point. They beat South Africa in 2002, followed by a win over England in 2003. However, their run of luck was broken in 2004 when they lost 14–24 to Argentina. The venue was used by France for a game against New Zealand in November 2009. In 2018, the stadium hosted its first Six Nations match with France hosting Italy.

France is not the only rugby team to have used the Vélodrome in recent years. On 18 April 2009, Toulon took their home fixture in the Top 14 against Toulouse to the Vélodrome, drawing 57,039 spectators to see a 14–6 Toulon win which played a key role in the &quot;Toulonnais&quot;&#x27; successful fight against relegation in the 2008–09 season. Toulon has taken two home matches to the Vélodrome in each of the succeeding two seasons. The Vélodrome was also the venue for both semi-finals in the 2010–11 Top 14 season, and was used for the Toulon v Munster semi-final of the 2013–14 Heineken Cup.

On the 28 May 2022, The Velodrome hosted the 2022 European Rugby Champions Cup Final between La Rochelle v Leinster in front of 59,682 spectators. On 29 June, The Velodrome will host the 2024 Top 14 Final due to the Stade de France being unavailable because of the 2024 Summer Olympics.

The 20th stage of the 2017 Tour de France, an individual time trial through the streets of Marseille, started and finished in the stadium.

== History ==

In 1935, the architectural firm Pollack Ploquin was chosen to build a stadium in Marseille. Henri Ploquin (who designed in 1932 with Charles Bouhana the Stade Municipal Louis Darragon) designed the stadium. For economic reasons, only the Stade Vélodrome was built. On 28 April 1935, the foundation stone was laid for the Vélodrome by Marseille Mayor Ribot, on a site between downtown and the suburban areas of St. Giniez and Sainte-Marguerite on military grounds belonging to the city. The Stade Vélodrome opened on 13 June 1937, when a friendly match was played between Olympique Marseille (OM) and Italian of Torino FC (which ended 2–1 to Olympique Marseille). On 29 August 1937 (the second day of the France national football championship) a match took place between OM and Cannes. This was the first official match at the stadium.

As its name suggests, Stade Vélodrome was used for cycling competitions but as these races became less common, seating replaced the track which circled the stadium. The Vélodrome remained famous for fans of OM (Olympique Marseille) since the sloped track which was under the extended seating acted as a slide to invade the pitch at the end of matches.

Olympique de Marseille was long hostile to the Stade Vélodrome, calling it the &quot;stadium of the City Council&quot;. For fans of the Olympians between the wars, the real home of OM was Stade de l&#x27;Huveaune, owned by Olympique de Marseille and partly financed by fans in the early 1920s. After World War II, however, Marseille no longer owned the Stadium Huveaune. Seeking support from the city, Chairman Marcel Leclerc had OM play at Huveaune from 1945 to 1960. The City Council then relented, and Olympique de Marseille moved to the Vélodrome. During the 1970s, OM shared the Stade with the Marseille XIII Rugby League.

===First renovations===

1970 marked the first modifications to the Vélodrome, with the replacement of the floodlights on the Ganay and Jean-Bouin tribunes by four 60 meter towers for nighttime events. In March 1971, the capacity of the stadium was increased by nearly 6000 seats, with the reduction of the cycling track and the removal of the cinder running track. This brought the total capacity of the stadium to 55,000 people, including the standing area.

Olympique returned to the Stade de l&#x27;Huveaune for the 1982–1983 season as Stade Vélodrome was under construction in preparation for the UEFA Euro 1984. The playing surface was completely replaced during this time. The semifinal between France and Portugal had set a record for attendance at an international match with 54,848 spectators. The capacity of the stadium was later reduced to 42,000 with the construction of lodges.

The cycling track was removed altogether once Bernard Tapie was appointed president of OM in 1985. He chose to remove it and rearrange the corners of the stadium, bringing the capacity up to 48,000. This renovation marked the end of the era of Vélodrome as a multi-use facility. The area around the stadium was also transformed with the creation of the second line of the metro which served the stadium from two stations and with the construction of the Palais des Sports nearby.

===1998 World Cup and beyond===
The Stade Vélodrome was completely renovated for the 1998 World Cup; its capacity increased from 42,000 to 60,031 seats (equivalent to of seats). The Vélodrome hosted the final draw, which took place on 4 December 1997 (the first time the final draw was held in an outdoor venue) and seven matches, including France&#x27;s first match against South Africa, the quarterfinal between Argentina and the Netherlands and the semifinal between Brazil and the Netherlands. As of 2011, the record attendance for a football game (58,897 spectators) was the Newcastle United UEFA Cup semifinal on 6 May 2004 (2–0). During the 2007 Rugby World Cup the Vélodrome hosted six games, including two quarter-finals: Australia versus England (which holds the overall attendance record with 59,120 spectators) and South Africa versus Fiji. On 16 July 2009, during preparations for a Madonna concert, one of four winches used to hoist the structure failed; the 60-ton roof fell (leaving two dead, eight wounded and crushing a crane).

Widely criticized and unloved by the Marseillais for its architecture (no roof, exposure to strong mistral winds and poor acoustics), the Stade Vélodrome has since 2003 been the subject of several projects to modernize and enlarge it. In July 2009, following an extraordinary council of the City of Marseille concerning the City Hall renovation project, a motion was passed launching a public-private partnership (PPP). On 21 June 2010, following France&#x27;s winning bid for UEFA Euro 2016, Marseille announced that the stadium would receive another renovation (a roof and an increase in capacity from 60,031 to 67,000), making it a UEFA Elite Stadium. Works began in the spring of 2011 and were completed in summer 2014.

==Attendance==
In 2002, Division 1 was renamed Ligue 1. Olympique de Marseille&#x27;s average attendance for each season since 2000–01 is listed below:

===2023 Rugby World Cup===


===2024 Summer Olympics===
==Structure==

The four stands in the stadium are named after athletes (runner Jean Bouin and 1920s cyclist Gustave Ganay), a historical figure of the 1720 plague epidemic (Chevalier Roze) and a popular Olympique de Marseille supporter (Patrice De Peretti, nicknamed &quot;Depe&quot;, who died suddenly in July 2000).

==Rugby League==
Other than the Rugby League World Cup games in 1954, 1972 and 1975, 14 other test matches were played at the stadium between 1938 and 1985. The France national team played in 16 of the internationals played at Stade Vélodrome. Four of the five international crowds between 1948 and 1951 constituted full houses of approximately 32,000, as rugby league remained the dominant rugby code in Marseille at the time.

===Rugby League World Cup===
Over three separate tournaments, the Vélodrome hosted games of the Rugby League World Cup.

===Rugby League Test matches===
List of rugby league test matches played at Stade Vélodrome.

==Location and accessibility==
The stadium is four kilometres from the Old Port of Marseille, in the neighbourhoods of Sainte-Marguerite and Saint-Giniez in the southern part of Marseille. It is bound to the south by the Huveaune river and to the north by the Parc Chanot and the headquarters of regional public TV station, France 3 Provence-Alpes. To its west runs the Boulevard Michelet and to the east the Marseille Palais des Sports and the Delort stadium.

The Vélodrome is serviced by the bus and metro networks of the Régie des transports de Marseille. Besides several bus services operating in the area, two stations of the Marseille Metro line 2 are close to the stadium. Supporters wishing to reach the Ganay or North stands must alight at the Sainte-Marguerite Dromel station whereas the Rond-Point du Prado station caters for the South stand and the Jean-Bouin stand. This line, which also serves the Marseille Saint-Charles train station, has additional trains on matchdays.

Marseille Provence Airport is thirty kilometres from the Vélodrome.

== Current situation ==

The Stade Vélodrome has increased its seating capacity in 2014 (in prevision of the UEFA Euro 2016 hosted by France), and continues to host games for Olympique de Marseille. Previously it held 60,031 spectators; following its renovation, it is now able to hold 67,000, including 7,000 VIP seats. The cost of the project was €267 million. The expansion and modernization of equipment was part of the French bid to organize Euro 2016. Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin&#x27;s bid also provided for the creation of a new district.

===Construction===
Marseille has increased the stadium&#x27;s capacity and installed a roof, as required by UEFA standards. The project also includes multiple reception areas and media space, better access for the disabled and better seating. The new stadium has been officially inaugurated on 16 October 2014.

===Approaches===
The esplanade Ganay has been preserved and refurbished. The RTM car park has been replaced with office towers and housing. RTM users benefit from a larger underground car park. Trees and wind turbines contribute to a new-neighbourhood HQE (high environmental quality).

===Cost===
The total project estimate is €267 million, with €150M for the stadium and the remnant for the surrounding shopping mall, hotel and housing, the private sector to cover two-thirds of the investment; the remainder will be shared by the region, the department of Bouches-du-Rhône, MPM and the city of Marseille for 20m euros. The French government contributed to upgrade the area&#x27;s infrastructure. After several studies, the mayor selected the contract of partnership arrangements included in a PPP (public-private partnership).

===Olympique de Marseille===
&quot;Olympique de Marseille will be closely associated with the project&quot;, said Jean-Claude Gaudin. The club remains a tenant of the stadium. Elected officials want ticket prices to be controlled.

===Naming rights===
The naming rights for the stadium were bought by French telecommunications multinational Orange. The 10-year-deal was announced on 3 June 2016 by the Mayor of Marseille. The deal is reported to be worth €2.7 million annually.

During the 2024 Olympics, it was called Marseille Stadium due to the ban by the International Olympic Committee on venues with corporate names.

<doc id="933863" wikidata="Q2350498" url="?curid=933863" title="Ocean Beach, San Francisco">
<text>Ocean Beach is a beach on the west coast of San Francisco, California, United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean. It is adjacent to Golden Gate Park, the Richmond District, and the Sunset District. The Great Highway runs alongside the beach, and the Cliff House and the site of the former Sutro Baths sit at the northern end. The beach is a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which is administered by the National Park Service. It is accessible via Muni Metro at the Judah and La Playa station.

During the late spring and summer, San Francisco&#x27;s characteristic foggy weather frequently envelops the beach. The average temperature for the last 5 years has been Most of the beach-friendly weather occurs in the fall (usually mid to late September) and early in the spring when fog and strong sea breezes are less prevalent. Dry winter days also tend to provide excellent weather at Ocean Beach (especially in drought years).

The water at Ocean Beach is noteworthy for its strong, dangerous currents and powerful waves, which make it popular among serious surfers. The water is cold, due in part to a process known as upwelling, in which frigid water from below the ocean surface rises to replace the surface water that moves away from the beach as a result of the Coriolis effect. The rapid rip currents, cold water, and threat of sneaker waves make the ocean dangerous for casual swimmers and even those who simply want to set foot in it, especially those without wetsuits and lifejackets, because swimmers and even waders have been swept away and drowned. The southern portion of the beach by Sloat Boulevard has some of the cleanest water in the state.

==Surfing==
The beach is one of the Bay Area&#x27;s top surfing spots and — when breaking well — can be world class, especially during large swells in the winter months. Surfers and other swimmers have died at Ocean Beach; one example occurred in May 2006, with the next-previous death taking place in January 2006. Prior to that, it had been about five years since a death at Ocean Beach. In 1998, a record seven people lost their lives there.

The Ocean Beach surfing community is served by four surf shops and several popular beach-themed cafes. Seal Rock is a prominent local feature of the area. Third Eye Blind&#x27;s &quot;Motorcycle Drive By&quot; was written about this beach.

On November 6, 2011, Ocean Beach hosted the Rip Curl Pro surfing competition, in which Kelly Slater won his 11th ASP world championship at the age of 39. This was the only one of his championships won in the continental United States.

==History==

Due in part to its sometimes inhospitable weather (high winds, cold weather and fog), the area was largely undeveloped throughout most of San Francisco&#x27;s early history, when it was known as part of the &quot;Outside Lands.&quot; Development finally came in the late 19th century: a steam railroad was in place by 1884 to bring people to the first amusement ride at the city&#x27;s oceanside, a &quot;Gravity Railroad&quot; roller coaster, and to the Ocean Beach Pavilion for concerts and dancing. By 1890, trolley lines reached Ocean Beach: the Ferries and Cliff House Railroad, Park &amp; Ocean Railroad, and Sutro Railroad that encouraged commercial amusement development as a trolley park. The Cliff House, which opened in 1863, and Sutro Baths, which opened in 1896, drew thousands of visitors.

===Railroads===
The Park and Ocean Railroad ran along Lincoln Way on the south edge of Golden Gate Park and then turned north into the western end of the Park along La Playa Street. This standard-gauge railway began service on December 1, 1883, using four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in November 1880 for the Central Pacific Railroad but lettered &quot;Market Street, Park &amp; Cliff Railroad&quot;. These four (tank locomotives) (C/N 5357, 5357, 5375 &amp; 5377) were joined by four Baldwins (C/N 7201, 7203, 7238 &amp; 7243) built in March 1884. When the line was electrified in 1900, Locomotive #1 went to the Mendocino Lumber Company, three of the s went to Canadian Collieries, and the remaining four became Southern Pacific Transportation Company numbers 20, 21, 22 and 80. Number 20 was preserved at Travel Town Museum in 1954.

The Park and Cliff House Railroad ran west along California Street and then along the coast to turn south on 48th Avenue. This narrow-gauge railway began service in 1887 with six Baldwins (C/N 8955, 8961, 8973, 8974, 9065 &amp; 9073). The company was reorganized as the Ferries and Cliff House Railroad with two more Baldwins (C/N 9756 &amp; 9763) built in 1889. These locomotives were widely distributed during the first decade of the 20th century. One went to the Diamond and Caldor Railway, one to the Oahu Railway and Land Company, one to the San Jose and Santa Clara Electric Company, one to the Glynn and Peterson Lumber Company, and two to the Red River Lumber Company in Westwood, California.

===Resort era===

Following a brief stint as a refugee camp after the 1906 earthquake, the area was touted as a resort. A small amusement park, Playland at the Beach, was built where Cabrillo and Balboa streets now end. Major development occurred in the 1920s and 1930s with construction of the Great Highway and housing in the adjacent Sunset and Richmond Districts. After the destruction of the Sutro Baths in 1966, the neighborhood lost its resort appeal; the amusement park was also torn down in 1972, to be replaced by apartment blocks and a supermarket in the 1990s.

On January 25, 1878, the &quot;King Philip,&quot; a three-masted clipper ship, drifted onto Ocean Beach and foundered. From time to time, the wreckage of the ship still emerges from the sands just offshore, most recently reappearing in November 2010.

<doc id="933866" wikidata="Q2635890" url="?curid=933866" title="Millito Navarro">
<text>Emilio Navarro (September 26, 1905 – April 30, 2011), better known as &quot;Millito Navarro&quot;, was a Puerto Rican second baseman and shortstop. Navarro was the second Puerto Rican to play baseball in the American Negro leagues, two years after Gacho Torres played for the 1926 Newark Stars. At the time of his death, at age 105, Navarro was the oldest former professional baseball player and the last surviving player from the American Negro League.

==Biography==
Navarro was born in Patillas, Puerto Rico, to Botello and Pepa Navarro, and raised in the city of Ponce. His father was a well-known shoemaker in Patillas who died when Emilio was 6 years old. His widowed mother soon moved to Ponce where she had family. From a young age, Navarro helped his family economically by selling newspapers, peanuts and ice. In Ponce he attended Castillo Public School, a public school on Calle Castillo, Ponce, and worked after school shining shoes and delivering the foods which his mother prepared to support the family. His first contact with baseball occurred when he went to watch the school team play. On one occasion he did not have enough money to pay for an entrance ticket to watch a game between the Castillo and Reina teams. He therefore jumped a fence, which happened to be in the outfield. It so happened that one of the Castillo team members became sick and when the coach saw Navarro jump the fence he asked him to play. He agreed and played baseball since.

After graduating from high school, Navarro was offered a grant to attend the University of Puerto Rico in Mayagüez, which he turned down. Instead, Navarro felt that he should help his family financially and believed that he was more than ready to play in the Major Leagues in the U.S.

==Baseball career==
In the 1920s, the United States was a racially segregated country and Navarro&#x27;s skin color presented a problem for his participation in American baseball leagues — in baseball, black players were not permitted to play in the same leagues as their white counterparts. As a consequence of this policy, a group of white and black businessmen joined forces and organized their own Negro leagues. The teams played against each other and even had their own Negro World Series. Two of those teams were the Cuban Stars, owned by Alex Pompez, and the Cuban Giants. Both of those teams consisted mainly of African-American or Afro-Latino players.

Navarro played for two years with the Cuban Stars and had a batting average of .337. The experience was bittersweet for Navarro, especially when they played in the South — he felt discriminated against due both to his skin color and his lack of English. After playing with the Negro leagues, Navarro traveled and played for teams in the Dominican Republic and in Venezuela.

By the time baseball had become integrated in the United States, Navarro had returned to Puerto Rico. The experience and knowledge he had gained contributed to his success when he became one of the founders of the Leones de Ponce baseball team in his hometown of Ponce. He played, coached, and contributed in various other ways in the team, dedicating 20 years of his life to the &quot;Leones&quot;.

==Retirement from baseball==
After Navarro retired from active baseball, he worked as administrator of the Francisco &quot;Paquito&quot; Montaner Stadium in Ponce, a position that he held for 10 years.

==Awards and accolades==
In 1938, Puerto Rican sportswriter Emilio Huike voted Navarro as the &quot;Ideal Professional Baseball Player&quot;.

Navarro became a centenarian on September 26, 2005, and the following years saw many tributes to him in both Puerto Rico and the United States. His life and experiences in baseball were part of an American documentary called &quot;Beisbol&quot;, on the contributions and influence of Hispanics in America&#x27;s national pastime. He was elected to the Puerto Rico Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. The Senate of Puerto Rico presented him with Resolution #1026 in recognition of his contributions to baseball on June 7, 2005. On December 29, 2006, Navarro was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame. Former Astros great José (Cheo) Cruz presented the plaque of induction to Navarro.

On June 6, 2008, Major League Baseball held a ceremonial Negro league draft prior to the amateur draft. Navarro was selected by the New York Yankees. He was also honored at a game during the final homestand in Yankee Stadium history on September 18, 2008. In 2010, Navarro was honored by &quot;Experience Works&quot; who recognized him as an outstanding active Senior Citizen in the United States.

==Later years and death==
On April 27, 2011, Navarro was hospitalized at Hospital San Lucas in Ponce after suffering a minor heart attack. On April 28, he was transferred to the hospital&#x27;s intensive care unit after suffering a stroke. He died two days later on April 30, 2011, after failing to overcome the effects of his stroke. He was survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.

==Legacy==
On May 1, 2011, the New York Yankees held a moment of silence to honor Navarro before the start of their game against the Toronto Blue Jays. In 2011, his home municipality of Ponce named a sports complex after him, &quot;Ciudad Deportiva Millito Navarro&quot;. He is also recognized at Ponce&#x27;s Parque de los Ponceños Ilustres in the area of sports.

<text>Macro photography (or photomacrography or macrography, and sometimes macrophotography) is extreme close-up photography, usually of very small subjects and living organisms like insects, in which the size of the subject in the photograph is greater than life-size (though &quot;macrophotography&quot; also refers to the art of making very large photographs).
By the original definition, a macro photograph is one in which the size of the subject on the negative or image sensor is life-size or greater. In some senses, however, it refers to a finished photograph of a subject that is greater than life-size.

The ratio of the subject size on the film plane (or sensor plane) to the actual subject size is known as the reproduction ratio. Likewise, a macro lens is classically a lens capable of reproduction ratios of at least 1:1, although it often refers to any lens with a large reproduction ratio, despite rarely exceeding 1:1.

Apart from technical photography and film-based processes, where the size of the image on the negative or image sensor is the subject of discussion, the finished print or on-screen image more commonly lends a photograph its macro status. For example, when producing a 6×4-inch (15×10-cm) print using 35 format (36×24 mm) film or sensor, a life-size result is possible with a lens having only a 1:4 reproduction ratio.

Reproduction ratios much greater than 10:1 are considered to be photomicrography, often achieved with digital microscope (photomicrography should not be confused with microphotography, the art of making very small photographs, such as for microforms).

Due to advances in sensor technology, today&#x27;s small-sensor digital cameras can rival the macro capabilities of a DSLR with a &quot;true&quot; macro lens, despite having a lower reproduction ratio, making macro photography more widely accessible at a lower cost. In the digital age, a photograph is more practically defined as macro when an object measuring 24 mm or less either matches the frame&#x27;s height or is larger.

== History ==
The term &quot;photo-macrograph&quot; was proposed in 1899 by W. H. Walmsley for close-up images with less than 10 diameters magnification, to distinguish from true &quot;photo-micrographs&quot;.

Development of the photo-micrograph led to the evolution of macro photography.

One of the earliest pioneers of macro photography was Percy Smith, born in 1880. He was a British nature documentary filmmaker, and was known for his close-up photographs.

== Equipment and techniques ==
&quot;Macro&quot; lenses specifically designed for close-up work, with a long barrel for close focusing and optimized for high reproduction ratios, are one of the most common tools for macro photography. (Unlike most other lens makers, Nikon designates its macro lenses as &quot;Micro&quot; because of their original use in making microform.) Most modern macro lenses can focus continuously to infinity as well and can provide excellent optical quality for normal photography. True macro lenses, such as the Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x Macro, Laowa 25mm f/2.8 2.5-5X Ultra Macro (a relatively shorter focal length) or Minolta AF 3x-1x 1.7-2.8 Macro, can achieve higher magnification than life size, enabling photography of the structure of small insect eyes, snowflakes, and other minuscule objects. Others, such as the Infinity Photo-Optical&#x27;s TS-160 can achieve magnifications from 0-18x on sensor, focusing from infinity down to 18 mm from the object.

Macro lenses of different focal lengths find different uses:

* Continuously-variable focal lengthsuitable for virtually all macro subjects
* 45–65 mmproduct photography, small objects that can be approached closely without causing undesirable influence, and scenes requiring natural background perspective
* 90–105 mminsects, flowers, and small objects from a comfortable distance
* 150–200 mminsects and other small animals where additional working distance is required

Extending the distance between the lens and the film or sensor, by inserting either extension tubes or a continuously adjustable bellows, is another equipment option for macro photography. The further the lens is from the film or sensor, the closer the focusing distance, the greater the magnification, and the darker the image given the same aperture. Tubes of various lengths can be stacked, decreasing lens-to-subject distance and increasing magnification. Bellows or tubes shorten the available maximum focus distance and make it impossible to focus to infinity.

Placing an auxiliary close-up lens (or close-up &quot;filter&quot;) in front of the camera&#x27;s lens is another option. Inexpensive screw-in or slip-on attachments provide close focusing. The possible quality is less than that of a dedicated macro lens or extension tubes, with some two-element versions being very good while many inexpensive single element lenses exhibit chromatic aberration and reduced sharpness of the resulting image. This method works with cameras that have fixed lenses, and is commonly used with bridge cameras. These lenses add diopters to the optical power of the lens, decreasing the minimum focusing distance, and allowing the camera to get closer to the subject. They are typically designated by their diopter, and can be stacked (with an additional loss of quality) to achieve the desired magnification.

Photographers may employ view camera movements and the Scheimpflug principle to place an object close to the lens in focus, while maintaining selective background focus. This technique requires the use of a view camera or perspective control lens with the ability to tilt the lens with respect to the film or sensor plane. Lenses such as the Nikon PC-E and Canon TS-E series, the Hartblei Super-Rotator, the Schneider Super Angulon, several Lensbaby models, the Zoerk Multi Focus System, and various tilt-shift adapters for medium format, allow the use of tilt in cameras with fixed lens mounts. Traditional view cameras permit such adjustment as part of their design.

Ordinary lenses can be used for macro photography by using a &quot;reversing ring&quot;. This ring attaches to the filter thread on the front of a lens and makes it possible to attach the lens in reverse. Excellent quality results up to 4x life-size magnification are possible. For cameras with all-electronic communications between the lens and the camera body specialty reversing rings are available which preserve these communications. When used with extension tubes or bellows, a highly versatile, true macro (greater than life size) system can be assembled. Since non-macro lenses are optimized for small reproduction ratios, reversing the lens allows it to be used for reciprocally high ratios.

Macro photography may also be accomplished by mounting a lens in reverse, in front of a normally mounted lens of greater focal length, using a macro coupler which screws into the front filter threads of both lenses. This method allows most cameras to maintain the full function of electronic and mechanical communication with the normally mounted lens, for features such as open-aperture metering. The magnification ratio is calculated by dividing the focal length of the normally mounted lens by the focal length of the reversed lens (e.g., when an 18 mm lens is reverse mounted on a 300 mm lens the reproduction ratio is 16:1). The use of automatic focus is not advisable if the first lens is not of the internal-focusing type, as the extra weight of the reverse-mounted lens could damage the autofocus mechanism. Working distance is significantly less than the first lens.

Increasingly, macro photography is accomplished using compact digital cameras and small-sensor bridge cameras, combined with a high powered zoom lens and (optionally) a close-up diopter lens added to the front of the camera lens. The deep depth of field of these cameras is an advantage for macro work. The high pixel density and resolving power of these cameras&#x27; sensors enable them to capture very high levels of detail at a lower reproduction ratio than is needed for film or larger DSLR sensors (often at the cost of greater image noise). Despite the fact that many of these cameras come with a &quot;macro mode&quot; which does not qualify as true macro, some photographers are using the advantages of small sensor cameras to create macro images that rival or even surpass those from DSLRs.

Macro photography can also be carried out by attaching a camera to one optical path of a binocular microscope (stereo microscope), making use of the optics of that instrument as the imaging lens for the system. Between approximately 1976 and 1993, the manufacturers Wild Heerbrugg (Switzerland) and subsequently, Leica Microsystems offered a dedicated microscopy system for macro photography, the macroscope line, with improved optical performance for photography at the expense of the stereo imaging facility of the stereo microscope; this system came with a range of dedicated stands, objective and supplementary lenses, and illumination systems. Following its discontinuation in 1993, Leica continues to offer similar products under the names Z6 APO and Z16 APO. The iPhone 13 Pro series introduced macro photography in the iPhone camera, as well as Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, which is also introduced a macro photography in the smartphone camera.

=== Macro photography techniques ===
== 35 mm equivalent magnification ==
35 mm equivalent magnification, or 35 mm equivalent reproduction ratio, is a measure that indicates the apparent magnification achieved with a small sensor format, or &quot;crop sensor&quot; digital camera compared to a 35 mm-based image enlarged to the same print size. The term is useful because many photographers are familiar with the 35 mm film format.

While a &quot;true&quot; macro lens is defined as a lens having a reproduction ratio of 1:1 on the film or sensor plane, with small sensor format digital cameras an actual reproduction ratio of 1:1 is rarely achieved or needed to take macro photographs. What macro photographers often care about more is simply knowing the size of the smallest object that can fill the frame. To put it simply, 1X magnification means: if the object is 1mm long, it would be exactly 1mm long when projected to the sensor. Let&#x27;s say you are shooting 1X magnification with a full-frame camera (36X24mm), an object with the size 18x12mm would take 1/4 area of your photo. For example, the 12 megapixel Micro Four Thirds Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1 camera with a 2× crop sensor only requires a 1:2 reproduction ratio to take a picture with the same subject size, resolution, and apparent magnification as a 12 megapixel &quot;full-frame&quot; Nikon D700 camera, when the images are viewed on screen or printed at the same size. Thus a Four Thirds system macro lens like the Laowa 50mm f/2.8 2X Ultra Macro Lens with a maximum image magnification of 2.0x is rated as having a &quot;4.0x 35 mm equivalent magnification&quot;.

To calculate 35 mm equivalent reproduction ratio, simply multiply the actual maximum magnification of the lens by the 35 mm conversion factor, or &quot;crop factor&quot; of the camera. If the actual magnification and/or crop factor are unknown (such as is the case with many compact or point-and-shoot digital cameras), simply take a photograph of a mm ruler placed vertically in the frame focused at the maximum magnification distance of the lens and measure the height of the frame. Since the object height of a 1.0x magnified 35 mm film image is 24 mm, calculate 35 mm equivalent reproduction ratio and true reproduction ratio by using the following:

:(35 mm equivalent reproduction ratio) = 24 / (measured height in mm)

:(True reproduction ratio) = (35 mm equivalent reproduction ratio) / Crop factor.

Since digital compact camera sensor sizes come in a wide diversity of sizes and camera manufacturers rarely publish the macro reproduction ratios for these cameras, a good rule of thumb is that whenever a 24 mm vertical object just fits, or is too tall to fit in the camera viewfinder, you are taking a macro photograph.

== Technical considerations ==
=== Depth of field ===
Limited depth of field is an important consideration in macro photography. Depth of field is extremely small when focusing on close objects. A small aperture (high f-number) is often required to produce acceptable sharpness across a three-dimensional subject. This requires either a slow shutter speed, brilliant lighting, or a high ISO. Auxiliary lighting (such as from a flash unit), preferably a ring flash is often used (see Lighting section).

Like conventional lenses, macro lenses need light, and ideally would provide similar # to conventional lenses to provide similar exposure times. Macro lenses also have similar focal lengths, so the entrance pupil diameter is comparable to that of conventional lenses (e.g., a 100 mm 2.8 lens has a 100 mm/2.8 = 35.7 mm entrance-pupil diameter). Because they focus at close subjects, the cone of light from a subject point to the entrance pupil is relatively obtuse (a relatively high subject numerical aperture, to use a microscopy term), making the depth of field extraordinarily small. This makes it essential to focus critically on the most important part of the subject, as elements that are even a millimetre closer or farther from the focal plane might be noticeably blurred. Due to this, the use of a microscope stage is highly recommended for precise focus with large magnification, for example when photographing skin cells. Alternatively, more shots of the same subject can be made with slightly different focusing lengths and joined afterwards with specialized focus stacking software which picks out the sharpest parts of every image, artificially increasing the perceived depth of field of the resulting image. For analog film cameras light scanning photomicrography (LSP) has been used to overcome depth of field limitations. This technique uses a thin slit of light to illuminate an object as it is moved perpendicular through the plane of light to form the image. If the slit of light is narrower than the DOF the entire object will be recorded on film in focus. 

=== Lighting ===
The problem of sufficiently and evenly lighting the subject can be difficult to overcome. Some cameras can focus on subjects so close that they touch the front of the lens. It is difficult to place a light between the camera and a subject that close, making extreme close-up photography impractical. A normal-focal-length macro lens (50 mm on a 35 mm camera) can focus so close that lighting remains difficult. To avoid this problem, many photographers use telephoto macro lenses, typically with focal lengths from about 100 to 200 mm. These are popular as they permit sufficient distance for lighting between the camera and the subject.

Ring flashes, with flash tubes arranged in a circle around the front of the lens, can be helpful in lighting at close distances. Ring lights have emerged, using white LEDs to provide a continuous light source for macro photography, however they are not as bright as a ring flash and the white balance is very cool.

Good results can also be obtained by using a flash diffuser. Homemade flash diffusers made out of white Styrofoam or plastic attached to a camera&#x27;s built-in flash can also yield surprisingly good results by diffusing and softening the light, eliminating specular reflections and providing more even lighting.

=== Chromatic aberration ===
Many macro lenses are characterised by a high amount of chromatic aberration, especially when using reversed-lens, extension tube or close-up lens. Some macro lenses, called apochromatic lenses, are designed to better control this, such as the Laowa 100mm f/2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO and the Sigma APO MACRO 150mm F2.8.

<doc id="933876" wikidata="Q1626040" url="?curid=933876" title="Homer Tunnel">
<text>The Homer Tunnel is a 1.2 km (0.75 miles) long road tunnel in the Fiordland region of the South Island of New Zealand, opened in 1953. New Zealand State Highway 94 passes through the tunnel, linking Milford Sound to Te Anau and Queenstown, by piercing the Darran Mountains at the Homer Saddle. It connects between the valley of the Hollyford River to the east and that of the Cleddau to the west.

The tunnel is straight and was originally single-lane and gravel-surfaced. The tunnel walls remain unlined granite. The east portal end is at 945 m elevation; the tunnel runs 1270 m at approximately a 1:10 gradient down to the western portal. Until it was sealed and enlarged it was the longest gravel-surfaced tunnel in the world.

==History==
William H. Homer and George Barber discovered the Homer Saddle on 27 January 1889. Homer suggested that a tunnel through the saddle would provide access to the Milford area.

Government workers began the tunnel in 1935 after lobbying by J. Cockburn of the Southland Progress League, and the completion of at least a rough road to the eastern portal site in the same year. The tunnel and the associated Milford Road were built by relief workers during the Depression, initially just starting with five men using picks and wheelbarrows. The men had to live in tents in a mountainous area where there might be no direct sunlight for half of the year. At least three were killed by avalanches over the coming decades.

Progress was slow, with difficult conditions including fractures in the rock bringing water from snow melt into the tunnel. Compressors and a powerhouse in the nearby river were eventually built to pump out 40,000 litres of water per hour. Work was also interrupted by World War II (though the actual piercing of the mountain had successfully been achieved in 1940), and an avalanche in 1945 which destroyed the eastern tunnel portal. These problems delayed the tunnel&#x27;s completion and opening until 1953.

==Safety==
In 2002 a tour bus carrying tourists from Singapore caught fire inside the tunnel, halting 150m from the eastern portal. The passengers and the bus driver had to walk through the pitch-dark and smoke-filled tunnel to safety with the help of high beams from vehicular traffic at the entrance of the eastern portal. However, two passengers got separated and made their way to the Milford end. Three people were flown to Southland Hospital and observed for about an hour after inhaling smoke from the burning bus. As a result of this incident a satellite phone and fire extinguishers were installed in the tunnel.

Two tourist buses were destroyed by fire outside the tunnel in January and March 2008, though the fires were not related to the tunnel.

Roof lighting was fitted and traffic lights reintroduced in 2004 to reduce capacity constraints and safety issues. Although the tunnel is large enough for a bus and a smaller vehicle to pass, meetings involving two coaches or campervans are problematic. This is alleviated by the fact that the traffic is very tidal, towards Milford Sound in the morning and toward Te Anau in the afternoon. The traffic lights operate only during the day during the peak summer season, since the avalanche risk makes it unsafe to stop and queue at the portals in winter and spring. With increasing traffic on the road, it is expected that the risk to vehicles waiting at the portal will also increase.

A widening of the tunnel, to allow for true two-laning, has been discussed many times. While this would make it unnecessary to force cars to wait in the avalanche areas, the high costs make this unlikely, especially for a road which (in national-level terms) carries little traffic—even if it is of very high importance for the tourism industry. Avalanche warning systems in the area are also considered to meet typical worldwide standards. In addition, Transit New Zealand () had the realignment of the Homer east portal avalanche shed as one of the &#x27;large activity priorities&#x27; on its planning list. The project would have cost around NZ$14–15 million and was unlikely to start before the end of that decade.

In 2010 it was again reported that the tunnel may be widened.

In 2020 widening was not in scope when the New Zealand Government announced $25 million in funding for tunnel safety improvements through its rejuvenation package and the works were commenced, expecting to be completed by 2023. However in 2021 it was reported that budget constraints meant that the upgrades would need to be scaled back.

Other proposals have been made to bypass the Homer tunnel entirely to reduce the journey time from Queenstown, including a Milford Dart tunnel, which was declined in 2013.

<doc id="933878" wikidata="Q5586620" url="?curid=933878" title="Gorman, California">
<text>Gorman is an unincorporated community in northwestern Los Angeles County, California, United States. It is located in Peace Valley south of the Tejon Pass, which links Southern California with the San Joaquin Valley and Northern California. Due to this location, the area has served as a historic travel stop dating back to the indigenous peoples of California. Tens of thousands of motorists travel through Gorman daily on the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5) since the highway&#x27;s completion in the mid-20th Century.

== Geography ==
Gorman is in size. It lies where three Transverse System mountain ranges meet, namely the Sierra Pelona Mountains, the Tehachapi Mountains, and the San Emigdio Mountains.
One of the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass, it is southeast of Frazier Park and south of Lebec. Interstate 5 runs through Gorman, and State Route 138 connects to the freeway a few miles south.

California poppies, lupines, and other wildflowers dramatically cover the hills in the springtime when there is sufficient rain.

Gorman is near the intersection of the two largest fault systems in California: the San Andreas Fault which slices directly through Gorman in a southeast–northwest direction, and the Garlock Fault which intersects the San Andreas about 5 km (3 miles) WNW of the town and travels approximately 250 km (160 mi) northeast along the Tehachapi Mountains to the Avawatz Mountains in the Mojave Desert.

== Population ==
The U.S. Census Bureau does not break out separate population figures for this small place, but in 2005 Gorman had only 15 homes and approximately a dozen registered voters.

== History ==
=== 18th century ===

Gorman is &quot;one of the oldest continuously used trail and roadside rest stops in California,&quot; as the Native Americans of California &quot;would have stopped there when it was the Tataviam village of Kulshra&#x27;jek&quot; explains Mountain Communities historian Bonnie Ketterl Kane.

The Spanish and Mexican colonial El Camino Viejo passed through the area en route to Old Tejon Pass. The route of the Stockton–Los Angeles Road went through Tejon Pass after 1852.

=== 19th century ===
The Gorman area was part of Rancho Los Alamos y Agua Caliente, an 1846 Mexican land grant.

The first American settler in the area was a man named Charles Johnson, after 1853. The 1853 account of Lt. Robert S. Williamson of the vicinity for the transcontinental railroad survey expedition report makes no mention of any habitations on the east side of the pass, only that a good wagon road (Stockton–Los Angeles Road) passed through it.

After Johnson&#x27;s death, his widow, Soledad Girado ran the place, which by 1855 had become known as Rancho la Viuda (Widow&#x27;s Station). Historian Frank F. Latta noted that the Johnsons&#x27; daughter, Isabel, was the only girl to study at the historic Escuela Normal of Los Angeles in the 1860s.

==== Reed&#x27;s Station ====
A man named Reed took up residence next, calling it Reed&#x27;s Ranch. In 1857 a woman was killed on his ranch when the great Fort Tejon earthquake struck the area and collapsed the roof of his adobe house.

Reed then built a substantial log house, which became Reed&#x27;s Station, on the Butterfield Overland Mail 1st Division Stations in 1858. A stop for the postal stagecoach, it was located 8 miles southeast of Fort Tejon and 14 miles west of French John&#x27;s Station.

The Butterfield Overland Mail ceased in 1861, but was replaced later by the Telegraph Stage Line, which stopped at most of the former stations, including at renamed Gorman&#x27;s, where the horses were changed. Six of them were used for the pull up Tejon Pass from Bakersfield to Gorman&#x27;s.

==== Gorman ====
It was next bought by David W. Alexander, the sheriff of Los Angeles County, who sold the place to James Gorman Sr. in 1867 or 1868. The log &quot;public house&quot;, which furnished food, lodgings, and liquor, soon became known as Gorman&#x27;s Station a.k.a. Gorman Station. James Gorman was reportedly at Fort Tejon as a civilian teamster and herder in 1854 while it was being built. On May 7, 1873, Gorman died on the ride home from Los Angeles after he fell out of his supply wagon and was run over by its own wheels.

The first post office at Gorman Station was established sometime between December 1, 1877, and March 1, 1878, with Mary E. Wilson – likely James Gorman&#x27;s sister-in-law – as postmaster. Henry Gorman, James&#x27;s son, was appointed postmaster in January 1887; Edward Gorman, another son, took over the position in September 1893. (The community today is served by a contract postal unit in the local market, but delivery is through the Lebec post office.) James Gorman&#x27;s widow, Johanna, continued to run the family farm and the roadside rest until she died in 1889.

In or around 1898, the ranch was bought by Oscar Ralphs, whose brother, George, had already begun a business in Los Angeles (in 1872) that eventually became the Ralphs supermarket chain.

=== 20th century ===

In 1901, Oscar Ralphs married Mary McKenzie, who, as Mary Ralphs, later served 57 years on the Gorman School Board (from 1908 to 1965) and was honored for her service by Vice President Hubert Humphrey at a National School Boards Association convention.

The 1960 movie &quot;Psycho&quot; also briefly featured footage filmed in the township.

;Ridge Route
The Ridge Route road through Gorman was paved in 1919. In 1923, the first gasoline station in California to be located away from a railroad track was established by Standard Oil. Gorman was a stop on the Ridge Route, and Highway 99 after 1926, where its Standard service station beckoned travelers. It was a rest stop for the Greyhound bus until 1977, and for long-distance truckers.

&quot;Being located on the busiest highway in California,&quot; wrote historian Kane, &quot;the people of Gorman knew well the need for an ambulance, as so many of the injured were brought to their homes. An ambulance service was established in 1932 with the purchase of an old Packard automobile that was converted into an emergency unit, equipped with one stretcher. The ambulance could be reached through the switchboard at the motel, and whoever was available would drive it.&quot;

Aviator Charles Lindbergh established a camp in 1930 on the northeast side of the Gorman Hills, where he tested and flew a folded-wing glider called the Albatross.

;Interstate 5
Interstate 5 replaced U.S. Route 99 through Gorman and over Tejon Pass in 1964.

;The Umbrellas
&quot;The Umbrellas,&quot; a site-specific art installation by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, surrounded Gorman and Tejon Pass in late September and early October 1991. It was created with 1,760 large yellow umbrellas, placed from the roadsides to the mountainsides. A simultaneous installation of blue umbrellas was created in Japan. Thousands of visitors flocked to Gorman from all over the world.

=== 21st century ===
In January 2006, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously rejected a bid by 32 of the area&#x27;s 75 property owners to give up Gorman so it could be annexed to Kern County. Reasons cited for the proposal included red tape and zoning regulations restricting development in Los Angeles County. However, Los Angeles County and opponents of the proposal did not want to lose sales and occupancy-tax revenue the county collected annually from Gorman businesses.

On June 15, 2024, a wildfire known as the Post Fire broke out in Gorman. It quickly burned 22 square miles of land near the Interstate 5 freeway. More than a thousand firefighters were assigned to battle the blaze, particularly near the Pyramid Lake recreation area. The fire was 100% contained on Wednesday, June 26, after burning for 11 days. The cause is under investigation.

== Government and infrastructure ==
The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) operates a resident deputy program in Gorman staffed by two deputies. Oversight of the Gorman substation is provided by the Santa Clarita Valley Station in Santa Clarita. Deputy Sheriff Arthur E. Pelino, the then resident deputy of Gorman, was shot and killed at his Gorman office with his own firearm by a suspect he was processing in 1978. The County of Los Angeles sends a bookmobile to Gorman every Tuesday.

== Education ==
=== Gorman Joint School District ===
==== Gorman Elementary School ====

Accounts differ as to the origin of Gorman Elementary School, although the pioneer Ralphs family certainly played a role in its founding. According to researcher Harrison Irving Scott, the first school in the area appears to have been the one-room Manzana School, a mile south of Gorman, where in 1925 there were only four pupils — the Ralphs brothers, Glenn, Harry, Albert and Dewey. After it was torn down, the children went to Quail Lake School in another one-room schoolhouse. Gorman Elementary School was built by the federal government&#x27;s Works Progress Administration in 1939. There is no accessible record of the first teacher, but Martha Forth was the second; she taught in 1941–1943. In 2009, Ruth Ralphs confirmed that the first teacher lived with her grandparents, Oscar and Mary Ralphs, but she couldn&#x27;t remember the teacher&#x27;s name. John &quot;Glenn&quot; Ralphs confirmed her identity as Mary &quot;May&quot; Barto Mertz. Ms. Mertz taught school in the Ralph&#x27;s family living room, and continued for a time after the school was relocated (see below). She remained a friend of the family after she left to be married, and would visit Gorman, taking her son, George Dale Beasley with her.

Esther Pereira wrote in the &quot;Mountain Enterprise&quot;, however, that the Ralphs family &quot;founded the school originally as the Quail Lake District. Classes were held in the Ralphs&#x27; family living room. The school was relocated to its present site and built on land donated by the Ralphs family, where it became known as the Gorman School District.&quot;

In 1990 Gorman had the smallest school district, and the smallest school in Los Angeles County, with just three classrooms, each with combined grades.

==== Threats to the district&#x27;s existence ====

Gorman School District is the smallest in Los Angeles County, and over the years it has faced threats to its existence. In 1971 it was saved when the state Legislature narrowly defeated a measure that would have done away with school districts with fewer than 50 pupils. Attendance in Gorman School dropped to 32 pupils, and townspeople hustled to &quot;borrow&quot; 11 children from elsewhere in order to keep up the enrollment.

&quot;Everybody in town immediately panicked,&quot; District Superintendent Lacy H. Ballagh said. &quot;We knew that if the bill passed, our children would probably be sent to the Quartz Hill School District on the outskirts of Lancaster and almost away.&quot;

In November 1978 the district was threatened when funding was curbed by the passage that year of California Proposition 13, placing a limit on the rate at which property taxes could be raised. Reduced salaries and other cost-cutting measures saved the district at that time.

By fall 2008, there was only one child from Gorman attending the elementary school; 40 came from the El Tejon Unified School District and one was from Neenach in the Westside Union School District. The Los Angeles County Office of Education had warned a year earlier that the district might be dissolved if it did not find a way to solve its problems.

But a land developer, Centennial Founders, in the meantime stepped forth with the desire to save the school district until it could build a proposed 23,000-house planned city east of Interstate 5 on Tejon Ranch property along Highway 138. It agreed to pay for a consultant to help the district find ways to stay afloat financially until the houses could be built and new schools constructed and operated there by the Gorman district.

==== Enrollment ====
In September 2008, Gorman Joint School District had just one K-8 elementary school with an enrollment of 42 pupils, only one of whom lived in Gorman. The others were transfers from neighboring El Tejon Unified School District or Neenach in the Westside Union School District.

In December 2010 Superintendent and Principal Martin Schmidt said that the district was at that point entirely a &quot;school of choice&quot; which had more than doubled its enrollment to 98 pupils and increased its Academic Performance Score from 679 to 784, with 800 being the goal for achievement. The increase in enrollment brought twice as much money from the state as before. Johannis Andrews, the principal for the 2011–2012 academic year, said in August 2011 that attendance had increased to 101 pupils, with five teachers.

In order to bring in additional average-daily-attendance funds from the state, the district before 2008 took on responsibility for the Gorman Learning Center charter school in Redlands, away (Google map). The center had about 800 home-school pupils enrolled.

==== Ruth Ralphs ====
In January 2008, Ruth Ralphs was honored for 33 years of service to the Gorman School District. Ralphs was secretary-treasurer of James L. Ralphs Inc. and vice president of Tri-Foods, which owned Carl&#x27;s Jr. in Gorman. A native of Townsville, Queensland, Australia, she died at the age of 90 on December 30, 2010.

&quot;During many of those 33 years, Ruth also managed Ralphs&#x27; family enterprises (such as gas stations, motels, a cafe, grazing rights and an antenna) while serving as postmistress of the Gorman Post Office,&quot; the local newspaper, the &quot;Mountain Enterprise,&quot; reported.

=== High schools ===
The Gorman area is a part of the Antelope Valley Union High School District, but in 1996 just four of its 24 high school children traveled the to attend Quartz Hill High School in Lancaster, the closest high school in that district. The others attended nearby Frazier Mountain High School under special permits.

=== Community colleges ===
Gorman is part of the Antelope Valley Community College District, whose Antelope Valley College campus is away via Highway 138 and West Avenue I.

== Transportation ==

Seventy-four thousand people pass through Gorman daily via the Interstate 5 freeway, but residents have a choice of local roads to avoid the freeway. Peace Valley Road parallels the freeway on the west, north of the town, for travel to Frazier Park and Lebec, and Gorman Post Road on the east, south of town, is a direct route to State Route 138.

Kern Transit provides bus service from Gorman to Lebec, Frazier Park, Lake of the Woods, Pinon Pines, and Pine Mountain Club. It offers a dial-a-ride service all year. Connections can be made in Frazier Park or Lebec to scheduled service to Grapevine, Santa Clarita, and Bakersfield and further connection there to Greyhound Lines and Amtrak.

<text>Pupillary hippus, also known as pupillary athetosis, is spasmodic, rhythmic, but regular dilating and contracting pupillary movements between the sphincter and dilator muscles. Pupillary hippus comes from the Greek &quot;&quot; meaning horse, perhaps due to the rhythm of the contractions representing a galloping horse. Notably, &quot;hippos&quot; in antiquity referred to involuntary eye movements which are nowadays called nystagmus.

It is particularly noticeable when pupil function is tested with a light, but is independent of eye movements or changes in illumination. It is usually normal, however pathological hippus can occur.

Pathologic hippus, the phenomenon of increased oscillation or their amplitude, is associated with aconite poisoning, altered mental status, trauma, cirrhosis, and renal disease; suggesting a common pathway of frontal lobe dysfunction. A retrospective study of 117 hospitalized patients with hippus noted an increased 30-day mortality when compared to controls and adjusted for other factors.

<doc id="933886" wikidata="Q373196" url="?curid=933886" title="Belmont Abbey, North Carolina">
<text>The Abbey Basilica of Mary Help of Christians, informally known as the Belmont Abbey, is a Catholic Benedictine monastery and a Minor Basilica in Belmont, North Carolina, United States of America. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The monastery is administered by the American-Cassinese Benedictine Congregation.

Pope Leo XIII officially declared the monastery an abbey on 19 December 1884. Pope Pius XII declared Mary Help of Christians its Patroness via his decree &quot;Perfugium Rebus&quot; on 5 December 1957. Pope John Paul II raised the shrine to the status of Minor basilica via the Pontifical Decree &quot;Sacras Ædes&quot; on 27 July 1998.

==History==
The Catholic priest, Father Jeremiah O&#x27;Connell O.S.B. was a Christian missionary who had built Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Columbia, South Carolina, but it had been destroyed during the American Civil War. In 1876 he bought the 500-acre former Caldwell farm and donated it to the Benedictines of Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania in hopes they would establish an educational institution in North Carolina. Under the direction of Abbot Boniface Wimmer of St. Vincent, the Benedictines set about to establish a monastery and college. The monks constructed the buildings from red clay.

Pope Leo XIII issued a decree on 19 December 1884 raising the priory monastery to an &quot;Abbey of Mary Help of Christians&quot; and Father Leo Michael Haid was elected the first abbot, a position he held until his death in 1924.

In July 1886, the first three novices professed vows and an alumnus of the college became a novice. That same year, Haid founded a seminary at Belmont. On February 4, 1888, he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of North Carolina and was consecrated bishop at the Baltimore Cathedral by Cardinal James Gibbons on July 1, 1888, becoming the first American abbot-bishop.

In May 1891 the &quot;Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes&quot; was dedicated as a pilgrimage shrine by Abbot Haid. Katharine Drexel, a benefactor of the monastery and college, visited Belmont Abbey in 1904.

===Territorial abbey===
From 1910 through 1977, Belmont Abbey was a territorial abbey, exercising some functions of a diocese. It had responsibility for parishes in the North Carolina counties of Gaston, Catawba, Cleveland, Burke, Lincoln, McDowell, Polk, and Rutherford. In 1944, its territory, except for Gaston County, was given to the Diocese of Raleigh. In July 1960, Gaston County too was placed under the Diocese of Raleigh. In 1977, its status as a territorial abbey was suppressed under the Diocese of Charlotte.
=== Abbey Basilica of Mary Help of Christians ===
Construction began on the Abbey Church of Mary Help of Christians in 1892 and was completed in 1894. The Abbey Church was dedicated April 11, 1894. The church is a large cruciform plan, Gothic Revival style brick church. It has a steep gable roof and the front facade features two towers of unequal size. On July 27, 1998, the Vatican issued a decree elevating the abbey church at Belmont to the rank of a minor basilica. The church features a baptismal font carved from a stone upon which African American slaves were once sold on the North Carolina market.

===Saint Mary&#x27;s College===

Father Herman Wolfe, O.S.B. and two students arrived in April 1876. The first students graduated in 1878. In April 1886 the state of North Carolina issued Saint Mary&#x27;s College a charter authorizing the abbey/school to grant degrees. Two-thirds of the College Building was destroyed by fire in 1900. Rebuilding began immediately. In 1913 Saint Mary&#x27;s adopted the Belmont Abbey name.

On June 20, 2011, Belmont Abbey College broke ground for a residences for female students with or expecting children—regardless of religious affiliation—that can hold 15 babies, 15 women (who can stay for up to two years), and 8 toddlers at a time, with a shared living room, dining room, and laundry room. The residence, called &quot;Room at the Inn&quot; is operated by a Charlotte, North Carolina-based maternity and aftercare center of the same name.

In May 2020, the college announced it was starting a nursing program to address the continuing healthcare needs in Gaston County.

On July 14, 1993, the central campus was entered on the National Register of Historic Places as the &quot;Belmont Abbey National Historic District.&quot;

==Present day==
The abbey is the motherhouse to Saint Leo Abbey in Tampa, Florida, as well as Mary Mother of the Church Abbey in Richmond, Virginia. The monks also are the benefactors of Belmont Abbey College, a four-year Catholic liberal arts school. As of 2020, there are about twenty monks at Belmont Abbey.

<doc id="933889" wikidata="Q859553" url="?curid=933889" title="Sundae">
<text>A sundae () is an ice cream frozen dessert of American origin that typically consists of one or more scoops of ice cream topped with a sweet sauce or syrup and other toppings such as sprinkles, whipped cream, marshmallows, peanuts, maraschino cherries, or other fruits (e.g. bananas and pineapple in a banana split).

==Etymology==
The first recorded use in the Oxford English Dictionary, from an advertisement in Ithaca, New York, April 5, 1892, spells the word &quot;Sunday&quot;: &quot;Evidence suggests that the use of Sunday to designate an ice-cream dish of this kind originates with Chester C. Platt (1869–1934), proprietor of Platt and Colt&#x27;s Pharmacy in Ithaca, New York, who is said to have served it ... after the Sunday church service on 3 April 1892. A letter from a patent attorney dated 24 March 1894 shows that Platt sought advice on trademark protection for the use of &#x27;Sunday&#x27; for ice-cream novelties a few days earlier.&quot; The respelling as &quot;sundae&quot; may be a result of that trademark protection: &quot;The motivation for the subsequent respelling of the word ... is uncertain: it may reflect an attempt by other retailers to avoid a perceived breach of trademark; it may be a reaction to the religious associations of Sunday as a day of abstinence; or it may simply have been intended to be eye-catching.&quot;

==History==

Among the many stories about the invention of the sundae, a frequent theme is that the ice cream sundae was a variation of the popular ice cream soda. According to an account published by the Evanston Public Library (Illinois), the sale of soda was prohibited on Sundays in Illinois because they were considered too &quot;frilly&quot;. Other origin stories for the sundae focus on the novelty or inventiveness of the treat or the name of the originator and make no mention of legal pressures.

The ice cream sundae soon became the weekend semi-official soda fountain confection at the beginning of the 1900s and quickly gained popularity. &quot;The Ice Cream Trade Journal&quot; for 1909 listed, along with plain, or French sundae, such unique varieties as Robin Hood sundae, Cocoa Caramel sundae, Black Hawk sundae, Angel Cake sundae, Cherry Dip sundae, Cinnamon Peak sundae, Opera sundae, Fleur D&#x27;Orange sundae, Knickerbocker sundae, Tally-Ho Sundae, Bismarck and George Washington sundaes, to name a few.

In 2019, McDonald&#x27;s Portugal promoted a sundae for Halloween with advertising that dubbed it &quot;Sundae Bloody Sundae&quot;. This generated controversy on social networks in the British-Irish territories due to the name&#x27;s connotation with the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972. Following social media outrage, McDonald&#x27;s issued an apology and withdrew promotions with the name.

==Contested origins==
Various localities have claimed to be the birthplace of the ice cream sundae, including Plainfield, Illinois; New Orleans, Louisiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and New York City. According to What&#x27;s Cooking America, the biggest rivalry (referred to as the &quot;Sundae War&quot;) to claim the invention of the ice cream sundae is between Two Rivers, Wisconsin, and Ithaca, New York.

===Two Rivers, Wisconsin, in 1881===

Two Rivers&#x27; claim is based on the story of George Hallauer asking Edward C. Berners, the owner of Berners&#x27; Soda Fountain, to drizzle chocolate syrup over ice cream in 1881. Berners eventually did and wound up selling the treat for a nickel, originally only on Sundays, but later every day. According to this story, the spelling changed when a glass salesman ordered canoe-shaped dishes. When Berners died in 1939, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; headlined his obituary &quot;Man Who Made First Ice Cream Sundae Is Dead&quot;.

Residents of Two Rivers have contested the claims of other cities to the right to claim the title &quot;birthplace of the ice cream sundae&quot;. When Ithaca, New York&#x27;s mayor Carolyn K. Peterson proclaimed a day to celebrate her city as the birthplace of the sundae, she received postcards from Two Rivers&#x27; citizens reiterating that town&#x27;s claim. Berners would have only been 16 or 17 in 1881, so it is therefore &quot;improbable&quot; that he would have owned an ice cream shop in that year. They also state that the obituary dates Berners&#x27; first sundae to 1899 rather than 1881.

===Buffalo, New York, in 1889===
Buffalo&#x27;s Stoddart Bros. Drug Store advertised serving up ice cream sodas garnished with fruit syrup and whipped cream in the pages of The Buffalo Evening News and the Buffalo Courier as early as 1889.

===Evanston, Illinois, in 1890===
Evanston was one of the first locations to pass a blue law against selling ice cream sodas in 1890. &quot;Some ingenious confectioners and drug store operators [in Evanston]... obeying the law, served ice cream with the syrup of your choice without the soda [on Sundays]. Thereby complying with the law... This sodaless soda was the Sunday soda.&quot; As sales of the dessert continued on Mondays, local Methodist leaders then objected to naming the dish after the Sabbath, so the spelling of the name was changed to sundae.

===Ithaca, New York, in 1892===

Supporting Ithaca″s claim to be &quot;the birthplace of the ice cream sundae&quot;, researchers at The History Center in Tompkins County, New York, provide an account of how the sundae came to be: On Sunday, April 3, 1892, in Ithaca, John M. Scott, a Unitarian Church minister, and Chester Platt, co-owner of Platt &amp; Colt Pharmacy, created the first historically documented sundae. Platt covered dishes of ice cream with cherry syrup and candied cherries on a whim. The men named the dish &quot;Cherry Sunday&quot; in honor of the day it was created. The oldest-known written evidence of a sundae is Platt &amp; Colt&#x27;s newspaper ad for a &quot;Cherry Sunday&quot; placed in the &quot;Ithaca Daily Journal&quot; on April 5, 1892. By May 1892, the Platt &amp; Colt soda fountain also served &quot;Strawberry Sundays&quot; and later, &quot;Chocolate Sundays&quot;.

Platt &amp; Colt&#x27;s &quot;Sundays&quot; grew so popular that by 1894, Chester Platt attempted to trademark the term ice cream &quot;Sunday&quot;.

===Plainfield, Illinois===
Plainfield, Illinois, has also claimed to be the home of the first ice cream sundae. A local belief is that a Plainfield druggist named Mr. Sonntag created the dish &quot;after the urgings of patrons to serve something different.&quot; He named it the &quot;sonntag&quot; after himself, and since &quot;Sonntag&quot; is the German word for Sunday, the name was translated to Sunday, and later was spelled sundae. Charles Sonntag established himself as a pharmacist after graduating from pharmacy school in 1890. He worked for several years under the employ of two local druggists, Dr. David W. Jump and F. R. Tobias. Sonntag established his own pharmacy (as early as 1893 and no later than 1895) in a building constructed in the months following a December 1891 fire that devastated one side of the town&#x27;s business district. His store advertised &quot;Sonntag&#x27;s Famous Soda&quot; and was, likely, the first soda fountain in the Village of Plainfield.

==Types==
===Classic ice cream sundae===
The original sundae consists of vanilla ice cream topped with a flavored sauce or syrup, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. Classic sundaes are typically named after flavored syrup employed in the recipe: cherry sundae, chocolate sundae, strawberry sundae, raspberry sundae, etc. The classic sundae is traditionally served in a tulip-shaped, footed glass vase. Due to the long association between the shape of the glass and the dessert, this style of serving dish is generally now known as a sundae glass.

===Banana split===
This dessert consists of two halves of a banana, sliced lengthwise. The classic banana split consists of strawberry ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, chocolate ice cream topped with crushed pineapple, and vanilla ice cream topped with strawberry syrup. Each scoop is individually garnished with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry.

===Parfait===
Parfait is a sundae served in a tall glass filled with layers of ice cream or yogurt, gelatine, and flavorings such as syrups, whipped cream, granola, fresh fruit, and/or liqueurs.

===Knickerbocker glory===

This ice cream sundae is served in a large tall glass, consisting of layers of ice cream, jelly, fruit, and cream, topped with syrup, nuts, whipped cream, and often a cherry; it is popular in the United Kingdom.

===Brownie sundae===
This is a rich sundae made with brownies, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, peanuts, hot fudge, and whipped cream, often topped with a maraschino cherry.

===Tin roof sundae===
The tin roof sundae (first made in the 1930s, at the Potter Sundry soda fountain in Potter, Nebraska) is served in a tall glass. At the bottom is vanilla ice cream, then chocolate sauce, chocolate ice cream, marshmallow sauce, and finally a generous sprinkling of Spanish (aka red, skin-on) peanuts. Over the years a less elaborate version with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce and Spanish peanuts, has become more common. Several ice cream manufacturers (Blue Bell, Bryers, Turkey Hill) have created tin roof sundae flavors, based on the original recipe. Senator Steve Erdman of Nebraska has advocated for the tin roof sundae to be named the state&#x27;s &quot;Official Ice Cream Sundae.&quot;

<doc id="933901" wikidata="Q1053612" url="?curid=933901" title="Non-breaking space">
<text>In word processing and digital typesetting, a non-breaking space (), also called NBSP, required space, hard space, or fixed space (in most typefaces, it is not of fixed width), is a space character that prevents an automatic line break at its position. In some formats, including HTML, it also prevents consecutive whitespace characters from collapsing into a single space. Non-breaking space characters with other widths also exist.

== Uses and variations ==
Despite having layout and uses similar to those of whitespace, it differs in contextual behavior.

===Non-breaking behavior ===
Text-processing software typically assumes that an automatic line break may be inserted anywhere a space character occurs; a non-breaking space prevents this from happening (provided the software recognizes the character). For example, if the text &quot;100 km&quot; will not quite fit at the end of a line, the software may insert a line break between &quot;100&quot; and &quot;km&quot;. An editor who finds this behavior undesirable may choose to use a non-breaking space between &quot;100&quot; and &quot;km&quot;. This guarantees that the text &quot;100 km&quot; will not be broken: if it does not fit at the end of a line, it is moved in its entirety to the next line.

===Non-collapsing behavior ===
A second common application of non-breaking spaces is in plain text file formats such as SGML, HTML, TeX and LaTeX, whose rendering engines are programmed to treat sequences of whitespace characters (space, newline, tab, form feed, etc.) as if they were a single character (but this behavior can be overridden). Such &quot;collapsing&quot; of whitespace allows the author to neatly arrange the source text using line breaks, indentation and other forms of spacing without affecting the final typeset result.

In contrast, non-breaking spaces are not merged with neighboring whitespace characters when displayed. They can, therefore, be used by an author to simply insert additional visible space in the resulting output without using spans styled with peculiar values of the CSS &quot;white-space&quot; property. Conversely, indiscriminate use (see the recommended use in style guides), in addition to a normal space, gives extraneous space in the output.

=== Width variation ===
Other non-breaking variants, defined in Unicode:
:Due to the tighter binding of value and unit as a continuous visual element NNBSP is recommended for usage in the SI-standard. It was introduced in Unicode 3.0 for Mongolian, to separate a suffix from the word stem without indicating a word boundary. It is also required for big punctuation (sometimes inaccurately referred to as &quot;double punctuation&quot;) in French where it is called (before codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5 and after codice_6, codice_7; today often (i.e. in French DTP, referred to as new-school) also before codice_8) and in German between multi-part abbreviations (e.g., &quot;&quot;z.B.&quot;, &quot;d.h.&quot;, &quot;v.l.n.r.&quot;&quot;). When used with Mongolian, its width is usually one third of the normal space; in other contexts, its width is about 70% of the normal space but may resemble that of the thin space (U+2009), at least with some fonts. Also, starting from release34 of Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR), the NNBSP is used in numbers as a group separator in French, and starting from release44, in Venetian. Spanish is prone to do the same.
:Produces a space equal to the figure (0–9) characters.
:Encoded in Unicode since version 3.2. The word joiner does not produce any space and prohibits a line break at its position.

==Example==
On browsers, resizing the window will demonstrate the effect of non-breaking spaces on the texts below.

To show the non-breaking effect of the non-breaking space, the following words have been separated with non-breaking spaces:

LoremIpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdipiscingElitSedDoEiusmodTemporIncididuntUtLaboreEtDoloreMagnaAliquaUtEnimAdMinimVeniamQuisNostrudExercitationUllamcoLaborisNisiUtAliquipExEaCommodoConsequatDuisAute
To show the non-collapsing behavior of the non-breaking space, the following words have been separated with an increasing number of non-breaking spaces:

LoremIpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdipiscingElitSedDoEiusmodTemporIncididuntUtLaboreEtDoloreMagnaAliquaUtEnimAdMinim
In contrast, the following words are separated with ordinary spaces:

Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet Consectetur Adipiscing Elit Sed Do Eiusmod Tempor Incididunt Ut Labore Et Dolore Magna Aliqua Ut Enim Ad Minim Veniam Quis Nostrud Exercitation Ullamco Laboris Nisi Ut Aliquip Ex Ea Commodo Consequat Duis Aute
Here, they are separated with narrow non-breaking spaces, to show the width of those:
LoremIpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdipiscingElitSedDoEiusmodTemporIncididuntUtLaboreEtDoloreMagnaAliquaUtEnimAdMinimVeniamQuisNostrudExercitationUllamcoLaborisNisiUtAliquipExEaCommodoConsequatDuisAute
==Encodings==
In Unicode, the byte order mark (BOM), U+FEFF, may be interpreted as a &quot;zero width no-break space&quot;, but is a deprecated alternative to word joiner (U+2060).

==Keyboard entry methods==
It is rare for national or international standards on keyboard layouts to define an input method for the non-breaking space. An exception is the Finnish multilingual keyboard, accepted as the national standard SFS 5966 in 2008. According to SFS 5966, the non-breaking space can be entered with the key combination AltGr + Space.

Typically, authors of keyboard drivers and application programs (e.g., word processors) have devised their own keyboard shortcuts for the non-breaking space. (For other entry methods, see Unicode input.)

<text>Vinicio &quot;Vinny&quot; Castilla Soria (; born July 4, 1967) is a Mexican former Major League Baseball third baseman who played his best years with the Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves. Previously, he played with the Atlanta Braves (1991–1992, 2002–2003), Colorado Rockies (1993–1999, 2004, 2006), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000–2001), Houston Astros (2001), Washington Nationals (2005), and San Diego Padres (2006). He currently serves as a special assistant to the Rockies GM Bill Schmidt.

==Baseball career (1991–2006)==

===Atlanta Braves (1991–1992)===

The Atlanta Braves purchased Castilla&#x27;s contract from the Saraperos de Saltillo out of the Mexican League in 1990. He made his MLB debut as a shortstop for the Braves on September 9, 1991. For the 1992 season he only appeared in eight games.

===Colorado Rockies (1993–1999)===
In November 1992 he was selected by the Rockies in the expansion draft. For the 1993 season he played regularly hitting nine home runs, nine triples (8th in the league) and 30 RBIs in 105 games as a shortstop. In 1994, his playing time was reduced due to the acquisition of shortstop Walt Weiss and the 1994-95 Major League Baseball strike. Castilla only saw action in 52 games, however he made the best of it, hitting .311 with 11 doubles, playing all four positions in the infield.

After the departure of starting third baseman Charlie Hayes, Castilla was the leading candidate to man third base for the 1995 season. This, along with the help of manager Don Baylor, was the turning point in Castilla&#x27;s career. By the all star break he was hitting .319 with 17 home runs and 48 runs batted, earning him a backup spot in the All Star team. He was later named the starting third baseman for the NL after Matt Williams was out with an injury. He finished the season with a .309 batting average, 32 home runs, 34 doubles and 90 RBIs, earning his first Silver Slugger Award. In the NLDS against Atlanta he hit .467 with three home runs (two against Greg Maddux and one against John Smoltz). Many considered Castilla&#x27;s numbers to be a fluke because he played his home games in the friendly confines of a thin-air Denver stadium, a stigma that would follow Vinny for most of his Colorado career. His performance earned him votes for the NL MVP award, finishing 18th on the ballot.

In 1996 he surpassed his numbers from the previous year. Playing in 160 games, he scored 97 runs, to go with 191 hits (7th in the NL) and 34 doubles. His 40th home run came in the last game of the season. He finished the year hitting .304 with 113 RBIs. At third base, he was NL leader in double plays turned (43) and assists (389).

For the 1997 season he would have exactly the same totals of home runs, RBIs and batting average (40/113/.304) than the prior year, as well as three multi-homer games. He earned his second Silver Slugger Award in three years. Defensively, for second year in a row, he led the league in both assists (323) and double plays for a third baseman (41).

Castilla&#x27;s most productive season was 1998. On opening day he hit the first ever home run at Bank One Ballpark of Arizona Diamondbacks. That year he earned his second All-Star nod and his first Home Run Derby selection, in front of his home crowd in Colorado. Playing in all 162 games, he finished the season with 46 home runs (4th in the league), 144 RBIs (3rd), 206 hits (3rd), 380 total bases (3rd), 108 runs scored and a .319 batting average (10th in the league), all career-highs and good enough numbers to finish 11th in the NL MVP ballot.

On April 4, 1999, Castilla was a part of history as the Rockies played their Opening Day contest in his native Mexico at Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey in Monterrey. The game marked the first time MLB commenced the regular season outside of the United States or Canada. The Rockies&#x27; opponent were the defending National League champion San Diego Padres. Castilla delighted the crowd with four hits including a double, as Colorado won 8–2.

During the Monterrey series in Mexico, Castilla switched briefly to number 14 on his jersey, in honor of former Rockies first baseman Andrés Galarraga (then with the Atlanta Braves), who was diagnosed with cancer and missed the entire ‘99 season.

On June 6, 1999, Castilla produced his first career three-home run game against the Milwaukee Brewers. His offensive numbers slightly declined, hitting for a .275 batting average (first time in 5 years he failed to eclipse the .300 mark) He finished the season with 33 home runs, but for the 4th year in a row he had 100+ RBIs (102). He had the 3rd highest number of errors at third base with 19.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000–2001)===
Prior to the 2000 season, Castilla was sent to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, a team that featured veteran sluggers Jose Canseco, Greg Vaughn and Fred McGriff. However, he played only in 85 games, hitting .221 with six home runs.

The following year, he played only 24 games for Tampa Bay before being traded to the Houston Astros.

===Houston Astros (2001)===
After playing only 24 games for Tampa Bay at the beginning of the 2001 season, Castilla went to play for the Houston Astros where he re-discovered his power at the plate. He played in 122 games, hitting 23 home runs (including three in one game against the Pirates on July 28) and 82 RBIs, making it to the post season with the Astros, where he hit .273 with a solo home run in the NLDS.

===Return to the Atlanta Braves (2002–2003)===

He was signed as a free agent by the Braves in 2002. Although his offensive numbers declined (.232/12/61), he established himself as a premier defender at third base, leading the league in fielding average with .982. In the postseason he hit a solid .320 with a home run and four RBIs. He played another season with the Braves in 2003, finishing the year with 22 homers and 76 runs batted in.

===Return to the Colorado Rockies (2004)===

He returned for a second stint with the Colorado Rockies for the 2004 season and had a tremendous year, hitting 43 doubles and 35 home runs, and led the league with 131 RBIs. Defensively Castilla had arguably his best season at third base, leading the league in fielding average and committing only six errors all year long. Despite his season performance, he was denied Gold Glove, Silver Slugger Award and All Star Game considerations.

===Washington Nationals (2005)===
Castilla moved on to play with the Washington Nationals in 2005, hitting 12 home runs and 66 RBIs in 142 games. He finished second among third basemen in fielding average, with .970.

===San Diego Padres (2006)===
In 2006, he played 72 games for the San Diego Padres before being released. He then signed with the Rockies for a third time to finish his career in Colorado. His last home run with the Rockies came on September 9, 2006, giving him a total of 239, good for 3rd all-time in franchise history.

===Post Playing===
Always a fan favorite in Colorado, Castilla was the last player to retire from the original 1993 Colorado roster. As of 2022, he is the all-time home run leader among Mexican-born players (320). He won three Silver Slugger Awards (&#x27;95, &#x27;97 and &#x27;98) and was selected twice to the All Star Game. He hit 30+ home runs six times (including three 40-homer seasons) and drove in 100+ runs five times. At the peak of his career (1995 to 1999) he averaged 38 home runs and 112 RBIs. In post season play he finished with a .350 average (21 hits on 60 at bats) in 17 games, with five homers and 12 RBIs. He played in 16 seasons for six different clubs, and averaged 165 hits, 28 home runs and 97 RBIs for every 162 games played.

==Post-playing career==
He decided to retire after the Caribbean Series on February 7, 2007, becoming a special assistant to Rockies GM Dan O&#x27;Dowd.

In 2007, he was named manager of the Mexico baseball team for the Pan American Games, and also served as manager in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In 2008, he was a player-manager for the Naranjeros de Hermosillo in the Mexican Pacific League.

Castilla and his wife, Samantha, have three sons, Vinicio Jr., Daulton and Cristian.

In 2020, Castilla was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame.

<doc id="933909" wikidata="Q1937375" url="?curid=933909" title="Minnesota State Highway 55">
<text>Minnesota State Highway 55 (MN 55) is a state highway that runs across the central part of state taking a diagonal route from its western most at the North Dakota state line near Tenney to its easternmost point at the intersection with U.S. Highway 61 (US 61) in Hastings. In Minneapolis and Golden Valley, portions of the route are also signed as Olson Memorial Highway.

==Route description==
MN 55 serves as a northwest–southeast route between Elbow Lake, Glenwood, Paynesville, Annandale, Buffalo, Plymouth, Minneapolis, Mendota Heights, and Hastings.

MN 55 begins at the Bois de Sioux River, at the Minnesota—North Dakota state line near Tenney. North Dakota Highway 11 (ND 11) is its counterpoint upon crossing the state line. MN 55 continues east to Tenney, Nashua, and Wendell. The route has a junction with U.S. Highway 59 (US 59) before entering the city of Elbow Lake. US 59/MN 55 runs concurrently for until reaching Barrett.

MN 55 then continues independently again to Hoffman, Kensington, Farwell, and Lowry before reaching the city of Glenwood. At Glenwood, MN 55 has an intersection with MN 29 and an interchange with MN 28.

The route continues southeast to Sedan and Brooten before reaching its junction with US 71 in Belgrade. MN 55 passes through Regal before reaching its junction with MN 4 and MN 23 at the city of Paynesville.

MN 55 continues east to Eden Valley and Watkins before reaching its junction with MN 15 at Kimball.

The route has a junction with MN 24 in Annandale. MN 55 continues to Maple Lake and then Buffalo, where it has a junction with MN 25.

MN 55 enters the Twin Cities area at Rockford and Greenfield, continuing east to Medina and Plymouth. MN 55 has a junction with Interstate 494 (I-494) in Plymouth. MN 55 continues east and has a junction with US 169 at the Plymouth–Golden Valley boundary line. MN 55 continues through Golden Valley to its junction with MN 100. The route then continues east and enters the city of Minneapolis.

The highway has been designated Olson Memorial Highway, named for Floyd B. Olson, a popular Minnesota governor of Norwegian ancestry. Olson grew up in North Minneapolis, near where the highway runs. While the entire route is designated as the Olson Memorial Highway, it is only consistently signed as such between Interstate 494 and N 7th Street in Minneapolis. The part of MN 55 southeast of downtown is known as Hiawatha Avenue. Light rail trains on the Blue Line, and Little Earth Trail and Hiawatha LRT Trail for bicyclists/pedestrians, run parallel to the highway for much of the Hiawatha Avenue stretch.

 MN 55 runs concurrently along I-94/US 52. MN 55 exits just before downtown at the westbound I-94/northbound US 52 exit, and leaves the concurrency at the exit for the Olson Highway, marked with the MN 55 shield. Eastbound, MN 55 leaves the Olson Highway at the interchange for I-94 eastbound/US 52 southbound, and leaves the freeway at the exit for Hiawatha Avenue, which is also marked with the MN 55 shield.

There has been some controversy with expansion of the highway. An area known as Camp Coldwater, considered by some as the &quot;birthplace of Minnesota&quot;, was dug up during some construction. MN 55 joins with MN 62 at this point.

Fort Snelling State Park is located near the junction of MN 55 and MN 5. The park entrance is located on MN 5 at Post Road.
MN 55 crosses the Minnesota River via the Mendota Bridge, which was the longest continuous bridge made of poured concrete when it was completed in 1926. It is in length.

The route enters Mendota Heights, diverges from MN 62, and then has a junction with MN 13.

MN 55 continues southeast through Eagan, joining briefly with MN 149. The route then has a junction with MN 3 in Inver Grove Heights. MN 55 then runs concurrently with US 52 through Inver Grove Heights and into Rosemount. At Rosemount, MN 55 leaves US 52. MN 55 continues independently again to its eastern terminus at its intersection with US 61 in the city of Hastings.

==History==

MN 55 was authorized in 1933.

The original alignment for MN 55 in Minneapolis was along old US 52 (now County State-Aid Highway 81, CSAH 81) to Rockford Road, then Rockford Road to MN 55&#x27;s present-day alignment (now CSAH 9). The present-day alignment was constructed in the early 1950s.

In July 2005, the section of MN 55 that runs through downtown Minneapolis was turned back to local maintenance. To fill the gap, MN 55 was rerouted along I-94/US 52.

<doc id="933911" wikidata="Q1069843" url="?curid=933911" title="Katō Kiyomasa">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Azuchi–Momoyama and Edo periods. His court title was Higo-no-kami. His name as a child was &quot;Yashamaru&quot;, and first name was &quot;Toranosuke&quot;. He was one of Hideyoshi&#x27;s Seven Spears of Shizugatake.

==Biography==

Kiyomasa was born in what is now Nakamura-ku, Nagoya (situated in contemporary Aichi District, Owari Province) to Katō Kiyotada. Kiyotada&#x27;s wife, Ito, was a cousin of Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s mother. Kiyotada died while his son, Kiyomasa (then known as Toranosuke), was still young. Soon after, Toranosuke entered into Hideyoshi&#x27;s service, and in 1576, at age 15, was granted a stipend of 170 &quot;koku&quot;.

In 1582, he fought in Hideyoshi&#x27;s army at the Battle of Yamazaki, and later in 1583 at the Battle of Shizugatake. Owing to his achievement in that battle, he became known as one of the Seven Spears of Shizugatake and was rewarded with 3,000 additional &quot;koku&quot;.

In 1584, Kiyomasa took part in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute against the Tokugawa clan.

When Hideyoshi became the &quot;kampaku&quot; in the summer of 1585, Kiyomasa received the court title of &quot;Kazue no Kami&quot; (主計頭, head of the accounting bureau) and junior 5th court rank, lower grade (&quot;ju go-i no ge&quot; 従五位下).

In 1587, he fought in the Kyūshū campaign against the Shimazu clan. Later, after Higo Province was confiscated from Sassa Narimasa, he was granted 250,000 &quot;koku&quot; of land in Higo (roughly half of the province), and given Kumamoto Castle as his provincial residence.

==Korean campaign==
Kiyomasa was one of the three senior commanders during the Seven-Year (Imjin) War (1592–1598) against the Korean Joseon. Together with Konishi Yukinaga, he captured Seoul, Busan and many other cities. He defeated the last of the Korean regulars at the Battle of Imjin River and pacified Hamgyong.

The Korean king Seonjo abandoned Seoul before Kiyomasa&#x27;s forces. Kiyomasa held two Korean princes who had deserted as hostages and used them to force lower-ranking Korean officials to surrender. During the war, he apparently hunted tigers for sport, using a yari (spear), and later presented the pelts to Hideyoshi. Some versions of the story say he was in fact hunting tigers to catch them alive, in order to bring their meat to Hideyoshi, as he thought it would improve his lord&#x27;s health, but later, the tigers were killed because of the lack of food for his men.

Kiyomasa was a renowned castle-builder. During the Imjin war he built several strategic Japanese-style castles in the territories he conquered. Ulsan castle was one of such fortresses and the site of Kiyomasa&#x27;s most famous battle — the Siege of Ulsan on December 22, 1597. Kiyomasa led the defense of the castle, successfully holding at bay Chinese general Yang Hao&#x27;s army, which numbered 60,000. He defended the castle until November 23, 1598. However, his bravery was not reported to Hideyoshi by his rival and superior Ishida Mitsunari. Hideyoshi recalled him to Kyōto.

As did a number of other &quot;daimyōs&quot; who participated in the invasion of Korea, he took a group of captive Korean potters back to his fief in Kyūshū.

==Sekigahara campaign==

=== Conflict with Ishida Mitsunari ===
According to popular theory In 1598 after the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the government of Japan have an accident when seven military generals consisted of Fukushima Masanori, Katō Kiyomasa, Ikeda Terumasa, Hosokawa Tadaoki, Asano Yoshinaga, Katō Yoshiaki, and Kuroda Nagamasa planned a conspiracy to kill Ishida Mitsunari. It was said that the reason of this conspiracy was dissatisfaction of those generals towards Mitsunari as he wrote bad assessments and underreported the achievements of those generals during the Imjin war against Korea &amp; Chinese empire. At first, these generals gathered at Kiyomasa&#x27;s mansion in Osaka Castle, and from there they moved into Mitsunari&#x27;s mansion. However, Mitsunari learned of this through a report from a servant of Toyotomi Hideyori named Jiemon Kuwajima, and fled to Satake Yoshinobu&#x27;s mansion together with Shima Sakon and others to hide. When the seven generals found out that Mitsunari was not in the mansion, they searched the mansions of various feudal lords in Osaka Castle, and Kato&#x27;s army also approached the Satake residence. Therefore, Mitsunari and his party escaped from the Satake residence and barricaded themselves at Fushimi Castle. The next day, the seven generals surrounded Fushimi Castle with their soldiers as they knew Mitsunari was hiding there. Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was in charge of political affairs in Fushimi Castle trying to arbitrate the situation. The seven generals requested Ieyasu to hand over Mitsunari, which refused by Ieyasu. Ieyasu then negotiated the promised to let Mitsunari retire and to review the assessment of the Battle of Ulsan Castle in Korea which became the major source of this incident, and had his second son, Yūki Hideyasu, to escort Mitsunari to Sawayama Castle.

However, historian Watanabe Daimon stated from the primary and secondary sources text about the accident this was more of legal conflict between those generals with Mitsunari, rather than conspiracy to murder him. The role of Ieyasu here was not to physically protect Mitsunari from any physical harm from them, but to mediate the complaints of those generals.

Nevertheless, historians viewed this incident not just as simply personal problems between those seven generals and Mitsunari, but rather as an extension of the political rivalries of greater scope between the Tokugawa faction and the anti-Tokugawa faction led by Mitsunari. Since this incident, those military figures who were on bad terms with Mitsunari would later support Ieyasu during the conflict of Sekigahara between the Eastern army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Western army led by Ishida Mitsunari. Muramatsu Shunkichi, writer of &quot;&quot;The Surprising Colors and Desires of the Heroes of Japanese History and violent womens&quot;”, gave his assessment that the reason of Mitsunari failure in his war against Ieyasu was due to his unpopularity among the major political figures of that time.

Later, Kiyomasa started approaching Tokugawa Ieyasu. both Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari courted his support. Ishida&#x27;s so-called Western forces might well have gotten themselves a formidable warrior were it not for two factors that decided Kiyomasa, otherwise a Toyotomi loyalist. First, the Western forces were led by Ishida Mitsunari, whom Katô loathed as a civilian interloper and had quarreled with during the Korean campaign; and second, the Western forces included Konishi Yukinaga. Although Konishi&#x27;s navy had aided Kiyomasa quite a bit at the Siege of Ulsan, the two men despised each other as much as ever.

Katô joined with Tokugawa and during the Sekigahara campaign (August–October 1600) fought Ishida&#x27;s allies on Kyushu and took a number of Konishi&#x27;s castles. He was preparing to invade the Shimazu domain when the campaign ended and Ieyasu ordered him to stand down. For his service, Katô was awarded the other half of Higo (formerly owned by Konishi, who was executed in the wake of Sekigahara), bringing his income to nearly 500,000 koku.

==Death==
In his later years, Kiyomasa tried to work as a mediator for the increasingly complicated relationship between Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyori. In 1611, en route by sea to Kumamoto after one such meeting, he fell ill, and died shortly after his arrival. He was buried at Honmyō-ji temple in Kumamoto, but also has graves in Yamagata Prefecture and Tokyo. Kiyomasa is also enshrined in many Shinto shrines in Japan, including Katō Shrine in Kumamoto.

His son, Katō Tadahiro, succeeded him as Higo no kami 肥後守 (provincial governor of Higo), but his fief (Kumamoto) was confiscated, and he was exiled (kaieki; attaindered) in 1632 by Tokugawa Iemitsu on suspicion of conspiring against him, possibly with the likes of Tokugawa Tadanaga, who was ordered to commit seppuku in 1633.

==Personality==

A devoted believer of Nichiren Buddhism, Kiyomasa encouraged the building of Nichiren temples across his domains. He came into conflict with Konishi Yukinaga, who ruled the other half of Higo province, and was a Christian, Kiyomasa being noted for brutally suppressing and persecuting Christianity. At the battle of Hondo, he ordered his men to cut open the bellies of all pregnant Christian women and cut off their infants&#x27; heads.

William Scott Wilson describes Katō Kiyomasa thus: &quot;He was a military man first and last, outlawing even the recitation of poetry, putting the martial arts above all else. His precepts show the single-mindedness and Spartan attitudes of the man, [they] demonstrate emphatically that the warrior&#x27;s first duty in the early 17th century was simply to &#x27;grasp the sword and die&#x27;.

==Family==
Kiyomasa married a daughter of Mizuno Tadashige, Shōjō-in, who was adopted by Tokugawa Ieyasu prior to their marriage. Their daughter, Yōrin-in, would go on to marry Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s 10th son, Tokugawa Yorinobu.

==Honour==
In 1910, Kiyomasa was posthumously promoted to junior 3rd court rank (&quot;jusanmi&quot; 従三位).

==In popular culture==
Katō Kiyomasa is a character in the Koei video games &quot;Kessen&quot;, &quot;Kessen III&quot;, &quot;Samurai Warriors 3&quot;, &quot;Samurai Warriors 4&quot;, &quot;Mōri Motonari: Chikai no Sanshi&quot; and &quot;Age of Empires III&quot;. He is a playable character in &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot; (&quot;Pokémon + Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot; in Japan), with his partner Pokémon being Fraxure and Haxorus.

<doc id="933916" wikidata="Q233779" url="?curid=933916" title="Wu Minxia">
<text>Wu Minxia (; born 10 November 1985) is a retired Chinese diver, specializing in the 1 metre and 3 metre springboard, and synchronized 3 metre springboard events. Entering her first major championship in 2001, Wu represented China at every Asian Games, Olympic Games and FINA World Aquatics Championships through 2016. She is an eight-time world champion, and a five-time Olympic and Asian champion, making her one of the most decorated divers in history.

==Career==
Wu began her competitive career at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, partnering with Guo Jingjing to win the 3 metre women&#x27;s synchronized springboard. She would go on to retain the title with Guo on another three occasions, missing out in 2005 when Guo partnered with Li Ting to win in Montreal. Wu also won the same event with Guo at the 2002 Asian Games.

Wu represented China at the 2004 Summer Olympics, earning a gold medal in the 3 metre women&#x27;s synchronized springboard along with Guo Jingjing before winning a silver medal in the 3 metre women&#x27;s springboard, coming in second place behind Guo. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wu earned a gold medal in the 3 metre women&#x27;s synchronized springboard along with Guo before winning a bronze medal in the 3 metre women&#x27;s springboard, coming in third place behind Guo and Russian Julia Pakhalina. After Guo&#x27;s retirement, she participated in synchronized events with He Zi.

The new partnership allowed her to retain the 3 metre synchro title at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships. It was at the same championships in her hometown where she won her only other world championship title, in the 3 metre springboard. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Wu earned a gold medal in the 3 metre women&#x27;s synchronized springboard along with He, becoming the first woman to win gold medal in a diving event in three consecutive Olympic Games. She also won a gold medal in the 3 metre springboard event. After the 3 metre springboard competition, it was revealed that her parents withheld information that her grandmother died a year before, and that her mother had cancer. Her father said he misled her to keep her focused on training. The news drew criticism in China.

By winning the 3m synchronized springboard event at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships with new partner Shi Tingmao, Wu became the first person to win seven gold medals in the event. At the 2014 Asian Games and the 2016 Summer Olympics, Wu earned a gold medal in the 3 metre women&#x27;s synchronized springboard along with Shi.

==Personal life==
On 12 May 2017, Wu accepted a marriage proposal husband Zhang Xiaocheng. The couple were married on 17 May, with the wedding ceremony being held in Fuping, Shaanxi. Their daughter was born on 19 December 2018, and son was born on 7 February 2022.

<doc id="933919" wikidata="Q954302" url="?curid=933919" title="Burns Lake">
<text>Burns Lake is a rural village in the north-western-central interior of British Columbia, Canada, incorporated in 1923. The village had a population of 1,659 as of the 2021 Census.

The village is known for its rich First Nations heritage, and for its network of mountain biking trails, which have received acclaim by becoming Canada&#x27;s first IMBA Ride Centre. In winter, cross country skiing trails and snowmobile wilderness trails are created. Burns Lake is located in the midst of a large networks of lakes called the Lakes District, with fishing and hunting year round, and water activities in the summer months.

There are two First Nations reserves that are part of the town, and another four nearby, making it one of the few communities in the province that have almost equal populations of persons of native or European descent. Local nations include Wetʼsuwetʼen First Nation, Lake Babine Nation, Cheslatta Carrier Nation, Ts&#x27;il Kaz Koh First Nation, Skin Tyee First Nation and Nee-Tahi-Buhn Band.

The town serves as a hub for the local logging, saw-milling, mining and tourist industries. It also serves as the main commercial centre for the surrounding area including François Lake, Colleymount, Grassy Plains, Rose Lake, Topley, and Granisle. There are three pubs, several cafes and restaurants a selection of stores, hotels and motels, and services including a library and a hospital. It is also the location of the head offices of the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako.

==History==
Burns Lake&#x27;s first inhabitants were the Dakelh (once known colonially as Carrier, an identification term never self-selected by any of the collection of cultures to which it was applied) and Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en First Nations communities that spanned much of the Lakes District and beyond.

Burns Lake, as pertains to the municipality of today, began as a small rest stop for travellers on their way to the Yukon Gold Rush. Many of these travellers spotted opportunity in the rich forestry, fur, and mining opportunities in Burns Lake and the surrounding area.

Burns Lake acquired its name after Michael Byrnes, who was an explorer for the Collins Overland Telegraph scheme. Byrnes passed Burns lake in about 1866 while surveying a route from Fort Fraser to Hagwilget. Recent research indicates that Byrnes was also a miner during the Cariboo Gold Rush and had staked a claim on William&#x27;s Creek earlier, in 1861. On the 1866 trail map of the area, the name &#x27;Byrnes&#x27; Lake appears; after 1876 however, the maps indicate it as Burns Lake.

Bob Gerow, one of the main founders of Burns Lake, entered into partnership with Jack Seely and Howard Laidlaw to create Burns Lake Trading Company. Together, they built a store/hotel and a sawmill on Gerow Island, which would become the hub of trade for the surrounding area. The Village was incorporated on December 6, 1923. The first Mayor was G. M Gerow.

The first newspaper in Burns Lake was called the &quot;Observer&quot;, published and edited by Sidney Godwin. In the late 1950s, another newspaper, also called the &quot;Observer&quot;, was operated by Ralph Vipond. It closed in 1961.

The town continued to grow throughout the 20th century, despite damage suffered in an earthquake in August 1963. Its current industries have become forestry and tourism, though many workers commute to jobs in the mining industry.

Burns Lake received nationwide attention on January 20, 2012, when a fatal explosion destroyed Babine Forest Products, a wood mill which was one of the town&#x27;s primary employers.

The village of Burns Lake is infamous within the trucking and commercial transportation industries for its narrow, twisting main road which made the transportation of large loads to adjacent communities difficult at times. However, the serpentine route also displays the town&#x27;s business district while many other highway communities have their downtowns bypassed.

A number of historic buildings still stand including:

===The Old Hospital===
First built in 1931 by the Women&#x27;s Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada. Once the largest and finest public buildings between Prince George and Prince Rupert, it was famous for its fine gardens. It was later occupied by a senior citizens apartment complex, then declared a heritage building in 1982 and redeveloped as an office building by its owner, the Burns Lake Native Development Corporation.

===The Bucket of Blood===

Located adjacent to the Lakes District Museum, this square-cut log building is a former fur trade post which later became a gambling den. Due to the nature of gambling, fights broke out in the building, earning its name. It now contains a display of historical artifacts from the life of Barney Mulvaney, one of the founders of Burns Lake.

==Geography==

<text>Cerro de Pasco is a city in central Peru, located at the top of the Andean Mountains. It is the capital of both the Pasco Province and the Department of Pasco, and an important mining center of silver, copper, zinc and lead. At an elevation of , it is one of the highest cities in the world, and with a population of 58,899, it is the highest or the second highest city with over 50,000 inhabitants. The elevation reaches up to in the Yanacancha area. The city has a very intense cold climate and it is connected by road and by rail (via Ferrocarril Central Andino) to the capital Lima, away. Its urban area is formed by the districts of Chaupimarca, Yanacancha and Simón Bolívar.

== Mining center ==
Originally known as Villa de Pasco, the settlement&#x27;s origins were as a mining town dating from 1578.

Cerro de Pasco became one of the world&#x27;s richest silver producing areas after silver was discovered there in 1630. It is still an active mining center.
The Spanish mined the rich Cerro de Pasco silver-bearing oxide ore deposits since colonial times. Sulfide minerals are more common in the Atacocha district however.

Francisco Uville arranged for steam engines made by Richard Trevithick of Cornwall, England, to be installed in Cerro de Pasco in 1816 to pump water from the mines and allow lower levels to be reached.
However, fighting in the Peruvian War of Independence brought production to a halt from 1820 to 1825.

Three major mines in the area include the Machcan, Atacocha, and Milpo. Silver ore occurs in hydrothermal veins or as sulfides and clay minerals replacing the Jurassic Pucara limestone. Porphyry dacite stocks are found intruded near the Atacocha and Milpo mines along the Atacocha Fault. Compania Minera Atacocha started operations at the Atacocha Mine in 1936. Ore minerals include galena and sphalerite.

The ore bodies that were deposited through the hydrothermal veins came from late-stage volcanism of a caldera system. The volcanic activity reoccurred periodically, leading to dykes, increased fracturing, and subsidence. With the subsidence came increased accommodation for sedimentation. The fractures within the rock allowed for hydrothermal activity to flow within the strata. This in turn left behind the veins of galena and sphalerite found within the Pucara limestone. Further evidence of this hydrothermal activity can be found in the massive pyrite veins within the carbonate rock. Within the faulted areas of the limestone can be found black chert. This chert, while not a primary ore body still contains some low grade Pb-Zn-Ag ore.

Contamination of the environment by lead, cadmium and other heavy metals has precipitated a public health crisis in the city, but a 2006 law proposing to evacuate all inhabitants and relocate the city has not yet culminated in concrete action.

==The United States &quot;colony&quot;==
During the twentieth century, the United States contributed to railroad construction and Andean &quot;progressive infrastructure,&quot; even as gilded U.S. companies superseded Spain as the dominant resource extractors in Cerro de Pasco. The &quot;American colony&quot; that had emerged at the apex of the Andes, &quot;the very roof of the world,&quot; garnered attention from an array of writers, including Frank G. Carpenter. His 1913 travel narrative of Cerro de Pasco, published in a number of popular periodicals the next year, brought the U.S. Andean community to life for U.S. reading publics. Almost two hundred miles from the Peruvian coastline, Carpenter had encountered an &quot;American industrial center&quot;, a &quot;foreign colony&quot; sustained by &quot;American money.&quot; Copper had captivated &quot;American capitalists&quot; and launched a Gilded Age investment frenzy in Cerro de Pasco.

In 1877, James Ben Ali Haggin, Alfred W. McCune, George Hearst, and &quot;gamonles&quot; planters organized the &quot;Cerro de Pasco Syndicate to explore the possibility of developing the deposits in the Peruvian Highlands.&quot; Fifteen years later, in 1902, James Ben Ali Haggen sponsored a dinner party in New York, which &quot;assembled several of the wealthiest American magnates of the time...&#x27;[b]efore the evening was over [Haggin] had raised $10 million capital to begin a project which would dominate the economic and social life of central Peru for the next three-quarters of a century.&#x27; Haggin alone put up $3 million that evening, retaining a 34 percent interest.&quot; By 1913, a &quot;syndicate of some of our richest men have bought the mines here,&quot; from Haggin, J. P. Morgan, and Henry Clay Frick to Phoebe Hearst and the Vanderbilt family. &quot;Today the prosperity of Cerro de Pasco, indeed this whole mining region,&quot; Carpenter proclaimed, &quot;is dependent on American capital.&quot;

Present-day accounts of the twentieth-century colony all cite a ten-volume study of Cerro de Pasco, completed in 1997. Hundreds of concise sections in this survey of Andean cultural memory, written by local author César Pérez Arauco and sponsored by the Department of Pasco, spanned almost six chronological centuries of mining, vignettes, notable events, luminous personalities, and &quot;carnavales&quot;. Publications that refer to the books frequently attempt to elaborate and expand (and revise) on six specific volumes dedicated to twentieth-century stories, as well as on Carpenter&#x27;s travel narrative. For example, &quot;stone cottages&quot; for married miners, engineers, and their families were, according to the Peruvian Mining and Engineering Institute (PMEI), townhomes with wrought-iron balconies. Small windows allowed pedestrians to view interior hallways and courtyards, while the balconies formed perimeter barriers for bedrooms. The dwellings overlooked wide boulevards and serpentine avenues such as Marques and Lima Streets, which spilled into the expansive Chaupimarca Square as well as the ancillary Las Culebras and León Squares. Dieguez Hotel and Europa Hotel on opposing sides of Lima Street substantiated Carpenter&#x27;s dichotomy between so-called &quot;bachelor&quot; hotels for male students and new employees, long linked to escort establishments (&quot;hoteles andinos de hospitalidad legal&quot;), and the more familial Europa Hotel. In Carpenter&#x27;s travel narrative, passages of which still require corroboration, the latter example was a &quot;company&quot; hotel operated by &quot;Mr. Tocci, an Italian, and the manager of the hotel at the smelter, seven miles off, is a Mormon [from Salt Lake City].&quot; Archvial documents, oral history, DNA tests, and a limited amount of records of the &quot;colony&quot;, including personal correspondence, material culture, photographs, legal documents, and diaries, have been maintained by families and have not yet become available to researchers.

Publications by the PMEI continue to emphasize the &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; contours of the U.S. colony. Carpenter likewise observed Canadians, Australians, Germans, Austrians, Irish(wo)men, Scandinavians, and expatriates from a &quot;half dozen different nations&quot; traipsing among U.S miners and indigenous Andean peoples. Carpenter seemed to especially marvel at the golf &quot;clubhouses, with libraries and reading rooms supplied with the latest magazines and papers, and also bowling alleys, billiard halls and rooms for entertainments and dances.&quot; In 1914, Nelson Rousenvell and Victor Vaughen Morris extended a Cerro de Pasco satellite location of the (gentleman&#x27;s) Club de la Unión, initially headquartered in Lima, with a &quot;gambling saloon&quot;. Rousenvell then gave the resulting edifice a Las Culebras Square street entrance across from the Gallo Brothers commissary store. The street-level doors and second-floor front balcony both bore the Pasco shield emblem, welcoming only members (and for certain events, members&#x27; wives) of the renamed El Casino y Club de la Unión. Additional examples of clubs were the &quot;Roof of the World&quot; Masonic Lodge and Club del Fénix. All three admitted only the most high-ranking Cerro de Pasco Company officials, such as the assistant superintendent and then superintendent of mines, John Tinker Glidden.

The industrial center also featured tennis courts, baseball diamonds, and Esperanza Hospital. The Spanish Beneficent Society periodically hosted bullfights in acreage usually reserved for &quot;football patches&quot;, although a handful of Cerro de Pasco Mining Company superintendents denounced this &quot;blood sport&quot;. Carpenter noted that, in addition to eight extant Peruvian newspapers, the U.S. colony generated its own print cultures, particularly with the flagship &quot;Inca Chronicle&quot;, edited by an auditor for the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company, A.E. Swanson.

Carpenter&#x27;s guide for narrating the indigenous Andean labor community, the mines, social imperialism, and American imperialism itself was &quot;J.T. Glidden&quot;, then the &quot;assistant superintendent of the Cerro de Pasco mines.&quot; Glidden secured equestrian transportation for himself and the peripatetic author. The life and career of John Tinker Glidden exemplified the multivalent consequences of what the present-day PMEI describes as &quot;relations between the [indigenous] community and the U.S. managers and employees.&quot; During Carpenter&#x27;s visit, Glidden wed, in the Church of St. Michael the Archangel overlooking Chaupimarca Square, &quot;a Peruvian lady (whose name was Angélica) and had two daughters [named after Yolanda of Vianden-Beryl and Olga of Kiev-Saint Bibiana, also spelled Saint Viviana].&quot; Glidden met his wife in 1912, when he collaborated with Ayarza &quot;gamonles&quot; in drilling a sublevel Cerro de Pasco mine, which he christened &quot;Roosevelt&quot;. Glidden, a graduate of M.I.T. (1905), had formerly served as U.S. Geological Surveyor for Oregon land fraud scandal acreage confiscated by the Roosevelt Administration and Charles Doolittle Walcott. Amidst autumn financial negotiations during the Panic of 1907, Theodore Roosevelt reclassified the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company as a subsidiary of a &quot;good trust.&quot; One week after celebrating the 1908 New Year, Glidden accepted an employment offer from the subsidiary company and relocated to the Ayarza base of operations in Cerro de Pasco.

Women such as John Tinker Glidden&#x27;s wife considered, and accepted, &quot;mestizaje&quot; as an indigenous pathway to the &quot; &#x27;gradual appropriation of modernity.&#x27; &quot; Liaisons (licit and
illicit &quot;à la façon du pays&quot;) reinforced and complicated the role of &quot;la familia&quot; and clans in the &quot;profound process&quot; of assimilation-as-Andean-indigeneity, presaging patterns of kinship embedded in Peruvian élite formulations of ethno-racial (Quechuan) &quot;indigenismo&quot;. For Glidden&#x27;s wife, cousin to his mining partner, Manuel Ayarza, Callao baptismal records (birth records missing) asserted her intersectional empowerment as an ecclesiastical &quot;&quot;hija legítima&quot;, that is, Angélica had not been born out of wedlock to Sara Ayarza and her husband, José Noriega. In 1905, Noriega&#x27;s widow (&quot;viuda&quot;) had entered &quot;blanco&quot; for her husband&#x27;s parentage (Noriega y Perla) on the posthumous death certificate (birth records not yet found), based on his own military records, testimonials, and statements. Sixteen years later, after a lengthy investigation, the Peruvian Ministry of War determined that Noriega, Angélica&#x27;s deceased father, had falsified parts of his combat record and ethno-racial &quot;blanco&quot; identification documents. Despite the results of the government inquiry, &quot;la familia&quot; Noriega still claimed the decedent, his &quot;hija legítima&quot;&quot;, and even his granddaughters, as their own.

===&quot;Enganche&quot;===
The Ayarzas, with substantial investments in the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company and superintendent John Tinker Glidden&#x27;s mines, were also proprietors of &quot;Hacienda&quot; &quot;Herrería&quot; and &quot;Hacienda&quot; &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;. The institutionalization of labor practices for the U.S. &quot;colony&quot; in Cerro de Pasco was met with ambivalence by such proprietorial &quot;gamonles&quot;. The fin-de-siècle &quot;hacienda&quot; indigenous captive labor economy from the War of the Pacific interlocked and even coalesced with the adopted U.S. debt bondage system known as &quot;enganche&quot; (&quot;hooking&quot; or, more commonly, &quot;recruiting&quot; labor). &quot;Enganche&quot; has been critically examined by present-day scholars such as Frederico Helfgott. According to their studies, labor shortages in Cerro de Pasco synergized an already-violent kinetics of natural capital, ethnonymy, race, sexuality, and (gendered) power. Helfgott, for instance, avers that &quot;&quot;enganche&quot; is generally understood as a form of labor recruitment in which agents (known as &quot;enganchadores&quot;) advanced cash loans to peasants, which they then had to repay by working in the mines, [&quot;hacienda&quot;] plantations or other sites. The system was based on people&#x27;s need for cash (which could also be encouraged by the &quot;enganchadores&quot;) and on their inability to repay in any form other than their labor.&quot;

As foreman, assistant superintendent, and then superintendent to the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company (renamed the Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation in 1915), John Tinker Glidden authored academic articles that corroborated the prevailing historiography on superintendent publications, policies, and practices. Historical anthropologists such as Frederico Helfgott critically evaluated similar writings for case studies on indigenous villages and understudied mines. Glidden, for example, published on the causes of alleged indigenous Andean ignorance to the dangers of mining---&quot;para el indígena peruano no existo el peligro; las precauciones más elementales le son descondidas&quot;---and their purported lack of hygiene. For both, Glidden blamed the &quot;refractory nature&quot; of the labor force: &quot;&quot;la causa principal y talvez única de este mal, es la naturaleza refractaria del indígena al aseo general&quot;.&quot; It was his &quot;carga&quot; to spearhead a campaign for night schools in Cerro de Pasco, &quot;&quot;el sistema educativo&quot; dedicated to U.S. parameters for cleanliness and safety. Glidden further deemed the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company&#x27;s indigenous labor camps, replete with drinking water, electric lights, and stoves, as &quot;gran progreso&quot; (great progress). But he called for health care subsidies and more U.S. nurses to combat the high infant mortality rates, as well as indigenous delivery practices, in these quarters. Despite growing indigenous demands for &quot;libertad individual&quot;, the superintendent hoped that parents would learn U.S. hygienic practices and health care by example, thereby evincing the purported &quot;humanitarias intenciones&quot; of his &quot;Compañía Americana.&quot;&quot;

During World War I, superintendent John Tinker Glidden took a leave of absence to complete the United States Railroad Administration exams. Glidden proposed, and supervised, the construction of a railroad beginning in the west-central Andes, at the Department of Ancash. This venture, in turn, facilitated Peru Bureau of Public Works approval of yet another Glidden proposal: paving, administering, and inaugurating a public cart road between Callao and Lima, further coalescing a Lima metropolitan area. His supervisorial duties for both &quot;infrastructural&quot; projects undermined his efforts to sustain a superintendence at Cerro de Pasco, although he periodically still published on the U.S. &quot;colony&quot;. Glidden subsequently became an independent contractor for superintendent roles among multiple mining companies in the Andes, from the Guggenheim family&#x27;s ASARCO, in the Alis District of the Yauyos Province, to the J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.-backed Anglo American plc in the Lucanas Province. In the early 1920s, he maintained start-up offices at the Peruvian capital&#x27;s Hipódromo de Santa Beatriz, a jockey club and equine racetrack near El Campo de Marte. Then he moved the offices to the Miraflores District, Lima---his headquarters until his death. After 1927, Glidden also established a branch office in La Paz, Bolivia, where he relocated his wife for nine years and, for three years, his youngest daughter. His cherished Andean railroad collapsed during the 1970 Ancash earthquake.

Glidden continued to assist in mining and labor &quot;recruitment&quot; at Cerro de Pasco, one stop in an international circuit that crisscrossed the Andes. &quot;The &#x27;cheap&#x27; labor,&quot; he told one journal editor in 1922, had proven &quot;inefficient and therefore not cheap. On the other hand, none but natives can stand the &#x27;pressure&#x27; of the work in the high altitudes at which the most important mines are located.&quot;

===Years of turbulence, unionization, and mining education to 1945===
After the 1920 Constitution attempted to address indigenous labor, Lima metropolitan élites began to criticize &quot;enganche&quot; and the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company itself, situating the rebirth of a nationalized economy within ethno-racial and cultural remembrances of Andean indigeneity. Their publications contributed to the 1923-24 rise of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, a militant labor party aiming to, among a multitude of goals, reform &quot;enganche&quot; and labor abuses. Both the élites and APRA claimed the mantle of &quot;indigenismo&quot;. Between 1929 and 1932, the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company laid off two-thirds of its indigenous labor force, a consequence of the worldwide Great Depression. Instead of reformation, the superintendents abruptly severed thousands of indigenous workers from the cash economy, stirring labor unrest and galvanizing the APRA.

APRA recruits in Cerro de Pasco threatened to plunge the U.S. &quot;colony&quot; into bloodshed. As religious studies scholar Annette Pelletier attested, the U.S. Immaculate Heart of Mary&#x27;s &quot;Colegio Villa María&quot; had previously become the &quot;de facto&quot; secondary educational institution for &quot;mestiza&quot; daughters of the &quot;colony&quot;---despite, or because of, curricular and pedagogical emphasis on Catholic social teaching. According to Pelletier, in 1930, when superintendent John Tinker Glidden&#x27;s youngest daughter completed her First Communion at &quot;Colegio Villa María&quot; in the Miraflores District of Lima, the principal Catholic &quot;Servant Sister&quot; instructor recorded that &quot; &#x27;the Americans in Cerro de Pasco are in great trouble, all women have had to come to Lima for safety and some of their husbands are in danger of being killed. We know this because we have some of the children in school.&#x27; &quot; The same religious sister later reported that there was &quot; &#x27;no hot water in &quot;Villa Maria&quot;; it had to be heated on a kerosene heater—same for cooking. Gas was finally connected for cooking, heating water. Cold and hot water bottles! Bundle up in shawls, sweaters in bed.&#x27; &quot; The sisters attempted to adapt to &quot;political realities&quot; by inviting leaders and recruits of military juntas, such as Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro and Óscar R. Benavides, to deliver keynote addresses at graduation ceremonies. For example, one sister recalled that, &quot; &#x27;when Sánchez Cerro came after the deposition of Leguía...Everybody of the male sex in the audience was carrying a gun.&#x27; &quot; She chose to redact her observations on the reactions of female students.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
At above sea level, Cerro de Pasco has an alpine tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;) with the average temperature of the warmest month below the threshold that would allow for tree growth, giving the countryside its barren appearance. The city is the largest in the world with this classification. 
Cerro de Pasco has humid, damp and cloudy summers with frequent rainfall and dry, sunny winters with cool to cold temperatures throughout the year. Snowfall occurs sporadically during any season, most commonly around dawn.

The average annual temperature in Cerro de Pasco is and the average annual rainfall is .

<text>In mathematics, a smooth compact manifold &quot;M&quot; is called almost flat if for any formula_1 there is a Riemannian metric formula_2 on &quot;M&quot; such that formula_3 and 
formula_4 is formula_5-flat, i.e. for the sectional curvature of formula_6 we have formula_7.

Given formula_8, there is a positive number formula_9 such that if an formula_8-dimensional manifold admits an formula_11-flat metric with diameter formula_12 then it is almost flat. On the other hand, one can fix the bound of sectional curvature and get the diameter going to zero, so the almost-flat manifold is a special case of a collapsing manifold, which is collapsing along all directions.

According to the Gromov–Ruh theorem, formula_13 is almost flat if and only if it is infranil. In particular, it is a finite factor of a nilmanifold, which is the total space of a principal torus bundle over a principal torus bundle over a torus.

<text>Luo Xuejuan (also Luo Xue Juan; ; born January 26, 1984, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang) is a female Chinese swimmer, who competed mostly in the breaststroke. She is a former world record holder in the 50-meter breastroke (short course).

==Career==
She began swimming in 1991 because her parents thought she was so thin that the exercise would make her stronger.

Luo first caught sporting world attention when she won the 100 breaststroke at China&#x27;s 2000 Olympics Trials in Jinan in a solid time of 1:08.87 and finished second in the 200 breaststroke in 2:27.29. Strangely, she was only selected to swim the 200 breaststroke, her weaker event, at the 2000 Summer Olympics a few months later. She posted a personal best of 2:25.86 in the semi-finals, only to falter in the final and finish 8th in 2:27.33.

Going into 2001, Luo progressed rapidly. At the Chinese Nationals in April, she set a national record of 1:07.85 in the 100 breaststroke and placed 2nd in the 200 breaststroke (2:26.37) which was won by Qi Hui in a world record (2:22.99). Shortly afterwards, Luo lowered by 100 breast national record to 1:07.42 at the 2001 East Asian Games in Osaka.

At the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, Luo took home 4 medals, including gold in the 50 breaststroke (30.84, Asian record, missing the WR by a mere 0.01 sec) and 100 breaststroke (1:07.18, Asian record), and bronze in the 200 breaststroke (2:25.29 pb) and 4x100 medley relay (4:02.53; breaststroke split 1:06.47 was the 2nd fastest ever, behind USA&#x27;s Megan Quann&#x27;s 1:06.29 from Sydney 2000). Luo went on to win the 100 breaststroke at the 2001 Chinese National Games at 1:06.96 (Asian record). It was during these Games that she said her very well known quote, &quot;The water in this pool is not very clean, but I am a clean swimmer myself&quot; (referring to the series of astonishingly fast times posted by some totally unknown swimmers who were highly suspected of doping at the National Games).

The year 2002 did not start out well for Luo. She failed to win any gold at the World Short Course Championships in Moscow, finishing 2nd in the 50 breaststroke (30.17) and 3rd in the 100 breaststroke (1:06.36). The Pan Pacific Championships were equally disappointing, where Luo only managed a bronze in the 100 (1:08.70) and was 4th in the 200. Ironically, her time in the 100 breaststroke semi-final (1:08.14) would have been enough to win gold in the final.

Luo eventually shined at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, winning gold in Asian records in the 100 breaststroke (1:06.84, fastest time globally in 2002) and 4x100 medley relay (4:00.21). She also placed 2nd in the 200 breaststroke behind WR holder Qi Hui (2:24.01 to 2:24.67 pb).

Before the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona, Luo set her goal at erasing Penny Heyns&#x27; 1:06.52 from the world record books. The record was indeed broken in Barcelona, not by Luo but by Australia&#x27;s 2000 Olympic silver medallist Leisel Jones in the semi-finals (1:06.37). Luo, the defending champion, immediately became the underdog as she qualified 3rd fastest (1:07.76). In the event final, as all eyes (and pressure) were on Jones, Luo took the race out really hard, splitting a mind-boggling 30.87 at the 50m mark. This strategy worked as Jones was disturbed by Luo&#x27;s horrid pace. Luo hanged on to win the race in yet another Asian record of 1:06.80, the 3rd fastest time in history. Jones only managed 3rd in 1:07.47, with the USA&#x27;s Amanda Beard 2nd in 1:07.42. Luo also defended her 50 breaststroke world title in 30.67 (30.64 in semi-finals, just 0.07 sec off the WR), and swam the fastest breaststroke relay split (1:05.79) to help China win the 4x100 medley relay in 3:59.89 (Asian record and 2nd fastest time in history; 2nd team after the USA to crack 4 mins).

===2004 Summer Olympics===
Luo&#x27;s career highlight was the 2004 Summer Olympics, where she earned a gold medal in the 100 breaststroke in a new Olympic record of 1:06.64, the 3rd fastest time in history and just off the WR by 0.27 seconds (after qualifying 7th fastest in a mediocre 1:08.57), a remarkable feat considering that she was one of the slowest qualifiers for the final and swam in the outermost lane. Jones only managed a bronze (1:07.16), after setting an Olympic record of 1:06.78 in the semi-finals. Luo pulled out of the 200 breaststroke race to concentrate on swimming the 4x100 medley relay. Unfortunately the Chinese team only managed 4th place (4:03.35). Luo swam the race with a heartache problem and had to be helped to get out of the pool by her teammates after finishing her breaststroke leg (1:08.82).

===After the Olympics===
Shortly after the Olympics, Luo competed at the 2004 World Short Course Championships, where she finished 5th in the 50 breaststroke (31.15).

Luo failed to defend her 50 &amp; 100 breaststroke titles in the XI FINA World Swimming Championships in Montreal in 2005. She was 4th in 100 breaststroke (1:07.60) and 7th in 50 breaststroke (31.50). Yet this was understandable as Luo participated in the entire championships with an injured ankle but insisted on competing. She did win the 100 breaststroke at the 2005 Chinese National Games though, posting the 3rd fastest time of the year (1:06.86). She also won silver in the 200 (2:26.50) behind Qi Hui, and posted the fastest relay split (1:05.69) in history when she swam the breaststroke leg for the Zhejiang team in the 4x100 medley relay.

Luo was surprisingly upset by young teammate Wang Qun (1:08.56 to 1:09.14) at the 2005 East Asian Games in Macau, though she captured gold in the 50 breast (31.67).

The 2006 season saw Luo skipping all major international meets, including the World Short Course Championships in Shanghai and the Pan Pacific Championships in Vancouver. Rumours started to build that Luo had quarrels with longtime coach Zhang Yadong (Zhang was appointed head coach of the Chinese national team and hence no longer has as much time and attention on coaching Luo as before). Luo was said to have been &quot;exiled&quot; back for training at her home province of Zhejiang, although the swimming authorities insisted that she was still a national team member. At the 2006 Asian Games Trials, Luo managed to win the 50 breaststroke (31.75) and place 2nd in the 100 breaststroke (1:09.14), but her name did not appear on the official list of athletes. The official explanation for not selecting the Olympic Champion is that Luo needed more time to fully rehabilitate her heart condition in preparation for the 2008 Olympic Games. The media was speculating that Luo was close to retirement.

==Retirement and afterwards==
On 24 January 2007 Luo announced in a press conference that she was retiring from competitive swimming due to a heart surgery failure. According to Luo, doctors advised that her life might be in jeopardy if she continued to train at the intensity required for Olympic-level athletes.

Following her retirement, Luo resumed her university studies.

Luo Xuejuan became, on 24 March 2008, the &quot;second&quot; torchbearer at the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the &quot;first&quot; torchbearer for China. She expressed her view on Olympic ideals as follows:&quot;As a torchbearer, I think the Olympic spirit means purity, fair play, friendship, passion, peace and harmony.&quot;

<text>A petasos () or petasus (Latin) is a broad brimmed hat of Thessalian origin worn by ancient Greeks, Thracians and Etruscans, often in combination with the chlamys cape. It was made of wool felt, leather, straw or animal skin. Women&#x27;s versions had a high crown while those for men featured a lower crown. It was worn primarily by farmers, travellers and hunters, and was considered characteristic of rural people. As a winged hat, it became the symbol of Hermes, the Greek mythological messenger god.

Along with the pileus, the petasos was the most common hat worn in Ancient Greece. Its wide brim protected the wearer from the sun and rain while a lengthy strap allowed wearers to secure it under the chin. Its popularity later extended to the Etruscans, the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Empire, in slightly modified forms.

A type of metal helmet worn by Athenian cavalry was made in the shape of a petasos. Some examples have holes around the outer edge of the brim, presumably so a fabric cover could be attached. These are known from reliefs and vase paintings, with at least one archaeological example found in an Athenian tomb.

<doc id="933975" wikidata="Q1057388" url="?curid=933975" title="Cessna Skymaster">
<text>The Cessna Skymaster is an American twin-engine civil utility aircraft built in a push-pull configuration. Its engines are mounted in the nose and rear of its pod-style fuselage. Twin booms extend aft of the wings to the vertical stabilizers, with the rear engine between them. The horizontal stabilizer is aft of the pusher propeller, mounted between and connecting the two booms. The combined tractor and pusher engines produce centerline thrust and a unique sound. The Cessna O-2 Skymaster is a military version of the Cessna Model 337 Super Skymaster.

==Development==
The first Skymaster, Model 336 Skymaster, had fixed landing gear and initially flew on February 28, 1961. It went into production in May 1963 with 195 being produced through mid-1964.

In February 1965, Cessna introduced the Model 337 Super Skymaster. The model was larger, and had more powerful engines, retractable landing gear, and a dorsal air scoop for the rear engine. (The &quot;Super&quot; prefix was subsequently dropped from the name.) In 1966, the turbocharged T337 was introduced, and in 1973, the pressurized P337G entered production.

Cessna built 2993 Skymasters of all variants, including 513 military O-2 versions. Production in America ended in 1982, but was continued by Reims in France, with the FTB337 STOL and the military FTMA &quot;Milirole&quot;.

==Design==

The Skymaster handles differently from a conventional twin-engine aircraft, primarily in that if an engine fails, the plane will not yaw toward that engine. Without the issue of differential thrust inherent to conventional (engine-on-wing) twins, engine failure on takeoff will not produce yaw from the runway heading. With no one-engine-out minimum controllable speed (Vmc), in-flight control at any flying speed with an engine inoperative is not as critical as it is with engines on the wing with the associated leverage; however, performance in speed and, particularly, rate of climb are affected. Flying a Skymaster requires a pilot to hold a multiengine rating, although many countries issue a special &quot;centerline thrust rating&quot; for the Skymaster and other similarly configured aircraft.

Ground handling requires certain attention and procedures. The rear engine tends to overheat and can quit while taxiing on very hot days. Accidents have occurred when the runway is shorter than the single-engine take-off roll and pilots, unaware of a rear engine shutdown, have attempted take-off on the nose engine alone. Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Directive 77-08-05 prohibits single-engine take-offs and requires the installation of a placard marked &quot;DO NOT INITIATE SINGLE ENGINE TAKEOFF&quot;.

The Skymaster&#x27;s unique sound is made by its rear pusher propeller slicing through turbulent air from the front propeller and over the airframe while its front tractor propeller addresses undisturbed air.

==Operational history==
From 1976 until the middle 1990s, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection used O-2 variants of the 337 Skymaster as tactical aircraft during firefighting operations. These were replaced with North American OV-10 Broncos, starting in 1993.

During the Rhodesian Bush War, the Reims-Cessna FTB 337G &#x27;Lynx&#x27; was the main light attack aircraft used by Rhodesian Security Forces during Fire Force counterinsurgency air assault missions, which began in 1974. The Lynxes were armed with twin Browning .303 machine guns mounted above the wing and 37mm SNEB rockets, locally made Mini &quot;Alpha&quot; Bombs (cluster bombs), Mini &quot;Golf&quot; Bombs ( blast and shrapnel bomb) and &quot;Frantan&quot; (a napalm variant carried in frangible drop tanks) bombs.

===Brothers to the Rescue===
From 1991 until 2001 the Cuban exile group &quot;Hermanos al Rescate&quot; (Brothers to the Rescue) used Skymasters, among other aircraft, to fly search and rescue missions over the Florida Straits looking for rafters attempting to cross the straits to defect from Cuba, and when they found them, dropped life-saving supplies to them. Rescues were coordinated with the US Coast Guard, which worked closely with the group. They chose Skymasters because their high wing offered better visibility of the waters below, they were reliable and easy to fly for long-duration missions (averaging 7 hours), and they added a margin of safety with twin-engine centerline thrust. In 1996, two of the Brothers to the Rescue Skymasters were shot down by the Cuban Air Force over international waters. Both aircraft were downed by a MiG-29, while a second jet fighter, a MiG-23, orbited nearby.

==Variants==
&quot;Cessna has historically used model years similar to U.S. auto manufacturers, with sales of new models typically starting a few months prior to the actual calendar year.&quot;
:Original variant first flown in 1961 and introduced for the 1963 and 1964 model years. The 336 had a six-seat cabin and was powered by two Continental IO-360-A engines. Production aircraft differed from the prototypes in that they had a roomier cabin and a redesigned rear engine cowling to improve engine cooling and reduce cabin noise. Gross weight was . A total of 197 built; 2 prototypes and 195 production aircraft (102 in 1963 and 93 in 1964).
:The 1965 model year brought major changes to the Skymaster, which led to a new model number, 337, being assigned. The most significant change was the addition of retractable undercarriage similar to that of the Cessna 210 Centurion, which sat four inches lower than the 336 for ease of entry/exit. Other changes included a redesigned nose cowling and new rear engine intake, greater wing angle of incidence, shortened ventral tail fins, increased elevator chord, and an increased gross weight of . The 337 was powered by two Continental IO-360-C or IO-360-D engines. 239 total built; 1 prototype and 238 production aircraft.
:1966 model year with canted engine instruments and rotary-type door latches. 284 built. 31 were later modified to MC337A standard with loudspeakers and leaflet dispensers for use by the United States Air Force as the O-2B Skymaster.
;
:1967 model year with improved brakes, 38A alternators, a redesigned cabin heating system, a split-bus electrical system, and an increased gross weight of . A version powered by turbocharged Continental TSIO-360-A engines was also offered as the T337B. 231 built, plus 479 M337B military variants as the O-2A Skymaster.
:1968 model year with a new instrument panel, improved seat belts, and an increased gross weight of ( for the T337C). 223 built.
:1969 model year with reduced elevator chord and increased elevator up travel, electroluminescent instrument panel lighting, and new cowl flap controls. Also offered as the turbocharged T337D. 215 built.
:1970 model year with conical cambered wingtips, a new fuel quantity system, and an increased gross weight of ( for the T337E). 123 built, plus 24 in France by Reims Aviation for the European market as the F337E.
:One aircraft converted from the 20th production F337E.
:Introduced for the 1971 model year with an increased gross weight of (same as the T337F) a refined instrument panel, a padded glareshield, a front engine access panel, and other minor changes. The 1972 model year introduced nose-mounted landing/taxi lights and minor interior changes. The turbocharged T337F was only offered for the 1971 model year. 147 total built; 83 (1971) and 64 (1972). Reims also built a total of 31 as the F337F; 21 (1971) and 10 (1972).
:Introduced for the 1973 model year with a recontoured nose cap, flush wingtip lights, low-drag front exhaust stack and wing strut fairings, a flush-mounted pitot port on the left wing strut, a split airstair door replacing the cabin and baggage doors, aileron gap seals, and a hydraulic powerpack replacing the engine-driven pump. Power was provided by two Continental IO-360-G engines. The 1974 model year introduced recessed parking brake control, a hydraulic gear accumulator, and improved subpanel rocker switches. 1975 introduced an optional auxiliary fuel system and the Skymaster II with a preferred options package. 1976 introduced a &quot;Camber-Lift&quot; wing, a redesigned instrument panel, and a reworked fuel system with tail boom fuel sump tanks removed. 1977 introduced a new front propeller airfoil and an auxiliary master power switch. A turbocharged version of the unpressurized 337G was not offered. 354 total built; 88 (1973), 56 (1974), 65 (1975), 77 (1976), and 68 (1977). Reims also built a total of 29 as the F337G; 8 (1973), 8 (1974), 5 (1975), 3 (1976), and 5 (1977).
;
:Also known as the T337G, introduced for the 1973 model year as a turbocharged, pressurized version of the 337G. The P337G was powered by two TSIO-360-C engines. Like the 337G, the Skymaster II option was also available for the P337G. 292 total built; 1 (1971 prototype), 148 (1973), 45 (1974), 31 (1975), 32 (1976), and 35 (1977). Reims also built a total of 22 as the FT337GP; 8 (1973), 5 (1974), 2 (1975), 2 (1976), and 5 (1977).
:Military variant of the F337G with Sierra Industries Robertson STOL modifications and underwing hardpoints. Known as the Lynx in Rhodesian Air Force service. 61 built.
:Introduced for the 1978 model year with redesigned control wheels and minor interior refinements. The turbocharged version was also offered after a six year absence as the T337H, which was powered by two Continental TSIO-360-H engines. The T337H-SP was introduced for the 1980 model year and was powered by TSIO-360-JB engines. The 1980 model year replaced the engines of the 337H and T337H with the TSIO-360-GB and TSIO-360-HB, respectively. 140 total built; 58 (1978), 47 (1979 337H/T337H), 1 (1979 T337H-SP prototype), 24 (1980 337H/T337H), and 10 (1980 T337H-SP). Reims also built 2 aircraft in 1978 as the F337H.
:Introduced for the 1978 model year as a turbocharged, pressurized version of the 337H powered by two TSIO-360-C engines, which were replaced by the TSIO-360-C for the 1980 model year. 64 total built; 26 (1978), 24 (1979), and 15 (1980). Reims also built 1 aircraft in 1978 as the FT337HP.
:Based on the M337B but with two Allison 250-B15 turboprop engines, a longer span wing, and improved high lift devices. Designated O-2T, only a single prototype was built.
:Also known as the O-2TT, a proposed variant of the O-2T with a tandem two-seat cockpit for the pilot and observer. Only a mockup was built.
:Reduced-scale four-seat version of the 337 first proposed in 1965 as the Model 377 with cantilever wings replacing the 336/337 strut-braced configuration. The 377 was later redesignated as the Model 327 in 1967 and was first flown in December of that year. One prototype was built before the project was canceled in 1968 due to lack of commercial interest in the design. The prototype was delivered to NASA to serve as a full-scale model for wind tunnel testing. It was used in a joint Langley Research Center and Cessna project on noise reduction and the use of ducted versus free propellers.

<text>The tricorne or tricorn is a style of hat in a triangular shape, which became popular in Europe during the 18th century, falling out of style by the early 1800s. The word &quot;tricorne&quot; was not widely used until the mid-19th century. During the 18th century, hats of this general style were referred to as &quot;cocked hats&quot;. 

At the peak of its popularity, the tricorne varied greatly in style and size, and was worn not only by the aristocracy, but also as common civilian dress, and as part of military and naval uniforms. Typically made from animal fiber, the more expensive being of beaver-hair felt and the less expensive of wool felt, the hat&#x27;s most distinguishing characteristic was that three sides of the brim were turned up (cocked) and either pinned, laced, or buttoned in place to form a triangle around the crown. The style served two purposes: first, it allowed stylish gentlemen to show off the most current fashions of their wigs, and thus their social status; and secondly, the cocked hat, with its folded brim, was much smaller than other hats, and therefore could be more easily tucked under an arm when going inside a building, where social etiquette dictates that a gentleman should remove his hat. Tricornes with laced sides could have the laces loosened and the sides dropped down to provide better protection from the weather, sun, and rain.

Tricornes had a rather broad brim, pinned up on either side of the head and at the back, producing a triangular shape. The hat was typically worn with one point facing forward, though it was not at all unusual for soldiers, who would often rest a rifle or musket on their right shoulder, to wear the tricorne pointed to the left to allow better clearance. The crown is low, unlike the steeple hats worn by the Puritans or the top hat of the 19th century.

Tricornes ranged from the very simple and cheap to the extravagant, occasionally incorporating gold or silver lace trimming and feathers. In addition, military and naval versions usually bore a cockade or other national emblem at the front. This style of hat remains in use in a number of countries to the present day as an item of ceremonial dress.

==History==
The tricorne appeared as a result of the evolution of the broad-brim round hat used by Spanish soldiers in Flanders during the 17th century. By pledging (binding) the brims, a triangular shape was obtained. This shape was favored by Spanish soldiers, as when standing at arms their muskets could be held at their shoulders right or left without hitting the hat brim. War broke out between France and Spain in 1667 over the Spanish Netherlands, and during the subsequent struggle its use spread to the French armies. The style was brought back to France, where its usage spread to the French population and the royal court of King Louis XIV, who made it fashionable throughout Europe, both as a civilian and military wear. By the end of the 17th century, the tricorne was popular in both civilian fashion and in military uniforms. They remained one of the predominant European styles of hat throughout the 18th century. In the United States, only the first five presidents, from George Washington to James Monroe, wore this style of hat according to the fashion of the 18th century. James Monroe earned the nickname &quot;The Last Cocked Hat&quot; because of this.

The tricorne quickly declined in use at the end of the 18th century. It evolved into the bicorne, which was widely used by military officers in Europe from the 1790s until World War I, not completely fading out of style until World War II. For enlisted soldiers, the tricorne was replaced by the shako at the turn of the 19th century, which had become the new dominant style of military headgear from 1800 on. Also at the turn of the 19th century, as the fashionable hat for civilian men, the tricorne was overtaken by the top hat. In 1917, the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service introduced a smaller, modernised version of the tricorne for female officers.
==Modern usage and legacy==
Tricornes survive today as part of the traditional dress of the Chelsea Pensioners (UK) and the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps of the United States Army, and the distinctive hat of the Spanish Guardia Civil, called a &quot;tricornio&quot; in Spanish, originates from the tricorne. In the UK, a black feathered tricorne hat is part of the ceremonial dress of most Lord Mayors; at the annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show in November, the newly elected Lord Mayor of the City of London can usually be seen enthusiastically waving his tricorne at the crowds. In the British Parliament until recently, both the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons used to carry plain black tricornes as part of their formal dress each day when on duty; only on rare occasions was it worn (on top of the full bottomed wig): by the Lord Chancellor when acting as a Lord Commissioner of the Sovereign, and by the Speaker when rebuking a Member at the Bar of the House. During the Introduction Ceremony, new members of the House of Lords were required to doff (remove and replace) a tricorne hat three times before the Lord Chancellor; however, hats were removed from the ritual in 1998.

In the United States, the tricorne is associated with the American Revolution and American Patriots of that era, especially Minutemen (militia members of the American Colonies). Participants in re-enactment events often don tricornes, and they also can be seen in sports culture as worn by fans of teams with Revolutionary names, such as the New England Patriots (an American football team), the New England Revolution (a Major League Soccer team), the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the George Washington University. The Tea Party movement also uses the tricorne as an icon to associate itself with the American Revolution.

In Spain, the traditional headdress of the Guardia Civil, the oldest law enforcement agency covering the whole country, is the &quot;tricornio&quot; hat, originally a tricorne. Its use now is reserved for parades or ceremonies. The Royal Corps of Halberdiers within the Spanish Royal Guard wear blue and white with a silver ribbon tricorne as part of their formal dress.

In France, synagogue officiants (usually not rabbis) wear the tricorne on formal occasions. In the French Navy and Air Force, tricornes are still worn by women as a piece of uniform.

The tricorne is a key feature in the Portuguese University of Minho&#x27;s academic dress. Its origins are as far as 18th century, as being the academic dress of Colégio de Estudos Superiores de S. Paulo, as depicted by tile panels in the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace of Braga (now Rectorate of the University of Minho). Designated by &quot;Tricórnio&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;tricorne&quot;), this academic dress was redesigned and officially set in 1989.

In Canada, the tricorne is part of the ceremonial wear of the Speakers, both in the federal Parliament and in some provincial legislatures. It is also part of the ceremonial dress for justices of the Supreme Court of Canada.

In 1981, the milliner John Boyd made a famous pink tricorne hat for Diana, Princess of Wales. This style became known as the &quot;Lady Di&quot; design and was copied worldwide.
