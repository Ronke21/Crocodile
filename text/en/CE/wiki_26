<text>Pramoedya Ananta Toer (EYD: Pramudya Ananta Tur; 6 February 1925 – 30 April 2006), also nicknamed Pram, was an Indonesian novelist and writer. His works span the colonial period under Dutch rule, Indonesia&#x27;s struggle for independence, its occupation by Japan during World War II, as well as the post-colonial authoritarian regimes of Sukarno and Suharto, and are infused with personal and national history.

Pramoedya&#x27;s writings sometimes fell out of favour with the colonial and later the authoritarian native governments in power. He faced censorship in Indonesia during the pre-&quot;Reformasi&quot; era even though he was well-known outside Indonesia. Dutch authorities imprisoned him from 1947 to 1949 during the War of Independence. During the transition to the Suharto regime, he was caught up in the shifting tides of political change and power struggles. Suharto had him imprisoned from 1969 to 1979 on the Maluku island of Buru and branded him a Communist. He was seen as a holdover from the previous regime, despite having struggled with it. It was on the Island of Buru that he composed his most famous work, the Buru Quartet. Not permitted access to writing materials, he recited the story orally to other prisoners before it was written down and smuggled out.

Pramoedya opposed some policies of founding President Sukarno as well as the New Order regime of Suharto, Sukarno&#x27;s successor. Political criticisms were often subtle in his writing, although he was outspoken against colonialism, racism, and corruption of the Indonesian new government. During the many years in which he suffered imprisonment and house arrest (in Jakarta after his imprisonment in Buru), he became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for advocates of human rights and freedom of expression.

==Early years==
Pramoedya was born on 6 February 1925, in the town of Blora in the heartland of Java, then a part of the Dutch East Indies. He was the firstborn son in his family; his father was a teacher, who was also active in Boedi Oetomo (the first recognized indigenous national organization in Indonesia) and his mother was a rice trader. His maternal grandfather had taken the pilgrimage to Mecca. As it is written in his semi-autobiographical collection of short stories &quot;Cerita Dari Blora&quot;, his name was originally Pramoedya Ananta Mastoer. However, he felt that the family name Mastoer (his father&#x27;s name) seemed too aristocratic. The Javanese prefix &quot;Mas&quot; refers to a man of a higher rank in a noble family. Consequently, he omitted &quot;Mas&quot; and kept Toer as his family name. He went on to the Radio Vocational School in Surabaya but had barely graduated from the school when Japan invaded Surabaya (1942).

During World War II, Pramoedya (like many Indonesian Nationalists, Sukarno and Suharto among them) at first supported the occupying forces of Imperial Japan. He believed the Japanese to be the lesser of two evils, compared to the Dutch. He worked as a typist for a Japanese newspaper in Jakarta. As the war went on, however, Indonesians were dismayed by the austerity of wartime rationing and by increasingly harsh measures taken by the Japanese military. The Nationalist forces loyal to Sukarno switched their support to the incoming Allies against Japan; all indications are that Pramoedya did as well.

On 17 August 1945, after the news of the Allied victory over Japan reached Indonesia, Sukarno proclaimed Indonesian independence. This touched off the Indonesian National Revolution against the forces of the British and Dutch. In this war, Pramoedya joined a paramilitary group in Karawang, Kranji (West Java), and eventually was stationed in Jakarta. During this time he wrote short stories and books, as well as propaganda for the Nationalist cause. He was eventually imprisoned by the Dutch in Jakarta in 1947 and remained there until 1949, the year the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence. While imprisoned in Bukit Duri from 1947 to 1949 for his role in the Indonesian Revolution, he wrote his first major novels &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Guerilla Family&quot; with financial support from the Opbouw-Pembangoenan Foundation, which also published the books.

==Post-Independence prominence==
In the first years after the struggle for independence, Pramoedya wrote several works of fiction dealing with the problems of the newly founded nation, as well as semi-autobiographical works based on his wartime memoirs. He was soon able to live in the Netherlands as part of a cultural exchange program. In the years that followed, he took an interest in several other cultural exchanges, including trips to the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, as well as translations of Russian writers Maxim Gorky and Leo Tolstoy.

In Indonesia, Pramoedya built up a reputation as a literary and social critic, joining the left-wing writers&#x27; group Lekra and writing in various newspapers and literary journals. His writing style became more politically charged, as evidenced in his story &quot;Korupsi&quot; (&quot;Corruption&quot;), a critical fiction of a civil servant who falls into the trap of corruption. This created friction between him and the government of Sukarno.

From the late 1950s, Pramoedya began teaching literary history at the left-wing &quot;Universitas Res Publica&quot;. As he prepared the material, he began to realise that the study of the Indonesian language and literature had been distorted by the Dutch colonial authorities. He sought out materials that had been ignored by colonial educational institutions, and which had continued to be ignored after independence.

Having spent time in China, he became greatly sympathetic to the Indonesian Chinese over the persecution they faced in post-colonial Indonesia. Most notably, he published a series of letters addressed to an imaginary Chinese correspondent discussing the history of the Indonesian Chinese, called &quot;Hoakiau di Indonesia&quot; (History of the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia). He criticised the government for being too centred on Java and insensitive to the needs and desires of the other regions and peoples of Indonesia. As a result, he was arrested by the Indonesian military and jailed at Cipinang prison for nine months.

==Imprisonment under Suharto==
In an October 1965 coup, the army took power after alleging that the assassination of several senior generals was masterminded by the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). The transition to Suharto&#x27;s New Order followed, and Pramoedya&#x27;s position as the head of the People&#x27;s Cultural Organisation, a literary group with connections to the PKI, caused him to be considered a communist and an enemy of the &quot;New Order&quot; regime. During the violent anti-Communist purge, he was arrested, beaten, and imprisoned by Suharto&#x27;s government and named a &quot;tapol&quot; (&quot;political prisoner&quot;). His books were banned from circulation, and he was imprisoned without trial, first in Nusa Kambangan off the southern coast of Java, and then in the penal colony of Buru in the eastern islands of the Indonesian archipelago.

He was banned from writing during his imprisonment on the island of Buru but still managed to compose - orally - his best-known series of work to date, the Buru Quartet, a series of four historical fiction novels chronicling the development of Indonesian nationalism and based in part on his own experiences growing up. The English titles of the books in the tetralogy are &quot;This Earth of Mankind&quot;, &quot;Child of All Nations&quot;, &quot;Footsteps&quot;, and &quot;House of Glass&quot;. The main character of the series, Minke, a Javanese minor royal, was based in part on an Indonesian journalist active in the nationalist movement, Tirto Adhi Soerjo.

The quartet includes strong female characters of Indonesian and Chinese ethnicity and addresses the discrimination and indignities of living under colonial rule and the struggle for personal and national political independence. Like much of Pramoedya&#x27;s work, it tells personal stories and focuses on individuals caught up in the tide of a nation&#x27;s history.

Pramoedya had researched for the books before his imprisonment in the Buru prison camp. When he was arrested, his library was burned, and much of his collection and early writings were lost. In Buru, he was not permitted even to have a pencil. Doubting that he would ever be able to write the novels down himself, he narrated them to his fellow prisoners. With the support of other prisoners who took on extra labour to reduce his workload, Pramoedya was eventually able to write the novels down, and the published works derived their name &quot;Buru Quartet&quot; after the prison. They have been collected and published in English (translated by Max Lane) and Indonesian, as well as many other languages. Though the work is considered a classic by many outside of Indonesia, the publication was banned in Indonesia, causing one of the most famous of Indonesia&#x27;s literary works to be mostly unavailable to the country&#x27;s people whose history it addressed. Copies were scanned by Indonesians abroad and distributed via the Internet to people inside the country.

Pramoedya&#x27;s works on colonial Indonesia recognised the importance of Islam as a vehicle for widespread opposition to the Dutch, but his works are not overtly religious. He rejected those who used religion to deny critical thinking, and on occasion wrote with considerable negativity to the religiously pious.

==Release and subsequent works==
Pramoedya was released from imprisonment in 1979 but remained under house arrest in Jakarta until 1992. During this time he released &quot;The Girl From the Coast&quot;, another semi-fictional novel based on his grandmother&#x27;s own experience (volumes 2 and 3 of this work were destroyed along with his library in 1965). He also wrote &quot;Nyanyi Sunyi Seorang Bisu&quot; (1995); &quot;A Mute&#x27;s Soliloquy&quot;, an autobiography based on the letters that he wrote for his daughter from imprisonment in Buru but were not allowed to be sent, and &quot;Arus Balik&quot; (1995).

He wrote many columns and short articles criticising the Indonesian government. He wrote the book &quot;Perawan Remaja dalam Cengkeraman Militer&quot; (&quot;Young Virgins in the Military&#x27;s Grip&quot;), a documentary showcasing the plight of Javanese women who were forced to become comfort women during the Japanese occupation and were subsequently subject to oppression by their Indonesian society. The women were brought to Buru where they were sexually abused by the Japanese and ended up staying there instead of returning to Java. Pramoedya&#x27;s fellow political prisoners were able to meet some of these women (generally only once) and relate this information to Pramoedya, who wrote it down in narrative form in the 1970s, providing the basis for the book published in 2001.

Pramoedya was hospitalised on 27 April 2006, for complications brought on by diabetes and heart disease. He was also a heavy smoker of Kretek (clove) cigarettes and had endured years of abuse while in detention. After his release, his health deteriorated and on April 30 he died in his daughter&#x27;s home. Pramoedya earned several accolades and was frequently discussed as Indonesia&#x27;s and Southeast Asia&#x27;s best candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature.

Pramoedya&#x27;s writings on Indonesia address the international and regional currents caused by political events in history and how these events flowed through his homeland and buffeted its people. Pramoedya also shares a personal history of hardship and detention for his efforts of self-expression and the political aspects of his writings and struggles against the censorship of his work by the leaders of his people.

== Personal life ==

Pramoedya married Arvah Iljas in 1950. However, the couple divorced in 1954. He remarried to Maemunah Thamrin in 1955. She died a couple of months before Pramoedya&#x27;s death in 2006.

Rdb was a component of the &quot;VAX Information Architecture&quot;, and was designed to interoperate with other Digital database tools and application frameworks such as the Application Control Management System, Datatrieve and the Common Data Dictionary. It originally provided a proprietary query interface known as the Relational Data Operator (RDO), but later gained support for ANSI SQL.

In 1994 DEC sold the Rdb division to Oracle Corporation where it was rebranded Oracle Rdb. As of 2020, Oracle is still actively developing Rdb, with over half of the codebase developed under Oracle&#x27;s ownership. Version 7.0 ran on OpenVMS for VAX and Alpha, version 7.1 on Alpha only, and versions 7.2 to 7.4 on Alpha and IA-64 (Itanium).

Rdb featured one of the first cost-based optimizers, and after acquisition Oracle introduced a cost-based optimizer in its regular Oracle RDBMS product.

On March 22, 2011, Oracle announced it had decided to end all software development on the Itanium, and that Oracle Rdb 7.3 would be the last major version released by Oracle. Due to a lawsuit filed by HP against Oracle, Oracle was ordered to continue porting its software to Itanium computers for as long as HP (now Hewlett Packard Enterprise) sells Itanium computers.

Despite the announcement that 7.3 would be the last major release, Oracle released version 7.4.1.0 of Rdb in August 2020 for OpenVMS on both Alpha and Itanium. In November 2020, Oracle announced that they are in the process of porting Rdb 7.4 to the x86-64 port of OpenVMS.

==Data access==
Interactive access to the Oracle Rdb can be by SQL (Structured Query Language), RDO (Relational Database Operator), or both.

High level languages usually access Oracle-Rdb by:

#embedding RDO statements in the source file then running it through a precompiler
#:(example: &quot;file.RCO&quot; is pre-compiled into &quot;file.COB&quot;)
#embedding SQL statements in the source file then running it through a precompiler
#:(example: &quot;file.SCO&quot; is pre-compiled into &quot;file.COB&quot;)
#placing the SQL statements in a file external to the source code; this separate file is converted to object code by the &quot;SQL Module Language&quot; compiler, and the source code then references these SQL statements and, after compilation, the two are joined by the OpenVMS linker.
 example: $ SQL$MOD file_bas.sqlmod → file_bas.obj
 $ BASIC file.bas → file.obj
 $ LINK file.obj,file_bas.obj → file.exe

A variation of example 3 allows &quot;Dynamic SQL&quot; to be created in the source code, and then used to communicate with Rdb via a structure known as SQLDA (SQL Descriptor Area).

On OpenVMS systems, Oracle Rdb is a popular (although expensive) upgrade path for applications written using Record Management Services (RMS) files.

==Architecture==

Rdb is built on top of a low-level database kernel named KODA, which handles functionality such as locking, journaling, and buffering of data. The KODA kernel is shared with Oracle&#x27;s CODASYL DBMS (originally known as VAX DBMS) which is a network model database.

==Rdb on other platforms==

VAX Rdb/ELN was the name of Digital&#x27;s relational database for the VAXELN operating system. Despite sharing the Rdb name, and being announced at the same time, Rdb/ELN was not based on Rdb/VMS, or vice versa. Rdb/ELN was created by Jim Starkey, and was the first commercially available database to use Multiversion concurrency control.

Ports of Rdb previously existed or were planned for Tru64 and Microsoft Windows NT. Demand for the Tru64 version was so low that support was dropped. The Windows NT port was never released as Oracle could not obtain support on the BLISS compiler necessary for this platform. In order to port Rdb to these platforms, an abstraction layer named the Common Operating System Interface (COSI) was implemented to isolate the database from the underlying operating system.

Digital provided a relational database for their Ultrix operating system named ULTRIX/SQL, but it was based on Ingres instead of Rdb.

<text>Annoyance is an unpleasant mental state that is characterized by irritation and distraction from one&#x27;s conscious thinking. It can lead to emotions such as frustration and anger. The property of being easily annoyed is called irritability.

==Psychology==
Various reasons exist for why one finds particular stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As an attempt at measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects&#x27; own ratings of levels of annoyance on a scale. Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly. Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure. One can often encounter annoyance factors in media, including popular music, memes, commercials, and advertising jingles, which by their nature are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months.

A study published in the &quot;International Journal of Conflict Management&quot; found that one&#x27;s response to an annoyance, at least when the perceived cause is another person, escalate to more extreme levels as they go unresolved. It also found that one was more likely to blame the party who was causing the annoyance in the study, rather than one&#x27;s self, for the annoyance as it escalated.

Psychological warfare can involve creating annoyances to distract and wear down the resistance of the target. For example, in 1993, the United States&#x27; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) played music &quot;specifically selected for its irritation ability&quot; on loudspeakers outside the Branch Davidian church in Waco, Texas in an attempt to bring about the surrender of David Koresh and his followers.

==English law==
In the sense of &quot;nuisance&quot;, the noun &quot;annoyance&quot; is found in the English &quot;Jury of Annoyance&quot; appointed by an act of 1754 to report upon obstructions in the highways.

<doc id="911848" wikidata="Q258498" url="?curid=911848" title="Wendy O. Williams">
<text>Wendy Orlean Williams (May 28, 1949 – April 6, 1998) was an American singer, best known as the lead singer of the punk rock band Plasmatics. She was noted for her onstage theatrics, which included partial nudity, exploding equipment, firing a shotgun, and chainsawing guitars. Performing her own stunts in videos, she often sported a mohawk hairstyle. In 1985, during the height of her popularity as a solo artist, she was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

Williams left home at 16 and hitchhiked to Colorado, earning money by crocheting string bikinis. She traveled to Florida and Europe landing various jobs such as lifeguard, stripper, macrobiotic cook, and server at Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. After arriving in New York City in 1976, she began performing in live sex shows and in 1979 appeared in the pornographic film &quot;Candy Goes to Hollywood&quot;. That year manager Rod Swenson recruited her to the Plasmatics, and the two became romantically involved. The band quickly became known on the local underground scene, performing at clubs such as CBGB.

Three albums with Plasmatics later, Williams embarked on a solo career and released her debut album, &quot;WOW&quot;, in 1984. Albums &quot;Kommander of Kaos&quot; (1986) and &quot;Deffest! and Baddest!&quot; (1988) followed, before her retirement from the music industry. Williams made her non-adult film screen debut in Tom DeSimone&#x27;s film &quot;Reform School Girls&quot; (1986), for which she recorded the title song. She also appeared in the 1989 comedy &quot;Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog&quot; and the television series &quot;The New Adventures of Beans Baxter&quot; and &quot;MacGyver&quot;. On April 6, 1998, Williams fatally shot herself near her home in Storrs, Connecticut. She had attempted suicide twice in the years leading up to her death; allegedly she had also been struggling with deep depression.

== Life and career ==

=== 1949–1976: Early life ===
Williams was born to Robert F. Williams, a chemist at Eastman Kodak, and Audrey Stauber Williams (1921–2008) on May 28, 1949, in Webster, New York. She studied clarinet at the Community Music School program of the University of Rochester&#x27;s Eastman School of Music, and later was a clarinetist in her high school&#x27;s concert band. At the age of six, she appeared tap-dancing on the &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show as a member of the &quot;Peanut Gallery&quot;.

She had her first run-in with the law at the age of 15, when she was arrested for sunbathing nude. Williams attended R. L. Thomas High School in Webster at least partway through the 10th grade, but left school before graduating. Her schoolmates and teachers recalled Williams as a &quot;shy and pretty girl, an average student who played in the junior high band, paid attention to her hair and clothes, and who spoke so softly ... you had to lean toward her to hear her.&quot;

At the age of 16, Williams left her home and hitchhiked to Colorado where she earned money by selling crocheted string bikinis. Afterward, she headed for Florida, working as a lifeguard, and then to Europe, where she worked as a macrobiotic cook in London and as a dancer with a traveling dance troupe. Around that time, she was arrested on multiple occasions for shoplifting and passing counterfeit money.

In 1976, Williams arrived in New York City, where she saw an ad in the &quot;Show Business&quot; magazine that lay open on the floor of the Port Authority Bus Terminal station. It was a casting call for radical artist and Yale University graduate Rod Swenson&#x27;s experimental &quot;Captain Kink&#x27;s Theatre&quot;. She replied to the ad and began performing in live sex shows. She later appeared in Gail Palmer&#x27;s adult film &quot;Candy Goes to Hollywood&quot; (1979), credited as Wendy Williams. She was featured as a performer on a parody of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; shooting ping pong balls across the set from her crotch.

=== 1977–1983: Plasmatics ===
By 1977, Swenson had become Williams&#x27;s manager and recruited her to join his newly formed punk rock band, Plasmatics. They made their debut in July 1978 at the Manhattan music club CBGB. The Plasmatics toured the world, although a concert in London was cancelled by the promoters due to safety reasons, causing the press to dub the band &quot;anarchists&quot;. During the shooting of an appearance on &quot;SCTV&quot; in 1981, studio heads decided they would not air Williams&#x27;s performance unless she changed out of a costume that revealed her nipples. Williams refused. The show&#x27;s make-up artists found a compromise and painted her breasts black.

In January 1981, police in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, arrested Williams for simulating masturbation on stage and charged her with battery to an officer and obscene conduct. She was cleared of all charges. Later that year in Cleveland, Ohio, Williams was acquitted of an obscenity charge for simulating sex on stage wearing only shaving cream; she subsequently covered her nipples with electrical tape to avoid arrest. In November, an Illinois judge sentenced her to one year&#x27;s supervision and fined her $35 for attacking a freelance photographer who tried to take her picture as she jogged along the Chicago lakefront.

=== 1984–1986: Solo career, &quot;WOW&quot; and &quot;Kommander of Kaos&quot;===
Williams recorded a duet of the country hit &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; with Lemmy of Motörhead in 1982. In 1984, she released the &quot;W.O.W.&quot; album, produced by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Kiss members Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley, and Eric Carr, also perform on the album. Gene Simmons brought in Michael Ray to play lead guitar; Ray was previously auditioning on Creatures of the Night studio solos. Simmons himself played bass but is credited as Reginald Van Helsing. In 1985 Williams starred in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; at the Westport Playhouse in St. Louis. The show played for over six months, but a nationwide tour fell through.

In 1986, she starred in Tom DeSimone&#x27;s indie-film &quot;Reform School Girls&quot;. Neither she nor manager Rod Swenson liked the film when it came out, but at this point the producers had heard &quot;Kommander of Kaos&quot; (her second solo album) and wanted to include three tracks from the album in the movie score. They approached Swenson about producing the title track for the film and having Williams sing it. The band reluctantly agreed to do it. Uncle Brian from the Broc joined Swenson as co-producer and also played sax. He also appeared in the video that the film company had asked Swenson to produce and direct, playing the sax and wearing a tutu.

=== 1987–1990: Reunion with Plasmatics and &quot;Deffest! and Baddest!&quot; ===
In 1987, Williams starred as the part-time friend/enemy in the underground spy world to the title character on Fox&#x27;s &quot;The New Adventures of Beans Baxter&quot;. The Plasmatics&#x27; last tour was in late 1988. Williams appeared in &quot;Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog&quot;, directed by Paul S. Parco, in 1990.

In 1988, Williams put out another solo album, this time a &quot;thrash rap&quot; album called &quot;Deffest! and Baddest!&quot; under the name &quot;Ultrafly and the Hometown Girls.&quot;

Williams&#x27; last known performance of a Plasmatics song occurred due to the prompting of Joey Ramone. She performed &quot;Masterplan&quot; one final time with Richie Stotts, when Stotts&#x27; band opened for the Ramones on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1988.

=== 1991–1998: Retirement and final years ===
In 1991, Williams moved to Storrs, Connecticut, where she lived with her long-time companion and former manager, Rod Swenson, and worked as an animal rehabilitator and at a food cooperative in nearby Willimantic. She explained her move by saying that she &quot;was pretty fed up dealing with people.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Her teachers and other sources described Wendy Williams as a shy and soft-spoken child who was an average student, and who learned to play the clarinet very well in the junior high band—-although she herself at numerous times stated that she felt like an outcast and was misunderstood by her strict parents, whom she referred to as &quot;cocktail zombies&quot;. Swenson recalled in an interview how Wendy told him there were attempts to have her institutionalised after she became a rebellious teenager. She was said to have &quot;experimented with drugs and furious sex&quot; in her teenage years (though years later as an adult woman in 1979 into the early 1980s she would go on to become a &quot;teetotaler&quot;, in the words of her partner).

While making the transition into early adulthood, after running away from her family at the age of 16 and leaving the U.S. to explore the world for several years, for a time Williams became interested in Far Eastern spirituality, religions, and gurus as well as experimenting with mind-altering substances like LSD and mescaline. She continued to try different jobs and lifestyles in order to discover somewhere where she felt she belonged, until eventually finding the show-business magazine ad for Rod Swenson&#x27;s Sex Fantasy Theater in 1976—he would go on to form and manage their band, the &quot;Plasmatics&quot;; the two remained lifelong romantic partners until her suicide in 1998. Williams was strictly against sexism in the rock scene. Throughout her musical career, many of her songs featured anti-consumerist and anti-establishment messages. Swenson claims that Williams and he agreed together that they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to do things that sold, they wanted to do things that were interesting, new territory&quot;.

A vegetarian from 1966 until her death, Williams believed in leading a healthy lifestyle and aiming for self-improvement. She was once featured on the cover of the &quot;Vegetarian Times&quot;. In her later years, she gave up smoking (which she felt very strongly about and would not allow anyone to smoke in her changing rooms) as well as eventually stopping drinking entirely and never using any other drugs; she also became strongly opposed to the high sugar content in easily available processed foods. Swenson recalls that: &quot;Wendy was a consummate professional, always working on her craft, working on the show. She would work out hours every day, she would run six miles a day. She was a total vegetarian, totally into health food. When we were on the road, she always made sure the band was well fed. No processed meats, no white bread&quot;. She was known for refusing to wear makeup products manufactured by companies that used animals for laboratory experimentation and she was completely against needless poaching. After leaving the music scene, Swenson and Williams moved to Storrs, Connecticut, in 1991 to live in the geodesic dome house that they built for each other. Williams worked at a food co-op and became a wildlife rehabilitator to help animals, which she loved since her childhood as she was known for taking in and helping wounded wild animals as a child.

Williams once described herself as a &quot;marginal nymphomaniac and terminal exhibitionist&quot;. Several sources state that she was struggling with deep depression for many years before her death, as the two suicide attempts prior to her death also indicate. Although some have retroactively referred to her as straight edge, and her lifestyle supports this as she never used drugs and stopped drinking/smoking at a certain point in her life, there is no known evidence to suggest that Williams identified as such. When Williams was promoting &quot;Kommander of Kaos&quot; during a televised interview with Joan Rivers, Rivers said Williams&#x27; favorite movie is &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; – which could either be a true statement or a simple reference to the Plasmatics&#x27; onstage stunts at their concerts, that regularly involved acts of destruction and chainsawing through guitars. In several interviews, Williams spoke about her passion for tattoos. On her brief appearance in the adult film &quot;Candy Goes to Hollywood&quot;, Williams was quoted as saying: &quot;It was just like working in a donut shop, except you didn&#x27;t wear a paper hat&quot;.

== Death ==
Williams first attempted suicide in 1993 by hammering a knife into her chest where it lodged in her sternum. However, she changed her mind and called Rod Swenson to take her to the hospital. She attempted suicide again in 1997 with an overdose of ephedrine.

Williams died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 6, 1998, when she was 48. Swenson, her partner for more than 20 years, returned to their home in the area where they had lived since moving to Connecticut from New York City. He found a package she left for him that contained some noodles he liked, a packet of seeds for growing garden greens, some Oriental massage balm, and sealed letters from her.

The suicide letters, which included a &quot;living will&quot; denying life support, a love letter to Swenson and various lists of things to do, caused Swenson to begin searching the woods for her. After about an hour, as dusk fell, he found her body in a wooded area with a pistol lying on the ground nearby. She had apparently been feeding wild squirrels moments before her suicide, as well as putting a bag over her head before shooting herself to spare her partner the horrible sight. &quot;Wendy&#x27;s act was not an irrational in-the-moment act,&quot; he said; for four years she had contemplated suicide. Swenson reportedly described her as &quot;despondent&quot; at the time of her death. This is what she reportedly wrote in a suicide note regarding her decision:

Joey Ramone and many others issued statements at the time of her death. On Motörhead&#x27;s 1999 live album &quot;Everything Louder Than Everyone Else&quot;, before the song &quot;No Class&quot;, Motörhead vocalist Lemmy said that he wanted to dedicate the song to her.

A memorial was held at CBGB on May 18. Several of Williams&#x27; former Plasmatics co-members (Chosei Funahara, Richie Stotts, Wes Beech, Stu Deutsch, Jean Beauvoir and TC Tolliver) played a six-song set with four of them handling the vocals.

<text>Wang Baoxiang (; 190912 February 1977), was a Chinese mystery, science fiction, and wuxia romance novelist who wrote under the pseudonym Wang Dulu (). Wang is also known by the courtesy name Xiaoyu ().

In the West he is best known for his series of interlinked novels, the &quot;Crane-Iron Series&quot;, which includes &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;. The novel has been adapted to film and television several times, most notably the award-winning film adaptation of the same name directed by Ang Lee.

== Early life ==
Wang was born in 1909 in Beijing to a poor family of Bannerman background. (His ancestors were ethnic Han Chinese adopted into the Manchu Eight Banners.) He worked as an editor for a newspaper agency, and as a clerk for a merchant association before becoming a writer. He is reported to have been self-educated. However, he graduated high school in 1924, and worked infrequently as a teacher until he moved to Beijing in 1931. He also worked as freelance editor and journalist.

He and Li Danquan were married in 1935. They had three children. Some sources credit Li as a working as journalist or editor at &quot;Minyabao&quot; (), a daily newspaper, where Wang also worked.

== Career ==
Wang wrote more than twenty novels from 1931 to 1949, though some sources attribute as many fifty novels to him. Most of his earlier works were detective and mystery novels.

He began writing wuxia novels after moving to Qingdao, sometime before 1938. From 1939 to 1949, Wang produced as many as thirty-six wuxia novels.

=== &quot;Crane-Iron Series&quot; ===
Wang&#x27;s most popular works are collectively referred to as the &quot;Crane-Iron Series&quot; (), named after the first characters in the titles of the first and last installments in the series. The series&#x27; five novels chronicle the struggles of four generations of youxia (), often translated as wandering heroes. Each novel contains elements which link it with the others.

Portions or possibly all of the novels may have been serialized. The following titles are arranged in internal chronological order rather than by their publication date:
# &quot;Crane Startles Kunlun&quot; (, serialized title 1940–1941)
# &quot;Precious Sword, Golden Hairpin&quot; (, serialized title 1938–1939; collected edition 1939)
# &quot;Sword Force, Pearl Shine&quot; (, serialized titled 1939–1940; collected edition 1941)
# &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (, serialized title 1941–1942; collected edition 1948)
# &quot;Iron Knight, Silver Vase&quot; (, serialized title 1942–1944; collected edition 1948)

&quot;Crane Startles Kunlun&quot; was written third, after &quot;Sword Force, Pearl Shine&quot;, and serialized under the title &quot;Dancing Crane, Singing Luan&quot; (). The official website of actress Michelle Yeoh includes an English-language summary of the series.

=== Translations ===
The two first volumes were translated into French, and published by Calmann-Lévy. As of 2023, no official English language translations of his novels exist. However, there is a manhua series of the same name (and a second, revised edition), created by Andy Seto. The plot of the manhua departs substantially from the novels.

An unofficial English translation of &quot;Crane Startles Kunlun&quot; exists, and an unofficial translation is currently in progress for &quot;Precious Sword, Golden Hairpin&quot;.

=== Adaptations ===
Ang Lee&#x27;s 2000 film adaptation, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, included elements from other books in the &quot;Crane&quot; series, and also took liberties with the novel it was based on. The changes emphasized the romantic relationships between the protagonists from the novel. The film was also pitched as a martial-arts adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; by Jane Austen.

In 2013, The Weinstein Company announced an English-language adaptation of &quot;Iron Knight, Silver Vase&quot; was in development, with Ronny Yu attached to direct. The film was later renamed &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny&quot;, and principal photography began in August 2014, with Yuen Woo-ping as director.

== Later life and death ==
After the Chinese Civil War, Wang was assigned to work as a school teacher by Communist leaders, who labelled him an &quot;old literati&quot;. He was forbidden from producing new works. Following his retirement, possibly around 1966, he was labelled a &quot;reactionary literati&quot;, thus the Communist Party punitively sentenced him to farm labor.

He died from an unknown illness on 12 February 1977. Prior to his death he made several attempts to return to his wife and family who were living in Shenyang.

In 1999, Wang&#x27;s widow Ms. Li Dan Quan met with Ang Lee and Michelle Yeoh during the production of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.

<text>Edward Griffith (1790–1858) was a British naturalist and solicitor. He wrote &quot;General and Particular Descriptions of the Vertebrated Animals&quot; (1821) and translated Georges Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Règne animal&quot;, making considerable additions (1827–35).

==Life==
The son of William Griffith of Stanwell, Middlesex, he entered St. Paul&#x27;s School, London in 1800 and left it in 1806, entering the Common Pleas office as a clerk. He afterwards became a solicitor and a master in the Court of Common Pleas. He was one of the original members of the Zoological Society, and a fellow of the Linnean (1822), Antiquaries, and Royal Societies. Griffith died on 8 January 1858.

==Works==

In 1821 he published the first part of what was intended to be an extensive work, ‘General and Particular Descriptions of the Vertebrated Animals,’ with coloured plates. This first part dealt only with monkeys and lemurs. Incomplete, it may have been abandoned in favour of his translation of Cuvier&#x27;s ‘Animal Kingdom,’ with considerable additions, in fifteen volumes. This work, which is described as containing ‘descriptions of all the species hitherto named and of many not before noticed,’ was published between 1827 and 1834, Griffith being the chief editor, assisted by Major Charles Hamilton Smith and Edward Pidgeon in the part dealing with the mammalia, by Edward Pidgeon with the mollusca, by John Edward Gray with birds. and by George Robert Gray with insects. The work is extensively illustrated with coloured plates. It introduces many new names.

In addition to scientific works, Griffith published two others of a professional character. The first was ‘A Collection of Ancient Records relating to the Borough of Huntingdon, with Observations illustrative of the History of Parliamentary Boroughs in General,’ London, 1827 [misprinted 1727], arising out of an election petition, and urging that the borough franchise rightly belonged to all burgesses or resident householders paying scot and lot, and not, as held by a parliamentary committee, to the corporation. The other, published in 1831, is entitled &quot;Cases of supposed Exemption from Poor Rates claimed on the ground of Extraparochiality, with a … Sketch of the Ancient History of the Parish of St. Andrew, Holborn&quot;.

<text>Trouw (; ) is a Dutch daily newspaper appearing in compact size. It was founded in 1943 as an orthodox Protestant underground newspaper during World War II. Since 2009, it has been owned by DPG Media (known as De Persgroep until 2019). &quot;Trouw&quot; received the European Newspaper Award in 2012. Cees van der Laan is the current editor-in-chief.

==History==
&quot;Trouw&quot; is a Dutch word meaning &quot;fidelity&quot;, &quot;loyalty&quot;, or &quot;allegiance&quot;, and is cognate with the English adjective &quot;true&quot;. The name was chosen to reflect allegiance and loyalty to God and country in spite of the German occupation of the Netherlands.

&quot;Trouw&quot; was started during World War II by members of the Dutch Protestant resistance against the German occupation. Hundreds of people involved in the production and distribution of the newspaper were arrested and killed during the war. The newspaper was published irregularly during the war due to lack of paper. In 1944 the German forces tried to stop publication by rounding up and imprisoning some 23 of the couriers. They issued an ultimatum to the leaders of &quot;Trouw&quot;; however, the editors did not give in and all of the captured couriers were executed. Amongst the people that lost their life during the war due to their involvement with the newspaper was Trouw co-founder and resistance member .

After the war the paper became a daily, its allegiance to the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. By 1967, though, the paper&#x27;s chief editor made it clear that &quot;Trouw&quot; was not to be considered a paper only for Christians: it wanted to be a paper for everyone. In the course of time the percentage of &quot;Trouw&quot; readers that belong to the Reformed churches shrank considerably: in 1965 69% of readers belonged to one of those churches, but by 1979 this had dropped to 48%, and by 1999 to 28%. In their own words, in 2005, they intended to &quot;remain a newspaper rooted in a Christian tradition and to be a source of contemplation and inspiration for everyone, churchgoer or not, who feels a need for moral and spiritual orientation.&quot;

Circulation at the end of the 20th century was a little over 133,000. On 3 February 2005, &quot;Trouw&quot; changed its format from broadsheet to compact. 

Currently, &quot;Trouw&quot; is a part of the De Persgroep Nederland, the name given to the former PCM group after the Belgian publishing house De Persgroep bought a majority stake in PCM in the summer of 2009. &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot;, &quot;Het AD&quot;, &quot;Het Parool&quot; and &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; are also owned by De Persgroep Nederland. NRC Handelsblad was sold before the summer of 2010.

<doc id="911882" wikidata="Q284362" url="?curid=911882" title="How to Marry a Millionaire">
<text>How to Marry a Millionaire is a 1953 American romantic comedy film directed by Jean Negulesco and written and produced by Nunnally Johnson. The screenplay was based on the plays &quot;The Greeks Had a Word for It&quot; (1930) by Zoe Akins and &quot;Loco&quot; (1946) by Dale Eunson and Katherine Albert.

It stars Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Lauren Bacall as three fashionable Manhattan models, along with William Powell, David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, and Cameron Mitchell as their wealthy marks.

Produced and distributed by 20th Century-Fox, &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; was the studio&#x27;s first film to be shot in the new CinemaScope wide-screen sound process, although it was the second CinemaScope film released by Fox after the biblical epic film &quot;The Robe&quot; (also 1953). It was also the first color and CinemaScope film ever shown on prime-time network television (though panned-and-scanned) when it was presented as the first film on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; on September 23, 1961.

The soundtrack to &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; was released on CD by Film Score Monthly on March 15, 2001.

==Plot==

Resourceful Schatze Page, spunky Loco Dempsey, and ditzy Pola Debevoise are three women on a mission: each wants to marry a millionaire. To accomplish this task, they rent a luxurious Sutton Place penthouse in New York City from Freddie Denmark (who is avoiding the IRS by living in Europe) and together hatch a plot to court the city&#x27;s elite. On the day they move in, Loco arrives with Tom Brookman, who purchases her groceries for her because she &quot;forgot her pocketbook&quot;. Tom shows interest in Schatze but she dismisses him, stating that &quot;The first rule is, gentlemen callers have got to wear a necktie&quot; and, instead, sets her sights on the charming, classy, rich widower J.D. Hanley. While courting the older J.D., she fends off Tom, who eventually wins her over. After every date, she insists she never wants to see him again.

Meanwhile, Loco meets grumpy businessman Walter Brewster. He is married, but she agrees to accompany him to his lodge in Maine, thinking it is a convention hall of the Elks Club. Just as Loco discovers her mistake, she comes down with the measles and is quarantined. Upon recovering, while Brewster is now bedridden with measles, she begins seeing the forest ranger, Eben Salem. Loco mistakenly believes Salem is a wealthy landowner instead of a civil servant overseeing acres of forestlands. She is disappointed, telling off Brewster on the drive back to New York.
Pola is myopic but hates wearing glasses in the presence of men. She falls for a phony oil tycoon, J. Stewart Merrill, unaware that he is a crooked speculator. When she takes a plane from LaGuardia Airport to meet him in Atlantic City, she ends up on the wrong plane to Kansas City. On the plane, she encounters the mysterious Freddie Denmark again, having unknowingly met him when he entered his apartment to retrieve his tax documents as proof that his crooked accountant stole his money and left him in trouble with the IRS. Freddie also wears glasses and encourages Pola to wear hers as well. They fall quickly in love and get married.

Loco and Pola are reunited with Schatze just before her wedding to J.D. Hanley. Schatze is unable to go through with the marriage and confesses to J.D. that she loves Tom. He agrees to call off the ceremony. Tom is among the wedding guests and the two reconcile and marry. Afterwards, the three happy couples end up at a greasy spoon diner. Schatze jokingly asks Eben and Freddie about their financial prospects, which are slim. When she finally gets around to Tom, he casually admits a net worth of around $200 million, which no one takes seriously. He then calls for the check, pulls out an enormous wad of money, and pays with a $1,000 bill, telling the chef to keep the change. The three astonished women faint, and the men drink a toast to their unconscious wives.

==Production==
Nunnally Johnson, who adapted the screenplay from two different plays, produced the picture.

20th Century-Fox started production on &quot;The Robe&quot; before it began &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;. Although the latter was completed first, the studio chose to present &quot;The Robe&quot; as its first CinemaScope picture in late September or early October 1953 because it felt the family-friendly &quot;The Robe&quot; would attract a larger audience to its new widescreen process.

The film&#x27;s cinematography was by Joseph MacDonald. The costume design was by Travilla.

===Portrayal of New York===
Between scenes, the cinematography has some iconic color views of mid-20th century New York City: Rockefeller Center, Central Park, the United Nations Building, and Brooklyn Bridge in the opening sequence following the credits. Other iconic views include the Empire State Building, the lights of Times Square at night and the George Washington Bridge.

===Music===

A song extolling the virtues of New York follows the Gershwin-like music used for the title credits, after an elaborate five-minute pre-credit sequence showcasing a 70-piece orchestra conducted by Alfred Newman before the curtain goes up.

The score for &quot;How To Marry a Millionaire&quot; was one of the first recorded for film in stereo. It was composed and directed by Alfred Newman, with incidental music by Cyril Mockridge, and orchestrated by Edward B. Powell. The album was released on CD by Film Score Monthly on March 15, 2001 as part of their series &quot;Golden Age Classics&quot;.

The film&#x27;s theatrical version begins with a nearly six-minute overture of Newman&#x27;s symphonic piece &quot;Street Scene&quot;, which he wrote in the style of George Gershwin. It is played on-screen by an 80-piece studio orchestra (billed as &quot;The Twentieth Century Fox Symphony Orchestra&quot;). Newman wrote the piece for the 1931 film Street Scene, which featured his first complete film score.

==Release==

===Release and box office===
The film premiered at the Fox Wilshire Theatre (now the Saban Theatre), in Beverly Hills, California on November 4, 1953. It was a box office success, earning $8 million worldwide and $7.5 million domestically, second that year only to &quot;The Robe&quot;. It was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1953, whereas Monroe&#x27;s previous feature, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, was seventh.

==Critical response==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Bosley Crowther wrote &quot;the substance is still insufficient for the vast spread of screen which CinemaScope throws across the front of the theatre, and the impression it leaves is that of nonsense from a few people in a great big hall.&quot;

===Award nominations===
==Television adaptation==
In 1957, the film was adapted into a sitcom also titled &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;. It starred Barbara Eden (as Loco Jones), Merry Anders (Michelle &quot;Mike&quot; Page), Lori Nelson (Greta Lindquist) and as Nelson&#x27;s later replacement, Lisa Gaye as Gwen Kirby. It aired in syndication for two seasons.

==Remake==
In 2000, 20th Century Fox Television produced a made-for-TV remake, &quot;How to Marry a Billionaire: A Christmas Tale&quot;. It reversed the sex roles, and had three men looking to marry wealthy women. It starred John Stamos, Joshua Malina and Shemar Moore.

In 2007, Nicole Kidman bought the rights to &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; under her production company Blossom Films, intending to produce and possibly star in a remake.

<doc id="911884" wikidata="Q222926" url="?curid=911884" title="Comedy of manners">
<text>In English literature, the term comedy of manners (also anti-sentimental comedy) describes a genre of realistic, satirical comedy of the Restoration period (1660–1710) that questions and comments upon the manners and social conventions of a greatly sophisticated, artificial society. The satire of fashion, manners, and outlook on life of the social classes, is realised with stock characters, such as the braggart soldier of Ancient Greek comedy, and the fop and the rake of English Restoration comedy. The clever plot of a comedy of manners (usually a scandal) is secondary to the social commentary thematically presented through the witty dialogue of the characters, e.g. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1895), by Oscar Wilde, which satirises the sexual hypocrisies of Victorian morality.

The comedy-of-manners genre originated in the New Comedy period (325–260 BC) of Classical Greece (510–323 BC), and is known from fragments of works by the playwright Menander, whose style of writing, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by Roman playwrights, such as Plautus and Terence, whose comedies were known to and staged during the Renaissance. In the 17th century, the comedy of manners is best realised in the plays of Molière, such as &quot;The School for Wives&quot; (1662), &quot;The Imposter&quot; (1664), and &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; (1666), which satirise the hypocrisies and pretensions of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; that ruled France from the late 15th century to the 18th century.

== Early examples ==
The comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. Horace&#x27;s Satire 1.9 is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.

William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot; might be considered the first comedy of manners In England, but the genre really flourished during the Restoration period. Restoration comedy, which was influenced by Ben Jonson&#x27;s comedy of humours, made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time. The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of William Wycherley (&quot;The Country Wife&quot;, 1675) and William Congreve (&quot;The Way of the World&quot;, 1700). In the late 18th century Oliver Goldsmith (&quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, 1773) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan (&quot;The Rivals&quot;, 1775; &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, 1777) revived the form.

== More recent examples ==

The tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting, and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde in &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1892) and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists Noël Coward (&quot;Hay Fever&quot;, 1925) and Somerset Maugham. Other early twentieth-century examples of comedies of manners include George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s 1913 play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (later adapted into the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;), E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, and the Jeeves and Wooster stories of P. G. Wodehouse.

The term &quot;comedy of menace&quot;, which British drama critic Irving Wardle based on the subtitle of &quot;The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace&quot; (1958), by David Campton, is a jocular play-on-words derived from the &quot;comedy of manners&quot; (&quot;menace&quot; being &quot;manners&quot; pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent). Harold Pinter&#x27;s play &quot;The Homecoming&quot; has been described as a mid-twentieth-century &quot;comedy of manners&quot;.

Other more recent examples include Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, Barbara Pym&#x27;s &quot;Excellent Women&quot;, Douglas Carter Beane&#x27;s &quot;As Bees in Honey Drown&quot;, &quot;The Country Club&quot;, and &quot;The Little Dog Laughed&quot;. In &quot;Boston Marriage&quot; (1999), David Mamet chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme). Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class. Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.

Comedies of manners have been a staple of British film and television. The &quot;Carry On&quot; films are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners style, and elements of the style can be found in The Beatles&#x27; films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;. Television series by David Croft in collaboration with Jimmy Perry (&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;) and with Jeremy Lloyd (&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;) might also be considered examples of the genre. Television series such as &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, and &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; also contain many elements of the genre. Though less common as a genre in American television, series such as &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, &quot;Soap&quot;, and &quot;The Nanny&quot; are also comedies of manners. Larry David&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; has also been described as a comedy of manners.

<text>In computer graphics, metaballs, also known as blobby objects, are organic-looking &quot;n&quot;-dimensional isosurfaces, characterised by their ability to meld together when in close proximity to create single, contiguous objects.

In solid modelling, polygon meshes are commonly used. In certain instances, however, metaballs are superior. A metaball&#x27;s &quot;blobby&quot; appearance makes them versatile tools, often used to model organic objects and also to create base meshes for sculpting.

The technique for rendering metaballs was invented by Jim Blinn in the early 1980s to model atom interactions for Carl Sagan&#x27;s 1980 TV series &quot;&quot;. It is also referred to colloquially as the &quot;jelly effect&quot; in the motion and UX design community, commonly appearing in UI elements such as navigations and buttons. Metaball behavior corresponds to mitosis in cell biology, where chromosomes generate identical copies of themselves through cell division.

== Definition ==
Each metaball is defined as a function in &quot;n&quot; dimensions (e.g., for three dimensions, formula_1; three-dimensional metaballs tend to be most common, with two-dimensional implementations popular as well). A thresholding value is also chosen, to define a solid volume. Then,

formula_2

that is, all points larger than the threshold are inside the metaball.

As a more informal definition, consider two circles in 2D, and at point P, the influence of each circle is proportional to 1/distance from the circle&#x27;s center, with the influence at P being the sum of influences. If that sum equals the threshold at point P, then P is on the surface of the metaball. If the sum is greater than the threshold, P is inside the metaball.

== Implementation ==

A typical function chosen for metaballs is simply inverse distance, that is, the contribution to the thresholding function falls off asymptotically toward zero the distance from the centre of the metaball increases:
:formula_3
where formula_4 scales the magnitude of the contribution (changing the radius of a metaball) and formula_5 is the distance from the ball&#x27;s center, calculated from cartesian coordinates as: 

:formula_6
where formula_7 is the center of the metaball.

Various other falloff functions have historically been used for reasons of computational efficiency. Desirable properties of the function include:
* Finite support. A function with finite support goes to zero at a maximum radius. When evaluating the metaball field, any points beyond their maximum radius from the sample point can be ignored. Nearest neighbor search can ensure only adjacent metaballs need to be evaluated regardless of the total number in the field.
* Smoothness. Because the isosurface is the result of adding the fields together, its smoothness is dependent on the smoothness of the falloff curves.

More complicated models use an inverse square law, or a Gaussian potential constrained to a finite radius or a mixture of polynomials to achieve smoothness. The Soft Object model by the Wyvill brothers provides higher degree of smoothness.

A simple generalization of metaballs is to apply the falloff curve to distance-from-lines or distance-from-surfaces.

There are a number of ways to render the metaballs to the screen. In the case of three dimensional metaballs, the two most common are brute force raycasting and the marching cubes algorithm.

2D metaballs were a very common demo effect in the 1990s. The effect is also available as an XScreenSaver module.

<text>Florence Turner (January 6, 1885 – August 28, 1946) was an American actress who became known as the &quot;Vitagraph Girl&quot; in early silent films.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, Turner was pushed into appearing on the stage at age three by her ambitious mother. Turner became a regular performer in a variety of productions. In 1906, she joined the fledgling motion picture business, signing with the pioneering Vitagraph Studios and making her film debut in &quot;How to Cure a Cold&quot; (June 8, 1907).

At the time there were no stars per se, unless an already famous stage star made a movie. Performers were not even mentioned by name. Long, drawn-out screen credits were non-existent. There was nothing but the name of the company and the picture. As the content of movies evolved from simple incidents or situations into definite stories, some of the heroes and heroines were conceded a vague identity, such as the &quot;Edison Girl&quot;, or &quot;The Girl from Sheepshead Bay.&quot;
Though she was known only as the &quot;Vitagraph Girl&quot; in the early motion picture shorts, Turner became the most popular American actress to appear on screen (which at that time was still dominated by French pictures, especially from the Pathe and Gaumont companies). Her worth to the studio, as its biggest box-office draw, was recognised in 1907 when her pay was upped to $22 a week, as proto-star plus part-time seamstress. It was somewhat less than the male leading players, especially those with stage experience, particularly the super-popular Maurice Costello. In March 1910, she and Florence Lawrence became the first screen actors not already famous in another medium to be publicized by name by their studios to the general public.

Later that year, Florence was paired several times with heartthrob Wallace Reid, who was on his way to stardom. But with the rise of more stars such as Gene Gauntier and Marin Sais at Kalem Studios, Marion Leonard and Mary Pickford at Biograph Studios, and Florence Lawrence (Biograph, moving to IMP in 1910), Florence Turner was no longer quite as special. By 1913 she was looking for new pastures and left the United States accompanied by longtime friend Laurence Trimble, who directed her in a number of movies. They moved to England, where she and Larry began performing together in London music halls.
Turner sometimes wrote screenplays and directed her own movies, including a number of comedies. She also organized her own production company, Turner Films, for which she made more than thirty shorts. These were shot at the Walton Studios of Cecil Hepworth, west of London.

Turner entertained Allied troops during World War I. She returned to the U.S. after the Armistice, but was not as successful as before. In 1920, she again went to England, where she remained until moving to Hollywood, virtually forgotten, in 1924.

By then she was thirty-nine years of age, and her starring days were long behind her. She continued to act in supporting roles into the 1930s.
In 1928, she acted in a minor role on Broadway in &quot;Sign of the Leopard&quot;, which ran for 39 performances. 

Turner was placed on the payroll at MGM by Louis B. Mayer in the 1930s, but was limited in the assignments offered. She mostly played bit or small parts and worked as an extra.

==Last years==
She later moved to the Motion Picture Country House, a retirement community for the industry in Woodland Hills, California. 

After appearing in more than 160 motion pictures, Turner died at the age of 61 in Woodland Hills. She was cremated at a mortuary in Hollywood and, at her request, there was no funeral service. Her ashes stored in vault 1 at Chapel of the Pines Crematory.

<text>The Polytechnic University of Turin (, abbreviated as PoliTO) is the oldest Italian public technical university. The university offers several courses in the fields of Engineering, Architecture, Urban Planning and Industrial Design, and is consistently ranked as one of the best universities in Italy and in the world. As of 2024, it is ranked (QS World University Rankings) 28th worldwide for Mechanical Engineering, 22nd for Petroleum Engineering, 21st for Architecture and is among the top 100 (52nd) engineering and technology universities in the world.

The Polytechnic University of Turin has its main campuses in the city of Turin, in the Piedmont region, where the majority of the research and teaching activities are located, as well as other satellite campuses in four other cities across the Piedmont region. With eleven departments and several research institutes, it has around 35,000 students (undergraduate and postgraduate) and 1,800 employees (teaching, research, support and management staff). The university was established in 1859 as a Technical School for Engineers. The school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1906. Politecnico di Torino is a member of several university federations, including the TIME, CESAER, and PEGASUS.

==History==
The &quot;Regio Politecnico di Torino&quot; (Royal Polytechnic University of Turin) was established in 1906. The present-day institution was preceded by the &quot;Scuola di Applicazione per gli Ingegneri&quot; (Technical School for Engineers), which was founded in 1859 in application of the Casati law, and the &quot;Museo Industriale Italiano&quot; (Italian Industry Museum) founded in 1862 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Industry. The Technical School for Engineers was part of the University, which led to technical studies being accepted as part of higher education. In those times Italy was about to begin a new industrial era, which the Industry Museum was to address more directly thanks to famous scholars and researchers dealing with new subjects such as electrotechnics and building science. The new school was deeply concerned with the needs of the Italian society and its development perspectives.

Like other well known Polytechnic Schools in the first years of the 20th century the Regio Politecnico di Torino had several goals and began contacting the European academic world and the Italian industry. Aeronautics began as a subject. Students from all over Italy came to Turin and found in the new laboratories built for the study of various subjects ranging from chemistry to architecture in a positive and helpful atmosphere. Subsequently, the Faculty of Engineering was transferred to a building, now disappeared, which occupied the entire block between via Giolitti, via San Francesco da Paola, via Cavour and via Accademia Albertina (the current Valdo Fusi square). During the Second World War, the plexus was severely damaged, and largely razed to the ground by a heavy bombing by the Royal Air Force, in the night between 8 and 9 December 1942.

Instead of rebuilding the Faculty of Engineering where it was, it was decided to move it and expand it in the Crocetta district, and in November 1958 a large complex of buildings located in Corso Duca degli Abruzzi was inaugurated in the vast area where the Turin Stadium had been built in 1911. The historical headquarters of Valentino Castle (Castello del Valentino) helped expanding the volume and the facilities given in 1859 to the Technical School for Engineers.

In the 1990s, new teaching campuses were opened in Alessandria, Biella, Ivrea and Mondovì. On 13 February 2012, the e-st@r, a small artificial satellite built to the standards of the CubeSat (nanosatellite cube) by the students of the Polytechnic of Turin, was carried into orbit by Vega, the pitcher of the European Space Agency.

==Campuses==
Campuses of the Politecnico di Torino draw inspiration from the structure of Anglo-Saxon ones, with multipurpose buildings for teaching, basis and applied research and services to the students in Turin, and a regional network of technological centers (Alessandria, Biella, Mondovì, Verrès), dedicated to research activities, technological transfer, specialist education and services to the region.

The historical and representative base of the Politecnico is in the town, on the River Po: the Valentino Castle, a House of Savoy of the 17th Century. It is the main teaching campus for Architecture and has an area of 23.000 sq. m. The big complex in corso Duca degli Abruzzi – with 122.000 sq. m., the main campus of Engineering – was opened in 1958 and it is completed by the Cittadella Politecnica: a modern complex of 170,000 sq. m. adjoining to the main building, including areas dedicated to students, research activities, technological transfer and services. The newest campus is the Design and Sustainable Mobility Citadel, in an area adjoining to the manufacturing establishment of Mirafiori, FIAT manufacturing facility which has been remodeled as well as the Lingotto building, which hosts the Master School. The headquarters on Oddino Morgari street is intended for the course in territorial, urban and landscape-environmental planning.

=== Museum ===

The &quot;Museo Archivio Politecnico&quot; (MAP) carries out historical documentation activities for the University and for scholars who intend to carry out research and studies on the development of Turin&#x27;s polytechnic culture, as well as the events that over the years have involved technical institutions and industry in Turin, Piedmont and Italy. The museum preserves and manages the historical materials of the University, such as: the historical archive of the students of the Polytechnic and a specialized library on the history of engineering, architecture and related institutions. It also carries out activities for the dissemination of scientific and technological culture with exhibitions, workshops and conferences.

<text>The University of Lethbridge (also known as uLethbridge, uLeth, and U of L) is a public comprehensive and research university located in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, with a second campus in Calgary, Alberta.

Founded in the liberal arts tradition, the university offers over 150 undergraduate degree programs in the Arts, Sciences, Management, Education, Health Sciences and Fine Arts. Further, the university has over 50 Masters and PhD programs. 

Ranked as one of the top primarily undergraduate universities in Canada by Maclean&#x27;s magazine, the university has a provincial economic impact of $2.0 billion. It is the second largest employer in the city of Lethbridge, with over 1,000 staff, including 600 academic staff. The student population consists of 7,528 undergraduates and 735 graduate students as of 2022. There are over 50,000 alumni around the world.

== History ==


Established by a provincial Order in Council as Alberta&#x27;s third university during a period of rapid population growth in the province. The University of Lethbridge welcomed 650 students when it first opened its doors in 1967 on the Lethbridge Junior College campus. With the completion of University Hall in 1971, the university moved permanently to west Lethbridge with enrolment growing to over 1,200 students. The current location of the university was chosen only after an intense community debate with the provincial government which wanted the university to be located in east Lethbridge. After the university&#x27;s first convocation on May 18, 1968, more than 500 students, faculty and community members held a protest march in support of having the university located in west Lethbridge. Soon after, the government decided west Lethbridge would be the university&#x27;s permanent location.

University Hall was designed by the renowned architect Arthur Erickson and sits within the coulees above the Oldman River. University Hall was selected as one of four buildings to appear on a Canadian postage stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC).

On February 10, 2022, the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association began its first ever legal strike action over issues such as working conditions, collegial governance, and equitable pay and benefits. The strike concluded on March 23, with the Faculty Association voting 91% in favour of a new collective agreement with the university lasting through June 2024.

== Art gallery ==
The University of Lethbridge Art Gallery was established in 1981 and houses one of the largest collections in Canada of 19th and 20th-century Canadian, American and European art, with over 13,000 pieces including drawing, print making, painting, photography, sculpture and installation.

The previous director, Jeffrey Spalding, spearheaded this nationally renowned art collection. Josephine Mills was appointed director/curator of the Art Gallery in 2001 and maintains a strong exhibition, publication, and research program.

The collection quickly outgrew available archiving and storage space, so a new building was completed in 1999 to house large works. Additional renovations were made in 2000 and 2003 to update a study area for the collection and an incoming/ outgoing art handling area.

In 2006, a comprehensive registration database was made available online of the University of Lethbridge collections.

<text>The Streletsky prikaz (), sometimes translated as the Streltsy Department, was one of the main governmental bodies (a &quot;prikaz&quot;) in Russia during the 16th and 17th centuries which administered the streltsy.

==History==
The first reference to the &quot;Streletsky prikaz&quot; appears in 1571, but in the mid-1550s, it already existed under the name of &quot;Streletskaya izba&quot; ().

The &quot;Streletsky prikaz&quot; was in charge of the Moscow and municipal streltsy, their lands and other properties, disbursement of their salary and bread allowances, and their cases in court. In 1672–1683, it also collected the taxes of the streltsy. After the streltsy uprising in 1698, the &quot;Streletsky prikaz&quot; was engaged in regular administrative and managerial matters. In 1701, it was transformed into the &quot;Prikaz zemskikh del&quot; (), inheriting the functions of the &quot;zemstvo&quot; police department in Moscow.

<text>Nevada Fall is a high waterfall on the Merced River in Yosemite National Park, California. It is located below the granite dome, Liberty Cap, at the west end of Little Yosemite Valley. The waterfall is widely recognized by its &quot;bent&quot; shape, in which the water free-falls for roughly the first third of its length to a steep slick-rock slope. This mid-fall impact of the water on the cliff face creates a turbulent, whitewater appearance in the fall and produces a great deal of mist which covers a wide radius, which led to its current name (&quot;Nevada&quot; is a Spanish word meaning &quot;snowy&quot;).

The Indian name was Yo-wy-we, signifying the twist or squirm of the falling water. Lafayette Bunnell suggested the name &quot;Nevada&quot; for the waterfall. He wrote, &quot;The Nevada Fall was so called because it was the nearest to the Sierra Nevada, and because the name was sufficiently indicative of a wintry companion for our spring (Vernal Fall)... The white, foaming water, as it dashed down Yo-wy-we from the snowy mountains, represented to my mind a vast avalanche of snow.&quot;

The Emerald Pool forms on the &quot;step&quot; between Nevada Fall and Vernal Fall downstream. The high Vernal Fall is a short hike from the bottom of Nevada Fall. They form a cascade in which the Merced River flows down to Yosemite Valley.

This cascade is sometimes called the &quot;giant staircase&quot;, which is evident when viewed from above, at Glacier Point.

The hike to the top of Nevada Fall, along the Mist Trail, is from the trailhead in Yosemite Valley. One must first hike to Vernal Fall and then trek another to reach the top. The John Muir Trail, which starts near the trail to Happy Isles, goes to the top of Nevada Fall.

== Hazards ==

In spite of the dangers and deaths as recently as June 2013, the pool above Nevada Fall remains a popular swimming location, with no park restrictions. In June 2018, an 18-year-old teenager fell to his death from the edge of the fall while attempting to take a selfie.

The Intercollegiate Horse Shows Association (IHSA) is a nonprofit organization composed of men and women of all riding levels and offers both individual and team competition. Members of the IHSA participate in horse shows. Students compete at eight levels, from beginner through advanced, with horses provided to them. The organisation was founded by Bob Cacchione in 1967 and currently has +10,000 members in 47 U.S. states and Canada. 400 colleges and universities participate in the program, where college and university team participation is represented through varsity athletics, academic departments and club sports.

An estimated 250,000 people have participated in the IHSA and contributes a significant percentage of membership to the U.S. Hunter Jumper Association (USHJA), the U.S. Equestrian Federation (USEF), the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) and the National Reining Horse Association (NRHA).

==Divisions==
Within the IHSA, riders compete as individuals and teams in English riding (hunter seat equitation, aka, &#x27;flat,&#x27; and over fences) or Western riding (Western horsemanship and reining). There are eight hunter seat levels total of nine classes including Introductory, Pre-Novice, Novice, Limit on the flat and over fences, Intermediate on the flat and over fences, and Open on the flat and over fences. Alumni on the flat and Alumni over fences may be offered.

For the Hunter Seat divisions, over fences, the Limit division jumps are set at 2’ to 2’3”, Intermediate jumps at 2’6” to 2’9” and Open jumps at 2’9” to 3’.

In Western Horsemanship, there are six levels: Beginner Western Horsemanship, Rookie A and B, Novice, Level I, Level II, Open and Open Reining. Alumni Horsemanship may be offered. 

==Judging==
In both Hunter Seat and Western divisions, riders are judged on their equitation, i.e., each rider is individually judged on their effectiveness in communicating with their horse, while maintaining proper form.

Individual ribbons correspond to points, which combine for a team score. Each team can have only one &#x27;point rider&#x27; per division and the lowest score on their card is dropped. A cumulative team score of 49 points for Hunter Seat or 42 points for Western would be a &#x27;perfect&#x27; card. A rider may only score a given number of points before they graduate to another level of riding experience. Points correspond as follows:

General Points Awarded through the Zone/Semi-Final Level:

Nationals Points Points will be counted as follows:
==Competition==
The IHSA divides the country into eight zones. Every zone is divided into regions, and each region ranges with approximately five to 15 collegiate teams. The teams within the region compete against each other in two to ten horse shows per year. 

An IHSA team organizes and hosts each show and invites other member colleges in its IHSA Region to compete. Competitors are not permitted to ride their own horses. IHSA show horses are provided by host stables or &quot;donated&quot; for the day from other teams, coaches, or area equestrian facilities. Each horse is warmed-up before classes begin by non-competing riders, while student competitors observe. Each rider is assigned a horse, through random selection, called the &quot;draw&quot; and partially through a matching of the horse&#x27;s abilities with those needed for horses participating in certain classes. Riders are not permitted to warm up their assigned horse except at the walk. 

Each place (first through sixth) has an assigned point value that accumulates throughout the seasons. When riders acquire 36 (or 28 for Open) points in their division, they qualify to compete in the Regional Finals competition. The top two riders in each class move to the Zone Finals and the top riders from Zones move on to Nationals. The high-point team (and in some zones, the top two teams) from each region also compete in Zones for the National Competition. At Nationals, both Hunter Seat and Western teams compete. 

Once a rider has qualified for IHSA Regionals in a division, they must compete the rest of the year in the next division. The one exception are Introductory and Beginner divisions. A rider is only allowed to remain in the Introductory or Beginner division for two years before moving up to the next division. 

== Zones ==
==Alumni and awards==
Its USEF/Cacchione Cup stars include U.S. Olympic Show Jumping medalists Greg Best, Beezie Madden, Peter Wylde, and U.S. Combined Training champion Mark Weissbecker.

The IHSA&#x27;s founder, Robert E. Cacchione, was awarded the IHSA Lifetime Achievement Award, the USHJA Presidents Distinguished Service Award, the 2011 US Equestrian/EQUUS Foundation Humanitarian Award, a Doctor of Humane Letters from Centenary College and the Zoetis/American Horse Publications Equine Industry Vision Award.

The IHSA official Facebook Page was recognized by the Equestrian Social Media Awards as a finalist and for the FEI Solidarity Award.

<doc id="911953" wikidata="Q1501943" url="?curid=911953" title="Turbidite">
<text>A turbidite is the geologic deposit of a turbidity current, which is a type of amalgamation of fluidal and sediment gravity flow responsible for distributing vast amounts of clastic sediment into the deep ocean.

==Sequencing==

Turbidites were first properly described by Arnold H. Bouma (1962), who studied deepwater sediments and recognized particular &quot;fining-up intervals&quot; within deep water, fine-grained shales, which were anomalous because they started at pebble conglomerates and terminated in shales. This was anomalous because within the deep ocean it had historically been assumed that there was no mechanism by which tractional flow could carry and deposit coarse-grained sediments into the abyssal depths.

Bouma cycles begin with an erosional contact of a coarse lower bed of pebble to granule conglomerate in a sandy matrix, and grade up through coarse then medium plane parallel sandstone; through cross-bedded sandstone; rippled cross-bedded sand/silty sand, and finally laminar siltstone and shale. This vertical succession of sedimentary structures, bedding, and changing lithology is representative of strong to waning flow regime currents and their corresponding sedimentation.

It is unusual to see all of a complete Bouma cycle, as successive turbidity currents may erode the unconsolidated upper sequences. Alternatively, the entire sequence may not be present depending on whether the exposed section was at the edge of the turbidity current lobe (where it may be present as a thin deposit), or upslope from the deposition centre and manifested as a scour channel filled with fine sands grading up into a pelagic ooze.

It is now recognized that the vertical progression of sedimentary structures described by Bouma applies to turbidites deposited by low-density turbidity currents. As the sand concentration of a flow increases, grain-to-grain collisions within the turbid suspension create dispersive pressures that become important in hindering further settling of grains. As a consequence, a slightly different set of sedimentary structures develops in turbidites deposited by high-density turbidity currents. This different set of structures is known as the Lowe sequence, which is a descriptive classification that complements, but does not replace, the Bouma sequence.

==Formation==

Turbidites are sediments which are transported and deposited by density flow, not by tractional or frictional flow.

The distinction is that, in a normal river or stream bed, particles of rock are carried along by frictional drag of water on the particle (known as &quot;tractional flow&quot;). The water must be travelling at a certain velocity in order to suspend the particle in the water and push it along. The greater the size or density of the particle relative to the fluid in which it is travelling, the higher the water velocity required to suspend it and transport it.

Density-based flow, however, occurs when liquefaction of sediment during transport causes a change to the density of the fluid. This is usually achieved by highly turbulent liquids which have a suspended load of fine grained particles forming a slurry. In this case, larger fragments of rock can be transported at water velocities too low to otherwise do so because of the lower density contrast (that is, the water plus sediment has a higher density than the water and is therefore closer to the density of the rock).

This condition occurs in many environments aside from simply the deep ocean, where turbidites are particularly well represented. Lahars on the side of volcanoes, mudslides and pyroclastic flows all create density-based flow situations and, especially in the latter, can create sequences which are strikingly similar to turbidites.

Turbidites in sediments can occur in carbonate as well as siliciclastic sequences.

Classic, low-density turbidites are characterized by graded bedding, current ripple marks, climbing ripple laminations, alternating sequences with pelagic sediments, distinct fauna changes between the turbidite and native pelagic sediments, sole markings, thick sediment sequences, regular bedding, and an absence of shallow-water features. A different vertical progression of sedimentary structures characterize high-density turbidites.

Massive accumulations of turbidites and other deep-water deposits may result in the formation of submarine fans. Sedimentary models of such fan systems typically are subdivided into upper, mid, and lower fan sequences each with distinct sand-body geometries, sediment distributions, and lithologic characteristics.

Turbidite deposits typically occur in foreland basins.

==Submarine fan models==
Submarine fan models are often based on source-to-sink [S2S] concepts linking sediment source areas, and sediment routing systems to the eventual depositional environments of turbidite deposits. They are aimed at providing insights into the relationships between different geologic processes and turbidite fan systems. 
Geologic processes influencing turbidite systems can either be of allogenic or autogenic origin and submarine fan models are designed to capture the impact of these processes on reservoir presence, reservoir distribution, morphology, and architecture of turbidite deposits. Some significant allogenic forcing includes the effect of sea level fluctuations, regional tectonic events, sediment supply type, sediment supply rate, and sediment concentration. Autogenic controls can include seafloor topography, confinements, and slope gradients. 
There are about 26 submarine fan models. Some common fan models include the classical single-source suprafan model, models depicting fans with attached lobes, detached lobes fan model, and submarine fan models relating to the response of turbidite systems to varying grain sizes and different feeder systems.
The integration of subsurface datasets such as 3D/4D seismic reflection, well logs, and core data as well as modern seafloor bathymetry studies, numerical forward stratigraphic modeling, and flume tank experiments are enabling improvements and more realistic development of submarine fan models across different basins.

==Importance==
Turbidites provide a mechanism for assigning a tectonic and depositional setting to ancient sedimentary sequences as they usually represent deep-water rocks formed offshore of a convergent margin, and generally require at least a sloping shelf and some form of tectonism to trigger density-based avalanches. Density currents may be triggered in areas of high sediment supply by gravitational failure alone. Turbidites can represent a high resolution record of seismicity, and terrestrial storm/flood events depending on the connectivity of canyon/channel systems to terrestrial sediment sources.

Turbidites from lakes and fjords are also important as they can provide chronologic evidence of the frequency of landslides and the earthquakes that presumably formed them, by dating using radiocarbon or varves above and below the turbidite.

==Economic importance==
Turbidite sequences are classic hosts for lode gold deposits, the prime example being Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria, Australia, where more than 2,600 tons of gold have been extracted from saddle-reef deposits hosted in shale sequences from a thick succession of Cambrian-Ordovician turbidites. Proterozoic gold deposits are also known from turbidite basin deposits.

Lithified accumulations of turbidite deposits may, in time, become hydrocarbon reservoirs and the petroleum industry makes strenuous efforts to predict the location, overall shape, and internal characteristics of these sediment bodies in order to efficiently develop fields as well as explore for new reserves.

<text>La Bola de Cristal () was a Spanish television show that was broadcast on La Primera Cadena of Televisión Española from 1984 to 1988.

The show was the brainchild of Spanish writer Dolores Rico Oliver (better known for her artistic name, Lolo Rico) and was hosted by pop singer Alaska. The program went beyond the norm set by the children&#x27;s programs of its time and other more current ones, and bet on treating children as adults, which earned it recognition of different sectors of society. The show, which was ostensibly targeted at a young audience, reflected the spirit of the times, that of the post-Franco Spanish transition and of the cultural and musical movement known as la movida.
In contrast to previous shows, with a very childish use of language, it had continuous puns related to electronics: the &quot;Electroduendes&quot; (&quot;Electrogoblins&quot;) puppets included &quot;Maese Cámara&quot; (Master Camera), &quot;Hada Vídeo&quot; (the Video Fairy) and &quot;Bruja Avería&quot; (the Breakdown Witch) as regular characters.

In one of its sections, they used to introduce an episode of classic American series. The first season included &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, the second season, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, and the third season, &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

&quot;La Bola de Cristal&quot; also included slogans against authority and capitalism, with political satires that led the show to its cancellation in 1988. Before the cancellation order, at least one new season of &quot;La Bola de Cristal&quot; was planned, with Sonia Martínez as new presenter.

Although it was never released on VHS video, in 2003 selected excerpts of the series were released on DVD. These DVDs did not feature episodes from &quot;The Munsters&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot; since they were copyrighted by their owners, but included episodes from &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;.

<text>Kripke semantics (also known as relational semantics or frame semantics, and often confused with possible world semantics) is a formal semantics for non-classical logic systems created in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Saul Kripke and André Joyal. It was first conceived for modal logics, and later adapted to intuitionistic logic and other non-classical systems. The development of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the theory of non-classical logics, because the model theory of such logics was almost non-existent before Kripke (algebraic semantics existed, but were considered &#x27;syntax in disguise&#x27;).

==Semantics of modal logic==
The language of propositional modal logic consists of a countably infinite set of propositional variables, a set of truth-functional connectives (in this article formula_1 and formula_2), and the modal operator formula_3 (&quot;necessarily&quot;). The modal operator formula_4 (&quot;possibly&quot;) is (classically) the dual of formula_3 and may be defined in terms of necessity like so: formula_6 (&quot;possibly A&quot; is defined as equivalent to &quot;not necessarily not A&quot;).

===Basic definitions===
A Kripke frame or modal frame is a pair formula_7, where &quot;W&quot; is a (possibly empty) set, and &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation on &quot;W&quot;. Elements
of &quot;W&quot; are called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;worlds&quot;, and &quot;R&quot; is known as the accessibility relation.

A Kripke model is a triple formula_8, where
formula_7 is a Kripke frame, and formula_10 is a relation between nodes of &quot;W&quot; and modal formulas, such that for all &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot; and modal formulas &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;:

* formula_11 if and only if formula_12,
* formula_13 if and only if formula_12 or formula_15,
* formula_16 if and only if formula_17 for all formula_18 such that formula_19.
We read formula_20 as “&quot;w&quot; satisfies
&quot;A&quot;”, “&quot;A&quot; is satisfied in &quot;w&quot;”, or
“&quot;w&quot; forces &quot;A&quot;”. The relation formula_10 is called the
&quot;satisfaction relation&quot;, &quot;evaluation&quot;, or &quot;forcing relation&quot;.
The satisfaction relation is uniquely determined by its
value on propositional variables.

A formula &quot;A&quot; is valid in:
* a model formula_8, if formula_20 for all &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;,
* a frame formula_7, if it is valid in formula_8 for all possible choices of formula_10,
* a class &quot;C&quot; of frames or models, if it is valid in every member of &quot;C&quot;.
We define Thm(&quot;C&quot;) to be the set of all formulas that are valid in
&quot;C&quot;. Conversely, if &quot;X&quot; is a set of formulas, let Mod(&quot;X&quot;) be the
class of all frames which validate every formula from &quot;X&quot;.

A modal logic (i.e., a set of formulas) &quot;L&quot; is sound with
respect to a class of frames &quot;C&quot;, if &quot;L&quot; ⊆ Thm(&quot;C&quot;). &quot;L&quot; is
complete wrt &quot;C&quot; if &quot;L&quot; ⊇ Thm(&quot;C&quot;).

=== Correspondence and completeness ===
Semantics is useful for investigating a logic (i.e. a derivation system) only if the semantic consequence relation reflects its syntactical counterpart, the &quot;syntactic consequence&quot; relation (&quot;derivability&quot;). It is vital to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and to determine also which class that is.

For any class &quot;C&quot; of Kripke frames, Thm(&quot;C&quot;) is a normal modal logic (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, &quot;K&quot;, are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold in general: while most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions, 
Kripke incomplete normal modal logics do exist. A natural example of such a system is Japaridze&#x27;s polymodal logic.

A normal modal logic &quot;L&quot; corresponds to a class of frames &quot;C&quot;, if &quot;C&quot; = Mod(&quot;L&quot;). In other words, &quot;C&quot; is the largest class of frames such that &quot;L&quot; is sound wrt &quot;C&quot;. It follows that &quot;L&quot; is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class.

Consider the schema T : formula_27.
T is valid in any reflexive frame formula_7: if
formula_29, then formula_20
since &quot;w&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;w&quot;. On the other hand, a frame which
validates T has to be reflexive: fix &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;, and
define satisfaction of a propositional variable &quot;p&quot; as follows:
formula_31 if and only if &quot;w&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;u&quot;. Then
formula_32, thus formula_33
by T, which means &quot;w&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;w&quot; using the definition of
formula_10. T corresponds to the class of reflexive
Kripke frames.

It is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of &quot;L&quot; than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show &quot;incompleteness&quot; of modal logics: suppose &quot;L&quot;1 ⊆ &quot;L&quot;2 are normal modal logics that correspond to the same class of frames, but &quot;L&quot;1 does not prove all theorems of &quot;L&quot;2. Then &quot;L&quot;1 is Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema formula_35 generates an incomplete logic, as it
corresponds to the same class of frames as GL (viz. transitive and
converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the GL-tautology formula_36.

==== Common modal axiom schemata ====
The following table lists common modal axioms together with their corresponding classes. The naming of the axioms often varies; Here, axiom K is named after Saul Kripke; axiom T is named after the truth axiom in epistemic logic; axiom D is named after deontic logic; axiom B is named after L. E. J. Brouwer; and axioms 4 and 5 are named based on C. I. Lewis&#x27;s numbering of symbolic logic systems.
Axiom K can also be rewritten as formula_37, which logically establishes modus ponens as a rule of inference in every possible world.

Note that for axiom D, formula_38 implicitly implies formula_39, which means that for every possible world in the model, there is always at least one possible world accessible from it (which could be itself). This implicit implication formula_40 is similar to the implicit implication by existential quantifier on the range of quantification.

==== Common modal systems ====
===Canonical models===

For any normal modal logic, &quot;L&quot;, a Kripke model (called the canonical model) can be constructed that refutes precisely the non-theorems of
&quot;L&quot;, by an adaptation of the standard technique of using maximal consistent sets as models. Canonical Kripke models play a 
role similar to the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra construction in algebraic
semantics.

A set of formulas is &quot;L&quot;-&quot;consistent&quot; if no contradiction can be derived from it using the theorems of &quot;L&quot;, and Modus Ponens. A &quot;maximal L-consistent set&quot; (an &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot;
for short) is an &quot;L&quot;-consistent set that has no proper &quot;L&quot;-consistent superset.

The canonical model of &quot;L&quot; is a Kripke model
formula_8, where &quot;W&quot; is the set of all &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot;,
and the relations &quot;R&quot; and formula_10 are as follows:
: formula_43 if and only if for every formula formula_44, if formula_45 then formula_46,
: formula_47 if and only if formula_48.
The canonical model is a model of &quot;L&quot;, as every &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot; contains
all theorems of &quot;L&quot;. By Zorn&#x27;s lemma, each &quot;L&quot;-consistent set
is contained in an &quot;L&quot;-&quot;MCS&quot;, in particular every formula
unprovable in &quot;L&quot; has a counterexample in the canonical model.

The main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of K immediately imply completeness of K with respect to the class of all Kripke frames.
This argument does &quot;not&quot; work for arbitrary &quot;L&quot;, because there is no guarantee that the underlying &quot;frame&quot; of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of &quot;L&quot;.

We say that a formula or a set &quot;X&quot; of formulas is canonical
with respect to a property &quot;P&quot; of Kripke frames, if
* &quot;X&quot; is valid in every frame that satisfies &quot;P&quot;,
* for any normal modal logic &quot;L&quot; that contains &quot;X&quot;, the underlying frame of the canonical model of &quot;L&quot; satisfies &quot;P&quot;.
A union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical.
It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by
a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and
compact.

The axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus
any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not
canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is
not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic S4.1 (in
fact, even K4.1) is canonical.

In general, it is undecidable whether a given axiom is
canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: Henrik Sahlqvist identified a broad class of formulas (now called
Sahlqvist formulas) such that
* a Sahlqvist formula is canonical,
* the class of frames corresponding to a Sahlqvist formula is first-order definable,
* there is an algorithm that computes the corresponding frame condition to a given Sahlqvist formula.
This is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms
listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas.

===Finite model property===

A logic has the finite model property (FMP) if it is complete
with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this
notion is the decidability question: it
follows from
Post&#x27;s theorem that a recursively axiomatized modal logic &quot;L&quot;
which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given
finite frame is a model of &quot;L&quot;. In particular, every finitely
axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable.

There are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic.
Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often
work, using tools such as filtration or
unravelling. As another possibility,
completeness proofs based on cut-free
sequent calculi usually produce finite models
directly.

Most of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed above) have FMP.

In some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic:
every normal modal logic is complete with respect to a class of
modal algebras, and a &quot;finite&quot; modal algebra can be transformed
into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method
that every normal extension of S4.3 has FMP, and is Kripke
complete.

===Multimodal logics===
Kripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with
more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with
formula_49 as the set of its necessity operators
consists of a non-empty set &quot;W&quot; equipped with binary relations
&quot;Ri&quot; for each &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;. The definition of a
satisfaction relation is modified as follows:

: formula_50 if and only if formula_51

A simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for
polymodal provability logics. A Carlson model is a structure
formula_52
with a single accessibility relation &quot;R&quot;, and subsets
&quot;Di&quot; ⊆ &quot;W&quot; for each modality. Satisfaction is
defined as

: formula_50 if and only if formula_54

Carlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual
polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal
logics which are Carlson incomplete.

==Semantics of intuitionistic logic==

Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic follows the same principles as the semantics of modal logic, but it uses a different definition of satisfaction.

An intuitionistic Kripke model is a triple
formula_55, where formula_56 is a preordered Kripke frame, and formula_10 satisfies the following conditions:
* if &quot;p&quot; is a propositional variable, formula_58, and formula_33, then formula_31 (&quot;persistency&quot; condition (cf. monotonicity)),
* formula_61 if and only if formula_20 and formula_15,
* formula_64 if and only if formula_20 or formula_15,
* formula_13 if and only if for all formula_68, formula_17 implies formula_70,
* not formula_71.

The negation of &quot;A&quot;, ¬&quot;A&quot;, could be defined as an abbreviation for &quot;A&quot; → ⊥. If for all &quot;u&quot; such that &quot;w&quot; ≤ &quot;u&quot;, not &quot;u&quot; ⊩ &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;w&quot; ⊩ &quot;A&quot; → ⊥ is vacuously true, so &quot;w&quot; ⊩ ¬&quot;A&quot;.

Intuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke
semantics, and it has the finite model property.

===Intuitionistic first-order logic===

Let &quot;L&quot; be a first-order language. A Kripke
model of &quot;L&quot; is a triple
formula_72, where
formula_56 is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, &quot;Mw&quot; is a
(classical) &quot;L&quot;-structure for each node &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;, and
the following compatibility conditions hold whenever &quot;u&quot; ≤ &quot;v&quot;:
* the domain of &quot;Mu&quot; is included in the domain of &quot;Mv&quot;,
* realizations of function symbols in &quot;Mu&quot; and &quot;Mv&quot; agree on elements of &quot;Mu&quot;,
* for each &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate &quot;P&quot; and elements &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;an&quot; ∈ &quot;Mu&quot;: if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;an&quot;) holds in &quot;Mu&quot;, then it holds in &quot;Mv&quot;.
Given an evaluation &quot;e&quot; of variables by elements of &quot;Mw&quot;, we
define the satisfaction relation formula_74:
* formula_75 if and only if formula_76 holds in &quot;Mw&quot;,
* formula_77 if and only if formula_74 and formula_79,
* formula_80 if and only if formula_74 or formula_79,
* formula_83 if and only if for all formula_68, formula_85 implies formula_86,
* not formula_87,
* formula_88 if and only if there exists an formula_89 such that formula_90,
* formula_91 if and only if for every formula_68 and every formula_93 , formula_94.
Here &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;→&quot;a&quot;) is the evaluation which gives &quot;x&quot; the
value &quot;a&quot;, and otherwise agrees with &quot;e&quot;.

===Kripke–Joyal semantics===

As part of the independent development of sheaf theory, it was realised around 1965 that Kripke semantics was intimately related to the treatment of existential quantification in topos theory. That is, the &#x27;local&#x27; aspect of existence for sections of a sheaf was a kind of logic of the &#x27;possible&#x27;. Though this development was the work of a number of people, the name Kripke–Joyal semantics is often used in this connection.

==Model constructions==

As in classical model theory, there are methods for
constructing a new Kripke model from other models.

The natural homomorphisms in Kripke semantics are called
p-morphisms (which is short for &quot;pseudo-epimorphism&quot;, but the
latter term is rarely used). A p-morphism of Kripke frames
formula_7 and formula_96 is a mapping
formula_97 such that
* &quot;f&quot; preserves the accessibility relation, i.e., &quot;u R v&quot; implies &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) &quot;R’&quot; &quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;),
* whenever &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) &quot;R’&quot; &quot;v&quot;’, there is a &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot; such that &quot;u R v&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) = &quot;v&quot;’.
A p-morphism of Kripke models formula_8 and
formula_99 is a p-morphism of their
underlying frames formula_97, which
satisfies
: formula_33 if and only if formula_102, for any propositional variable &quot;p&quot;.

P-morphisms are a special kind of bisimulations. In general, a
bisimulation between frames formula_7 and
formula_96 is a relation
&quot;B ⊆ W × W’&quot;, which satisfies
the following “zig-zag” property:
* if &quot;u B u’&quot; and &quot;u R v&quot;, there exists &quot;v’&quot; ∈ &quot;W’&quot; such that &quot;v B v’&quot; and &quot;u’ R’ v’&quot;,
* if &quot;u B u’&quot; and &quot;u’ R’ v’&quot;, there exists &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot; such that &quot;v B v’&quot; and &quot;u R v&quot;.
A bisimulation of models is additionally required to preserve forcing
of atomic formulas:
: if &quot;w B w’&quot;, then formula_33 if and only if formula_106, for any propositional variable &quot;p&quot;.
The key property which follows from this definition is that
bisimulations (hence also p-morphisms) of models preserve the
satisfaction of &quot;all&quot; formulas, not only propositional variables.

We can transform a Kripke model into a tree using
unravelling. Given a model formula_8 and a fixed
node &quot;w&quot;0 ∈ &quot;W&quot;, we define a model
formula_99, where &quot;W’&quot; is the
set of all finite sequences
formula_109 such
that &quot;wi R wi+1&quot; for all
&quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, and formula_110 if and only if
formula_111 for a propositional variable
&quot;p&quot;. The definition of the accessibility relation &quot;R’&quot;
varies; in the simplest case we put
:formula_112,
but many applications need the reflexive and/or transitive closure of
this relation, or similar modifications.

Filtration is a useful construction which one can use to prove FMP for many logics. Let &quot;X&quot; be a set of
formulas closed under taking subformulas. An &quot;X&quot;-filtration of a
model formula_8 is a mapping &quot;f&quot; from &quot;W&quot; to a model
formula_99 such that
* &quot;f&quot; is a surjection,
* &quot;f&quot; preserves the accessibility relation, and (in both directions) satisfaction of variables &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;,
* if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) &quot;R’&quot; &quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) and formula_115, where formula_45, then formula_117.
It follows that &quot;f&quot; preserves satisfaction of all formulas from
&quot;X&quot;. In typical applications, we take &quot;f&quot; as the projection
onto the quotient of &quot;W&quot; over the relation
: &quot;u ≡X v&quot; if and only if for all &quot;A&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, formula_17 if and only if formula_117.
As in the case of unravelling, the definition of the accessibility
relation on the quotient varies.

==General frame semantics==
The main defect of Kripke semantics is the existence of Kripke incomplete logics, and logics which are complete but not compact. It can be remedied by equipping Kripke frames with extra structure which restricts the set of possible valuations, using ideas from algebraic semantics. This gives rise to the general frame semantics.

==Computer science applications==

Blackburn et al. (2001) point out that because a relational structure is simply a set together with a collection of relations on that set, it is unsurprising that relational structures are to be found just about everywhere. As an example from theoretical computer science, they give labeled transition systems, which model program execution. Blackburn et al. thus claim because of this connection that modal languages are ideally suited in providing &quot;internal, local perspective on relational structures.&quot; (p. xii)

==History and terminology==

Similar work that predated Kripke&#x27;s revolutionary semantic breakthroughs:
* Rudolf Carnap seems to have been the first to have the idea that one can give a possible world semantics for the modalities of necessity and possibility by means of giving the valuation function a parameter that ranges over Leibnizian possible worlds. Bayart develops this idea further, but neither gave recursive definitions of satisfaction in the style introduced by Tarski;
* J.C.C. McKinsey and Alfred Tarski developed an approach to modeling modal logics that is still influential in modern research, namely the algebraic approach, in which Boolean algebras with operators are used as models. Bjarni Jónsson and Tarski established the representability of Boolean algebras with operators in terms of frames. If the two ideas had been put together, the result would have been precisely frame models, which is to say Kripke models, years before Kripke. But no one (not even Tarski) saw the connection at the time.
*Arthur Prior, building on unpublished work of C. A. Meredith, developed a translation of sentential modal logic into classical predicate logic that, if he had combined it with the usual model theory for the latter, would have produced a model theory equivalent to Kripke models for the former. But his approach was resolutely syntactic and anti-model-theoretic.
* Stig Kanger gave a rather more complex approach to the interpretation of modal logic, but one that contains many of the key ideas of Kripke&#x27;s approach. He first noted the relationship between conditions on accessibility relations and Lewis-style axioms for modal logic. Kanger failed, however, to give a completeness proof for his system;
* Jaakko Hintikka gave a semantics in his papers introducing epistemic logic that is a simple variation of Kripke&#x27;s semantics, equivalent to the characterisation of valuations by means of maximal consistent sets. He doesn&#x27;t give inference rules for epistemic logic, and so cannot give a completeness proof;
* Richard Montague had many of the key ideas contained in Kripke&#x27;s work, but he did not regard them as significant, because he had no completeness proof, and so did not publish until after Kripke&#x27;s papers had created a sensation in the logic community;
* Evert Willem Beth presented a semantics of intuitionistic logic based on trees, which closely resembles Kripke semantics, except for using a more cumbersome definition of satisfaction.

<doc id="911963" wikidata="Q2006725" url="?curid=911963" title="Triumph Acclaim">
<text>The Triumph Acclaim is a front-wheel drive compact family saloon/sedan manufactured by British Leyland (BL) from 1981 to 1984, as a locally built version of the Honda Ballade. It was the final vehicle marketed under the Triumph marque, and the first product of the alliance between BL (later the Rover Group) and Honda which would last until the mid 1990s.

The Acclaim was the first Japanese-designed car manufactured within the European Economic Community (now the European Union), to bypass Japan&#x27;s voluntary limit of 11 per cent market of the total number of European sales. It was a major turnaround point for BL itself, achieving both reliability and high build quality from the outset.

Assembled at the Pressed Steel Fisher Plant at Cowley, Oxford, the Acclaim paved the way for the Honda-based, Rover-badged range of cars which BL (and successor organisations Austin Rover and Rover Group) would develop throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

==Background==

The development process began in 1978, when British Leyland entered into negotiations with Honda to develop a new small family saloon. Although the Acclaim officially replaced the Triumph Dolomite, BL&#x27;s mainstream products in the segment were the Austin Allegro and Austin Maxi - both of which were outdated and nearing the end of a long production run. The Acclaim was therefore originally intended as a short-term product until all-new products were ready for launch. On 26 December 1979, Michael Edwardes officially signed a collaboration between the two companies. The new car would be essentially be a licence-built version of the Honda Ballade (itself derived from the second generation Honda Civic), but with some modifications for the European market and locally sourced content. It replaced the Triumph Dolomite, which had finished production a year when the Canley plant in Coventry was closed down. The Acclaim was officially launched by BL on 7 October 1981. The Maxi had just been withdrawn from production at this stage, with Allegro production ending in March 1982.

The end of Dolomite and TR7 production meant that the Acclaim was the only car to wear the Triumph badge after 1981.

The Acclaim was a major turnaround point for BL itself, with the car achieving good reliability and build quality from the outset - a stark contrast to the quality-control issues which had plagued earlier models. The Acclaim held the record for the lowest percentage of warranty claims for a BL car. 

Unlike previous Triumphs, the Acclaim was assembled at the Pressed Steel Fisher Plant at Cowley, Oxford, taking over the withdrawn Austin Maxi production lines. It was briefly produced alongside the Morris Ital, a revamped version of the Marina. BL invested £80 million in new production facilities at Cowley, with a new press line and paint shop installed specifically for the Acclaim. Whilst major parts such as the powertrain, chassis components, dashboard assembly and much of the electrical systems were imported from Honda&#x27;s factories in Japan, the amount of British-sourced content within the Acclaim gradually increased over its production life.

==Design and mechanicals==
The most notable outward change from the Honda was the appearance of a central badge on the grille. At the time, the Japanese model had &quot;Honda&quot; to the right-hand side of the grille. Other changes included twin Keihin carburettors (the Ballade had only a single carburettor), the mirrors were situated on the doors, the independent front and rear MacPherson strut suspension was tweaked for the UK market and the seats were based on Morris Ital frames. The Acclaim was provided in a more luxurious interior trim than its Honda equivalent, even in its base models. The brakes were disc at the front and drum at the rear.

All Acclaims were powered by the transverse-mounted all alloy and overhead-cam engine found in the Honda Civic. This engine was a member of the Honda CVCC family, although the cast alloy rocker cover with Honda branding was replaced with a plain black pressed steel item for the Acclaim to disguise the car&#x27;s Honda origins. The engine drove the front wheels through either a five-speed manual gearbox or a three-speed Trio-matic (which was a manually selectable automatic transmission) gearbox (the same as the Hondamatic) and the interior was nearly identical (except for the seats). The usual BL trim levels were offered: L, HL, HLS and the top of the range CD, which had front and rear electric windows, chrome bumpers, headlamp washers, 165/70 tyres (the L had 145/80 tyres and the HL &amp; HLS had 155/80 tyres), plastic wheel trims, velour upholstery with seat pockets on the back of the front seats, front seat head restraints and optional air conditioning. The car remained largely the same throughout its production life. A Mark 2 version of the Acclaim came out in 1983 (from VI No. 180415 onwards). The main changes were to the exterior door handles, an electronic digital clock replaced the previous mechanical one, a restyled steering wheel, a restyled gear knob, the rear interior door handles (they were just swapped) and the heater recirculation control, which was moved. Mark 2 HL and HLS cars were better equipped than the earlier ones.

==Marketing and sales==
There was a limited-edition Avon Acclaim, getting its name from Avon coachbuilders of Warwick who did the conversion work, that had leather seats with piping to match the body colour, leather door panels, wooden and leather trimmed dashboard, wooden door cappings, two-tone metallic paint, colour-coded wheels with chrome embellishers, chrome-plated grille, colour-coded headlamp surrounds, vinyl roof and extra soundproofing. There was also an Avon Turbo, which had Lunar alloy wheels with 205/60 tyres, suede upholstery, front air dam, and side decals. A Turbo Technics turbocharger increased the engine&#x27;s power output from the standard 70 bhp to 105 bhp. It is thought that there are only four surviving Avon Turbos including the press car (VWK689X), which was the first Avon Turbo.

The Acclaim was Britain&#x27;s seventh best selling car in 1982 and the eighth best selling car in 1983.

The demise of the Acclaim came in June 1984 when the Rover 200 was launched, based on the next incarnation of the Honda Ballade. A total of 133,625 Acclaims were produced, the vast majority of which were sold in the UK. The last Acclaim off the production line (a silver CD with the Trio-matic) is now in the Heritage Motor Centre. The Acclaim&#x27;s demise saw the end of the Triumph marque as a car (although the name continues in motorcycles), as Austin Rover&#x27;s restructuring retained only the Austin, Rover and MG marques, and by 1989 even the Austin marque had been axed. Earlier in 1984, Austin Rover had confirmed that the Triumph brand would be discontinued when the Acclaim was replaced, and its successor would be badged as a Rover.

On Sunday 9 October 2011, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the launch of the Acclaim, 23 Acclaims were gathered at the Cowley works where the cars were built and the Heritage Motor Centre. This included the oldest known surviving Acclaim, the first Avon Turbo, the final production Acclaim and the only known nut-and-bolt restored Acclaim.

By mid 2020, 125 Triumph Acclaims were left on the road, with a further 258 registered as SORN.

<text>The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class battleships were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy (RN) at the end of the first decade of the 20th century, the last battleships built for the RN. The sister ships spent their whole careers assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as flagships. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, and the inconclusive action of 19 August several months later, their service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

The &quot;Colossus&quot; class were deemed obsolete by the end of the war in 1918 and were reduced to reserve the following year. &quot;Hercules&quot; was sold for scrap in 1921, although &quot;Colossus&quot; was briefly used as a training ship. She was hulked in 1923 and sold for scrap five years later.

==Background and design==
The initial 1909–1910 Naval Programme included two dreadnoughts and a battlecruiser, but was later increased to six dreadnoughts and two battlecruisers as a result of public pressure on the government due to the Anglo-German naval arms race. The original pair of battleships became the &quot;Colossus&quot; class and were improved versions of the preceding battleship, . On 19 November 1908, Rear-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, the Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, proposed the changes that he would like to make to the &quot;Neptune&quot;″s design. He wanted to redistribute the armour from locations not exposed to enemy fire to those that were and to fit 21-inch (533 mm) torpedoes in lieu of the 18-inch (450 mm) weapons used in the earlier ship; the number of spare torpedoes were to be increased as well. Likely prompted by an earlier memo from Admiral Francis Bridgeman, commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet, Jellicoe wanted to eliminate the mainmast and transfer most of the functions of its spotting top to an armoured spotting tower atop the conning tower in the superstructure. The Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO), Rear-Admiral Reginald Bacon, argued that the spotting top in the foremast should be retained. Jellicoe was willing to slightly increase the new design&#x27;s displacement over &quot;Neptune&quot;, but it could not cost any more, which placed major constraints on the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Philip Watts.
The DNC objected to the loss of the mainmast as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel&#x27;s six, further increasing the smoke from the forward funnel.
All eight capital ships of the 1909–1910 Naval Programme had the same arrangement of masts and funnels; only the two battlecruisers had their foremast and forward funnel positions exchanged at considerable expense. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: &quot;It is amazing that it took so long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the DNO&#x27;s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe&#x27;s obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships.&quot;

Like &quot;Neptune&quot;, the wing turrets of the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships were staggered &quot;en echelon&quot; so that all five turrets could shoot on the broadside, although in practice the blast damage to the superstructure and boats made this impractical except in an emergency. The design also perpetuated siting the ship&#x27;s boats on girders over the two wing turrets to reduce the length of the vessel. However, if the girders were damaged during combat, they could fall onto the turrets, immobilising them. The bridge and its associated compass platform was also situated above the conning tower, which similarly risked being obscured if the bridge collapsed.

==Description==
The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of () or () and a deep draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 751–778 officers and ratings upon completion and 791 in July 1916.

The ships were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines. The &quot;Colossus&quot; class were the first British dreadnoughts that had three engine rooms. The outer propeller shafts were coupled to the high-pressure turbines in the outer engine rooms and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines in the centre engine room which drove the inner shafts. The turbines used steam provided by eighteen water-tube boilers at a working pressure of . They were rated at and were intended to give the dreadnoughts a maximum speed of . During their sea trials, the sister ships handily exceeded their designed speed and horsepower. They carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===

The &quot;Colossus&quot; class was equipped with ten 50-calibre breech-loading (BL) Mark XI guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of two rounds per minute. The ships carried 100 shells per gun. Her wing turrets were staggered &quot;en echelon&quot; so all five turrets could shoot on the broadside, although in practice the blast damage to the superstructure and boats made this impractical except in an emergency. 

Their secondary armament consisted of sixteen 50-calibre BL four-inch (102 mm) Mark VII guns. These guns were installed in unshielded single mounts in the superstructure. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 18 torpedoes were provided.

The &quot;Colossus&quot; class had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and rear barbettes that reduced to outside the central armoured citadel, but did not reach the bow or stern. This made them the first British battleships since 1893 not to have a complete belt of armour at the waterline. The belt covered the side of the hull from above the waterline to below where it thinned to at its bottom edge. Above this was a strake of 8-inch armour. The forward oblique bulkheads connected the waterline and upper armour belts to the &#x27;A&#x27; barbette. Similarly the aft bulkhead connected the armour belts to &#x27;Y&#x27; barbette, although it was 8 inches thick. The exposed faces of the three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck and thinned to 4 or below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 11 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had 11-inch faces and sides with 3-inch roofs.

The three armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greater thicknesses outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the roof was 3 inches thick. The spotting tower behind and above the conning tower had sides and the torpedo-control tower aft had 3-inch sides and a 2-inch roof. In the interests of saving weight, the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships eliminated the anti-torpedo bulkheads that protected the engine and boiler rooms, reverting to the scheme in the older dreadnoughts that placed them only outboard of the magazines with the same thickness from . They did retain the 1-inch armour plates protecting the boiler uptakes.

===Fire control===

The control position for the main armament were located in the spotting tops at the head of the foremast. Data from a Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder located there was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination. By 1912, another nine-foot rangefinder was added at the forward side of the compass platform. In late 1914, more nine-foot rangefinders, protected by armoured hoods, were installed on the turret roofs.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years between the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships&#x27; commissioning and the start of World War I, and the most important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, both ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.

Another development was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. &quot;Hercules&quot; was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. &quot;Colossus&quot; received her Mark I table by early 1916.

===Modifications===

In 1913–1914, a small rangefinder was added to the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret and gun shields were fitted to the 4-inch guns in the forward superstructure in &quot;Hercules&quot;. After the start of the war in August 1914, a pair of 3-inch anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. The sisters received fire-control directors by December 1915; &quot;Colossus&quot; mounted hers on a platform below the spotting top and &quot;Hercules&quot; had hers installed on a rear extension of the compass platform. Approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, four 4-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure. By April 1917, the ships were equipped with single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns and the forward group of 4-inch guns had been enclosed in casemates. The stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 and a high-angle rangefinder was fitted on the spotting top in 1918. &quot;Hercules&quot; had no further alterations made before her sale, but &quot;Colossus&quot; had her AA guns removed in 1919–1920 and some 4-inch guns were removed during her September–October 1921 refit. In addition, some machinery was removed during the refit to demilitarise the ship in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Careers==
Upon commissioning, both ships were assigned to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet and &quot;Hercules&quot; became the flagship of the division. The 2nd Division was renamed the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The sisters participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. Around the end of the year, &quot;Colossus&quot; was transferred to the 1st BS. &quot;Hercules&quot; became a private ship in early 1913 and joined her sister in the 1st BS two months later.
Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the sisters took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans&#x27; reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. In November 1915, &quot;Colossus&quot; became the flagship of the 5th Division of the 1st BS.

===Battle of Jutland===

In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers which were to act as bait. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, so the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

Once Jellicoe&#x27;s ships had rendezvoused with the 2nd BS, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, on the morning of 31 May, he organised the main body of the Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd BS were on his left (east), the 4th BS was in the centre and the 1st BS on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 4th and 1st Battle Squadrons in the center and rear of the line of battle, respectively, which meant that the sisters were at the rear of the Grand Fleet once it finished deploying. Both ships fired at the crippled light cruiser with unknown results. They also engaged and hit the battlecruisers and multiple times, although only inflicting light damage. In return, &quot;Seydlitz&quot; hit &quot;Colossus&quot; twice, with only minor effect, but she was the only battleship in the main body of the Grand Fleet to be hit by gunfire during the battle. They also fired at German destroyers, but failed to make any hits. Neither of the sisters fired more than 98 rounds from their main guns during the battle.

===Subsequent activity===

After the battle, the sisters were transferred to the 4th BS; &quot;Hercules&quot; became the flagship of the commander, while &quot;Colossus&quot; became the flagship of the squadron&#x27;s second-in-command. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August 1916 to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, they sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British to be caught, and no shots were fired. The sisters were present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered there on 21 November.

On 3 December, &quot;Hercules&quot; was detached to take the Allied Naval Armistice Commission to Kiel, Germany, returning to Rosyth on 20 December. &quot;Colossus&quot; briefly became flagship of the Reserve Fleet in 1919 and &quot;Hercules&quot; joined her in the reserves a month later. The sisters were listed for disposal in 1921 and &quot;Hercules&quot; was sold later in the year and broken up in 1922. &quot;Colossus&quot;, however, was reprieved to serve as a boys&#x27; training ship, and refitted to suit her new role. It did not last long as the school closed in 1922 and she was again listed for disposal. &quot;Colossus&quot; was withdrawn from the disposal list in 1923 and hulked for the use of the training establishment . The ship withdrawn from that duty in 1927 and sold for scrap the following year.

<text>The Triumph TR8 is a sports car built by the British Triumph Motor Company from 1978 until 1981. It is an eight-cylinder version of the &quot;wedge-shaped&quot; Triumph TR7 which was designed by Harris Mann and manufactured by British Leyland (BL), through its Jaguar/Rover/Triumph (JRT) division. The majority of TR8s were sold in the United States and Canada.

==Background==
A more powerful V8-engined version of the TR7 was planned in the early stages of the TR7&#x27;s development, a prototype being produced in 1972. However, British Leyland&#x27;s financial state, labour problems and lack of engines—as MG and Range Rover had first priority—delayed the project. By 1978 some 145 prototype cars were built with V8 engines (and usually automatic transmissions). These &quot;anonymous&quot; TR8s (no identifying badges, and all coupes) were evaluated for British Leyland by various dealers and then sold off as used cars.

The FIA papers for the TR8 homologation, granted 1 April 1978, include pictures showing a 1977 TR7 V8 prototype with a set of decals indicating it to be a TR7 V8. However, oddly, these TR8 homologation pictures also show it had the large &quot;Sprint&quot; decals on the rear wings, in the same font as the TR7 and V8 decals on the boot lid. It is not clear from the picture of the front of the car whether or not it had a small Sprint decal below the TR7 decal, as is shown on the TR8 prototype in Hardcastle’s book on the Rover V8 engine. Neither of these decals are part of the set used on the car shown in the TR7 Sprint homologation pictures in the BMIHT archives, and in Knowles’ &quot;Triumph TR7 The Untold Story&quot;. And, unlike that decal set, the Sprint decals shown on this TR8 and that in Hardcastle are not known by any BL part numbers. The official use of these pictures in the homologation process may suggest that BL toyed with the idea of calling this car the &quot;TR7 V8 Sprint&quot; or &quot;TR7 Sprint V8&quot;, etc., at some point, but did not progress the idea beyond when these photographs were taken.

==Description==
The TR8 did not use Triumph&#x27;s own single overhead cam V8 as found in the Stag due to its weight and service record but instead shared its Rover V8 engine with the Rover SD1. The engine itself was derived from an early 1960s Buick/Oldsmobile all-aluminium V8 that Rover acquired from General Motors in the mid-60s.

History has shown this engine to be a reliable, flexible, and robust powerplant, especially after BL improved its manufacturing process. TR8s were initially fitted with twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetors. However, about 400 1980 models sold in California, all 1981 models—of which only 352 were produced including twenty carbed cars for the UK market---and all 1982 models (of which all seventy went to Canada) featured a Bosch L-jetronic fuel injection system with a specially designed Lucas fuel injection computer (ECU). The 1980 carburetor model was rated at (at 5000 rpm) and the fuel injected California version at at the same engine speed. For 1981, all North American cars received a unified version with fuel injection, producing at 5100 rpm and delivering 0–60 mph times in the low 8 seconds. Other differences between the TR8 and TR7 are upgraded brakes, revised axle ratio (3.08:1 on the TR8 and all automatic TR7s), battery moved to the trunk (boot), alloy wheels, leather steering wheel and a few minor trim changes.

== Production ==
TR8 coupes based on the original Harris Mann TR7 design made from 1978 to 1980 are quite rare; it is estimated that only about 400 TR8 coupes ever existed—this number from records kept by members of the North America-based wedge club, the Triumph Wedge Owners Association. To the roughly 150 pre-production coupes mentioned above, another 250 or so coupes were produced, some sold in Canada as 1979 models but most ended up being held back and then finally sold in the US as 1980 models. In 1979, a long-anticipated Michelotti-refreshed TR7 Drophead (convertible) was introduced, and almost all subsequent production TR8s were convertibles. &quot;Total&quot; worldwide production, as best as can be determined throughout all the labour turmoil at the time, is only around 2750, give or take a &quot;handful&quot;. (Enthusiast Richard Connew went through the records at British Motor Heritage Industry Trust and counted 2746.) Other estimates exist. The German version of this page claims 2722 and cites the TR Register-Austria as source; 2815 is the number quoted in an article from &quot;Classic &amp; Sports Car&quot;, March 1986 and in William Kimberley&#x27;s 1981 book as well. The TR8 was due to be launched in the UK and a pilot production run was made consisting of four prototypes and 18 pre-production cars. At this point British Leyland unexpectedly cancelled the project. The pre-production cars were subsequently sold via the dealer network to the general public and are highly collectable. Both the TR7 and TR8 were made until October 1981 when production ceased.

Very few genuine TR8s exist outside of the United States and Canada. In other countries the TR7 is often converted to a &quot;TR7V8&quot; with the same ubiquitous Buick/Rover 3.5 litre V8 powerplant used in original factory TR8s. In Australia a popular TR7V8 conversion is to use the 4416 cc version of this engine that had been developed for the Leyland P76.

In North America, the TR8 originally sold for around $11,000. A current rough estimate of the number of these cars remaining taken from the Triumph Wedge Owners Association registry of unique VINs, current Triumph Wedge Owners Association membership records, the World Wide TR7 TR8 Owners Club, and the TR Drivers Club UK is around 1000 convertibles and 200 coupes.

As of Q1 2011 there were approximately seventeen licensed and 33 SORN TR8s registered with the DVLA. The accuracy of this data is questionable as many converted TR7s with a V8 have been registered with DVLA as TR8s. Out of these fifty cars, only two are automatic, but more are known to exist.

== Motorsport ==
Despite their low production numbers, TR8s have an interesting racing history. John Buffum successfully raced one as a rally car in the late 1970s. Bob Tullius of Group 44 fame dominated SCCA racing in 1979 in one, so much so that the SCCA added enough &quot;reward&quot; weight to the car that Tullius left Trans Am and successfully competed in IMSA GT instead. TR8s ran successfully in the SCCA&#x27;s showroom stock series being campaigned by Morey Doyle ( Nationals &amp; Regionals) and Ted Schumacher (Nationals). Schumacher with Doyle had great success in the Playboy/Escort Endurance series with his car. Starting the last race of the year, Schumacher was fourth in the overall point standings (just three points away from first) when an accident ruined their chances; nevertheless, Schumacher still ended up seventh in the manufacturer&#x27;s points for that year, all with no official factory help. Presently, at least three cars are being run in SCCA&#x27;s ITS class. Morey Doyle and his son Andy run their TR8s in the Midwest Region, currently Morey and his sons, Morey C. and Andy are preparing the car for the SCCA National Runoffs in E-Prod at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (2017). Jeff Young runs his green TR8 in the Southeast Division with numerous regional race wins and the 2011 Southeast Division SARRC ITS championship, running against over seventy other drivers in Mazda RX7s, Miatas, 240/260/280Zs, BMW 325is, Porsche 944s and Acura Integras.

The TR8 was homologated for Group 4 (racing) on the first of April 1978. According to the FIA rules that applied at this time, recognition would have required the production of 400 similar cars suitable for normal sale. However, production records (in the BMIHT archives) show that only about 150 cars had actually been built by this time, mostly due to major industrial action at the BL Speke plant that included a 17-week-long strike from November 1977. Rally journalist and historian Graham Robson quotes John Davenport (director of BL Motorsport at the time) as reminding him that &quot;In those days there was no rigorous FIA inspection system. Provided that one provided production sheets signed by an important manager, then nobody worried...&quot; Robson goes on to state that &quot;A lot of fast and persuasive talking then went on, to show that the makings of well over 500 [sic] cars were either built, partly built, or stuck in the morass of the Speke strike&quot;. However, the FIA rules are clear that only &quot;entirely finished cars&quot; might be counted towards this requirement.

An alternative explanation that does not ignore the FIA&#x27;s explicit requirement for finished cars comes from an article on the Group-4 Vauxhall Chevette HS, published in Autosport only a few weeks after the TR8 was approved. That says &quot;there had arisen an understanding that some leeway was allowed. For instance, if the 400 cars were built within a few months of the homologation date then the car would normally be allowed through.&quot; And while the homologation of the Chevette HS was approved on 1 Nov. 1976, the 400 Chevette HSs weren&#x27;t finished till the end of 1977. Production records show that about another 250 fixed head coupe TR8s were built in 1978, making up the FIA requirement for 400. While the fixed head version of the TR8 does not appear to have ever been a catalogued model, only the convertible, and &quot;[f]ollowing the cancellation of the project, normal practice might have been to dismantle the cars or convert them to normal TR7 power&quot;, most or all were sold to private buyers in the US or Canada. This may be as a result of the FIA requirement for such homologation specials to be &quot;meant for the normal sale&quot;.

The TR8 did not go on sale in North America until mid-1979, and then only as a convertible model. According to Graham Robson, the Group 4 rally car was therefore called the TR7V8 as a compromise with BL Sales and Marketing.

<text>The digerati (or digirati) are the elite of digitalization, social media, content marketing, computer industry and online communities. The word is a portmanteau, derived from &quot;digital&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and reminiscent of the earlier coinage &quot;glitterati&quot; (glitter and literati). Famous computer scientists, tech magazine writers, digital consultants with multi-year experiences and well-known bloggers are included among the digerati.

The word is used in several related but different ways. It can mean:

*Opinion leaders who, through their writings, promoted a vision of digital technology and the Internet as a transformational element in society;
*People regarded as celebrities within the Silicon Valley computer subculture, particularly during the dot-com boom years;
*Anyone regarded as influential within the digital technology community.

==Term history==

The first mention of the word &quot;Digerati&quot; on USENET occurred in 1992 by Arthur Wang, and referred to an article by George Gilder in &quot;Upside&quot; magazine. According to the March 1, 1992 &quot;On Language&quot; column by William Safire in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, the term was coined by &quot;The New York Times&quot; editor Tim Race in a January 1992 &quot;New York Times&quot; article. In Race&#x27;s words:

:&quot;Actually the first use of &quot;digerati&quot; was in a January 29, 1992 New York Times article, &quot;Pools of Memory, Waves of Dispute&quot;, by John Markoff, into which I edited the term. The article was about a controversy engendered by a George Gilder article that had recently appeared in Upside magazine. In a March 1, 1992 &quot;On Language&quot; column in The New York Times Magazine, William Safire noted the coinage and gave me the honor of defining it, which we did like so:&quot;
::&quot;Digerati, n.pl. – people highly skilled in the processing and manipulation of digital information; wealthy or scholarly techno-geeks.&quot;

<doc id="912004" wikidata="Q17065416" url="?curid=912004" title="Farewell to Nova Scotia">
<text>&quot;Farewell to Nova Scotia&quot; is a popular folk song from Nova Scotia, Canada. It was adapted from the Scottish lament &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Adieu&quot; written by Robert Tannahill. It was written sometime before or during World War I and popularized in 1964 when Catherine McKinnon used it as the theme song for the Halifax-based CBC TV program, &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;.

Catalogued as Roud Folk Song Index No. 384, both the tune and lyrics are public domain.

== History ==
The 1791 Scottish folk song &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Adieu&quot; was printed in 1803 in a Glasgow newspaper and attributed to Robert Tannahill. Philip A. Ramsay&#x27;s 1838 edition of &quot;The Works of Robert Tannahill. With Life of the Author&quot; printed the first stanza of the song. Then Alexander Whitelaw published it in the 1843 edition of The Book of Scottish Song. David Semple then published it in his 1874 edition of &quot;The Poems and Songs of Robert Tannahill&quot;.

Folklorist Helen Creighton first collected the song in 1933 from Annie (Bayers) Greenough in West Petpeswick, Nova Scotia.

A version of &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Adieu&quot; was also recorded in the 1940s in Quebec titled, &quot;On the Banks of Jeddore&quot;.

The Quebec duo &quot;Les Karrik&quot; recorded a French version titled &quot;La Chanson de l&#x27;Acadien&quot; in 1971.

==Renditions==
The song has been covered, notably, by Tommy Makem, Gordon Lightfoot, Stan Rogers, The Irish Rovers, Ryan&#x27;s Fancy, Harry Hibbs, Paddy Reilly, Ian and Sylvia Tyson, Anne Murray, Touchstone, Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors, The Real McKenzies, Schooner Fare, Wicked Tinkers, Battlefield Band, Alex Beaton, Aselin Debison, Dan Zanes, Moist, Oisin, Sons of Maxwell, Na h-Òganaich, and Asonance. It is an ambient theme for the Canadian civilization in the game Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI: Gathering Storm.

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;
Chorus:
&quot;Farewell to Nova Scotia, the sea-bound coast,
&quot;let your mountains dark and dreary be.
&quot;for when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed,
&quot;Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?

1.
The sun was setting in the west,
The birds were singing on every tree.
All nature seemed inclined to rest
But still there was no rest for me.
&quot;Chorus&quot;

2.
I grieve to leave my native land,
I grieve to leave my comrades all,
And my aging parents whom I&#x27;ve always loved so dear,
And the bonnie, bonnie lass that I do adore.
&quot;Chorus&quot;

3.
The drums they do beat and the wars do alarm,
The captain calls, I must obey.
Farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia&#x27;s charms,
For it&#x27;s early in the morning and I&#x27;m far, far away.
&quot;Chorus&quot;

4.
I have three brothers and they are at rest,
Their arms are folded on their chest.
But a poor simple sailor just like me,
Must be tossed and turned in the deep dark sea.
&quot;Chorus&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Dartmoor Pony is a breed of pony that lives in Devon, England. The breed has been in England for centuries and is used in a variety of roles. Because of the extreme weather conditions experienced on the moors, the Dartmoor Pony is a particularly hardy breed with excellent stamina. Over the centuries, it has been used as a working animal by local tin miners and quarry workers. It is kept in a semiferal state on Dartmoor.

Despite this, numbers living on the open moor have declined from an estimated 5,000 in 1900 to about 300 registered ponies today. Only around 800 ponies were known to be grazing the moor in the spring of 2004.

==Breed characteristics==
The Dartmoor Pony has a small, neat head, large, wide-set eyes, and alert ears. It has a well-compact body that is strong, with a broad, deep rib cage, of medium length. The legs are strong, long from body to knee and hock, but with short cannons with strong, dense bone, and a flat-fronted knee; the fore leg rises to a shoulder that is well-angled and with good freedom of movement, and the hind leg rises to a quarter that is well-muscled and rounded in appearance, rather than flat or sloping. The mane and tail are full and flowing, and the pony&#x27;s movement is free and smooth. It has a kind temperament, being reliable, gentle, and calm. Most Dartmoors stand between ; a pony should stand at no more than 13 hands under the breed standard, introduced in 1924. Recognised colours include bay, brown, black, grey, chestnut, or roan.

Piebald and skewbald colouring is not permitted within the Dartmoor Pony breed. Ponies with this colouring, seen running on Dartmoor, are likely to be Dartmoor Hill Ponies, as Dartmoor commoners may graze any type of pony out on the moors. The Dartmoor Hill Pony is classified as a pony born on Dartmoor, but not a purebred registered Dartmoor Pony. It is not a true breed as such, as the registry for Dartmoor Hill Ponies is open only to those born on the moors, so a pony born of two Dartmoor Hill ponies, but not born on the moors, could not be registered with the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association.

Although Exmoor Ponies live fairly close geographically and their markings are somewhat similar, evidence now suggests that Dartmoor and Exmoor Ponies are not as related as was once thought.

==History==
The bones of prehistoric horses have been found in chamber tombs dating from Vere Gordon Childe&#x27;s period III - IV in southern Britain. This would date the bones at the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to an agricultural society (the Neolithic Revolution) around 3500 BC; the bones are probably from wild horses, but domestication may have begun by that date. Archeological investigation from the 1970s has shown that domesticated ponies were to be found on Dartmoor as early as 1500 BC. The first written record, dated to AD 1012, refers to wild horses at Ashburton, and early records from Dartmoor manors refer to ponies being branded and earmarked.
The Dartmoor Pony was used in medieval times for carrying heavy loads of tin ore from the mines across the moor. When the mines closed, some ponies were kept for farming, but most were turned out onto the moor. Ponies were bred at Dartmoor Prison from the early 1900s until the 1960s, and used by guards for escorting prisoners.

The Dartmoor received Arab blood from the stallion Dwarka, foaled in 1922, as well as Dwarka&#x27;s son, The Leat. Welsh Pony breeding was introduced from the stallion Dinarth Spark, and infusions of Fell Pony blood were also added.

The first attempt to define and register the breed was in 1898, when the ponies were entered into a studbook started by the Polo Pony Society. In 1924, the breed society was founded, and a studbook opened. World War I and World War II were devastating to the breed. Only a few ponies were registered during World War II. However, after the war, local people began to inspect and register as many ponies as they could, and by the 1950s, numbers were back up.

Two schemes have been introduced to halt the decline in numbers, and broaden the gene pool of the Dartmoor Pony. The Dartmoor Pony Moorland Scheme was established in 1988 and is administered by the Dartmoor Pony Society and the Duchy of Cornwall, as well as being supported by the Dartmoor National Park. In 2004, a new scheme, the Dartmoor Pony Preservation Scheme, was introduced, and herds taking part in this new scheme must enter one mare each year to the DPMS. The Dartmoor Pony has been granted Rare Breed status.

==Dartmoor Ponies today==

Dartmoor Ponies are native to Britain, but are also seen in other parts of the world, including the US, Continental Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. They are often used as foundation breeding stock for the Riding Pony. The breed is a good size and temperament for a children&#x27;s mount, but it can carry an adult. They are mainly used for hunting, trail riding, showing, jumping, dressage, and driving, as well as everyday riding.

All ponies that are free-roaming on Dartmoor are owned and protected by Dartmoor Commoners. Visitors feeding the ponies is illegal.

<doc id="912019" wikidata="Q4950238" url="?curid=912019" title="Bourne End, Hertfordshire">
<text>Bourne End is a village in Hertfordshire, England. It is situated on the ancient Roman Akeman Street between Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead, on the former A41 London-Liverpool Trunk Route, on the Grand Union Canal that runs between London and Birmingham and at the confluence of the Chiltern chalk stream, the Bourne Gutter and the River Bulbourne. It is in the Dacorum Ward of Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield.

==History==
Bourne End formerly lay within the extended parish of Northchurch (Berkhamsted St. Mary). It was then known as the hamlet of Broadway. In 1909 the south-eastern part of Northchurch was separated into a new parish consisting of the hamlets of Sunnyside and Broadway. Bourne End/Broadway became a separate parish in 1915.

Bourne End derives its name as it lies at the end of the Bourne Gutter, an irregularly flowing stream, at its confluence with the River Bulbourne. According to local tradition the Bourne Gutter is a Woe Water that only flows at times of tragedy. Recorded instances include during 1665 at the time of the Great Plague, in 1914 at the outbreak of the World War I and in 1956 during the Suez Crisis. The Hemel Hempstead Gazette has also run stories on the Gutter flowing in early 1982 as Argentinian Forces invaded the Falkland Islands, in early October 1987 days before the Great Storm of 1987 that devastated woodlands throughout southern England, and in 2003 as British troops joined the International invasion of Iraq. It also began flowing in March 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic within the UK, and throughout Winter 2020 into Spring 2021.

Bourne End was the scene of the rail disaster on the West Coast Main Line on 30 September 1945 when an express train was derailed with many fatalities.

==Church of Saint John the Evangelist ==

In the 1850s the rector Cannon Sir John Hobart Culme Seymour decided to found a chapel of ease for St Mary&#x27;s Northchurch. The architect George Gilbert Scott was commissioned to design the new church and construction was funded by Thomas Halsey of The Hall, Berkhamsted. An additional donation was made by the Prince of Wales on behalf of the landowner, the Duchy of Cornwall. 

The Church of St. John The Evangelist was completed in 1854. It is a small flint church in the Gothic Revival style with a steep pitched roofs and decorative red tiles topped with a small wooden spire, a timber-framed porch and a semicircular apse at the east end. The six stained glass windows in the apse are early works by Alfred Bell. In 1889-1891 the chancel was altered to add a richly carved altar and a Gothic reredos depicting the Resurrection, and the domed apse ceiling was decorated with a painted scene of Dante&#x27;s vision of Heaven, painted by David Bell. In 2001 four of the Alfred Bell stained glass windows were stolen. These have since been replaced by replica windows, installed in 2003.

<doc id="912025" wikidata="Q875600" url="?curid=912025" title="Crossover (automobile)">
<text>A crossover, crossover SUV, or crossover utility vehicle (CUV) is a type of automobile with an increased ride height that is built on unibody chassis construction shared with passenger cars, as opposed to traditional sport utility vehicles (SUVs), which are built on a body-on-frame chassis construction similar to pickup trucks.

A term that originated from North America, the term crossover was initially used for any vehicle that blends characteristics between two different kinds of vehicles while, over time, crossover mostly refers to unibody-based SUVs. Crossovers are also described as &quot;car-like SUVs&quot; or &quot;car-based SUVs&quot;. The term SUV is often used as an umbrella term for both crossovers and traditional SUVs due to the similarities between them.

Compared to traditional SUVs, crossovers are known to be less capable of use in off-road conditions or hauling heavy loads, while instead offering other advantages such as superior fuel economy and handling. Compared to traditional cars with lower ride height and a lower roof such as sedans and hatchbacks, crossovers offer larger cabin space and enhanced driving position.

The 1977 Lada Niva is the world&#x27;s first mass-produced unibody off-road vehicle and has been credited as a forerunner of crossovers before that term was used, with the &#x27;79 AMC Eagle, being the first US example. The Toyota RAV4, first introduced in 1994, pioneered the modern concept of a crossover.

In the US, the market share of crossovers has grown from under 4% in 2000 to nearly 40% in 2018.

== Definition ==
The difference between crossover SUVs and other SUVs as generally defined by journalists and manufacturers is that a crossover is built using a unibody platform, while an SUV is built using a body-on-frame platform. However, these definitions are often blurred in practice, since unibody vehicles are also often referred to as SUVs. &quot;Crossover&quot; is a relatively recent term, and early unibody SUVs (such as the 1984 Jeep Cherokee) are rarely called crossovers. Due to these inconsistencies, the term &quot;SUV&quot; is often used as an umbrella term for both crossovers and traditional SUVs.

U.S. magazine &quot;MotorTrend&quot; in 2005 mentioned that the term &quot;crossover&quot; has become &quot;blurred as manufacturers apply it to everything from the Chrysler Pacifica to the Ford Five Hundred sedan&quot;. At that time, the publication proposes that the term &quot;soft-roader&quot; is more appropriate.

Some regions outside North America do not have a distinction between a crossover SUV and body-on-frame SUV, calling both of them SUVs. Several government bodies in the United States also did not acknowledge the crossover distinction, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In some jurisdictions, crossovers are classified as light trucks as are traditional SUVs and pickup trucks.

Outside the United States, the term &quot;crossover&quot; tends to be used for C-segment (compact) or smaller vehicles, with large unibody vehicles—such as the Audi Q7, Range Rover, Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg—usually referred to as SUVs rather than crossovers. In the United Kingdom, a crossover is sometimes defined as a hatchback with raised ride height and SUV-like styling features. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; noted the number of &quot;soft-roader&quot; cars on sale in 2019.

== Characteristics ==
Crossovers&#x27; driving characteristics and performance are similar to those of traditional passenger cars while providing more passenger and cargo space with relatively minor trade-offs in fuel economy and running costs. According to &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, the three top-selling crossovers in the US in 2018 (Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, and Nissan Rogue) return an average of 10% less fuel economy than the top three selling sedan equivalents in the mid-size segment (Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima), but provide almost 1.5 times the cargo space. Furthermore, the average mid-size crossover in the US costs less than 5% more than the average mid-size car.

Compared to truck-based SUVs, crossovers typically have greater interior comfort, a more comfortable ride, better fuel economy, and lower manufacturing costs, but inferior off-road and towing capabilities. Many crossovers lack an all-wheel drive or four-wheel-drive train, which, in combination with their inferior off-road capability, causes many journalists and consumers to question their definition as &quot;sports utility vehicles&quot;. This has led some to describe crossovers as pseudo-SUVs.

== History ==


Introduced in 1979, prior to the terms &quot;SUV&quot; or &quot;crossover&quot; being coined, the AMC Eagle is retroactively considered to be the first dedicated crossover automobile. The mass-market Eagle model line was based on a unibody passenger car platform, with fully-automatic four-wheel drive and a raised ride height. Furthermore, a writer for &quot;Motor Trend&quot; characterized the 1963 Studebaker Wagonaire as the &quot;first crossover&quot; because the innovative station wagon with a sliding roof &quot;mashed up various vehicle types.&quot; It was available only with a conventional rear-wheel drive.

Others cite the front-wheel drive 1977 Matra Rancho as a slightly earlier forerunner to the modern crossover. Marketed as a &quot;lifestyle&quot; vehicle, it was not available with four-wheel drive. In 1981, American Motors Corporation (AMC) introduced four-wheel drive subcompact models built on the two-door AMC Spirit, the &quot;Eagle SX/4&quot; and &quot;Eagle Kammback.&quot; These low-priced models joined the compact AMC Eagle line and they foreshadowed the market segment of comfortable cars with utility and foul-weather capabilities.

The first-generation Toyota RAV4, released in 1994, has been credited as the model that expanded the concept of a modern crossover. The RAV4 was based on a modified platform used by the Toyota Corolla and Toyota Carina. At its release, Toyota in Japan used the term &quot;4x4 vehicle&quot; to describe the model, while Toyota in the US called the vehicle a &quot;new concept SUV&quot;. By the early 2000s, Toyota was leading the market in its development of car-based trucks in North America with the release of other crossover models such as the Highlander and the Lexus RX. 

In North America, crossovers increased in popularity during the 2000s, when fuel efficiency standards for light trucks, which had been stuck at since 1996, moved upwards by 2005. With increasing fuel prices, traditional SUVs began to lose market share to crossovers. In the United States , crossover models comprised more than 50% of the overall SUV market. Crossovers have become increasingly popular in Europe also since the early 2010s.

In the first quarter of 2023 the Tesla Model Y crossover became the best-selling vehicle in the world.

== Size categories ==
Depending on the market, crossovers are divided into several size categories. Since there is an absence of any official distinction, often the size category is ambiguous for some crossover models. Several aspects needed to determine the size category of a vehicle may include length and width, positioning in its respective brand line-up, platform, and interior space.

=== Crossover city car (A-segment) ===

Crossover city cars (also called A-SUVs, city SUVs, city crossovers, or A-segment SUVs) are crossovers that generally ride on the platform of a city car (A-segment).

Crossover city car is a newly introduced automotive vehicle segment, with the first vehicle in the segment being the Fiat Panda Cross, though the Suzuki Ignis helped bring the segment more attention. Cars in this segment are generally styled as hatchbacks.

Since the late 2010s, the segment has received significantly more attention. , examples include the Toyota Aygo X, Hyundai Casper, Suzuki Ignis, Renault Kwid, VinFast VF 5, Suzuki Xbee, and the Fiat Panda Cross/City Cross.

=== Subcompact crossover SUV (B-segment) ===


Subcompact crossover SUVs (also called B-segment crossover SUV, B-SUV, small SUV) are crossovers that are usually based on the platform of a subcompact (also known as supermini or B-segment) passenger car, although some high-end subcompact crossover models are based on a compact car (C-segment).

The segment may be called differently depending on the market. In several regions, the category may be known as &quot;compact crossover&quot; or &quot;compact SUV&quot; instead.

This category is particularly popular in Europe, India, and Brazil, where it accounted for 37, 75, and 69% respectively of total SUV sales in 2018. In the United States, it accounted for 7% of total SUV sales in 2018. The best-selling vehicle in the segment in 2019 was the Honda HR-V, with 622,154 units being recorded as having been sold worldwide.

=== Compact crossover SUV (C-segment) ===

A compact crossover SUV (also called C-segment SUV or C-SUV) is a vehicle that is usually based on the platform of a compact car (C-segment), while some models are based on a mid-size car (D-segment) or a subcompact (B-segment) platform. Most compact crossovers have two-row seating, but some have three rows.

The naming of the segment may differ depending on the market. In several regions outside North America, the category may be known as &quot;mid-size crossover&quot; or &quot;mid-size SUV&quot;, not to be confused with the North American definition of a mid-size crossover SUV, which is a larger D-segment crossover SUV.

The first compact crossover was the 1980 AMC Eagle that was based on the compact-sized Concord line. Its four-wheel drive system was an almost unheard-of feature on regular passenger cars at the time, and it came with full-time all-wheel drive, automatic transmission, power steering, power front disk brakes as standard, and numerous convenience and comfort options. Later models included the 1994 Toyota RAV4, 1995 Honda CR-V, 1997 Subaru Forester, 2000 Nissan X-Trail, 2000 Mazda Tribute, and the 2001 Ford Escape. 

Between 2005 and 2010, the market share of compact crossovers in the US increased from 6 to more than 11%. In 2014, for the first time ever, sales of compact crossovers outpaced mid-size sedans in the United States.

In 2019, the American magazine &quot;Car and Driver&quot; stated that &quot;so many of these vehicles are crowding the marketplace, simply sorting through them can be a daunting task&quot;. Due to its popularity and to cater to customers&#x27; needs, many manufacturers offer more than one compact crossover, usually in slightly different sizes at different price points.

By the late 2010s, the segment had emerged as the most popular segment in several regions. For example, nearly 1 in every 4 cars (24.2%) sold in the United States in 2019 was a compact crossover. It also comprised 5.6% of the total European car market. The best-selling vehicle in the segment in 2019 was the Toyota RAV4, with 961,918 units sold globally.

In late 2020 the Volkswagen ID.4 and Ford Mustang Mach-E debuted as battery electric compact crossover SUVs.

=== Mid-size crossover SUV (D/E-segment) ===
A mid-size crossover SUV is a class of crossover SUVs that is larger than compact crossover SUVs, but smaller than full-size crossover SUVs. Mid-size crossover SUVs are usually based on the platform of a mid-size (also known as a large family car or a D-segment) passenger car, while some models are based on a full-size car (F-segment) or a compact (C-segment) platform. Some mid-size crossovers have three rows of seats, while others have two rows, which led to several brands offering multiple models to cater to both sub-segments (for example, the Honda Pilot three row crossover and its two row derivative, the Honda Passport). In Australia, American mid-sized crossovers are classified as large SUVs.

The first mid-size crossovers included the Toyota Highlander and Pontiac Aztek, both introduced in 2000 for the 2001 model year. 

The segment is most popular in North America and China, where larger vehicles are preferred. It makes up 15.8% of the total United States car market. In Europe, the segment covers 2.1% of the total market in 2019 with luxury crossover SUVs dominating most of the share.

The Toyota Highlander/Kluger was the best-selling vehicle in the category in 2018, with 387,869 sold worldwide.

=== Full-size crossover SUV ===


Full-size crossover SUVs are the largest crossovers and offer exclusively three row seating. The first full-size crossovers included the Ford Freestyle, GMC Acadia, Saturn Outlook, and the Buick Enclave, with older full-size SUVs being built mostly above a body-on-frame chassis. The full-size crossover SUV class is sometimes considered to include the three-row mid-size crossover class, as in the case of the Jeep Grand Cherokee L.

Full-size crossover SUVs are not necessarily based on full-size cars, even if an automaker still has a full-size passenger car in their lineup. For instance the Mercedes-Benz GLS shares its architecture with the mid-size Mercedes-Benz GLE and not the full-size Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan, even though the GLS is marketed as the crossover SUV counterpart to the S-Class.

== Body style categories ==

=== Three-door crossover ===
While three-door body-on-frame SUVs are not uncommon, crossover SUVs with three doors (including the tailgate door) are less prevalent. The decline of two or three-door vehicles, in general, has led to the decline of this category.

=== Coupe crossover ===

Crossover SUVs with a sloping rear roofline may be marketed as a &quot;coupe crossover SUV&quot; or &quot;coupe SUV&quot;. Although the term &quot;coupe&quot; itself is supposed to refer to a passenger car with a sloping or truncated rear roofline and usually two doors (although some manufacturers have created a four-door coupé), most coupé crossover SUVs are equipped with five doors. The sloping roofline is designed to offer a styling advantage over its standard crossover counterpart, although others suggest that this is less attractive. The body style has attracted criticism as being more expensive and less practical than normal crossovers. The BMW X6 is credited to be the first coupe crossover.

=== Convertible crossover ===
The first crossover convertible was the AMC Eagle marketed by AMC dealers during the 1981 and 1982 model years as the Sundancer, a factory-authorized conversion of the all-wheel-drive two-door sedans.

Several convertible crossover SUVs have entered mass production, including the Toyota RAV4 convertible. Released in North America in the 1998 model year, it was offered through the 1999 model year. Other examples include the Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet, Range Rover Evoque Convertible, and Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet.

This category was heavily criticized by journalists, enthusiasts, and analysts for numerous reasons, such as its design and high price tag. Some also questioned its purpose, as the practicality that crossovers usually have did not carryover to the convertible version, since it could only have two doors and little luggage space.

== Crossover-styled cars ==
Many manufacturers have capitalized on the SUV trend by offering a version of station wagons, hatchbacks, or MPVs with a raised ride height and the addition of rugged-looking accessories such as a black plastic wheel arch extension kit, body cladding, skid plates, and roof rails. Due to their raised ground clearance, these vehicles may then be marketed as more capable off-road. Some of them may also be equipped with an all-wheel-drive. This strategy has been used by manufacturers to move models upmarket or to help fill an absence in a crossover SUV segment. These vehicles have been described as pseudo-crossovers.

=== Station wagon ===
Many manufacturers have released &quot;off-road&quot; versions of station wagons, with larger cargo space and greater practicality, that are marketed as more capable in soft off-road or all-weather situations due to their raised ground clearance, making them a &quot;crossover&quot; between a station wagon and an SUV. In North America, some manufacturers sell station wagons with crossover styling due to the former&#x27;s unpopularity, the Subaru Outback being the most popular model.

An early model of off-road-styled station wagons was the Subaru Legacy Outback (later Outback) in 1994. At the time, Subaru was absent in the growing SUV segment. Lacking the finances to design a ground-up SUV, Subaru added a two-tone paint scheme, body cladding, and a suspension lift to the Legacy wagon. It was marketed as a capable and more efficient alternative to larger truck-based SUVs. Another example is the Volvo V70 XC (also called V70 Cross Country), first introduced in 1999. In 2002, the model was renamed the XC70. Audi has been making Allroad versions of their station wagons since 1999. The Volkswagen Alltrack and Škoda Scout are equivalent variants.

=== Crossover Hatchback ===
The crossover-styled variant of hatchbacks or city cars with the same body was introduced either as a substitute for or a complement to the subcompact crossover SUV. Most crossover-styled hatchbacks do not have all-wheel-drive. Forerunners of the SUV-themed hatchback are the 1983 Fiat Panda 4x4, the 1994 Outback Sport, the 1996 Toyota Starlet Remix, and the 2003 Rover Streetwise. The Volkswagen Golf Country, a conversion by Steyr-Daimler-Puch, was also sold between 1990 and 1991, and was offered with part-time four-wheel drive and off-road exterior cladding. In the 2000s, the Volkswagen CrossPolo started the modern crossover-style hatchback trend and was marketed as an SUV-like &quot;lifestyle&quot; vehicle. The Dacia/Renault Sandero Stepway, the crossover-style version of the Sandero launched in 2009, is an example of a well-received crossover-style hatchback, making up 65% of Sandero sales.

=== MPV/minivan ===
One of the first MPVs with a crossover-style variant was the Renault Scénic RX4, introduced in 2000. It featured a lifted ride height, rugged body cladding, tailgate-mounted spare wheel, and optional part-time four-wheel-drive. Another example is the Volkswagen CrossTouran, launched in 2006 as a lifted version of the Touran and marketed as a &quot;lifestyle&quot; vehicle. Apart from crossover-style variants equipped with exterior accessories, due to the increasing crossover market shares, many manufacturers began developing MPVs from the ground up with crossover characteristics – and often marketed them either purely as an MPV or as a &quot;crossover MPV&quot; – such as the 5th generation of Renault Espace.

=== Crossover Sedan ===
The innovative unibody all-wheel drive AMC Eagle was available in two- and four-door sedan versions when introduced in 1979.

Some examples of sedans with crossover characteristics are the Subaru Legacy SUS (short for &quot;Sport Utility Sedan&quot;), Volvo S60 Cross Country, Polestar 2, Toyota Crown Crossover, Citroën C4 X and C3L in China, Renault/Dacia Logan Stepway and the Qoros 3 GT.

== Sales ==

=== Europe ===
Since the early 2010s, sales of crossover-type vehicles have been increasing in Europe. By 2017, European sales of compact and mid-sized crossover models continued to surge. Analysis of the European new car market by data firm JATO Dynamics reveals that SUVs which mostly consisted of crossovers took almost 40% of the market in 2019, with the crossover segment being a key driver of growth for volume and profits.

=== United States ===
Sales of crossovers increased by 30% between 2003 and 2005. By 2006, the segment came into strong visibility in the U.S., when crossover sales &quot;made up more than 50% of the overall SUV market&quot;. Sales increased in 2007 by 16%. In 2013, the Audi Q5 became Audi&#x27;s second best-selling vehicle in the United States market after the Audi A4 sedan. Between the late 1990s and 2012, around half of Lexus&#x27;s sales came from its SUVs.

American manufacturers were initially slow to switch from their emphasis on light truck-based SUVs, and foreign automakers developed crossovers targeting the U.S. market as an alternative to station wagons that were unpopular there. By the early 2000s, American car manufacturers had caught up.

=== China ===
The crossover segment has been the fastest-growing category in China&#x27;s passenger car market since the early 2010s. From 2011 to 2021, the market share of crossovers in China&#x27;s passenger vehicle sales surged by nearly 35 percentage points, rising from approximately 13% in 2011 to 47.89% in 2021. A 2017 survey by Mintel indicated that Chinese consumers were willing to pay a premium for SUVs, with the median first-time buyer spending RMB 205,000.

By 2023, several crossover models dominated the list of overall best-selling vehicles in China. The Tesla Model Y emerged as the best-selling car across all segments. Other popular crossover models included the BYD Song Plus and Yuan Plus, which ranked 4th and 5th respectively, and the Haval H6, which took the 10th spot. In 2023, Land Rover experienced significant growth in the Chinese market. Combined sales of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport surpassed 25,000 units, representing a 31% year-over-year increase, whilst sales of the Land Rover Discovery grew by 14% year-over-year.

<text>The Water Method Man (1972) is the second published novel by American novelist John Irving.

==Plot summary==
The novel revolves around the mishaps of its narrator, Fred Trumper, a floundering late-twenty-something graduate student with serious commitment and honesty issues that earn him the nickname &quot;Bogus.&quot; The novel shows Irving beginning to develop a blend of comedy and pathos, as well as a penchant for fashioning quirky characters. It follows a non-linear narrative in the form of a sort of &quot;confession&quot; authored by Trumper, who humorously recounts his various failures in life and love, from his New England childhood through his experiences on foreign study in Vienna, Austria, and as a graduate student in Iowa, leading up to the present-action setting, early-1970s New York, where Trumper is attempting to sever himself from his adolescent past. &quot;I want to change&quot;, Trumper says at the end of Chapter One. The phrase seems to be the novel&#x27;s central theme.

The title refers to a method prescribed to Trumper for the treatment of non-specific urological disorders relating to his abnormally narrow urinary tract. Trumper&#x27;s urologist, Dr. Jean Claude Vigneron, offers him three options for the treatment of his disorder: abstinence from sex and alcohol, a painful operation to widen the urinary canal, or the Water Method, which consists simply of consuming abnormal quantities of water before and after sex to flush bacteria out of the urinary tract. Trumper opts for the Water Method, suggesting both his generally comical cowardice and lack of self-discipline.

Trumper&#x27;s narration meanders through flashbacks revolving around his relationships with the novel&#x27;s two primary female characters: Sue &quot;Biggie&quot; Kunft, a former championship downhill skier whom Trumper courts, impregnates, and marries in Vienna while still a student, and Tulpen, Trumper&#x27;s present day live-in girlfriend, a documentary film editor in New York, where he lands after losing Biggie. Though the two relationships function chiefly as a means of demonstrating Bogus Trumper&#x27;s tendency to repeat his mistakes, Irving is often noted for his strong, independent female characters, and Tulpen and Biggie can be seen as markers in the development of the strong women in his more popularly successful novels, particularly &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1979).

Other characters include Trumper&#x27;s best childhood friend Couth, a still-photographer; Merrill Overturf, an alcoholic and diabetic loon Trumper befriends in Vienna; Ralph Packer, a pretentious documentary filmmaker who employs Trumper as a sound editor; and Colm, Trumper&#x27;s young son from his first marriage to Biggie.

Trumper is a graduate student at the University of Iowa in comparative literature whose thesis is to be a translation of an ancient, &quot;Old Low Norse&quot; epic called &quot;Akthelt and Gunnel&quot;. Irving employs the &quot;Akthelt and Gunnel&quot; poem as a means for allowing Trumper to poke merciless fun at himself through analogously inventing the story of the poem according to his own life&#x27;s mishaps.

==Reception==
In a 1972 review, Kirkus acknowledged the book&#x27;s &quot;tremendous comic drive.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; greeted the novel with enthusiasm: &quot;Brutal reality and hallucination, comedy and pathos. A rich, unified tapestry.&quot;

<text>Equitation is the art or practice of horse riding or horsemanship.

More specifically, equitation may refer to a rider&#x27;s position while mounted, and encompasses a rider&#x27;s ability to ride correctly and with effective aids. In horse show competition, the rider, rather than the horse is evaluated. Such classes go by different names, depending on region, including &quot;equitation classes&quot;, &quot;rider classes&quot;, or &quot;horsemanship classes.&quot; Judging criteria covers the rider&#x27;s performance and control of the horse, use of riding aids, proper attire, correct form, and usually factor in rider poise and the cleanliness and polish of horse, rider and equipment. The performance of the horse is not judged &quot;per se&quot;, but a poorly performing horse is considered to reflect the ability of the rider. Equitation classes occur in the Hunt seat, Saddle seat, Dressage, and Western disciplines. A good equitation rider is always in balance with the horse, maintains a correct position in every gait, movement, or over a fence, and possesses a commanding, but relaxed, presence, able to direct the horse with nearly invisible aids.

==Hunt seat equitation==
The hunt seat style of riding is derived from the hunt field.

In equitation competition, &quot;flat classes&quot; (those that do not including jumping) include judging at the walk, trot, and canter in both directions, and the competitors may be asked to ride without stirrups or perform assorted other tests or patterns. It is correct for the riders to have a light and steady contact with their horse&#x27;s mouth the entire ride. Incorrect leads, break of pace, and wrong diagonals are penalized. Loss of a stirrup or dropping the reins are also faults, and may be cause for elimination. Bridles and bits permitted in these classes are more traditional hunter-style tack, i.e. snaffles and pelhams along with cavesson nosebands.

In &quot;over fences&quot; classes (classes in which the horse and rider jump obstacles), the competitor rides over a course of at least six jumps (usually more). Equitation over fence classes rarely have fences higher than . Classes for more accomplished riders may require at least one flying lead change, and one or more combinations. The rider is judged not only on position and effectiveness of riding aids, but should also maintain an even, forward pace and meet each fence at an appropriate distance. Additional jumper-type tack is permitted including gags and two or three-ring bits as well as flash, drop, and figure eight nosebands. Additionally, if martingales are used, they must be running martingales.

At the highest level of hunt seat equitation in North America are the national ASPCA Maclay Finals, the USET Talent Search Finals, the WIHS Equitation Finals, and USEF Medal classes in the United States, and the CET (Canadian Equestrian Team) Medal and Jump Canada Medal in Canada. These championships and their qualifying classes may include bending lines, roll back turns, narrow fences, and fences with a long approach to test the rider. Fences must be at least 3&#x27;6&quot; and may be up to 5&#x27; wide, and the course must have at least eight obstacles and at least one combination. The course may include liverpool or open water elements, depending on the class and region specifications. The USET Talent Search Finals always includes an open water element.

Equitation tests may be chosen by the judge to help place the top riders. These tests are required in the medal classes. Tests may include a halt for several seconds, rein back, demonstration of the hand gallop, figure-8 at the trot or canter with correct diagonals or leads (simple change of lead or flying), trotting or cantering low fences (up to 3&#x27;), jump obstacles at the walk (up to 2&#x27;), jumping fences on a figure-8, oral questions regarding tack, equipment, conformation, and basic horsemanship, riding without stirrups, performing a turn on the forehand or haunches, and a serpentine at the trot or canter with flying changes. Riders may also be asked to switch horses at higher levels of competition, such as at a national final. Switching of horses is no longer common at smaller competitions, usually only championships, due to the risks involved. The Intercollegiate Horse Shows Association (IHSA) welcomes men and women of all levels of riding in both hunter seat equitation, on the flat and over fences and Western horsemanship in a range of programs from varsity to club sports at colleges and universities across the United States and Canada. The National Collegiate Equestrian Association (NCEA) mainly focuses on hunt seat equitation. Riders (women only) wanting to compete in the college division 1 teams need prior knowledge on riding hunt seat equitation to be considered for the teams.

==Saddle seat equitation==
Saddle seat is a uniquely American form of riding that grew out of a style of riding used on Southern plantations, with some European influences from &quot;Park&quot; or Sunday exhibition riding of high-stepping horses in public venues (often literally, city parks). Today it is seen most often at horse shows organized for exhibitors of the American Saddlebred, Morgan, Arabian, Tennessee Walking Horse, and the National Show Horse. It is also sometimes seen in competition for Andalusian horses. There are open and breed-specific national championships as well as an international championship held every other year.

Gaits shown in Saddle Seat classes include the walk, trot, and canter. Some competitions may call for extended gaits, particularly the trot. When showing a Tennessee Walking Horse they will be required to perform a flat walk and running walk. Some class will also require a canter. All classes require &quot;Rail work&quot;, where competitors show and are judged as a group going both ways of the arena. Saddle seat equitation may include individual tests or a pattern to be ridden. Tests may include backing up, mounting and dismounting, riding without stirrups, &quot;addressing&quot; the reins (i.e. picking up the four or two reins correctly), figure eights, serpentines and straight line patterns done at any gait. At the canter, only simple changes of lead are required when changing directions. It is possible to have a &quot;ride-off,&quot; where two or more riders are asked to perform additional work to determine the winner.

Correct position for the rider is to have the ear, shoulder, hip, and heel in a line. He/she is also to have a straight line from knee to toe, and from elbow to wrist to the horse&#x27;s bit. The rider&#x27;s back should be straight yet relaxed, and the legs and arms are to remain virtually motionless.

The informal dress for saddle seat equitation includes a coat and Kentucky jodhpurs of a dark, conservative color, e.g., herringbone, pin stripes, black, blue, grey, dark burgundy, dark green or beige; a white or pastel collared shirt with a tie; derby or soft hat; and jodhpur boots. Vests and gloves are optional. After 6 p.m. formal wear is required. This habit includes a tuxedo-style jacket, pants and vest with bow tie and formal shirt, and top hat.

Pleasure equitation is another form of saddle seat equitation in which a rider is required to wear informal dress (coat, jodhpur pants, derby or soft hat, all in a dark color) in the day and evening and ride a horse that has a full mane and tail which is not set. The horses used are of a less animated style than in open competition, such as a country pleasure horse. The Morgan equivalent of this class is called Classic Saddle Seat Equitation.

The value given to rail work and pattern work varies from qualifying competition to championship competition.

==Western equitation==


Western equitation (sometimes called Western horsemanship, stock seat equitation, or, in some classes, reining seat equitation) competitions are judged at the walk, jog, and lope in both directions. Some classes require individual patterns. Riders must sit to the jog and never post.

Riders must use a Western saddle and a curb bit, and may only use one hand to hold the reins while riding. Two hands are allowed if the horse is ridden in a snaffle bit or hackamore, which are only permitted for use on younger, &quot;junior&quot; horses, defined differently by various breed associations, but usually referring to horses four or five years of age and younger. Horses are not allowed to wear a noseband or cavesson, nor any type of protective boot or bandage, except during some tests that require a reining pattern.

Riders are allowed two different styles of reins: 1) split reins, which are not attached to each other, and thus the rider is allowed to place one finger between the reins to aid in making adjustments; and 2) &quot;romal reins,&quot; which are joined together and have a romal (a type of long quirt) on the end, which the rider holds in his/her non-reining hand, with at least 16 inches of slack between the two, and the rider is not allowed to place a finger between the reins.

The correct position for this discipline, as in all forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider&#x27;s ear, shoulder, hip, and heel.

The Western style is seen in a long stirrup length, often longer than that used by dressage riders, an upright posture (equitation riders are never to lean forward beyond a very slight inclination), and the distinctive one-handed hold on the reins. The reining hand should be bent at the elbow, held close to the rider&#x27;s side, and centered over the horse&#x27;s neck, usually within an inch of the saddle horn. Due to the presence of the saddle horn, a true straight line between rider&#x27;s hand and horse&#x27;s mouth is usually not possible. The non-reining hand either holds onto the romal, if one is used; or if split reins are used, is held in a still position, which varies as styles change, but often is also bent at the elbow and held close to the pommel of the saddle.

==Dressage seat equitation==

Dressage seat equitation is a relatively new class offered at dressage shows. Unlike a dressage test, the horse&#x27;s gaits are not judged, although the horse&#x27;s frame is taken into consideration by the judge, but rather it is the rider who is evaluated. Also, instead of a single competitor in the ring, there are several riders in the ring at one time.

The rider is judged on a proper classical position. This includes evaluating leg position, seat, hands, balance, and rhythm. The rider is to be relaxed and not interfere with the horse&#x27;s movement, but able to make full use of all riding aids. The rider and horse should have unity, and the rider should use the aids correctly and efficiently.

The United States Equestrian Federation outlines the rules for Dressage Seat Equitation.

<text>Edgar Dawn Ross &quot;Ted&quot; Honderich (30 January 1933 – 12 October 2024) was a Canadian-born British philosopher, who was Grote Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic, University College London.

==Biography==
Honderich was born on 30 January 1933 in Baden, Ontario, Canada, the younger brother of Beland Honderich, who became publisher of the Toronto Star. An undergraduate at the University of Toronto, qualifying as B.A. (Hons) in Philosophy and English Literature, he came to University College London to study under the logical positivist and Grote Professor A. J. Ayer, graduating with a PhD in 1968. He subsequently lived in England and became a British citizen. After being a lecturer at the University of Sussex he became lecturer, reader, professor and then Grote Professor at University College London. He was visiting professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Yale and the universities of Bath and Calgary. He was author of many books and articles on such subjects as consciousness, determinism, qualia, functionalism, timings of sensory experiences, psychophysical intimacy, the correspondence theory of truth, Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions, time, causation, Mill&#x27;s &quot;On Liberty&quot;, John Searle&#x27;s view of free will and G. A. Cohen&#x27;s defence of Marx&#x27;s theory of history. He also edited several series of philosophy books.

He was involved in controversy for his moral defence of Palestinian political violence, despite his justification of the founding and maintaining of Israel in its original 1948 borders.

His papers in philosophical journals have been published in three volumes by Edinburgh University Press. He appeared on radio and television, was the editor of &quot;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot;, wrote a philosophical autobiography, was chairman of the Royal Institute of Philosophy where he inaugurated the annual lectures subsequently published as &quot;Philosophers of Our Times,&quot; and he was an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. 

Honderich was married to Ingrid Coggin. He died on 12 October 2024, at the age of 91.

==Consciousness==
Honderich&#x27;s theory of consciousness in the long book &quot;Actual Consciousness&quot; and the precis-book &quot;Your Being Conscious is What? Where?&quot; replaces entirely his philosophy of mind in &quot;A Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience and Life-Hopes&quot; and the precis-book &quot;How Free Are You?&quot;. The new theory derives from a database to the effect that being conscious, figuratively speaking, is something&#x27;s being actual. This issues, by way of (a) speculation that disagreement about consciousness is significantly owed to no adequate initial clarification of the subject matter, and (b) examination of five leading ideas of consciousness and existing theories of consciousness, and (c) a specification of the objective physical world, into the wholly literal theory or analysis of the nature of consciousness called Actualism. It distinguishes three sides of consciousness: (1) perceptual consciousness—consciousness in perception, (2) cognitive consciousness, and (3) affective consciousness. In each case the theory satisfies the two primary criteria of explaining what is actual, and what its being actual consists in.

In the case of perceptual consciousness what is actual is only a subjective physical world out there. I.e. being perceptually conscious is essentially or primarily a state of affairs external to the perceiver. Its being actual is its being subjectively physical, which is specified. In the case of cognitive and affective consciousness, what is actual is representations, internal to the conscious thing, and their being actual is their being subjectively physical, differently so from subjective physical worlds. Actualism argues, further, that it satisfies further criteria better than other existing theories of consciousness including one of subjectivity, individuality or personal identity, and that it is relevant to desires for human standing that are the motivation of beliefs in free will as against determinism. Actualism has been received as a new and arguable theory by philosophers who have previously declared the urgent need for one. A predecessor of the theory is discussed by 11 other philosophers in &quot;Radical Externalism: Honderich&#x27;s Theory of Consciousness Discussed&quot;, ed. Anthony Freeman, Imprint Academic.

==Determinism and freedom==
In &quot;A Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience and Life-Hopes&quot; and in the precis-book &quot;How Free Are You?&quot;, Honderich expounds a theory of causation as well as other lawlike connections. This he uses to formulate three hypotheses of a deterministic philosophy of mind. They are argued to be true, mainly on the basis of neuroscience. The clarity of determinism is contrasted with the obscurity of the doctrines of free will or origination.

The centuries-dominant philosophical traditions of determinism and freedom, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism, are examined. According to the first, determinism is consistent with our freedom and moral responsibility; according to the second, it is inconsistent with them. Honderich considers Compatibilism&#x27;s argument that our freedom consists in voluntariness, doing what we desire and not being coerced; hence its conclusion that determinism and freedom can go together. He also examines Incompatibilism&#x27;s argument that our freedom consists in origination or free will, our choosing without our choosing&#x27;s being caused; hence the conclusion that determinism and freedom are inconsistent.

Honderich argues that both views are mistaken, since freedom as voluntariness and freedom as origination are each as fundamental to our lives. The real problem of the consequences of determinism is not choosing between the two traditional doctrines, but a more practical one: trying to give up what must be given up, since we do not have the power of origination. Honderich&#x27;s rejection of both traditions has been taken up by other philosophers, many of whom find his criticisms decisive.

==Mind and brain==
Honderich&#x27;s Union Theory of mind and brain is defended in &quot;A Theory of Determinism&quot;. The Union Theory takes it as possible that conscious events like our choices and decisions are in a way subjective but are nevertheless physical rather than near-physical events. They stand in a kind of lawlike connection with neural events, sometimes called the supervenience of mental events on neural events. These psychoneural pairs, as Honderich calls them, are just effects of certain causal sequences, and are causes of our actions. This sort of physicalism, a predecessor to the notion of supervenience, has since been succeeded in Honderich&#x27;s writings by the near-physicalism of Radical Externalism. Radical Externalism holds that perceptual consciousness does not have a nomic sufficient condition in a head but only a necessary one. Honderich argues that reflective and affective consciousness are different again. He also argues that this is consistent with contemporary neuroscience, rescues us from the argument from illusion or brain in a vat, and also from the dubious conclusions of sense-data theory and phenomenalism.

==The Principle of Humanity==
Honderich argues that the Principle of Humanity is that what is right always consists in what, according to the best available knowledge and judgement, are actually rational steps, effective and not self-defeating ones rather than pretences, to the end of getting and keeping people out of bad lives. Bad lives are defined as those deprived of six fundamental human goods: a decent length of life, bodily well-being, freedom and power in various settings, respect and self-respect, the goods of relationship, and the goods of culture. It is a consequentialist principle, but not the principle of utility, nor of course the claim that the ends justify the means. Honderich argues that the principle is fundamental to but not the whole of a morality of humanity. This, he claims, includes certain policies of equality and inequality and certain practices, one being a better democracy than we have. Honderich concludes that the Principle of Humanity is better supported than any other sort of moral principle, on the basis of both consistency and certain facts. He takes it that non-consequentialist reasons are not really reasons at all, nor, he says, does the Principle grant any distinction between acts and omissions.

==International right and wrong, democracy, terrorism==
Following 9/11, Honderich published &quot;After the Terror&quot;. The author first lays out premises for what he terms the &quot;bad lives&quot; and &quot;good lives&quot;, of those living in Africa and in rich countries respectively. With respect to bad lives, Honderich argues that our omissions have resulted in 20 million years of possible living-time lost by a certain sample of Africans. He also considers the creation of Israel in 1948 and records what he describes as the bad lives of Palestinians as a result of what is called the neo-Zionist expansion of Israel since the 1967 war. Honderich asks whether those in the rich societies do wrong in doing nothing about bad lives. He considers natural morality as well as our worked-out or philosophical moralities. Such outlooks as political realism and such ideologies as liberalism and libertarianism are also considered, as is what Honderich calls &#x27;hierarchic democracy&#x27;. The Principle of Humanity is used to judge our moral responsibility for the many bad lives, which Honderich tells us is great. The Principle also condemns the terrorist killings of 11 September as hideous. The killings were not rational means to an end that was partly defensible. The West&#x27;s subsequent attack on Afghanistan is excused. But the taking from Palestinians of at least their freedom in the last fifth of their homeland, historic Palestine, is condemned. Honderich writes: &#x27;...the Palestinians have had a moral right to their terrorism as certain as was the moral right, say, of the African people of South Africa against their white captors and the apartheid state&#x27;.

Honderich claims that we need to see the power of our societies as deadly. Americans, first of all, because of their unique power, need to think more carefully about their actions. He also argues that we should supplement our democracies with the transformations of the civil disobedience of Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King Jr., Bertrand Russell, and those in Eastern Europe who brought down the wall.

His later book, &quot;Humanity, Terrorism, Terrorist War: Palestine, 9/11, Iraq, 7/7...&quot; begins by asking if analytic philosophy in considering large questions of right and wrong should proceed by embracing international law, human rights, just war theory or the like. Honderich, finding these means of judgement wanting, again takes up the Principle of Humanity. The book justifies and defends Zionism, defined as the creation of Israel in its original borders, but also reaffirms that Palestinians have had a moral right to their liberation—to terrorism within historic Palestine against what Honderich calls the ethnic cleansing of Neo-Zionism, the expansion of Israel beyond its original borders. After a further consideration of 9/11, there is an analysis of 10 reasons for what he calls &#x27;our terrorist war&#x27; in Iraq. Honderich condemns the war as morally barbaric, given the foreseen and thus intentional killing of many innocents. In condemning the 7/7 terrorist attack on London, Honderich considers the importance of horror to morality. He also argues that Tony Blair and George W. Bush are friends rather than enemies of terrorism. The book ends with a postscript on the charge of anti-semitism against critics of neo-Zionism – a charge Honderich says is principally a part of Neo-Zionism or at least something insufficiently detached from it.

In January 2011, Honderich wrote a letter to the Guardian on terrorism, in response to details released about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process:
==Punishment==
In &quot;Punishment: The Supposed Justifications&quot;, Honderich surveys and analyses 14 traditional, backward-looking reasons for the justification of punishment by the state. Most have to do with desert or retribution, others with annulment or consent. All are found to be weak or worse. Honderich then argues that the strong tradition of punishment must have in it some real content or argument. This is found to be that punishment is justified by giving satisfaction to grievance-desires—doing no more than satisfying them. This, Honderich concludes, is the reality of retributivism, but it cannot be an effective justification of punishment. The Utilitarian prevention theory of punishment is also rejected, because it justifies certain victimisations. Mixed theories of punishment, drawing on backward-looking considerations as well as the notion of prevention, sometimes in terms of the reform of offenders, are also found to be untenable. Robert Nozick&#x27;s theory in particular is examined. Honderich&#x27;s conclusion is that the long-running problem of the justification of punishment is now dead. Its justification must be in terms of its consequences—in discouraging and licensing certain kinds of behaviour. The live issue is determining what these are. Honderich&#x27;s answer has to do with the Principle of Humanity. Punishment is or would be justified when it rationally takes forward the humanisation of our societies. He argues, on the basis of this, that most punishments are in fact wrong.

==Conservatism==
Honderich&#x27;s book &quot;Conservatism&quot; begins with a general inquiry into the distinctions between British and American conservatism. He argues that one [British conservatism?] has to do with eternal values and therefore with reform rather than change, a view underpinning Edmund Burke&#x27;s condemnation of the French Revolution and all conservatives since. Other distinctions have to do with the right kind of political thinking and with human nature, with particular doctrines of incentive and reward, and with certain freedoms, including those of private property. Given these distinctions which set conservatism apart from other views, Honderich asks what underlies and brings these distinctions together. What is the rationale or underlying principle of conservatism? The answer he gives is not just that the conservative tradition is selfish. Its self-interest, he argues, does not distinguish it from other political traditions. What does distinguish it, Honderich concludes, is that it lacks a moral principle to defend its self-interest. It is unique in its amorality. &quot;Conservatism&quot; was enlarged as &quot;Conservatism: Burke, Nozick, Bush, Blair?&quot; in 2005, and includes Honderich&#x27;s consideration of whether Britain&#x27;s New Labour is truly in the conservative political tradition.

==Controversy==
Honderich has been involved in controversy since the publication of his book &quot;After the Terror&quot; in 2002. Honderich arranged with Oxfam in Britain and the publisher of &quot;After the Terror&quot;, Edinburgh University Press, to have the £5,000 advance on royalties go to the charity, along with more money from the publishers. The Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; suggested that Oxfam was taking money from a terrorist sympathiser, and it then declined the contributions, for which it was judged adversely in the British media. The book was published in a German translation. Micha Brumlik, director of a Holocaust centre and Professor of Pedagogy at Frankfurt University, demanded publicly that the book be withdrawn from sale by the publisher, Suhrkamp Verlag. Despite the declaration by the philosopher Jürgen Habermas, who had recommended the translation, that the book was not anti-semitic, it was withdrawn from sale. Honderich demanded the dismissal of Brumlik from his professorship, for violation of academic principle. There was a media furore in Germany. The book was retranslated and republished by an antizionist Jewish publishing house, Melzer Verlag. Lesser controversies have included an imputation of anti-semitism by a student newspaper in London, against which Honderich took successful legal action. There have been attacks by Palestinians on Honderich&#x27;s justification of Zionism too, including disruptions at meetings.

==Other writings==
Honderich wrote a number of papers in criticism of Donald Davidson&#x27;s Anomalous Monism, and in particular made the objection that on certain assumptions the view is epiphenomenalist. The papers are reprinted in &quot;Mental Causation and the Metaphysics of Mind&quot;, edited by Neil Campbell. Earlier journal papers are about Austin&#x27;s correspondence theory of truth, causation, time, Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions, and John Stuart Mill&#x27;s essay &quot;On Liberty&quot;. Honderich&#x27;s philosophical autobiography, &quot;Philosopher: A Kind of Life&quot;, is a personal and general picture of English academic life over several decades. An encyclopaedia edited by him, &quot;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot;, is in its second edition.

<text>In Shinto and Buddhism in Japan, an or is a talisman made out of various materials such as paper, wood, cloth or metal. are commonly found in both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples and are considered to be imbued with the power of the deities () or Buddhist figures revered therein.

Certain kinds of are intended for a specific purpose (such as protection against calamity or misfortune, safety within the home, or finding love) and may be kept on one&#x27;s person or placed on other areas of the home (such as gates, doorways, kitchens, or ceilings). Paper may also be referred to as , while those made of wood may be called . , another kind of Japanese talisman, shares the same origin as and may be considered as a smaller and portable version of .

A specific type of is a talisman issued by a Shinto shrine on which is written the name of the shrine or its enshrined and stamped with the shrine&#x27;s seal. Such , also called , or , are often placed on household Shinto altars () and revered both as a symbol of the shrine and its deity (or deities) – containing the &#x27;s essence or power by virtue of its consecration – and a medium through which the in question can be accessed by the worshiper. In this regard they are somewhat similar to (but not the same as) , physical objects which serve as repositories for in Shinto shrines.

In a similar vein, Buddhist are regarded as imbued with the spirit and the virtue of buddhas, bodhisattvas, or other revered figures of the Buddhist pantheon, essentially functioning in many cases as a more economic alternative to Buddhist icons and statuary.

==History==

The origins of Shinto and Buddhist may be traced from both the Taoist , introduced to Japan via Onmyōdō (which adopted elements of Taoism), and woodblock prints of Buddhist texts and images produced by temples since the Nara and Heian periods. During the medieval period, the three shrines of Kumano in Wakayama Prefecture stamped their paper talismans on one side with intricate designs of stylized crows and were called or the . At the time, these and similar were often employed in oath taking and contract drafting, with the terms of the oath or agreement being written on the blank side of the sheet.

The currently found in most Shinto shrines meanwhile are modeled after the talisman issued by the Grand Shrines of Ise (Ise Jingū) called . were originally that wandering preachers associated with the shrines of handed out to devotees across the country as a sign and guarantee that prayers were conducted on their behalf. These wands, called , were contained either in packets of folded paper – in which case they are called (also ), due to the packet&#x27;s shape resembling a – or in boxes called . The widespread distribution of first began in the Muromachi period and reached its peak in the Edo period: a document dating from 1777 (An&#x27;ei 6) indicates that eighty-nine to ninety percent of all households in the country at the time owned an Ise talisman.

In 1871, an imperial decree abolished the and allotted the production and distribution of the amulets, now renamed , to the shrine&#x27;s administrative offices. It was around this time that the talisman&#x27;s most widely known form – a wooden tablet containing a sliver of cedar wood known as wrapped in paper on which is printed the shrine&#x27;s name () and stamped with the seals of the shrine () and its high priest () – developed. In 1900, a new department, the , took over production and distribution duties. The distribution of was eventually delegated to the in 1927 and finally to its successor, the Association of Shinto Shrines, after World War II. The Association nowadays continues to disseminate to affiliated shrines throughout Japan, where they are made available alongside the shrines&#x27; own amulets.

==Varieties and usage==
 come in a variety of forms. Some are slips or sheets of paper, others like the are thin rectangular plaques () enclosed in an envelope-like casing (which may further be covered in translucent wrapping paper), while still others are wooden tablets () which may be smaller or larger than regular . Some shrines distribute , which consists of a sliver of wood placed inside a fold of paper. The issued by the shrines of Ise before the Meiji period were usually in the form of ; while the variety is currently more widespread, of the type are still distributed in Ise Shrine.
 and are available year round in many shrines and temples, especially in larger ones with a permanent staff. As these items are sacred, they are technically not &#x27;bought&#x27; but rather or , with the money paid in exchange for them being considered to be a donation or . One may also receive a wooden talisman called a after having formal prayers or rituals () performed on one&#x27;s behalf in these places of worship.

=== Shinto ===
 such as are enshrined in a household altar () or a special stand (); in the absence of one, they may be placed upright in a clean and tidy space above eye level or attached to a wall. and the that house them are set up facing east (where the sun rises), south (the principal direction of sunshine), or southeast.

The Association of Shinto Shrines recommends that a household own at least three kinds of : 
# The of the tutelary deity of one&#x27;s place of residence ()
# The of a shrine one is personally devoted to 

In a altar, the is placed in the middle, with the of one&#x27;s local on its left (observer&#x27;s right) and the of one&#x27;s favourite shrine on its right (observer&#x27;s left). Alternatively, in a , the three talismans are laid on top of one another, with the on the front. One may own more ; these are placed on either side of or behind the aforementioned three. Regular (preferably daily) worship before the or and offerings of rice, salt, water, and/or to the (with additional foodstuffs being offered on special occasions) are recommended. The manner of worship is similar to those performed in shrines: two bows, two claps, and a final bow, though a prayer () – also preceded by two bows – may be recited before this.

Other are placed in other parts of the house. For instance, of patron deities of the hearth – Sanbō-Kōjin in Buddhism, Kamado-Mihashira-no-Kami (the &#x27;Three Deities of the Hearth&#x27;: Kagutsuchi, Okitsuhiko and Okitsuhime) in Shinto – are placed in the kitchen. In toilets, a talisman of the Buddhist wrathful deity Ucchuṣma (Ususama Myōō), who is believed to purify the unclean, may be installed. Protective such as , a depiction of the Tendai monk Ryōgen in the form of a yaksha or an are placed on doorways or entrances.

Japanese spirituality lays great importance on purity and pristineness (), especially of things related to the divine. It is for this reason that periodic (usually annual) replacement of and are encouraged. It is customary to obtain new before the end of the year at the earliest or during the New Year season, though (as with ) one may purchase one at other times of the year as well. While ideally, old and are to be returned to the shrine or temple where they were obtained as a form of thanksgiving, most Shinto shrines in practice accept talismans from other shrines. (Buddhist are however not accepted in many shrines and vice versa.) Old and are burned in a ceremony known either as or , also or ) held during the Little New Year (January 14th or 15th), the end of the Japanese New Year season.

<text>Card making is the craft of hand-making greeting cards. It shares skills in common in allied crafts such as scrapbooking and stamping.

Unlike handcrafted cards, mass-produced printed greeting cards have been faced with competition from electronic greeting cards. Over seven billion greeting cards were sent in the US each year; greeting cards are a multibillion-dollar business.

Many hobbyists taking advantage of the low setup costs of web-based selling and the wide customer-base of auction sites like eBay to market their cards. Many others continue to sell their creations at craft fairs, markets and fêtes. Others use their cardmaking skills to turn a profit in the wedding planning market making handmade wedding invitations and favors.

There are many different variations of handmade cards including decoupage, more commonly known as 3D, where a design is printed a number of times, then various areas of the design are cut and layered on top of each other using double-sided sticky foam squares to mount the layers together to create the 3D effect making a very attractive greeting card.

==History==
The custom of sending greeting cards can be traced back to the ancient Chinese, who exchanged messages of good will to celebrate the New Year, and to the early Egyptians, who conveyed their greetings on papyrus scrolls.

By the early 15th century, handmade paper greeting cards were being exchanged in Europe. The Germans are known to have printed New Year&#x27;s greetings from woodcuts as early as 1400, and handmade paper Valentines were being exchanged in various parts of Europe in the early to mid-15th century.

However, by the 1850s, the greeting card had been transformed from a relatively expensive, handmade and hand-delivered gift to a popular and affordable means of personal communication, due largely to advances in printing and mechanization.

This trend continued, followed by new trends like Christmas cards, the first of which appeared in published form in London in 1843 when Sir Henry Cole hired artist John Calcott Horsley to design a holiday card that he could send to his friends and acquaintances. Technical developments like color lithography in 1930 propelled the manufactured greeting card industry forward.

During the 1980s, the trend began to turn, with consumers increasing looking for greeting cards that were differentiated from the standard offering. In the late 1990s, e-cards made their way into the market.

==Materials==
Common cardmaking materials include: cardstock, stencils, markers, vellum, tissue paper, glue, rulers and t-squares, rickrack, foil, sequins, beads, ribbon, acetate, paper embossing, die cutting machines and more. Other materials that can be used in cardmaking are brads, eyelets, tea bag medallions, and buttons. Brads can be used to hold the four corners of one piece of cardstock on top of another to create a layered effect. Eyelets can be used to draw a piece of string or ribbon from one side of the card to another. Tea bag medallions are a type of origami that makes a wonderful decoration for the front of a card. Pretty shaped buttons make nice additions to a design. Other ways of decorating cards include using rubber or polymer stamps to add images or sentiments to the card which can then be coloured or decorated using a wide variety of paint or ink techniques.</text><links>

<text>Divertissement (from the French &#x27;diversion&#x27; or &#x27;amusement&#x27;) is used, in a similar sense to the Italian &#x27;divertimento&#x27;, for a light piece of music for a small group of players, however the French term has additional meanings.

During the 17th and 18th century, the term implied incidental aspects of an entertainment (usually involving singing and dancing) that might be inserted in an opera or ballet or other stage performance. In the operas produced by the Académie Royale de Musique, both tragédies lyriques and comédies lyriques, these &#x27;divertissements&#x27; were sometimes linked to the main plot, or performed at the close of the performance. (Similar examples during the 19th century include Charles Gounod&#x27;s opera &quot;Faust&quot; and Delibes&#x27;s ballet &quot;Coppélia&quot;.)

Special entertainments of a similar kind given &quot;between&quot; the acts of an opera were called &#x27;intermèdes&#x27;.

The term is also sometimes used for a suite of loosely connected dances. One 20th-century example is Jacques Ibert&#x27;s &quot;Divertissement&quot; (1930). Jean Françaix named four of his compositions &quot;Divertissement&quot;:
*for string trio and piano (1933)
*for string trio and orchestra (1935)
*for bassoon and string quintet (or orchestra, 1942)
*for oboe, clarinet and bassoon (1945).

<text>Stephen Johnson Field (November 4, 1816 – April 9, 1899) was an American jurist. He was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court from May 20, 1863, to December 1, 1897, the second longest tenure of any justice. Prior to this appointment, he was the fifth Chief Justice of California.

==Early life and education==
Born in Haddam, Connecticut, he was the sixth of the nine children of David Dudley Field I, a Congregationalist minister, and his wife Submit Dickinson, a teacher. His family produced three other children of major prominence in 19th century America: David Dudley Field II the prominent attorney, Cyrus Field, the millionaire investor and creator of the Atlantic Cable, and Rev. Henry Martyn Field, a prominent clergyman and travel writer. He grew up in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and went to Turkey at thirteen with his sister Emilia and her missionary husband, Rev. Josiah Brewer. He received a B.A. from Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, in 1837. While attending Williams College he was one of the original Founders of Delta Upsilon fraternity. After reading law in Albany with Harmanus Bleecker and New York City with his brother David, Stephen was admitted to the bar. He practiced law with David until 1848, when he went to California during the Gold Rush.

Field was an uncle of future Associate Justice David Josiah Brewer. Other notable relatives include Paul Stephen Field and legal scholar Anne Field.

==Career in California politics and law==
In California, Field&#x27;s legal practice boomed and he was elected alcalde, a form of mayor and justice of the peace under the old Mexican rule of law, of Marysville (curiously, he was elected Alcalde just three days after his arrival in Marysville). Because the Gold Rush city could not afford a jail, and it cost too much to transport prisoners to San Francisco, Field implemented the whipping post, believing that without such a brutal implement many in the rough and tumble city would be hanged for minor crimes. The voters sent him to the California State Assembly in 1850 to represent Yuba County, but he lost a race the next year for the State Senate. His successful legal practice led to his election to the California Supreme Court in 1857, serving six years.

Field was determined and vengeful when others disagreed with him, and he easily made enemies. An opponent of his wrote that Field&#x27;s life would be &quot;found to be one series of little-mindedness, meanlinesses, of braggadocio, pusillanimity, and contemptible vanity.&quot;

While serving on the California Supreme Court, Field had a special coat made with pockets large enough to hold two pistols so that he could fire the weapons inside the pockets. In 1858 he was challenged to a duel by a fellow Judge (William T. Barbour) but at the dueling ground, neither man fired his gun.

In 1859 Field replaced the former chief justice of the California Supreme Court, David S. Terry, because Judge Terry killed a United States Senator from California (David Colbreth Broderick) in a duel and left the state. Field and Terry&#x27;s paths crossed again 30 years later when Field, acting in his capacity as a circuit judge of the 9th Federal Circuit Court, ruled against Terry in a convoluted divorce case (and had him sent to jail for contempt of court as well). Seeking revenge, Terry attempted to kill Field in 1889 near Stockton, California, but was instead shot dead by Field&#x27;s bodyguard, U.S. Marshal David B. Neagle. Legal issues arising from the killing of Terry came before the Supreme Court in the 1890 habeas corpus case of &quot;In re Neagle&quot;. The Court ruled the United States Attorney General had authority to appoint U.S. Marshals as bodyguards to Supreme Court justices and Marshal Neagle had acted within the scope of his authority in shooting Terry. Field recused himself from the case.

==U.S. Supreme Court justice==

The number of seats on the United States Supreme Court was expanded from nine to ten in March 1863, as a result of the Tenth Circuit Act. This gave President Abraham Lincoln an opportunity to nominate a new associate justice, which he did on March 6, 1863. Seeking to effect both a regional and political balance on the Court, Lincoln selected Field, a westerner and Unionist Democrat. Field was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 1863, and took the judicial oath of office on May 20, 1863.

Field insisted on breaking John Marshall&#x27;s record of 34 years on the court, even when he was no longer able to handle the workload. His colleagues asked him to resign due to him being intermittently senile, but he refused, at one point John Marshall Harlan urged Field to retire, reminding Field that he had been part of a committee to urge Justice Robert Grier to retire. Finding Field dozing in the robing room, Harlan later related what happened next: “The old man listened, gradually became alert, and finally, with his eyes blazing with the fire of youth, he burst out, ‘Yes, and a dirtier day’s work I never did in my life.&#x27;”

In March 1896, he wrote what would be his final opinion on behalf of the Court, but remained on the bench for another twenty months, finally retiring on December 1, 1897. Field would become the last veteran of both the Taney Court and the Chase Court to remain on the bench. He would remain the longest serving member of the Court until his record was surpassed by William O. Douglas, who served from 1939 to 1975.

He died in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1899, and was buried there in the Rock Creek Cemetery.

===Jurisprudence===
Field wrote 544 opinions, more than any other justice save for Samuel Miller, John P. Stevens, and Clarence Thomas (by comparison, Chief Justice Marshall wrote 508 opinions in his 34 years on the court). According to journalist Brian Doherty, &quot;Field was one of the pioneers of the concept (beloved by many libertarian legal thinkers) of substantive due process – the notion that the due process protected by the Fourteenth Amendment applied not merely to procedures but to the substance of laws as well.&quot; Field&#x27;s vocal advocacy of substantive due process was illustrated in his dissents to the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; and &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot;. In the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot;, Justice Field&#x27;s dissent focused on the Privileges or Immunities clause, not the Due Process clause (which was important in the dissent of Justice Bradley as well as the dissent of Justice Swayne). In both &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; and &quot;Mugler v. Kansas&quot;, Justice Field based his dissent on the protection of property interests by the Due Process clause. One of Field&#x27;s most notable opinions was his majority opinion in &quot;Pennoyer v. Neff&quot;, which set the standard on personal jurisdiction for the next 100 years. His views on due process were eventually adopted by the court&#x27;s majority after he left the Supreme Court. In other cases he helped end the income tax (&quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan and Trust Company&quot;), limited antitrust law (&quot;United States v. E.C. Knight Company&quot;), and limited the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also joined the majority in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; that upheld racial segregation. Field dissented in the landmark case &quot;Strauder v. West Virginia&quot;, where the majority opinion held that the exclusion of African-Americans from juries violated the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause.
Early in his career, Field wrote opinions against California&#x27;s laws discriminating against the Chinese immigrants to that state. Serving as an individual jurist in district court, he notably struck down the so-called &#x27;Pigtail Ordinance&#x27; in 1879, which was regarded as discriminating against Chinese, making him unpopular with the Californian public. In his 1884 district court ruling, &quot;In re Look Tin Sing&quot;, he declared that children born in U.S. jurisdictions are U.S. citizens regardless of ancestry. However, as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court, he penned opinions infused with racist anti-Chinese-American rhetoric, most notably in his majority opinion in &quot;The Chinese Exclusion Case, Chae Chan Ping v. United States,&quot; 130 U.S. 581 (1889), and in his dissent in &quot;Chew Heong v. United States&quot;, 112 U.S. 536 (1884).

===Academic work===
In November 1885, Field served as an original trustee of Leland Stanford Junior University.

<doc id="912056" wikidata="Q157379" url="?curid=912056" title="Mahonia">
<text>Mahonia is a formerly accepted genus of approximately 70 species of shrubs or, rarely, small trees with evergreen leaves in the family Berberidaceae, native to eastern Asia, the Himalaya, North America, and Central America. They are closely related to the genus &quot;Berberis&quot; and as of 2023 the majority of botanical sources list it as a synonym for &quot;Berberis.&quot;

However, there is still disagreement among botanists, and as recently as 2017 papers have been published arguing for the validity of the genus. In addition, sources that are updated less frequently like the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service PLANTS database have many plants listed in &quot;Mahonia&quot;.

Most botanists prefer to classify &quot;Mahonia&quot; as a part of &quot;Berberis&quot; because several species in both genera are able to hybridize, and because there are no consistent morphological differences between the two groups other than the leaf pinnation (&quot;Berberis sensu stricto&quot; appear to have simple leaves, but these are in reality compound with a single leaflet and are termed &quot;unifoliolate&quot;; additionally their branched spines are modified compound leaves). However, recent DNA-based phylogenetic studies retain the two separate genera, by clarifying that unifoliolate-leaved &quot;Berberis s.s.&quot; is derived from within a paraphyletic group of shrubs bearing imparipinnate evergreen leaves, which are then divided into three genera: &quot;Mahonia&quot;, &quot;Alloberberis&quot; (formerly &quot;Mahonia&quot; section &quot;Horridae&quot;), and &quot;Moranothamnus&quot; (formerly &quot;Berberis claireae&quot;); a broadly-circumscribed &quot;Berberis&quot; (that is, including &quot;Mahonia&quot;, &quot;Alloberberis&quot;, and &quot;Moranothamnus&quot;) would also be monophyletic.

&quot;Mahonia&quot; species bear pinnate leaves long with 3 to 15 leaflets, and flowers in racemes which are long. Several species are popular garden shrubs, grown for their ornamental, often spiny, evergreen foliage, yellow (or rarely red) flowers in autumn, winter and early spring, and blue-black berries. The flowers are borne in terminal clusters or spreading racemes, and may be among the earliest flowers to appear in the growing season. The ripened fruits are acidic with a very sharp flavor. The plants contain berberine, a compound found in many &quot;Berberis&quot; and &quot;Mahonia&quot; species which causes vomiting, lowered blood pressure, reduced heart rate, lethargy, and other ill effects when consumed.

The genus name, &quot;Mahonia&quot;, derives from Bernard McMahon, one of the stewards of the plant collections from the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The type species of the genus is &quot;M. aquifolium&quot;.

<doc id="912057" wikidata="Q141297" url="?curid=912057" title="Portugal at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Portugal competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Portuguese athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era since 1912. The Olympic Committee of Portugal sent the nation&#x27;s second-largest team to the Games. A total of 81 athletes, 64 men and 17 women, were selected by the committee to participate in 15 sports. Men&#x27;s football was the only team-based sport in which Portugal had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in badminton, canoeing, equestrian, artistic and trampoline gymnastics, triathlon, and wrestling, which made its official Olympic comeback after an eight-year absence.

Twenty-four Portuguese athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including two returning Olympic medalists: long-distance runner and former champion Fernanda Ribeiro and lightweight judoka Nuno Delgado, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Mistral windsurfer and multiple-time European champion João Rodrigues and middle-distance runner Carla Sacramento shared their experiences at these Games as the only athletes who made their fourth Olympic appearance. Equestrian rider Carlos Grave, aged 46, was the oldest athlete of the team, while breaststroke swimmer Diana Gomes was the youngest at age 15. Among the Portuguese athletes on the team, two of them had acquired dual citizenship to compete for Portugal: former hurdler Naide Gomes from São Tomé and Príncipe in the women&#x27;s heptathlon, and sprinter Francis Obikwelu on his third Olympic bid after he previously joined the Nigerian squad in Atlanta and Sydney.

Portugal left Athens with only three Olympic medals, two silver and one bronze, improving the nation&#x27;s stark medal tally from Sydney four years earlier. The highlight of the Games for the Portuguese team came on the first day with a historic milestone for Sérgio Paulinho, as the nation&#x27;s first-ever cyclist to claim a silver medal in the men&#x27;s road race. The remaining medals were awarded to the athletes in the track and field. On August 22, 2004, Obikwelu challenged the Americans in the men&#x27;s 100 metres, but he managed to settle only for the silver. Meanwhile, Rui Silva added another medal for Portugal with a blistering bronze in the men&#x27;s 1500 metres, which was dominated by Morocco&#x27;s Hicham El Guerrouj.

<text>The Latter Rain, also known as the New Order or the New Order of the Latter Rain, was a post-World War II movement within Pentecostal Christianity which remains controversial. The movement saw itself as a continuation of the restorationism of early Pentecostalism. The movement began with major revivals between 1948 and 1952 and became established as a large semi-organized movement by 1952. It continued into the 1960s. The movement had a profound impact on subsequent movements as its participants dispersed throughout the broader Charismatic and Pentecostal movements beginning in the 1960s.

The Latter Rain Movement had its beginnings in the years following World War II and was contemporary with the evangelical awakening led by Billy Graham, as well as with the Healing Revival of Oral Roberts, Jack Coe, and William Branham. In the fall of 1947, several leaders of the small Pentecostal Sharon Orphanage and Schools in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, were inspired to begin a period of intense fasting and prayer for &quot;outpourings of the Holy Spirit&quot; after visiting one of Branham&#x27;s healing campaigns in Vancouver, Canada. After weeks of fasting and prayer, the participants had ecstatic experiences and reported miracles. Later that year, groups organized large revival events, and news quickly swept across Canada and the United States, influencing many Pentecostal believers. The movement was deeply influenced by British Israelism and many of the movement&#x27;s doctrines, including their interpretation of the &quot;Latter Rain&quot; prophecy, were based on parallels drawn between the church and Israel based on British Israel ideology.

Joseph Mattsson-Boze was an important leader of the movement and helped organize many revival conventions. He publicized the Latter Rain movement and its leaders in his &quot;Herald of Faith&quot; magazine in the 1950s and 1960s. Boze was instrumental in bringing the Independent Assemblies of God in the revival. The IAoG were key supporters of the Latter Rain movement and provided an early framework for the movement which emphasized the independence of the local church and opposed complex denominational structures. As the revival died down after a few years, those who had been swayed by the doctrine formed various loosely affiliated groups. William Branham, Ern Baxter, Sam Fife, John Robert Stevens, Paul Cain, Emanuele Cannistraci, Dick Iverson, Kevin Conner, Dick Benjamin, Leonard Fox, Violet Kitely, Reg Lazelle, David Schoch, George Evans, Charlotte Baker, Fuchsia Pickett, Jim Watt and others, were prominent ministries that influenced and were influenced by the Latter Rain.

The Latter Rain strongly emphasized relational networks over denominational structures. Latter Rain emphases are some of the most noticeable differences between Pentecostals and Charismatics, as delineated, for example, by the Assemblies of God USA in their 2000 position paper on end time revival. The Latter Rain movement was rejected by classical Pentecostal denominations. The broader Pentecostal movement began to strongly reject elements of the Latter Rain movement starting in the early 1950s, which caused significant discord and confrontations between participants in the Latter Rain and the leadership of older Pentecostal groups. The term &quot;Latter Rain&quot; increasingly became a pejorative label among the broader Pentecostal movement; therefore, many ministers who were influenced by the movement became reluctant to share their connections to the movement. Much of the movement, along with elements of the Healing Revival, integrated into parts of the larger Charismatic movement.

==History==

===Background===
The late 1940s was a time Pentecostals considered &quot;of deep spiritual hunger,&quot; as they were concerned about the declining operation of the gifts of the Spirit they claimed were once so evident when Pentecostalism began in the early 20th century. In response, about 70 students gathered in October 1947 in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, to begin the first term of the newly formed Sharon Bible College. Most were first-year students, but some were second and third-year students from the Pentecostal Bible College in Saskatoon.

From the latter part of October 1947 until February 1948, members of the school participated in daily fasting and prayer. Classes were suspended at times to encourage the movement which the majority of the school began to participate in. The students believed that God was about to do something new and unique for the church. Some students issued prophecies that urged others &quot;to seek the face of the Lord&quot;. Some students reporting difficulty studying because of their intense motivation to pray and fast.

By day, the students labored to construct buildings to serve as new classrooms and gathered for prayer in the evenings, which included intercessory prayer, prophecy and fasting. Some fasted between three and forty days. At the time, the school consisted of three buildings at the North Battleford airport.

The group was led primarily by George Hawtin and Percy G. Hunt, two former pastors of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, and Herrick Holt, a pastor of the Church of the Foursquare Gospel in North Battleford. They were later joined by George Hawtin&#x27;s brother Ernest Hawtin, and brother-in-law Milford Kirkpatrick. The initial 70 Sharon School students had followed Hawtin and Hunt from Bethel Bible Institute in Saskatoon, where both had formerly taught. Hawtin had been asked to resign for lack of cooperation with the institute, and Hunt resigned in sympathy.

=== Initial revival (1948) ===

On February 11, 1948, a young woman prophesied &quot;that we are on the very verge of a great revival, and all we have to do is open the door, and we could enter in.&quot; After the prophecy Pastor Hawtin prayed, &quot;Father we do not know where the door is, neither do we know how to enter it.&quot;

A following prophecy described the open door as the doorway into the gifts and ministries in the Body of Christ. Then, the following day, the students began to have ecstatic experiences which were described as &quot;the rain pouring down&quot;. One of the eyewitnesses, Ern Hawtin, brother of Pastor George Hawtin, reported the outpouring as the revival suddenly began in the largest classroom where the entire student body was gathered. One student claimed to experience a vision. Other students claimed they were under the power of God as they collapsed on the floor.

Some students knelt in worship and reported feeling in &quot;deep awe of God&quot;. One claimed to be directed by God to lay his hands upon a student and pray for him. After doing so, he uttered a prophecy to the student. Then another lengthy prophecy was given by Ern Hawtin that the gifts of the spirit will be restored to the church to be received by prophecy and the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Haltingly, the members of the school began to pray and lay hands on people, and there were reports of multiple healings as result of the prayers. Prior to this, the laying on of hands for this purpose was viewed as heretical and had not been practiced for several decades throughout Pentecostalism. Pastor G. Hawtin came to believe that the nine spiritual gifts had been restored to the Church.

Thomas Holdcroft wrote about the events:
In the spring of 1948 on Easter weekend, special services were held which the school called the &quot;Feast of Pentecost&quot;. Many people who had heard of the revivals in North Battleford attended these services. This led to what is considered the first &quot;Camp Meeting&quot; during July 7–18, 1948, which began drawing large crowds in the thousands.

The revival quickly spread across the country and the world and was joined by numerous churches and individuals. Glad Tidings Temple in Vancouver, British Columbia, became an important church that spread the message of revival around the world through her publications, tapes and missionaries worldwide and Bible schools in Vancouver, Taiwan, Mexico, the Arctic and in Uganda. The Philadelphia Church in Chicago became another important hub of the Latter Rain revival. Its pastor, Joseph Mattsson-Boze was a leading figure in the Independent Assemblies of God, whose denomination embraced the movement early on. &quot;Herald of Faith&quot; magazine began to print and publicize the events of the revival. Bethseda Missionary Temple in Detroit began interacting with the movement in December 1949 and became another important bastion of the movement. Franklin Hall, who published &quot;Miracle Word&quot; magazine, began participating in the movement in 1948.

===Israel and the church===
The Latter Rain movement was deeply influenced by British Israelism which impacted the development of some of the key teachings of the movement. The teachings from the revival came to be known as &quot;Latter Rain&quot; because its leaders began to connect the timing of the revival with the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948. They believed their revival was a fulfillment of a prophecy of a coming &quot;latter rain&quot; by Joel the Prophet. The Latter Rain movement believes that the Church is the spiritual counterpart of Israel. They believe parallels exist between the history of Israel and the Church such that whenever Israel experiences restorative events, the Church similarly experiences a spiritual restoration.

In 1900, when the Zionist movement was seeking a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine, it coincided with &quot;a restoration of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit&quot; at the Azusa Street Revival in 1906. In 1948 when the modern nation of Israel was established, they claim God restored the doctrine of the laying on of hands and praise through the Latter Rain Revival and raised up healing evangelists such as Branham and Oral Roberts. This teaching was widely promoted by Branham, Hawtin, Mattson-Boze, Ern Baxter, and many other prominent figures connected to the movement. In 1967, Israel won the Six-Day War and restored Jewish control over Jerusalem. The Latter Rain movement connected the event with the charismatic movement which it said was restoring the gifts of the spirit to the church. Groups influenced by and descended from Latter Rain have continued the pattern of connecting what they believe to be restoration events in church to restoration events for the nation of Israel.

George Warnock, a former personal secretary to Ern Baxter (an associate with William Branham&#x27;s healing ministry), resided at Sharon Schools in the fall of 1949 and performed various work supporting the movement. Branham and Baxter both adopted many of the teachings that developed within the Latter Rain movement. Warnock&#x27;s book, &quot;The Feast of Tabernacles&quot; (1951), discussed the role of Sharon Schools and affiliated groups in living out the completion of God&#x27;s feasts for Israel, through perfection of the saints and their dominion over the earth. He described the Jewish feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles as ones that &quot;pre-figure and typify the whole Church Age, beginning with the death of Jesus on the cross, and consummating in &quot;the manifestation of the Sons of God&quot; – the &quot;overcomers&quot; who will step into immortality and establish the Kingdom of God on earth.&quot;

=== Reaction from Pentecostal leaders ===

Some Pentecostal denominational leadership began to openly oppose the revival in the spring of 1948, and questioned the teachings and practices being developed by the movement. As the revival progressed, their condemnations became more pronounced. According to one author, &quot;leaders of the Assemblies of God watched in horror&quot; as the Latter Rain movement began to grant ministering licenses to unqualified preachers and viewed some of their teachings as divisive and harmful. For instance, the 1949 General Council of the Assemblies of God USA declared in its Resolution #7:
Bill Britton wrote that
During the early years, some of the most ardent critics of the Latter Rain and its theology came from within Pentecostalism, particularly the Assemblies of God. In 1949, the General Council of the Assemblies of God, following the leadership of its General Superintendent E. S. Williams, stated that pre-tribulation rapture represented correct eschatology. It rejected the Latter Rain practice of personal prophecy accompanied by the laying on of hands, as well as the Manifest Sons of God doctrine.

The Latter Rain strongly emphasized relational networks over organizational structure. Latter Rain emphases are some of the most noticeable differences between Pentecostals and Charismatics, as delineated, for example, by the Assemblies of God in their 2000 position paper on End Time Revival. The Latter Rain movement was rejected by classical Pentecostal denominations. The broader Pentecostal movement began to strongly reject elements of the Latter Rain movement starting by the early 1950s, which caused significant discord and confrontations between followers of Latter Rain and the older Pentecostal groups. The term &quot;Latter Rain&quot; increasingly became a pejorative label among the broader Pentecostal movement.

The movement widely influenced many prominent ministries. Some branches of the movement developed as cult-like groups, such Sam Fife and The Move, William Branham and The Message, and John Robert Stevens and The Walk. Other parts of the movement moderated the doctrine and ultimately had a widespread influence on the Charismatic and Pentecostal churches at large.

The Latter Rain movement ultimately led to major divisions within the Pentecostal denominations, especially the Assemblies of God. Stanley Frodsham, a noted Assemblies of God leader, left the Assemblies in favor of the Latter Rain. He noted that it had practices and experiences similar to the Azusa Street Revival, a founding element of the Pentecostal Church. The opposition of other Pentecostal denominations ultimately led to the withdrawal, under pressure, of Ivan Q. Spencer, founder of the Elim Fellowship, from inter-Pentecostal fellowship.

Contemporary criticism of the Latter Rain movement has emanated from fundamentalists such as John MacArthur, as demonstrated by their websites that attack the movement. Some identify the roots of more recent Charismatic trends such as Kingdom Now theology, the Kansas City Prophets including Paul Cain, and the New Apostolic Reformation including C. Peter Wagner as being rooted in the Latter Rain. The modern charismatic movement, while clearly influenced by some Latter Rain ideals such as the fivefold ministry and the laying on of hands, generally rejects the more extreme elements of Latter Rain theology, although even many charismatics argue that the New Apostolic Reformation wing of the movement are more heavily influenced by this theology.

A small, controversial branch of the Latter Rain is the &quot;Reconciliation&quot; movement, especially those who believe in &quot;Manifest Sonship&quot; theology. Reconciliation (also called ultimate or universal reconciliation) is a doctrine of Christian Universalism that acknowledges God&#x27;s plan to save the whole world through the atoning sacrifice of Christ. According to this tradition, the manifest Sons of God are expected to reign on earth during a coming millennial age until ultimately every human being will be restored to harmony with God.

==Beliefs==
Latter Rain proponents viewed themselves as a continuation of classical Pentecostalism and continued many Pentecostal teachings and practices. Latter Rain leaders viewed Pentecostalism as spiritually dry in the post-war period and in danger of slipping into a dry or mental formalism like many of their evangelical peers. Latter Rain leaders developed new doctrines and practices to address the developing formalism with Pentecostalism. These changes made the Latter Rain Movement distinct from the classical Pentecostals. The Latter Rain influenced a new style of leadership structure, worship, and a different doctrinal emphasis that was significantly different from traditional Pentecostalism.

The Latter Rain brought a new focus on the spiritual elements of Christianity, including personal prophecy, typological interpretation of Scripture, the restoration of the five-fold ministry, and a different eschatological emphasis. George Warnock&#x27;s &quot;Feast of Tabernacles&quot; outlined some of these emphases, and is widely quoted as an early distillation of the teachings.

&quot;Leaders of the movement taught that the Christian Church must restore and equip a “five-fold ministry” which included modern-day apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Then, while appointing key individuals to these roles, the movement presented the idea that mainstream Christianity had become apostate and needed purging.&quot;

===Eschatology===
The Latter Rain broke with the historic dispensationalism which had become entrenched in the ranks of Pentecostalism, which they believed tended to be pessimistic and apocalyptic in its outlook. The Latter Rain emphasized a victorious eschatological outlook. Rather than attempting to save a few souls before the rise of the anti-Christ, the Latter Rain emphasized the Church as overcoming and victorious, relating that it would come into &quot;full stature&quot; as taught by the Apostle Paul.

The term &quot;Latter Rain&quot; stems from Bible passages such as Jeremiah 3:3, 5:23–25, Joel 2:23, Hosea 6:3, Zechariah 10:1, and James 5:7. The idea of a latter rain was not new to Pentecostals. It was present from the earliest days of Pentecostalism, which believed that the reappearance of speaking in tongues and the baptism of the Holy Spirit marked the &quot;latter rain of God&#x27;s Spirit.&quot; It was believed that these were signs of the coming end of history. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost had been the &quot;former rain&quot; that established the Church, but the current &quot;move&quot; of the Spirit was the latter rain that would bring the Church&#x27;s work to completion and culminate in the imminent Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

===Manifested Sons of God and Joel&#x27;s Army===
A major feature of Latter Rain teaching focused on the &quot;manifestation of the Sons of God&quot; or &quot;Joel&#x27;s Army&quot;. The Latter Rain movement leaders taught that as the end of the age approached, the manifested sons of God would appear in the church. They would be empowered with supernatural gifts and able to perform miracles comparable to the miracles ascribed to Jesus Christ in the New Testament. These Manifest Sons of God, ones who have come into the full stature of Jesus Christ, would receive the Spirit without measure.

The basic premise of the teaching developed shortly after the initial revival, and the teaching evolved rapidly and in alternate ways among the different groups participating in the movement. The various branches of the movement debated the nature and extent of this . Some branches believed only a limited number would achieve this status, but others believed all participants in the revival could experience it. In most groups, the focus on obtaining the &quot;stature of Christ&quot; quickly became a key teaching of the movement, but the groups varied widely in defining just what the &quot;stature of Christ&quot; entailed.

Some branches of the movement, believed they would be as Jesus was when he was on earth and would receive a number of divine gifts, including the ability to change their physical location, to speak any language through the Holy Spirit, and to perform divine healings and other miracles. Thus empowered, they would complete the work of God, restoring man&#x27;s rightful position as was originally mandated in Genesis. By coming into the full stature of Christ, they would use their newfound powers to usher in his millennial reign through the creation of a theocratic system of government. Extreme versions of this interpretation referred to Jesus as a &quot;pattern&quot; Son, and believed that believers would become identical to Jesus in every way. They applied the &quot;ye are gods&quot; passage (Psalms 82:6) to validate their belief.

The manifested sons theology is also deeply connected with Fivefold ministry thinking, and played an important role in shaping the way these teachings were viewed by subsequent movements. Early leaders used Ephesians 4 to develop the idea that the manifestation of the sons of God could only be achieved through the leadership of specially endowed preachers operating as a &quot;five-fold&quot; ministry. In practice, this led to the creation of a strongly authoritarian leadership structure where members were required to submit themselves to the direction of their leaders for life guidance, decision making, and discipline. The five-fold ministry views featured especially strongly in the Shepherding Movement, which transmitted the concepts into the Charismatic Movement.

Dominion Theology emerged from manifested sons of God concepts and has been described in the 21st century as a &quot;rapidly growing apocalyptic movement,&quot; prophesied to become an &quot;Armageddon-ready military force of young people who will love not their life unto death, who will stand face to face with the incarnation of satan as the antichrist and his army in the end of the age.&quot;

===Ecclesiology===
The &quot;Sacrifice of Praise&quot; and the restoration of the Tabernacle of David were important themes within the Latter Rain. Dancing, lifting of hands and spontaneous praise are marks of this movement. An effort was made to show the error of many Christians who denied that such practices were imperative for believers.

A major theme of the Latter Rain was &quot;unity&quot; among the believers in the church service, the geographic region, and at large. The unity beliefs began to develop after the mainstream Pentecostal denominations began to reject their movement and take steps to distance themselves from the Latter Rain teachings and practices. Blaming the denominations for stopping what they perceived to be a move of God, Latter Rain proponents began to strongly condemn and reject denomination structures as incompatible with unity. They taught that God saw the Church organized not into denominations but along geographical lines, as in the book of Acts—one Church but in different locations. They expected that in the coming &quot;last days,&quot; the various Christian denominations would dissolve, and the true Church would coalesce into citywide churches under the leadership of the newly restored apostles and prophets.

The Latter Rain taught that there would be a restoration of the five ministerial roles mentioned in Ephesians 4:11: apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. They believed that the foundational roles of apostle and prophet had been lost after the time of the first apostles due to the Dark Ages. They thought that God was restoring these ministries in the present day. These ideas are part of the &quot;prophetic movement&quot; and &quot;New Apostolic Reformation&quot;.

Belief in the restoration of the offices of apostle and prophet distinguished the Latter Rain Movement from the rest of Pentecostalism. Classical Pentecostals viewed the five ministerial roles as functions and gifts vested in the entire Spirit-baptized congregation at large, subject to the leading of the Spirit, and not gifts which operated solely at the discretion of one gifted individual.

===Pneumatology===
Pentecostals traditionally held that the baptism of the Holy Spirit usually comes after prolonged &quot;tarrying&quot; or waiting for the Spirit. By contrast, the Latter Rain movement taught that the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gifts can be imparted from one believer to another through the laying on of hands.

A participant in services at Bethesda Missionary Temple in Detroit, Michigan described the discerning of gifts:
==Leaders==

The following list includes some representative leaders of various branches, both past and present; it is not exhaustive.

===Founders===
*Maria Fraser founded the Latter Rain Mission in South Africa (Blourokkies) as a secession of the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa 1927/1928, but this is generally considered a different movement from what developed in North America.
*Reg Layzell founded Glad Tidings church in Vancouver, British Columbia; he is an author and influenced such books as &quot;The Key of David&quot; and &quot;Unto Perfection&quot;.
*George Warnock wrote &quot;The Feast of Tabernacles&quot; (1951) which became very influential for its view of the biblical feasts and approach to the Scriptures. One identifiable mark of those influenced by the Latter Rain is their spiritual hermeneutic.
*George Hawtin and his brother Ern Hawtin were early leaders and evangelists in the movement, who traveled to spread the word.
*A. Earl Lee was one of the fathers of the movement in southern California. He had previously been involved with the preacher Aimee Semple McPherson.
*Myrtle D. Beall was the founder and Senior Pastor of Bethesda Missionary Temple in Detroit, Michigan until her death in 1979.
*J. Preston Eby was an early proponent; he resigned under pressure from the Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1956 because his Latter Rain beliefs were not approved by the church.
*Thomas Wyatt, a pastor from Portland, Oregon, hosted the North Battleford men at a pastor&#x27;s conference, thus enabling the spread of the doctrine.
*Garlon and Modest Pemberton were the pastors of a significant Latter Rain church in Houston.
*Charles E. Green founded Word of Faith Temple in New Orleans, Louisiana, which grew to over a thousand members. The church is still in existence today, and is known as Life Gate Church. Charles Green&#x27;s son, Michael, pastors Life Gate Church.

===Ministers Fellowship International=== 
Ministers Fellowship International (MFI) is the most prominent direct descendant of the Latter Rain movement and one that is considered mainstream in theology. It founded Portland Bible College in Portland, Oregon, which is a leading institution in the Latter Rain tradition. Many of the books used by Latter Rain churches are textbooks created for Portland Bible College and written by its original teachers. These books include &quot;Present Day Truths&quot; by Dick Iverson and many by Kevin Conner. City Bible Publishing carries many contemporary books that define the movement. Kevin Conner&#x27;s &quot;Tabernacle of David&quot; and &quot;Present Day Truths&quot; are classics on worship and restoration.

MFI&#x27;s leadership includes many significant figures from the early years of the movement.
*Dick Iverson, founder of Mannahouse Church, (formerly Bible Temple and City Bible Church), and Portland Bible College, was the apostolic overseer of Ministers Fellowship International. That position is now held by Frank Damazio. The Pastor of Mannahouse Church is currently Marc Estes.
*Kevin Conner, an influential Bible teacher in the Latter Rain; he blended some of the new ideas with more traditional hermeneutics. He influenced T. D. Jakes and other ministers.
*David Schoch was associated with this branch of the Latter Rain and was an honorary member of the apostolic board of MFI until his death in July 2007. The church he led is now known as City At the Cross in Long Beach, California.
*Violet Kiteley founded Shiloh Christian Fellowship in Oakland, California. David Kiteley, was co-founder of Shiloh, and is now Pastor Emeritus and an original member of the MFI leadership. Melinda Ramos and Javier Ramos, David&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law are pastors of Shiloh Church and members of the MFI leadership team.

===Others===
*Bishop Bill Hamon of Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, has been influential in the Charismatic movement. Hamon&#x27;s book &quot;The Eternal Church&quot; outlines the movement, noting his presence.
*Dr. Philip Wiley, of Rustburg, Virginia, Bread of Life Ministries International, School of the Bible, reflects the teachings of George Warnock&#x27;s Feast of Tabernacles.
*Dr. Kelley Varner (1949–2009) of Richlands, North Carolina, had a teaching ministry influenced by the Latter Rain, which he acknowledged in his books.
*John Gavazzoni, Kenneth Greatorex, Gary Sigler and Robert Torango are charismatic Christians who teach universal reconciliation and sonship (a version of the ancient Christian doctrines of apocatastasis and theosis). Gavazzoni and Greatorex are leaders of Greater Emmanuel International Ministries. Sigler runs a large website called Kingdom Resources. Torango leads a church and evangelistic ministry in Tennessee.
*Tony Salmon, of West Virginia, is founder and vice president of Kingdom Ministries. Salmon has been an active proponent of and spokesman for the teachings of sonship and reconciliation.
*Charles Schmitt, pastor of Immanuel&#x27;s Church in Silver Spring, Maryland, and founder of the Body of Christ movement, spent time in the Latter Rain.
*Bill Britton is an author and teacher on sonship.
*Paul N. Grubb and his wife, Lura, of Faith Temple in Memphis, Tennessee, were also sonship proponents.
*Wade Taylor co-founder (along with Bill Britton) of Pinecrest Bible Training Center in Salisbury Center, New York.
*Robin McMillan, a former pastor of the lead fellowship of Rick Joyner&#x27;s MorningStar Ministries, was mentored by Wade Taylor. MorningStar itself is very reflective of a Latter Rain ideal.
*Glenn Ewing and his son, Robert Ewing, of Waco, Texas, trained Jim Laffoon, leading prophet for Every Nations.

===Other movements and institutions===
*Elim Fellowship and its college, Elim Bible Institute in New York, were the focus of much Latter Rain activity.
*Destiny Image Publications, founded by Don Nori, who was a prophet in a Latter Rain church before founding the publishing house. The company prints titles by Varner, Joyner, Hamon and others.
*The Independent Assemblies of God, International, organized by A. W. Rasmussen.

<text>Ivar Aasen-sambandet (The Ivar Aasen Union) is an umbrella organization of associations and individuals promoting the use of the Høgnorsk variant of the Norwegian language.

== History ==
The union was founded in 1965 as a response to the &quot;samnorsk&quot; policy (aiming to merge the two languages Nynorsk and Bokmål) prevailing with Noregs Mållag (Norwegian Language Union). 

In 2002, Norway officially abandoned the samnorsk policy, like the majority of Noregs Mållag did during the 1990s. This decade also saw the revitalization of the Høgnorsk movement, which took place inside of &quot;Noregs Mållag&quot; as well. The split between the two movements was now only organizational, and the Høgnorsk movement no longer looked upon the other part as an enemy; however, it maintained that it had &quot;a certain task&quot; in the common works on the Norwegian language.

<text>Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira (born December 13, 1944), more famous under his pen name Léo is a Brazilian comics creator.

==Biography==
After graduating as a mechanical engineer, Oliveira left Brazil because of the then military dictatorship. He lived in Chile until the Chilean coup of 1973, then in Argentina, before returning to Brazil in 1974. He worked as an illustrator in the advertising industry in São Paulo before once more leaving Brazil, this time for France, in 1981. He had hoped to find work illustrating comics, but the Franco-Belgian comics industry was in difficulty at the time so he fell back on advertising once again, with a few comics pieces being published in L&#x27;Écho des savanes and Pilote.

In 1986, with the assistance of Jean-Claude Forest, Oliveira began contributing to the youth oriented magazines of Bayard Presse. He illustrated true stories for magazine. He then recounted Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s life in the album &quot;Gandhi, le pèlerin de la paix&quot;, for . In 1988, he began illustrating the stories of the comics writer . The collaboration proved fruitful, producing eight albums in the series &quot;Trent&quot; and five of another series, &quot;Kenya&quot;.

In 1993, Oliveira finally achieved a dream when Dargaud agreed to publish his first solo (writer-artist) series: &quot;Aldébaran&quot;. This story has continued in the sequel series &quot;Bételgeuse&quot; and &quot;Antarès&quot;, the former nominated for the Prize for a Series at the Angoulême International Comics Festival in 2004.

<doc id="912076" wikidata="Q3234345" url="?curid=912076" title="Cajal body">
<text>Cajal bodies (CBs), also coiled bodies, are spherical nuclear bodies of 0.3–1.0 μm in diameter found in the nucleus of proliferative cells like embryonic cells and tumor cells, or metabolically active cells like neurons. CBs are membrane-less organelles and largely consist of proteins and RNA. They were first reported by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in 1903, who called them &quot;nucleolar accessory bodies&quot; due to their association with the nucleoli in neuronal cells. They were rediscovered with the use of the electron microscope (EM) and named &quot;coiled bodies&quot;, according to their appearance as coiled threads on EM images, and later renamed after their discoverer. Research on CBs was accelerated after discovery and cloning of the marker protein p80/Coilin. CBs have been implicated in RNA-related metabolic processes such as the biogenesis, maturation and recycling of snRNPs, histone mRNA processing and telomere maintenance. CBs assemble RNA which is used by telomerase to add nucleotides to the ends of telomeres.

==History==
CBs were initially discovered by neurobiologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal in 1903 as small (readily stained by silver salts, literally &quot;silver loving&quot;) spots in the nuclei of silver-stained neuronal cells. Because of their close association with nucleoli, he named them &quot;nucleolar accessory bodies&quot;. Later on, they were forgotten and rediscovered multiple times independently which led to a state where scientists from different research fields used different names for the same structure. Names used for CBs included &quot;sphere organelles&quot;, &quot;Binnenkörper&quot;, &quot;nucleolar bodies&quot; or &quot;coiled bodies&quot;. The name coiled bodies comes from observation of electron microscopists Monneron and Bernhard. They described bodies as aggregates composed of coiled threads with thickness of 400–600 Å. When using higher magnification, they appear as tiny, 50 Å thick fibrils irregularly twisted along the axis of the threads. The bodies were even predicted to consist of ribonucleoproteins since treatment of cells with protease and RNase together, but not alone, caused dramatic changes to the structure of CBs.

==Localization==
Cajal bodies are found in all eukaryotes that have been carefully studied.
The cells in which Cajal bodies are most apparent usually demonstrate high levels of transcriptional activity, and are often dividing rapidly.

==Cell cycle==
They are about 0.1–2.0 micrometres and are found one to five per nucleus. The number varies in different types of cells and over the cell cycle. Maximum number is reached in mid G1 phase and towards G2 they become larger and their number decreases. CBs disassemble during the M phase and reappear again later in G1 phase. Cajal bodies are possibly sites of assembly or modification of the transcription machinery of the nucleus.

==Functions==
CBs are bound to the nucleolus by coilin proteins. P80-coilin is a specific marker for coiled bodies, and demonstrates these bodies tend to be associated with the nucleolus when cells are not dividing. CBs are associated with telomerase assembly and recruitment via a CAB-RNA sequence common in both CB RNAs (scaRNAs) and the RNA component of telomerase (TERC). TCAB1 recognizes the CAB sequence in both and recruits telomerase to the CBs. 

CBs contain high concentrations of splicing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), possibly indicating that they function to modify RNA after it has been transcribed from DNA. Experimental evidence indicates that CBs contribute to the biogenesis of enzyme telomerase, and assist in subsequent transport of telomerase to telomeres.

<text>William Marrion Branham (April 6, 1909 – December 24, 1965) was an American Christian minister and faith healer who initiated the post-World War II healing revival, and claimed to be a prophet with the anointing of Elijah, who had come to prelude Christ&#x27;s second coming; some of his followers have been labeled a &quot;doomsday cult&quot;. He is credited as &quot;a principal architect of restorationist thought&quot; for charismatics by some Christian historians, and has been called the &quot;leading individual in the Second Wave of Pentecostalism.&quot; He made a lasting influence on televangelism and the modern charismatic movement, and his &quot;stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement&quot;. At the time they were held, Branham&#x27;s inter-denominational meetings were the largest religious meetings ever held in some American cities. Branham was the first American deliverance minister to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.

Branham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set in motion the broader healing revival that later became the modern charismatic movement. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and &quot;the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation&quot;. From 1955, Branham&#x27;s campaigning and popularity began to decline as the Pentecostal churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.

Unlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the Full Gospel tradition, Branham developed an alternative theology which was primarily a mixture of Calvinist and Arminian doctrines, and had a heavy focus on dispensationalism and Branham&#x27;s own unique eschatological views. While widely accepting the restoration doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as &quot;revelatory madness&quot;. His racial teachings on serpent seed and his belief that membership in a Christian denomination was connected to the mark of the beast alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral scripture and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham&#x27;s objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a cult of personality during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
William M. Branham was born near Burkesville, Kentucky, on April 6, 1909, the son of Charles and Ella Harvey Branham, the oldest of ten children. He claimed that at his birth, a &quot;Light come whirling through the window, about the size of a pillow, and circled around where I was, and went down on the bed&quot;. Branham told his publicist Gordon Lindsay that he had mystical experiences from an early age; and that at age three he heard a &quot;voice&quot; speaking to him from a tree telling him &quot;he would live near a city called New Albany&quot;. According to Branham, that year his family moved to Jeffersonville, Indiana. Branham also said that when he was seven years old, God told him to avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages. Branham stated he never violated the command.

Branham told his audiences that he grew up in &quot;deep poverty&quot;, often not having adequate clothing, and that his family was involved in criminal activities. Branham&#x27;s neighbors reported him as &quot;someone who always seemed a little different&quot;, but said he was a dependable youth. Branham explained that his tendency towards &quot;mystical experiences and moral purity&quot; caused misunderstandings among his friends, family, and other young people; he was a &quot;black sheep&quot; from an early age. Branham called his childhood &quot;a terrible life.&quot;

Branham&#x27;s father owned a farm near Utica, Indiana, and took a job working for O. H. Wathen, owner of R. E. Wathen Distilleries in nearby Louisville, Kentucky. Wathen was a supplier for Al Capone&#x27;s bootlegging operations. Branham told his audiences that he was required to help his father with the illegal production and sale of liquor during prohibition. In March 1924, Branham&#x27;s father was arrested for his criminal activities; he was convicted and sentenced to a prison. The Indiana Ku Klux Klan claimed responsibility for attacking and shutting down the Jeffersonville liquor producing ring.

Branham was involved in a firearms incident and was shot in both legs in March 1924, at age 14; he later told his audiences he was involved in a hunting accident. Two of his brothers also suffered life-threatening injuries at the same time. Branham was rushed to the hospital for treatment. His family was unable to pay for his medical bills, but members of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan stepped in to cover the expenses. The help of the Klan during his impoverished childhood had a profound impact on Branham throughout his life. As late as 1963, Branham continued to speak highly of them saying, &quot;the Ku Klux Klan, paid the hospital bill for me, Masons. I can never forget them. See? No matter what they do, or what, I still ... there is something, and that stays with me ...&quot;. Branham would go on to maintain lifelong connections to the KKK.

===Conversion and early influences===
Branham told his audiences that he left home at age 19 in search of a better life, traveling to Phoenix, Arizona, where he worked on a ranch for two years and began a successful career in boxing. While Branham was away, his brother Edward aged 18, shot and killed a Jeffersonville man and was charged with murder. Edward died of a sudden illness only a short time later. Branham returned to Jeffersonville in June 1929 to attend the funeral. Branham had no experience with religion as a child; he said that the first time he heard a prayer was at his brother&#x27;s funeral.

Soon afterward, while he was working for the Public Service Company of Indiana, Branham was overcome by gas and had to be hospitalized. Branham said that he heard a voice speaking to him while he was recovering from the accident, which led him to begin seeking God. Shortly thereafter, he began attending the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville, where he converted to Christianity. The church was pastored by Roy Davis, a founding member of the second Ku Klux Klan and a leading recruiter for the organization. Davis later became the National Imperial Wizard (leader) of the KKK. Davis baptized Branham and six months later, he ordained Branham as an Independent Baptist minister and an elder in his church. Supported by the KKK&#x27;s Imperial Kludd (chaplain) Caleb Ridley, Branham traveled with Davis and they participated together in revivals in other states.

At the time of Branham&#x27;s conversion, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville was a nominally Baptist church which adhered to some Pentecostal doctrines, including divine healing and speaking in tongues; Branham reported that his baptism at the church was done using the Jesus name formula of Oneness Pentecostalism. Branham claimed to have been opposed to Pentecostalism during the early years of his ministry. However, according to multiple Branham biographers, like Baptist historian Doug Weaver and Pentecostal historian Bernie Wade, Branham was exposed to Pentecostal teachings from his conversion.

Branham claimed to his audiences he was first exposed to a Pentecostal church in 1936, which invited him to join, but he refused. Weaver speculated that Branham may have chosen to hide his early connections to Pentecostalism to make his conversion story more compelling to his Pentecostal audiences during the years of the healing revival. Weaver identified several parts of Branham&#x27;s reported life story that conflicted with historical documentation and suggested that Branham began significantly embellishing his early life story to his audiences beginning in the 1940s.

During June 1933, Branham held tent revival meetings that were sponsored by Davis and the First Pentecostal Baptist Church. On June 2 that year, the &quot;Jeffersonville Evening News&quot; said the Branham campaign reported 14 converts. His followers believed his ministry was accompanied by miraculous signs from its beginning, and that when he was baptizing converts on June 11, 1933, in the Ohio River near Jeffersonville, a bright light descended over him and that he heard a voice say, &quot;As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ, so your message will forerun His second coming&quot;.

Belief in the baptismal story is a critical element of faith among Branham&#x27;s followers. In his early references to the event during the healing revival, Branham interpreted it to refer to the restoration of the gifts of the spirit to the church. In later years, Branham significantly altered how he told the baptismal story, and came to connect the event to his teaching ministry. He claimed reports of the baptismal story were carried in newspapers across the United States and Canada. Because of the way Branham&#x27;s telling of the baptismal story changed over the years, and because no newspaper actually covered the event, Weaver said Branham may have embellished the story after he began achieving success in the healing revival during the 1940s.

Besides Roy Davis and the First Pentecostal Baptist Church, Branham reported interaction with other groups during the 1930s who were an influence on his ministry. During the early 1930s, he became acquainted with William Sowders&#x27; School of the Prophets, a Pentecostal group in Kentucky and Indiana. Through Sowders&#x27; group, he was introduced to the British Israelite House of David and in the autumn of 1934, Branham traveled to Michigan to meet with members of the group.

===Early ministry===
Branham took over leadership of Roy Davis&#x27;s Jeffersonville church in 1934, after Davis was arrested again and extradited to stand trial. Sometime during March or April 1934, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church was destroyed by a fire and Branham&#x27;s supporters at the church helped him organize a new church in Jeffersonville. At first Branham preached out of a tent at 8th and Pratt street, and he also reported temporarily preaching in an orphanage building.

By 1936, the congregation had constructed a new church on the same block as Branham&#x27;s tent, at the corner of 8th and Penn street. The church was built on the same location reported by the local newspaper as the site of his June 1933 tent campaign. Newspaper articles reported the original name of Branham&#x27;s new church to be the Pentecostal Tabernacle. The church was officially registered with the City of Jeffersonville as the Billie Branham Pentecostal Tabernacle in November 1936. Newspaper articles continued to refer to his church as the Pentecostal Tabernacle until 1943. Branham served as pastor until 1946, and the church name eventually shortened to the Branham Tabernacle. The church flourished at first, but its growth began to slow. Because of the Great Depression, it was often short of funds, so Branham served without compensation.

Branham continued traveling and preaching among Pentecostal churches while serving as pastor of his new church. Branham obtained a truck and had it painted with advertisements for his healing ministry which he toured in. In September 1934, he traveled to Mishawaka, Indiana where he was invited to speak at the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ (PAJC) General Assembly meetings organized by Bishop G. B. Rowe. Branham was &quot;not impressed with the multi-cultural aspects of the PAJC as it was contrary to the dogmas advanced by his friends in the Ku Klux Klan.&quot;

Branham and his future wife Amelia Hope Brumbach (b. July 16, 1913) attended the First Pentecostal Baptist Church together beginning in 1929 where Brumbach served as young people&#x27;s leader. The couple began dating in 1933. Branham married Brumbach in June 1934. Their first child, William &quot;Billy&quot; Paul Branham (1935–2023) was born soon after their marriage; the date given for his birth varies by source. In some of Branham&#x27;s biographies, his first son&#x27;s birth date is reported as September 13, 1935, but in government records his birth date is reported as September 13, 1934. Branham&#x27;s wife became ill during the second year of their marriage. According to her death certificate, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in January 1936, beginning a period of declining health. Despite her diagnosis, the couple had a second child, Sharon Rose, who was born on October 27, 1936. In September 1936, the local news reported that Branham held a multi-week healing revival at the Pentecostal Tabernacle in which he reported eight healings.

The following year, disaster struck when Jeffersonville was ravaged by the Ohio River flood of 1937. Branham&#x27;s congregation was badly impacted by the disaster and his family was displaced from their home. By February 1937, the floodwaters had receded, his church survived intact and Branham resumed holding services at the Pentecostal Tabernacle. Following the January flood, Hope&#x27;s health continued to decline, and she succumbed to her illness and died on July 22, 1937. Sharon Rose, who had been born with her mother&#x27;s illness, died four days later (July 26, 1937). Their obituaries reported Branham as pastor of the Pentecostal Tabernacle, the same church where their funerals were held.

Branham frequently related the story of the death of his wife and daughter during his ministry and evoked strong emotional responses from his audiences. Branham told his audiences that his wife and daughter had become suddenly ill and died during the January flood as God&#x27;s punishment because of his failure to embrace Pentecostalism. Branham said he made several suicide attempts following their deaths. Peter Duyzer noted that Branham&#x27;s story of the events surrounding the death of his wife and daughter conflicted with historical evidence; they did not die during the flood, he and his wife were both already Pentecostals before they married, and he was pastor of a Pentecostal church at the time of their deaths.

By the summer of 1940, Branham had resumed traveling and held revival meetings in other nearby communities. Branham married his second wife Meda Marie Broy in 1941, and together they had three children; Rebekah (1946–2014), Sarah (b. 1950), and Joseph (b. 1955).

==Healing revival==
===Background===
Branham is known for his role in the healing revivals that occurred in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, and most participants in the movement regarded him as its initiator. Christian writer John Crowder described the period of revivals as &quot;the most extensive public display of miraculous power in modern history&quot;. Some, like Christian author and countercult activist Hank Hanegraaff, rejected the entire healing revival as a hoax and condemned the movement as cult in his 1997 book &quot;Counterfeit Revival&quot;.

Divine healing is a tradition and belief that was historically held by a majority of Christians but it became increasingly associated with Evangelical Protestantism. The fascination of most of American Christianity with divine healing played a significant role in the popularity and inter-denominational nature of the revival movement.

Branham held massive inter-denominational meetings, from which came reports of hundreds of miracles. Historian David Harrell described Branham and Oral Roberts as the two giants of the movement and called Branham its &quot;unlikely leader.&quot;

===Early campaigns===

Branham had been traveling and holding revival meetings since at least 1940 before attracting national attention. Branham&#x27;s popularity began to grow following the 1942 meetings in Milltown, Indiana where it was reported that a young girl had been healed of tuberculosis. The news of the reported healing was slow to spread, but was eventually reported to a family in Missouri who in 1945 invited Branham to pray for their child who was suffering from a similar illness; Branham reported that the child recovered after his prayers.

News of two events eventually reached W. E. Kidston. Kidston was intrigued by the reported miracles and invited Branham to participate in revival meetings that he was organizing. W. E. Kidston, was editor of &quot;The Apostolic Herald&quot; and had many contacts in the Pentecostal movement. Kidston served as Branham&#x27;s first campaign manager and was instrumental in helping organize Branham&#x27;s early revival meetings.

Branham held his first large meetings as a faith healer in 1946. His healing services are well documented, and he is regarded as the pacesetter for those who followed him. At the time they were held, Branham&#x27;s revival meetings were the largest religious meetings some American cities he visited had ever seen; reports of 1,000 to 1,500 converts per meeting were common.

Historians name his June 1946 St. Louis meetings as the inauguration of the healing revival period. Branham said he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry. In his later years, he also connected the angelic visitation with the establishment of the nation of Israel, at one point mistakenly stating the vision occurred on the same day.

His first reported revival meetings of the period were held over 12 days during June 1946 in St. Louis. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported on his St. Louis campaign meetings, and according to the article, Branham drew a crowd of over 4,000 sick people who desired healing and recorded him diligently praying for each. Branham&#x27;s fame began to grow as a result of the publicity and reports covering his meetings.

&quot;Herald of Faith&quot; magazine which was edited by prominent Pentecostal minister Joseph Mattsson-Boze and published by Philadelphia Pentecostal Church in Chicago also began following and exclusively publishing stories from the Branham campaigns, giving Branham wide exposure to the Pentecostal movement. Following the St. Louis meetings, Branham launched a tour of small Oneness Pentecostal churches across the Midwest and southern United States, from which stemmed reports of healing and one report of a resurrection. By August his fame had spread widely. He held meetings that month in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and drew a crowd of 25,000 with attendees from 28 different states. The size of the crowds presented a problem for Branham&#x27;s team as they found it difficult to find venues that could seat large numbers of attendees.

Branham&#x27;s revivals were interracial from their inception and were noted for their &quot;racial openness&quot; during the period of widespread racial unrest. An African American minister participating in the St. Louis meetings claimed to be healed during the revival, helping to bring Branham a sizable African American following from the early days of the revival. Branham held interracial meetings even in the southern states. To satisfy segregation laws when ministering in the south, Branham&#x27;s team would use a rope to divide the crowd by race.

Author and researcher Patsy Sims noted that venues used to host campaign meetings also hosted KKK rallies just days prior to the revival meetings, which sometimes led to racial tensions. Sims, who attended both the KKK rallies and the healing revivals, was surprised to see some of the same groups of people at both events. According to Steven Hassan, KKK recruitment was covertly conducted through Branham&#x27;s ministry.

After holding a very successful revival meeting in Shreveport during mid-1947, Branham began assembling an evangelical team that stayed with him for most of the revival period. The first addition to the team was Jack Moore and Young Brown, who periodically assisted him in managing his meetings. Following the Shreveport meetings, Branham held a series of meetings in San Antonio, Phoenix, and at various locations in California. Moore invited his friend Gordon Lindsay to join the campaign team, which he did beginning at a meeting in Sacramento, California, in late 1947.

Lindsay was a successful publicist and manager for Branham, and played a key role in helping him gain national and international recognition. In 1948, Branham and Lindsay founded &quot;Voice of Healing&quot; magazine, which was originally aimed at reporting Branham&#x27;s healing campaigns. The story of Samuel the Prophet, who heard a voice speak to him in the night, inspired Branham&#x27;s name for the publication. Lindsay was impressed with Branham&#x27;s focus on humility and unity, and was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance among Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostal groups by expanding his revival meetings beyond the United Pentecostal Church to include all of the major Pentecostal groups.

The first meetings organized by Lindsay were held in northwestern North America during late 1947. At the first of these meetings, held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canadian minister Ern Baxter joined Branham&#x27;s team. Lindsay reported 70,000 attendees to the 14 days of meetings and long prayer lines as Branham prayed for the sick. William Hawtin, a Canadian Pentecostal minister, attended one of Branham&#x27;s Vancouver meetings in November 1947 and was impressed by Branham&#x27;s healings. Branham was an important influence on the Latter Rain revival movement, which Hawtin helped initiate.

In January 1948, meetings were held in Florida; F. F. Bosworth met Branham at the meetings and also joined his team. Bosworth was among the pre-eminent ministers of the Pentecostal movement and a founding minister of the Assemblies of God; Bosworth lent great weight to Branham&#x27;s campaign team. He remained a strong Branham supporter until his death in 1958. Bosworth endorsed Branham as &quot;the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Spirit&quot; he had ever met.

During early 1947, a major campaign was held in Kansas City, where Branham and Lindsay first met Oral Roberts. Roberts and Branham had contact at different points during the revival. Roberts said Branham was &quot;set apart, just like Moses&quot;.

Branham spent many hours ministering and praying for the sick during his campaigns, and like many other leading evangelists of the time he suffered exhaustion. After one year of campaigning, his exhaustion began leading to health issues. Branham reported to his audiences that he suffered a nervous breakdown and required treatment by the Mayo Clinic. Branham&#x27;s illness coincided with a series of allegations of fraud in his healing revivals. Attendees reported seeing him &quot;staggering from intense fatigue&quot; during his last meetings.

Just as Branham began to attract international attention in May 1948, he announced that due to illness he would have to halt his campaign. His illness shocked the growing movement, and his abrupt departure from the field caused a rift between him and Lindsay over the &quot;Voice of Healing&quot; magazine. Branham insisted that Lindsay take over complete management of the publication. With the main subject of the magazine no longer actively campaigning, Lindsay was forced to seek other ministers to promote. He decided to publicize Oral Roberts during Branham&#x27;s absence, and Roberts quickly rose to prominence, in large part due to Lindsay&#x27;s coverage.

Branham partially recovered from his illness and resumed holding meetings in October 1948; in that month he held a series of meetings around the United States without Lindsay&#x27;s support. Branham&#x27;s return to the movement led to his resumed leadership of it. In November 1948, he met with Lindsay and Moore and told them he had received another angelic visitation, instructing him to hold a series of meetings across the United States and then to begin holding meetings internationally. As a result of the meeting, Lindsay rejoined Branham&#x27;s campaigning team.

===Style===
Most revivalists of the era were flamboyant but Branham was usually calm and spoke quietly, only occasionally raising his voice. His preaching style was described as &quot;halting and simple&quot;, and crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitation and &quot;constant communication with God&quot;. Branham tailored his language usage to best connect to his audiences. When speaking to poor and working-class audiences, he tended to use poor grammar and folksy language; when speaking to more educated audiences and ministerial associations, he generally spoke using perfect grammar and avoided slang usage.

He refused to discuss controversial doctrinal issues during the healing campaigns, and issued a policy statement that he would only minister on the &quot;great evangelical truths&quot;. He insisted his calling was to bring unity among the different churches he was ministering to and to urge the churches to return to the roots of early Christianity.

In the first part of his meetings, one of Branham&#x27;s companion evangelists would preach a sermon. Ern Baxter or F. F. Bosworth usually filled this role, but other ministers like Paul Cain also participated in Branham&#x27;s campaigns in later years. Baxter generally focused on bible teaching; Bosworth counseled supplicants on the need for faith and the doctrine of divine healing. Following their build-up, Branham would take the podium and deliver a short sermon, in which he usually related stories about his personal life experiences.

Branham would often request God to &quot;confirm his message with two-or-three faith inspired miracles&quot;. Supplicants seeking healing submitted prayer cards to Branham&#x27;s campaign team stating their name, address, and condition; Branham&#x27;s team would select a number of submissions to be prayed for personally by Branham and organized a prayer line. After completing his sermon, he would proceed with the prayer line where he would pray for the sick. Branham would often tell supplicants what they suffered from, their name, and their address.

He would pray for each of them, pronouncing some or all healed. Branham generally prayed for a few people each night and believed witnessing the results on the stage would inspire faith in the audience and permit them to experience similar results without having to be personally prayed for. Branham would also call out a few members still in the audience, who had not been accepted into the prayer line, stating their illness and pronouncing them healed.

Branham told his audiences that he was able to determine their illness, details of their lives, and pronounce them healed as a result of an angel who was guiding him. Describing Branham&#x27;s method, Bosworth said &quot;he does not begin to pray for the healing of the afflicted in body in the healing line each night until God anoints him for the operation of the gift, and until he is conscious of the presence of the Angel with him on the platform. Without this consciousness he seems to be perfectly helpless.&quot;

Branham explained to his audiences that the angel that commissioned his ministry had given him two signs by which they could prove his commission. He described the first sign as vibrations he felt in his hand when he touched a sick person&#x27;s hand, which communicated to him the nature of the illness, but did not guarantee healing. Branham&#x27;s use of what his fellow evangelists called a word of knowledge gift separated him from his contemporaries in the early days of the revival.

This second sign did not appear in his campaigns until after his recovery in 1948, and was used to &quot;amaze tens of thousands&quot; at his meetings. As the revival progressed, his contemporaries began to mirror the practice. According to Bosworth, this gift of knowledge allowed Branham &quot;to see and enable him to tell the many events of [people&#x27;s] lives from their childhood down to the present&quot;.

This caused many in the healing revival to view Branham as a &quot;seer like the old testament prophets&quot;. Branham amazed even fellow evangelists, which served to further push him into a legendary status in the movement. Branham&#x27;s audiences were often awestruck by the events during his meetings. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and &quot;the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation&quot;.

===Growing fame and international campaigns===
In January 1950, Branham&#x27;s campaign team held their Houston campaign, one of the most significant series of meetings of the revival. The location of their first meeting was too small to accommodate the approximately 8,000 attendees, and they had to relocate to the Sam Houston Coliseum. On the night of January 24, 1950, Branham was photographed during a debate between Bosworth and local Baptist minister W. E. Best regarding the theology of divine healing.

Bosworth argued in favor, while Best argued against. The photograph showed a light above Branham&#x27;s head, which he and his associates believed to be supernatural. The photograph became well-known in the revival movement and is regarded by Branham&#x27;s followers as an iconic relic. Branham believed the light was a divine vindication of his ministry; others believed it was a glare from the venue&#x27;s overhead lighting.

In January 1951, former US Congressman William Upshaw was sent by Roy Davis to a Branham campaign meeting in California. Upshaw had limited mobility for 59 years as the result of an accident, and said he was miraculously healed in the meeting. The publicity of the event took Branham&#x27;s fame to a new level. Upshaw sent a letter describing his healing claim to each member of Congress. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on the healing in an article titled &quot;Ex-Rep. Upshaw Discards Crutches After 59 Years&quot;. Upshaw explained to reporters that he had been able to walk two or three steps without the aid of his crutches prior to attending Branham&#x27;s meeting, but following Branham&#x27;s prayer his strength increased so that he had walked four blocks. Upshaw died in November 1952, at the age of 86.

According to Pentecostal historian Rev. Walter Hollenweger, &quot;Branham filled the largest stadiums and meeting halls in the world&quot; during his five major international campaigns. Branham held his first series of campaigns in Europe during April 1950 with meetings in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Attendance at the meetings generally exceeded 7,000 despite resistance to his meetings by the state churches. Branham was the first American deliverance minister to successfully tour in Europe.

A 1952 campaign in South Africa had the largest attendance in Branham&#x27;s career, with an estimated 200,000 attendees. According to Lindsay, the altar call at his Durban meeting received 30,000 converts. During international campaigns in 1954, Branham visited Portugal, Italy, and India. Branham&#x27;s final major overseas tour in 1955 included visits to Switzerland and Germany.

Branham&#x27;s meetings were regularly attended by journalists, who wrote articles about the miracles reported by Branham and his team throughout the years of his revivals, and claimed patients were cured of various ailments after attending prayer meetings with Branham. &quot;Durban Sunday Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Natal Mercury&quot; reported wheelchair-bound people rising and walking. &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; reported a girl was cured of deafness. &quot;El Paso Herald-Post&quot; reported hundreds of attendees at one meeting seeking divine healing. Despite such occasional glowing reports, most of the press coverage Branham received was negative.

===Allegations of fraud===
To his American audiences, Branham claimed several high profile events occurred during his international tours. Branham claimed to visit and pray for King George VI while en route to Finland in 1950. He claimed the king was healed through his prayers. Researchers found no evidence that Branham ever met King George; King George was chronically ill and died about a year after Branham claimed to heal him.

Branham also claimed to pray for and heal the granddaughter of Florence Nightingale at a London airport. Branham&#x27;s campaign produced photos of an emaciated woman who they claimed to be Nightingale&#x27;s granddaughter. However, Florence Nightingale never married and had no children or grandchildren. Investigators of Branham&#x27;s claim were unable to identify the woman in the photograph.

Branham similarly claimed to pray for King Gustaf V while in Sweden in April 1950. Investigators found no evidence for the meeting; King Gustaf V died in October 1950. Branham claimed to stop in Egypt in 1954 while en route to India to meet with King Farouk; however Farouk had been deposed in 1952 and was not living in Egypt at the time. Branham claimed to visit the grave of Buddha while in India, however Buddha was cremated and has no grave. In total, critics of Branham identified many claims which appeared to be false when investigated. Weaver accused Branham of major embellishments.

Branham faced criticism and opposition from the early days of the healing revival, and he was repeatedly accused of fraud throughout his ministry. According to historian Ronald Kydd, Branham evoked strong opinions from people with whom he came into contact; &quot;most people either loved him or hated him&quot;. Kydd stated that it &quot;is impossible to get even an approximate number of people healed in Branham&#x27;s ministry.&quot; No consistent record of follow-ups of the healing claims were made, making analysis of many claims difficult to subsequent researchers. Additionally, Branham&#x27;s procedures made verification difficult at the time of his revivals. Branham believed in positive confession. He required supplicants to claim to be healed to demonstrate their faith, even if they were still experiencing symptoms. He frequently told supplicants to expect their symptoms to remain for several days after their healing. This led to people professing to be healed at the meetings, while still suffering from the condition. Only follow up after Branham&#x27;s waiting period had passed could ascertain the result of the healing.

From the early days of the healing revival, Branham received overwhelmingly unfavorable coverage in the news media, which was often quite critical. At his June 1947 revivals in Vandalia, Illinois, the local news reported that Beck Walker, a man who was deaf and mute from birth, was pronounced healed but failed to recover. Branham claimed Walker failed to recover his hearing because he had disobeyed Branham&#x27;s instruction to stop smoking cigarettes. Branham was lambasted by critics who asked how it was possible the deaf man could have heard his command to stop smoking.

At his 1947 meetings in Winnipeg, Branham claimed to have raised a young man from the dead at a Jeffersonville funeral parlor. Branham&#x27;s sensational claim was reported in the news in the United States and Canada, leading to a news media investigation to identify the funeral home and the individual raised from the dead. Reporters subsequently found no evidence of a resurrection; no funeral parlor in the city corroborated the story. The same year the news media in Winnipeg publicized Branham&#x27;s cases of failed healing. In response, the churches which hosted Branham&#x27;s campaign conducted independent follow-up interviews with people Branham pronounced healed to gather testimonies which they could use to counter the negative press. To their surprise, their investigation failed to confirm any cases of actual healing; every person they interviewed had failed to recover.

At meetings in Vancouver during 1947, newspaper reporters discovered that one young girl had been in Branham&#x27;s prayer lines in multiple cities posing as a cripple, but rising to walk after Branham pronounced her healed each time. An investigative reporter suspected Branham had staged the miracle. Reporters at the meeting also attempted to follow up on the case of a Calgary woman pronounced healed by Branham who had died shortly after he left the city. Reporters attempted to confront Branham over these issues, but Branham refused to be interviewed.

Branham was also accused of fraud by fellow ministers and churches that hosted his meetings. In 1947, Rev. Alfred Pohl, the Missionary-Secretary of Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, served as Branham&#x27;s guide and host at meetings across western Canada. Pohl stated that many people Branham pronounced as healed later died and produced witnesses to validate his allegations. Pohl stated that the numerous deaths &quot;severely tested the faith&quot; of many ministers who had trusted in Branham. Pohl also claimed Branham was frequently given and accepted large financial gifts from individuals who he pronounced as healed, including those who subsequently died.

In 1948, W. J. Taylor, a district superintendent with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, raised concerns again following another wave of Branham meetings and asked for a thorough investigation. Taylor presented evidence that claims of the number of people healed were vastly overestimated, and that multiple people pronounced healed by Branham had subsequently died. While he stated his personal admiration for Branham, the troubling number of deaths led him to suggest &quot;there is a possibility that this whole thing is wrong&quot;.

Churches in Canada continued to experience crises following Branham campaign meetings as they attempted to explain the numerous failed healings to their congregations. At meetings in Regina, Branham pronounced the wife of a prominent minister healed of cancer. The minister and his wife were overjoyed, and the minister excitedly shared the details of the healing with his radio audience in Ontario later that week. To his surprise, his wife died only days later of her illness. The confusion created by the situation led ministers to claim Branham had deceived them.

According to Kydd, &quot;the controversy surrounding Branham deepened&quot; with time. Kydd reported that by watching films of the revival meetings, &quot;the viewer would assume almost everyone was healed&quot;, but &quot;results were less promising whenever follow-up was made.&quot; One such case was Carol Strubler, who at age nine in 1954 was prayed for by Branham at a recorded revival in Washington, D.C., when he preached a sermon entitled &quot;The Deep Calleth Unto The Deep&quot;. One newspaper reported, &quot;Rev. William Branham of Jeffersonville, Ind., prayed for her and assured the heartbroken mother her daughter would live. A week later the mother told this newspaper she was confident the evangelist&#x27;s words were true and had cancelled a scheduled visit to St. Christopher&#x27;s Hospital in Philadelphia.&quot; However, Strubbler died &quot;of acute leukemia, just three weeks after [Branham] told her mother she was healed of the fatal sickness.&quot; Another case was four-year-old Donny Morton, who was diagnosed with a rare brain condition. At recorded meetings in California during April 1951, Branham pronounced Morton healed, but the child subsequently died in October. His story was published in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

Similar allegations came from Branham&#x27;s European campaigns. Rev. Walter Hollenweger, who served as a translator on Branham&#x27;s European tours, reported that &quot;very few were actually healed&quot; in the campaigns, and the overwhelming majority pronounced healed by Branham failed to recover. Hollenweger said that while there were a few &quot;well-attested cases of miraculous healing&quot;, Branham was &quot;naïve&quot; and &quot;dishonest&quot; and misled his audiences when he reported the number of people healed. Hollenweger was disappointed that Branham refused to acknowledge the numerous failed pronouncements of healings.

In 1955, Leonard Steiner, pastor of a Pentecostal church in Zurich Switzerland that hosted a Branham meeting reported cases of failed healing and the negative consequences for members of his congregation. Allegations in Norway led authorities to limit Branham&#x27;s ability to hold meetings; the Directorate of Health forbade Branham from laying hands on the sick and sent police to his meetings to enforce the order.

Serious allegations also were made following Branham&#x27;s meetings in South Africa during 1952 and complaints were lodged with government authorities. Michael Plaff, a doctor, was pronounced healed of cancer by Branham during one meeting. In February 1952, the Branham campaign published an article claiming Plaff had visited the hospital the day after he was prayed for and his cure was confirmed by medical tests. However, Plaff had died of his cancer just days after being pronounced healed. A minister attending meetings in Durban with his congregation reported that over twenty people suffering from tuberculosis were pronounced healed by Branham, but all failed to recover. In another case, a woman suffering a heart condition was pronounced healed by Branham, but died less than a week later. A 23-year-old leukemia patient was pronounced healed by Branham, but failed to recover and died about thirteen months later.

The Branham campaign published a book entitled &quot;A Prophet Visit South Africa&quot; to publicize the success of the tour. The book related the details of dozens of healings. Investigators in South Africa followed up on the reported healings and found that 46 of the people Branham said had been healed had failed to recover. After reviewing the results of the investigation, one minister concluded &quot;that the cures claimed are so largely exaggerated as to be almost fraudulent in their claim.&quot; When Branham attempted to visit South Africa again in 1965, the South African government placed restrictions on his visa preventing him from holding any healing revivals while he was in the country.

Ern Baxter, who participated in most of Branham&#x27;s campaigns between November 1947 and 1953 including his tours to India and Europe, reflected on the exaggerated reports of miracles in the healing revival in a 1978 interview. He explained that the allegations eroded the trust of the crowds who attended the healing services.

Some attendees of Branham&#x27;s meetings believed that some healings were staged and accused him of selectively choosing who could enter the prayer line. Some people left his meetings disappointed after finding Branham&#x27;s conviction that everyone in the audience could be healed without being in the prayer line proved incorrect. Branham generally attributed the failure of supplicants to receive healing to their lack of faith. According to Pohl, Hollenweger, and Steiner, Branham&#x27;s practice of blaming the supplicant for lack of faith was severely damaging in multiple churches and left many people who failed to receive healing in despair.

The &quot;word of knowledge&quot; gift used by Branham was also subject to much criticism. Hollenweger investigated Branham&#x27;s use of the &quot;word of knowledge gift&quot; and found no instances in which Branham was mistaken in his often-detailed pronouncements. Criticism of Branham&#x27;s use of this gift was primarily around its nature; some asserted that it was a non-Christian practice and accused him of witchcraft and telepathy. Branham was openly confronted with such criticisms and rejected the assertions.

Others alleged that Branham&#x27;s discernments were not genuine. Many people Branham prayed for were required to first write their name, address, and what they were seeking prayer for on prayer cards. The cards were submitted to Branham&#x27;s team who would choose the supplicants to be prayed for by Branham and organize the prayer line. Some critics accused Branham&#x27;s team of sharing prayer card information with Branham before he began his prayer lines.

===Financial difficulties===
In 1955, Branham&#x27;s campaigning career began to slow following financial setbacks. Even after he became famous, Branham continued to wear inexpensive suits and refused large salaries; he was not interested in amassing wealth as part of his ministry and was reluctant to solicit donations during his meetings. During the early years of his campaigns, donations had been able to cover costs, but from 1955, donations failed to cover the costs of three successive campaigns, one of which incurred a $15,000 deficit. ($ in 2020 dollars)

Some of Branham&#x27;s business associates thought he was partially responsible because of his lack of interest in the financial affairs of the campaigns and tried to hold him personally responsible for the debts. Branham briefly stopped campaigning and said he would have to take a job to repay the debt, but the Full Gospel Business Men&#x27;s Fellowship International ultimately offered financial assistance to cover the debt. Branham became increasingly reliant on the Full Gospel Businessmen to finance his campaign meetings as the Pentecostal denominations began to withdraw their financial support.

Finances became an issue again in 1956 when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) charged Branham with tax evasion. The American government targeted the other leading revivalists with lawsuits during the same time period, including Oral Roberts, Jack Coe, and A. A. Allen. The IRS asserted income reported by the ministers as non-taxable gifts was taxable, despite the fact Branham had not kept the gifts for himself. Except Allen, who won his legal battle, the evangelists settled their cases out of court.

The IRS investigation showed Branham did not pay close attention to the amount of money flowing through his ministry, and had failed to document gifts and donations he received or how the proceeds were used. It also revealed that others assisting in his campaigns were taking financial advantage of the campaigns. Branham reported his annual salary to the IRS as $7,000 ($ in 2020 dollars) while his manager Gordon Lindsay&#x27;s was reported at $80,000. ($ in 2020 dollars) Comparatively, Oral Roberts earned a salary of $15,000 in the same years. Branham&#x27;s case was eventually settled out of court when Branham admitted to tax evasion and agreed to pay a $40,000 penalty. ($ in 2020 dollars) Branham was never able to completely pay off the tax liability.

===End of the revival===
By the mid-1950s, dozens of the ministers associated with Branham and his campaigns had launched similar healing campaigns. In 1956, the healing revival reached its peak, as 49 separate evangelists held major meetings. Branham and Lindsay ineffectively attempted to encourage the other evangelists to help their local churches rather than launch national careers. The Branham campaign held meetings across the United States in 1956, and a large meeting in Mexico City that had 20,000 in attendance. However the swelling number of competitors and emulators were further reducing attendance at Branham&#x27;s meetings.

His correspondence also decreased sharply. Whereas he had once received &quot;a thousand letters a day&quot;, by 1956 his mail dropped to 75 letters a day. Branham thought the decline was temporary. He continued expecting something greater, which he said &quot;nobody will be able to imitate&quot;. In 1955, he reported a vision of a renewed tent ministry and a &quot;third pull which would be dramatically different&quot; than his earlier career; he began to increasingly refer to the vision as his popularity began to decline.

Amid the financial issues in 1956, Lindsay left Branham&#x27;s campaign team. Branham eventually criticized the &quot;Voice of Healing&quot; magazine which he had helped create as a &quot;massive financial organization&quot; that put making money ahead of promoting good. The loss of Lindsay as a manager and the publicity of &quot;Voice of Healing&quot; was a major setback for Branham. After 1956, attendance at Branham&#x27;s meetings dwindled and his appeal became limited to the loyal following that developed around him during the earlier years. Branham came to depend on &quot;The Herald of Faith&quot; published by Joseph Mattsson-Bose as his primary publicity tool for the final years of his ministry.

Branham also began to criticize other leading contemporaries in the healing revival leading to open hostilities between the evangelists. In 1957 Branham openly criticized A. A. Allen concerning the validity of a miracle reported in his campaigns. Allen replied by circulating a letter at the Christian Fellowship Convention criticizing Branham for creating divisions and suggesting Branham may soon die as a result of his actions. Branham also began to criticize Oral Roberts and Billy Graham. The bad feelings and breakdown of cooperation between the leaders of the movement contributed to the end of the healing revival.

In the closing years of the revival, Branham helped launch and popularize the ministry of Jim Jones, the founder and leader of the Peoples Temple. According to Historian Catherine Wessinger, while rejecting Christianity as a false religion, Jones covertly used popular Christian figures to advance his own ideology. Jones needed a religious headliner to endorse his ministry and invited Branham to share the platform with him at a self-organized religious convention held at the Cadle Tabernacle auditorium in Indianapolis from June 11 to 15, 1956.

Branham critics Peter Duyzer and John Collins reported that Branham &quot;performed numerous miracles&quot;, drawing a crowd of 11,000. Branham was an important influence on Jones, who copied many of his styles, methods, and teachings. Jones later became known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978.

According to Collins, Jim Jones and Paul Schäfer were influenced to move to South America by Branham&#x27;s 1961 prophecy concerning the destruction of the United States in a nuclear war. Jones later said that he and Branham &quot;did not see eye to eye&quot;, and accused Branham of being disingenuous.

Consensus among historians is that the healing revival ended in 1958. By 1960, the number of evangelists holding national campaigns dropped to 11. Several perspectives on the decline of the healing revival have been offered. Crowder suggested Branham&#x27;s gradual separation from Gordon Lindsay played a major part in the decline. Harrell attributed the decline to the increasing number of evangelists crowding the field and straining the financial resources of the Pentecostal denominations.

Weaver agreed that Pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support for the healing revival, mainly over the financial stresses put on local churches by the healing campaigns. The Assemblies of God were the first to openly withdraw support from the healing revival in 1953. Weaver pointed to other factors that may have helped destroy the initial ecumenism of the revival; tension between the independent evangelists and the Pentecostal churches caused by the evangelists&#x27; fund-raising methods, denominational pride, sensationalism, and doctrinal conflictsparticularly between the Oneness and Trinitarian factions within Pentecostalism. Weaver also believed that &quot;fraud and chicanary&quot; by the revivals evangelists also played a major role in the decline.

==Later life==

As the healing revival began to wane, many of Branham&#x27;s contemporaries moved into the leadership of the emerging Charismatic movement, which emphasized use of spiritual gifts. The Charismatic movement is a global movement within both Protestant and non-Protestant Christianity that supports the adoption of traditionally Pentecostal beliefs, especially the spiritual gifts (charismata). The movement began in the teachings of the healing revival evangelists and grew as their teachings came to receive broad acceptance among millions of Christians.

At the same time the Charismatic movement was gaining broad acceptance, Branham began to transition to a teaching ministry. He began speaking on the controversial doctrinal issues he had avoided for most of the revival. By the 1960s, Branham&#x27;s contemporaries and the Pentecostal denominations that had supported his campaigns regarded him as an extremely controversial teacher.

The leadership of the Pentecostal churches pressed Branham to resist his urge to teach and to instead focus on praying for the sick. Branham refused, arguing that the purpose of his healing ministry was to attract audiences and, having thus been attracted, it was time to teach them the doctrines he claimed to have received through supernatural revelation. Branham argued that his entire ministry was divinely inspired and could not be selectively rejected or accepted, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s either all of God, or none of God&quot;.

At first, Branham taught his doctrines only within his own church at Jeffersonville, but beginning in the 1960s he began to preach them at other churches he visited. His criticisms of Pentecostal organizations, and especially his views on holiness and the role of women, led to his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement and the Pentecostals from whom he had originally achieved popularity. Branham acknowledged their rejection and said their organizations &quot;had choked out the glory and Spirit of God&quot;. As a result of their view of his teachings, many Pentecostals judged that Branham had &quot;stepped out of his anointing&quot; and had become a &quot;bad teacher of heretical doctrine&quot;.

Despite his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement, Branham&#x27;s followers became increasingly dedicated to him during his later life. Some even claimed he was the Messiah, treated him as deity, and began to baptise and pray in his name. Branham quickly condemned their belief as heresy and threatened to stop ministering, but the belief persisted. Many followers moved great distances to live near his home in Jeffersonville and, led by Leo Mercer, subsequently set up a colony in Arizona following Branham&#x27;s move to Tucson in 1962.

Many believed the rapture was imminent and that it was necessary to be near Branham in Arizona to take part. Branham lamented Mercer and the actions of his group as he worried that a cult was potentially being formed among his most fanatical followers. Before he died, some of his followers had already begun compiling his sermons and treating them as oral scripture, with a significant minority of his followers believing in his divinity.

His followers refer to his teachings collectively as &quot;The Message&quot;. Outsiders have referred to his teachings as Branhamism and Branhamology.

==Death==

Branham continued to travel to churches and preach his doctrine across Canada, the United States, and Mexico during the 1960s. His only overseas trip during the 1960s proved a disappointment. Branham reported a vision of himself preaching before large crowds and hoped for its fulfillment on the trip, but the South African government prevented him from holding revivals when he traveled to the country in 1965. Branham was saddened that his teaching ministry was rejected by all but his closest followers.

Pentecostal churches which once welcomed Branham refused to permit him to preach during the 1960s, and those who were still sympathetic to him were threatened with excommunication by their superiors if they did so. He held his final set of revival meetings in Shreveport at the church of his early campaign manager Jack Moore in November 1965. Although he had hinted at it many times, Branham publicly stated for the first time that he was the return of Elijah the prophet in his final meetings in Shreveport.

On December 18, 1965, Branham and his familyexcept his daughter Rebekahwere returning to Jeffersonville, Indiana, from Tucson for the Christmas holiday. About east of Friona, Texas, and about southwest of Amarillo on US Highway 60, just after dark, a car driven by a drunken driver traveling westward in the eastbound lane collided head-on with Branham&#x27;s car. He was rushed to the hospital in Amarillo where he remained comatose for several days and died of his injuries on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1965.

Branham&#x27;s death stunned the Pentecostal world and shocked his followers. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed until April 11, 1966; Easter Monday. Most eulogies only tacitly acknowledged Branham&#x27;s controversial teachings, focusing instead on his many positive contributions and recalling his wide popularity and impact during the years of the healing revival. Gordon Lindsay&#x27;s eulogy stated that Branham&#x27;s death was the will of God and privately he accepted the interpretation of Kenneth E. Hagin, who claimed to have prophesied Branham&#x27;s death two years before it happened. According to Hagin, God revealed that Branham was teaching false doctrine and God was removing him because of his disobedience.

In the confusion immediately following Branham&#x27;s death, expectations that he would rise from the dead developed among his followers. Most believed he would have to return to fulfill a vision he had regarding future tent meetings. Weaver attributed the belief in Branham&#x27;s imminent resurrection to Pearry Green, though Green denied it. Even Branham&#x27;s son Billy Paul seemed to expect his father&#x27;s resurrection and indicated as much in messages sent to Branham&#x27;s followers, in which he communicated his expectation for Easter 1966. The expectation of his resurrection remained strong into the 1970s, in part based on Branham&#x27;s prediction that the rapture could occur by 1977. After 1977, some of his followers abandoned his teachings.

==Legacy and influence==
Branham was the &quot;initiator of the post-World War II healing revival&quot; and, along with Oral Roberts, was one of its most revered leaders. Branham is most remembered for his use of the &quot;sign-gifts&quot; that awed the Pentecostal world. According to writer and researcher Patsy Sims, &quot;the power of a Branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement.&quot; The many revivalists who attempted to emulate Branham during the 1950s spawned a generation of prominent Charismatic ministries.

Branham has been called the &quot;principal architect of restorationist thought&quot; of the Charismatic movement that emerged from the healing revival. The Charismatic view that the Christian church should return to a form like that of the early church has its roots in Branham&#x27;s teachings during the healing revival period. The belief is widely held in the modern Charismatic movement, and the legacy of his restorationist teaching and ministering style is evident throughout televangelism and the Charismatic movement.

The more controversial doctrines Branham espoused in the closing years of his ministry were rejected by the Charismatic movement, which viewed them as &quot;revelatory madness&quot;. Charismatics are apologetic towards Branham&#x27;s early ministry and embrace his use of the &quot;sign-gifts&quot;. Charismatic author John Crowder wrote that his ministry should not be judged by &quot;the small sliver of his later life&quot;, but by the fact that he indirectly &quot;lit a fire&quot; that began the modern Charismatic movement. Non-Charismatic Christianity completely rejected Branham.

Crowder said Branham was a victim of &quot;the adoration of man&quot; because his followers began to idolize him in the later part of his ministry. Harrell took a similar view, attributing Branham&#x27;s teachings in his later career to his close friends, who manipulated him and took advantage of his lack of theological training. Weaver also attributed Branham&#x27;s eschatological teachings to the influence of a small group of his closest followers, who encouraged his desire for a unique ministry. According to Weaver, to Branham&#x27;s dismay, his followers had placed him at the &quot;center of a Pentecostal personality cult&quot; in the final years of his ministry.

Edward Babinski describes Branham&#x27;s followers as &quot;odd in their beliefs, but for the most part honest hard-working citizens&quot;, and wrote that calling them a cult &quot;seems unfair&quot;. While rejecting Branham&#x27;s teachings, Duyzer offered a glowing review of Branham&#x27;s followers, stating he &quot;had never experienced friendship, or love like we did there&quot;. Though Branham is no longer widely known outside Pentecostalism, his legacy continues today. Summarizing the contrasting views held of Branham, Kydd stated, &quot;Some thought he was God. Some thought he was a dupe of the devil. Some thought he was an end-time messenger sent from God, and some still do.&quot;
Followers of Branham&#x27;s teachings can be found around the world; Branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his campaign meetings. In 1986, there were an estimated 300,000 followers. In 2000, the William Branham Evangelical Association had missions on every inhabited continentwith 1,600 associated churches in Latin America and growing missions across Africa. In 2018, Voice of God Recordings claimed to serve Branham-related support material to about two million people through the William Branham Evangelical Association, and estimated there were 2–4 million total followers of Branham&#x27;s teachings.

Branham&#x27;s followers do not have a central unifying leadership. Shortly after Branham&#x27;s death, his followers divided in multiple feuding groups. Many different followers of Branham&#x27;s teachings have claimed to be his immediate successor, or an Elisha to his Elijah. Many also believe that Branham&#x27;s son Joseph has claimed the inheritance of his father&#x27;s ministry. Each of the men claiming to be his successor have established new sects of Branham&#x27;s followers. His followers &quot;range widely in belief in practice.&quot; Some followers have attempted to reform Branham&#x27;s most extreme teachings. While most churches adhere to a common set of tenets, the &quot;extreme local authority&quot; of the church promoted by Branham has led to widespread differences in interpretation of Branham&#x27;s prophetic teachings. One common theme among all groups is the belief that Branham was the return of Elijah the prophet and receiving his prophetic revelations is necessary to escape the impending destruction of the world.
Some groups of Branham&#x27;s followers refuse medical treatment because of their divine healing beliefs. Many followers of Branham&#x27;s teachings live within insular communities, with their own schools and with no access to television or internet or outside media. Some groups prohibit their members from having relationships with outsiders. Those who leave are often shunned or disowned.
People who try to leave the teachings of Branham often face extreme repercussions. Carl Dyck wrote, &quot;Those who have come out of this group give solemn evidence of the devastating effect that Branhamism had on them, both emotionally and psychologically. In fact, the followers of Branham pray that evil will come upon people who leave their church.&quot; Branham&#x27;s followers have harassed critics and individuals who reject Branham&#x27;s teachings. Dyck reported that people who published material critical of Branham&#x27;s teachings have been threatened by his followers and warned they may be killed. The news media have also reported critics of Branham&#x27;s teaching being threatened and harassed by his followers.

In his book &quot;Churches that Abuse&quot;, Ronald Enroth wrote that some churches use Branham&#x27;s teachings to &quot;belittle, insult, and berate&quot; their members as part of their discipleship teachings on submission, humility, and obedience. According to Enroth, Branham&#x27;s followers believe subjecting themselves to this treatment is necessary for them to &quot;be refined and perfect&quot; and &quot;ready to meet Jesus&quot; at this second coming. Enroth reported instances of families being separated, with children being taken from their parents and reassigned to other families to be raised as a form of discipline. He also reported multiple cases of physical abuse against both adults and children in the United States and Mexico.

Branham&#x27;s followers are widely spread throughout the world. In Iran, Branham&#x27;s followers have faced persecution, with the government shutting down ten of their house churches in 2018 and jailing several Branham followers. In 2020, the Russian government labeled missionaries of Branham&#x27;s teaching as &quot;extremists&quot; and banned the importation of Branham-related publications to the Russian Federation.

<text>Mahlon R. Pitney IV (February 5, 1858 – December 9, 1924) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives for two terms from 1895 to 1899. He later served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1912 to 1922.

==Early life and education==
Pitney was born on February 5, 1858, in Morristown, New Jersey. The American Pitney family dates back to 1720 when two Scots—Johnathan and James Pitney—settled the Pitney farm in Mendham Township, New Jersey. James&#x27;s son, Mahlon Pitney, fought in the American Revolutionary War alongside George Washington. Mahlon Pitney IV was born in Morristown, the son of Sarah Louise (née Halsted) and Henry Cooper Pitney. He attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) where he was a classmate of Woodrow Wilson and served as manager of the campus baseball team. Upon graduation in 1879, he read law at his father&#x27;s practice. Pitney passed the bar exam in 1882 and set up a private practice in Dover, working for a time in partnership with his brother, John Oliver Halstead Pitney.

He returned to Morristown in 1889 to assume control of his father&#x27;s law firm, after Henry Pitney was appointed to a judgeship. Pitney married Florence Shelton in 1891. The couple had three children, and both of their sons attended Princeton University and later entered into the field of law. Pitney was the great-grandfather of actor Christopher Reeve on Reeve&#x27;s mother&#x27;s side, as well as his step great-grandfather on his father&#x27;s side. Christopher Reeve&#x27;s maternal grandmother was Beatrice Pitney, and his paternal grandmother married Mahlon Pitney IV.

==Political career==
=== Congress ===
In 1894, Pitney ran for the United States House of Representatives. He defeated one-term incumbent Johnston Cornish for the seat from New Jersey&#x27;s 4th congressional district, and was reelected to a second term two years later. Pitney served as chairman of the 1895 state Republican convention and pushed for the nomination of John W. Griggs as party gubernatorial candidate. A rising star in state politics, Pitney aspired to be elected as governor.

=== State office ===
In order to further improve his local standing, he resigned from the House prior to the end of his second term and ran for election to the New Jersey Senate; Pitney was victorious in this 1898 race. In the legislature, he took on the role of party floor leader and, after the 1900 election, swayed body control to the Republicans. Later, Pitney became Senate President.

==Judicial career==
Despite Pitney&#x27;s desire to become the state&#x27;s chief executive, Governor Foster M. Voorhees supported a different candidate as his successor. In 1901 Voorhees offered Pitney a seat on the New Jersey Supreme Court, which rid Voorhees of a political rival while maintaining party unity. Seven years later, Pitney was elevated to the role of Chancellor of New Jersey, a unique judicial position under the state&#x27;s 1844 constitution.

==Supreme Court of the United States==

Pitney was nominated by President William Howard Taft on February 19, 1912, to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, to succeed John Marshall Harlan. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on March 13, 1912, by a 50–26 vote, and was sworn into office on March 18, 1912. Although confirmed by a wide margin, the nomination was opposed by progressives. This hostility was particularly due to Pitney&#x27;s decision while serving as chancellor in &quot;Jones Glass Co. v. Glass Bottle Blowers Association&quot;, which limited the ability of unions to prevent their employers from using strikebreakers.

During his time on the court, Pitney developed a relatively conservative reputation and was an adherent of the judicial philosophy of substantive due process. This belief was exemplified in his majority opinion in &quot;Coppage v. Kansas&quot;, where, in ruling unconstitutional a Kansas statute banning anti-union yellow-dog contracts, the court stated that police power could not be legitimately used to ensure equality of bargaining power. Although distrustful of unions, Pitney also feared the rampant expansion of business and supported a broader use of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Justice Pitney authored the majority opinion in &quot;New York Central Railroad Co. v. White&quot;, in which the Court upheld a New York state workman&#x27;s compensation law and laid the foundation for the expansion of these programs nationwide. He also wrote the controversial majority opinion in &quot;Frank v. Mangum&quot;, which upheld the wrongful 1915 murder conviction of Leo Frank, a Jewish businessman, in Atlanta, Georgia, over the dissents of Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Charles Evans Hughes.
Pitney resigned from the court in 1922 after suffering a stroke. Alongside Willis Van Devanter, Pitney was one of only two Supreme Court Justices nominated by President Taft who also later served with Taft during Taft&#x27;s chief justiceship.

==Death and legacy==
Pitney died in 1924 in Washington, D.C., and was interred at Evergreen Cemetery, in Morristown, New Jersey.

When asked which twentieth-century Supreme Court justice &quot;has done the most to protect the core Constitutional values,&quot; Richard Epstein cited Justice Pitney, calling him &quot;a great justice&quot; and &quot;the only consistent near-libertarian on the Supreme Court.&quot; His daughter Beatrice Pitney Lamb was a writer on political topics, and the grandmother of actor Christopher Reeve.

<text>The Rab family of proteins is a member of the Ras superfamily of small G proteins. Approximately 70 types of Rabs have now been identified in humans. Rab proteins generally possess a GTPase fold, which consists of a six-stranded beta sheet which is flanked by five alpha helices.

Rab GTPases regulate many steps of membrane trafficking, including vesicle formation, vesicle movement along actin and tubulin networks, and membrane fusion. These processes make up the route through which cell surface proteins are trafficked from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and are recycled. Surface protein recycling returns proteins to the surface whose function involves carrying another protein or substance inside the cell, such as the transferrin receptor, or serves as a means of regulating the number of a certain type of protein molecules on the surface.

== Function ==

Rab proteins are peripheral membrane proteins, anchored to a membrane via a lipid group covalently linked to an amino acid. Specifically, Rabs are anchored via prenyl groups on two cysteines in the C-terminus. Rab escort proteins (REPs) deliver newly synthesized and prenylated Rab to its destination membrane by binding the hydrophobic, insoluble prenyl groups and carrying Rab through the cytoplasm. The lipid prenyl groups can then insert into the membrane, anchoring Rab at the cytoplasmic face of a vesicle or the plasma membrane. Because Rab proteins are anchored to the membrane through a flexible C-terminal region, they can be thought of as a &#x27;balloon on a string&#x27;.

Rabs switch between two conformations, an inactive form bound to GDP (guanosine diphosphate), and an active form bound to GTP (guanosine triphosphate). A guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalyzes the conversion from GDP-bound to GTP-bound form, thereby activating the Rab. The inherent GTP hydrolysis of Rabs can be enhanced by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) leading to Rab inactivation. REPs carry only the GDP-bound form of Rab, and Rab effectors, proteins with which Rab interacts and through which it functions, only bind the GTP-bound form of Rab. Rab effectors are very heterogeneous, and each Rab isoform has many effectors through which it carries out multiple functions. The specific binding of the effector to the Rab protein allows the Rab protein to be effective, and conversely, the conformation shift of the Rab protein to the inactive state leads to effector dissociation from the Rab protein.

Effector proteins have one of four different functions. 
# Cargo budding, selection, and coating
# Vesicle transport
# Vesicle uncoating and tethering
# Vesicle fusion
After membrane fusion and effector dissociation, Rab is recycled back to its membrane of origin. A GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) binds the prenyl groups of the inactive, GDP-bound form of Rab, inhibits the exchange of GDP for GTP (which would reactivate the Rab) and delivers Rab to its original membrane.

==Clinical significance==
Rab proteins and their functions are essential to proper organelle function, and as such, when any deviation is introduced to the Rab protein cycle, physiological disease states ensue.

=== Choroideremia ===
Choroideremia is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the &quot;CHM&quot; gene which codes for Rab escort protein (REP-1). REP-1 and REP-2 (a REP-1 like protein) both help with the prenylation and transport of Rab proteins. Rab27 has been found to preferentially depend on REP-1 for prenylation, which could be the underlying cause of choroideremia.

=== Intellectual disability ===
Mutations in the &quot;GDI1&quot; gene, which encodes a guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, have been shown to lead to X-linked nonspecific intellectual disability. In a study done on mice, carriers for a deletion of the &quot;GDI1&quot; gene have shown marked abnormalities in short-term memory formation and social interaction patterns. It is noted that the social and behavioral patterns exhibited in mice that are carriers of the GDI1 protein are similar to those observed in humans with the same deletion. The loss of the &quot;GDI1&quot; gene has been shown through brain extracts of the mutant mice to lead to the accumulation of the Rab4 and Rab5 proteins, thus inhibiting their function.

=== Cancer/carcinogenesis ===
Evidence shows that overexpression of Rab GTPases have a striking relationship with carcinogenesis, such as in prostate cancer. There are many mechanisms by which Rab protein dysfunction has been shown to cause cancer. To name a few, elevated expression of the oncogenic Rab1, along with Rab1A proteins, promote the growth of tumors, often with a poor prognosis. The overexpression of Rab23 has been linked to gastric cancer. In addition to directly causing cancer, dysregulation of Rab proteins has also been linked to progression of already existent tumors, and contributing to their malignancy.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
Mutations of the Rab39b protein have been linked to X-linked intellectual disability and also to a rare form of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Types of Rab proteins==
There are approximately 70 different Rabs that have been identified in humans thus far. They are mostly involved in vesicle trafficking. Their complexity can be understood if thought of as address labels for vesicle trafficking, defining the identity and routing of vesicles. Shown in parentheses are the equivalent names in the model organisms &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus nidulans&quot;.

<text>The caracole or caracol (from the Spanish &quot;caracol&quot; - &quot;snail&quot;) is a turning maneuver on horseback in dressage and, previously, in military tactics.

In dressage, riders execute a caracole as a single half turn, either to the left or to the right, representative of the massed cavalry tactic of caracole previously used in the military.

==Military use==
Variations of the military caracole has a long history of usage by various cavalry forces that used missile weapons throughout history. The Scythians and Parthians were thought to use it, while ancient Iberian cavalry famously developed their own variation known as the &#x27;Cantabrian circle&#x27;. It was noted in the 13th century to be used by the Mongols of Genghis Khan and also by the Han Chinese military much earlier (likely learning it from their battles with the Xiongnu nomads). It was later revived by European militaries in the mid-16th century in an attempt to integrate gunpowder weapons into cavalry tactics. Equipped with one or more wheellock pistols or similar firearms, cavalrymen would advance on their target at less than a gallop in formation as deep as twelve ranks. As each rank came into range, the soldiers would turn their mount slightly to one side, discharge one pistol, then turn slightly to the other side to discharge another pistol at their target. The horsemen then retired to the back of the formation to reload, and then repeat the manoeuvre. The whole caracole formation might move slowly forward as each rank fired to help press the attack, or move slowly backward to avoid an enemy&#x27;s advance. Despite this complex manoeuvring, the formation was kept dense rather than open, as the cavalrymen were generally also armed and armoured for melee, and hoped to follow the caracole with a charge. The tactic was accompanied by the increasing popularity of the German &quot;Reiter&quot; in Western armies from about 1540.

The effectiveness of the caracole is debated. This tactic was often successfully implemented, for instance, at the battle of Pinkie Cleugh, where the mounted Spanish herguletier under Dom Pedro de Gamboa successfully harassed Scottish pike columns. Likewise, at the battle of Dreux mercenary German reiters in the Huguenot employ inflicted huge casualties on the Royal Swiss pike squares, although they failed to break them. At the battle of Lützen in 1632, the Swedish Brigade suffered 50% casualties and retreated from Johann von Götzen&#x27;s Imperial cuirassier and Ottavio Piccolomini&#x27;s cavalry arquebusier regiments who used the caracole effectively.

Some historians after Michael Roberts associate the demise of the caracole with the name of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (1594–1632). Certainly he regarded the technique as fairly useless, and ordered cavalry under Swedish command not to use the caracole; instead, he required them to charge aggressively like their Polish-Lithuanian opponents. However, there is plenty of evidence that the caracole was falling out of use by the 1580s at the latest. Henry IV&#x27;s Huguenot cavalry and Dutch cuirassiers were good examples of cavalry units that abandoned the caracole early on — if they ever used it at all.

According to De la Noue, Henry IV&#x27;s pistol-armed cavalrymen were instructed to deliver a volley at close quarters and then &quot;charge home&quot; (charge into the enemy). Ranks were reduced from twelve to six, still enough to punch a hole into the classic thin line in which heavy lancers were deployed. That was the tactic usually employed by cavalry since then, and the name &quot;reiter&quot; was replaced by &quot;cuirassier&quot;. Sometimes it has been erroneously identified as caracole when low morale cavalry units, instead of charging home, contented themselves with delivering a volley and retire without closing the enemy, but in all those actions the distinctive factor of the caracole, the rolling fire through countermarching, was absent.

The caracole was rarely tried against enemy cavalry, as it could be easily broken when performing the maneuver by a countercharge. The last recorded example of the use of the caracole against enemy cavalry ended in disaster at the battle of Klushino in 1610, when the Polish hussars smashed a unit of Russian reiters, which served as the catalyst for the rout of much of the Russian army. The battle of Mookerheyde (1574) was also another example of the futility in using caracole against aggressive enemy cavalry, as 400 Spanish lancers charged 2,000 German reiters (in Dutch employ) while the second line was reloading their pistols, easily routing the whole force and later the whole Dutch army as well. It is significant that 20 years later, the Dutch cuirassiers easily routed the same Spanish lancers at the battle of Turnhout and the battle of Nieuwpoort, so that according to Charles Oman, in 1603 lancers were finally disbanded from the Spanish army. Nevertheless, variations of caracole tactics continued to be used well into the 17th century against enemy cavalry. During the battle of Gniew of 1626, the Polish light cavalry used it with success twice. The first time light cavalry units under Mikołaj Abramowicz fired at the Swedish cavalry rank by rank, but instead of withdrawing to reload, it immediately proceeded to charge the enemy with sabres. Later the same unit also tried the caracole using gaps in the line of charging husaria heavy cavalry.

16th- and 17th-century sources do not seem to have used the term &quot;caracole&quot; in its modern sense. John Cruso, for example, explained the &quot;caracoll&quot; as a maneuver whereby a formation of cuirassiers received an enemy&#x27;s charge by wheeling apart to either side, letting the enemy rush in between the pincers of their trap, and then charging inwards against the flanks of the overextended enemy.

<doc id="912089" wikidata="Q918630" url="?curid=912089" title="Charlie Munger">
<text>Charles Thomas Munger (January 1, 1924November 28, 2023) was an American businessman, investor, attorney and philanthropist. He was vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett, from 1978 until his death in 2023. Buffett described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man, and credited him with being the &quot;architect&quot; of modern Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s business philosophy.

In addition to his role at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a founding partner of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson; chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 through 2011; chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation, based in Los Angeles, California; and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.

==Early life and education==
Charles Thomas Munger was born on January 1, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Florence &quot;Toody&quot; (Russell) and Alfred Case Munger, a lawyer. As a teenager, he worked at Buffett &amp; Son, a grocery store owned by Warren Buffett&#x27;s grandfather, Ernest P. Buffett. His grandfather, Thomas Charles Munger, was a state representative and later a U.S. district court judge appointed by Theodore Roosevelt.

He enrolled in the University of Michigan, where he studied mathematics. During his time in college, he joined the fraternity Sigma Phi Society. In early 1943, a few days after his 19th birthday, he dropped out of college to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he became a second lieutenant. After receiving a high score on the Army General Classification Test, he was ordered to study meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, California, the town he was to make his home.

Through the G.I. Bill, Munger took a number of advanced courses through several universities. When he applied to his father&#x27;s alma mater, Harvard Law School, the dean of admissions rejected him because Munger had not completed an undergraduate degree. However, the dean relented after a call from Roscoe Pound, the former dean of Harvard Law and a Munger family friend. Munger excelled in law school, becoming a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and graduating in 1948 with a J.D., &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

In college and the Army, he developed what he considered &quot;an important skill&quot;: card playing. He used this in his approach to business. &quot;What you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you, or if you have a big edge, back it heavily because you don&#x27;t get a big edge often. Opportunity comes, but it doesn&#x27;t come often, so seize it when it does come.&quot; He also used the card analogy to explain his approach to investing. He maintained that treating the shares of a company like baseball cards is a losing strategy because it requires one to predict the behavior of often irrational and emotional human beings.

==Career==
Munger moved with his family to California, where he joined the law firm Wright &amp; Garrett (later Musick, Peeler &amp; Garrett). In 1962, he founded and worked as a real estate attorney at Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson LLP. He then gave up the practice of law to concentrate on managing investments and later partnered with Otis Booth in real estate development. When he met Buffett over lunch at the Omaha Club, &quot;the two began talking about investments and never stopped.&quot;

In 1962, Munger partnered with Jack Wheeler to form Wheeler, Munger, and Company, an investment firm with a seat on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. According to Buffett&#x27;s essay &quot;The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville&quot;, published in 1984, Munger&#x27;s investment partnership generated compound annual returns of 19.8% during the 1962–75 period compared to a 5.0% annual appreciation rate for the Dow. He wound up Wheeler, Munger, and Co. in 1976, after losses of 32% in 1973 and 31% in 1974.

Munger was previously the chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. The acquisition of this company was controversial following accusations that Buffett&#x27;s company, Blue Chip, bought Wesco shares to defeat an impending merger between Wesco and Financial Corp. Wesco began as a savings and loan association, but eventually grew to control Precision Steel Corp., CORT Furniture Leasing, Kansas Bankers Surety Company, and other ventures. Wesco Financial also held a concentrated equity portfolio of over US$1.5 billion in companies such as Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft Foods, US Bancorp, and Goldman Sachs. Munger believed that holding a concentrated number of stocks that he knew extremely well would in the long term produce superior returns.

Wesco is based in Pasadena, California, Munger&#x27;s adopted hometown. Pasadena was also the site of the company&#x27;s annual shareholders&#x27; meeting, which were typically held on the Wednesday or Thursday after the more famous Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Munger&#x27;s meetings were nearly as legendary in the investment community as those he co-hosted with Buffett in Omaha. Such meetings were often perfunctory, but Munger interacted with the other Wesco shareholders at considerable length, sometimes speculating about what Benjamin Franklin would do in a given situation. Meeting notes have been posted on the &quot;Futile Finance?&quot; website, but no updates exist beyond 2011.

Munger was also the chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation. After Wesco meetings ended, the Daily Journal annual meeting grew in importance, as investors flocked to the meeting to listen to him speak at length.

==Investment philosophy==
===&quot;Elementary, worldly wisdom&quot;===

In multiple speeches, and in the 2005 book &quot;Poor Charlie&#x27;s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger&quot;, &quot;worldly wisdom&quot; consists of a set of mental models framed as a latticework to help solve critical business problems.
Munger, along with Buffett, was one of the main inspirations behind the book &quot;Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger&quot;. Author Peter Bevelin explained his key learnings from both Munger and Buffett in a 2007 interview: &quot;How to think about businesses and investing, how to behave in life, the importance of ethics and honesty, how to approach problems but foremost how to reduce the chance of meeting problems.&quot; Bevelin stated that previously, he &quot;was lacking the Munger ability to un-learn my own best-loved ideas&quot;.

Munger stated that high ethical standards were integral to his philosophy; at the 2009 Wesco Financial Corporation annual meeting he said, &quot;Good businesses are ethical businesses. A business model that relies on trickery is doomed to fail.&quot; During an interview and Q&amp;A session at Harvard-Westlake School on January 19, 2010, Munger referred to American philosopher Charles Frankel in his discussion on the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the philosophy of responsibility. Munger explained that Frankel believed:

The system is responsible in proportion to the degree that the people who make the decisions bear the consequences. So to Charlie Frankel, you don&#x27;t create a loan system where all the people who make the loans promptly dump them on somebody else through lies and twaddle, and they don&#x27;t bear the responsibility when the loans are good or bad. To Frankel, that is amoral, that is an irresponsible system.

As part of his philosophy Munger lived in the same relatively modest California home for 70 years. When asked about living in more luxurious homes, Munger was quoted as stating: &quot;in practically every case, they make the person less happy, not happier.” Munger appreciated the utility of a &quot;basic house&quot; with few advantages over living in an ostentatious home. Munger appreciated modesty stating, &quot;don&#x27;t have a lot of envy&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t overspend your income&quot;. In Munger&#x27;s last 2023 interview with CNBC he credited his success and longevity to a long-held sense of caution and ability &quot;to avoid all standard ways of failing&quot;.

===Lollapalooza effect===

Munger used the term &quot;Lollapalooza effect&quot; for multiple biases, tendencies or mental models acting in compound with each other at the same time in the same direction. With the Lollapalooza effect, itself a mental model, the result is often extreme, due to the confluence of the mental models, biases or tendencies acting together, greatly increasing the likelihood of acting irrationally.

During a talk at Harvard in 1995 titled &quot;The Psychology of Human Misjudgment&quot;, Munger mentioned Tupperware parties and open outcry auctions, where he explained &quot;three, four, five of these things work together and it turns human brains into mush,&quot; meaning that normal people will be highly likely to succumb to the multiple irrational tendencies acting in the same direction. In the Tupperware party, you have reciprocation, consistency, and commitment tendency, and social proof. (The hostess gave the party and the tendency is to reciprocate; you say you like certain products during the party so purchasing would be consistent with views you&#x27;ve committed to; other people are buying, which is the social proof.) 
In the open outcry auction, there is social proof of others bidding, reciprocation tendency, commitment to buying the item, and deprivation super-reaction syndrome, i.e. sense of loss. The latter is an individual&#x27;s sense of loss of what he or she believes should be (or is) his or hers. These biases often occur at either conscious or subconscious level, and in both microeconomic and macroeconomic scale.

===Criticism of cryptocurrencies and Robinhood===
Munger was critical of cryptocurrencies, referring to Bitcoin in particular as &quot;noxious poison&quot;. Munger also compared Robinhood to gambling, saying that its success is due to &quot;people who know how to take advantage essentially of the gambling instincts of, not only American public, worldwide public&quot; and further explained why he thinks individual investments without commission is tantamount to gambling. &quot;If you cater to those gambling chips, when people have money in their pocket for the first time, and you tell them they can make 30 or 40 or 50 trades a day, and you&#x27;re not charging them any commission, but you&#x27;re selling their order flow or whatever, I hope we don&#x27;t have more of it.&quot; He also said the use of cryptocurrency should be banned and said it was &quot;beneath contempt&quot;; that bitcoin was &quot;stupid, &quot;immoral,&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot; and that It&#x27;s like somebody else is trading turds and you decide, &#x27;I can&#x27;t be left out; and that it was like a venereal disease, among other things.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
At the time of his death, Munger had an estimated net worth of $2.6 billion and was ranked as the 1,182nd richest person in the world, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.
Munger was a major benefactor of the University of Michigan. In 2007, Munger made a $3 million gift to the University of Michigan Law School for lighting improvements in Hutchins Hall and the William W. Cook Legal Research Building, including the noted Reading Room. In 2011, Munger made another gift to the Law School, contributing $20 million for renovations to the Lawyers Club housing complex, which covered the majority of the $39 million cost. The renovated portion of the Lawyers Club was renamed the Charles T. Munger Residences in the Lawyers Club in his honor.

In 1997, the Mungers donated $1.8 million to the Marlborough School in Los Angeles, of which Nancy Munger was an alumna. The couple also donated to the Polytechnic School in Pasadena and the Los Angeles YMCA.

On December 28, 2011, Munger donated 10 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock (then valued at approximately $1.2 million total) to the University of Michigan.

Munger and his late wife Nancy B. Munger were major benefactors of Stanford University. Nancy Munger was an alumna of Stanford, and Wendy Munger, Charlie Munger&#x27;s daughter from a previous marriage, was also an alumna (A.B. 1972). Both Nancy and Wendy Munger served as members of the Stanford board of trustees.

In 2023, Munger made a gift of stock worth $40 million to the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Museum in San Marino, California. He gave 77 Class A Berkshire Hathaway shares valued at more than $40.3 million to the Huntington, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A decade ago, he gave the institution nearly $33 million worth of Berkshire stock to help pay for a new education and visitors center.

Munger did not sign The Giving Pledge that was started by his partner Warren Buffett and co-director, Bill Gates, explaining that he &quot;[could]n&#x27;t do it&quot; because &quot;[he had] already transferred so much to [his] children that [he had] already violated it.&quot;

===Architectural activities===

Though Munger had no formal architectural training, he contributed heavily to numerous building designs, including dormitories at Stanford University and the University of Michigan, as well as his final home. He donated to universities on the precondition that the universities follow his architectural blueprints exactly. In multiple cases, Munger promoted key architectural concepts of his own liking, and ceded professional architectural responsibility to a licensed architect of record, e.g., Hartman-Cox Architects in the case of the dormitory at Michigan, and the firm of VTBS for the U.C. Santa Barbara residence hall.

In 2004, the Mungers donated 500 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock, then valued at $43.5 million, to Stanford to build a graduate student housing complex. The Munger Graduate Residence at Stanford University, funded and designed by Munger himself, opened in late 2009 and now houses 600 law and graduate students. The Munger family gave a major gift to Stanford&#x27;s Green Library to fund the restoration of the Bing Wing as well as the construction of a rotunda on the library&#x27;s second floor, and endowed the Munger Chair in Nancy and Charles Munger Professorship of Business at Stanford Law School.

Munger was a trustee of the Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles for more than 40 years, and previously served as chair of the board of trustees. His five sons and stepsons as well as at least one grandson graduated from the prep school. In 2006, Munger donated 100 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock, then valued at $9.2 million, to the school toward a building campaign at Harvard-Westlake&#x27;s middle school campus. The Mungers had previously made a gift to build the $13 million Munger Science Center at the high school campus, a two-story classroom and laboratory building which opened in 1995 and has been described as &quot;a science teacher&#x27;s dream&quot;. The design of the Science Center was substantially influenced by Munger. In 2009, Munger donated eight shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock, worth nearly $800,000, to Harvard-Westlake.

On April 18, 2013, the University of Michigan announced the single largest gift in its history: a $110 million gift from Munger to fund a new &quot;state of the art&quot; residence designed to foster a community of scholars, where graduate students from multiple disciplines can live and exchange ideas. The gift included $10 million for graduate student . Munger designed the residence, which houses 600 single bedrooms, most of which are windowless in order to accommodate a greater number of single-occupant bedrooms. Munger Graduate Residences at the University of Michigan opened in 2015.

In October 2014, Munger announced that he would donate $65 million to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This is the largest gift in the history of the school. The donation went toward construction of a residence building designed by Munger for visitors of the Kavli Institute in an effort to bring together physicists to exchange ideas as Munger stated, &quot;to talk to one another, create new stuff, cross-fertilize ideas&quot;.

In March 2016, Munger announced a further $200 million gift to UC Santa Barbara, conditioned on the university&#x27;s commitment to spend it on the construction of Munger Hall, an undergraduate dormitory of Munger&#x27;s own unconventional design preferences, notably windowless bedrooms and common areas, while tripling the record gift he gave for the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. In October 2021, Munger&#x27;s insistence that the university follow his design compelled architect Dennis McFadden, who had served the university for two decades, to resign from the university&#x27;s Design Review Committee. McFadden stated that the windowless, 1.68-million-square-foot dormitory would be 
 In August 2023, after widespread backlash to what critics called the &quot;windowless dorm,&quot; UC Santa Barbara abandoned the project and began to solicit alternative housing proposals. Munger also withdrew his pledge of support.

==Personal life==
In 1945, while studying at Caltech, Munger married Nancy Huggins, daughter of Frederick R. Huggins and Edith M. Huggins. She was a Pasadena native who had been Munger&#x27;s sister&#x27;s roommate at Scripps College. They had three children, Wendy Munger (a former corporate lawyer, trustee of Stanford University, and trustee of The Huntington Library), Molly Munger (a civil rights attorney and funder of a ballot initiative to raise California taxes for public education), and Teddy Munger (deceased, leukemia, age 9).

After Munger&#x27;s divorce, he remarried within a couple of years to Nancy Barry, daughter of David Noble Barry Jr. and Emilie Hevener Barry. They had four children: physicist and Republican activist Charles T. Munger Jr., Emilie Munger Ogden, Barry A. Munger, and Philip R. Munger. Munger also had two stepchildren from his second marriage: William Harold Borthwick and David Borthwick.

On July 22, 2002, Munger&#x27;s first wife, Nancy Huggins Freeman, died of cancer at age 76.

On February 6, 2010, Munger&#x27;s second wife, Nancy Barry Munger, died at home at age 86.

Munger was a Republican and provided his opinions on a number of political topics including the policies of the Trump administration. Munger stated he was &quot;not a normal Republican&quot;, for example advocating &quot;Medicare for all&quot; as a fix to the U.S. healthcare system, saying &quot;I think we should have 
single-payer medicine eventually&quot;. Munger repeated his sentiments in another interview, praising Singapore&#x27;s single-payer system in contrast to the U.S. &quot;insane&quot; system which is a &quot;national disgrace&quot;.

In his 50s, after a failed eye cataract surgery that rendered his left eye blind, Munger had his left eye removed due to severe pain. When doctors told him he had developed sympathetic ophthalmia, which could lead to blindness in his remaining eye, Munger started taking braille lessons. The eye condition eventually receded and he kept eyesight in his right eye for the rest of his life.

==Death==
Munger died at a hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on November 28, 2023, at the age of 99, 34 days shy of his 100th birthday. In the statement announcing his death, Warren Buffett said, &quot;Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie&#x27;s inspiration, wisdom and participation.&quot; Other prominent figures in the American business community who issued statements in Munger&#x27;s memory include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase Jamie Dimon, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio.

In the first annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s shareholders written after Munger&#x27;s death, Buffett gave a fuller account of his partner:Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never – &quot;never&quot; – reminded me of my mistake.

In the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those who had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire has become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction crew; &quot;Charlie&quot; should &quot;forever&quot; be credited with being the architect.

<text>John Archibald Campbell (June 24, 1811 – March 12, 1889) was an American jurist. He was a successful lawyer in Georgia and Alabama, where he served in the state legislature. Appointed by Franklin Pierce to the United States Supreme Court in 1853, he resigned at the beginning of the American Civil War, traveled south and became an official of the Confederate States of America. After serving six months in a military prison at war&#x27;s end, he secured a pardon and resumed his law practice in New Orleans, where he also opposed Reconstruction.

== Early life and education ==
Campbell was born near Washington, Wilkes County, Georgia to the former Mary Williamson and her husband, Col. Duncan Greene Campbell (for whom the now-defunct Campbell County, Georgia, was named). Col. Campbell had been born in North Carolina and attended college in Chapel Hill before moving to Wilkes County, Georgia and studying law under Judge John Griffin. An attorney, he also served as a trustee for many years of Franklin College, which his son attended, and which later became the University of Georgia. In 1824, while this boy was in college, President James Monroe appointed Duncan Campbell and another man to try to buy the land of the Creek Native Americans. His maternal grandfather was Lt. Col. Micajah Perry Williamson (1744-1796), who was born in Isle of Wight County, Virginia and became a trusted officer serving under General Elijah Clarke during the American Revolutionary War. He received 12,000 acres in Franklin County, Georgia for his Revolutionary War service and became a wealthy landowner in Wilkes County, including helping to lay out the county seat named after General Washington, and establishing the Wilkes Academy in 1797.

Considered a child prodigy, Campbell graduated from the University of Georgia in 1825 at the age of 14, and immediately enrolled at the United States Military Academy, where he studied for three years. He would have graduated in 1830, but withdrew upon hearing of his father&#x27;s death in July 1828 and returned home to Georgia.

While at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, on December 24–25, 1826, Campbell was involved in the Eggnog Riot (also known as the &quot;Grog Mutiny&quot;). Campbell was among 70 cadets that were involved, but a review concluded that only 20 cadets and one enlisted soldier should be charged. Court-martial proceedings ran from December 26, 1826, to March 16, 1827. On May 3, 1827, President John Quincy Adams adjusted some of the verdicts and approved the rest, so nine cadets were expelled. Other involved cadets included Jefferson Davis (involved but not charged), and Robert E. Lee (not involved but testified). Although some called for Campbell and classmate James W. M. &quot;Weems&quot; Berrien to be expelled, this was rejected.
Returning to Georgia, Campbell read law with his uncle, former Georgia governor John Clark, and was admitted to the bar in 1829, at the age of 18 which required a special act of the Georgia legislature.

== Personal life ==

== Alabama lawyer and legislator ==

In 1830, Campbell moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where he met and married Anna Esther Goldthwaite and earned a reputation as a talented lawyer specializing in Spanish land grant titles. Hailed as a war hero for his involvement in the Creek Indian War of 1836, Campbell was elected state representative for that same year&#x27;s term, firmly establishing himself as a Jacksonian Democrat in the state legislature. Thus Campbell aligned with Jackson on national policies, supporting the bank veto and condemning nullification, but he remained a moderate proponent of states&#x27; rights.

After his only term in office, Campbell and his young family (which eventually expanded to include five daughters and one son) relocated to Mobile, Alabama, and Campbell later served a second term as state representative in 1842. Fortunately for Campbell&#x27;s law career, though, Mobile was a bustling port city that constantly generated commercial lawsuits and Spanish grant disputes. In one such grant case, &quot;Mayor of Mobile v. Eslava&quot; (1849), Campbell revealed his states-rightist attitude and first articulated his doctrine of &quot;original sovereignty&quot; before the state supreme court. Briefly, Campbell argued that because each of the original 13 states had retained sovereignty over the navigable waters within its borders, and the Constitution makes all new states enter the Union on equal terms with existing states, new states like Alabama thus also retain sovereignty over their navigable waters. The Supreme Court upheld original sovereignty in an 1845 decision and Campbell would later refer to it in his &quot;Dred Scott&quot; concurrence. Thereafter, Campbell&#x27;s star continued to rise as one of the most sought-after attorneys in Alabama, and in 1852, he even acted as an attorney for Myra Clark Gaines against Richard Relf before the Supreme Court. In most cases, Campbell represented debtors against banks, demonstrating a Jacksonian Democratic tendency to advocate for state control of corporate development and champion the individual&#x27;s economic freedom. Twice, he turned down offers to sit on the Alabama Supreme Court, and on several occasions, he argued cases before the US Supreme Court.

During this successful early period as a lawyer, his political involvement also increased. From 1847 to 1851, for example, Campbell joined the national debate on slavery with the publication of four essays in the &quot;Southern Quarterly Review&quot; in which he called for improved conditions for slaves and gradual emancipation. Here, his theories and practices diverged: Campbell owned up to 14 slaves throughout his life, but he freed several before his Supreme Court appointment. Moreover, Campbell attended the Nashville Convention in 1850, where he helped compose a series of resolutions in reaction to the proposed Compromise of 1850. Although he drafted several of the final 13 resolutions in a conciliatory tone and never called for southern resistance, Campbell advocated the rights of slaveholders, condemned the free soil philosophy, and asserted the sole right of the states to regulate slavery within their borders.

== Supreme Court ==
=== Appointment ===

In 1852 the death of Justice John McKinley created a vacancy on the Supreme Court. President Millard Fillmore, a Whig, made three nominations to fill the vacancy, all of whom withdrew, declined to serve, or were not acted on by the Democratic-controlled Senate. After the election of Franklin Pierce, a Democrat, a group of sitting Supreme Court justices approached Pierce to recommend Campbell as a nominee; that is one of the few known times that sitting justices have made recommendations for new nominations. Pierce, who was hoping to stave off an insurrection by appeasing the South, agreed to nominate the Alabamian Campbell. The nomination was made on March 21, 1853, and even though Campbell was only 41 and had no previous judicial experience, the Senate unanimously approved the appointment within three days, including Northerners, who hoped that Campbell&#x27;s moderate tendencies would help overpower the growing sectionalism.

=== Constitutional contributions ===
Under the direction of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the Supreme Court weighed in on a number of important economic cases. In the 1837 case of &quot;Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge&quot;, for instance, Taney wrote the majority opinion, arguing for strict construction of corporate charters and effectively restraining the implications of the Marshall Court&#x27;s 1819 ruling in &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, which had recognized corporate charters as contracts under constitutional protection. Thereafter, the slight majority of Jacksonian Democrats on the bench became uneasy supporters of corporate privilege, bound to respect rights that were expressly granted in corporate charters and effectively limiting state control over intrastate internal improvements. Moreover, in 1844, the Taney Court had expanded upon the Marshall Court&#x27;s 1809 decision in &quot;Bank of the United States v. Deveaux&quot; and upheld in &quot;Louisville v. Letson&quot; (1844) that regardless of where its shareholders resided, a corporation could claim citizenship in the state of its incorporation and thereby bring suit to the federal court under diversity jurisdiction. Although the Taney Court quickly reversed the precedent in &quot;Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Transportation &amp; Railroad Company&quot; (1854) and ruled that corporations, in fact, derive their citizenship from their shareholders and not from the states themselves, diversity jurisdiction still applied to corporations.

Campbell refused to accept the Taney Court&#x27;s recent precedents on these corporate issues. His opinion in &quot;Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company&quot; marked his first major dissent, in which he clearly argued, &quot;a corporation is not a citizen. It may be an artificial person, a moral person, a judicial person, a legal entity, a faculty, an intangible, invisible being,&quot; but, he continued, quoting John Marshall, &quot;it certainly is not a citizen.&quot; Contesting corporate citizenship as the basis for diversity jurisdiction, Campbell further argued that corporations were not &quot;within the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution when they delegated jurisdiction over controversies between the citizens of different states&quot;. The Privileges and Immunities Clause (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 1), in other words, should not extend citizenship to corporations. Arguably, Campbell&#x27;s argument here, as well as in the dissenting opinions of fellow southern Justices John Catron and Peter V. Daniel, implicitly defended slavery. After all, if states could confer federal citizenship on corporations, then free blacks might also claim federal citizenship under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Later in his dissent, Campbell the Jacksonian Democrat also argued that the Court had encroached upon state powers by overextending federal jurisdiction in this case and that corporations themselves threaten states&#x27; internal powers. Explicitly, Campbell wrote, &quot;their [corporate] revenues and establishments mock at the frugal and stinted conditions of state administration; their pretensions and demands are sovereign, admitting impatiently interference by state legislative authority.&quot; If left unchecked by state legislatures and even protected by the national government, corporations threatened states&#x27; rights. In his first important case, then, Campbell took a hard stance against corporate privilege, defended states&#x27; rights, and arguably protected slavery.

In later cases, Campbell continued to fight corporate privilege by challenging Contract Clause protection of corporate charters. The following year, in fact, the Court heard &quot;Piqua Branch of the State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop&quot; (1854), a case which raised the question of whether a state legislature could change its taxation policy on corporations. Specifically, the Ohio General Banking Act of 1845 had provided that instead of paying taxes, each incorporated branch of the state bank would semiannually send six percent of its profits to the state. A subsequent 1851 law established a new taxing policy on banks. Ultimately, the Court ruled that the 1851 law had violated the Contract Clause because the 1845 law had constituted a contract between the state and a corporation of private shareholders. Campbell, again part of the southern faction with Justices Catron and Daniel, emphatically dissented. Early in this dissent, Campbell distinguished &quot;between the statutes which create hopes, expectations, faculties, conditions, and those which form contracts&quot;, ultimately arguing that the 1845 statute constituted the latter. Later, Campbell defended state power to legislate in the public&#x27;s best interest, explaining that this power is one &quot;which every department of government knows that the community is interested in retaining unimpaired and that every corporator understood its abandonment ought not to be presumed in a case in which the deliberate purpose to abandon it does not appear&quot;. State governments, according to Campbell, should be able to change their policies in order to keep pace with ever-evolving conditions; furthermore, banks and other corporations were not exempted from tax adjustments unless explicitly stated in the statute. Campbell clearly prioritized states&#x27; rights over corporate privilege.

The Court revisited this Ohio statute in two subsequent cases in the 1850s, and both times, Campbell issued thorough dissents. Leading up to the final case, &quot;Dodge v. Woolsey&quot; (1855), the Ohio state legislature had amended its constitution to end tax exemptions for banks before enacting a new bank tax law in 1852. When a shareholder of the bank brought suit once again, the Court&#x27;s majority, led by Justice James M. Wayne, maintained that even though the people of Ohio had amended their constitution, the 1845 bank act still constituted an inviolable contract. In his elaborate dissent, Campbell recounted the facts of the case, denied corporate citizenship yet again, and criticized the majority for expanding judicial power. Campbell warned that if a state should grant away its funds and powers to a corporation, then &quot;the most deliberate and solemn acts of the people would not serve to redress the injustice, and the overreaching speculator upon the facility or corruption of their legislature would be protected by the powers of this Court in the profits of his bargain.&quot; In other words, this decision bound the Supreme Court to protect corrupt corporations and legislatures against the warranted state constitutional amendments proposed by the people themselves. Furthermore, this collusion between the central government and corporate entities, Campbell cautioned, will &quot;establish on the soil of every state a caste made up of combinations of men for the most part under the most favorable conditions in society&quot;, eventually spawning &quot;a new element of alienation and discord between the different classes of society and the introduction of a fresh cause of disturbance in our distracted political and social system&quot;. Not only did corporations generate class conflict and threaten state sovereignty, argued the Jacksonian Democrat, but they also infringed upon individual liberties. After all, corporations &quot;display a love of power, a preference for corporate interests to moral or political principles or public duties, and an antagonism to individual freedom which have marked them as objects of jealousy in every epoch of their history&quot;. In short, Campbell did not consider a broad interpretation of the Contract Clause a sufficient justification for all of the potential evils of corporate entities. Instead, Campbell firmly believed that states should have direct control over corporate expansion.

Five years later, Campbell successfully persuaded the majority of the Court to agree with a narrower interpretation of the Contract Clause in the 1860 case of &quot;Christ&#x27;s Church Hospital v. County of Philadelphia&quot;. In 1833, the Pennsylvania legislature had granted a tax exemption to Christ&#x27;s Church Hospital, but in 1851, it enacted a tax upon all associations and corporations. Campbell concisely rejected the hospital&#x27;s claim that the 1833 tax exemption was perpetual, writing, &quot;such an interpretation is not to be favored, as the power of taxation is necessary to the existence of the State, and must be exerted according to the varying conditions of the Commonwealth.&quot; As he had been arguing since taking the bench, states need to be able to adapt to the times and therefore have the right to control corporate development within their borders.

As sectional tensions escalated in the late 1850s, the Court came to hear divisive slavery cases, including the notorious &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (1857). Attempting to settle the issue of slavery in the territories once and for all, Chief Justice Taney&#x27;s majority opinion forcefully asserted that blacks were not citizens and condemned the Missouri Compromise by declaring unconstitutional the federal regulation of slavery in the territories. Campbell issued a comprehensive concurring opinion. Although Campbell believed that the Court could not determine Scott&#x27;s citizenship status and refused to discuss this issue, he aligned with Taney in most other claims and offered a narrow interpretation of the Constitution. Namely, Campbell agreed that Scott remained a slave under Missouri law and therefore could not sue in federal court. He then dedicated the greater part of his opinion to disproving the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise, ultimately concluding that the Constitution&#x27;s Territories Clause (Article IV, Section 3) did not grant Congress the power to regulate slavery in the territories. To arrive at this conclusion, Campbell first asserted that Congress could not regulate slavery within existing states. After all, he wrote, &quot;it is a settled doctrine of this court that the Federal government can exercise no power over the subject of slavery within the States, nor control the intermigration of slaves, other than fugitives, among the States.&quot; And although the Territories Clause may grant Congress the authority to organize a government over public domain, it did not confer Congressional power to regulate municipal institutions, such as slavery, in the territories. Relying on his doctrine of original sovereignty, Campbell argued that such a clause permitting restrictive federal legislation would violate the innate sovereignty of the people in the territories, for when the people established their own state governments, these new states entered into the Union on equal footing with older states. Furthermore, if the framers had really envisioned Congressional regulation of slavery in the territories, then southern delegates at the Constitutional Convention would have vehemently protested. In his own words, &quot;the claim for Congress of supreme power in the Territories, under the grant to &#x27;dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting territory,&#x27; is not supported by the historical evidence drawn from the Revolution, the Confederation, or the deliberations which preceded the ratification of the Federal Constitution.&quot; As follows, the Territories Clause &quot;confers no power upon Congress to dissolve the relations of the master and slave on the domain of the United States, either within or without any of the States&quot;. In &quot;Dred Scott&quot;, Campbell clearly challenged what he considered to be an overextension of federal authority and advocated for territorial—and, by implication, state—self-government.

Despite his proslavery and states&#x27; rightist concurrence in &quot;Dred Scott&quot;, Campbell upset many of his fellow southerners while presiding over the Fifth Circuit. In 1854 and 1858, he had frustrated two separate filibustering efforts to acquire Cuba and then Nicaragua, thus prioritizing national neutrality policies over southern efforts to gain more slaveholding states.

== American Civil War ==
In March and April 1861, prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, Justice Campbell served as a mediator between three commissioners representing the Confederacy (Martin Crawford, Andre B. Roman, and John Forsyth Jr.), and the Lincoln administration. The commissioners indicated they were interested in preventing war if possible. Since President Lincoln denied that secession was valid, he refused any official contact with the Confederate commissioners, but Justice Campbell was permitted in their place.

On March 15, 1861, following the impassioned Senate speech of Stephen A. Douglas calling for the withdrawal of US forces from Confederate territory in order to ease tensions and prevent war, Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of State William H. Seward met with and assured Justice Campbell that Fort Sumter would be evacuated within ten days. Again on March 20, 1861, Campbell was assured by Seward of the Lincoln Administration&#x27;s intent to withdraw from the key military outpost. Due to a distrust of Seward, Campbell brought fellow Supreme Court Justice Samuel Nelson to this second meeting to act as a witness to Seward&#x27;s promise.

As feared by Campbell, on April 8 Lincoln reversed course by publicly stating he intended to resupply Fort Sumter either &quot;peacefully, or otherwise by force&quot;. This resupply mission resulted in the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter, Lincoln&#x27;s proclamation of a state of rebellion and the start of the war.

As a result, Campbell resigned from the Supreme Court on April 30, 1861, and returned south. He was the only southern justice to do so. Threatened with lynching and effectively banished from Alabama for his moderate views, opposition to secession, and attempt at mediation, Campbell settled in New Orleans. A year and a half later, in October 1862, he was appointed Confederate Assistant Secretary of War by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. He held that position through the end of the war.

Since Campbell served the Confederacy after his role as mediator, Lincoln&#x27;s private secretary and subsequent biographer John G. Nicolay, ascribed ill motives to Campbell in that he &quot;came to Seward in the guise of a loyal official, though his correspondence with Jefferson Davis soon revealed a treasonable intent&quot;. However, even when serving the Confederacy, Campbell still advocated for peace.

Justice Campbell was one of the three Confederate Peace Commissioners (along with Alexander H. Stephens and Robert M. T. Hunter), who met with Abraham Lincoln and William H. Seward in 1865 at the Hampton Roads Conference in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate an end to the Civil War.

== Postbellum ==
=== Federal detention ===
On April 14, 1865, five days after the war ended, Lincoln was assassinated. Having previously met with Lincoln as a member of the Confederacy, Campbell was loosely suspected in the assassination. He was arrested on May 30, 1865, and was held in federal detention at Fort Pulaski, Georgia, for the next five months. Campbell was never formally charged. Former colleagues and Supreme Court Justices Benjamin R. Curtis and Samuel Nelson intervened on Campbell&#x27;s behalf, and he was released in October 1865.

=== Legal career ===
At the end of the war, Campbell was not able to immediately practice law. Due to laws passed by Congress, attorneys who had aided the Confederacy were prohibited from practicing law in Federal Court. In &quot;Ex parte Garland&quot; this law was held to be unconstitutional and Campbell was able to get back to work. He was again recognized as one of the nation&#x27;s most competent attorneys and became so busy that he argued only cases brought before the U.S. Supreme Court. Campbell argued (but lost) the noted Slaughterhouse Case, representing a group of butchers who suffered business losses due to a Louisiana law which limited slaughterhouses to a single location in New Orleans. He argued that the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Privileges or Immunities Clause guaranteed the butchers&#x27; right to practice an otherwise lawful trade. However, Campbell lost the case. The Supreme Court held that the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment protected nothing more than a limited set of pre-existing federal rights, and did not include the right to pursue a trade. The result stood for decades. Some believe that had the court adopted Campbell&#x27;s argument, federal civil rights would have been extended to the states decades earlier.

Campbell was a member of the &quot;Committee of One Hundred&quot; that went to Washington to persuade President Grant to end his support of what they called the &quot;Kellogg usurpation&quot;. Grant had sent troops to support Governor William Pitt Kellogg of Louisiana. Grant initially refused to meet them but later relented; he did not, however, change his position on the matter.

=== Death ===
Campbell died on March 12, 1889, in Baltimore, Maryland. He is interred at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.

== Legacy and honors ==
During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Brunswick, Georgia, and named in his honor.
The John Archibald Campbell United States Courthouse was built in Mobile, Alabama in 1934. He is also the namesake for the Federal Building next door, built during the Richard Nixon Administration.

<text>Wesco Financial Corporation was an American diversified financial corporation headquartered in Pasadena, California. Wesco was originally the holding company for Mutual Savings, a savings and loan association. Mutual Savings&#x27; thrift operations were sold to CenFed Bank in 1993. It was for a long time 80.1% owned by Blue Chip Stamps, which is now completely and fully owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which is controlled by legendary investor Warren Buffett. Charlie Munger, the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett&#x27;s business partner, was CEO and chairman of Wesco from 1984 to 2011. Munger, formerly a practicing attorney, is known for his straight-shooting style and his conduct at the now discontinued Wesco shareholder meetings in Pasadena, where he used to interact with the outside investors at considerable length. In June 2011, Berkshire Hathaway acquired the approximately 20% of Wesco that it did not already own, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of that company.

Wesco Financial was previously likened to a miniature version of Berkshire Hathaway by certain observers, although Buffett and Munger cautioned investors that this was not an appropriate comparison. Like its parent company, Wesco provided insurance and reinsurance; it does so through subsidiaries Wesco-Financial Insurance Company and Kansas Bankers Surety. It also held shares in some of the same companies as Berkshire, like Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Wells Fargo. Controlling interests include CORT Business Services and Precision Steel Warehouse, which has steel service centers in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.

==Subsidiaries==
Wesco did business in three major categories; insurance, furniture rental, and steel service. The following wholly owned subsidiaries handled most of Wesco&#x27;s business:
* Wesco-Financial Insurance, which was incorporated in 1985 and engages in the property and casualty insurance business. Wesco-Financial became part of National Indemnity.
* Kansas Bankers Surety Company, which was incorporated in 1909, purchased by Wesco in 1996 and provides specialized insurance coverages for banks. Kansas Bankers Surety became part of Berkshire Hathaway Companies.
* CORT Business Services Corporation, furniture rental.
* Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc., a chain of steel service centers. Precision Steel was founded in 1940 and acquired by Wesco in 1979.
* MS Property Company, which owns commercial real estate in Pasadena.

<text>IMAGE is a database management system (DBMS) developed by Hewlett-Packard and included with the HP 3000 minicomputer. It was the primary reason for that platform&#x27;s success in the market. It was also sometimes referred to as IMAGE/3000 in its initial release, and later versions were known as TurboIMAGE, and TurboIMAGE/XL after the PA-RISC migration.

IMAGE is based on the network database model, in contrast to most modern systems which are based on the relational database model. A SQL (Structured Query Language) front-end processor was later added, offering users the ability to run SQL queries on existing databases. This produced IMAGE/SQL, the current name.
==Overview==
IMAGE consists of several utilities along with an API (referred to as &quot;intrinsics&quot; by the HP documentation):

* DBSCHEMA - Compile a source schema layout. The source layout describes the tables (known as SETS) and columns (known as FIELDS).
* DBUTIL - Creates and performs maintenance functions on the database.
* QUERY - Generalized query tool for accessing any TurboIMAGE database.

The following is a sample list of the API calls used for application development. These calls are supported by HP&#x27;s compilers: COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, SPL, PASCAL and C.

* DBFIND - Locates a record.
* DBGET - Retrieves a record.
* DBPUT - Adds a record.
* DBUPDATE - Updates a record.
* DBINFO - Provides information on the structure of the database.
* DBOPEN - Opens the database with a specified password to provide access rights to the application.

==History==
The significant highlights of IMAGE are:

* Originally released as IMAGE/3000 around 1972 as a $10,000 option, but later included free as part of the MPE operating system.
* Bundled with the HP Precision Architecture RISC Computers along with HP ALLBASE/SQL, a Relational DBMS, on the MPE/XL operating system.
* Several Fourth-generation programming language products (Powerhouse, Transact, Speedware, Protos) became available from third party vendors.
* New capabilities were added including the increase of storage capacity and increase of several internal limitations such as the number of SETS allowed in a database. IMAGE/3000 was renamed TurboIMAGE due to these new capabilities.
* HP provided a Third Party Interface (TPI) to DISC&#x27;s OMNIDEX and Bradmark&#x27;s SUPERDEX products.
* HP announced the end of life for the HP3000 which included TurboIMAGE.
* Marxmeier released Eloquence which is schema and API compatible with TurboIMAGE and allows TurboIMAGE applications to run on Microsoft Windows and HP-UX.
* Stromasys released an HP3000 emulator allowing TurboIMAGE applications to be run on commodity hardware.

<doc id="912103" wikidata="Q502535" url="?curid=912103" title="Morna (music)">
<text>The morna (pronunciation in both Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole: ) is a music and dance genre from Cape Verde. It was proclaimed Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO on December 11, 2019.

Lyrics are usually in Cape Verdean Creole, and instrumentation often includes cavaquinho, clarinet, accordion, violin, piano and guitar.

Morna is widely considered the national music of Cape Verde, as is the fado for Portugal, the tango for Argentina, the merengue for Dominican Republic, the rumba for Cuba, and so on.

The best internationally known morna singer was Cesária Évora. Morna and other genres of Cape Verdean music are also played in Cape Verdean migrant communities abroad, especially in New England in the US, Portugal, the Netherlands, France, West Africa and parts of Latin America.

== As a music genre ==
As a music genre, the morna is characterized by having a lento tempo, a 2-beat bar (sometimes 4) and in its most traditional form by having a harmonic structure based on a cycle of fifths, while the lyrics structure is organized by musical strophes that alternate with a refrain. The morna is almost always monotonic, i.e., it is composed in just one tonality. Compositions that use more than one tonality are rare and generally they are cases of passing from a minor to major tonality or vice versa.

=== Harmonic structure ===
In its most traditional form, the morna obeys a cycle of fifths. The harmonic progression starts in a chord (the tonic) of a certain tonality, the second chord is the lower fifth (the subdominant), the third chord is the same as the first and the fourth chord is the upper fifth (the dominant seventh). These chords — tonic, dominant seventh, subdominant — have in Cape Verde the popular names of “primeira”, “segunda” and “terceira” (first, second and third) respectively of the tonality in question. For example, if the music is being performed in an A minor tonality, the A minor chord has the name “primeira de Lá menor” (A minor&#x27;s first), the E 7th chord has the name of “segunda de Lá menor” (A minor&#x27;s second) and the D minor chord has the name of “terceira de Lá menor” (A minor&#x27;s third).

However, this structure corresponds to the most basic and most primary harmonic sequence of the morna. First, this structure has been enriched later with the so-called passing chords (see below under History). Second, this structure is by no means mandatory. Several composers, specially recent composers, employ different chord progressions.

=== Melodic structure ===

The melodic line of the morna varies a lot through the song, with ascending and descending note sequences, and within a bar the notes generally do not have the same length. One frequent characteristic of the morna is the syncopation, more precisely, one note at the end of a bar is extended to the strong beat of the next bar. The melody is accentuated on the first beat and the last half-beat of the bar.

The melody is structured in verses that in turn are organized in strophes. The main strophes alternate with a refrain strophe, and this alternation can have several models: ABABAB..., ABCBABCB..., ACBACB..., AABCCB..., etc. The melody of the refrain is never the same as the melody of the other strophes.

=== Themes ===
The theme of the morna is varied, but there are certain subjects that are approached with more frequency. Besides universal subjects like love, typically Cape Verdean subjects are talked about, such as departure abroad, the return, the saudade, love for the homeland and the sea. One of the great performers responsible for this thematic was the poet/composer Eugénio Tavares who introduced in the beginning of the 20th century the lyricism and the exploration of typical romanticism still used today.

=== Instrumentation ===
The main instrument associated with the morna is the guitar, popularly called “violão” in Cape Verde. In its most simple form, a guitar is enough to provide the accompaniment for another solo instrument that can be another guitar, a violin (popularly called “rabeca” in Cape Verde), the singer&#x27;s voice or any other melodic instrument. The specific way of strumming the strings in a guitar is popularly called “mãozada” in Cape Verde. The strumming of the morna articulates a bass (played with the thumb, marking the accentuation of the rhythm) with chords (played with the other fingers, either in an arpeggio, rhythmically, or in a combination of both). The morna can also be performed on a piano, with the left hand providing the bass and the accompaniment and the right hand providing the accompaniment and the melody.

The composition of a morna band is not rigid. A medium-sized band may have, besides the aforementioned guitar, a cavaquinho (that plays the chords rhythmically), a ten or twelve string guitar (popularly called “viola” in Cape Verde, that provides an harmonic support), a solo instrument besides the singer&#x27;s voice and some percussion instrument. A bigger band may have another guitar, an acoustic bass guitar, more than one solo instrument (violin, clarinet, trumpet, etc.) and several percussion instruments (shaker, güiro, bongos, etc.).

From the 1960s, morna began electrification, with the percussion instruments being replaced by a drum kit and the bass / accompaniment play performed on the guitar replaced by a bass guitar and an electric guitar. In the late 1990s, there was a return to the roots with unplugged (acoustic) performances sought after again.

In its most traditional form, the song starts with an introduction played on the solo instrument (this introduction generally being the same melody as the refrain) and then the song develops in an alternation between the main strophes and the refrain. Approximately after the middle of the song, instead of the sung refrain, the solo instrument performs an improvisation. Recent composers, however, do not always use this sequence.

== As a dance ==
As a dance the morna is a ballroom dance, danced in pairs. The performers dance with an arm embracing the partner, while with the other arm they hold hands. The dancing is made through two body swings to one side in a music&#x27;s bar, while in the next bar the swinging is to the other side.

== History ==
The history of the morna can be divided into several periods, not always agreed among scholars:

=== 1st period: origins ===
It is not known for sure when and where the morna appeared. The oral tradition gives it for certain that the morna appeared in the Boa Vista Island in the 18th century, but there are no musicological records to prove this. But when Alves dos Reis says that, during the 19th century, with the invasion of polkas, mazurkas, galops, country dances and other musical genres in Cape Verde, the morna was not influenced, it suggests that by that time the morna was already a fully formed and mature musical genre.

Even so, some authors trace the origins of the morna back to a musical genre — the lundum — that would have been introduced into Cape Verde in the 18th century. There is also a relationship between the morna and another musical genre that existed already in the islands, the choros, which are plaintive songs performed on certain occasions, such as the working songs and wake songs. The morna would be, then, a cross between the choros and the lundum, with a slower tempo and a more complex harmonic structure. Some authors claim that speeding up the tempo of some older songs from Boa Vista or even the song “Força di cretcheu” from Eugénio Tavares, produces something very close to the lundum.

From Boa Vista, this new musical genre would have gradually spread to the other islands. At that time, the morna did not have the romantic thematic that it has today, nor the noble character that it was given later.

Musicologists cite the morna &quot;Brada Maria&quot; as the composition with the longest documented provenance, composed around 1870.

The origin of the word “morna” for this musical genre is uncertain. However, there are three theories, each with its supporters and detractors.

For some, the word comes from English “to mourn”. For others the word comes from French “morne”, the name given to hills in the French Antilles, where the chansons des mornes are sung. But to most of the people the word “morna” would correspond to the feminine of the Portuguese word “” (warm) clearly alluding to the sweet and plaintive character of the morna.

=== 2nd period: Eugénio Tavares ===
In the beginning of the 20th century, the poet Eugénio Tavares was one of the main people responsible for giving morna the romantic character that it has today. In the Brava island the morna underwent some transformation, acquiring a slower tempo than the Boa Vista morna, the poetry became more lyricised with themes focusing mostly on love and feelings provoked by love.

=== 3rd period: B. Leza ===
In the 1930s and the 1940s, the morna gained special characteristics in São Vicente. The Brava style was much appreciated and cultivated in all Cape Verde by that time (there are records about E. Tavares being received in apotheosis in S. Vicente island and even the Barlavento composers wrote in Sotavento Creole, probably because the maintenance of the unstressed vowels in Sotavento Creoles gave more musicality). But specific conditions in S. Vicente such as the cosmopolitanism and openness to foreign influences brought some enrichment to the morna.

One of the main people responsible for this enrichment was the composer Francisco Xavier da Cruz (a.k.a. B.Leza) who under Brazilian music influence introduced the so-called passing chords, popularly known as “meio-tom brasileiro” (Brazilian half-tone) in Cape Verde. Thanks to these passing chords, the harmonic structure of the morna was not restrained to the cycle of fifths, but incorporated other chords that made the smooth transition to the main ones.

As an example, a song in a C major tonality could be enriched in this way:

Another example, but in an A minor tonality:

Although it looks simple, this introduction has left its deep mark on the morna and passed through later to the coladeira.

Another innovation is that this period slightly coincides with the literary movement Claridade, and consequently the thematic was widened to include not only themes related to the Romanticism bat also related to the Realism.

=== 4th period: the 1950s to the 1970s ===
In this period a new musical genre, the coladeira, reached its maturity and a lot of composers tried this novelty. Therefore, the years from the 1950s to the 1970s did not bring big innovations in musical techniques to the morna.

However, some compositions with a “subtle and sentimental melodic trait” came up, and if movement against the Portuguese colonial policy began, in the morna it is made discretely with the thematic widening to include lyrics praising the homeland or beloved people in the homeland. The lyrics were also inspired by other music (bolero, samba-canção, American songs, chanson française, etc.). In the 1970s, there were even political songs.

In the 1960s, electric instruments began to be used and the morna began to be known internationally, either by performances abroad or records production.

=== 5th period: recent years ===
Recent composers take advantage of more artistic freedom to give to the morna unusual characteristics. More recent mornas hardly follow the cycle of fifths scheme, there is a great freedom in chord sequences, the musical strophes do not always have a rigid number of verses, in the melody the reminiscences of the lundum have practically disappeared, and some composers try fusing the morna with other musical genres.

== Variants ==

=== Boa Vista morna ===
The Boa Vista morna is the oldest variant of the morna. It is characterized by having a quicker tempo (andante ± 96 bpm) and a rubato style, and by being structurally simpler. The themes often talk about jokes, satires or social criticism. The melody accentuation is very close to the lundum.

=== Brava morna ===
The Brava morna is in the origin of the most known variety of &quot;morna&quot; today. Besides having a slower tempo than the Boa Vista morna (lento ± 60 bpm), it has typical Romanticism characteristics, such as the use of rhymes, an accentuated lyricism and a more rigid metre. The Brava style is still practiced by composers from Brava and Fogo.

=== São Vicente morna ===
The São Vicente morna is a derivative of the Brava morna. Both have the same tempo, but in the S. Vicente morna, the chord sequences have been enriched with the passing chords. The thematic has also been widened to include not only romantic themes and the poetry is not so rigid. Neither makes use of rhymes like the Brava morna.

Departing from the S. Vicente morna, one can witness from more recent and innovative composers to some other morna variants that have not been systemized yet.

<text>A basal body (synonymous with basal granule, kinetosome, and in older cytological literature with blepharoplast) is a protein structure found at the base of a eukaryotic undulipodium (cilium or flagellum). The basal body was named by Theodor Wilhelm Engelmann in 1880. It is formed from a centriole and several additional protein structures, and is, essentially, a modified centriole. The basal body serves as a nucleation site for the growth of the axoneme microtubules. Centrioles, from which basal bodies are derived, act as anchoring sites for proteins that in turn anchor microtubules, and are known as the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). These microtubules provide structure and facilitate movement of vesicles and organelles within many eukaryotic cells.

== Assembly, structure ==

Cilia and basal bodies form during quiescence or the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Before the cell enters G1 phase, i.e. before the formation of the cilium, the mother centriole serves as a component of the centrosome.

In cells that are destined to have only one primary cilium, the mother centriole differentiates into the basal body upon entry into G1 or quiescence. Thus, the basal body in such a cell is derived from the centriole. 
The basal body differs from the mother centriole in at least two aspects. First, basal bodies have basal feet, which are anchored to cytoplasmic microtubules and are necessary for polarized alignment of the cilium. Second, basal bodies have pinwheel-shaped transition fibers that originate from the appendages of mother centriole.

In multiciliated cells, however, in many cases basal bodies are not made from centrioles but are generated &quot;de novo&quot; from a special protein structure called the deuterosome.

== Function ==

During cell cycle dormancy, basal bodies organize primary cilia and reside at the cell cortex in proximity to plasma membrane. On cell cycle entry, cilia resorb and the basal body migrates to the nucleus where it functions to organize centrosomes. Centrioles, basal bodies, and cilia are important for mitosis, polarity, cell division, protein trafficking, signaling, motility and sensation.

Mutations in proteins that localize to basal bodies are associated with several human ciliary diseases, including Bardet–Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, Joubert syndrome, cone-rod dystrophy, Meckel syndrome, and nephronophthisis.

Regulation of basal body production and spatial orientation is a function of the nucleotide-binding domain of γ-tubulin.

Plants lack centrioles and only lower plants (such as mosses and ferns) with motile sperm have flagella and basal bodies.

<text>Denis ApIvor (14 April 191627 May 2004) was a British composer, best known for his ballet score &quot;Blood Wedding&quot;. He had a parallel career as a consultant anaesthetist.

==Biography==
ApIvor (pronounced Ap Ivor) was born in Collinstown, County Westmeath, Ireland, to Welsh parents, Denis ApIvor went to Hereford Cathedral School and was a chorister at Christ Church, Oxford, and Hereford Cathedral. Because his parents opposed a career in music, he studied medicine in London, but had also pursued the study of music from an early age. He began his medical studies at the University of Aberystwyth in 1933, moving the next year to University College London. Inspired by hearing the first performance in England of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, 14 March 1934 conducted by Adrian Boult) and encouraged by Cecil Gray, he also studied composition privately with Patrick Hadley and Alan Rawsthorne.

At the outbreak of World War II he was for a time house physician at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Hampstead. In 1942 he was called up, mostly serving as a war doctor in India. After the war ApIvor continued with his medical career, eventually retiring in 1979 from the Mid Kent Group.

But he also returned to his musical activities. He formed a friendship with his Albany Street neighbour Constant Lambert, who conducted the premiere of his first major work, a choral-orchestral setting of T S Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;, on 21 February, 1950. His diverse musical influences during this period ranged from Busoni, Delius, Peter Warlock and Bernard van Dieren to Berg and Webern.

The 1950s and 1960s were his most productive years, but despite a decline in performances from the 1970s he continued to compose into the 1990s and beyond. He left London to live in Wales in 1987 and in the 1990s moving to Telscombe, near Brighton. He died in Robertsbridge, Sussex, aged 88.

==Music==
ApIvor&#x27;s music falls broadly into three periods: early works from the 1950s influenced by Van Dieren and Peter Warlock, soon leading to a stricter serial style until the late 1980s, and finally renewed simplicity in his later works.

His most successful early works include &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; (1939; rev. 1946), and several ballets. &quot;A Mirror for Witches&quot; (1951), based on the book by Esther Forbes with choreography by Andrée Howard and set designs by Norman Adams, was premiered on 4 March 1952 with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet at the Royal Opera House. It was followed in 1953 by &quot;Blood Wedding&quot;, choreographed by Alfred Rodrigues, designs by Isabel Lambert. This Lorca-inspired work achieved international success, with staged productions from Turkey to Chile. It led to the commissioning by Sadler&#x27;s Wells of the opera &quot;Yerma&quot; (1955–59). When this was shelved as being too difficult, William Glock asked Eugene Goossens to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra and chorus in a broadcast concert performance in 1961. Glock also commissioned the televised ballet &quot;Corporal Jan&quot; in 1968. 

While ApIvor introduced serial elements in his Piano Concerto (1948, revised 1954 and performed at the Proms in 1958 by Patrick Piggott), it was only in 1955 that he began regularly using a more freely atonal and athematic serialism, which he continued to do until the 1980s. He was influenced in this by Edward Clark, a conductor, former BBC music producer, student of Arnold Schoenberg and husband of Elisabeth Lutyens.

He composed five symphonies, various concertos (for cello, guitar, horn, piano and violin), and many chamber and instrumental works, including three string quartets. He made a major contribution to the guitar repertoire: solo works include &quot;Variations&quot; (1958), &quot;Discanti&quot; (1970), &quot;Saeta&quot; (1972), and ten serial pieces included with his book &quot;Serial Composition for Guitarists&quot; (1982). He also wrote a Concertino for guitar (1954), &quot;Liaison&quot; for guitar and keyboard (1976), and &quot;Cinquefoil&quot; for flute, guitar, and viola (1984).

Composer David Hackbridge Johnson has noted &quot;a less aphoristic approach to serialism&quot; in later works, with the expressive and melodic qualities of the Cello Concerto (1977) foreshadowing the modal works of his final years, such as the String Quartet No 3 (1989-90). His &quot;Fantasy Concertante&quot; (1979-80) for horn was broadcast by soloist Frank Lloyd with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Nicholas Kraemer in 1996. His final work was an operatic scena &quot;The Trixter&quot; (2002), setting a poem by Peter Warlock. Archival material relating to ApIvor can be accessed at the National Library of Wales and a full set of his scores are held at The University of Leeds.

<text>Roland Mark Schoeman OIS (born 4 July 1980) is a South African American swimmer who attended the University of Arizona, was a world record holder in multiple events, and was a member of the South African swimming team at the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games. He won a gold medal representing South Africa in the 4x100 freestyle relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics and between 2000-2014 won numerous medals including seven golds in freestyle, and butterfly events at the World Championships, Pan American, and Commonwealth games. Following his swimming career in May 2022, he officially became a citizen of the United States.

==Early life and overview==
Born in Pretoria on July 4, 1980, Schoeman first took an interest in the sport when he was 13, and began to compete three years later. He said he began swimming only to impress a girl he met. He attended Pretoria&#x27;s Willow Ridge High School, where he trained under coach Gavin Ross. In 1998, shortly before beginning college at the University of Arizona, he finished sixth in the 50 and 100 meter freestyles at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lampur. In his career he would attain a gold, silver and bronze medal at the 2004 Olympic Games; three gold, a silver and a bronze medal in the World Championships, as well as four gold, three silvers and three bronzes at the Commonwealth Games. He set new South African records in the 100 m Freestyle (48.69 s), 50 m Freestyle (22.04 s), 100 m Butterfly (52.73 s) and 50 m Butterfly (23.65 s) events.

===University of Arizona===
Schoeman attended the University of Arizona on a swimming scholarship between 1998-2002, where he was coached by ASCAA Hall of Fame Coach Frank Busch and Assistant Coach Rick DeMont. Coach DeMont also served as a primary coach for Schoeman&#x27;s South African Team at the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Olympics. As a collegiate swimmer at the University of Arizona, DeMont had held world records in both the 400-meter and 1500-meter freestyle, and excelled at middle and long distance freestyle events, making him a skilled mentor for advancing Schoeman&#x27;s freestyle technique.

In 2000, at the NCAA Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Championships in Minnesota, while swimming as a Sophomore, Schoeman tied the short course world record in the 50-meter freestyle with a time of 21.31. While at Arizona in 2002, he again won the NCAA Championship in the 50-meter freestyle, in addition to capturing several runner-up finishes and multiple All-American honors. Roland would later became the first person ever to record a time of less than 21 seconds in the 50 meter freestyle.

==2000-2012 Olympics==
Schoeman competed for South Africa in the 2000 Sydney Olympics in the 50-meter freestyle placing eleventh and the 100 meter freestyle event placing fifteenth, as well as the 4x100 meter freestyle relay where his team placed eleventh.

===Three 2004 Olympic medals===
Schoeman won three medals at the 2004 Olympics, making him the first South African to win three medals in one Olympics. He won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m freestyle. He captured the silver medal in the 100 m freestyle event recording a time of 48.23. Schoeman and South African teamate Neethling led in the first half of the 100 meter event, but Pieter Van Den Hoogenband of the Netherlands had a strong finish to defend his title and take the gold medal. Schoeman won a bronze in the 50 m freestyle with a time of 22.02 in a typically close finish. Though leading in the early portion of the 50-meter event, Schoeman faded to third place, finishing only .08 seconds behind the unexpected second place silver medalist, Duje Draganja of Croatia. 

In his most memorable event at the 2004 games, Schoeman helped South Africa upset the Netherlands and the dominant United States in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay, an historic upset. The 2004 4x100 meter Olympic gold medal South African relay team consisted of Schoeman, Lyndon Ferns, Darian Townsend, and Ryk Neethling. As one of the events faster swimmers, Schoeman&#x27;s opening leg in the 4x100 freestyle relay opened up a lead that remained throughout the race defeating the second place Netherlands teams by a second and defeating the United States team which took the bronze. Ryk Neethling swam the fastest time of the South African 4x100 relay team in the final heat and insured the South African win, despite a close finish. 

At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Schoeman participated in the 50-meter freestyle and the 4x100 meter freestyle relay finishing seventh in both events.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Schoeman, aged 32, advanced to the finals in the men&#x27;s 50 m freestyle though he finished sixth, clocking a 21.80 in the finals to finish 0.46 seconds behind the gold medal winner, Florent Manaudou.

In 2016, Schoeman missed qualifying for a fifth Olympics.

===2006 Commonwealth games===
Three of the Men&#x27;s 4x100 metre Freestyle team at the 2004 Olympics were in the team that broke the record and won gold at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. He also claimed golds at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in the 100m freestyle and 100m butterfly.

===Records===
Schoeman was the former individual world record holder in the Long Course Meters 50 butterfly, Short Course Meters 50 freestyle, Short Course Meters 100 freestyle, and Short Course Meters 100 individual medley. On 6 September 2008, Schoeman set a new short course meters (25 m pool) world record of 20.64 for a 50-meter swim at South African Nationals. He lost his world record in late 2008 but regained it in August 2009. At the South Africa Short Course Championships, Schoeman recorded a time of 20.30 seconds for the 50-meter event, which was broken in 2014 by Florent Manaudou. Overall, Schoeman has broken three long course world records with two individual, and one relay, and six individual short course world records.

===2001, 2005, 2007 World Aquatic Championships===
Schoeman won a bronze in the 50 meter freestyle at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships. 

At the 2005 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada he won two gold medals [50 m Butterfly (in a world record time of 22.96 s) and Freestyle (21.69 s, the second fastest time in history at the time). He also claimed a silver in 100 m freestyle.

At the 2007 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne Australia he successfully defended his 50m butterfly title. He also made the final of the 50 m and 100 m freestyle and was part of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team that finished fourth.

In December 2005, he turned down a 40 Million Rand (US$5.9 million) contract to swim for Qatar. He turned down the offer due to his own national pride and because he felt the sound of the South African national anthem and the experience of sharing pride in his victories with other citizens of South Africans is what made winning gold special.

After his elite swimming career ended, he competed in the 1 Mile Flowers Sea Swim at the Cayman Islands in June 2018, finishing with a time of 24:05.

As of 2023, he was part of the Enhanced Games athletes advisory commission. The Enhanced Games are a multi-sport event, that have a more relaxed policy toward drug testing. They were founded by Australian businessman Aron D&#x27;Souza, and planning for their first event in 2025.


==Honors==
Schoeman, who is asthmatic, was voted the African Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World in 2004, 2005 and 2006; and the South African Swimmer of the Year in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. He was elected South African Sports Star of the Year in 2004.

In 2007, he received the South African Presidential Award Order of Ikhamanga in Silver, awarded for excellent achievements in the field of swimming.

In 2004 he was inducted into the University of Pretoria Sport Hall of fame.

In 2007 he was inducted into the University of Arizona Sports Hall of Fame.

In August, 2024, he was inducted into the South Africa Sports Hall of Fame, along with the three other swimmers who won the gold medal in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

<doc id="912120" wikidata="Q931887" url="?curid=912120" title="Tie Your Mother Down">
<text>&quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by lead guitarist Brian May. It is the opening track and the second single from their 1976 album &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. On its original release as a single in 1977 the song peaked at 31 in the UK Singles Chart. More than 20 years later, it was released as a double a-side to &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot; where it reached 13 in UK Singles Chart. On the album the song is preceded by a one-minute instrumental intro featuring a Shepard tone melody, performed by Brian May, which is reprised in the ending of &quot;Teo Torriatte&quot;: this was intended to create a &quot;circle&quot; within the album.

After its release in 1976, it was played by Queen on every subsequent tour. At the 1992 The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, the song was co-performed by Queen and guests Joe Elliott and Slash. On several occasions in recent years, Brian May and Roger Taylor have played the song live with the Foo Fighters, including performances at Queen&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2001, and the VH1 Rock Honors in 2006.

==History==
Brian May started writing the song in Tenerife, while he was working for his PhD as an astrophysicist. He composed the riff on a Spanish guitar, and woke up one morning and played it while singing &quot;tie your mother down,&quot; a line he considered a joke. Vocalist Freddie Mercury encouraged him to keep the line. &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; opens with an ultra-heavy, stripped down guitar riff.

A promotional film was made for the song, directed by Bruce Gowers, based on a performance clip shot at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York in February 1977 during the band&#x27;s US arena headlining tour.

Though it was a long-time live favourite and a US FM rock radio favourite, the song had limited chart success, making #31 in the UK and #49 in the US. Therefore, it was included on the band&#x27;s first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation in certain markets only; however, the song is featured on the &quot;Queen Rocks&quot; compilation album, together with some of the band&#x27;s heaviest songs.

In a BBC Radio 4 tribute program to Rory Gallagher, May stated that a key inspiration for the riff of this song came from Taste&#x27;s &quot;Morning Sun&quot; from their &quot;On the Boards&quot; (1970) album.

==Queen comments on the song==


==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it &quot;explodes with thunder bolts of electric guitar that few other groups can equal.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;a no holds barred rocker&quot; in which &quot;the harmonies remain ever present.&quot;

==Live performances==
After its release in 1976, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; would go on to become the most frequent opening number for the remainder of the band&#x27;s long career. At the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, the song was co-performed by Queen and guests; Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott and Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash. May sang the first verse and chorus before handing over the vocal part to Elliot. On several occasions in the recent years, May and Taylor have played this song live with the Foo Fighters, including performances at Queen&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2001, VH1 Rock Honors 2006, and in Foo Fighters London Hyde Park concert for the encore of the show. On 5 September 2011, Jeff Beck performed the song with May and Taylor in celebration of what would have been Freddie Mercury&#x27;s 65th birthday at an event titled &#x27;Freddie for a Day&#x27; held at the Savoy Hotel in London.

<text>Business Basic is a category of variants of the BASIC computer programming language which were specialised for business use on minicomputers in the 1970s and 1980s. To the underlying BASIC language, these dialects added record handling instructions similar to those in COBOL, allowing programmers to build complex file-handling applications using what was at that time a much more modern programming language. MAI Systems released the first example as MAI Basic Four in 1972, and several similar versions emerged through the 1970s.

Business Basics added indexed file access methods to the normal set of BASIC commands, and were optimised for other input/output access, especially display terminal control. The two major families of Business Basic are Basic/Four and Data General Business Basic. In addition, the Point 4 company, which developed the IRIS operating system, had their own version of BASIC. The UniBASIC owned by Dynamic Concepts of Irvine is a derivative of the Point 4 BASIC.

In the 1980s, Business Basics were ported from their original proprietary environments to many Unix platforms, CP/M, and to DOS. In the 1990s, some Business Basics were ported to Linux and Windows, and Business Basic integrated development environments became available. Notably, in 1990 MAI&#x27;s version was ported from their BOSS operating system to become the multi-platform Open BASIC.

Business Basic continues to be widely used due to the very large base of application software.

<doc id="912128" wikidata="Q547502" url="?curid=912128" title="Microsome">
<text>In cell biology, microsomes are heterogeneous vesicle-like artifacts (~20-200 nm diameter) re-formed from pieces of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when eukaryotic cells are broken-up in the laboratory; microsomes are not present in healthy, living cells.

Rough (containing ribosomes) and smooth (without ribosomes) microsomes are made from the endoplasmic reticulum through cell disruption. These microsomes have an inside that is exactly the same as the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Both forms of microsomes can be purified by a process known as equilibrium density centrifugation. Rough and smooth microsomes do differ in their proteins and rough microsomes have shown occurrence of translation and translocation at the same time besides certain exceptions from proteins in yeast.

== Signal Hypothesis ==
The Signal Hypothesis was postulated by Günter Blobel and David Sabatini in 1971, stating that a unique peptide sequence is encoded by mRNA specific for proteins destined for translocation across the ER membrane. This peptide signal directs the active ribosome to the membrane surface and creates the conditions for transfer of the nascent polypeptide across the membrane. The generalization of the Signal Hypothesis to include signals for every organelle and location within the cell had an impact far beyond illuminating the targeting of secretory proteins, as it introduced the concept of &#x27;topogenic&#x27; signals for the first time. Before the Signal Hypothesis, it was almost inconceivable that information encoded in the polypeptide chain could determine the localization of proteins in the cell.

== Cell-free Protein Synthesis ==

This relates to cell-free protein synthesis. Cell-free protein synthesis that is without microsomes has no way for incorporation into the microsomes to happen. This means that when microsomal membranes are presented later there isn’t the removal of the signal sequence. With microsomes there, cell-free protein synthesis demonstrates cotranslational transport of the protein into the microsome and therefore the removal of the signal sequence. This process produces a mature protein chain. Studies have looked into the cell-free protein synthesis process when microsomes have their bound ribosomes stripped away from them. This explained certain details about endoplasmic reticulum signal sequences. Normally, a secretory protein only has its signal sequence removed if the microsomes are there for protein synthesis due to the secretory protein being incorporated into the microsomes. Protein transport doesn’t happen if there is a late addition of microsomes after the completion of the protein synthesis process.

Protein extrusion into a microsome can be described by multiple factors. A protein has been extruded if it is resistant to proteases, is not resistant to proteases when detergents are present, or is glycosylated by enzymes residing in the microsomes. Additionally, another sign that a protein has been extruded is signal peptidase cleaving off the N-terminal signal peptide inside the microsome that may cause the protein to be smaller in size.

== Pulse-Chase experiments ==

Microsomes also play a part in the Pulse-Chase experiments. The Pulse-Chase experiments showed that secreted proteins move across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane when the membranes are purified. It was important to take the endoplasmic reticulum away from the rest of the cell to look into translocation but this isn’t possible due to how delicate and interconnected it is. This allowed microsomes to come into play as they have the majority of the biochemical properties of the endoplasmic reticulum. The microsomes are formed through homogenizing the cells and small closed vesicles with ribosomes outside being formed from rough endoplasmic reticulum breakdown. When microsomes were treated with protease, it was found that the polypeptide made by ribosomes ended in the microsomal lumen. This takes place even though the proteins are made on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

Other experiments have shown that microsomes have to be introduced before about the first 70 amino acids are translated for the secretory protein to go into the microsomal lumen. At this point, 40 amino acids are sticking out from the ribosome and the 30 amino acids after that are in the ribosomal channel. Cotranslational translocation explains that transport into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen of secretory proteins starts with the protein still bound to the ribosomes and not completely synthesized.
Microsomes can be concentrated and separated from other cellular debris by differential centrifugation. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and mitochondria sediment out at 10,000 g (where g is the Earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration), whereas soluble enzymes and fragmented ER, which contains cytochrome P450 (CYP), remain in solution. At 100,000 g, achieved by faster centrifuge rotation, ER sediments out of solution as a pellet but the soluble enzymes remain in the supernatant. In this way, cytochrome P450 in microsomes is concentrated and isolated. Microsomes have a reddish-brown color, due to the presence of the heme. Because of the need for a multi-part protein-system, microsomes are necessary to analyze the metabolic activity of CYPs. These CYPs are highly abundant in livers of rats, mice and humans, but present in all other organs and organisms as well.

To get microsomes containing a specific CYP or for high amounts of active enzyme, microsomes are prepared from Sf9 insect cells or in yeast via heterologous expression. Alternatively expression in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; of whole or truncated proteins can also be performed. Therefore, microsomes are a valuable tool for investigating the metabolism of compounds (enzyme inhibition, clearance and metabolite identification) and for examining drug-drug interactions by &quot;in vitro&quot;-research. Researchers often select microsome lots based on the enzyme activity level of specific CYPs. Some lots are available to study specific populations (for example, lung microsomes from smokers or non-smokers) or divided into classifications to meet target CYP activity levels for inhibition and metabolism studies.

Microsomes are used to mimic the activity of the endoplasmic reticulum in a test tube and conduct experiments that require protein synthesis on a membrane. They provide a way for scientists to figure out how proteins are being made on the ER in a cell by reconstituting the process in a test tube.

Keefer et al. looked into how human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes are used to study metabolic stability and inhibition for in vitro systems. Going into their similarities and differences can shine light on the mechanisms of metabolism, passive permeability, and transporters. It was shown that passive permeability is important in metabolism and enzyme inhibition in human hepatocytes. Also, P-gp efflux has a smaller role in this same area. Also, liver microsomes are more predictive than hepatocytes of in vivo clearance when they give higher intrinsic clearance than the hepatocytes.

== MTP ==

Iqbal, Jahangir, and Al-Qarni studied the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). MTP is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein and assists in transferring neutral lipids to nascent apolipoprotein B. MTP has a large use for abetalipoproteinemia patients with MTP mutations because of how it affects the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. These MTP mutations are linked with not having circulation of the apoB-containing lipoproteins. MTP is also involved with cholesterol ester and cluster of differentiation 1d biosynthesis. Transferring sphingolipids to apoB-containing lipoproteins also falls under the ability of MTP. MTP works with the homeostasis of lipids and lipoproteins and is related to certain pathophysiological conditions and metabolic diseases.

Wang et al. explored drug metabolism in vitro using human liver microsomes and human liver S9 fractions. The study found significant differences between human liver microsomes and human liver S9 fractions in drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter protein concentrations.  The protein-protein correlations of these drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters was determined relating to the two hepatic preparations.

<text>Jill Pole is a major character from C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series. She appears in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle.&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;The Silver Chair&quot;===
Jill Pole first appears in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;. She and Eustace attend the same school, and it is from the school grounds that they travel to Aslan&#x27;s Country beyond the Sun, after being chased by bullies. She and Eustace are sent to Narnia by Aslan, to find the kidnapped Prince Rilian, son of Caspian X. They accomplish this with the assistance of the marshwiggle Puddleglum. Jill has to learn to face her claustrophobia and nyctophobia during her quest, and also is the one Aslan has tasked with remembering the four signs that will guide them on their quest. When she is distracted from doing this by temptation of good food and rest as part of the Lady of the Green Kirtle&#x27;s trickery, the group lose their way and find themselves in serious danger from the man-eating giants of Harfang. Jill is also the first to discover the exit from the Underland that leads back to Narnia, and she saves her wonderful clothes from Narnia to wear at fancy dress balls once she is back in England.

===&quot;The Last Battle&quot;===
Jill and Eustace are called into Narnia to help King Tirian in his struggle against the false appearance of Aslan, and a Calormene invasion. They first free the king from where he is tied to a tree. Then the three of them steal away to a Narnian supply garrison where they put on Calormene disguises and return to Stable Hill. When they arrive they free Jewel the Unicorn. Then Jill disobeys the king&#x27;s orders by entering the Stable, but in doing so, she discovers Puzzle the Donkey, the fake Aslan. Jill becomes Puzzle&#x27;s friend and saves him from execution by Tirian.

During the battle, Jill fights with her bow and arrow and kills several Calormene soldiers while weeping for the now-doomed Narnia (she had previously stated that she hoped Narnia would go on forever). She later goes through the stable door and comes into Aslan&#x27;s Country along with the others and also becomes one of the Queens (alongside Polly and Lucy) along with Eustace who becomes a King like Digory, Peter, and Edmund.

==Portrayal==
In the 1990 BBC production of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, Jill Pole was portrayed by Camilla Power.

In the 2010 film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, Jill Pole is mentioned visiting Eustace at the end, although she is not shown.

<doc id="912134" wikidata="Q53545" url="?curid=912134" title="Jan-Michael Gambill">
<text>Jan-Michael Charles Gambill (born June 3, 1977) is an American former professional tennis player who made his professional debut in 1996. His career-high singles ranking is world No. 14, which he achieved on June 18, 2001. Best known for his unusual double-handed forehand, Gambill reached the quarterfinals of the 2000 Wimbledon Championships, the final of the 2001 Miami Masters, and won three singles titles.

==Early life==

Gambill spent the early years of his life in the countryside of Spokane, Washington. He currently resides in both Los Angeles and Kailua-Kona, Hawaii with his partner, architect and developer Malek Alqadi. While Jan-Michael has been sponsored by car manufacturer Jaguar, he also supports real-life Jaguars and tigers through Cat Tales Zoological Park, an organization dedicated to saving the lives of big cats. Gambill has also raised money for his long-time friend Sir Elton John&#x27;s charity, the Elton John AIDS Foundation.
Gambill&#x27;s career as a professional athlete has evolved into coaching tennis players as well as being an international analyst for BeIn sports. Gambill was also sponsored by Prince for both his racquets and apparel.

==Tennis career==
===1996–2005===
Gambill began playing tennis at the age of five, looking up to multiple Grand Slam singles titlists Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe. He has defeated, amongst other top players, former World No. 1s, Roger Federer, Carlos Moyá, Lleyton Hewitt, Gustavo Kuerten, Marcelo Ríos, Jim Courier, Pete Sampras, and Andre Agassi, as well as Grand Slam champions Michael Chang, Thomas Johansson, Sergi Bruguera, and Gastón Gaudio. His best performances at Grand Slams have been reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 2000 and the fourth round of the US Open in 2002. His run at Wimbledon in 2000 saw him beat Lleyton Hewitt, Fabrice Santoro, Paul Goldstein and Thomas Enqvist before losing to eventual champion Pete Sampras. His run to the final of the 2001 Miami Masters included wins over Hewitt, Gaudio, and Thomas Enqvist. He was coached by his father Chuck Gambill (1947–2020), who coached Jan-Michael&#x27;s younger brother Torrey, who was also a professional tennis player.

Throughout his career, Gambill was hampered by numerous injuries. Most prominently, while still in the world&#x27;s top 40, he suffered a recurring shin condition, which severely limited him on the ATP Tour after 2004. He also started serving harder to try and compensate for lack of movement, which resulted in a shoulder injury.

===Post–2005===
Gambill played for the Boston Lobsters in the World Team Tennis league from 2008 onwards, alongside other successful American players such as Andre Agassi, John Isner, and Robby Ginepri.

In September 2009, Gambill reached the semifinals of the USA F23 Futures tournament (losing to second seed Michael McClune) in his first pro match of the year.

He competed in three Challenger events in 2010, and reached the quarterfinals of the USA F25 Futures in Irvine, California. Since October 2010, Gambill has not competed on the pro tour.

Since July 2011, he has coached top 10 player CoCo Vandeweghe, his former Boston Lobsters teammate, on the WTA Tour. In 2017, he coached top 50 player Jared Donaldson on the ATP Tour. As of 2020, he is currently in broadcasting and television as a Sports Analyst on the Tennis Channel.

==Personal life==
Gambill is gay and in a relationship with architectural designer and developer Malek Alqadi.

==ATP Tour finals==
=== Singles (3 titles, 4 runner-ups)===

<doc id="912138" wikidata="Q2296250" url="?curid=912138" title="Osburh">
<text>Osburh or Osburga (also Osburga Oslacsdotter) was the first wife of King Æthelwulf of Wessex and mother of King Alfred the Great. Alfred&#x27;s biographer, Asser, described her as &quot;a most religious woman, noble in character and noble by birth&quot;.

==Sources==
Osburh&#x27;s existence is known only from Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;. She is not named as witness to any charters, nor is her death reported in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. So far as is known, she was the mother of all Æthelwulf&#x27;s children, his five sons Æthelstan, Æthelbald, Æthelberht, Æthelred and Alfred, and his daughter Æthelswith, wife of King Burgred of Mercia.

Osburh is best known from Asser&#x27;s story about a book of Saxon songs which she showed to her sons, offering to give the book to whoever could first memorise it, a challenge which Alfred took up and won. This exhibits high-status ninth-century women&#x27;s interest in books and their role in educating their children.

Osburh was the daughter of Oslac (who is also only known from Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;), King Æthelwulf&#x27;s &quot;pincerna&quot; (cupbearer), an important figure in the royal court and household. Oslac is described as being of partial Gothic ancestry, and descendant of King Cerdic&#x27;s Jutish nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar, who conquered and settled the Isle of Wight.

<doc id="912142" wikidata="Q1771203" url="?curid=912142" title="Project accounting">
<text>Project accounting is a type of managerial accounting oriented toward the goals of project management and delivery. It involves tracking, reporting, and analyzing financial results and implications, and sometimes the creation of financial reports designed to track the financial progress of projects; the information generated by this analysis is used to aid project management.

Project accounting is traditionally used for large construction, engineering, and government projects. It is commonly used by government contractors, where the ability to account for costs by contract, and sometimes by individual contract line item [CLIN], is often a requirement for interim payments. A specialized form of project accounting, production accounting, is used by production studios to track an individual movie or television episode&#x27;s costs.

The capital budget processes of large corporations and governmental entities are chiefly concerned with major investment projects, which typically have significant upfront costs and benefits realized over the long term. Investment &quot;go/no-go&quot; decisions are largely based on net present value assessments; project accounting and cost/benefit analyses provide vital feedback on the quality of those decisions.

== Practice ==

Projects (which may be independent undertakings or occur as part of a larger program) differ from a company&#x27;s routine activities in a number of ways: they frequently involve efforts across departmental boundaries, and their budgets may be revised many times over the course of their execution (which can range from days to years). Accordingly, in a project accounting paradigm, certain projects are considered separate entities in the course of working on products which require separate financial management, a task for which existing management accounting and financial accounting techniques are often insufficient.

Project accounting (which involves elements of management accounting and financial accounting) is differentiated by a number of unique practices:
* A separate accounting system or cost center is used to track and report project-specific transactions with revenues, costs, assets, and liabilities identified and allocated to the project. Costs (both direct and overhead) and revenues are allocated to projects, which may be subdivided into a work breakdown structure, and grouped into the project hierarchies.
* Reporting is done frequently, with the pace often increasing as a project approaches completion.
* Detailed reports are often accompanied by a separate layer of simplified reports, which examine key performance indicators (KPIs) to indicate whether a project is &quot;on track&quot;. Reports can be made at any level that has been defined, and are often compared with historical and current budgets.
* Transactions are allocated to the specific project accounting systems based on a process for identifying them among transactions in the primary accounting system.

The role of a project accountant depends on a project&#x27;s needs. They often monitor the financial progress of projects, investigate variance, and approve expenses, while ensuring that project billings are issued to customers and payments are collected. Project accountants play a dual role of gatekeeper (reporting a view of how the project is tracking financially) and advisor (advising the project team on the financial treatment and implications of decisions). The project accountant can also act as a liaison between the project itself and the business&#x27;s financial or accounting departments.

Where labor costs are a significant portion of the overall project cost, it is usually necessary for employees to fill out timesheets in order to generate the data to allocate project costs.

== Percentage of completion ==

Percentage-of-completion is frequently independently assessed by a project manager, program management officer (PMO), or project accountant. This measurement includes the continuous recognition of revenue related to longer-term projects; by doing this, the seller is able to identify gains or losses relevant to a project in every active accounting period. Funding advances, and budget-to-actual-cost variances, are calculated using the project budget adjusted to percent-of-completion.

While the percentage-of-completion method permits companies to track profits while progress is made toward completing projects, this method cannot be used effectively when uncertainties exist about the percentage of completion or remaining costs. The percentage-of-completion may be measured in any of the resulting ways:

=== Cost-to-cost method ===
In the cost-to-cost method, a project&#x27;s cost to date is compared to the total expected cost of the project. The costs of products already bought for a contract, but not installed, should not be added in calculating the percentage of completion (unless they were specifically obtained for that contract). Furthermore, the cost of equipment is assigned over the course of the contract, rather than directly, unless title to the supplies is being transported to the customer.

=== Efforts-expended method ===
In the efforts-expended method, the share of effort consumed to date is compared to the total effort expected for the project. For example, the completion percentage may be established on direct work hours, machine hours, or quantities of material.

=== Units-of-delivery-method ===
In the units-of-delivery method, the portion of units delivered to the buyer is compared to the overall number of units to be delivered under the terms of a contract. This method, obviously, can only be used on projects consisting of the delivery of multiple units. The calculations involve revenue (the contract price of units delivered) and expenses (the costs that can be reasonably allocated to the units delivered).

== Production accounting ==
Production accounting is used to manage finances and financial records in the film industry and television production. Production accountants work in close association with the producer and the production office.

<text>Leonard Helm was an American frontiersman and military officer who served during the American Revolutionary War. Born around 1720 probably in Fauquier County, Virginia, he died in poverty while fighting Native American allies of British troops during one of the last engagements of the Revolutionary War around June 4, 1782, in Jefferson County, Virginia (now Jefferson County, Kentucky).

==Early life==
Leonard Helm was born around 1720 in Virginia to Leonard Helm Sr. and his wife Margaret Neil Helm. His father emigrated from England and the family traces their ancestry to Lancaster, England.

==Illinois Campaign==
Helm was commissioned a captain and asked to raise and lead a company of Virginians by the newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel George Rogers Clark. On January 2, 1778, Governor Patrick Henry, of Virginia, gave George Rogers Clark the authority to raise a regiment and secret orders to attack British forces and their allies on Virginia&#x27;s frontier. Leonard Helm, who had served with Clark during Dunmore&#x27;s War and had spent a lot of time in Kentucky, was given command of one of the initial four companies created to form this regiment. Captain Helm recruited soldiers from the Virginia militia from both Prince William and Fauquier Counties. Clark nicther unit was later known as the Illinois Regiment and participated in the Northwest Campaign.

Clark and his men captured Kaskaskia, Illinois, on July 4, 1778, and Cahokia, Illinois July 6, 1778. During the capture of Kaskaskia, Clark split his force, commanding one half himself with Captain Helm commanding the other. A series of relatively peaceful conquests took place, with Helm reaching as far as Fort Ouiatenon.

==Vincennes==
Vincennes decided to support the Americans at the urging of Father Gibault, and Captain Helm was sent to command Fort Sackville(renamed Fort Patrick Henry), with a group of local French speaking militiamen and 20 soldiers from Virginia. He requested and received support from the local Piankeshaw tribe, especially the chief known as Young Tobacco.

The British retook the fort on 17 December 1778, after Helm&#x27;s local militia had deserted and he had too few men to attempt resistance. When the British formed within yards of the fort, Captain Helm opened the gate and pointed a cannon at the British formation, with an artillery match in one hand and a bottle of whiskey with the other.

He invited Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton to share whiskey and discuss terms as gentlemen. Knowing that the British did not fully understand his tactical situation, he demanded and received favorable terms of surrender. Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton was later shocked to find only three people within the fort but honored his agreement. When Colonel Clark heard about the surrender several weeks later, he and his force made a bold march through icy winter weather and laid siege to Fort Sackville. Captain Helm was inside Fort Sackville as a prisoner during the siege, and Clark notes in his memoir that he &quot;amused himself very much during the siege, and, I believe, did much damage.&quot;

Helm came with the British party to the 24 February negotiations to end the siege, and tried to negotiate Clark&#x27;s harsh terms of surrender. Clark countered that Helm could not negotiate because he was a British prisoner, at which point Hamilton released Helm. Whether he meant to reinforce his hardline negotiations or reprimand Helm for his impropriety in seemingly negotiating for Hamilton, Clark refused to receive the captain, and informed Helm that he must return to Fort Sackville and &quot;await his fate.&quot; Hamilton surrendered 25 February 1779, and Fort Sackville was again renamed Fort Patrick Henry.

==Wabash Expedition==
On 5 March 1779, Helm led a small force of 3 boats and 50 men up the Wabash River from Vincennes and captured a fleet of 7 boats, 40 prisoners (among whom, Clark noted in a letter to George Mason, was &#x27;Dejeane, Grand Judge of Detroit&#x27;), supplies, and trade goods that were sent to reinforce Hamilton at Fort Sackville. The battle occurred just west of Pointe Coupee, Indiana, and is locally referred to as the westernmost naval battle of the American Revolution, despite the account of the capture in George Rogers Clark&#x27;s memoir:
March 5th, Captain Helm, Majors Bosseron and Legras, returned from their journey up the river with great success. They came up with the enemy in the night, discerning their fires at a distance; waited until all was quiet; surrounded and took the whole prisoners, without the firing of a gun. Those (British) gentlemen were off their guard, and so little apprehensive of an enemy in that part of the world that they could hardly persuade themselves that what they saw and heard was real. This was a valuable (prize) seven boats loaded with provisions and goods to a considerable amount.

==Battle of the White River Forks==
When Clark left Vincennes for Kaskaskia on 20 March 1779, he again appointed Captain Helm as commandant of the town, as well as Superintendent of Indian Affairs. While in command, a party of five traders left Vincennes for the Falls of the Ohio, along the ancient Buffalo Trace. A small band of Delaware from a village called &quot;Lechauwitank&quot;, between the forks of the White River, ambushed the traders, killed them, and plundered their goods. Helm&#x27;s reaction from Vincennes was strong. Helm called up the Vincennes militia and the garrison under Lt. Brashears, and they attacked the village at night. The entire village was destroyed, the surviving men were tomahawked to death in Vincennes, and the women and children were sold into slavery.

==Fort Nelson and death==
Clark later appointed Helm as commander of the fort in present-day Louisville, Kentucky. Captain Helm was killed while serving as the commander of this fort. Helm had sold some of his land for continental currency under the belief that the value of it would increase. Instead, the continental dollar became almost worthless and Helm died in poverty, his personal estate consisting only of his clothes. Many years later his heirs received 4,666 acres (19 km2) from Virginia for his service in the Illinois Regiment. Leonard Helm&#x27;s service during the American Revolution meets the requirements for membership in the Society of the Cincinnati.

<text>John Hessin Clarke (September 18, 1857 – March 22, 1945) was an American lawyer and judge who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1916 to 1922.

==Early life==
Born in New Lisbon, Ohio, Clarke was the third and youngest child and only son of John Clarke (1814–1884), a Quaker immigrant from County Antrim, Ireland who became a lawyer and judge in the United States, and his wife Melissa Hessin. He attended New Lisbon High School and Western Reserve College, where he became a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1877. Clarke did not attend law school but studied the law under his father&#x27;s direction and passed the bar exam &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1878.

After practicing law in New Lisbon for two years, Clarke moved to Youngstown, where he purchased a half-share in the &quot;Youngstown Vindicator&quot;. The &quot;Vindicator&quot; was a Democratic newspaper and Clarke, a reform-minded Bourbon Democrat, wrote several articles opposing the growing power of corporate monopolies and promoting such causes as civil-service reform. He also became involved in local party politics and civic causes. His efforts to prevent Calvin S. Brice&#x27;s renomination as the party&#x27;s candidate for the United States Senate in 1894 ended in failure, but he worked successfully to oppose the election of a Republican candidate for mayor of Youngstown who was a member of the American Protective Association. A &quot;gold bug&quot; in 1896, Clarke&#x27;s opposition to William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s nomination as the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential candidate was so great that he bolted the party and participated in the subsequent &quot;Gold Bug&quot; convention in Indianapolis that nominated Senator John M. Palmer later that year.

==Progressive politician==
Soon after the 1896 presidential election, Clarke moved to Cleveland, where he became a partner in the law firm of Williamson and Cushing. The firm represented corporate and railroad interests, and Clarke soon demonstrated his worth, replacing senior partner Samuel W. Williamson as the general counsel for the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. Yet Clarke continued his involvement in the Democratic Party. His politics evolved during this period, as Clarke abandoned many of the political views of his youth, including those involving states&#x27; rights, and embraced instead the program of the emerging progressive movement. Clarke&#x27;s political evolution during this period was facilitated considerably by his friendship with Cleveland mayor Tom L. Johnson, who helped restore Clarke&#x27;s standing within the state party after Clarke&#x27;s previous failure to support Bryan&#x27;s presidential bid.

In 1903, Johnson succeeded in taking control of the state Democratic Party, an effort which Clarke supported. At the party&#x27;s convention that August, Clarke was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Though an accomplished orator, Clarke&#x27;s work as a railroad attorney, his opposition to Bryan&#x27;s presidential candidacy seven years before, and his own personal limitations all contributed to his failure to upset his Republican rival, Mark Hanna, who won the balloting in the Ohio General Assembly by 115 votes to 25 for Clarke.

In the aftermath of his defeat, Clarke reduced his participation in party politics, focusing instead on his legal work for a time. Yet Clarke was soon back in the political arena, withdrawing from the partnership with Williamson and Cushing in 1907. His relationship with Johnson suffered after Clarke supported the successful candidacy of conservative Democrat Judson Harmon for governor in 1908; in response, when nominating a candidate for the United States Senate race in 1910 Johnson passed over Clarke in favor of Atlee Pomerene, the eventual winner. Clarke&#x27;s support for the incorporation of progressive reforms into the Ohio Constitution in 1911, however, helped to restore his standing among Ohio progressives. Clarke attempted to parlay this into a second run for a United States Senate seat early in 1914, but he faced opposition in the primary from Ohio Attorney General Timothy S. Hogan and by the spring appeared to be in danger of losing the race.

==Judicial career==

===Federal judge===
Clarke was in the middle of his primary campaign when he was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson on July 15, 1914 to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio created by the resignation of William Louis Day. Clarke was the choice of both Woodrow Wilson and Attorney General James Clark McReynolds, who felt that the position required a &quot;first rate appointment&quot; to deal with the backlog in the court&#x27;s docket, and that Clarke&#x27;s high standing before the Ohio bar marked him out as a man of &quot;decided ability&quot;. Wilson also wanted a candidate who could be groomed as a prospective Supreme Court nominee, given the relative dearth of Democratic prospects on the federal bench after sixteen years of Republican presidents. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 21, 1914, and received commission the same day.

Clarke soon vindicated their hopes in him, establishing himself as an effective judge. Though considered too formal and aloof by the attorneys before him, he cleaned up the backlogged docket and won their respect for his ability. His work was of the highest quality, with only five of the 662 suits tried before him reversed, and none of these for errors in the admission of evidence. Clarke himself enjoyed his time at the district level, finding his duties not too onerous and the variety of cases before him stimulating.

===Associate Justice===

In June 1916, a vacancy arose on the Supreme Court when Associate Justice Charles Evans Hughes resigned to accept the Republican nomination for President. Wilson wanted to fill the seat by appointing his Attorney General, Thomas W. Gregory, but Gregory demurred and suggested Clarke instead. After having Newton Baker (Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of War and a close friend of Clarke&#x27;s) speak with Clarke to confirm his opposition to trusts, Wilson offered Clarke the nomination. Though Clarke was reluctant to abandon trial for appellate work, he felt he could not pass on such an honor and accepted. Wilson sent his name to the Senate on July 14, 1916, and Clarke was confirmed by the United States Senate unanimously ten days later. He was sworn into office on October 9, 1916. 

Clarke&#x27;s years on the court were unhappy ones. Having enjoyed the autonomy of a trial court judge, he chafed at the routine of the Supreme Court, hating the arguments, the extended conferences, and the need to accommodate other justices&#x27; views when writing opinions. The record of his opinions during his five years on the bench reflected this dissatisfaction. While he issued 129 majority opinions, he also dissented 57 times in his short term on the court. While he enjoyed good relations with the other justices (and developed close friendships with William R. Day and Willis Van Devanter), he had an unpleasant relationship with Justice James Clark McReynolds, one that subsequently contributed to his decision to leave the Court. Such was McReynolds&#x27;s animosity towards Clarke that, when Clarke resigned, McReynolds refused to sign the official letter of regret over his departure.

Philosophically, Clarke demonstrated an affinity for legal realism in his opinions. He often voted with Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Louis Brandeis, usually in dissent from the conservative majority dominant on the Court at that time, though Holmes&#x27;s famous dissent from the &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; decision was in response to Clarke&#x27;s majority opinion. As a Progressive, he supported the power of both national and state authorities to regulate the economy, particularly with regard to regulating child labor. His dissents on two cases, &quot;Hammer v. Dagenhart&quot; and &quot;Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Company&quot;, supported Congress&#x27;s authority under the Commerce Clause (in the &quot;Hammer&quot; case) and the Taxing and Spending Clause (in the &quot;Bailey&quot; case) to address what Progressives saw as a major social problem. He also demonstrated his opposition to monopoly in &quot;United States v. Reading Company&quot;, in a ruling that became a prominent part of anti-trust law.

====Resignation====
Clarke&#x27;s impact on the Court&#x27;s jurisprudence was limited by his relatively brief service on it. On September 1, 1922, Clarke sent a letter to President Warren G. Harding announcing his intention to resign from the Court. His decision was motivated by a number of factors. Apart from his dissatisfaction with his work as a justice and his ongoing difficulties with McReynolds, Clarke had recently suffered the loss of his sisters Ida and Alice. Moreover, having witnessed the physical decline of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, he wished to avoid a similar deterioration while on the bench. Clarke would have few regrets about his decision, and informed his successor, George Sutherland, that the latter was embarking on &quot;a dog&#x27;s life.&quot;

==Later years==

===Campaigning to join the League of Nations===
In an interview three days after submitting his resignation, Clarke outlined a new cause he wanted to pursue – convincing Americans that the United States should join the League of Nations. At the time, prospects for League entry were at a low ebb, its proponents having suffered the dual setback of the Senate&#x27;s rejection of the Versailles Treaty and the election of the anti-League Republican Warren G. Harding as president in 1920. Clarke&#x27;s public pronouncements gave their cause a new life, and in October 1922 he became the president of a new organization, the League of Nations Non-Partisan Association. Modeled after the British League of Nations Union, the Association&#x27;s mission was to awaken the underlying support for joining the League that its founders believed existed within the United States and mobilize it to overcome the opposition to League participation. Through it, Clarke quickly emerged as Wilson&#x27;s successor in the campaign for League membership.

Though Clarke committed himself to the cause with a series of speaking tours, he soon faced a number of challenges. Expenditures quickly outpaced the Association&#x27;s funding, with limited resources squandered on building up an extensive organization. Though Clarke organized a restructuring in June 1923, a far greater problem lay in his underestimation of the task he faced. Contrary to Clarke&#x27;s expectations, there was no latent undercurrent of support for joining the League, only skepticism and hostility to the idea. Addressing this required a far different level of commitment than Clarke expected to make, forcing him and the rest of the Association leadership to scale back on their goals. Focusing on the issue of entry into the World Court, Clarke continued to campaign for American involvement in international organizations and agreements for the remainder of the decade.

===Retirement===
By the end of 1927, Clarke&#x27;s growing deafness and frustration with the failures of the Association led him to resign from the Association&#x27;s presidency. In retirement Clarke remained vigorous and active with a regimen of reading and travel. He also continued to participate in public service, becoming a trustee of Western Reserve University. In 1932, he backed a clandestine effort to nominate Newton Baker as the Democratic presidential candidate, though after its failure Clarke became a supporter of the New Deal and President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Despite misgivings about the methods, he sympathized with the goals underlying the president&#x27;s Supreme Court &quot;packing&quot; plan, and at Roosevelt&#x27;s request Clarke made a radio broadcast in March 1937 in which he defended the constitutionality of the proposal.

In 1931 Clarke moved from Cleveland to San Diego, where he lived in the El Cortez Apartment Hotel. It was there that he suffered a heart attack and died on March 22, 1945. He was later honored by his alma mater by having a residence hall, Clarke Tower, named after him on the Case Western Reserve campus.

<text>Chilkoot Pass (el. ) is a high mountain pass through the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains in the U.S. state of Alaska and British Columbia, Canada. It is the highest point along the Chilkoot Trail that leads from Dyea, Alaska to Bennett Lake, British Columbia. The Chilkoot Trail was long a route used by the Tlingit for trade.

During the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 19th century, it was used by prospectors and packers to get through the mountains. During the gold rush, three aerial tramways and several surface hoists were constructed and operated briefly over the pass. When the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad was built in neighboring White Pass, the Chilkoot Pass route fell out of favor with miners.

The Pass and the Trail are administered by the national park services of the U.S. and Canada. On the B.C. side, it is administered as Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site. On the Alaska side, it is one unit of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. In the summer of 1998, the Site and the Park united to form Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. Modern-day visitors can hike the trail after registering and paying a fee.

==Background==
The Klondike Gold rush had begun on August 16, 1896, on Bonanza Creek. This was located near Dawson, and east of the Alaskan border.
The Chilkoot Trail is reported to have spanned between from sea level at Dyea, Alaska to Lake Bennett, British Columbia, elevation 2602 ft. (642 m.).
The Chilkoot Pass was an important milestone which travellers had to conquer in order to reach the Klondike. The travellers were called &#x27;stampeders,&#x27; and some had earlier sought the riches of the 1889 gold rush in Alaska.

To be allowed to enter the Klondike and take part in the gold rush, Canadian officials required that stampeders take one ton of goods with them, to try to ensure they were prepared to survive on the frontier. This was broken down into a year&#x27;s supply of food, which was half of the weight, as well as another of equipment. The supplies and food requirements were broken down into two lists. The clothing items included: a waterproof blanket, 6 pairs of wool socks, 2 flannel over shirts, and a medicine chest. The list continues with the essential clothing needed. Some of the supplies required included: rolled oats, flour, salt, and bacon. The weight ranged from for one ingredient. This list was taken very seriously, as there was rarely a return journey after the Klondike was reached.
Park officials still require travellers to make preparation for hiking in this area. But in 1995, the list for travelling the Trail and Pass was very different, as the technologies allowed for a much smaller supply list. In addition, more creature comforts were available, such as a lightweight camp stove.

No traveller could take his supplies across the pass at once, so several trips had to be made in order to transport all needed goods to the destination. Quite often the supplies had to be carried by hand in 50-60 pound packs, as the passes proved to be too narrow for wagons or draft animals. The travel was slow and what would have taken a few hours in another environment required days to complete. It is estimated that for every mile their supplies moved, the travelers had to walk 80 miles to get it there.

Only the wealthiest of stampeders could afford to hire labour to transport their supplies. Most stampeders had to carry their own. The professional packers of the time mainly consisted of Alaska Natives and First Nations people (Indians), who charged 1 cent per pound they carried. Working the market, the packers quickly moved to new customers if there was a hint of more money to be offered by someone else. The packing fees charged by professional packers were subject to change as the weather changed. Ground conditions could make the packing much more difficult, and muddier ground conditions were harder to traverse as compared to frozen, snow-covered ground.

==The Pass==

The Chilkoot trail rose to the base of the Chilkoot Pass to an area called the Scales. This was a rough rock-strewn area and was named because it was the last place where travelers could have their packs reweighed, and adjustments could be made to their payments. The Scales was also used as a place where travelers could store their provisions and supplies while going to lower levels to get the remainder, before continuing on their journey up the Pass. After the Scales, the ground rose about over a distance of approximately . The trail was covered with giant, sharp slabs of rock, which made the footing treacherous and often induced crawling during the summer months.

In the winter, workers cut the ice into 1500 steps, which came to be known as the &#x27;Golden Stairs&#x27;. The steps were too narrow for more than one person to climb up at a time, so the trek was limited to a single-file line up the mountain, as shown in the photo for this article. The workers who had carved steps into the ice of Chilkoot Pass also charged travelers to ascend the mountain, as the travelers had to use their stairs.

===Tramways===

Ropes were lowered along the trail to help the travelers balance and continue up the slippery slopes. After 1897 a tramway was built so that wealthy travelers could ease their last up the Pass. The tramway was powered by two horses, and it cost to hire. Historians have estimated the builder of the tramway was making $150 per day by his development. On the other side of the Pass was Emerald Lake. To travel down the mountain, the travelers faced a descent of over the horizontal distance of approximately . The crest through the mountain and the path down it were often filled with snow all year round, making the trek more difficult.

===Environment===
There was a high risk of avalanche along the Chilkoot Pass, as snow storms were frequent and the snow could give way and speed down the summit. The wet and heavy snow of the avalanches could kill 50 to 100 men at a time. Travelers persisted in using the high-risk pass the most because it was the least expensive route, as well as the shortest route, for transporting their supplies.

The weather through the Pass was unpredictable and visibility could drop to a few feet. Travelers became soaked from rain and sweat from their physical exertion; the sun&#x27;s reflection against the snow could burn their skin and almost blind them. The price of provisions took a discernible downturn, as many men who had packed their year&#x27;s worth of provisions to White Pass (an alternative route), had decided to turn back and sold their provisions to anyone who chose to ascend the Passes. The price of horses had increased to approximately $200 an animal at the trip&#x27;s beginning.

==North-West Mounted Police==

At both the Chilkoot Pass and the White Pass, members of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) were assigned to collect custom duties on the supplies brought into Canada. These officers were also used to protect supplies. As noted above, when stampeders traveled by the Chilkoot Pass, they had to leave some of their provisions at each end of the pass during the journey, as they could not manage transporting them all at once. To protect the supplies, a large detachment of the North-West Mounted Police was stationed there to ensure the proper wares went to the proper traveler. The police also ensured that the rule of 1 ton of goods per person was enforced.

Tensions arose between the NWMP and the Americans related to disputes about where the international borders were located. After several disputes between the governments, they decided to keep the international boundary at the Chilkoot and the White Passes. The NWMP had already built custom houses at both passes prior to the dispute being settled. Canada also used its militia, called the Yukon Field Force, to help the NWMP with guarding prisoners and protecting gold shipments. The NWMP also regulated the whisky trade along the trails.

The police had wanted to build a port of entry at the summits of both the Chilkoot Pass and the White Pass. This was to secure the border between Canada and the United States at these points. The endeavor would cost a small fortune, as the wood had to be taken up the tramway, and they had to bribe any offended packers. They wanted to avoid any delay in getting a cabin on the Chilkoot Pass summit. But, the cabin was not constructed well and the high winds of the Chilkoot Pass drove snow into it. As the snow melted, the interior became wet, creating mould; living conditions were so poor that blankets and bedding would not dry. The collection of custom duties on the summit of Chilkoot Pass began on February 26, 1898. The role was transferred to customs officers when an office opened that June but closed in September 1900 on the building of the White Pass and Yukon Route.

==Women on the Trails==
With rumors of some successes, both men and women viewed the Gold Rush as a chance to make a fortune and break out of poverty. Based on steam ship passenger lists, historians estimate that approximately 1500 women made the trek through the Chilkoot and White trails. This represented seven percent of all the travelers between December 1898 and September 1900. At the beginning of the gold rush stampede, only a few hundred non-native women participated. Some of these women were wives of the stampeders, while others had traveled in order to gain employment as clerks, teachers, cooks, nurses, and prostitutes. Camp Lindeman was reported to have a woman doctor.

Women&#x27;s clothing of the time made their journeys through the trails and across the passes even more difficult. The long, full skirts were ill-suited for any physical labour, and were often made with five yards (or more) of material, making them very heavy and cumbersome. Having to wear corsets and petticoats further limited women&#x27;s mobility. The high collars required women to hold their heads high and, depending on the outfit, tilt their heads back. During this period, a women&#x27;s movement had formed to allow women more freedom in the way they dressed. The rigors of the trail meant that many women abandoned conventional clothing and began to wear bloomers or knickers. These long, full pants were gathered at the ankle or just below the knees. Women shortened their skirts over the bloomers, generally to knee length. This was considered controversial by many men, but was more acceptable than if the women had not worn skirts. Some of the women who traveled to the Klondike had left their children behind, as few were willing to subject their children to the dangers of the trails and passes.

==Alternate route==
The trail from Skagway, Alaska to White Pass and Lake Lindeman was an alternative, but the trail was subject to outlaws. Soapy Smith and his gang centered in the port makeshift town of Skagway below the Pass were conniving and murderous thieves—if they couldn&#x27;t cheat someone out of their belongings or money, they would steal valuables, and killing those that got in their way was common. The White Pass became more narrow and difficult to travel than as first presented to stampeders. Dynamite from a site above the trail caused a massive block to fall on the Dunns [their first names may have been Elizabeth and Michael], a married pair traveling with their horses. The block buried them and their horses and remains there to this day on the trail, adorned with a black Christian cross, now known as Black Cross Rock. This pass became too narrow for wagons, but men still tried to use horses along the trail. Many had little or no experience working with animals and drove the horses to death. The men would either shoot the horses or, if the horse fell and could not get up, they would just pull its horseshoes and go off, leaving the animal to die in the mud and snow. This was a common occurrence on White Pass along a stretch that was dubbed Dead Horse Trail. The men traveled back down to the beach again and purchased more horses to replace the ones that died on this trail.

Most of the horses that died on the White Pass trail gave out or were killed within a stretch of slope. By 1897, 3200 pack horses had died on White Pass trail, and their bodies were left there. The bodies of the horses were often used as footing for other pack horses making their way through the trail. The horses that had fallen were not always dead, and suffered more under the hooves of others.

When the horses could not work anymore, or were of no further use along the Chilkoot Trail, the animals were turned loose without feed. Many animals were left at the base of Chilkoot Pass at Sheep Camp. Most of the animals became sick and starved as they staggered through the camps trying to find food. The horses were no longer useful and had lost their value.

Malnutrition was a large problem for the travelers on the Chilkoot and White Pass Trails, and many died from it. Sometimes people suffering from malnutrition ate the bodies of the dead horses left on the White Pass Trail, and became violently ill as a result. It was rumoured that a traveler had used his boots as a source of food by boiling them and drinking the broth after so he could eat something. Physical illness was not the only problem to plague the travelers, as many also went insane from the conditions along the trails. Historians have suggested that the high rate of mental problems recounted were caused by the poor diets of many travelers, added to what may have been poor condition before starting the trails. In addition, along the trail the only shelter against the sometimes -40 degree temperatures were thin tents.
==In culture==
The pass is depicted in the 1925 Charlie Chaplin movie The Gold Rush, the 1929 silent The Trail of &#x27;98, and the 1991 film White Fang.

The name of the pass also replaces “Yosemite” for Yosemite Sam’s character in the 1952 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animated cartoon 14 Carrot Rabbit.
