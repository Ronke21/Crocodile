<text>A chronology of Jesus aims to establish a timeline for the events of the life of Jesus. Scholars have correlated Jewish and Greco-Roman documents and astronomical calendars with the New Testament accounts to estimate dates for the major events in Jesus&#x27;s life.

Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the birth of Jesus: one based on the accounts in the Gospels of his birth with reference to King Herod&#x27;s reign, and the other by subtracting his stated age of &quot;about 30 years&quot; when he began preaching. Most scholars, on this basis, assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC.

Three details have been used to estimate the year when Jesus began preaching: a mention of his age of &quot;about 30 years&quot; during &quot;the fifteenth year&quot; of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, another relating to the date of the building of the Temple in Jerusalem, and yet another concerning the death of John the Baptist. Hence, scholars estimate that Jesus began preaching and gathering followers around AD 28–29. According to the three synoptic gospels Jesus continued preaching for at least one year, and according to John the Evangelist for three years.

Five methods have been used to estimate the date of the crucifixion of Jesus. One uses non-Christian sources such as Josephus and Tacitus. Another works backwards from the historically well-established trial of the Apostle Paul by the Roman proconsul Gallio in Corinth in AD 51/52 to estimate the date of Paul&#x27;s conversion. Both methods result in AD 36 as an upper bound to the crucifixion. Thus, scholars generally agree that Jesus was crucified between AD 30 and AD 36. Isaac Newton&#x27;s astronomical method calculates those ancient Passovers (always defined by a full moon) which are preceded by a Friday, as specified by all four Gospels; this leaves two potential crucifixion dates, 7 April AD 30 and 3 April AD 33. In the lunar eclipse method, the Apostle Peter&#x27;s statement that the moon turned to blood at the crucifixion () is taken to refer to the lunar eclipse of 3 April AD 33; although astronomers are discussing whether the eclipse was visible as far west as Jerusalem. Recent astronomical research uses the supposed contrast between the synoptic date of Jesus&#x27; last Passover on the one hand with John&#x27;s date of the subsequent &quot;Jewish Passover&quot; on the other hand, to propose Jesus&#x27; Last Supper to have been on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33 and the crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD 33.

==Context and overview==
The Christian gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. They were written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity rather than historical chronicles, and their authors showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. One indication that the gospels are theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one-third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, also known as the Passion of Christ.

Nevertheless, the gospels provide some details regarding events which can be clearly dated, so one can establish date ranges regarding major events in Jesus&#x27; life by comparison with independent sources. A number of historical non-Christian documents, such as Jewish and Greco-Roman sources, have been used in historical analyses of the chronology of Jesus. Virtually all modern historians agree that Jesus existed, and regard his baptism and his crucifixion as historical events, and assume that approximate ranges for these events can be estimated.

Using these methods, most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC, and that Jesus&#x27; preaching began around AD 27–29 and lasted one to three years. They calculate the death of Jesus as having taken place between AD 30 and 36.

== Year of Jesus&#x27; birth ==

The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC. Two main methods have been used to estimate the year of the birth of Jesus: one based on the accounts of his birth in the gospels with reference to King Herod&#x27;s reign, and another based on subtracting his stated age of &quot;about 30 years&quot; from the time when he began preaching () in &quot;the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar&quot; (Luke 3:1-2): the two methods indicate a date of birth before Herod&#x27;s death in 4 BC, and a date of birth around 2 BC, respectively.

===Biblical references to King Herod&#x27;s reign===
The two nativity accounts of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke differ substantially from each other, and are considered to have been written independently. However, some consistent elements are evidently derived from a common early tradition:
*Jesus was born under the Judean king Herod the Great (Matthew 2:1f; Luke 1:5 vs Luke 2:1f)
*in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:5f; Luke 2:4.15)
*prior to his parents moving to Nazareth (Matthew 2:22f), or before their return to Nazareth (Luke 2,39).
*Jesus&#x27; parents Mary and Joseph were betrothed (Matthew 1:18–20; Luke 1:27; 2:5).
* His birth was a virgin birth conceived by the Holy Spirit.
* Angels announced Jesus&#x27; birth, his name, his role as the Messiah (being a descendant of King David and the son of God), and his mission to save his people from sin (Matthew 1:21; Luke 1:77; 2:11,30).

Thus both Luke and Matthew independently associate Jesus&#x27; birth with the reign of Herod the Great. Matthew furthermore implies that Jesus was up to two years old when Herod reportedly ordered the Massacre of the Innocents, that is, the murder of all boys in Bethlehem up to the age of two (Matthew 2:16).

Most scholarship concerning the date of Herod&#x27;s death follows Emil Schürer&#x27;s calculations published in 1896, which revised a traditional death date of 1 BC to 4 BC. Two of Herod&#x27;s sons, Archelaus and Philip the Tetrarch, dated their rule from 4 BC, though Archelaus apparently held royal authority during Herod&#x27;s lifetime. Philip&#x27;s reign would last for 37 years, until his death in the traditionally accepted 20th year of Tiberius (AD 34), which implies his accession as 4 BC. The oldest manuscripts of Josephus’s &quot;Antiquities&quot; has the death of Philip in the 22nd year not the 20th, of Tiberius. In the British Library there is not a single manuscript prior to AD 1544 that has the traditionally accepted 20th year of Tiberius for the death of Philip. This evidence removes the main obstacle for a later date of 1BC for the death of Herod. A list of the oldest manuscripts is found in “Josephus Re-examined”, D. Beyer. Some scholars support the traditional date of 1 BC for Herod&#x27;s death. Filmer and Steinmann, for example, propose that Herod died in 1 BC, and that his heirs backdated their reigns to 4 or 3 BC to assert an overlapping with Herod&#x27;s rule, and bolster their own legitimacy. In Josephus&#x27; account, Herod&#x27;s death was preceded by a lunar eclipse and followed by Passover. An eclipse took place in 4 BC on 13 March, about 29 days before Passover, and this eclipse has been suggested as the one referred to by Josephus. There were however other eclipses during this period, and there are proponents of 5 BC and the two eclipses of 1 BC occurring 10 January and 29 December. Nevertheless, most scholars favour a birth year for Jesus between 6 and 4 BC.

===Subtracting Jesus&#x27; age of &quot;about 30 years&quot; when preaching===
Another approach to estimating Jesus&#x27; year of birth is based on the statement in that he was &quot;about 30 years of age&quot; when starting his ministry. Jesus began to preach after being baptised by John the Baptist, and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in &quot;the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar&quot; (), which scholars estimate to have been in AD 28–29. Subtracting 30 years, it appears that Jesus was born in 1–2 BC. However, if the phrase &quot;about 30&quot; is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.

The benchmark date of AD 28–29 is independently confirmed by John&#x27;s statement () that the Temple reportedly was in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which likewise corresponds to AD 28–29 according to scholarly estimates.

===Other approaches===
The Gospel of mentions in passing an upper limit of 50 for Jesus&#x27; age when preaching: &quot;The Jews therefore said him, art not yet fifty years old, and thou seen Abraham?&quot; Fifty years is a round number which emphasises the discrepancy to Jesus&#x27;s claim he had existed before Abraham, that is, for more than a thousand years.

Some commentators have attempted to establish the date of birth by identifying the Star of Bethlehem with some known astronomical or astrological phenomenon. For example, astronomer Michael Molnar proposed 17 April 6 BC as the likely date of the Nativity, since that date corresponded to the heliacal rising and lunar occultation of Jupiter, while it was momentarily stationary in the constellation of Aries. According to Molnar, to knowledgeable astrologers of this time, this highly unusual combination of events would have indicated that a regal personage would be (or had been) born in Judea. Other research points to a 1991 report from the Royal Astronomical Society, which mentions that Chinese astronomers noted a &quot;comet&quot; that lasted 70 days in the Capricorn region of the sky, in March of 5 BC. Authors Dugard and O&#x27;Reilly consider this event as the likely Star of Bethlehem. However, there are many possible phenomena and none seems to match the Gospel account exactly.

==Years of preaching==

===Reign of Tiberius and the Gospel of Luke===

One method for the estimation of the date of the beginning of the ministry of Jesus is based on the Gospel of Luke&#x27;s specific statement in about the ministry of John the Baptist which preceded that of Jesus:
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
The reign of Tiberius began on the death of his predecessor Augustus in September AD 14, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in late AD 28 or early AD 29. Riesner&#x27;s alternative suggestion is that John the Baptist began his ministry in AD 26 or 27, because Tiberius ruled together with Augustus for two years before becoming the sole ruler. If so, the fifteenth year of Tiberius&#x27; reign would be counted from AD 12. Riesner&#x27;s suggestion is however considered less likely, as all the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius&#x27; rule – namely Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio – count from AD 14 – the year of Augustus&#x27; death. In addition, coin evidence shows that Tiberius started to reign in AD 14.

The New Testament presents John the Baptist as the precursor to Jesus and the Baptism of Jesus as marking the beginning of Jesus&#x27; ministry. In his sermon in , delivered in the house of Cornelius the centurion, Apostle Peter refers to what had happened &quot;throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached&quot; and that Jesus had then gone about &quot;doing good&quot;. Jesus&#x27; baptism account is followed directly by his 40 day fast and ordeal.

===The Temple in Jerusalem and the Gospel of John===
Another method for estimating the start of the ministry of Jesus without reliance on the Synoptic gospels is to relate the account in the Gospel of John about the visit of Jesus to Herod&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem with historical data about the construction of the Temple.

 says that Jesus went to the Temple in Jerusalem around the start of his ministry and in Jesus is told: &quot;This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?&quot;.

Herod&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem was an extensive and long term construction on the Temple Mount, which was never fully completed even by the time it was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70. Having built entire cities such as Caesarea Maritima, Herod saw the construction of the Temple as a key, colossal monument. The dedication of the initial temple (sometimes called the inner Temple) followed a 17 or 18 month construction period, just after the visit of Augustus to Syria.

Josephus () states that the temple&#x27;s reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign. But there is some uncertainty about how Josephus referred to and computed dates, which event marked the start of Herod&#x27;s reign, and whether the initial date should refer to the inner Temple, or the subsequent construction. Hence various scholars arrive at slightly different dates for the exact date of the start of the Temple construction, varying by a few years in their final estimation of the date of the Temple visit. Given that it took 46 years of construction, the best scholarly estimate for when Jesus preached is around the year AD 29.

===Josephus&#x27; reference to John the Baptist===
Both the gospels and first-century historian Flavius Josephus, in his work &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, refer to Herod Antipas killing John the Baptist, and to the marriage of Herod and Herodias, establishing two key connections between Josephus and the biblical episodes. Josephus refers to the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas and that Herodias left her husband to marry Herod Antipas, in defiance of Jewish law.

Josephus and the gospels differ, however, on the details and motives, e.g. whether the execution was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in , ), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in .

The exact year of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias is subject to debate among scholars. While some scholars place the year of the marriage in the range AD 27–31, others have approximated a date as late as AD 35, although such a late date has much less support. In his analysis of Herod&#x27;s life, Harold Hoehner estimates that John the Baptist&#x27;s imprisonment probably occurred around AD 30–31. The &quot;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia&quot; estimates the death of the Baptist to have occurred about AD 31–32.

Josephus stated () that the AD 36 defeat of Herod Antipas in the conflicts with Aretas IV of Nabatea was widely considered by the Jews of the time as misfortune brought about by Herod&#x27;s unjust execution of John the Baptist. Given that John the Baptist was executed before the defeat of Herod by Aretas, and based on the scholarly estimates for the approximate date of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias, the last part of the ministry of John the Baptist and hence parts of the ministry of Jesus fall within the historical time span of AD 28–35, with the later year 35 having the least support among scholars.

==Date of crucifixion==
===Prefecture of Pontius Pilate===
All four canonical gospels state that Jesus was crucified during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Roman Judaea.

In the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (written about AD 93), Josephus states () that Jesus was crucified on the orders of Pilate. Most scholars agree that while this reference includes some later Christian interpolations, it originally included a reference to the execution of Jesus under Pilate.

In the second century the Roman historian Tacitus in &quot;The Annals&quot; (c. AD 116), described the persecution of Christians by Nero and stated () that Jesus had been executed on the orders of Pilate during the reign of Tiberius (Emperor from 18 September AD 14–16 March AD 37).

According to Flavius Josephus, Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea from AD 26 until he was replaced by Marcellus, either in AD 36 or AD 37, establishing the date of the death of Jesus between AD 26 and AD 37.

===Reign of Herod Antipas===

In the Gospel of Luke, while Jesus is in Pilate&#x27;s court, Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean and thus is under the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas. Given that Herod was in Jerusalem at that time, Pilate decided to send Jesus to Herod to be tried.

This episode is described only in the Gospel of Luke (). While some scholars have questioned the authenticity of this episode, given that it is unique to the Gospel of Luke, the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia states that it fits well with the theme of the gospel.

Herod Antipas, a son of Herod the Great, was born before 20 BC and was exiled to Gaul in the summer of AD 39 following a lengthy intrigue involving Caligula and Agrippa I, the grandson of his father. This episode indicates that Jesus&#x27; death took place before AD 39.

===Conversion of Paul===

Another approach to estimating an upper bound for the year of death of Jesus is the estimation of the date of conversion of Paul the Apostle which the New Testament accounts place some time after the death of Jesus. Paul&#x27;s conversion is discussed in both the Letters of Paul and in the Acts of the Apostles.

In the First Epistle to the Corinthians (), Paul refers to his conversion. The Acts of the Apostles includes three separate references to his conversion experience, in , and .

Estimating the year of Paul&#x27;s conversion relies on working backwards from his trial before Junius Gallio in Achaea, Greece () around AD 51–52, a date derived from the discovery and publication, in 1905, of four stone fragments as part of the Delphi Inscriptions, at Delphi across the Gulf from Corinth. The inscription preserves a letter from Claudius concerning Gallio dated during the 26th acclamation of Claudius, sometime between January 51 and August 52.

On this basis, most historians estimate that Gallio (brother of Seneca the Younger) became proconsul between the spring of AD 51 and the summer of AD 52, and that his position ended no later than AD 53. The trial of Paul is generally assumed to be in the earlier part of Gallio&#x27;s tenure, based on the reference () to his meeting in Corinth with Priscilla and Aquila, who had been recently expelled from Rome based on Emperor Claudius&#x27; expulsion of Jews from Rome, which is dated to AD 49–50.

According to the New Testament, Paul spent eighteen months in Corinth, approximately seventeen years after his conversion. states that Paul went back to Jerusalem fourteen years after his conversion, and various missions (at times with Barnabas) such as those in and appear in the Book of Acts. The generally accepted scholarly estimate for the date of conversion of Paul is AD 33–36, placing the death of Jesus before this date range.

===Astronomical analysis===

====Newton&#x27;s method====

All four Gospels agree to within about a day that the crucifixion was at the time of Passover, and all four Gospels agree that Jesus died a few hours before the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. he died before nightfall on a Friday (; ; ; ). In the official festival calendar of Judaea, as used by the priests of the temple, Passover time was specified precisely. The slaughtering of the lambs for Passover occurred between 3pm and 5pm on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan (corresponding to March/April). The Passover meal commenced at moonrise (necessarily a full moon) that evening, i.e., at the start of 15 Nisan (the Jewish day running from evening to evening) (; ). There is an apparent discrepancy of one day in the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion which has been the subject of considerable debate. In John&#x27;s Gospel, it is stated that the day of Jesus&#x27; trial and execution was the day before Passover ( and ), Hence John places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan. Likewise the Apostle Paul, in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, implies Jesus died on a 14 Nisan (&quot;sacrificed as a Passover lamb&quot;, ), and was resurrected on the Jewish festival of the first fruits, i.e. on a 16 Nisan (). The correct interpretation of the Synoptics is less clear. Thus some scholars believe that all four Gospels place the crucifixion on Friday, 14 Nisan, others believe that according to the Synoptics it occurred on Friday, 15 Nisan. The problem that then has to be solved is that of determining in which of the years of the reign of Pontius Pilate (AD 26–36) the 14th and 15th Nisan fell on a Friday.

In a paper published posthumously in 1733, Isaac Newton considered only the range AD 31–36 and calculated that the Friday requirement is met only on 3 April AD 33 and 23 April AD 34. The latter date can only have fallen on a Friday if an exceptional leap month had been introduced that year, but this was favoured by Newton. In the twentieth century, the standard view became that of J. K. Fotheringham, who in 1910 suggested 3 April AD 33 on the basis of its coincidence with a lunar eclipse. In 1933, António Cabreira, following a similar method, arrived at the same date, as did, in the 1990s, Bradley E. Schaefer and J. P. Pratt. Additionally, according to physicist Colin Humphreys and astronomer W. Graeme Waddington, the lunar Jewish calendar leaves only two plausible dates within the reign of Pontius Pilate for Jesus&#x27; death, and both of these would have been a 14 Nisan as specified in the Gospel of John: Friday, 7 April AD 30, and Friday, 3 April AD 33.

A more refined calculation takes into account that the Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation, following criticism that it is possible to establish the phase of the moon on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze. Including the possibility of a cloudy sky obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the refined calculation states that the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate&#x27;s term of office, on 11 April AD 27. Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate&#x27;s time, which is Newton&#x27;s favoured date of 23 April AD 34. Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD 27 and AD 34 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with , and spring AD 34 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul&#x27;s timeline, confirming Friday, 7 April AD 30, and Friday, 3 April AD 33 as the two feasible crucifixion dates.

====Eclipse method====

A lunar eclipse is potentially alluded to in (&quot;The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come&quot;), as pointed out by Humphreys and Waddington. There was in fact a lunar eclipse on 3 April AD 33, a date which coincides with one of Newton&#x27;s astronomically possible crucifixion dates (see above). Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that in ancient Jerusalem this eclipse would have been visible at moonrise at 6.20pm as a 20% partial eclipse (a full moon with a potentially red &quot;bite&quot; missing at the top left of the moon&#x27;s disc). They propose that a large proportion of the Jewish population would have witnessed this eclipse as they would have been waiting for sunset in the west and immediately afterwards the rise of the anticipated full moon in the east as the prescribed signal to start their household Passover meals. Humphreys and Waddington therefore suggest a scenario where Jesus was crucified and died at 3pm on 3 April AD 33, followed by a red partial lunar eclipse at moonrise at 6.20pm observed by the Jewish population, and that Peter recalls this event when preaching the resurrection to the Jews (). Astronomer Bradley Schaefer agrees with the eclipse date but disputes that the eclipsed moon would have been visible by the time the moon had risen in Jerusalem.

A potentially related issue involves the reference in the Synoptic Gospels to a three-hour period of darkness over the whole land on the day of the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος – the sun was darkened). Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event, other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a solar eclipse, since this could not take place during the full moon at Passover, and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours. In 1983, Humphreys and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the &quot;lunar&quot; eclipse of AD 33. This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as &quot;undefended&quot; and &quot;indefensible&quot;. Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun&#x27;s darkening to have been caused by a &quot;khamsin&quot;, i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.

In a review of Humphreys&#x27; book, theologian William R. Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his lunar eclipse argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony, accepting uncritically statements such as the &quot;three different Passovers in John&quot; and Matthew&#x27;s statement that Jesus died at the ninth hour. He also alleges that Humphreys uses two very dubious sources, namely Pilate&#x27;s alleged letter to Tiberius and the writings of the fifth-century Bishop Cyril of Alexandria, which Humphreys however classifies as forgery or contemporary interpretation indicative of a tradition at the time.

====Double Passover method====

In the crucifixion narrative, the synoptic gospels stress that Jesus celebrated a Passover meal (Mark 14:12ff, Luke 22:15) &quot;before&quot; his crucifixion, which contrasts sharply with the independent gospel of John who is explicit that the official &quot;Jewish&quot; Passover (John 11:55) started at nightfall &quot;after&quot; Jesus&#x27; death. In his 2011 book, Colin Humphreys proposes a resolution to this apparent discrepancy by positing that Jesus&#x27; &quot;synoptic&quot; Passover meal in fact took place two days before John&#x27;s &quot;Jewish&quot; Passover because the former is calculated by the putative original Jewish lunar calendar (itself based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar putatively introduced to the Israelites by Moses in the 13th century BC, and still used today by the Samaritans). The official &quot;Jewish&quot; Passover in contrast was determined by a Jewish calendar reckoning which had been modified during the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BC. This modified Jewish calendar is in use among most Jews today. One basic difference lies in the determination of the first day of the new month: while the Samaritans use the calculated (because by definition invisible) new moon, mainstream Jews use the first observation of the thin crescent of the waxing moon which is on average 30 hours later. The other basic difference lies in the fact that the Samaritan calendar uses a sunrise-to-sunrise day, while the official Jewish calendar uses a sunset-to-sunset day. Due to these differences, the Samaritan Passover is normally one day earlier than the Jewish Passover (and in some years two or more days earlier). The crucifixion year of Jesus can then be calculated by asking the question in which of the two astronomically possible years of AD 30 and AD 33 is there a time gap between the last supper and the crucifixion which is compatible with the gospel timeline of Jesus&#x27; last 6 days. The astronomical calculations show that a hypothetical AD 30 date would require an incompatible Monday Last Supper, while AD 33 offers a compatible Last Supper on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33, followed by a compatible crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD 33.

Given these assumptions he argues that the calculated date of Wednesday, 1 April AD 33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be an anachronism. The calculated chronology incidentally supports John&#x27;s and Paul&#x27;s narratives that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD 33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.

In a review of Humphreys&#x27; book, theologian William R. Telford counters that the separate day schema of the Gospel&#x27;s Holy Week &quot;is an artificial as well as an inconsistent construction&quot;. As Telford had pointed out in his own book in 1980, &quot;the initial three-day structure found in [Mark 11] is occasioned by the purely redactional linkage of the extraneous fig-tree story with the triumphal entry and cleansing of the temple traditions, and is not a chronology upon which one can base any historical reconstructions.&quot;

===Scholarly debate on the hour, day, and year of death===

The estimation of the hour of the death of Jesus based on the New Testament accounts has been the subject of debate among scholars for centuries. Some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o&#x27;clock in the morning.

The consensus of modern scholarship agrees with the four Gospels that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, although a Wednesday crucifixion has also been proposed.

The debate on the date can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the Last Supper takes place on the first night of Passover, defined in the Torah as occurring after daylight on 14 of Nisan, and the crucifixion is on 15 Nisan. However, in the Gospel of John the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover meal and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. John&#x27;s account places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan, since the law mandated the lamb had to be sacrificed between 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm and eaten before midnight on that day. It is problematic to reconcile the chronology presented by John with the Synoptic tradition that the Last Supper was a Passover meal. Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts, although Raymond E. Brown, reviewing these, concluded that they can not be easily reconciled. One involves the suggestion that for Jesus and his disciples, the Passover could have begun at dawn Thursday, while for traditional Jews it would not have begun until dusk that same day. Another is that John followed the Roman practice of calculating the new day beginning at midnight, rather than the Jewish reckoning. However, this Roman practice was used only for dating contracts and leases. D. A. Carson argues that &#x27;preparation of the Passover&#x27; could mean any day of the Passover week. Some have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available. Andreas Köstenberger argues that in the first century time was often estimated to the closest three-hour mark, and that the intention of the author of the Mark Gospel was to provide the setting for the three hours of darkness while the Gospel of John seeks to stress the length of the proceedings, starting in the &#x27;early morning&#x27;&quot; William Barclay has argued that the portrayal of the death of Jesus in the John Gospel is a literary construct, presenting the crucifixion as taking place at the time on the day of Passover when the sacrificial lamb would be killed, and thus portraying Jesus as the Lamb of God. This understanding fits with Old Testament typology, in which Jesus entered Jerusalem to identify himself as the Paschal lamb on Nisan 10 was crucified and died at 3:00 in the afternoon of Nisan 14, at the same time the High Priest would have sacrificed the Paschal lamb, and rose before dawn the morning of Nisan 16, as a type of offering of the First Fruits.

Colin Humphreys&#x27; widely publicised &quot;double passover&quot; astronomical analysis, published in 2011 and outlined above, places the time of death of Jesus at 3pm on 3 April AD 33 and claims to reconcile the Gospel accounts for the &quot;six days&quot; leading up to the crucifixion. His solution is that the synoptic gospels and John&#x27;s gospel use two distinct calendars (the official Jewish lunar calendar, and what is today the Samaritan lunar calendar, the latter used in Jesus&#x27; day also by the Essenes of Qumran and the Zealots). Humphrey&#x27;s proposal was preceded in 1957 by the work of Annie Jaubert, who suggested that Jesus held his Last Supper at Passover time according to the Qumran &quot;solar&quot; calendar. Humphreys rejects Jaubert&#x27;s conclusion by demonstrating that the Qumran solar reckoning would always place Jesus&#x27; Last Supper &quot;after&quot; the Jewish Passover, in contradiction to all four gospels. Instead, Humphreys points out that the Essene community at Qumran additionally used a lunar calendar, itself evidently based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar. Humphreys suggests that the reason why his two-calendar solution had not been discovered earlier is (a) widespread scholarly ignorance of the existence of the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar (used alongside the well-known Egyptian administrative solar calendar, and presumably the basis for the 13th-century BC Jewish lunar calendar), and (b) the fact that the modern surviving small community of Samaritans did not reveal the calculations underlying their lunar calendar (preserving the Egyptian reckoning) to outsiders until the 1960s.

In a review of Humphreys&#x27; book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which &quot;does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise.&quot;

==Resurrection on the third day==
After the crucifixion, the Gospels report the discovery of Jesus&#x27; empty tomb, and subsequently the Gospels and Paul provide accounts of Jesus&#x27; resurrection. A potential chronological contradiction arises in the fact that the resurrection is referred to as happening &quot;on the third day&quot; (e.g. Matt 16:21) whereas elsewhere Matthew (Matt 12:40) states that Jesus would be buried &quot;three days and three nights&quot;. The modern concept of zero as a number was introduced by Indian scholars only in the fifth century AD, so that for example the Gregorian calendar never had a year &quot;AD 0&quot; and instead begins with the year AD 1 which is immediately preceded by 1 BC. Applied to the reckoning of days, in the absence of a day &quot;zero&quot;, that is, using inclusive counting, many modern languages (e.g. Greek, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Welsh) continue referring to two weeks as &quot;fifteen days&quot;, whereas in English, which does observe zero and thus uses exclusive counting, this space of time is referred to as a fortnight. Following general practice at the time, the Gospels employ inclusive counting, highlighted in Mt 27.62–64: 
where Matthew uses &quot;after three days&quot; and &quot;until the third day&quot; interchangeably.

==Ancient estimates==
Other estimates of the chronology of Jesus have been proposed over the centuries:

* Tertullian writes that Jesus was born in the 41st year of Augustus, who reigned 56 years (from 43 BC), and died at the age of 30 on March 25. The figure of &quot;41st&quot; is repeated by Irenaeus and Origen.
* Clement of Alexandria writes that Jesus was born in the 28th year of Augustus, who reigned 43 years (from 30 BC). Both Clement and Tertullian date Jesus&#x27; birth to 3 BC or (more likely) 2 BC, which may just be the result of subtracting 30 years to AD 29, when Jesus began his preaching, as he was said to be &quot;around 30 years&quot; of age.
* Hippolytus, states that Jesus was born on Wednesday, December 25, in the 42nd year of Augustus, 5500 years after Adam; and he died in his 33rd year of life on Friday, March 25, in the 18th year of Tiberius, on the consulship of Rufus and Rubellius [AD 29]. The 42nd year of Augustus refers to either 3 BC or 2 BC. However, this does not match the &quot;33rd year&quot; figure, which would place Jesus&#x27; birth in 4 BC. The year AD 29 was Tiberius&#x27; 16th year, not his 18th, although it is sometimes argued that some authors dated his reign from AD 12, when he was made co-regent by Augustus. There is much confusion regarding the reckoning of Tiberius&#x27; reign. December 25 was a Wednesday in 3 BC, and March 25 was a Friday in AD 29.
* The &quot;Liber Generationis&quot;, a work found alongside Hippolytus work, states that Jesus lived 30 years and gives an interval of 206 between the Passion and the &quot;present day&quot;, which was the year 5738 after Adam, the 13th of Severus Alexander [AD 234]. This implies a birth date of 3 BC.

Eusebius, in his &quot;Historia Ecclesiae&quot; first published in AD 313, places the birth of Jesus in the 42nd year of Augustus (who ruled 57 years in total), which is also the 28th year after the death of Antony and Cleopatra; this gives 2 BC. The 3rd/4th century Roman historian Lactantius states that Jesus was crucified on 23 March AD 29, while the 5th century writer Cassiodorus states that Jesus was born in 3 BC and died in AD 31.

=== Anno Domini ===

In AD 525 Dionysius Exiguus devised an Easter table to calculate the dates of Easter at a time when Julian calendar years were still being identified by naming the consuls who held office that year — Dionysius himself stated that the &quot;present year&quot; was &quot;the consulship of Probus Junior&quot;, which was 525 years &quot;since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus&#x27; incarnation occurred 525 years earlier. Bonnie J. Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or incarnation. Among the sources of confusion are:
* In modern times, incarnation is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as Bede, considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
* The civil or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).
* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.
* There were confused summations of emperors&#x27; regnal years.

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus&#x27;s birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was &quot;about thirty years old&quot; shortly after &quot;the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar&quot;, and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.

The Anglo-Saxon historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius, used &quot;Anno Domini&quot; dating in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, completed in AD 731. Both Dionysius and Bede regarded &quot;Anno Domini&quot; as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but &quot;the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation was identified with Christ&#x27;s conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25&quot;. On the continent of Europe, &quot;Anno Domini&quot; was introduced as the calendrical system of choice of the Carolingian Renaissance by the English cleric and scholar Alcuin in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor Charlemagne and his successors popularizing this calendar throughout the Carolingian Empire ultimately lies at the core of the calendar&#x27;s global prevalence today.

<text>Peter of Bruys (also known as Pierre De Bruys or Peter de Bruis; &quot;fl.&quot; 1117 – c.1131) was a medieval French religious teacher. He was called a heresiarch (leader of a heretical movement) by the Roman Catholic Church because he opposed infant baptism, the erecting of churches and the veneration of crosses, the doctrine of transubstantiation and prayers for the dead. An angry Roman Catholic mob murdered him in or around 1131.

Information on Peter of Bruys is derived from two extant sources, the treatise of Peter the Venerable against his followers and a passage written by Peter Abelard.

==Life and teachings==
Sources suggest that Peter was born at Bruis, in southeastern France. The history of his early life is unknown, but he was a Roman Catholic priest who had been deprived of his office by the Church hierarchy for teaching unorthodox doctrine. He began his preaching in Dauphiné and Provence, probably between 1117 and 1120. The local bishops, who oversaw the dioceses of Embrun, Die, and Gap, suppressed his teachings within their jurisdictions.

In spite of the official repression, Peter&#x27;s teachings gained adherents at Narbonne, Toulouse and in Gascony.

Peter was influenced by some of the teachings of an earlier reformer from Italy named Gundolfo, especially in his teaching that salvation can be found outside of the official church and within reading the gospels and adopting their principals.

Peter admitted the doctrinal authority of the Gospels in their literal interpretation but considered the other New Testament writings to be valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself.

Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead and organ music.

==Treatise of Peter the Venerable==
In the preface to his treatise that attacked Peter of Bruys, Peter the Venerable summed up the five teachings that he saw as the errors of the Petrobrusians. Also known as Peter of Montboissier, he was an abbot and an important religious writer who became a popular figure in the church, an internationally-known scholar and an associate of many national and religious leaders of his day.
The first &quot;error&quot; was their denial &quot;that children, before the age of understanding, can be saved by the baptism... According to the Petrobrusians, not another&#x27;s, but one&#x27;s own faith, together with baptism, saves, as the Lord says, &#x27;He who will believe and be baptized will be saved, but he who will not believe will be condemned.&#x27;&quot; That idea ran counter to the medieval Church&#x27;s teaching, particularly in the Latin West, following the theology of Augustine, in which the baptism of infants and children played an essential role in their salvation from the ancestral guilt of original sin.

The second error charged (with some exaggeration) was that the Petrobrusians said, &quot;Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected... The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, &#x27;It is unnecessary to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in the unity of the believers assembled.&#x27;&quot; On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God and believed it to be appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.

The third error enumerated by Peter the Venerable was that the Petrobrusians &quot;command the sacred crosses to be broken in pieces and burned, because that form or instrument by which Christ was so dreadfully tortured, so cruelly slain, is not worthy of any adoration, or veneration or supplication, but for the avenging of his torments and death it should be treated with unseemly dishonor, cut in pieces with swords, burnt in fire.&quot; That was seen as an iconoclastic heresy and as acts of sacrilege by the medieval Church and still is by Catholics today.

The fourth error, according to Peter the Venerable, was that the Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace, rejecting the rite of Communion entirely, let alone the doctrine of the Real Presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation: &quot;They deny, not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord, daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament, but declare that it is nothing at all, and ought not to be offered to God. They say, &#x27;Oh, people, do not believe the bishops, priests, or clergy who seduce you; who, as in many things, so in the office of the altar, deceive you when they falsely profess to make the body of Christ and give it to you for the salvation of your souls.&#x27;&quot; The term, transubstantiation, used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, was first used by Hildebert de Lavardin in about 1079. The theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys. Less than two centuries later, in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary, orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist.

The fifth error was that &quot;they deride sacrifices, prayers, alms, and other good works by the faithful living for the faithful dead, and say that these things cannot aid any of the dead even in the least... The good deeds of the living cannot profit the dead, because transferred from this life their merits cannot be increased or diminished, because beyond this life, there is no longer place for merits, only for retribution. Nor can a dead man hope to gain from anybody that which he did not obtain while alive in the world. Therefore those things are pointless that are done by the living for the dead, because they are mortal and have passed by death beyond the way for all flesh, into the state of the future world, and took with them all their merit, to which nothing can be added.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
As Peter the Venerable recorded, crosses were singled out for special iconoclasm. Peter of Bruys felt that crosses should not deserve veneration. Crosses became for the Petrobrusians objects of desecration and were destroyed in bonfires. In or around the year 1131, Peter was publicly burning crosses to barbecue meat on Good Friday, in St Gilles, near Nîmes. The local populace, angered by Peter&#x27;s sacrileges and offensive provocations, cast him into the flames of his own bonfire.
Henry of Lausanne, a former Cluniac monk, adopted the Petrobrusians&#x27; teachings about 1135 and spread them in a modified form after Peter&#x27;s death.

His teachings continued to be frequently condemned by the Roman Catholic Church, meriting mention at the Second Lateran Council in 1139.

Henry of Lausanne&#x27;s followers became known as Henricians. Both the Henrician and the Petrobrusian sects began to die out in 1145, the year St Bernard of Clairvaux began preaching for a return to Roman orthodoxy in southern France. In a letter to the people of Toulouse, written at the end of 1146, Bernard calls upon them to extirpate the last remnants of the heresy.

As late as 1151, however, some Henricians still remained active in Languedoc. In that year, the Benedictine monk and English chronicler Matthew Paris related that a young girl who claimed to be miraculously inspired by the Virgin Mary was reputed to have converted a great number of the disciples of Henry of Lausanne. The sects both disappear from the historical record after that reference.

Peter is considered a forerunner of the Protestant Reformation by some evangelical Protestants and Anabaptists.

<text>The Central India Agency was created in 1854, by amalgamating the Western Malwa Agency with other smaller political offices which formerly reported to the Governor-General of India. The agency was overseen by a political agent who maintained relations of the Government of India with the princely states and influence over them on behalf of the Governor-General. The headquarters of the agent were at Indore.

== Post-independence ==
Upon the British withdrawal from India in 1947, the rulers of the princely states in this area all chose to accede to the new Union of India. The eastern portion of Central India Agency, including Bagelkhand and Bundelkhand agencies, became the new state Vindhya Pradesh. The western portion, including Bhopal, Malwa, and Bhopawar agencies and the Gwalior and Indore residencies, became the new state of Madhya Bharat. Bhopal became a separate state. Makrai was transferred to Madhya Pradesh, which had been created from the former Central Provinces and Berar in 1950. In 1956, the states of Vindhya Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh. Later another state, Chhattisgarh, was formed from the area that was formerly Madhya Pradesh.

<text>The Project Management Institute (PMI, legally Project Management Institute, Inc.) is a U.S.-based not-for-profit professional organization for project management.

== Overview ==
PMI serves more than five million professionals including over 680,000 members in 217 countries and territories around the world, with 304 chapters and 14,000 volunteers serving local members in over 180 countries.

Its services include the development of standards, research, education, publication, networking opportunities in local chapters, hosting conferences and training seminars, and providing accreditation in project management.

PMI has recruited volunteers to create industry standards, such as &quot;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge&quot;, which has been recognized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). In 2012 ISO adapted the project management processes from the &quot;PMBOK Guide&quot; 4th edition.

== History ==
In the 1960s project management as such began to be used in the US aerospace, construction, and defense industries. The Project Management Institute was founded by Ned Engman (McDonnell Douglas Automation), James Snyder, Susan Gallagher (SmithKline &amp; French Laboratories), Eric Jenett (Brown &amp; Root), and J Gordon Davis (Georgia Institute of Technology) at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1969 as a nonprofit organization. It was incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania in the same year. PMI described its objectives in 1975 as to &quot;foster recognition of the need for professionalism in project management; provide a forum for the free exchange of project management problems, solutions, and applications; coordinate industrial and academic research efforts; develop common terminology and techniques to improve communications; provide an interface between users and suppliers of hardware and software systems; and to provide guidelines for instruction and career development in the field of project management.&quot;

In the 1970s standardization efforts represented 10 to 15 percent of the institute&#x27;s efforts. The functions were performed through the Professional Liaison Committee which called on and coordinated with the Technology, Research Policy, and Education Committees. The institute participated in national activities through the American National Standards Committee XK 36.3 and internationally, through liaison with an appointed observer to Europe&#x27;s International Project Management Association, then called INTERNET. PMI did not deal with the US federal government directly; several members were federal employees in agencies involved with project management.

In the 1980s, efforts were made to standardize project management procedures and approaches. The PMI produced the first Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) in 1996.

In the late 1990s, Virgil R. Carter became president of the PMI. In 2002 Carter was succeeded by Gregory Balestrero, who directed the institute until his retirement in January 2011. He was succeeded as President and CEO by Mark A. Langley. From March 2019 through December 2021 the president and CEO was Sunil Prashara. Pierre Le Manh was appointed CEO on September 1, 2022.

== Certifications ==
Launched in 1984, PMI&#x27;s first credential was the PMP. It has since become a de facto standard certification in project management. In 2007 it earned the ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). , over one million people held the PMP credential.

PMI later introduced other certifications. Credential holders do not have to be members of PMI.

To initially obtain a PMI credential, candidates must first document that they have met the required education and experience requirements. They must then pass an examination consisting of multiple-choice questions. To maintain most PMI credentials, holders must earn Professional Development Units (PDUs), which can be earned in a variety of ways such as taking classes, attending PMI global congresses, contributing to professional research, or writing and publishing papers on the subject. Most credentials must be renewed every three years. These are the certifications and credentials offered by PMI:

* 1984: Project Management Professional (PMP)
* 2003: Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)
* 2007: Program Management Professional (PgMP)
* 2008: PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP)
* 2008: PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP)
* 2011: PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)
* 2014: PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA)
* 2014: Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP)
* 2020: PMI Project Management Ready
* 2020: Disciplined Agile Scrum Master (DASM) 
* 2021: Disciplined Agile Senior Scrum Master (DASSM) 
* 2021: Disciplined Agile Value Stream Consultant (DAVSC) 
* 2021: Disciplined Agile Coach (DAC)

PMI also provided a Certified OPM3 Professional credential which was officially discontinued on March 1, 2017. PMI no longer allows the use of the credential&#x27;s designation by individuals who formerly obtained it. OPM3, even though no longer neither a credential nor a publication, remains a registered mark of PMI.

== Standards ==
The standards PMI develops and publishes fall into three main categories:
* Foundational Standards. These standards provide a foundation for project management knowledge and represent the four areas of the profession: project, program, portfolio, and the organizational approach to project management. They are the foundation on which practice standards and industry-specific extensions are built. According to PMI, standards are developed by volunteers in an open, consensus-based process including a public exposure draft process that allows the standard draft to be viewed and changes suggested.
* Practice Standards and Frameworks. Practice standards describe the use of a tool, technique, or process identified in the PMBOK® Guide or other foundational standards. 
* Practice Guides. Practice guides provide supporting information and instruction to help one apply PMI&#x27;s standards. Practice guides may become potential standards and if so, would undergo the process for the development of full consensus standards.

Here is a list of the current standards or guides in each category:

<doc id="903867" wikidata="Q1469337" url="?curid=903867" title="Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville – Esplanade de la Libération">
<text>The Place de l&#x27;Hôtel-de-Ville – Esplanade de la Libération is a public square in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, located in front of the Hôtel de Ville. Before 1802, it was called the Place de Grève. The French word &quot;grève&quot; refers to a flat area covered with gravel or sand situated on the shores or banks of a body of water.

==The Place de Grève==
===Early history===
The location presently occupied by the square was the point on the sandy right bank of the river Seine where the first riverine harbor of Paris was established.

===Middle Ages===
Later it was used as a public meeting-place and also as a location where unemployed people gathered to seek work. This circumstance accounts for the current French expressions, &quot;être en grève&quot; (to be on strike) and &quot;faire (la) grève&quot; (to go on strike). In 1244 Louis IX of France ordered 24 cartloads of Talmud manuscripts to be burned at the square.

===Royal Execution Grounds===
The principal reason why the Place de Grève is remembered is that it was the site of most of the public executions in early Paris. The gallows and the pillory stood there.

The highest-profile executions took place on the &quot;grève&quot;, including the gruesome deaths of the assassins François Ravaillac and Robert-François Damiens, as well as the bandit-rebel Guy Éder de La Fontenelle. In 1310 the Place de Grève was also the site of the execution of the Beguine heretic Marguerite Porete. On 22 February 1680, the famous French fortune teller, poisoner and alleged sorceress La Voisin was burned to death in the square.

===The French Revolution===

On September 14, 1788, anti-monarchy protests renewed, and in October 1788, protestors demanded money for fireworks; they also demanded that anyone in a carriage dismount and salute to Henri IV, and they burned effigies representing Breteuil, as well as Calonne and the Duchesse de Polignac. They then proposed burning Marie Antoinette in effigy, but the troops were deployed and they dispersed the crowds with great bloodshed in the Place de Grève.

Later on, the Place de Grève saw the first use of the guillotine, when robber Nicolas Jacques Pelletier was decapitated on 25 April 1792. Other notable executions included Charlotte Corday, Jean-Baptiste Carrier, and Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville.

==Location==
The southern end of the Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville, the end closer to the river, is on the right-bank side of the Pont d&#x27;Arcole, which crosses eighty metres of water to reach the island, Île de la Cité, in the middle of the Seine. At this point on the riverbank, the Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville is formed by the convergence of three streets: two quays on the river, Quai de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville, and Quai de Gesvres, and the Rue de Renard. The Rue de Renard, which passes in front of the Paris city hall, the Hôtel de Ville de Paris, forfeits its name for one city block, adopting instead &quot;Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville&quot; addresses.

==Metro station==
The Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville is served by the Hôtel de Ville station of the Paris Métro, on lines 1 and 11.

<doc id="903875" wikidata="Q370938" url="?curid=903875" title="Willy Burkhard">
<text>Willy Burkhard (17 April 1900 – 18 June 1955) was a Swiss composer and academic teacher, influential in both capacities. He taught music theory at the Berne Conservatory and the Zürich Conservatory. His works include an opera, oratorios, cantatas, and many instrumental genres from piano pieces to symphonies.

== Life ==
Burkhard was born in Evilard, Canton of Bern. He attended and graduated from a teachers&#x27; training college . He also study with Ernst Graf, organist at the Berner Münster. He moved to Leipzig to study piano with Robert Teichmüller and composition with Sigfrid Karg-Elert. After Leipzig, he moved on to Munich to study with Walter Courvoisier and later to Paris to work with Max d&#x27;Ollone.

From 1924, he began teaching composition, theory and the piano in Berne. He was appointed professor at the in 1928. He conducted several choirs and small orchestras there. In 1932 he was struck with tuberculosis, and was compelled to live for several years in Montana and Davos. During that time, he turned more towards composition. He settled in Zürich in 1942 and taught composition and music theory at the Zürich Conservatory, where his students included Klaus Huber, Rudolf Kelterborn, Ernst Pfiffner, Armin Schibler and . In 1950 he received a prize from the Schweizerischer Tonkünstlerverein (Swiss Association of Musicians). He died in Zürich in 1955 at the age of 55.

== Work ==
Burkhard published 98 works with Opus numbers, and left a large amount of unpublished works held as manuscripts by the . He began to compose in late-Romantic style. His personal style developed from 1930, comparable to Paul Hindemith and Frank Martin. Late in life, he used some features of twelve-tone composition, but remained within tonality. He was interested to compose for voices, and regarded for renovated sacred music.

Burkhard is known for sacred choral music, including oratorios &quot;Das Gesicht Jesajas&quot; (Isaiah&#x27;s vision) and &quot;Das Jahr&quot; (The year), and the cantata &quot;Die Sintflut&quot; (&quot;The Flood&quot;). He composed an opera, &quot;Die Schwarze Spinne&quot; based on Gotthelf&#x27;s novella &quot;The Black Spider&quot;. He wrote song settings for solo voice and choirs, chamber music and piano works.

<doc id="903878" wikidata="Q1150087" url="?curid=903878" title="Toyota Corona">
<text>The is an automobile manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota across eleven generations between 1957 and 2001. On launch, the Corona was Toyota&#x27;s second-highest product in their range, just below the Crown. The Corona was marketed in the JDM at Toyota&#x27;s &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; dealership channels, and the Corona was one of Toyota&#x27;s first models exported to other global markets, followed by the smaller Toyota Corolla. 

The Corona played a key role in Toyota&#x27;s North American success. Having previously entered the North American passenger car market in 1957 as &quot;Toyopet&quot;, the company met little success, withdrawing in 1961. The company re-entered the North American market in June 1964, rebranded as &quot;Toyota&quot;, introducing its third-generation Corona with more modern technology and numerous standard features. Toyota advertised the car prominently, with the company&#x27;s first television commercial featuring the Corona. The car was well received, winning the 1969 &quot;Road Test&quot; Import Car of the Year. The Corona helped boost U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase), making the company the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. In 2014, editors at &quot;Car and Driver&quot; called the Corona one of the best Toyotas ever made, arguing that Toyota survived long enough to thrive in America because of the Corona. 

By 1968, the Corona name was used on a larger platform, marketed as the Corona Mark II. The Corona itself was marketed under numerous nameplates worldwide, including in European markets as Carinas, and a variant of the Corona was offered in various markets as the Carina. The Corona was ultimately replaced in Japan by the Toyota Premio; in Europe by the Toyota Avensis; and in Asia, Pacific markets, and the Americas by the Toyota Camry.

The nameplate &quot;&quot; derives from the Latin word for &quot;crown&quot;, the sedan taking its place just below Toyota&#x27;s similarly named flagship, the Toyota Crown. 

== First generation (T10; 1957) ==
The first-generation Corona, introduced in May 1957 and became available on the market two months later, was designed with parts from the previous-generation Crown and Master following a major restyle and enlargement of the Crown. The design of many of the body panels were cut down from the Master which had ceased production. Aside from the 4-door T10 sedan, the T16V 3-door van version was introduced in October 1958 as Toyopet Coronaline. Originally, the T10/16 Corona was fitted with the old sidevalve &quot;S&quot; engine, with . In April 1958 the Corona underwent a light facelift, with a new bonnet ornament and door handles. The tail light design of this generation is reminiscent of the 1949 Ford sedan.

The OHV P series engine replaced the old S in October 1959, and offered substantially more power with at 5,000 rpm. The P-engined Corona sedan was capable of traveling at , higher than the old S-engined model. The car also underwent another facelift, including a mesh grille and a new rear seat which allowed seating for five rather than the previous four. As regulations regarding taxis at the time required engines no larger than , dealers restricted the power for taxi vehicles. Due to the upgrade in dimensions of the Crown, Toyota needed to continue manufacturing a vehicle with similar size dimensions to the first Crown, primarily to be used for taxi usage. This vehicle was also the first Toyota&#x27;s car with a monocoque chassis structure, and an independent front suspension using double wishbones. Due to the monocoque chassis, Toyota was able to produce a vehicle under .

== Second generation (T20, T30; 1960) ==
This generation of the Corona was also known as the Tiara (in keeping with the crown naming convention) when exported by Toyota Motor Corporation. It was introduced at a critical time for the company in North America. Their first flagship car, the Toyopet Crown, was unsuccessful in the US market, and the Corona was added to offer a choice along with the Land Cruiser. At the time, there was little market for an off-road vehicle like the Land Cruiser. The front mask of the T20 Corona is reminiscent of the 1955–1957 Ford Thunderbird, and shares its appearance with the entry-level offering, called the Toyota Publica.

The Tiara was introduced to sell alongside the Crown, as a smaller companion. Introduced in March 1960, the car was powered by a 1.0 L &quot;P&quot; series motor. With a three-speed manual transmission, top speed was a mere . In March 1961, Toyota introduced a more powerful 1.5-litre &quot;R&quot; series motor, the same motor from the Crown, and an even larger 1.9-litre engine was added in 1964. Fortunately for Toyota, the problems with the Crown were not seen on the Tiara as the lighter body ( less than the Crown) made the R series engine more sufficient. The Tiara station wagon was seemingly aimed at women, with many of the original brochures featuring only women in a dinner dress as well as playing golf. Nevertheless, it sold better than the Crown and had a lot fewer mechanical problems. The Tiara ended up being the only sedan sold by Toyota in the US until the reworked second-generation Crown appeared. By that time, the Tiara had been redesigned and given the Corona label from the Japanese domestic market. A total of only 318 of these vehicles were sold in the US.

In Australia the Tiara was produced in Port Melbourne, Victoria by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) starting from 1963.

Two concept cars were shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show – the Corona 1500S Convertible and the Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan. The Corona Sports Coupe was a concept car shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show – it shared little with the Corona except the suspension and the name. The load carrying variants, Coronaline van and pickup (technically a coupé utility) were introduced in July and September 1960 with rigid axle semi-oval leaf spring rear suspension and 500 kg payload capacity, to fill commercial segment below the heavier capacity Toyota Stout.

== Third generation (T40, T50; 1964) ==
The third generation was introduced September 1964, one month before the 1964 Summer Olympics. It was available in sedan, two-door hardtop, three-door van, five-door station wagon (also as a van), two coupé utility variants and a five-door hatchback. The 40–43 series were reserved for sedans, while commercial vehicles (and wagons) were in the 46 and 47 series. Hardtops received 50–55 series model codes, while 56 was reserved for the five-door hatchback. 
The 1965 model marked a return of Toyota to the American market after withdrawing there temporarily in 1961.

Toyota conducted a public demonstration of the new Corona&#x27;s performance on the Meishin Expressway, where the new model was tested to , and was able to sustain speeds of . Toyota released the Corona one year after the debut of the Corona&#x27;s traditional competitor, the Nissan Bluebird. In November 1966, Toyota introduced the Corolla, a smaller vehicle to address the market that needed a more fuel efficient vehicle, allowing the Corona to increase in size. time was 15.1 seconds.

Originally, commercial models (three-door van, coupé utility, and double-cab coupé utility) utilized the 1,198 cc 2P engine, with at 5,000 rpm. This allowed for a maximum load of for the two-seater versions and for the five-seaters. Heavier loads were better accommodated by the Toyota Stout, while larger commercial grade trucks became available at &quot;Toyota Diesel Store&quot; locations. 1967 also saw the debut of a cab over van equipped for both commercial and commuting duties using the Corona engines, called the Toyota HiAce, offering more payload than the Corona was suited for.

The coupé utility was produced by the former Central Motors between October 1964 and August 1968. In July 1965 the 2-door hardtop coupé body style was introduced.

Top speed for the 1.2-litre Corona is . In January 1967 this also became available as a five-door van. In April 1967, the larger and more powerful 3P (1.35-litre) and 2R (1.5-litre) engines became available, replacing the lesser 2P in most markets. Power of these were respectively.

The Toyota automatic transmission, marketed as &quot;Toyoglide&quot;, was introduced on this version of the Corona. The 4R (12R in Australian versions) engine that had a displacement of 1587 cc was equipped with a twin SU carburetor (Australian models with 12R engine had one double barrel Aisin downdraft carburetor), and was capable of . Disc brakes were also introduced for the front wheels. Exports of this Corona proved popular in the US and Europe, with increased engine performance and durability improvements over previous versions. In September 1967 alone, Toyota produced 80,000 cars, with 30,000 being Coronas.

===Toyota 1600GT (RT55)===
In August 1967 Toyota installed the DOHC 9R engine in the RT55 1600GT. This engine used the 4R engine block borrowed from the Corona 1600S with a Yamaha built DOHC head derived from the 2.0 L &quot;3M&quot; engine in the exotic 2000GT that was introduced May 1967, and produced . The 1600GT was offered as a more affordable junior version of the larger, more exclusive 2000GT. In production for only 13 months, 2,222 examples of the 1600GT were manufactured in Bellatrix Yellow, Pegasus White, Solar Red, and Thunder Silver metallic – all colours that were also offered on the 2000GT.

The introduction of a two-door hardtop coupe reflected the growing prosperity of the Japanese economy. While the coupé offered some practical items like a spacious trunk and a rear seatback that folded down for additional items, it was offered as a single-occupant car that could accommodate three other passengers. A bench seat was not offered for front-seat passengers, and a console was blended into the dashboard, accommodating 4-speed or optional 5-speed. Due to its sporting nature, no automatic transmission was offered, and a limited slip differential was standard equipment. The interior only came in black, with reclining front bucket seats. The steering wheel matched the one used in the 2000GT, but the outer rim was wood-grained plastic. It was Toyota&#x27;s answer to the Isuzu Bellet GT, the Nissan Bluebird SSS and the Prince Skyline 2000GTB. While it used the Corona hardtop coupé body, it was not known as the Corona 1600GT, sharing a naming convention to the larger 2000GT.

It inspired future generations of performance-oriented coupes and sports cars offered, to begin with the Crown hardtop coupé in October 1968, the Corona Mark II GSS, the Celica GT, and the Carina GT in 1970 and the Toyota Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno in 1972, while a 2.0-litre DOHC engine continued to be offered in subsequent Corona GT coupés until 1983. On the front fenders, grilles were installed, and the inverted triangle found on the grille of the 2000GT is also installed on the 1600GT&#x27;s grille.

=== Foreign assembly ===
The Corona was the first Toyota assembled in New Zealand, from February 1967 at Steel Brothers&#x27; Motor Assemblies in Christchurch. It was also built by Shinjin Motor in South Korea from 1966 until 1972. Shinjin Motor was a predecessor to Daewoo and soon switched to assembling General Motors products. The Corona was also assembled by Australian Motor Industries in Melbourne, with the 12R engine.

South African assemblies commenced in 1966, with the car reaching a fifteenth position on the 1967 sales charts.

=== Corona Mark II (T60, T70; 1968) ===

September 1968 saw the release of a larger model called the Corona Mark II. It was a slightly larger vehicle than the Corona with a higher level of equipment offered at the time, sharing some of the features of the larger Crown, but taking the top position at &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations.

The Corona Mark II is longer, at over the Corona&#x27;s length of for the sedan, and the coupe, with a width of in comparison to for the sedan and coupe. The height of the Mark II is lower at over for the sedan, but higher at for the coupé.

After 1972, this was spun off as a separate platform, eventually dispensing with the &quot;Corona&quot; part of the name.

== Fourth generation (T80, T90; 1970) ==
The T80 series Corona was introduced February 1970 and was a complete redesign, and was developed on a separate platform from the Toyota Corona Mark II, which became a larger, more comfortable and powerful car, where the Corona remained focused on fuel economy. Body styles were further reduced to a two-door hardtop coupé, a four-door sedan and station wagon. The engine continued to use an OHV on base level vehicles, and SOHC on better equipped versions and most of the two-door coupés. The engines used in the Mark II were often shared with the Corona.

Trim levels originally offered were the 1500 standard or DX, 1600 DX, and the 1600 SL (although the 1900 cc 8R engine was offered in North America and South Africa). The 1.5 offered , while the 1.6 has depending on the spec. A slight change occurred in January 1971, when the 2R and 7R engines (RT80/82/86V) were replaced by the more powerful 12R and 6R units (RT81/84/87V). At the same time, the larger 1.9-litre RT83 was added to the lineup. A plethora of transmissions were offered, with a three-speed manual as standard. A four-speed manual with a floor-mounted lever was also available, as were two- or three-speed &quot;Toyoglide&quot; automatic transmissions, with the three-speed available with a floor-mounted shifter. Later on a five-speed manual was also made available in the sportier versions.

The Corona was redesigned in August 1971, with the low-mounted wraparound turn signals removed and a new grille. Another, milder yet restyle appeared in August 1972, including new grilles and hubcaps. The Hardtop gained a two-litre engine at this time. Among the mechanical updates were electronic fuel injection installed on the 18R-E with a SOHC engine design that appeared in the two-door coupé. The 18R-B had twin SU Carburetors, with an electronically controlled automatic transmission, labeled ECT. Four-cylinder engine choices were pushrod 1.35 (van Standard only), 1.5, and 1.6-litre engines, and overhead-cam 1.7, 1.9, and 2.0-litre petrol units. Vans (wagons) were sold with 1.35 3P or 1.5-litre 2R engines for the first year, but the 1.5 was replaced by the 1.6-litre 12R engine in January 1971. The 1.7-litre 6R engine was added to the lineup in September 1970, and became available in the van in September 1971. North America only received the Corona wagon in July 1972 (and only for the 1973 model year), as the two-litre RT89.

A performance oriented in-house competitor called the Toyota Carina, close in size to the Corona and based on the Toyota Celica platform, was introduced in 1970. It was available at a different dealership sales channel called &quot;Toyota Store&quot;. This generation of Corona was available at dealerships called &quot;Toyopet Store&quot;. The Corona pick-up was no longer manufactured due to the introduction of the Hilux in 1969. Along with the August 1972 facelift, the Corona received the 2.0-litre engine which appeared in the 2000SL and the 2000SR with fuel injection. The 7R-engined RT82 was short-lived in Japan, only being available between February and September 1970, but in other markets it may have remained available until the introduction of the next Corona.

In the United States, the 1970s were probably the Corona&#x27;s high point, helped by the fuel crises of 1973 and 1979. Competition for sales continued from the Nissan Bluebird, and from a new competitor from the Mazda RX-2 in 1971, with an introduction to the US in 1972. As with the prior generation models offered were limited to the four-door sedan and the hardtop coupe for most of the run, with the wagon added only for 1973, the final model year of the generation.

These models were assembled in New Zealand (by Steel&#x27;s) and Australia (Australian Motor Industries or AMI). NZ models initially had a 1.5-litre OHV engine and four-speed manual and then the 6R 1.7-litre OHC engine. After the first facelift (new nose and tail, square instead of round instrument housings) for 1972, the 6R engine was again used. The 1972 facelift (another new grille) saw two models – 1.6-litre OHV with three-speed column-shift manual and bench front seat and 1.7-litre four-speed floor shift manual and high-back buckets. This version was badged 1700SE.

Australian RT81s used the 1.6-litre OHV engine and four-speed manual. Local content was much higher than the NZ cars with local instruments and heater which meant, surprisingly for the climate, there were no centre air vents. The facelift AMI assembled model with the revised grille was released in November 1972, lasting to March 1974.

A modified Corona was shown at the 1970 Tokyo Motor Show as the Electronics Car. Based on the Corona Hardtop 1700SL, it showed many electronic innovations but was not put into production.


== Fifth generation (T100, T110, T120; 1973) ==
31 August 1973 saw the introduction of the Corona T100-Series, which continued to be built as a two-door or four-door sedans, a two-door hardtop coupé (T110 chassis codes) and as a four-door station wagon (marketed as a van for commercial use in Japan). Chassis codes 100–105 were reserved for sedans, with 106–109 for vans, the 110–115 was for the hardtop coupé while 116–119 was for the wagon versions. The 120-series model codes were used for late-series facelifted models in the Japanese market fitted with the new emissions control TTC-C motors. The two-speed automatic was no longer offered. The facelift revised the bonnet and grille and enlarged the tail lights. The station wagon featured optional wood panel body claddings. Engines were 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0-litre SOHC units. In North America, the 20R 2.2-litre engine was used.

The high-performance 2000GT Sedan and Hardtop Coupé with 18R-G twin cam engine were only offered in Japan. Yamaha supplied the alloy head for these high performance normally aspirated engines fitted with twin Mikuni-Solex 40 mm side-draft carburettors and a compression ratio of 9.7:1. Gearbox was the Porsche-type synchromesh 5-speed P51 coupled to a 4.1 F series limited slip differential, giving a claimed top speed of . In 1972, a new set of performance coupes is introduced on the Corolla platform called the Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno.

North American models had longer bumpers (hiding recoverable bumper shocks) to meet local impact standards; they gained standard radial tires in 1975. Side door impact upgrades were installed in all doors. This series also saw the standard (on some models) Electro Sensor Panel which monitored fluid and bulb status. As with earlier Coronas, some models had a shifter mounted on the steering column. Sales of the Corona continued to grow as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. The two-door hardtop continued, with trim levels 1600GL, 1800SR and the 2000SR, with the coupé proving popular in the US but more popular yet in Japan. The two-door sedan, meanwhile, sold well in the United States but very little in Japan, and this was the last Corona to be offered in this bodystyle.

The Corona saw new competitors in both Japan, Europe and the United States from the Honda Accord in 1976, and the Subaru DL in 1974. The advantage the Honda and Subaru had over the Corona was that both vehicles were front-wheel-drive, while the Corona was rear-wheel-drive. In response to the Japanese Governments passage of emission control regulations, Toyota introduced the Toyota TTC-V (Vortex) on the 19R engine only, using an Exhaust gas recirculation implementation. In Japan, the 12R-U engine was designed to run on LPG for taxi usage, starting in October 1975. To meet new emissions regulations the 1.6-litre 12R engine was replaced by the more modern 2T-J in commercial models. The 18R-E engine with fuel injection that was used in the 2000SL and 2000SR discontinued production due to emission issues. In November 1975, the 1800 saw the removal of the twin carburetors due to emission regulations, which meant the discontinuation of the 1800SR coupé. June 1976 saw the installation of a catalyst system included with the TTC-C system.

January 1977 saw a minor appearance change to both the interior and exterior, with a revised grille and bonnet, new headlight surrounds and a restyled dashboard. The taillights were also modified; while still rectangular, they were less busy in appearance.

New Zealand assembly began with 1.6 OHV, three-speed manual column shift and bench front seat and 1.8-litre 16R OHC four-speed manual bucket front seat options. Later, the 18R 2.0-litre OHC engine replaced the 1.8 and was also offered with a three-speed automatic, the first auto Corona in New Zealand. A later update replaced the 2000 with an upgraded trim version badged 2000SE and wagon assembly commenced.

Australian models had the 18R from the start, as did South African ones.

== Sixth generation (T130; 1978) ==
Introduced in Japan in September 1978, the T130 series Corona adopted a boxier design over the outgoing T100/110/120 series. It maintained the standard front-engine / rear-wheel-drive layout of all Coronas that preceded it. The T130 series was available in a wide range of body styles across various markets including a four-door sedan, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door wagon and new five-door liftback, which featured a 40:60 split fold rear seat. The assignment of &quot;T130&quot; to all Corona body styles signified a new approach from having different series number identifiers for the various body styles. This was also the first Corona to be sold as a &quot;Toyota&quot; rather than a &quot;Toyopet&quot; in the Japanese domestic market.

All models featured MacPherson strut independent front suspension as well as a four-link trailing arm rear suspension arrangement with a Panhard rod, except for the wagon, which used leaf springs, like the Corolla and Cressida wagons. Disc brakes were fitted as standard equipment on the front of all models. Rear disc brakes were fitted as standard on the 2000GT and 2000SL, which were not available to all international markets. Other models were fitted with rear drum brakes.

The Corona range received a thorough facelift in August 1980, with new rearwards sloping rectangular headlights which gave it a more modern appearance at the front.

The T130 series was manufactured with a wide range of engine and transmission combinations. 1.6-litre 12R, 2T (and associated 12T) and 2.0-litre 18R engines are the most common. The LPG-powered 12R engine became available in the Japanese domestic market in February 1979 and, along with the LPG-powered 5R engined model, continued to be built until August 1982. The rest of the Corona range was taken out of production for the Japanese market in December 1981. Amongst other minor changes, the 1.8-litre 3T / 13T engine was added in 1981 to replace the 1.6-litre 2T/12T. The North American Corona shared the 2.2-litre 20R engine with the Celica. Emission regulations passed in 1978 were applied across the range of models offered. The 1.8L engine was equipped with electronic fuel injection as well as the 2.0L engine. In Japan the venerable 2.0L 18R-G was offered in the range-topping 2000GT, developing 101 kW (135 hp) at 5800 rpm.

The station wagon was, as usual at the time, marketed as a &quot;light van&quot; in Japan. This was registered as a commercial vehicle for certain tax benefits and less restrictive emissions standards. When introduced, the Corona Van was available as a 1600 (TT137V) or an 1800 (RT137V), both using engines not installed in the rest of the range. The &quot;2T-J&quot; in the 1600 Standard produces at 6000 rpm while the DX and GL models&#x27; 1.8-litre 16R offered at 5600 rpm but with considerably more torque. The 2T and 16R were both replaced by the newer &quot;12T-J&quot; engine in December 1979, reflecting newly tightened emissions standards for commercial vehicles in Japan. This model, the TT138V, produces at 5600 rpm.

Production of the T130 ended in 1982, to be replaced by the T140 series.

===Markets===
;United States
The T130 was the last Corona to be marketed in the US. It was offered as a sedan, wagon, or liftback with either Base or LE (Luxury Edition) equipment. In North America, the Corona was replaced for the 1983 model year by the similarly sized but front-wheel-drive Camry sedan and five-door hatchback. Since then, the Camry has grown a size larger than the Corona and its sportier Carina sister car. The Corona was originally fitted with the 2.2-litre 20R engine, but along with a facelift for 1981 this was switched to the 2367 cc 22R with at 4800 rpm. The facelift version received a rearward-sloping front end and a modestly restyled rear; North American cars received quad rectangular headlamps and a standard five-speed manual or an optional four-speed automatic.

;Australia
To meet an 85 per cent overall local parts content as a manufacturer, Toyota Australia chose to manufacture Corona sedans and wagons using 1.9-litre Holden &quot;Starfire&quot; engines. As installed by Toyota, the engine received some minor changes in the form of its own camshaft, manifold, and carburettor. In Toyota engine terminology it received &quot;1X&quot; badging and was coupled with a four-speed or optional five-speed Borg-Warner 505. A three-speed automatic was also available. Period commenters universally criticized the antiquated Holden powerplant as rough, lacking power, and excessively thirsty. There was also a very well-equipped Corona XX, recognizable by its alloy wheels (shared with the Supra). In spite of its air of sports and luxury, the Corona XX received the Starfire engine, albeit here only with a five-speed manual.

Beginning in November 1979, Toyota Australia also imported the five-door Corona liftback fitted with Toyota&#x27;s own, much more modern 2.0-litre &quot;18R-C&quot; engine with . In 1981 the Australian Corona received the same facelift as seen elsewhere, with a new rearward sloping front. Toyota&#x27;s engineers also further modified the Holden engine in an effort to increase drivability and reliability, with new gaskets, valves, valve springs, and water pump. Outputs remained the same but the performance did increase marginally thanks to better engine response. The facelifted Corona XX now benefitted from an imported engine, the same 2-litre 21R-C as used in the Celica.

;New Zealand
New Zealand assembly started with the 1.6-litre &quot;12R&quot; engine and three-speed manual transmission with bench front seat, and 1.8-litre &quot;3T&quot; (TT132) with a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic. The 1.6-litre was soon changed to the newer &quot;2T&quot; engine, coupled with a four-speed manual and bucket front seats. Later in the run, Toyota NZ added a locally assembled Liftback version with the 1.8-litre engine and manual or automatic transmission. These models also had a standard radio and separate cassette deck—both were rare factory fittings in the country at the time.

;Indonesia
In Indonesia, the locally built T130 Corona was available as a 2000 (RT132) from 1979. From 1981 it became available as an 1800 (TT132). It was then replaced by the X60-series Toyota Corona Mark II. The Corona returned to Indonesia with the T150-series Corona FF.

== Seventh generation ==
=== Rear-wheel-drive model (T140; 1982) ===
The T140, which would become the longest running Corona series, entered production as a rear-wheel-drive sedan, coupé and wagon in January 1982. Manufacture by Toyota Australia continued until 1987, by which time the T150 series had already been released. The T140 series was also brought out in a diesel/LPG powered, high-roofed taxicab version which was particularly popular in Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. The T140 was not exported to many markets where the T130 had been sold (such as Indonesia), with many importers choosing to hold out for the front-wheel-drive T150.

Starting with this generation series, the Toyota Carina platform was altered from its original Toyota Celica beginnings to the Corona platform. The Corona remained exclusive to Japanese dealerships &quot;Toyopet Store&quot;, and the Carina continued to be sold new only at &quot;Toyota Store&quot; locations in conjunction to the larger Toyota Crown.

For the Japanese market only, the five-door wagon (called &quot;Van&quot;) was available with a 1.5-litre 5K-J petrol engine, a 1.6-litre 12T-J petrol engine or a 1.8-litre 1C diesel engine. The petrol engines had either a 4-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic gearbox but the diesel engine had a 5-speed manual gearbox. Some wagons had five doors but no rear seat.

European export versions received the &quot;2T&quot; four-cylinder, with . There was also an 1.8-litre engine, as well as the 1.8-litre &quot;1C&quot; diesel unit, with a claimed . The T140 Corona was not exported in large numbers to Europe, as most importers focused on the slightly smaller Carina and then the front-wheel-drive T150-series cars.

After the late 1985 introduction of the T160 Corona Coupé, the rear-wheel-drive coupé was discontinued. The sedan range was gradually whittled down and by May 1986 only the 1.5 and 1.8 (3A-U, 1S-U) remained, along with a 1.5 Van (KT147V) and a 1.8 Diesel Van. These continued to be available until the December 1987 introduction of the T170-series Corona.

;Australia
For the Australian market, there were two models sold between 1983 and 1987: the ST141 with a 2.0-litre &quot;2S-C&quot; and from 1984, the RT142, fitted with a 2.4-litre fuel-injected &quot;22R-E&quot;. Both models were available in either sedan or wagon body styles. The lower S and CS trim levels (2.0-litre) were fitted standard with a four-speed manual transmission (optional five-speed manual and three- or four-speed automatic). The top trim level was the 2.0-litre CS-X until November 1984 when replaced by the 2.4-litre CSi and luxury Avante models (2.0- and 2.4-litre).

Toyota released a limited edition Olympic model in 1984, offering a full digital instrument cluster in either manual or automatic and in both sedan and wagon body variants. In 1985, a limited edition SR model was offered in white and manual transmission only with front and rear spoilers, white painted grille and side mirrors, white highlights in the tail lamps (instead of black), SR lettering on the boot lid, red exterior pinstriping, sports front seats with red pin stripes, and a three-spoke leather steering wheel.

Toyota Australia introduced a facelift in November 1985. This included the addition the former CS-X grille insert for the S model and the Avante grille for the CS and CSi. There were also new wheels trims on all versions and revised tail lamp lenses. The pre-facelift models can be identified by tail lamps with dual black horizontal lines engraved along the base. The facelift models received lenses with a single, more subtle, horizontal line intersecting across the centre of the tail lights and a chrome strip at the base. Facelift CS and CSi wagons received a horizontal strip across the tailgate and additional black plastic mouldings surrounding the license plate.

==== Taxi ====
The special-bodied taxi version was a spinoff of the T140, used specially as taxicabs in Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Panama and Singapore. It was first introduced with the 1.8-litre 1C diesel engine in January 1982 (CT140). In September a 1.8-litre LPG version (YT140) was added to the lineup. In addition to getting a new rear end and a taller, more upright roof line for a more comfortable rear seat, alterations were also made to the headlights and grille. While based on the T140, the front and rear sections took their design cues from the A60 Carina. In December 1986 the car underwent a light facelift, and the diesel option was upgraded to the 2-litre 2C version (CT141).

The car was not generally sold for private use. After November 1991, the diesel option was no longer available for the Japanese market but was still available for export (e.g. Macau). Production only came to an end in April 1998, generally being replaced by the S150-series Crown (later renamed Comfort). This marked the end of the Corona taxi line. Most 140/141-series Corona taxis have been long replaced with newer vehicles; it did remain in common use for a long time in both Macau and Pakistan.

=== Front-wheel-drive model (T150; 1983) ===

The T150 Corona was known as the Corona FF, selling alongside the more traditional and recently facelifted rear-wheel-drive Corona (T140-series). Essentially a shortened version of the Camry, this was part of Toyota&#x27;s very cautious approach to introducing front-wheel-drive vehicles. Toyota returned to a platform naming tradition, assigned to different body styles this generation was made available, abandoned in 1978. The Corona FF as introduced in January 1983 was only available with a five-door liftback body style, and only with the carburetted 1.8-litre 1S-LU inline-four. In October 1983 a more traditional four-door sedan was added, and the T150 gradually became the main part of the Corona lineup as the T140-series shrank in importance.

In 1983, the T150 Corona became the first Japanese made car with digital colour liquid crystal gauges.

Along with the new bodystyle, more engines were also added: a smaller 1.5-litre 3A-LU at the bottom, while the 1.8 was now available with fuel injection (1S-ELU) and . There was also a two-litre diesel (2C-L) and the carburetted 1.8 was replaced by the central point injected 1S-iLU, with an extra five horsepower. In 1984, this chassis was also used as the basis for a new, front-wheel-drive version of the Carina sedan.

In August 1985 the Corona underwent a small change, largely consisting of new, bigger taillights. Also new was the related Celica and Carina range. With a more sporting chassis and five-lug wheels (rather than four), this received the new T160 chassis code. This chassis, as well as the twin-cam two-litre 3S-GELU engine with (JIS) at 6400 rpm was used for the new Corona 2.0 GT and GT-R versions. A sporting 1.8 SX-R version (1S-ELU) of the 160-series sedan was also added in late 1985.

;Export markets
The Corona hatchback was eventually dropped in Australia in 1983 in favour of the larger Camry and the previous-generation saloon and estate were dropped in 1987 to be replaced by the Toyota Camry (V20), but in New Zealand, Toyota continued to offer the Corona, assembled locally at Toyota&#x27;s plant in Thames, New Zealand. Initially, the T150 Corona was launched in New Zealand in 1983 as a hatchback only, to complement the previous generation T140 Corona saloon and estate which continued to be sold in the New Zealand market as in Australia. However, the T140 saloon was dropped in 1985 and the T150 Corona saloon was then launched to replace it. With suspension fettled by racer Chris Amon, the New Zealand Coronas had carburetted 1.8s or a fuel-injected 2-litre engine. Later, Toyota New Zealand followed Australia&#x27;s lead and eventually dropped the Corona in 1996, instead marketing the Australian-built Camry as its offering in the mid-size segment of the market.

Export-market Coronas were generally fitted with the 1.6-litre 4A engine, but in many markets (New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Latin America) the T150 Corona was also available with 2.0-litre engines. In Southeast Asia, the 1.6 EX-Saloon with no emissions gear (4A-L) produces at 5600 rpm. In Indonesia, the original T150 was sold as the Corona GL and after the 1985 facelift it became the Corona EX-Saloon (AT151).

Toyota&#x27;s large family car lineup in Europe was quite confusing when looking over the past 25 years. The 1970 through 1983 Carina sister models had been sold in most of Europe, but in 1984 they were replaced with the &quot;Carina II&quot; – which was really the 1983 model Corona as sold in Japan with alterations to the headlights, grille and trim (the Carina in Japan at that time was a similar but boxier vehicle).

=== Corona Coupé (T160; 1985) ===

When the Celica was realigned from its former Toyota &quot;A-series&quot; RWD platform to share the Corona &quot;T-series&quot; FWD platform, the Celica notchback was rebranded as the Corona Coupé in Japan, which was identical to the internationally available Celica version with the only difference being the removal of the retractable headlights in favor of conventional fixed items. This replaced the rear-wheel-drive T140 Corona Coupé, leaving only a few vans and sedans in the RWD Corona lineup. The T160-series cars have a slightly longer wheelbase and a wider track (front and rear) than the Celica version available elsewhere. The Corona Coupé remained exclusive to &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; Japanese dealerships along with the larger, all new Toyota Soarer, while the Celica liftback and convertible remained at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; locations. The Corona Coupé was manufactured from 1985 until 1989 when it was replaced by the Toyota Corona EXiV four-door hardtop coupe. In 1994, the two-door coupe was renamed as the Toyota Curren and sold at &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; locations. The Toyota Soarer was available with the Corona Coupé at &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations, but the Soarer was more popular, and the Corona Coupé was no longer offered.

The Corona Coupé came with three engines; the SOHC 1.8-litre 1S-iLU and two twin-cams, the 1.6-litre 4A-GELU or the 2-litre 3S-GELU. Chassis codes are ST160, AT160, and ST162. In May 1988, the 1.8-litre engine was replaced by the twin-cam 4S-FiLU.

== Eighth generation (T170; 1987) ==
The Corona and the Toyota Carina continued to increase in size, introduced in December 1987. Because of Japanese taxation laws, both models got to the maximum permitted for a lower tax bracket, and in the 1980s and early 1990s, the cars were the same size. The previous generation ST160 Corona Coupé was not renewed with this generation. It did not receive a direct replacement until 1993, when it was renamed as the Toyota Curren. 

For this generation, the all-new Corona EXiV four-door hardtop was offered, as only two-door hardtops were previously available. This was the last generation to offer the Corona GT to Japanese buyers, equipped with Toyota&#x27;s active suspension technology called TEMS included with their &quot;PEGASUS&quot;-branded four-wheel independent suspension and &quot;LASRE&quot;-branded multi-port fuel injection technology on the 3S-GELU engine.

The five-door Corona liftback was sold as the &quot;Corona SF&quot; in Japan, in a much smaller lineup than the four-door sedan. The five-door model proved much more popular in Europe, where, confusingly, it was marketed as the Carina II. The sedan and a wagon were also part of the Carina II lineup, which was a rebadged Corona rather than the T170 Carina sold in Japan. The lightly restyled Carina T170 series derivative was launched in Japan simultaneously with the Corona. In August 1988 a four-wheel-drive Corona was added using All-Trac, powered by the fuel injected, 1.6-litre 4A-FE engine.

In November 1989 the Corona underwent a minor facelift, including a redesigned front grille with densely packed vertical bars rather than the earlier four horizontal ones. The front of the Van remained unchanged. Meanwhile, the taillights and rear fascia were given a horizontal theme and the rear number plate was moved to the bottom of the bumper. The 1.5 and 1.8-litre engines were upgraded to EFI in the 4S-FE and 5A-FE types. Power of the 2.0 GT increased to , requiring unleaded premium petrol. The Select Saloon, previously a special edition, became a regular catalog model in place of the MX version.

A limited production Corona was sold only in Japan in May 1990, to celebrate 10 million Corona&#x27;s having been sold, called the Corona Super Roomy. It added to the wheelbase, and was limited to 500 units.

=== Corona EXiV (T180) ===
The T180 series Corona was introduced as the Toyota Corona EXiV which was shared with a Carina twin, called the Toyota Carina ED. According to Toyota, the letters &quot;EXiV&quot; derived from the words EXtra impressiVe. The Corona EXiV followed from the successes of the Corona Coupé, by introducing a sleek appearance of a low-slung coupé, while adding two more doors, in the tradition of a four-door coupé. Built on the same version of the Corona chassis as that used for the Celica, this was a continuation of the sporting T160 series Corona although it now received its own bodywork.

== Ninth generation (T190; 1992) ==
Introduced in March 1992, the new Corona made its European debut at Geneva Motor Show. In Europe, the Corona was known as the Toyota Carina E and it replaced the Carina II (T170). The Carina E was built at Toyota&#x27;s new factory at Burnaston, near Derby, England, United Kingdom, but the early cars and all GT-i models were built in Tsutsumi, Japan. The cars were imported in Europe from the third quarter of 1992 until the opening of the Burnaston factory in December that year.

For the Japanese domestic market, the Corona&#x27;s platform twin the Carina received different bodywork.

This generation of Corona received a redesign to be larger, heavier, and have the completely rounded, aerodynamic shape of the 1990s. The exterior dimensions and engine sizes remained in compliance with Japanese size regulations so as to continue to offer a product for Japanese buyers wanting to reduce their annual tax liability.

The five-door model was called the Corona SF in Japan, while the station wagon had become a separate line there, from 1993, called the Toyota Caldina.

The T190 is the last Corona for most export markets. It was marketed as Corona &quot;Absolute&quot; in Indonesia, or Corona Exsior in the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand.

In mainland Europe, the Carina E was offered in XL and GL trim levels, but in the UK they were marketed as Xi (1.6-litre), XLi (1.6, 1.8-litre), SLi (1.8-litre), GLi (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), GTi (2.0-litre, no estate) and Executive (2.0-litre, no estate) between 1992 and 1996. Diesels were available as the 2.0-litre XLD and GLD trims. From 1996, the S (1.6-litre, hatchback only), GS (1.6, 1.8-litre), CD (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), and CDX (1.8, 2.0-litre) trims replaced the previous trim level scheme. Diesels were now the 2.0-litre GS and GL trims. The high performance GT-i with 3S-GE engine was offered in small numbers in certain European countries. All versions (apart from GTi/Executive) were available as a four-door saloon, five-door hatchback or five-door estate car. Badged as a Carina, this was the 1993 Semperit Irish Car of the Year.

It was also sold in New Zealand, but not in Australia. The exteriors were the same as the European Carina E. The station wagon variant was a badge-engineered Toyota Caldina and also similar to Carina E. The sedans and liftbacks were assembled in Thames, New Zealand, while the wagon was imported fully built up from Japan. The locally assembled cars also received special spring and damper combinations (again developed by racer Chris Amon) as well as some other changes.

In the Philippines, the Corona was only available with the 2.0-litre &quot;3S-FE&quot; engine throughout its production from 1993 to 1998. Early examples of the Corona T190 (ST191) looks similar to the 1992 Japanese spec model. It only has the 2.0 EX Saloon variant, with a choice of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1995 model has the facelifted exterior, having the front and rear bumpers with the black trim, and the standard three-piece rear spoiler. The Exsior was introduced in 1996, this time with extended bumpers and red/amber tail lights and garnish. Another variant of the Corona Exsior was the LE, which had genuine leather seats, faux dash wood panel, and electronic air purifier/ionizer as standard equipment.

Production in Japan ended in 1995, but in Europe it lasted until the end of 1997, when it was replaced by the Avensis, which was also built at Burnaston. It lasted until in 1998 for Southeast Asian market and then replaced with the Toyota Camry (XV20).

=== Corona EXiV (T200) ===
The T200 series Corona was sold as the continuation of the Toyota Corona EXiV hardtop sedan, while the Corona Coupé&#x27;s successor was relocated to &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; locations and reintroduced as the Toyota Curren. The EXiV was available with three different engines, all multiple-point fuel injected 16-valve twin cam inline-fours: the 1838 cc &quot;4S-FE&quot; and the 1998 cc &quot;3S-FE&quot; or &quot;3S-GE&quot;. Power outputs are , , and respectively. The 3S-GE benefitted from a higher state of tuning, a forged crankshaft, and a variable-length intake manifold system (called ACIS by Toyota). The 3S-engined cars carry the ST202 chassis code, while the 1.8-litre, 4S-engined ones are called ST200.

=== Caldina (1992) ===

The first Toyota Caldina was the five-door wagon or commercial van version of the four-door sedan Toyota Corona in Japan. The wagon has independent strut rear suspension while the commercial wagon has semi-independent leaf springs. The wagon/van was given its own identity, whereas previous station wagon versions were named Corona. The Caldina was introduced as a successor to the Corona and Carina wagons, and was sold at Toyota Japanese dealerships &quot;Toyota Store&quot; and &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations. The Caldina was introduced after the Subaru Legacy wagon and the Nissan Avenir wagon.

For the European market, the Caldina was sold as the Carina E wagon. In New Zealand, it was sold as the Corona wagon.

== Tenth generation ==
=== Corona Premio (T210; 1996) ===
A final, tenth generation was built between January 1996 and December 2001 for the Japanese market, with one particular model called the Toyota Corona Premio that was spun off into an independent model called the Premio (coded ST210), with the Allion following after the Carina after 2001. The Corona Premio was offered as Base Premio, Premio E, and Premio G. Four-cylinder engine choices are 1.6-litre &quot;4A-FE&quot;, 1.8-litre lean burn &quot;7A-FE&quot;, and 2.0-litre &quot;3S-FE&quot;. Diesel engines offered were 2.0-litre &quot;2C-T&quot; and later on replaced by more economical 2.2-litre &quot;3C-T&quot;. This is the last model using Corona name in Japan. The automatic model of the Corona Premio came with three selectable driving modes for its electronically controlled transmission: Normal, ECT PWR (power mode), and ECT MANU (manual mode).

=== Caldina (1997) ===

Sharing a platform with the T210 series Toyota Corona and Toyota Carina, the Caldina is the Japanese version of the Toyota Avensis, which replaced the Carina E in Europe.

The 4WD models are coded ST215, and are offered as Active Sports GT with the 3S-GE engine. The top-of-the-line GT-T came with the turbocharged 4th generation 3S-GTE engine, and included an all-wheel-drive system similar to the Toyota Celica GT-Four. The GT-T also came with optional electronic stability control (VSC) (standard on Active Sports versions). The Aerial version features a large sunroof and contoured roof racks as standard. Weighing , the Caldina GT-T offers similar performance to a Subaru WRX wagon achieving 0–100 km/h in 7 seconds. A refresh was given in 2000 with new bumpers and lamps a refreshed interior and extra lug added to the turbo manifold to stop the warping issue common on earlier GT-T models.

Engines for lesser models are the 1.8 L 7A-FE, the 2.0 L petrol 3S-FE, and the 2.2 L diesel 3C-TE.

=== South America (T220; 1997) ===


For the subsequent model series, the T220, the Corona name was dropped in Japan and most other markets. It was built as sedan, liftback and wagon. Only the wagon was sold in Japan as the Caldina, built on the T210 platform. The sedan and liftback were mainly sold in Europe as Avensis, while the lower grade model specifically for taxi use was called Corona. Four-cylinder engines for the Avensis are 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 petrol, and diesel/turbodiesel. The Corona Taxi was only available with the diesel engines. In South America, the Avensis was sold as the Corona Avensis, powered by 2.0-litre 3S-FE engine. This was the last Corona although the T-series platform was continued with the new T240, used for the third generation Caldina and the new Allion and Premio models.

<text>Swanscombe is a village in the Borough of Dartford in Kent, England, and the civil parish of Swanscombe and Greenhithe. It is 4.4 miles west of Gravesend and 4.8 miles east of Dartford.

==History==

===Prehistory===


Bone fragments and tools, representing the earliest humans known to have lived in England, have been found from 1935 onwards at the Barnfield Pit about outside the village. This site is now the Swanscombe Heritage Park. Swanscombe Man (now thought to be female) was a late or an early archaic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. According to the Natural History Museum, however, the remains are those of a 400,000-year-old early Neanderthal woman.

The c. 400,000-year-old skull fragments are kept at the Natural History Museum in London with a replica on display at the Dartford Museum. Lower levels of the Barnfield Pit yielded evidence of an even earlier, more primitive, human, dubbed Clactonian Man.

Nearby digs on land for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link revealed a c. 400,000-year-old site with human tools and the remains of a straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;), and evidence of water vole, pine vole, newts, frogs etc., indicating a site with standing water similar to a swamp. The elephant is thought to have been butchered by humans at the site.

===Viking era===

During archaeological work undertaken at Ebbsfleet, before construction of High Speed 1, an Anglo-Saxon mill and a Roman villa were found near Swanscombe.

From Crayford to the Isle of Thanet the Danes occupied the land and terrorised the Saxon inhabitants, giving rise to the appearance of Deneholes, of which many have survived to this day. These were wells, cut deep into the chalk landscape, thought to be for concealing people and goods. They have a simple vertical shaft with short tunnels bearing horizontally from the base.

The Vikings settled throughout the winter along the Thames estuary with their ships and established camps in Kent and Essex. In surveying the distribution of the many deneholes along the Thames corridor it would appear that Essex, on the northern shore of the Thames, sustained a greater influx of Vikings than did Kent, there being considerably more recorded deneholes in Essex, particularly around Orsett and Grays – see Hangman&#x27;s Wood.

Archaeological digs and centuries of tilling have revealed a Danish castle and settlement, with pottery, anchors, weapons and some ships&#x27; timbers. The settlement was later variously called &quot;Suinescamp&quot; (in the Domesday Book of 1086), &quot;Sweinscamp&quot; and &quot;Swanscamp&quot;. Legend derives the name from the Viking king Sweyn Forkbeard, who landed in East Anglia and became King of England in 1013. The father of Canute, Sweyn died at Gainsborough, on the Trent, in 1014. Canute (Cnut) died in Shaftesbury in 1035, and his sons were unable to hold on to his empire. But the name of Swanscombe cannot derive from Sweyn Forkbeard, as the place-name is first attested in 695 AD.

Other research suggests that deneholes might have been dug as a method of extracting chalk for use on the fields above, or the mining may have been a by-product of defence. In any case the practice reached a peak around the 13th – 14th centuries, long after the Viking raids had ceased.

===Norman Conquest===
It is claimed, apparently without evidence, that in 1066 Swanscombe locals massed an army in defiance of William I and so won the right to continue their ancient privileges, including the tradition of passing inheritance by gavelkind. The men of Kent met William near Swanscombe, where the Saxons concealed their number with branches, thus intimidating the Norman army. Again according to legend, they were offered a truce that left Kent as the only region in England that William left unconquered. Hence in this area of England alone, Kent County Council adopted the motto &quot;Invicta&quot;, meaning unconquered.

===Churches===
Richard Norman Shaw designed All Saints&#x27; Church in 1894, built out of knapped flint for the workers of the cement industry. It survives as a rare example of his design, covering several Gothic Revival styles throughout its architecture and features, such as Decorated tracery on the windows and Arts and Crafts Perpendicular woodwork in the interior.

The flint parish church of St Peter and St Paul is mostly of the 13th century. However various sections contain Early Norman material. The tower and chancel contain 11th- and 12th-century work respectively, although the tower was reconstructed in the 13th century and the chancel arch is from the 14th century. The lower section of the tower contains some Saxon material. The tower is topped with a broached shingled spire, and in 1902 the church was struck by lightning causing extensive damage. A large-scale restoration was undertaken by Jabez Bignall in 1872–73 and again by him after the damage from the lightning strike. The parish register dates from 1559. George Cecil Renouard is buried in the Swanscombe churchyard.

===Second World War===
Just after 8 o&#x27;clock in the evening of Sunday 10 November 1940 a German bomb crashed down direct into The Morning Star Inn, causing in a single explosion Swanscombe&#x27;s worst wartime disaster. All that was left after the explosion was, where the pub had stood, a &quot;heap of bricks and twisted rafters&quot;¹ surrounding the smouldering pit that had been the cellar, although the staircase leading to the clubroom upstairs extended up out of the wreckage. Distressed families of those known to be in the pub at the time gathered at the street corners awaiting news of the casualties as bodies were gradually recovered from the ruins.

The official casualty lists revealed the death toll to be 27, with six others seriously injured and five people slightly hurt.

:&quot;The landlord was amongst the dead, although his wife and son survived. The barmaid who was killed had given notice the week before the raid but had stayed on that evening because of the match. One of the other victims was a merchant seaman on seven days&#x27; leave who had spent two days travelling from Scotland to see his wife and children and was having a drink with his father in the pub at the time of the bombing: both were killed.&quot;

On 30 July 1940 another Luftwaffe raid led to the death of more than a dozen civilians, with 22 seriously injured. Its proximity to London and position under the German flight path to the city meant that Swanscombe fell victim to this kind of damage several times during the war.

On 30 July 1944 a V1 rocket landed on Taunton Road. Half of one side of the road was wiped out. 13 were killed and 22 seriously injured.

===Cliff Collapse===
On 10 April 2023, Galley Hill, Swanscombe, was closed because part of the chalk cliff supporting the A226 collapsed on Easter Monday, taking some of the road with it, near the old George &amp; Dragon pub. Buses have been on diversion to Stanhope Road, the A2, Ebbsfleet International and Thames Way.

==Governance==
Swanscombe was originally part of Axstane Hundred and in 1836 also became part of Dartford Poor Law Union. When Dartford Rural District was created in 1894 Swanscombe parish became a member, as did most of the parishes of Axstane, but in 1926 it separated to form its own urban district. However under Local Government Act 1972 Swanscombe was joined to Dartford District in 1974. Although it lost its Urban District Council the area continued as a Civil Parish, now under the aegis of Dartford Borough Council, and in 1981 Swanscombe Parish Council was upgraded to Swanscombe and Greenhithe Town Council, thus electing its own mayor for the first time. The name recognises the importance of the settlement of Greenhithe within the parish.

==Cement industry==

The southeast of England has abundant resources of clay and chalk. The first mining activity known in the area was for flint, a rock commonly found across the North and South Downs and in the Weald. This was used for tools.

Swanscombe was important in the early history of cement. The first cement manufacturing works near Swanscombe were opened at Northfleet by James Parker, around 1792, making &quot;Roman cement&quot; from cement stone brought from the Isle of Sheppey. James Frost opened a works at Swanscombe in 1825, using chalk from Galley Hill, having patented a new cement called British Cement. The Swanscombe plant was subsequently acquired by John Bazley White &amp; Co, which became the largest component of Blue Circle Industries when it formed in 1900. It finally shut down in 1990. Between 1840 and 1930 it was the largest cement plant in Britain. By 1882 several cement manufacturers were operating across the north Kent region, but the resulting dust pollution drove the people of Swanscombe to take legal action against the local cement works. Despite various technological innovations, the problem persisted into the 1950s, with telegraph lines over an inch thick in white dust. Modern cement kilns in Kent using chimneys 170 m (550 feet) in height are now said to be the cleanest in the world. However, the neighbouring Medway towns are reported to be the most polluted inhabited area in the UK, and the cement industry contributes to acid rain in Scandinavia.

===Blue Circle===
The Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (APCM), later known as Blue Circle Industries, came to the area in 1900 and by 1920 owned four local factories located at Swanscombe, Northfleet, Greenhithe and Stone.

By 1970 the North Kent cement industry had evolved to become the largest centre for the production of cement in Europe, supporting a long tradition of research and development to perfect the processes used in the manufacture of chalk-based products. Since then the industry has declined considerably due to the potential for more economic manufacture elsewhere, and by 2007 only two operational kilns remained, both at Northfleet. all have been removed.

===Developments===
One of the large quarries created as a legacy of the cement industry, between Watling Street and the village of Stone, is the site of the Bluewater (shopping centre), one of the largest such centres in Europe.

An adjacent quarry is to be given up for housing – more than 6,000 houses will be built there. The development by Land Securities, known as &#x27;Eastern Quarry&#x27;, will consist of three primary schools, a secondary school, a health and social care centre and more than of new parkland, lakes and woodland.

==&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;==
The skeleton of an ancient species of elephant has been preserved in the sediment near what was once the edge of a quite small lake revealed by excavations in advance of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The skeleton was surrounded by flint tools suggesting it was butchered for its meat by early humans of that era. Only a few elephant skeletons have been found in Britain. The Swanscombe example was discovered in 2004 by Palaeolithic archaeologist Francis Wenban-Smith and was identified by the Natural History Museum as the straight-tusked &quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;, which became extinct more than 100,000 years ago.

==Cricket club==
There is one cricket club with its home in Swanscombe, Swanscombe and Greenhithe 1880 CC. Its home ground is at Broomfield Park. The club dates back to 1880.

<doc id="903896" wikidata="Q7777573" url="?curid=903896" title="Theatrical style">
<text>There are four basic theatrical genres either defined, implied, or derived by or from Aristotle: Tragedy, Comedy, Melodrama, and Drama. Any number of theatrical styles can be used to convey these forms.

A good working definition of &quot;Style&quot; is &quot;how&quot; something is done. Theatrical styles are influenced by their time and place, artistic and other social structures, and the individual styles of the particular artists. As theater is a mongrel art form, a production may or may not have stylistic integrity with regard to script, acting, direction, design, music, and venue.

==Styles==

There are a variety of theatrical styles used in theater/drama. These include

Naturalism: Portraying life on stage with close attention to detail, based on observation of real life. Cause and effect are central to the script&#x27;s structure, with the subjects focused on conflicts of nature vs. nurture, the natural order of things, survival, or notions of evolution. The production style is one of everyday reality.

Realism: Portraying characters on stage that are close to real life, with realistic settings and staging. Realism is an effort to satisfy all the theatrical conventions necessary to the production, but to do so in a way that seems to be &quot;normal&quot; life.

Surrealism: A movement in various areas of art, including painting, sculpture, and theater. The aim of surrealist theater is to overcome and eradicate the old, tired traditions of theater that placed restrictions on the imagination.

Expressionism: Anti-realistic in seeing appearance as distorted and the truth lies within man. The outward appearance on stage can be distorted and unrealistic to portray an external truth or internal emotional conflict.

Absurdity and Surrealism: Presents a perspective that all human attempts at significance are illogical. Ultimate truth is chaos with little certainty. There is no necessity that needs to drive us.

Epic Theatre: As devised by Bertolt Brecht, epic theatre forces audience members to constantly return to rational observation, rather than emotional immersion. Sudden bursts of song, elements of absurdity, and breaches of the fourth wall are all prime examples of how this rational observation is constantly revitalized; this idea is known as Verfremdungseffekt.

Melodrama: As devised by early Greek dramatists, these styles rely on stock characters and stereotypes to portray stories in an exaggerated way, either tragic or comic. Links to commedia dell&#x27;arte.

Theater of Cruelty: As developed by Antonin Artaud, a style that encourages the shock and horror of the audience, through the excessive use of light and sound, instead of active entertainment or emotional relaxation.

Physical theater: A modernist approach to theater which centralizes a performer&#x27;s movement as the key communicator of a play&#x27;s storytelling.

Poor theatre: Developed by Jerzy Growotski, this genre believes in the stripping back of set, props, costume, light, and sound to allow the focus to be placed solely upon the actors, their characterization, and the underlying human relationships.

Immersive theater: Developed by Augusto Boal, these styles all place focus on the audience member&#x27;s individuality: their personal decisions, opinions, and emotions, and how these impacts those of the characters onstage. The audience firmly exists within the &quot;world of the play&quot;. Links to Promenade and Forum theatre.

<doc id="903897" wikidata="Q1544018" url="?curid=903897" title="Tuner (radio)">
<text>In electronics and radio, a tuner is a type of receiver subsystem that receives RF transmissions, such as AM or FM broadcasts, and converts the selected carrier frequency into a form suitable for further processing or output, such as to an amplifier or loudspeaker. A tuner is also a standalone home audio product, component, or device called an AM/FM tuner or a stereo tuner that is part of a hi-fi or stereo system, or a TV tuner for television broadcasts. The verb &quot;tuning&quot; in radio contexts means adjusting the receiver to detect the desired radio signal carrier frequency that a particular radio station uses. Tuners were a major consumer electronics product in the 20th century but in practice are often integrated into other products in the modern day, such as stereo or AV receivers or portable radios.

== Design history and overview ==

The purpose of a tuner&#x27;s design is to reduce noise and have a strong ability to amplify the wanted signal. Tuners may be monophonic or stereophonic, and generally output left and right channels of sound. Tuners generally include a tuning knob or keypad to adjust the frequency, i.e. the intended radio station, measured in megahertz (e.g. 101.1 MHz). Mistuning is the greatest source of distortion in FM reception. Some models realize manual tuning by means of mechanically operated ganged variable capacitors (gangs). Often several sections are provided on a tuning capacitor, to tune several stages of the receiver in tandem, or to allow switching between different frequency bands. A later method used a potentiometer supplying a variable voltage to varactor diodes in the local oscillator and tank circuits of front end tuner, for electronic tuning. Modern radio tuners use a superheterodyne receiver with tuning selected by adjustment of the frequency of a local oscillator. This system shifts the radio frequency of interest to a fixed frequency so that it can be tuned with fixed-frequency band-pass filter. Still later, phase locked loop methods were used, with microprocessor control.

The crystal radio receiver is the simplest kind of radio receiver or tuner, and was the basis for the first commercially successful type of radio product design. Inexpensive and reliable, it was sold in millions of units and became popular in kits used by hobbyists, and was a major factor in the popularity of radio broadcasting around 1920. The crystal radio consists of an antenna, a variable inductor and a variable capacitor connected in parallel. This creates a tank circuit which responds to one resonant frequency when combined with a detector, also known as a demodulator (diode D1 in the circuit). Stereophonic receivers include a decoder as well.
Vacuum tubes made crystal sets obsolete in the 1920s due to their effective amplification. From the 1920s until the 1960s, most tuners used a vacuum tube-based design. Manufacturing shifted to solid state electronics in the 1960s, but this didn&#x27;t always result in improved sound quality compared to the older tube tuners. The radiogram, which combined a gramophone with a radio, was a predecessor of the hi-fi tuner.

The transistor was invented in 1947 and largely replaced tubes. The MOSFET was used because it is capable of handling larger inputs than bipolar transistors. Starting in the 1960s, Japanese transistor radios, which were cheaper despite their crudeness compared to American designs, began to outcompete the American products in the portable radio market. Eventually, after switching from germanium to silicon transistors, the Japanese consumer electronics companies achieved a dominant market position. Heathkit, an American company which had supplied popular kits for electronic devices since the 1940s, went out of business in 1980. 

FM broadcasting originated in the United States and was adopted as a worldwide standard. FM broadcasting in stereo in the USA began in 1961 when authorized by the FCC. This led to greater demand for new radio stations and better technology in radios. The growth of hi-fi stereo systems and car radios in turn led to a boost in FM listening. FM surpassed AM radio in 1978. FM also doubled the number of stations, enabling specialized broadcasts for different genres of music. It also required consumers to purchase new equipment. The broadcast audio FM band ( in most countries) is around higher in frequency than the AM band and provides enough space for a bandwidth of This bandwidth is sufficient to transmit both stereo channels with almost the full hearing range. 

The Post–World War II economic expansion in the US led to the growth of hi-fi products, increasingly seen as high tech hardware, with requisite jargon, and separated into premium quality components with high-class aesthetics and marketing. The 1970s and 80s were the peak period for the hi-fi audio market. Demand increased for stereo products which fueled the growth of the industry as Japan caught up with the US. Standalone audio stereo FM tuners are still sought after for audiophile and TV/FM DX applications, especially those produced in the 1970s and early 1980s, when performance and manufacturing standards were higher. The McIntosh MR78 (1972) is known as one of the first FM tuners precise enough to tune into a weaker station broadcast on the same frequency as another stronger signal. 

As a result of circuit miniaturization, tuners began to be integrated with other products such as amplifiers and preamps, and other digital electronics, and marketed as AV or stereo receivers for home theater or hi-fi systems. The Japanese development of silicon transistor technology led to popular radio products in the 1980s such as the boombox and the Sony Walkman. Although integrated hi-fi stereo systems and AV or stereo receivers contain integrated tuners, separate components are sometimes preferred for higher quality. Separating amplification also often increases overall performance.
==Television==

A television tuner or TV tuner, also called a TV receiver, is a component or subsystem that converts analog television or digital television transmissions into audio and video signals which can be further processed to produce sound and a picture. A TV tuner must filter out unwanted signals and have a high signal-to-noise ratio. Television standards supported by TV tuners include PAL, NTSC, SECAM, ATSC, DVB-C, DVB-T, DVB-T2, ISDB, DTMB, T-DMB, and open cable. VHF/UHF TV tuners are rarely found as a separate component, but are incorporated into television sets. Cable boxes, converter boxes and other set top boxes contain tuners for digital TV services, and send their output via SCART or other connector, or using an RF modulator (typically on in Europe and in North America) to TV receivers that do not natively support the services. They provide outputs via composite, S-video, or component video. Many can be used with video monitors that do not have a TV tuner or direct video input. They are often part of a VCR or digital video recorder (DVR, PVR). 

Analog tuners can tune only analog signals. An ATSC tuner is a digital tuner that tunes digital signals only. Some digital tuners provide an analog bypass. An example frequency range is , with a tuning frequency step size of Before the use of solid-state frequency synthesizers, covering the broad range of TV signal frequencies with a single tuned circuit and sufficient precision was uneconomic. Television channel frequencies were non-contiguous, with many non-broadcast services interleaved between VHF channels 6 and 7 in North America, for example. Instead, TV tuners of the era incorporated multiple sets of tuned circuits for the main signal path and local oscillator circuit. These &quot;turret&quot; tuners mechanically switched the receiving circuits by rotating a knob to select the desired channel. Channels were presented in fixed sequence, with no means to skip channels unused in a particular area. When UHF TV broadcasting was made available, often two complete separate tuner stages were used, with separate tuning knobs for selection of VHF band and UHF band channels. To allow for a small amount of drift or misalignment of the tuner with the actual transmitted frequency, tuners of that era included a &quot;fine tuning&quot; knob to allow minor adjustment for best reception. The combination of high frequencies, multiple electrical contacts, and frequent changing of channels in the tuner made it a high maintenance part of the television receiver, as relatively small electrical or mechanical problems with the tuner would make the set unusable. 

Computers may use an internal TV tuner card or USB connected external tuner to allow reception of overt-the-air broadcasts or cable signals.

<text>H-IIA (H-2A) is an active expendable launch system operated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. These liquid fuel rockets have been used to launch satellites into geostationary orbit; lunar orbiting spacecraft; &quot;Akatsuki&quot;, which studied the planet Venus; and the Emirates Mars Mission, which was launched to Mars in July 2020. Launches occur at the Tanegashima Space Center. The H-IIA first flew in 2001. , H-IIA rockets were launched 49 times, including 43 consecutive missions without a failure, dating back to 29 November 2003.

Production and management of the H-IIA shifted from JAXA to MHI on 1 April 2007. Flight 13, which launched the lunar orbiter SELENE, was the first H-IIA launched after this privatization.

The H-IIA is a derivative of the earlier H-II rocket, substantially redesigned to improve reliability and minimize costs. There have been four variants, with two in active service (as of 2020) for various purposes. A derivative design, the H-IIB, was developed in the 2000s and made its maiden flight in 2009 before finally retired on its final launch in 2020.

== Vehicle description ==
The base configuration, and the only remaining active configuration of an H-IIA launch vehicle, uses two SRB-A type solid rocket boosters (SRBs). The launch capability of the H-IIA launch vehicle could be enhanced by adding an additional two SRB-A boosters or up to four Castor 4AXL solid strap-on boosters (SSBs). 

The models are indicated by three or four numbers following the prefix &quot;H2A&quot;:
* The first number in the sequence indicates the number of stages (always 2)
* The second number in the sequence indicates the number of liquid rocket boosters (a planned addition to the launch vehicle that was canceled, so always 0)
* The third number in the sequence indicates the number of SRB-A type solid rocket boosters (2 or 4)
* The fourth, optional, number in the sequence indicates the number of Castor 4AXL solid strap-on boosters (2 or 4)

== Variants ==
;Launch system status:


== Launch history ==
The first H-IIA was successfully launched on 29 August 2001, followed by a string of successes.

The sixth launch on 29 November 2003, intended to launch two IGS reconnaissance satellites, failed. JAXA announced that launches would resume in 2005, and the first successful flight took place on 26 February 2005 with the launch of MTSAT-1R.

The first launch for a mission beyond Earth orbit was on 14 September 2007 for the SELENE Moon mission. The first foreign payload on the H-IIA was the Australian FedSat-1 in 2002. As of March 2015, 27 out of 28 launches were successful.

A rocket with increased launch capabilities, H-IIB, is a derivative of the H-IIA family. H-IIB uses two LE-7A engines in its first stage, as opposed to one in H-IIA. The first H-IIB was successfully launched on 10 September 2009.

For the 29th flight on 24 November 2015, an H-IIA with an upgraded second stage launched the Telstar 12V satellite, the first commercial primary payload for a Japanese launch vehicle.

<text>The Nissan Pintara is a compact automobile that was manufactured by Nissan Motor Australia from 1986 to 1992.

== First generation (R31; 1986–1990) ==
The first generation R31 Nissan Pintara is a compact family car which was built by Nissan Australia at its Clayton, Victoria assembly plant in Melbourne from mid-1986. It was based on the Nissan Skyline. Powered by a single overhead camshaft fuel-injected 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine, it was intended to compete with the Mitsubishi Magna. Like the Australian-built six cylinder R31 Skyline, it was offered in sedan and station wagon form.

Four specification levels of the R31 Pintara were offered: GLi, Executive, GX, and GXE. A TRX bodykit package was offered for the GX and GXE sedans, featuring a front and rear air dam, rear spoiler, side skirts, grille cover, alloy wheels and low profile tyres. 
Unlike the later U12 TRX, this did not feature any mechanical upgrades.

The sole engine choice was a 2.0-litre &quot;CA20E&quot; inline-four, producing (DIN) at 5200 rpm and (DIN) at 3200 rpm. This unit was SOHC, multi-point fuel injected featuring electronic concentrated control system (ECCS) including electronic ignition. It featured two spark plugs per cylinder to help meet emission requirements.

This engine was previously seen in the (sportier) Nissan Gazelle and was a particularly high revving engine for a car of this type.

Rather than build the U11 Bluebird, Nissan Australia had chosen to go the route of building a localised four-cylinder Skyline, because of the Bluebird&#x27;s switch to front-wheel drive with the U11. Nissan Australia had feared that the new front-wheel drive design would not resonate well with the Australian consumer, as the Australian market was well acclimated to rear-wheel drive at the time.

For this reason, rival Toyota had continued to produce the rear-wheel drive T140 Corona up to 1987 for the Australian market, despite most other markets receiving the front-wheel-drive T150. The reality of marketing a front-wheel drive Bluebird in the Australian market would come into fruition with the succeeding U12 model.


== Second generation (U12; 1989–1992) ==
The first generation Pintara was replaced in 1989 by a model initially dubbed by the media as &quot;Project Matilda&quot;, which turned out to be a locally produced front-wheel drive version of the Nissan Bluebird (U12), rather than a model uniquely designed for Australia as initial stories had indicated. However, the model performed badly in local testing, and required body and chassis strengthening.

In Australia, this was sold as the Nissan Pintara (U12), also available as a locally designed five-door &quot;Superhatch&quot;. The sedan and Superhatch were exported to New Zealand as the Nissan Bluebird (replacing locally assembled models sourced from Japan) while the Superhatch was exported to Japan as the Bluebird Aussie.

The U12 model was discontinued in mid-1992 when Nissan Australia ended local production and New Zealand reverted to local assembly of the next generation Bluebird from Japanese kits.

Under the Button car plan, in which local manufacturers shared models, Ford Australia marketed a rebadged version of the U12 Pintara sedan and hatchback as the Ford Corsair. In addition, Ford provided the tooling and stamped the car&#x27;s body panels.

Nissan fitted a 2.0-litre &quot;CA20E&quot; inline-four engine to the GLi and Executive levels of trim. This engine was rated at (DIN) at 5200 rpm for power, and (DIN) at 4000 rpm torque.

T, Ti, and TRX versions received a 2.4-litre &quot;KA24E&quot; inline-four. This engine produced (DIN) at 5600 rpm and (DIN) at 2800 rpm. Fitted with electronic concentrated control system (ECCS) for precise MPI fuel injection, the 2.4-litre also featured ignition timing control with SOHC and three valves per cylinder (two intake, one exhaust).

<text>The Mitsubishi Magna is a mid-size car that was produced over three generations between 1985 and 2005 by Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited (MMAL). Developed as a replacement for the Mitsubishi Sigma, each Magna generation derived from Japanese platforms re-engineered for the Australian market and conditions. Initially, Magna offered inline-four engines in a mid-size sedan package—a station wagon debuted in 1987. Over the years, each new series grew in size, and with the second generation of 1991, the range was bolstered by a luxury variant called Mitsubishi Verada and a V6 engine. The Magna/Verada became the first Australian-made vehicle to be exported worldwide in large numbers, predominantly as the Mitsubishi Diamante. The third and final iteration Magna/Verada launched in 1996, adding all-wheel-drive (AWD) from 2002, and receiving a substantial styling update in 2003. They were replaced by the Mitsubishi 380 in 2005.

MMAL manufactured the Magna/Verada at its Clovelly Park, South Australia plant. The majority of its engines—most notably, the original four-cylinder &quot;Astron II&quot; (codenamed 4G54) and subsequent &quot;Cyclone&quot; V6 engines (codenamed 6G72 and 6G74)—were manufactured at the Lonsdale, South Australia plant.

== First generation (1985) ==

Following a claimed million development cost, Mitsubishi introduced the Magna to Australia in April 1985, initially as a sedan only model, but with a station wagon added in June 1987. It was manufactured at Tonsley Park, South Australia. MMAL designated this first, 1985 Magna as the TM series, with the 1987 and 1989 updates known as the TN and TP series respectively.

Mitsubishi developed the Magna as a replacement for the rear-wheel drive (RWD) Sigma. Previously, Mitsubishi had a larger family car in the form of the mainly six-cylinder Chrysler Valiant, inherited upon MMAL&#x27;s takeover of Chrysler Australia&#x27;s operations in 1980. Nevertheless, the Valiant was put out of production the following year, making the medium-sized Sigma MMAL&#x27;s largest offering. When a replacement became due, MMAL opined that a car&#x27;s width was a crucial factor to Australian buyers who have traditionally favoured large cars. As a result, to compete more effectively against the large RWD rivals, viz. the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, former Chrysler engineers now working for MMAL, developed a wider mid-sized car specific to the Australian market. This model derived from the fifth-generation Japanese Mitsubishi Galant Σ (Sigma), a front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicle released in August 1983. Engineers accomplished this by splicing an extra of width through the Galant&#x27;s body and by strengthening it for Australian road conditions. Mitsubishi Motors codenamed these cars as &quot;YF&quot; and &quot;YFW&quot;—&quot;W&quot; for &quot;wide&quot;. To emphasise the size advantage of the Mitsubishi over other medium cars, it was named Magna—deriving from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;big&quot;.

The only major aesthetic difference of the Magna relative to its Japanese donor was the wider body, as the general styling and side profile were similar also thanks to shared tooling for doors, guards and pillars. While still smaller and lighter than its then current RWD rivals, the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, the Magna trumped the latter for interior space due to the inherently superior packaging offered by the FWD layout. As the enlarging added minimal weight and the overall footprint remained smaller compared to rivals, the Magna could make do with a big-bore four-cylinder engine instead of the more traditional six-cylinder engines used by Holden and Ford. Even despite a , fuel efficiency was not significantly better. In particular, average fuel consumption was officially rated at in city driving and in highway driving.

The widening approach proved successful for the Australian market, making the Magna a strong competitor against all original competitors envisaged by MMAL, being the Toyota Corona, Holden Camira, Nissan Bluebird, Ford Telstar, plus the larger Holden Commodore. The platform widening also helped influence Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Toyota to do the same for their mid-size models in international markets, such as in the case of the &quot;wide-bodied&quot; Toyota Camry (XV10) of 1991.

The engine of the Magna was the Australian-made 2.6-litre transversely-mounted inline-four cylinder engine. Codenamed 4G54 and marketed as &quot;Astron II&quot;, it was a development of the &quot;Astron&quot; engine (codenamed 4G52) fitted to Sigma. It initially produced at 5000 rpm and at 3000 rpm. &quot;Astron II&quot; was an eight-valve single overhead cam (SOHC) design with advanced features for the time, such as hydraulic mounts and &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; counterbalancing technology, designed and licensed to other automakers by Mitsubishi Motors to reduce the vibrations inherent in large four-cylinder engines. In the TM series, these engines were carbureted, with Mitsubishi&#x27;s &quot;ECI Multi&quot; electronic fuel injection (EFI) version launched with the TN series, boosting power to .

Magna was fitted with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed &quot;ELC&quot; automatic transmission with electronic control and overdrive (a button on the shift lever providing the ability to switch between the default three-speed mode or overdrive four-speed). The Executive and luxury Elite models, however, were available only in automatic. In terms of suspension, Magna&#x27;s front comprised MacPherson struts front design and, at the rear, a three-link torsion beam axle with coil springs (specifically, a torsion beam axle, located by two trailing arms and a Panhard rod). The wagons ran a four-link beam axle with coil springs.

Between 1985 and 1990, MMAL sold almost 209,000 Magnas.

=== TM ===
At launch in April 1985, the TM series included the following models: the base GLX, the mid-range SE and the high-end Elite. August 1986 saw the range expanded with a better-than-GLX equipped model known as the &quot;Executive&quot;. Aimed at fleet buyers, this new variant added full plastic wheel coverings, standard power steering and manual or automatic transmission with air conditioning as the sole option. The luxury-oriented models—SE and Elite—featured higher equipment: seats were covered in velour trim with the driver&#x27;s seat being seven-way adjustable (instead of four-way); lumbar support for driver and passenger; rear integrated headrests and folding centre armrest with boot access; map lights and remote boot release; power windows, central locking and alloy wheels (standard on Elite and optional on SE); metallic paint standard (two-tone standard on Elite and single-tone optional on Elite and SE); radio/cassette players (featuring a novel security system that would make the unit completely inoperable in the event that its power was disconnected) with the Elite also adding a rear quarter panel electric antenna, separate equaliser and steering wheel controls. In addition, instead of standard control steering stalks and ventilation panel on the centre console, both the SE and Elite had two steering side pods, thus bringing all major controls within a driver&#x27;s fingertips and making them jointly height adjustable with the steering column. Elite also featured an LCD instrument panel, in line with the Japanese automotive trend in the late 1980s. Common to all models were a tilt adjustable steering and cable-operated fuel filler door release. Non-Elite models also had a roof mounted manual antenna above the right A-pillar and the following optional equipment: air conditioning (GLX, Executive and SE), power steering and automatic transmission (GLX and SE).

Sale prices were a key critical factor in Magna&#x27;s market competitiveness, since for less money, MMAL was able to sell a more refined and economical package relative to its main rivals. This was especially reflected in the merits highlighted under the &quot;value for money&quot; category of the &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year title won by Magna in 1985.

The TM series was marred by various quality-control problems (chiefly, fragile engine heads and automatic transmissions), which were gradually rectified throughout the life of the first generation.

=== TN ===
April 1987 brought the first update to Magna, designated TN. Cosmetic changes included a new grille insert, the relocation of the rear license plate to the bumper and revised trim. Better seats, an optional EFI engine upgrade, revised automatic transmission, improved audio and more equipment marked the changes which kept sales strong.

From June 1987, a station wagon body variant engineered and exclusively built in Australia, broadened Magna&#x27;s appeal further, particularly with fleets thanks to a load capacity. In June 1988, a sporty Elante model (with EFI, sportier suspension tuning and bodykit) and an Elite wagon also arrived.

=== TP ===
In June 1989, a final update and facelift of the first generation Magna was launched, known as the TP series. Trimmings were again updated with a further revised grille insert and rear lights fascia (now featuring a grey row) as well as new wheels designs and paint colours. An improved four-speed automatic transmission, interior console and seats were also part of the update. Power steering became standard across the range during 1990, as did EFI except for the base GLX. Manual transmission was now available on the Executive. In September 1990, a Grand Tourer model of 1,000 sedans came to the market with bigger wheels, the Elante&#x27;s tauter suspension set-up and EFI. Grand Tourers were offered in white (500 units), 250 in burgundy, 250 in &quot;Riviera Blue&quot;, and also featured a full bodykit, gold striping and gold alloy wheels.

The TP sedan remained in production until April 1991 whereas the station wagon continued to be sold alongside the new TR series Magna sedan until May 1992. Several limited editions were introduced to support sales. These included the GLX-based Encore sedan and wagon of May 1991 with air-conditioning as standard. Then in September 1991, 500 more Grand Tourers were released—this time as station wagons featuring silver striping and silver alloy wheels from the Elante. The Grand Tourer wagons all had EFI engines. The final run of production consisted of 500 units of the Executive Safari wagon in November 1991, all with EFI and automatic transmission.

== Second generation (1991) ==

=== TR / KR ===
Magna was re engineered from the ground-up with the introduction of a larger sedan in April 1991, and station wagon in May 1992. This series was designated TR and carried over its powertrain from the previous generation. Unlike the first generation whose wide-body was designed and engineered in Australia, this second generation inherited the already wide-body Japanese Mitsubishi Sigma platform on which it was based, were created by splicing an extra down the middle of the platform of the sixth-generation Mitsubishi Galant, released in 1987. MMAL estimated that, between 1989 (when the project started) and the wagon&#x27;s arrival in 1992, the total investment in the new Magna totalled some .

Though more aerodynamic with a , the TR series was also some heavier than the first. The venerable &quot;Astron II&quot; engine was upgraded to, and only available with, EFI. As a result, the engine outputs now increased to at 4750 rpm and at 3750 rpm on ULP 91 RON petrol, and at 4750 rpm and at 4000 rpm on PULP 95 RON fuel. Later in 1991, Mitsubishi reintroduced a GLX base model, which was only carbureted and was priced lower than the other models to make the new Magna more appealing to fleet buyers.

In July 1991, MMAL introduced an upmarket derivative called the Mitsubishi Verada with a 3.0-litre V6 engine and codenamed KR series. Both Magna and Verada shared the same body, although the latter featured a unique grille and larger bumpers from the US export models as well as luxury fittings.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mitsubishi TR/TS Magna (1991–96)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian-made 3.0-litre V6 was codenamed 6G72 and marketed as &quot;Cyclone&quot;. Its outputs ranged from at 5500 rpm and at 4000 rpm on ULP 91, to at 5500 rpm and at 3000 rpm on PULP. The automatic transmissions used by both four- and six-cylinder models was marketed &quot;INVECS&quot;.

While Australia continued to endure the early 1990s recession, MMAL&#x27;s ambitions to compete more directly with Ford and Holden with a six-cylinder Magna remained on hold. Finally, in 1993, with the economy recovering and oil prices stabilised after the Gulf War, the Verada&#x27;s V6 engine was offered on Magna for the first time—albeit as an option. This 3.0-litre V6 was only available on the Executive, which was also equipped with larger 15-inch wheels and different interior trim. A small &quot;V6&quot; badge on the boot lid distinguished the six- from the four-cylinder model.

At launch, the TR series comprised the Magna Executive sedan, SE sedan, and the automatic sedan-only Elite. Of the V6-engined Verada range, the Ei version was equipped to about the same level as a Magna SE, with the exception that air-conditioning was standard. The top of the range Verada Xi also included alloy wheels, keyless door entry, climate control, cruise control, an upmarket sound system, steering wheel controls for cruise and sound system, power windows, electrically adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, power antenna, and security system. Furthermore, the Xi featured an electronically controlled suspension with four-way adjustable shock absorbers (dampers) and adjustable pneumatic springs in addition to the standard coil springs. This system automatically adjusts spring and damper rates commensurate with road conditions, speed and driving style. An anti-lock braking system (ABS) and driver&#x27;s airbag became available for the first time on both Veradas.

The New Zealand export cars were badged Magna and V3000, depending on their respective fitment of four- and six-cylinder engines. The four-cylinder Magna model range comprised a GLX and Super Saloon, whereas the V3000 comprised an Executive, Super Saloon (renamed Elite for wagons) and SEi.

The new Australian-made Mitsubishi was designed to be exported internationally and its build quality reflected this engineering intent, with planned initial station wagon volumes of 10,000 units per year to Japan, the US, UK and New Zealand for an eventual total of 40,000 units per year. The Verada station wagon formed the basis of MMAL&#x27;s large export programme under the Diamante and Sigma names, with Australia the only source of these wagons worldwide.

=== TS / KS ===
All models were facelifted in March 1994, with the arrival of the new TS and KS series. Their respective engines were further upgraded and, apart from revised wheel trims, the revised Magna sedans were also identifiable by a new colour-keyed boot garnish around the licence plate, instead of the previous grey. The revised Verada received additional equipment previously reserved for export markets. These included a more distinctive front grille, more expensive multi-parabola headlights relative to single units (the first Australian-built car to adopt these and a distinguishing figure for future luxury and sports Magna-derivatives) and greater cabin equipment to maintain a more premium status than the increasingly popular Magna V6. In December 1995, the export version of the V6 wagon was sold locally as the Verada Touring wagon, in a limited edition of only 81 manuals and 99 automatics.

The successful introduction of the Verada as the luxury flagship and upmarket shift of the Magna SE, resulted in the demise of the Magna Elite. The TS and KS series were replaced by the all-new third generation TE and KE series in 1996, however, the wagons remained for sale up to 1997 pending the delayed arrival of a new generation wagon.

== Third generation (1996) ==

=== TE / KE ===
In April and July 1996, MMAL respectively released a new generation Magna and Verada, which were broadly based on the pillar-less Japanese second generation Diamante.

The cost of the Australian project was some and both cars won the 1996 Wheels Car of the Year award, with judges praising the car&#x27;s value for money.

As was the case with the second generation, the TE and KE series shared the same platform, which was codenamed &quot;YR&quot;. Their bodies were bigger ( higher and longer than the TS series but close to the KS series) and stiffer (13 percent more) yet only marginally heavier (by less than ) than before thanks to its greater aluminium construction. The new Magna and Verada also had coupe-like frameless windows plus slim centre/B-pillars, with increased front and rear legroom and boot space. The Verada was again distinguished by more luxurious fittings and longer front and rear bumper bars to meet US safety standards. Inside, unlike the Verada, Magna&#x27;s cabin was dominated by dark grey trim that, along with the high waistline, caused some criticisms about a claustrophobic &quot;bunker&quot; effect.

The Magna&#x27;s powerplants included, for the first time, a Japanese-imported 2.4-litre four-cylinder (codenamed 4G64-S4) with 90 percent new parts relative to the related engine fitted on the previous Magna. There were also new Australian-made V6 engines with a 3.0-litre capacity (codenamed 6G72) for the Magna and a 3.5-litre displacement for the Verada (codenamed 6G74). The V6 returned official city and highway fuel consumption figures of and , respectively.

The initial models included the Executive and the Altera (previously, the SE), both available with a choice of either engine and four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmissions. From October 1996, fully equipped Advance and Altera LS models (the latter, the equivalent of the previous Elite model) were added. The 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine produced and , while the 3.0-litre V6 produced and , claiming a markedly quicker sprint and improved acceleration times. The four-speed electronic &quot;INVECS II&quot; automatic transmission was new and could adapt to the driver&#x27;s pattern of use and road conditions to select the optimum gear for any situation, thanks to &quot;fuzzy-logic&quot;. Although the power-assisted rack and pinion mechanism had the same mounting points as the Diamante, the components were manufactured to MMAL&#x27;s specifications in Australia, by TWR. Suspensions were independent (MacPherson struts) at the front, instead of the multi-link designs of the Diamante, which nevertheless donated its rear multi-link to the Australia sedan (while the wagon adopted a different and more compact design altogether). Brakes included discs all around (front ventilated) with the option of a Bosch 5.3 ABS. The braking system also included Australia&#x27;s first &quot;Banksia&quot; parking brake (developed by PBR), some 10 to 20 percent lighter and cheaper than conventional systems at the time.

The Verada was available as an Ei or Xi model, only available with the 3.5-litre V6 (which produced and ) mated to an automatic transmission. Its highest specification again formed the basis of MMAL&#x27;s export programme, becoming the sole Diamante for all world markets except Japan, where a Japanese-built Diamante remained available. Mitsubishi planned to export 25,000 units per year to 18 countries. In its biggest market—the United States—the Diamante was positioned to compete in the &quot;near luxury&quot; segment. In New Zealand, the V3000 badge was retired and the new Diamante sold there consisted of rebadged Australian models of both the Magna and Verada, instead of Diamantes with exclusive specifications for all other world export markets.

The Executive was the entry-level model that featured: power steering, four-speaker sound system, power mirrors, remote boot and fuel filler release, central locking and an engine immobiliser. The Altera model, which was a mid-entry-level model, added: air-conditioning, power windows and cruise control. Options included: airbags for driver and passenger, ABS, a CD player and alloy wheels. Subsequent additions to the model range included the Advance (safety-package) and the Altera LS (mid-luxury package), which featured ABS, airbags, CD player and alloy wheels as standard.

The TE series was launched with an initial palette of eight colours. Four were carried over from the previous TS Magna (i.e. &quot;Paris White&quot;, &quot;Calypso Red&quot;, &quot;Arctic Blue&quot;, and &quot;Maderia&quot; (maroon)) and another four were newly introduced (i.e. &quot;Silverleaf&quot; (silver), &quot;Kashmir&quot; (light beige), &quot;Greenstone&quot; and &quot;Embassy&quot; (charcoal grey)). A short-lived &quot;Olive Green&quot; colour was made available late production in the TE/KE production and &quot;Atlantis Blue&quot; (dark sapphire blue pearl) was unique to the Verada.

The TE and KE series were the most aerodynamic car produced ever in Australia even compared to the VF Commodore or FG X Falcon, with an amazing . This achievement was due to a sweeping roofline (which, however, compromised rear headroom) and such things as &quot;flag&quot; external rear-view mirrors, fixed to independent door posts instead of being more traditionally mounted directly on the front door A-pillar triangle.

A wagon version was launched in March 1997, with a , but was quickly replaced by the TF series equivalent three months later.

=== TF / KF ===
The TF/KF series was introduced in June 1997. Magna&#x27;s range consisted of five models: Executive, Advance, Altera, Altera LS and Sports. The 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine was seen only in the Executive. These cars offered redesigned wheel covers, speed-limit alert and upgraded interior trims, which included cup holders. The Executive and Advance were identical in appearance but the Advance had a different interior trim and was fitted as standard with airbags and ABS. The full colour-coded Altera and Altera LS introduced power windows and several other options such as dual front airbags. Manual transmissions became only available on Executive, Advance, Solara and Sports. From June to August 1998, a limited edition Solara was introduced and it included all Advance features as standard, plus: alloy wheels, colour-coding, &quot;Solara&quot; badging on the rear doors and at the bottom right-hand side of the boot.

The Magna Sports was available in only four colours: &quot;Paris White&quot;, &quot;Calypso Red&quot;, &quot;Nautilus Blue&quot; (deep blue), and &quot;Frontier Green&quot; (deep green), the latter two colours being new to the TF series. This new model carried all the standard features of the Executive model on which it was based, plus a deck lid spoiler, red side strip, 16-inch alloy wheels (same as the Verada Ei, but polished), and unique interior trims such as a metal-style instrument cluster fascia. Its V6 was standard as on all Magnas, however, only the Sports could be optioned with a manumatic &quot;Tiptronic&quot; four-speed automatic transmission featuring for the first time on an Australian-built car, a manual shifting function (via a second transmission gate plane to the right of standard gear positions, with &quot;push-forward&quot; upshifts and &quot;push-back&quot; downshifts). The Sports had improved handling characteristics thanks to the addition of an 18 mm rear swaybar (a rear bar swaybar was not fitted to the standard Magna), 11 percent firmer rear springs, firmer upper control arm and trailing arm bushes, and suspension height lowered by 10 mm. Options included dual airbags and ABS. This specific model represented MMAL&#x27;s foray into the Australian sporty family passenger car sector, as well as an initial and long overdue departure from the more conservative Japanese product planning. The Sports&#x27; production ceased after September 1998.

The 3.5-litre engine that powered the KF series Verada was identical to that fitted to the KE series. Its main changes, like the TF series Magna, included new wheel designs and cabin trim, revised colours and a specification adjustment – such as an over-speed warning device, cupholders and standard dual front airbags.

Several new colours (&quot;Cocoon White&quot; (pearl white), &quot;Astral Blue&quot; (metallic blue), &quot;Lugano Green&quot; (pearl blue/green) and &quot;Burra&quot; (pearl dark red/bronze)) were introduced during the later production of the TF series and the final unit built came out in December 1998.

About 60,000 TF Magna&#x27;s were built and over 5,000 KF Verada&#x27;s for Australian roads.
=== TH / KH ===

The TH series was launched in March 1999 with the earliest examples built in December 1998. The cost of this upgrade (including Verada models) reached , which went towards increased availability of the 3.5-litre V6 engine and a matching manual transmission as well as specification and trim changes across the range.

On the engine front, in fact, due to slow sales and growing consumer preference for more powerful engines, Magna&#x27;s imported four-cylinder was dropped. At this time, the 3.0-litre V6 became standard and Verada&#x27;s 3.5-litre engine also became a Magna option. The 3.0-litre V6 was fitted only to the Executive, while all other models could be powered by the previous Verada&#x27;s 3.5-litre V6 (optional on Executive).

Cosmetic changes included revisions to the basic design of the car, such as a more aggressive front grille, redesigned rear, revised interiors, redesigned wheel covers and alloy wheels. Air conditioning was made standard across the range. A number of colour changes also occurred: &quot;Calypso Red&quot; was replaced with &quot;Sienna Red&quot;, while &quot;Sable Black&quot; pearl (pearl black with green flakes) took the place of Embassy grey. &quot;Riversand&quot;, a new strong beige metallic colour, was also introduced in April 1999 as were &quot;Mawson White&quot;, a brighter more pure white (pictured right) and &quot;Pewter&quot; (metallic silver), which replaced &quot;Silverleaf&quot;. &quot;Island Blue&quot; and &quot;Glacier Green&quot; (aqua blue/green) were two other new colours used on the TH but are rare.

The TH and KH series claimed the honours of being the first Australian-made car with a four-channel ABS featuring an Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) system—a Bosch 5.3 module. Another new key feature was an 8-function trip computer and integrated anti-theft alarm system. The model range included: Executive (manual and auto); Advance (manual and auto); Altera LS (auto) and Sports (manual and &quot;Sports Mode&quot; automatic).

MMAL also became the first Australian manufacturer to offer a traction control system labelled &quot;TCL&quot; (meaning, Trace Control Logic), which was switchable and initially available only on Magna Sports. A limited edition Solara was reintroduced later in 1999 as well as the V6 Si in April 2000. Altera LS was discontinued at the end of 1999, due to its closeness to the Verada Ei. The 1999 models lacked V6 badges but the 2000 models often featured these on the back lower right end of the boot lid. The last TH series production between May and June 2000, were 1000 Executive LS units (automatic only), which were similar to the discontinued Altera LS but without power windows, dual airbags and less colour-coding (e.g. unpainted black mirrors).

A Magna Sports participated in the Australian GT Production Car Championship, with varying successes, driven by MMAL engineer and privateer, Robert Chadwick. The vehicle featured front limited slip differential (LSD) later brought to production on the TJ series Magna Ralliart.

=== TJ / KJ ===
With the launch of the TJ series in July 2000, Magna offered revised styling. The car&#x27;s overall shape remained the same as the previous TE to TH series, except for a raised central section for the bonnet ending with a beak splitting the front grille, making some journalists coin the phrase &quot;bird of prey&quot;. Magna Sports and the new VR-X model featured the same one-unit turn-light/double parabolic headlights as Verada. At the back, the boot-lid featured a recessed centre section and new tail light lenses with new-trend circular lit chambers. The cost of this upgrade was some .

A new new-chromed Mitsubishi badge was also introduced, replacing the more traditional red triple diamonds. MMAL&#x27;s proposal to use a black Mitsubishi badge to distinguish the Magna sports range was rejected by Japan&#x27;s conservative management. Another external change in the TJ series was the replacement of the chrome-look window surround with a more modern black fitting (Verada sedans maintained the more luxurious chrome).

Several new colours were introduced including a very bright &quot;Island Blue&quot; (aqua) and &quot;Glacier Green&quot; (green aqua, both used on some previous TH series in 1999), which were discontinued after only a few months of production. In May 2001, a new darker &quot;Pacific Blue&quot; colour was introduced to replace the just mentioned two colours and &quot;Flame Red&quot; was also reintroduced to the range, mostly as the hero colour for the subsequent Ralliart model. &quot;Sapphire Blue&quot; and &quot;Daintree Green&quot; were added too and proved popular. Grey and beige interior options were made available to any exterior colour in the Executive/Advance, with grey otherwise the default, becoming the only option on the Series 2 given its greater sales popularity. Equipment levels increased in the TJ series with a driver&#x27;s airbag and CD player now standard across the range.

The TJ series carried over the previous 3.0-litre V6 (6G72) for the Executive models, which could now be upgraded with the optional 3.5-litre V6 (6G74), otherwise fitted to all other models as standard. This resulted in Executive models with a 3.0-litre engines being extremely rare and, ultimately, dropped altogether in subsequent series.

Unlike 6G74-based engine available in Japan, the Australian-built V6 still had 24 valves but used a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) design instead of a more complex and costly double overhead cams (DOHC) design.

Sports and VR-X featured a larger 2.5-inch free flowing sports exhaust system, minor changes to the timing and duration of valve opening (both inlet and exhaust), which boosted power up to , resulting in a moderately sporty exhaust tone and class-leading performance amongst Australian-made sport sedans. Their engine was marketed as a &quot;high output&quot; unit to distinguish it from the mainstream version fitted on all other Magnas and Veradas.

At launch, the model range of the TJ and KJ series comprised: the Magna Executive, Magna Advance sedan and wagon, Magna Sports sedan, Magna VR-X sedan, Verada Ei sedan and wagon, and Verada Xi sedan.

The Magna Sports featured full exterior colour coding, six-spoke 16x6-inch alloy wheels, improved suspension and swaybars and a deck lid spoiler shared with the Magna VR-X. The mechanically similar VR-X shared these features, but also had aggressively styled front and rear bumper spoiler extensions, wheel arch extensions, side skirts and large diameter round chrome exhaust tip. Inside, the Sports and VR-X also shared white instrument cluster dials, sports fabric seat trim and front seat backrests embroidered with the respective models&#x27; name. The automatic VR-X also had a chrome gear gate inherited from the Verada. The subsequent and rare Magna Sports wagon (produced only with the TJ series) was fitted with a full bodykit featuring silver accents, unlike the Sports sedan that featured only had a deck lid spoiler.

Automatic Sports and VR-X (as well as Verada) models were now fitted with a five-speed &quot;Tiptronic&quot; transmission with &quot;TCL&quot; traction control system, making Mitsubishi the first Australian manufacturer to go beyond the then common four-speeds. Meanwhile, manual transmissions were dropped from the wagons, which gained standard automatic transmissions.

In October 2000, MMAL offered a limited-run Magna Solara, which was based on the Advance. Inside it featured a four-disc in-dash CD player, while externally it was distinguished by 15-inch &quot;Manta&quot; alloy wheels as standard, two-tone paint finish and body-coloured exterior mirrors, front grille and door side mouldings.

The TJ series was the subject of a number of rolling updates, beginning in May 2001 spearheaded by an upgraded VR-X range, followed by that of September 2001 affecting all models including the Verada range (officially known as the MY02 series) and culminating with the TJ and KJ Series 2 in July 2002. In 2002 and 2003, the TJ series was also bolstered by the Magna Ralliart and by the Magna and Verada AWD range, respectively. With the KJ Series 2 update, MMAL launched the limited-run Verada GTV, which used drivetrain components of the Magna Sports and VR-X. This subsequently became a permanent model rebadged as the Verada GTVi from March 2003.

Total production of the TJ and KJ series as at the end of 2001, reached 43,492 units with 19,215 exported to the US, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and the Middle East (where Magna also ended up served as an Iraqi police patrol cars). The most notable award won by this series was the Diamante&#x27;s title of New Zealand&#x27;s Car of the Year for &quot;Best Large Car&quot;.

In 2001, a Magna TJ Sports won Class D of the GT Production Showroom Showdown Race at Bathurst and a V8-powered RWD Magna contested the V8 Future Touring class of the 2000–01 Australian Super Touring Championship. The Magna VR-X was voted the best-value performance car on the Australian market by a News Limited panel of motoring journalists.

;May 2001 update
From May 2001, coinciding with the launch of the Magna VR-X Limited Edition, MMAL distanced all VR-X models from the Sports by equipping the former with unique five-spoke 17x7-inch alloy wheels shod with 225/50 Bridgestone performance tyres. Furthermore, the suspension was modified with higher rate springs, revised shock absorbers and a new front sway bar. Cosmetically, both the Magna Sports and VR-X were fitted with black brake callipers, black interior door handles, black inserts in the exterior door handles, and revised headlight units now featuring clear turn bezels (as opposed to the original amber).

;Magna VR-X Limited Edition
With build and wholesale between May and June 2001, this vehicle was marketed as the &quot;VRX-tra&quot;. It featured the above exterior upgrades plus interior upgrades that were part of a &quot;Leather Pack&quot; offered in two parts. The optional &quot;Pack 1&quot; included:
* Unique black fabric/Howe leather trim with &quot;VR-X&quot; embroidered front seats in either blue or red with matching door panels, depending on exterior paint (i.e. blue with &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;, &quot;Sapphire Blue&quot; and &quot;Mawson White&quot; paint; red with &quot;Sienna Red&quot;, &quot;Pewter&quot; and &quot;Sable&quot; (black))
* Colour-coordinated instrument cluster (blue or red with &quot;VR-X&quot; inscribed rev counter)
* Two-tone black leather wrapped steering wheel with perforated silver inserts (which later became an optional accessory for all models)
* Silver panels for the centre console
* Verada-sourced fittings such as upgraded eight-speaker sound system with power antenna and in-dash four-CD stacker plus upgraded trip computer with dual readout.

The optional &quot;Pack 2&quot; consisted of all &quot;Pack 1&quot; features plus the Verada&#x27;s electric sunroof with front map and C-pillar lamps. In all, MMAL built 175 of these models, of which 54 were fitted with the five-speed automatic and a sunroof.

;August 2001 update
As part of this update, officially known as the TJ MY02 series, side impact bars previously fitted only to export models were also introduced for Australian market cars, and the front doors now featured energy absorbing material. The Magna Executive received ABS and power windows as standard, while the Advance, Sports and VR-X were each fitted with a six speaker sound system (up from four), automatic climate control, front map lamps, glove box lamp and power antenna. The Verada Xi&#x27;s electric sunroof with front map lamps and C pillar courtesy lamps was now optional on all models. The Sports was further distanced from the VR-X by no longer sharing the same boot lid spoiler, but a smaller version (which became another optional accessory across the Magna range, and was fitted as standard on subsequent limited-run models, the Verada GTV and Diamante VR-X). Power for the standard (non &quot;high output&quot;) 3.5-litre V6 engine increased to thanks to a higher compression ratio and a Karman Vortex airflow meter. The instrument cluster now had an integrated digital odometer and trip meter, as opposed to the previous analogue setup. The above engine power increase also interested the Verada range. Moreover, the Ei was now fitted with a new chrome grille, while both the Ei and Xi received new design alloy-wheels and illuminated vanity mirrors. With this update all cars now had clear front turn bezels.

A limited-run Magna V6 Si, based on the Executive sedan, launched in September 2001. Its main features included by 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control and power windows as standard. Externally, it had the new Sports&#x27; boot lid spoiler and body-coloured grille, side mouldings, splash protectors, air dam and door mirrors.

Finally, MMAL also released a further and final 95 leather packs for the VR-X, produced in November 2001.

In March 2002, MMAL also launched the limited-run Magna Commonwealth Games edition. Based on the Executive sedan, it was further equipped with a front passenger airbag, six-disc CD player, cruise control, floor mats and power antenna. Externally, it has 16-inch alloy wheels, &quot;Commonwealth Games&quot; badging and body-coloured features as on V6 Si.

;Magna Sports wagon and Ralliart
MMAL&#x27;s push to scroll off perceptions of conservatism lead to the showcasing of two prototypes at the 2001 Sydney Motor Show: a Magna Ralliart sedan and Magna Sports wagon. The latter was a Magna wagon with Sports/VR-X drivetrain, with a dark purple ChromaFlair exterior and interior centre console, full bodykit accented in silver, lowered suspension and aftermarket 17-inch ROH Adrenalin alloy wheels. It was launched two months later with a more conventional interior and standard 16-inch alloy wheels of the Magna Sports sedan.

The Ralliart concept in sedan form only, was a further development of the VR-X and the most powerful Magna ever designed to leverage off Mitsubishi&#x27;s World Rally Championship exploits. In fact, its overall styling was based on the legendary Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution range, in particular the front bumper bar (void of any fog lights) and its bi-plane deck lid spoiler inspired by the limited edition Lancer Evolution VI TME (the rest of the body kit included carry-over VR-X wheel arch extensions plus unique side skirts and squared-off chrome exhaust tip). Among other things, in prototype form, Magna Ralliart was said to feature AWD, Supercharged, Recaro front seats, MOMO steering wheel and gear levers as part of a loud black and bright red interior. 500 individually numbered Ralliart models had been planned.

Due to budget constraints, however, the Ralliart (codenamed &quot;TJ0R42&quot;) was brought to market in February 2002 still as an individually numbered vehicle, but only with a FWD platform and with less third party-sourced fittings. In fact, the front seats ended up being the standard Mitsubishi-designed Magna seats, but with revised side bolsters; the standard Magna&#x27;s steering wheel and gear levers were retained, although the former was leather wrapped (black and red) in Italy by MOMO; the red-only instrument cluster dials (but with a &quot;Ralliart&quot; inscribed rev counter) and silver interior trims for the centre console and tunnel were sourced from the VR-X Limited Edition (without the Verada-sourced chrome gear plate for the automatic fitted to the VR-X). The sound system was a complete upgrade, however, being a 14-speaker Fujitsu Ten Eclipse tuner with CD player and remote control. This car also became the first local Mitsubishi product to offer datadot paint technology.

Mechanically, the speed-limited Ralliart (compared to for the Sports/VR-X) featured 17x7-inch &quot;Enkei&quot; premium alloy wheels shod with Pirelli performance tyres (instead of locally sourced Bridgestone tyres), and Koni suspension dampers (tuned by Mitsubishi and optimised with the local Koni agent, Toperformance) with similar same spring rates and 22 mm front, 18 mm rear anti-roll bars as the Magna Sports/VR-X, new power steering pump to increase weight and feedback, upsized brake disks from the Mitsubishi Diamante AWD and revised fuel tank to prevent starvation during high speed manoeuvres. The 294 mm front ventilated discs and 284 mm rear ventilated discs featured harder material and were 18 mm and 26 mm bigger than other Magna models, which have solid rear discs. Front twin-piston and rear single-piston callipers provided 26 and 32 percent more pad area, front pads sourced from Japan and rear pads from Australia, featuring the same friction material as the VR-X.

The engine was a reworked version of the 6G74 design fitted to Magna Sports and VR-X, but now generating 210 kW thanks to a more aggressive cam profile, modified head and combustion chamber (compression ratio from the Sports/VR-X&#x27;s 9.0:1 to 9.4:1), remapped ECU and a modified Magna VR-X exhaust system – featuring stainless-steel extractors by HM Headers (the latter on their own contributing to a power boost of only 2–3 kW) and larger muffler in the centre pipe (to improve mid- and high-rev exhaust note). Ralliart was available with either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. A sunroof was the only option, Leather was offered as an option to company owned cars. The hardware for the automatic transmission was effectively lifted from Sports/VR-X models, in that it featured the same &quot;TCL&quot; traction control unit (instead of the LSD exclusive to the manual Ralliart, from the Mitsubishi FTO GPX) but with altered shift patterns.

;TJ and KJ Series 2
Released in July 2002, these series (also known as TJ II and KJ II) comprised further and final incremental updates until the launch of the redesigned TL and KL series. &quot;Tiptronic&quot; was introduced to the four-speed automatic for the Executive and Advance models—making this function standard on all Magna automatics. Executive and Advance also gained new wheel trims, new grey-only interior trim and body-coloured grille surrounds. The 3.0-litre V6 engine for the Executive was dropped in favour of the 3.5-litre version.

The KJ Series 2 Verada also saw the introduction of &quot;Tiptronic&quot; to their five-speed automatic transmissions, whereas inside, there were a new instrument cluster, two-tone black/slate or black/sandstone colour schemes and chrome gearshift surrounds. The Ei gained a power adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, while the Xi also featured with a power adjustable front passenger seat and Nardi wood gearshift knob. The range was expanded with the arrival of the limited-edition GTV. Specifically, this Verada was powered by the 3.5-litre &quot;high output&quot; V6 engine of the Magna Sports and VR-X, the upgraded VR-X sports suspension and black brake callipers, new design 17-inch alloy wheels shod with 225/50 Bridgestone tyres, the Sports&#x27; boot lid spoiler and rear muffler, and unique interior fittings comprising an eight-speak sound system with a four-disc in-dash CD player, satellite navigation, black leather seats with perforated inserts, black leather door inserts and console lid, and a Nardi wood steering wheel and gear knob. This model became a permanent range fixture from March 2003, when it was rebadged GTVi.

In December 2002, the TJ and KJ Series 2 range was further expanded by the AWD range, fitted with Mitsubishi&#x27;s locally developed &quot;Quadtec&quot;, as detailed below.

In April 2003, MMAL also launched an Executive and Advance range with a dedicated LPG system, available only with an automatic transmission. These models became the very first Magnas with this factory-fitted option, powered by a modified 3.5-litre V6 engines delivering a decreased maximum power of at 5000 rpm and maximum torque of at 4000 rpm. Luggage capacity also decreased from 460 to 325 litres. The total development cost was .

In November 2002, a Magna Limited Edition (also known as the &quot;LE&quot;) was the final special edition model launched to boost sales of the TJ series. It was, essentially, a 4-speed automatic transmission Executive that featured the Verada Ei&#x27;s full leather trim (seats, door inserts and steering wheel), front parabolic headlights (of the original KJ series with amber turning lights), cruise control, 16-inch alloy wheels, fog lights as well as a passenger-side airbag. As with other non-sports limited editions, externally, it was distinguished by its body-coloured mirrors, side protection mouldings and side air dams.

;All-wheel drive
By far the biggest highlight of the TJ Series 2 was the introduction of the sedan-only Magna/Verada AWD range, whose mechanicals remained available to the market until 2005, when the new, FWD-only, Mitsubishi 380 was launched.

Marketed as &quot;Quadtec&quot;, the AWD system sought to leverage off Mitsubishi&#x27;s international rally heritage and carried a development cost of $10 million. With its introduction, MMAL could claim the title of being the first Australian mass-built AWD passenger car (excluding the XY Falcon-based commercial utility produced and sold by Ford Australia in the 1970s). The range comprised only three sedans available only with the five-speed automatic transmissions: Magna AWD, Magna Sport AWD and Verada AWD.

With Magna now competing well in terms of overall size, the AWD development was an attempt by MMAL to counter Australians&#x27; long held perception that its perennial RWD rivals – the market-dominant Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore – offered better handling. This led to a advertising campaign including on television, which portrayed a high speed sprint involving a Magna AWD, Holden Commodore (VY) and Ford Falcon (BA), with the latter RWD cars oversteering wildly out of control on a dirt bend. The television advertisement became the subject of complaints alleging that it promoted unsafe driving. This resulted in MMAL being forced to make changes following the intervention of the Advertising Standards Board finding the company to be in breach of a then new national code for car advertising.

Overall, the Magna and Verada AWD failed to provide any noticeable boost in sales. The drivetrain proved to be mechanically reliable with improved handling compared to the FWD version, albeit at the cost of lower performance and official fuel consumption figures. Specifically, Magna AWD and Verada AWD shared the / engine, while the Sports AWD had a / version. Those power and torque outputs – and overall performance – were down on equivalent FWD Magna&#x27;s due to structural revisions (chiefly, a revised firewall developed in Australia by ROH) restricting the Sports&#x27; free flowing exhaust system, and the extra weight of the AWD hardware (up to depending on model and equipment levels). Due to budget and development constraints, the subsequent TL series Magna VR-X AWD was limited to 16-inch alloy wheels instead of the FWD&#x27;s 17-inch wheels.

Original AWD sales projections were for 300 sales per month, but actual sales by August 2003 showed that only 150 AWDs were being sold each month. Fleets and rental agencies are attributed as the biggest buyers of the initial production. The AWD system was available only on sedans and only with the five-speed automatic transmission of the FWD Magna Sports/VR-X and Verada.

;Marketing initiatives
Despite its competitive pricing relative to the key rival products from Holden, Ford, and Toyota, ongoing speculation of the Adelaide plant&#x27;s closure forced MMAL to launch extensive marketing campaigns and promotions, such as free servicing and cash-back offers. Another initiative included the TJ Magna, spearheaded by the Magna VR-X and Magna wagon models, becoming the official vehicles of the 2002 Tour Down Under international cycling event held in Adelaide. Following the Magna Ralliart and Sports wagon a year prior, in October 2002, MMAL also displayed at the Sydney Motor Show a Ralliart painted in the same yellow paint as the Lancer Evolution of the time, to renew interest in its performance range. The colour was marketed as &quot;Wasp Yellow&quot; and thus made available on the Magna VR-X, Ralliart and Verada GTVi. Prototypes painted in various ChromaFlair paints (bearing the experimental &quot;XX&quot; paint code) were also displayed over time, but never officially marketed.

=== TL / KL ===

In April 2003, an Australian-made vehicle was previewed internationally for the first time, thanks to the new KL series Diamante (based on the new Verada) being displayed at that year&#x27;s New York Motor Show. Australia had to wait for the launch of the TL and KL series (codenamed &quot;XR&quot;) until July 2003. The new series featured restyled front and rear ends, and mildly revised mechanicals and interior trims.

The project was said to have cost over (including alone for the radical new headlights) and the range no longer featured Executive, Altera or Sports models, which had been replaced by ES, LS and VR, respectively. The only carryover badge remained VR-X. A limited edition &quot;Solara&quot; was reoffered, carrying electric windows, alloy wheels and deck lid spoiler. Full leather trim became an option on the VR-X and the export Diamante went on sale in Canada for the first time.

A Ralliart-accessorised VR and VR-X Limited Edition from March 2004 was marketed with the aid of Mitsubishi rally driver, Ed Ordynski. These models featured the TJ series Magna Ralliart&#x27;s Koni suspension components and Enkei alloy wheels but no upgraded engine or brakes relative to the rest of the range. Other distinctive features included full colour-coding especially of the headlight surrounds, which was later adopted across the whole TW series.

Although mechanically the new TL and KL series remained the same as the preceding TJ, stylistically, it had been radically facelifted by French designer Olivier Boulay. Gone were the somewhat angular lines featured since the first TE series, which were instead replaced by what Mitsubishi&#x27;s new global head of design envisioned as the new Mitsubishi corporate face (a style that would eventually be grafted onto other Mitsubishi vehicles, beginning with the Lancer Evolution and Colt/Mirage). The frontal appearance of the TL/KL series had a distinctive grille, which was again divided in the middle like on the TJ series, but this time by an extension of the bumper bar and not the bonnet. Larger chrome Mitsubishi triple diamonds logo adorned the front bumper, whereas the front guards now had a swoopy appearance with triangular headlamp assemblies. On its sides, new design, colour-coded plastic door handles, rocker panels and skirts were introduced. At the rear, a rounded boot lid and bumper bar were fitted to continue the swoopy front theme, but the rear tail lights remained effectively unchanged from those of the TJ series (except for VR-X and Verada Xi AWD which featured darkened lenses). The new car&#x27;s styling was controversial and not well received by Australian buyers; sales slowed dramatically.

Three new colours were added to the TL and KL series: &quot;Tanami&quot; (metallic gold), &quot;Grange&quot; and—from September 2003 production—&quot;Starlight&quot; (a pearl white, which replaced &quot;Cocoon White&quot;).

Both the facelifted Magna and Verada benefited from a number of safety upgrades, as proven by the fact that all models met the then latest offset deformable barrier (ODB) and dynamic side impact requirements. In addition, front driver and passenger airbags became standard along with side airbags contained in the front seat bolsters. While the wheelbase of the new series had not changed, rear legroom was claimed to have been increased by reshaping the rear cushion of the front seats, the rear seat and by re-arranging the rear seat hip points and squabs. Other interior revisions included rear air vents for the first time on Magna as well as electric driver&#x27;s seat height adjustment. For the first time, a factory-fitted GPS system was also offered as an option whereas most cars gained a rotary climate control panel, without the previous digital display. Systematic cost-cutting measures included the relocation of the front power window controls on the lesser Magna models from the door panels to the centre console, plus the removal of the individual battery cover compartment in the engine bay.

The drivetrains of the TL/KL series for all models remained the same as that of the respective TJ/KJ Series 2 models, including those of the AWD and dedicated LPG models. The only difference consisted of rear stabiliser bars now fitted to all sedans.

In terms of the AWD range, by 2003 sales extended to private buyers following the initial uptake by fleets (such as the NSW and New Zealand Police) and rental agencies. In TL guise, Sports models were now renamed as VR and, apart from AWD-specific driving and handling characteristics, MMAL relied on minimal badging to differentiate this range from FWD models. On the competition front, the TL Magna AWD entered in the Australian Cup class of the Australian Rally Championship in 2004, winning on debut—albeit as the only car entered in its class.

In June 2004, VR models were discontinued, leaving the VR-X 2WD as the sporty model in the Magna range. A new VR-X AWD model was also announced at this time, going on sale 1 August (with the update for both models labelled MY04) but only offering 16-inch wheels as opposed to the 17-inch version fitted to the 2WD. VR-Xs were now distinguished by body coloured headlight bezels, a body coloured upper grille, silver mesh lower grille, a platinum coloured rear bumper insert (except for &quot;Platinum&quot; coloured cars, which received a &quot;Sable&quot; insert), and an extended chrome exhaust outlet. Mitsubishi also revised badging, with the &quot;AWD&quot; badge no longer on the front fender, and the &quot;Magna&quot; badge removed from the rear decklid. A &quot;VR-X&quot; badge is located on the right-hand side of the decklid, with an &quot;AWD&quot; badge situated on the left-hand side on AWD models. A &quot;QuadTec&quot; badge is located immediately underneath the &quot;AWD&quot; decklid badge, and an &quot;AWD&quot; decal is located on the lower rear doors of the all-wheel drive variants. Inside, a revised black cloth upholstery is standard, with black leather trim now extending to the steering wheel, transmission lever and handbrake. Colours were revised for the MY04 VR-Xs, with the release of &quot;Platinum&quot; metallic (replacing &quot;Pewter&quot;), &quot;Zen&quot; pearlescent (replacing &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;), and &quot;Fusion&quot;.

Overall, the TL Magna was hampered by its old architecture and design which was not more heavily redeveloped or replaced altogether due to the ever-increasing financial crisis that hit Mitsubishi&#x27;s North American operations, plus a notorious recall scandal that tarnished Mitsubishi of Japan at the time (and caused its then partner, Daimler-Chrysler, to eventually sever its commercial links).

=== TW / KW ===

A minor facelift, coded as the TW series Magna and KW Verada, launched in October 2004 and can be differentiated by &quot;Series II&quot; badging and colour-coded headlight bezels for the Magna ES and LS and larger US-spec bumpers for Verada models. Mitsubishi adjusted the model range, with the Magna LS sedan (but not wagon) disappearing from the range, the base Magna AWD becoming the Magna LS AWD sedan, and the addition of the Verada GTVi AWD sedan, a combination of the former KL Verada GTVi and Verada AWD. The &quot;Platinum&quot;, &quot;Zen&quot;, and &quot;Fusion&quot; paint colours added to the KL MY04 VR-X in June were now available on most models.

With slowing sales, MMAL launched an extended warranty campaign applicable to all cars sold from 1 December 2004. The new market leading warranty programme extended full manufacturer&#x27;s coverage from three to five years or , whichever came first, and gave a further five years or of coverage on the driveline components to the original owner only. In addition, MMAL launched an advertising campaign that starred MMAL&#x27;s then CEO Tom Phillips stating to potential customers &quot;If you can find a better built car—buy it!&quot;. This approach recycled the advertising used by Chrysler in the US in the early 1980s, when Lee Iacocca used a similar slogan. Both strategies helped reduce the number of stockpiled vehicles from 5,500 in September 2004 down to 800 by June 2005—an important requirement in the lead-up to the launch of the Mitsubishi 380 replacement in October.

Given its long-serving architecture and slow sales from circa 2000, MMAL management specifically excluded the Magna as a name for its replacement—the eventual 380. However, TL and TW Magnas became popular in the second hand market given their sound engineering, reliability and low resale values—the latter due in part to heavy discounting when new and also of its 380 successor.

== Sales ==
===Exports===
Throughout the Magna and Verada&#x27;s time on sale, Mitsubishi Australia exported the model to a variety different countries. The Northern American market saw the luxurious Verada range imported as the Diamante. It was also sold in the United Kingdom, where they imported the Magna Wagon and Diamante Sedan (from Japan) to be collectively sold under the Sigma Nameplate.

Mitsubishi also imported the Verada Wagon, (as the Diamante), into Japan to complement their own Diamante Sedan.

New Zealand saw both nameplates imported, with the added induction of the Mitsubishi V3000. 
In smaller markets, the Magna was exported to the Middle East.
The following table lists the Export Markets.

<text>Robert L. Millet (born 30 December 1947) is a professor of ancient scripture and emeritus Dean of Religious Education at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Millet is a Latter-day Saint author and speaker with more than 60 published works on virtually all aspects of Mormonism. Millet was at the forefront of establishing evangelical-Mormon dialogue.

He appears frequently as a commentator on BYUtv and in other visible roles at assorted media outlets as Manager of Outreach and Interfaith Relations for the LDS Church&#x27;s Public Affairs Department. 

Millet is considered one of the foremost scholars on the Joseph Smith Translation (also known as the Inspired Version) of the Bible.

==Life==
Millet was born and raised in Louisiana where his grandparents had joined the LDS Church. He received a BA and a master&#x27;s in psychology from BYU, and a Ph.D. from Florida State University in biblical studies and contemporary theology. Millet has been a member of the BYU faculty since 1983.

Millet married Shauna Sizemore Millet at the Salt Lake Temple in 1971; they are the parents of six children.

<doc id="903921" wikidata="Q904690" url="?curid=903921" title="Dextre">
<text>Dextre, also known as the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), is a two-armed robot, or telemanipulator, which is part of the Mobile Servicing System on the International Space Station (ISS), and does repairs that would otherwise require astronauts to do spacewalks. It was launched on March 11, 2008, on the mission STS-123.

Dextre is a part of Canada&#x27;s contributions to the ISS and was named to represent its dexterous nature. Dextre is the newest of three Canadian robotic arms used on the ISS, preceded by the Space Shuttle&#x27;s Canadarm and the large Canadarm2. Dextre was designed and manufactured by MDA.

In the early morning of February 4, 2011, Dextre completed its first official assignment which consisted of unpacking two pieces for Kounotori 2 while the on-board crew was sleeping.

==Purpose==
Dextre is designed to handle and complete orbital replacement units: Many spares are stored on the ISS and Dextre is able to carry them to and from worksites and install replacements when failures occur. Before Dextre arrived astronauts were required to perform space walks to carry out this long work.

==Structure==
Dextre resembles a gigantic torso fitted with two extremely agile, arms. Total mass is about . The 3.5-metre-long body pivots at the &quot;waist&quot;. The body has a Power Data grapple fixture at the &#x27;head&#x27; end that can be grasped by the larger Space Station Arm, Canadarm2 so that Dextre can be positioned at the various Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) worksites around the Space Station. The other end of the body has a Latching End Effector virtually identical to that of Canadarm2, so that Dextre can also be attached to Space Station grapple fixtures or the Mobile Base System.

Dextre can also be operated whilst it is attached to the end of Canadarm2.

Each arm is somewhat like a shortened Canadarm2 (in that it has 7 joints) but is fixed to Dextre at one end.

At the end of Dextre&#x27;s arms are ORU/Tool Changeout Mechanisms (OTCM). The OTCM has built-in grasping jaws, a retractable socket drive, a monochrome TV camera, lights, and an umbilical connector that can provide power, data, and video to/from a payload.

Dextre moves one arm at a time, while one arm may hold onto the station (using specially provided standard H or Micro interfaces) for stability and ease of control the other is available to perform tasks.

==Tools==
The lower body of Dextre has a pair of orientable colour TV cameras with lights, a platform for stowing ORUs, and a tool holster. The tool holster is equipped with two Robotic Micro Conical Tools (RMCTs), which allow an arm to grasp additional types of ORU fixtures. The Socket Extension Tool (SET) extends the length of the grasping socket on an arm, and the Robotic Off-Set Tool (ROST) allows an arm to grasp difficult-to-reach targets.
Several new tools were added as part of the 2011 Robotic Refueling Mission. A Wire Cutter, Safety Cap Removal Tool, EVR Nozzle Tool and a Multifunction Tool with several adapters. These tools are not installed on Dextre but are used by Dextre when performing RRM operations. The tools are not considered a part of Dextre&#x27;s complement of tools and are stowed on the RRM platform.

In 2013 the H-II Transport Vehicle brought the RRM On-orbit Transfer Cage (ROTC), which is a sliding table within the Japanese airlock platform from which to retrieve and subsequently install new hardware.

The Visual Inspection Poseable Invertebrate Robot (VIPIR), a borescope camera with a 34-inch long flexible tube, was added as part of the Robotic Refueling Mission — Phase 2. It was delivered to the station in 2014.

In 2015, the International Space Station Robotic External Leak Locator (IRELL), developed by NASA, was delivered to the ISS. It includes a mass spectrometer and an ion vacuum pressure gauge to detect leaks of ammonia, one of the coolants used on the International Space Station.

===Future possibilities===
SARAH (Self-Adaptive Robotic Auxiliary Hand) is a three-fingered hand that is designed to attach to the end of Dextre&#x27;s arm. It has not been delivered to the ISS.

==Design and delivery==
Dextre was designed and manufactured by MDA Space Missions (now MDA) as part of the $200 million contracted by the Canadian Space Agency, which will oversee its future operations and the necessary training of station crews.

It completed all necessary testing and was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, in mid-June 2007. Once at KSC, it underwent flight verification testing followed by shuttle integration.

==Installation==
Dextre was launched to the ISS on March 11, 2008, aboard on mission STS-123. It &quot;woke up&quot; and activated heaters needed for keeping its joints and electronics warm after receiving power from the space station&#x27;s Canadarm2 on March 14. During the mission&#x27;s second spacewalk on March 16, spacewalking astronauts attached the two arms to the robot&#x27;s main body and further prepared the machine for its handyman job on the station. After the spacewalk, crew members hooked Dextre back up to the station&#x27;s robotic arm to keep it warm and to allow NASA to perform tests to ensure all of Dextre&#x27;s electronics were working properly. Later that day, the crew tested all of its joints and brakes. Astronauts finished outfitting the robot during a third spacewalk on March 17, 2008.

==Operational use==

After testing and trials, the first planned use was in the removal and replacement of an RPCM (Remote Power Control Module) in 2009.

In the early morning of February 4, 2011, Dextre completed its first official assignment which consisted of unpacking two pieces for Kounotori 2 while the on-board crew was sleeping.

As flight controllers have gained experience planning and executing Dextre operations, its use has become a more critical part of ISS maintenance. It is capable of removing and replacing (R&amp;R) many ORUs on the ISS that would normally otherwise require costly and risky spacewalks to repair. Examples of items successfully R&amp;R&#x27;d include RPCMs, an external camera, a Pump Flow Control Subassembly, and a Main Bus Switching Unit. It is also relied on heavily for extracting experiments and payloads from visiting vehicles, installing them to their final locations on the exterior of the ISS. Finally, Dextre supports scientific research and robotics development through experiments such as the Robotics External Leak Locator, Robotic Refueling Mission, and the Materials International Space Station Experiment Flight Facility (MISSE-FF).

== Other mentions ==

In early August 2004 NASA declared its intention to use Dextre (or a close copy of it) as the robotic component for the Hubble Space Telescope rescue mission. Months after awarding a contract to MDA to provide an SPDM copy for the Hubble repair mission, NASA then canceled the mission in favour of flying a Shuttle mission to perform the repairs/upgrades. NASA cited excessive risks and new-found confidence in the Space Shuttle external tank as reasons for the cancellation.

Dextre was the subject of an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke article on April 1, 2008, on NASA&#x27;s APOD website.

Dextre was also featured in the new $5 Canadian Polymer bank note together with Canadarm2, which Commander Chris Hadfield helped reveal aboard the International Space Station.

<text>The Leyland Hundred (also known as Leylandshire) is a historic subdivision of the English county of Lancashire. It covered the parishes of Brindle, Chorley, Croston, Eccleston, Hoole, Leyland, Penwortham, Rufford, Standish and Tarleton.

In the Domesday Book the area was recorded as &#x27;Lailand&#x27; Hundred, with Chorley Parish in Warmundestrou Hundred and Eccleston Parish in Duddeston Hundred, all included in the returns for Cheshire. However, it cannot be said clearly to have been part of Cheshire.

<doc id="903958" wikidata="Q4747988" url="?curid=903958" title="Amounderness Hundred">
<text>The Amounderness Hundred ( ) is one of the six subdivisions of the historic county of Lancashire in North West England, but the name is older than the system of hundreds first recorded in the 13th century and might best be described as the name of a Norse wapentake. In the Domesday Book of 1086, it was used for some territories north of the River Ribble included together with parts of Yorkshire. The area eventually became part of Lancashire, sitting geographically between the Rivers Lune and Ribble, in the strip of coast between the Irish Sea and Bowland Forest.

==Etymology and history==

In the 19th century, the name was considered to have been first recorded in 705, as Hacmunderness. The Domesday Book in 1086 spells it Agemundrenessa.

There are two suggested etymologies for Amounderness. The traditional 19th-century reading was that the name derived from &quot;ac&quot; (oak) and &quot;mund&quot; (protection), &quot;a ness or promontory sheltered by oaks&quot;. This was given currency by Porter.

The current view is that the area is named after Agmundr, a Norse warlord, vassal of Eowils, Halfdan and Ingwaer, co-kings of Jorvik, all four of whom died at the Battle of Tettenhall near Wednesfield and Wolverhampton in August 910; Partington&#x27;s early 20th-century description of &quot;Amounder ... the first Viking who settled in the Fylde country&quot; now being considered more fanciful than historically accurate. It was usual for the name of hundreds to refer to a &quot;moot-stow&quot; or meeting place and the element &quot;-ness&quot; (ON, promontory) suggests the Over-Wyre as one distinct possibility. There is some evidence to suggest the line of the Wyre/Calder rivers may have marked a north–south sub-division of the hundred in the early 10th century.

In &quot;The Place-names of Lancashire&quot;, Eilert Ekwall supports an early 10th-century coinage citing &quot;A[g]hemundesnes&quot; and the late 11th-century &quot;Agmundrenesse&quot;. The etymology of Agmundr is Old West Scandinavian &quot;agi-&quot; (&quot;awe, terror&quot;) or possibly the German &quot;*ag-&quot; (&quot;point, weapon point&quot;), with &quot;-mundr&quot;, from Old West Scandinavian &quot;*-munduR&quot; (&quot;protection&quot;). The name appears in Old Swedish as &quot;Aghmund&quot; and in Old West Norse as &quot;Ogmundr&quot;. While the formal title of the warrior was almost certainly &quot;Agmundrholdr&quot;, his familiar or lall-name would have been &quot;Mundi&quot;.

Victorian commentators, such as Porter, often cited a 7th-century grant made at Ripon by Ecgfrith of Northumbria and Æthelwine as proof that Amounderness existed before the 10th century. In fact, the grant itself has not survived, its only source being an early 8th-century hagiography of the Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid – &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; – by Stephen of Ripon (also known was Eddius Stephanus). There is no reference to Amounderness in this text, merely to lands &quot;iuxta Rippel&quot; (next to the Ribble). The historical misattribution may be due to the 16th-century antiquarian John Leland who cites Hasmundesham (possibly Amounderness) in his &quot;Collectanea&quot;, originally published in 1632, but does so without proper supporting evidence.

Amounderness was granted to Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York in June 934 by Æthelstan, King of England. Once thought a spoil of battle, the area had in fact been purchased by Aethelstan in 926. According to the grant, the extent of Amounderness was much greater than its present-day counterpart being the land &quot;from the sea along the Cocker to the source of that river, from that source straight to another spring which is called in Saxon, Dunshop, thus down the riverlet to the Hodder, in the same direction to the Ribble and thus along that river through the middle of the channel to the sea&quot;. It is unclear from this description whether &quot;Dunshop&quot; refers to the westerly tributary of the river (i.e. the Brennand) or the easterly (i.e.. the Whitendale) but this distinction would have significant territorial implications.

Less precisely, Ekwall describes the eastern boundary of Amounderness as &quot;being formed by the fells on the Yorkshire border&quot;. This places the boundary within the modern-day Forest of Bowland where Dunsop Bridge sits close to the eastern mouth of the Trough of Bowland that straddles the traditional Lancashire-Yorkshire border. After the Norman conquest of England, this eastern portion of Amounderness became part of the Lordship of Bowland. However, Thorn argues that &quot;it was only along the river Hodder on the western and south-western edges of the Forest of Bowland that the division between Amounderness and Craven corresponded in any way to the later boundary between Lancashire and Yorkshire&quot;. Indeed, he even suggests that Amounderness may have been a &quot;subdivision of Craven&quot; which he describes as &quot;stretching from the Irish Sea over the Pennines to touch the Yorkshire wapentakes of Burghshire and &#x27;Skyrack&#x27;&quot; ... the area around the headwaters of the rivers Aire and Wharfe and upper Ribblesdale&quot;.

In the 10th century, Amounderness would have been strategically important in terms of the Dublin-York axis. Its strategic importance is mirrored on the east coast by Holderness in the East Riding of Yorkshire. By the 12th century, Amounderness and Bowland had become two distinct and separate Lordships, each centred on its own seigneurial, later royal forest.

==Geography==
The hundred of Amounderness corresponds to today&#x27;s administrative districts of Fylde, Wyre, Preston and part of Ribble Valley (north of the River Ribble and within the historic boundaries of Lancashire). It included Bispham, Blackpool, Broughton-in-Amounderness, Chipping, Cockerham, Garstang, Kirkham, Knott End-on-Sea, Mitton, Pilling, Preesall, Poulton-le-Fylde, Preston, and Ribchester.

The name is preserved in the present-day Amounderness Way, which is part of the A585 road that runs between Mains Lane in Thornton and Dock Street in Fleetwood.

==Amounderness in popular culture==
In his 1858 novel &quot;Mervyn Clitheroe&quot;, William Harrison Ainsworth portrays the minor character of the Earl of Amounderness whose &quot;sylvan domains ... at Dunton Park ... boasted much noble timber&quot;. Ainsworth&#x27;s protagonist Mervyn Clitheroe shoots a buck &quot;in the domains of Lord Amounderness.&quot;

==Amounderness registration district==

Amounderness was also the name of a registration district for births, deaths and marriages from 1 April 1935 to 31 March 1974. Previously, since 1837, its parishes were part of Preston Registration District. It consisted of Preston Rural District, Fulwood Urban District and Longridge Urban District, covering an area surrounding (but excluding) Preston that was much smaller than the hundred, including areas south of the Ribble that were outside the hundred. It comprised the civil parishes of Barton, Broughton, Cuerdale, Farington, Fulwood, Goosnargh, Grimsargh, Haighton, Hutton, Lea, Little Hoole, Longton, Much Hoole, Penwortham, Samlesbury, Walton-le-Dale, Whittingham and Woodplumpton (all of which were transferred to Preston and South Ribble registration district in 1974), and Alston, Dilworth, Dutton, Hothersall and Ribchester (which were transferred to Ribble Valley registration district).

<doc id="903965" wikidata="Q1324018" url="?curid=903965" title="Nissan Bluebird">
<text>The is a compact car produced between 1955 and 2007 with a model name introduced in 1957. It was Nissan&#x27;s most internationally recognized sedan, known for its dependability and durability in multiple body styles. The Bluebird originated from Nissan&#x27;s first vehicles, dating to the early 1900s, and its traditional competitor became the Toyota Corona. The Bluebird was positioned to compete with the Corona, as the Corona was developed to continue offering a sedan used as a taxi since the Toyota Crown was growing in size. Every generation of the Bluebird has been available as a taxi, duties that are shared with base level Nissan Cedrics. It is one of the longest-running nameplates from a Japanese automaker. It spawned most of Nissan&#x27;s products sold internationally, and has been known by a number of different names and bodystyles, including the Auster/Stanza names.

== Export and foreign-built model names ==
Export versions were sold variously as the Datsun 510, Datsun 180B (with 160B and 200B versions) and the Datsun Bluebird. The Nissan Bluebird nameplate began appearing around 1982 as the Datsun marque was phased out in favour of Nissan.

From 1981 to 1985, Australia followed the Japanese convention by calling its car the Bluebird, and had a unique, facelifted rear-wheel-drive version for 1984 and 1985. That car was replaced in 1986 by the Nissan Pintara. It would be replaced by the successive Bluebird, also called Pintara, until 1992; then the range was brought in line with the Japanese model, for the U13 series from 1993 to 1997. In an unusual twist, brought about under the short lived Button Plan, the Pintara was also rebadged for Ford Australia as the Ford Corsair – reviving a Ford UK nameplate last used in the 1960s.

In the United States, the Bluebird was initially sold as a Datsun, named by engine size, until the introduction of the 510 which was sold by the internal model code. By the 1980s, the Bluebird was sold as the Nissan Stanza in the US. In 1992, the next generation Bluebird became the Nissan Altima. This was the last car from the Bluebird line to be sold in North America; in 1998, the Altima was completely redesigned, becoming a separate model, unique to the North American market. A six-cylinder version called the Maxima (originally the Datsun 810) was released in the 1980s and became a separate model. The Bluebird sold in Europe between 1986 and 1990 was in fact a rebadged Nissan Auster — this was replaced by the Primera in Nissan&#x27;s European line-up in 1990.

== Historic vehicles ==
The DAT corporation had been producing cars since 1914, but through the 1920s, much of their profitability depended on government subsidies of their large trucks. A 1930 ministerial ordinance by the Japanese government declared that drivers&#x27; licenses would not be required for cars with engines up to 500 cc displacement, and that the purchase of these vehicles would be taxed at a lower rate. DAT began to produce a small car for this market. The new car was called &quot;Datson&quot;(i.e. &quot;Son of DAT&quot;) and later &quot;Datsun&quot; to distinguish it from the full-sized trucks and cars the company had produced in the past.

=== Datsun Type 10 – 17 ===

==== Type 10 ====

In 1929, DAT built a small-car prototype called the DAT 91. They ended up marketing this model as the DATSON Type 10 (&quot;son of DAT&quot;), since it was a shrunken version of the earlier 31. &quot;DAT&quot; was now a backronym for Durable, Attractive, and Trustworthy. The car fit into a new category of small cars, limited to half a litre&#x27;s displacement. The production version was powered by DAT&#x27;s own four-cylinder, side-valve engine of 495 cc. It (and the inauspicious &quot;DATSON&quot; name, with &quot;son&quot; being close to 損, the Japanese word for &quot;loss&quot;) was replaced by the Datsun Type 11 in 1932.
==== Types 11 – 14 ====
The 1932 Datsun Type 11 was a small car with a 495 cc, 10 HP side valve engine and a three speed transmission. [JSAE]. It was offered in several body styles, and DAT/Nissan sold 150 of the Type 11 in 1932. [JSAE] The Type 11 was only produced during the year 1932, as changes in the law allowed Nissan to sell a new model with a larger engine in 1933.

The Datsun Type 11 had the same engine displacement and external dimensions as an Austin Seven, and information about the British car was widely available within Japan. In October and November 1929, the chief engineer of Austin presented a paper in Tokyo called &quot;The British Light Car&quot;. This paper is supposed to have provided detailed explanations and illustrations of many of the mechanical components of the Austin Seven. The exact relationship between the two cars is, however, in dispute. Some authors say that it was a licensed copy of the Seven. Others insist it was a copy, but not an authorized one. Herbert Austin was definitely concerned about the possibility of the Datsun infringing on his patents; he subsequently imported a 1935 Datsun to examine, but decided not to file a complaint. Some websites have pointed to this as evidence supporting the hypothesis that the Datsun was not a copy of the Austin. Other websites have pointed out that the decision to not press charges might have been because that by then the Datsun designs had begun to differ from those of the Austin.

The 1933 Datsun Type 12 was a small car produced by the Nissan corporation. The name Datsun was used by DAT for their line of small cars. After the DAT corporation was absorbed into Nissan, these cars continued to be produced, and the original model name was maintained. The Type 12 was basically similar to the earlier 1932 Type 11, but had a larger engine.

Japanese laws at that time did not require a license to drive automobiles with small-displacement engines. DAT/Nissan produced the Datsun Type 11 as their entry into this market. The original limitation for this class of vehicles was 500 cc displacement engines, but that was changed to 750 cc in 1933. Nissan responded to this change by producing a larger engine, and gave the more powerful car a new name, the Type 12.

The 1934 Datsun Type 13 went into production in April 1934 with its chassis built in the &quot;Osaka Plant of the Automotive Division of Tobata Casting&quot;, which merged with &quot;Nihon Sangyo Co.&quot; (Nissan) after selling its factory. Its grille was chrome plated with a tall heart shaped opening instead of the Austin 7 like grille. It is the first Datsun model to have a truck variant called the 13T, along as being the first car exported from Japan; a total of 44 vehicles were exported to South Africa and Australia.

The 1935 Datsun Type 14 is externally very similar to the Type 13 but uses the addition of a leaping rabbit emblem at the front. Mechanically, the old DAT engine of the Datsun 13 was replaced with the Datsun Type 7 engine, a side valve four-cylinder engine with a displacement of 722 cc (44.1 cu in). It marked &quot;the birth of the Japanese car industry&quot; according to Britain&#x27;s National Motor Museum at Beaulieu. Nissan produced the vehicle at Yokohama, along with its commercial truck version called the 14T.
==== Type 15 – 17 ====
The 1936 Datsun Type 15 was mechanically very similar to the preceding Datsun Type 14. The Type 7 engine was retained, by with a higher compression ratio, increased from 5.2 to 5.4, which increased power by 1 hp (0.75 kW). All Datsun 15 models have bumpers. Both the Type 15 and 15T were produced in Yokohama in May 1936, with the 15T having a different engine cover that has near vertical vents instead of the cars horizontal vents.

The Datsun Type 16 is the successor of the Type 15. It could only be differentiated externally by detailing on the bonnet and changes in the bonnet mascot and its logo.

The last Datsun small car is the Datsun Type 17 which is distinguished by a wide vertical bar in middle of the front grille. Production began in April 1938 and according to Nissan, continued until January 1944, although David Bent claims that it finished in late 1938 as part of the cessation civilian car production that followed the Japanese decision to focus on military vehicles. The Datsun Type 17T resumed production after the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1949 until the 1955 introduction of the all new Datsun 120-series truck.

=== Datsun DA/DB/DC/DS/DW series ===
Nissan resumed automobile production starting in November 1947 with the Datsun DA series. The DA was a very modest and simple car based on the Type 17, with bodywork made partially of wood as a result of materials shortages. The better equipped and more modern looking DB &quot;Deluxe&quot; series was added in March 1948. Nissan also offered commercial vehicles, and the DA was sold as the Datsun 1121 truck, which was essentially the DA with a shortened cab for the front seat and an exposed cargo area attached to the chassis. An open-top roadster/convertible called the Datsun DC-3 appeared 12 January 1952, largely created by Yuichi Ohta. Yuichi was the son of Hiro Ohta, who founded the Ohta Jidosha car company, which produced cars in Japan between 1934 and 1957, until it became part of Tokyu Kogyo Kurogane shortly thereafter. The Datsun DS appeared in 1950, replacing the DA series as Datsun&#x27;s Standard Sedan.

All of these models were built on the identical pre-war chassis, itself a copy of or at least heavily inspired by the Austin 7. The chassis is short and with a narrow tread, as do most inter-war British cars, leading to somewhat ungainly designs with large overhangs on all sides as Datsun attempted to incorporate the post-war automobile design language. The one major change took place in August 1951, when the wheelbase was increased from to accommodate a four-door body (or more cargo space in case of the trucks). The DA and DS (Standard) were the entry-level Datsuns, with the Deluxe DB being more modern and better equipped. In 1952 Nissan entered into an engineering cooperation with the British Austin Motor Company, and offered a Japanese-built Austin A40 as their top-of-the-line model.
== 110 series ==

In 1955 Nissan revamped its passenger car products, began with the Datsun Sedan 110 series. It was introduced to Japan within a month of the introduction of the Toyota Crown RS series, and was smaller than the Prince Sedan introduced earlier in 1952 and the Subaru 1500 introduced in 1955. Sedans built in Japan during the 1950s were mostly intended to serve as taxis, and introduced mass production techniques, as opposed to earlier vehicles made using a slower hand-made process.

This sedan was designed to be compliant with the Japanese Government&#x27;s dimension regulations passed in 1950. The engine displacement was kept below the 1000 cc designation to reduce the annual road tax obligation, but more importantly, the engine displaced less than 910 cc as this was the upper limit for small taxis. Nissan did have an engineering relationship with the Austin Motor Company.

The Datsun 110 series used the Nissan D10 type engine based on an original (albeit Austin 7 inspired) design from before World War II. The engine is a water-cooled inline-four cylinder with two crankshaft bearings, side intake and exhaust valves, a displacement of 860 cc and with at 4000 rpm. Aside from not using the name, the A110 is the direct forerunner of the modern Bluebird line. Incremental changes were denoted by 112 and 113 codes – the 111 designation was skipped. The last model, introduced in June 1956, received an all-new, developed in-house gearbox. The earlier 110 and 112 had been using the four-speed, floor-mounted transmission from the Austin A40 Somerset (then built under license by Nissan), but the new 113 received a column-shifted four-speed unit which narrowly allowed seating for three in front. The new unit was also lighter than the Austin one. Both units received synchronization on the top three gears only, as was the norm for the time.

The 110 series was available as a sedan or as the rare W110/112/113 station wagon, which had a horizontally split tail gate. There was also a K110 listed, a two-door cabrio coach version. Based on the 110 was the stronger duty 120 series (intended for commercial usage), also available as a two-door delivery van, as a double cab truck, or as a two-seater pickup truck – part of the Datsun truck lineage. The 110 series&#x27; body was manufactured by Nissan Motor Kantō, using steel from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
== 210/211 series ==
Although Nissan&#x27;s own materials indicate that the Bluebird name emerged in 1959, some records show that the name first adorned a , four-door sedan in 1957, which was part of the company&#x27;s 110/210 series. Its engine was based on an Austin design, as Nissan had been building the Austin A50 Cambridge under licence in the 1950s.

The 210 was known for doubling Nissan&#x27;s production at the time and was the first Nissan to be exported to the United States. In some markets, this model was exported as the Datsun 1000. It was the first passenger car to be built in Taiwan, by the fledgling Yue Loong works, as the 1960 YLN 701 Bluebird. The 210 established an early reputation for reliability, with two of them winning the 1000 cc class in the 1958 Australia Mobilgas Rally, competing against the first generation Toyota Crown.
The 210 had succeeded the similar 110 series, which had been on sale since two years earlier. The Datsun 114 was introduced in October 1957 as a low cost option to the 210, mainly intended for taxi use. The 114 used the 210&#x27;s body except for the grille and exterior trim, combined with the old 25 PS &quot;D10&quot; engine to stay beneath the 910 cc limit imposed by the government on small taxis. Nissan did consider manufacturing a 908 cc version of the new C engine but in the end chose to keep the old sidevalve unit in production instead. The 114 was succeeded by the Datsun 115, a corresponding lower specification version of the updated 211, which was similar to the 114/210 with the exception of a bigger rear window and slightly redesigned front turn signals. Thanks to some improvements, the 115&#x27;s engine now produced and it was called the &quot;B-1&quot; engine to reflect its new overhead valve architecture. Small engine displacements also helped to keep the vehicle affordable, as the Japanese Government began to impose an annual road tax to help develop and maintain a national transportation infrastructure in 1950.

Subsequent models included the 211 (October 1958) which featured cosmetic changes, including twin taillights, a larger rear window, and chrome trim that extended to the rear fender. Power was increased somewhat, now up to at 4600 rpm. For export markets, mainly the United States and Australia, there was also a bigger engined version available. &quot;P211&quot; in internal parlance, it was marketed simply as the &quot;Datsun 1200&quot;. It has the &quot;E&quot; engine which produces at 4800 rpm. There was also the 220-series of small trucks based on the 210.

== 310/311/312 series ==
The Datsun Bluebird which debuted in August 1959 was an all-new car, and was available in Japan at the dealership sales channel &quot;Nissan Store&quot;. The 310 family was built from 1960 to 1963. There were three models built: 310 (1960), 311 (October 1960), and 312 (August 1961–1963). In Taiwan it also replaced the 701 and was known as &quot;Yue Loong Bluebird 704&quot;. The Datsun 312 was also sold in Korea. The 310 series was also built in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria in CKD form during 1962 and 1963. The model was also sold in New Zealand and was one of the first Japanese models available there, beginning in May 1962.

In October 1959, two months after introduction, a five-seater model was introduced - Japan&#x27;s first post-war, five-seater automobile. In July 1960, a five-door station wagon was added (WP310), the first station wagon to enter series production in Japan. The P310 was powered by the overhead valve 1.2-litre Nissan E engine. A smaller-engine version (simply called &quot;310&quot;) was powered by the 1.0 L Nissan C engine. The P311 and P312 (powered by the 55 hp 1.2 L Nissan E-1 engine) also had smaller-engined versions (&quot;311&quot; and &quot;312&quot;) that were powered by the 45 hp 1.0 L Nissan C-1 engine. The 310 family were all equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission (fully synchronized for the 311 and 312). The station wagon was also available for the 311 and 312, although a three-speed automatic was added to the lineup in April 1962, near the end of the 310&#x27;s run. The 312 was also available in a deluxe version (DP312). A trim model called the &quot;Fancy Deluxe&quot; (model code DP311-L) was marketed for the female driver; it featured a pale yellow exterior, pale yellow/grey interior, high heel shoe holder under the dash, a vanity mirror on the back of the driver&#x27;s side sun visor, a turn signal relay that played music, curtains, automatic clutch, and bigger mirrors. A Deluxe model arrived at the time the new, more powerful E-1 engine was introduced (October 1960).

The 311 and 312 were updated stylistically as well, with redesigned grilles, taillights, and interiors. The original model had small, half-moon shaped lights which garnered the car the nickname &quot;persimmon seed&quot;; these were replaced by larger, more squared off units with a separate, amber turn signal section.

Styling tended to mimic larger American cars. A very small number did make it to the United States. In the US, this generation was referred to as the Bluebird or simply Sedan. This generation of Bluebird became one of the first Japanese cars to be sold in significant numbers in Europe, after Finland fully opened its doors to automobile imports in mid-1962. 700 were brought in, and by the time the 410-series had arrived, Datsun had passed SAAB and Triumph in registrations. Although not very fast, the sturdy Datsun was well-suited to the rugged Finnish roads of the time.

== 410/411 series ==
In September 1963, Nissan brought the Bluebird up-to-date with boxier styling (by Pininfarina), resembling European designs, particularly the Lancia Fulvia. The 410 was built from 1964 to 1967. 

This generation Bluebird was introduced in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics as Nissan wanted to offer an all new, modern appearance in time for the games. The 410 Bluebird was Nissan&#x27;s first car of a full unibody design.

Two basic models were built: 410 (1964–1965) with a combination rear lamp set consisting of round and rectangular lenses, and 411 (1965–1967), which featured the same combination rear lamp set as the earlier 410 through 1966, changing to higher mounted rectangular tail light sets for 1967. On both, the rear direction indicators were red or amber, according to market – New Zealand, which allows either, took the 410 with both and the 411 with red only. This Bluebird was one of the first Japanese car lines assembled in New Zealand, initially imported under a tariff/duty arrangement allowing 300 cars a year (the so-called &#x27;300 Club&#x27;) with CKD kits built up by Motor Holdings at Mount Wellington in Auckland. The 410 series sedan and station wagon plus a light delivery van was assembled in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria. These cars were all in CKD format.

A sporting model, the Bluebird SS, was launched in Japan in March 1964, with a tuned 1.2 L engine. The SS was originally available only in a four-door configuration (MTK), but a two-door (RTK) joined about a year later. Two versions of the SS were built: the DP410-MTK/RTK and the DP411-MTK/RTK. The DP410 was powered by a version of the 1.2 L Nissan E-1 engine. The double-carburetted version of the J13 powered the DP411. All SS models were equipped with a four-speed manual transmission.

Initially, only a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon were in the range, but a two-door was added in September 1964. The two-door SS was launched in February 1965. The 410 and 411 were also available in a deluxe version (DP410 and DP411). A &quot;Fancy Deluxe&quot; version was also available in the home market. A DP411 SSS was entered in motor sport by the Datsun factory in South Africa and was used as test car for Nissan Japan. A Datsun DP411 SSS was also entered in the 1964 Monte Carlo rally, where it was driven by a South African, Ewold van Bergen.

To minimize production costs for export, the windshield wipers used a pattern where the wipers started in the centre and wiped towards the edge of the windshield, instead of from the passenger side towards the driver.

In May 1965 the base engine was enlarged to a downtuned version of the 1.3 L unit already used in the 411-series SS, now with a single (twin-barrel) carb and developing at 5,200 rpm. The transmission remained a three-speed. The SS was downtuned somewhat, now with but still with the four-speed unit. More excitingly, a twin-carb 1.6 L SSS model was launched the same month, with no less than . This began a line of famous Nissans in Japan, with the Bluebird SSS a mainstay of the range until its deletion in 2001.

As usual, a pickup truck version was developed and sold in parallel. For some reason it broke with the earlier standard of simply changing the second digit of the chassis code to a &quot;2&quot;, instead labelling it the 520. The commercial-use 520 further marked the divergence of Datsun&#x27;s Bluebird and truck lines as it continued to be available until 1972. Later versions received a modernized front end, similar to the contemporary 510 Bluebird.

In the United States, only the four-door sedan and wagon were offered; the two-door was never available. The 1.6-litre, featuring the same R16 engine as the SP(L)311 Roadster, was only available in 1967. The 1.2 and 1.3 410 and 411 series&#x27; had a manual gearbox, while the 1.6-litre was available as either a manual or automatic. The cars were labeled &quot;DATSUN&quot;, with no mention of Bluebird either on the car or in the owner&#x27;s manual.

In Taiwan the Bluebird 410 was built and sold as the &quot;Yue Loong YLN-705B&quot;.
== 510 series ==


Launched in August 1967, it was one of the most comprehensive Bluebird ranges in terms of body styles: a two-door sedan, a four-door sedan, a five-door station wagon, and a two-door coupé (added in November 1968). The &quot;510&quot; still enjoys considerable fame in the U.S.

Like its predecessors, the 510 Bluebird line was imported into New Zealand, this time as a single 1.6-litre, four-speed manual Deluxe model, assembled from CKD kits by Campbell Industries (later Toyota New Zealand Thames assembly plant). Local content included glass, radiator, upholstery, carpet, paint, wiring and numerous other items. A few automatic and twin carburettor SSS versions were imported built-up from Japan, primarily for buyers who had access to funds overseas and could utilise the country&#x27;s &#x27;no remittance&#x27; new car purchase scheme to avoid lengthy waiting lists.

The trim designation &quot;SS&quot; was changed to &quot;SSS&quot; as General Motors was already using the term for performance branded Chevrolet products called the Super Sport starting in 1961.

== 610 series ==
The 610 series was launched in Japan in August 1971 and was badged as the Datsun Bluebird-U. The meaning behind the U suffix is &quot;User Oriented&quot;, to signify the higher comfort levels than 510 predecessor could muster. A domestic advertising campaign used the catch-line &quot;Bluebird U – Up You!&quot;, and was short-lived due to the innuendo. The 610 was one of the first Nissan products to adopt a popular styling appearance, called &quot;coke bottle&quot; which appeared internationally during the 1960s and 1970s, an appearance shared with the larger Nissan Cedric, as both vehicles were available at Japanese Nissan dealerships called &quot;Nissan Store&quot;. The SSS hardtop coupe was the first Nissan to adopt the new bodystyle, and subsequent Nissan products soon offered the appearance in both 2- and 4-door versions for several decades.



For the Japanese domestic market, the 610 was pitted against the second generation Toyota Mark II. Also in Japan, the 610 was initially sold alongside the 510 but eventually replaced the 510. 610s were available as a four-door, two-door hardtop, and a five-door wagon/light van. Trim levels in Japan were GL (Grand Luxe), SSS (Super Sports Sedan), DX (Deluxe) or STD (Standard). It borrowed its suspension and drive train from the outgoing 510, with some modifications. Likewise, the 610 four-door and two-door retained the class-leading, independent rear trailing arm design, while the wagon reused the rear live axle with leaf springs from the 510 wagon.

Whether four or six-cylinder models, all 610s were equipped with Nissan&#x27;s L-series inline engines. In many export markets, including UK, Europe, and Australia, the 610 was badged as the 160B or 180B with respect to particular engine displacement. The Bluebird name also often appeared in advertising and in brochures. In the UK the popularity of the 160B/180B/180B SSS Coupe range further strengthened Datsun&#x27;s position as the leading Japanese importer. As a result of Japanese Government passage of emission control regulations, Nissan introduced their emissions technology in 1975, using a badge that said &quot;Nissan NAPS&quot; (Nissan Anti Pollution System) on vehicles thus equipped. Most 610s worldwide came equipped with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission, but a five-speed manual transmission was available in the Japanese and Australian markets.

As with the 510, the SSS trim included miscellaneous sport options and a higher output engine with twin-Hitachi carburetors. A Japan-only SSS-E model was equipped with Bosch-licensed electronic fuel injection, and so was one of the first, mass-produced Nissan vehicles to be sold without a carburetor. Another 610 never exported was the inline-six U-2000 GT and U-2000 GTX (nicknamed &quot;shark-nose&quot; in Japanese), which shows some visual similarities to the Pontiac GTO and Oldsmobile Cutlass. Called the G610, it came with a stretched front end to accommodate the longer engine and featured a different grill and other aesthetic modifications. This model was not available as a wagon. The most powerful GTX-E received fuel injection and .

The 610 Bluebird received a facelift in 1974, with prominent turn signals mounted on the front corners and with a more squared off grille as well as new taillamps. The SSS models now had styled steel wheels without hubcaps. New equipment such as a remote trunk opener, interval wipers, a central handbrake (rather than the earlier &quot;umbrella style&quot; one), and new interior materials accompanied the external changes, while the engines were now capable of meeting the most recent emissions regulations, marketed as Nissan NAPS. This means that the 610 was available with three different front ends: original, facelift, and the &quot;shark-nose&quot; six-cylinder front. A minor upgrade to the front suspension (offset strut tops) for the 610 led to slightly improved handling before the introduction of the 810.

;Australia
In Australia, Datsun released the locally produced 180B in October 1972 as a four-door sedan in Deluxe and GL trims, and a two-door SSS coupe. The engine fitted was the 1.8-litre &quot;L18&quot; engine paired to a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission; Datsun upgraded the SSS to a five-speed manual in 1975. Over the base Deluxe, GL models added: vinyl roof, radio with separate speaker, upgraded interior upholstery and trim, cut-pile interior carpeting, chrome exhaust extension, rear mounted GL badge, and whitewall tyres. In early 1974, wrap-around front indicators, new tail-lights and cabin trim changes heralded a range-wide facelift, while a fully imported (not locally manufactured) luxury GX sedan arrived in November 1974.
The GX model could only be differentiated on the exterior by its grille, wipers and badges, although the interior gained luxuries such as cloth inserts for the vinyl upholstery and a three-way adjustable driving seat (fore/aft, recline, thigh support). A GX wagon followed in June 1975, followed by a minor trim and grille facelift in 1976. The 180B proved popular right to its discontinuation in October 1977, when the P810 200B range arrived in Australia.

;North America
In the United States and Canada, the car was sold simply as the &quot;Datsun 610&quot;. The four-door sedans, a two-door hardtop coupé, and a five-door station wagon were available, and were marketed as a more luxurious and larger product than the 510. For 1973 and 1974, North America was the only market outside Japan to have its 610 HT models equipped with the unique, six-bulb tail lights that covered the entire rear panel, requiring the license plate to be mounted below the rear bumper. The car originally received criticisms for elevated noise levels and engine drivability problems; Nissan responded with engine improvements during 1973 and a new engine for 1974, mounted on new engine mounts to lower noise and vibration. The window seals were also modified, to lower wind noise.

While the original Datsun 610 had a 1770 cc L18 engine, 1974–1976 610s received the larger 2.0-litre L20B engine (as did the Datsun 710 from 1975), although with only (SAE Net). The federalized 2.0 thus produced less than what was claimed for a Japanese market 1.6. California-spec cars have . The federal/Canadian version took leaded fuel and depended on an EGR system for pollution control, while the California cars have a catalytic converter and require unleaded petrol, using technology labeled in Japan as Nissan NAPS. Gross horsepower ratings are 110 and 107 respectively. The 1974s also received larger bumpers mounted on hydraulic cylinders to meet new safety standards, increasing weight by about and making the car longer. The additional weight meant performance still suffered moderately (while fuel consumption dropped by about ten percent) from the higher weight and additional emissions equipment.

Until the 1977 introduction of the six-cylinder 810, the 610 was Datsun&#x27;s largest car sold in North America.

;New Zealand
New Zealand market cars initially were a single 1.8-litre 180B sedan, again with four-speed manual transmission and assembled from CKD kits under contract by Campbell&#x27;s. A three-speed automatic – using a transmission made by Nissan Japan subsidiary JATCO – was later added as a factory option. Relaxed restrictions on car assembly kit imports and increasing affluence in NZ meant Campbell&#x27;s, which also assembled Toyota, Renault, Rambler, Hino, Isuzu and Peugeot models over the years, could not meet demand so Nissan-Datsun (NZ) contracted Chrysler/Mitsubishi importer Todd Motors to assemble additional manual 180Bs at its Porirua factory alongside the Chrysler Valiant, Hunter, Avenger and Alpine model ranges and Mitsubishi Lancer sedan and Colt Galant coupe. The Todd-built cars gave Datsun dealers a new range of paint colours all different from those Campbell&#x27;s offered.

=== Racing history ===
610 Bluebird four-doors participated in the 1972 and 1973 East African Safari Rallies as the &quot;Datsun 1800 SSS&quot;. In 1973, 610s placed second and fourth overall, behind the overall winning Datsun 240Z. Bob Sharp drove his 610 HT race car to second place overall in the American SCCA B Sedan Championship for 1973 and 1974. The same car achieved a first place for the 1976 SCCA B-Sedan Championship but with Elliot Forbes-Robinson driving.
=== 710 series ===

Shortly after the introduction of the 610, Nissan launched a new line of slightly smaller cars January 1973 utilizing parts and styling cues from the 610. This new line of cars was sold in various markets as the Datsun 140J/160J, Datsun Violet, or Datsun 710. In Japan, it was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; Japanese dealerships as a larger companion to the smaller Nissan Cherry, thereby giving Nissan the opportunity to sell a Bluebird-sized vehicle at a different sales channel. The use of the 710 name was a source of confusion because it implied that the model was either a larger, upscale version of the 610 (it was the opposite) or a newer model in the Bluebird line. This car was built at various international plants and was marketed under different names as local conditions required. As the Bluebirds traditional cross-town rival, the Toyota Corona split into a new model called the Toyota Carina, the Violet appeared just under three years after the Carina did.


== 810 series ==
The 810 was introduced in July 1976. Engine options were largely carried over, with all petrol engines offered in Japan meeting the 1976 emissions requirements thanks to Nissan&#x27;s NAPS system. Styling was an evolution of the 610s, with slightly squared off features but retaining a slight &quot;coke bottle&quot; shape. No two-door sedan was available, but the four-door sedan, two-door hardtop coupé (SSS Coupé) and five-door station wagon were offered. As usual, the wagon was mainly sold as a &quot;light van&quot; in Japan, meaning that it was engineered with cargo in mind and had a live, leaf-sprung rear axle rather than the independent rear suspension of the saloons and coupés.

The Bluebird 810 was sold in export markets as the Datsun 160B/180B/200B and as the Datsun 810. Australian magazine &quot;Wheels&quot; called the 200B &#x27;a 180B with 20 more mistakes.&#x27; The heavy-looking and rather outdated 810 did not sell very well and Nissan responded by accelerating work on the next generation Bluebird (910), leaving the 810 in production for only three years and four months.

In Japan the range gradually received upgraded motors which could pass the 1978 emissions standards; these models carry 811 series chassis numbers. Japanese market 811-series vehicles replaced the Bluebird badge on the rear decklid with a NAPS badge, identifying emission control technology as having been installed. The process of meeting the 1978 standards began in October 1977 and continued until August 1978 and meant replacing the earlier L-series engines with the new crossflow Z engines, based on the L. From March 1979 until the end of production in November that year, the NAPS badge was once again removed from passenger cars (although taxis featured a &quot;NAPS-Z&quot; badge as they were now equipped with the new Z engine).

In Japan there continued to be a six-cylinder version of the Bluebird available. As before, this received a longer wheelbase and nose, while retaining the rear end of the regular Bluebird range. The Bluebird G6 used a carburetor for the base model and fuel injection for the sporty version. The 2.0 L engine was good for JIS depending on fuel feed. In August 1978 the Bluebird G4 was introduced (PD811), a 1.8-litre four-cylinder model fitted with the long-nose bodywork.

=== Europe (160B/180B) ===
At this time, with several UK auto-producers such as British Leyland losing market share, Datsun had grabbed the headlines as the UK&#x27;s leading car importer. The magazine &quot;Autocar&quot; road tested a 180B Bluebird and recorded a top speed of along with a 0–60 mph (0 – 97 km/h) time of 13.6 seconds. The Datsun&#x27;s overall fuel consumption for the test was 27.7 mpg (10.2 L/100 km). For all three of these performance measurements, it was marginally better than the Ford Cortina 1600 GL which continued to dominate this sector in the UK, but both cars were beaten for speed and acceleration (though not for fuel economy) by the relatively crude Morris Marina 1.8HL. It was probably more significant that the Bluebird had a manufacturer&#x27;s recommended retail price, including sales taxes, of £2950 as against £3263 for the Ford and £3315 for the Morris. The testers found the car matched the competition in most respects, though the brakes were criticised for being &quot;not up to current standards&quot;.

In Europe, the 160B claimed , while the larger-engined 180B had to offer. The sporting SSS model had to make do with a very modest power increase; two more horsepower for .

=== Australia (200B) ===
Introduced in October 1977 in Australia, the first 200Bs were all fully imported in sedan, station wagon and coupe forms, the latter retaining the SSS badge. In January 1978 local assembly began for the sedan, followed shortly by the wagon. The sedan trim levels were GL and GX. While the coupe remained a hardtop, Datsun added an opera window in the rear pillar. The coupe was discontinued in Australia in 1979. The engine used is a larger version of the L series engine from the preceding 180B. Dubbed the L20B its capacity was increased to 1952 cc, making it good for .

Almost immediately the 200B became Australia&#x27;s top selling four-cylinder car, a position it held until it was displaced by the Mitsubishi Sigma. Its popularity however remained strong right through the production run, family buyers appreciative of the plentiful interior room and standard features. It may have been somewhat conservatively styled, but the effort Nissan had put into the engineering of the car made it reliable and tough, qualities most Australians rated higher than a more advanced design.

Only the early fully imported 200B sedans and coupés retained the independent rear suspension from the 180B, locally assembled 200B sedans instead switched to coil springs with a live axle, while the wagon (imported from Japan) had a live axle in the rear with leaf springs. Seen as a giant step backwards, the reason for the change was certainly not a cost-cutting measure, but simply the need for Nissan to reach an 85% local content quota that the then Federal Government demanded of Australian car manufacturers. However, in practice the live rear axle, being an Australian development, proved to actually benefit the car&#x27;s overall handling dynamics. The 2-litre overhead cam engine could be loud at high revs, and there were drive line vibration issues. A correction programme was instituted by the parent company in Japan.

A sportier version of the 200B sedan was released in June 1978. The new SX featured a revised grille, front spoiler, alloy wheels, revised door and seat trim (striped seat inserts) and tachometer, while the suspension was altered to improve handling. The colours available for this model were simply blue, white or red, and the only transmission available was a 4-speed floor shift. Significantly the SX was a unique model to Australia, the added input from Nissan&#x27;s Australian design engineers signified a step away from just assembling cars. This in turn led to the locally built Datsuns, and later Nissans, being re-engineered to better suit Australian conditions, with many components being sourced locally – a tradition that would continue right up until 1992, when Nissan ceased local manufacture.

In October 1979, the 200B was revised with a new grille, bumpers, seats, trim, and dashboard. The seats were a unique Australian design for the locally built cars. This facelift was penned by Paul Beranger, a former Holden designer – years later he would style the 2006 Toyota Aurion.

In 1980, a limited edition 200B Aspen GL sedan was released featuring distinctive shadow tone paint available in green, blue, or grey. The 200B was discontinued in May 1981, replaced by the Datsun Bluebird. Australian comedy band, Tripod, have written a song about the 200B, called &quot;200B.&quot;

=== New Zealand (160B/180B/200B) ===
This model was also released to New Zealand in 1977, assembled CKD in 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon forms. A coupe model was also released, imported built-up from Japan. Unlike the Australian models the sedans used the independent rear suspension system of the Japanese specification models. This Bluebird was the first to be assembled in Nissan New Zealand&#x27;s own brand-new assembly plant at Wiri, South Auckland. For the first two years of assembly the cars were fitted with a 1.8-litre unit, hence they used the &quot;180B&quot; nameplate. Automatic transmission was optional for both. Nissan also added its first luxury ZX version with this generation – features included velour upholstery, &#x27;luxury&#x27; cut-pile carpet sourced locally and tinted glass. There was also, for the first time in Kiwi assembly, a wagon variant with mid-range trim and equipment.

During 1979 a number of changes were made on the car, namely an engine enlargement to 2.0 (leading to a renaming of the car to &quot;200B&quot;), and a mild facelift, using new dual rectangular headlights and a new grille. Due to New Zealand&#x27;s favour for smaller-engined models, a 1.6-litre &quot;160B&quot; variant was also introduced.

Production of the New Zealand 160/200B continued until late 1980, when it was replaced by the Datsun Bluebird (910).

=== North America (810) ===
In North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the Datsun 810 from February 1977 to 1980—the direct ancestor of the long running Datsun/Nissan Maxima range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by two versions of the SOHC &quot;L-series&quot; I6 engine: a 2.0 L displacement for the Japanese market and the 2.4-litre L24E unit for the US market. The bigger American engine could reach SAE. The Sport version channeled power through a four-speed manual transmission for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were rear-wheel drive and had a semi-trailing arm rear suspension. The six-cylinder station wagon variant, only sold in North America, had a rear live axle to handle extra weight. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.

The two-door coupé version was introduced in North America in January 1979 for the 1979 model year. Around the same time, the 810 received an exterior refresh. The coupé version was never available in second generation 810/Maximas. The new Datsun 280ZX did not share much of the 810&#x27;s chassis as thought, though the 810 was not available with that Z car&#x27;s larger 2.8 L engine. The first use of the &quot;Maxima&quot; name happened on a domestic Japanese market luxury version of the Stanza, in August 1977.
== 910 series ==


The Bluebird 910, the last of the rear-wheel drive Bluebirds, featured simple clean-cut lines, unlike the &quot;Coke Bottle&quot; styling of its predecessor. It did however retain the same engine range, the same MacPherson strut suspension and the same wheelbase as the 810. Starting with this generation, in Japan the Bluebird returned to offering only four-cylinder vehicles, and the six-cylinder Bluebird was replaced by the Nissan Skyline based Nissan Leopard at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; Japanese dealerships. Bluebirds of this generation were renowned for reliability but rusted away in salted areas long before the engine gave trouble. Nissan realigned with the Japanese Stanza/Auster/Violet sedans which were assigned to individual Japanese Nissan dealerships.

This car was also assembled in Australia, in South Africa, in Taiwan, and in New Zealand. This generation was also the basis of the North American Datsun/Nissan 810 Maxima from 1980 onwards.

In Europe, the Bluebird was joined in 1981 by the similar-sized Stanza, which gave Nissan buyers the alternative option of front-wheel drive and a hatchback body style for the first time, as front-wheel drive hatchbacks were by now overtaking rear-wheel drive saloons in popularity.
== U11 series ==
The Bluebird was modified to front-wheel drive in October 1983, but retained the boxy styling of its predecessor. At the time, Nissan&#x27;s design chief believed this method of styling would remain popular. Even though every panel was changed and most details were considerably smoother, the drag coefficient remained a fairly high 0.39.

The range was offered in four-door sedan, four-door hardtop, and five-door station wagon forms. The coupé was deleted, and the hardtop sedan is rarely seen outside Japan.

This model was offered in Europe for only two years before Nissan began building the Auster as the Bluebird at its newly opened plant in the UK in 1986. Certain Bluebird models (diesels and station wagons) continued to be offered alongside the T12 &quot;Bluebird&quot; in some markets. As usual, the Bluebird received ample standard equipment in European markets. In some markets, the petrol 2.0 was only available coupled to an automatic gearbox.

Although the U11 sedans were replaced for the 1988 model year, the station wagon continued to be built until 1990. The six-cylinder Maxima also continued to be built (without the &quot;Bluebird&quot; portion of the name from May 1987) until October 1988, when an all-new Maxima appeared. Most of the wagons sold in Japan were to commercial vehicle specifications, but a plusher Wagon was also offered. The &quot;Bluebird Wagon SSS Turbo Wingroad&quot; had a 1.8-litre inline-four. It was the first car to receive the &quot;Wingroad&quot; name, in September 1987. The wagons/vans were built until May 1990, when they were replaced by the Nissan Avenir (Primera wagon in most export markets).

The range was available with 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 L petrol engines, with the 1.8-litre four available with an optional turbocharger. The VG20ET V6 was offered for the first time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the Bluebird Maxima. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0 L VG30E. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better gas mileage in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed – as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.
Australia continued with the 910 series, which was facelifted in 1985. New Zealand marketing for the U11 proclaimed the vehicle as the &#x27;Widetrack Bluebird&#x27;, to differentiate it from its very similar-looking predecessor. Several Wiri-assembled models including a wagon were offered with 1.6 (base) or two-litre carburettor engines. The alloy head castings all had an unused location for a second spark plug per cylinder, as twin-plug, fuel-injected versions of the same engines were used in certain markets (US, Japan, Scandinavia) with stricter emission laws.

In the United Kingdom, the following versions were offered:
* 1.8 DX (1984–86)
* 2.0 GL/GL estate/SGL (1984–86)
* 1.8 Turbo ZX (1984–86)
The U11 was sold as the &quot;Yue Loong Bluebird 921 / 923 &quot; in Taiwan.
== T12/T72 series ==

The T12 and the later T72 Nissan Bluebird, is a third-generation Auster, rebadged and sold in Europe. The T12 was introduced in Europe in 1985 as a replacement for the U11 Bluebird. From July 1986, the T12 was assembled from parts shipped in from Japan, at Washington, England. The saloon versions (four-door) were available first and the hatchback (five-door) became available in January 1987.

== U12 series ==
Nissan replaced the boxy U11 in September 1987 with the U12 series, offered in four-door sedan and four-door hardtop body types. It was designed to have a rounded appearance in comparison to the previous generation. The hardtop sedan was later fitted with a centre &quot;B&quot; pillar structure to increase body stiffness. The top level car was the V6 VG20ET &quot;Bluebird Maxima&quot; station wagon from the previous generation U11 series and was still in production at the introduction of this generation.

The various grade configurations included the traditional &quot;SSS&quot; (SSS / twincam SSS / twincam SSS-X). In addition to the SSS series, the Bluebird wagon was replaced by the Nissan Avenir, and the sedans (LE / SE Saloon / XE Sedan / Super-select) were also available. The entry level 1600LE (five-speed manual transmission) started out at ¥1,198,000 to the top level Twin Cam Turbo 1800 cc offered on the SSS Attesa Limited (four-speed automatic) starting at ¥2,998,000 in sedan, and Hard Top bodystyles and boasted a wide variety of equipment and different combinations and grades. At the time of introduction, there was also the limited production SSS-R model, with lowered weight and a special high-power engine as well as oversized extra headlamps and racing livery.
Innovations for the U12 included the introduction of Nissan&#x27;s mechanical four-wheel-drive system, called ATTESA and the ever-popular SR20DET engine which was introduced in the series 2 (HNU12) bluebirds (1989–1991). With the Maxima having been spun off into its own range, U12 Bluebirds were all four-cylinder models, with either a 1.6-, 1.8-, or 2.0-litre petrol engine and also the option of the LD20 2.0-litre diesel. The sports and luxury versions came with a factory viscous LSD. Nissan made a turbocharged Bluebird from 1987 to 1990 named the RNU12, using the 1809 cc DOHC CA18DET that was sold in Japan and New Zealand. It, too used the ATTESA system.

In October 1989 the U12 Bluebird was facelifted, receiving new rear lamps and other minor external changes. More importantly, the 1.8-litre engines were switched from the somewhat noisy old CA family to the new SR engines displacing 1.8 or 2.0 litres. The base 1.6 engine remained the carburetted CA16S. There was only a single 1.8, the single-point injected SR18Di with , a significant increase over the CA18i. This was also available with the ATTESA system, in either XE or SE trim. Beginning in November 1990, Nissan managed to fit an FE ATTESA trim level between the two existing ones.
In May 1991 the &quot;Bluebird Aussie&quot; went on sale, a rebadged Pintara Superhatch (see below for Australian production). It only remained on sale until the next generation Bluebird was introduced in August 1991, and so only 1,300 of these cars were sold in Japan. Unlike Australian-market cars, the Bluebird Aussie came equipped with a Japanese-spec SR20DE engine.

===Export markets===
The U12 was also sold in North America as the Nissan Stanza.

;Australia and New Zealand
This model was sold as the Nissan Pintara in Australia, replacing a larger Skyline-based model, from 1989 to 1993. There, it had been codenamed ‘Project Matilda’, leading the press to speculate it was a car developed uniquely for Australia — which was not the case. In Japan, a four-door sedan and four-door hardtop were offered, although Nissan of Australia did create a five-door Pintara &#x27;Superhatch&#x27; model that was sold as the Bluebird in some export markets, including New Zealand. It was marketed as the &#x27;Bluebird Aussie&#x27; in Japan, selling complete with a fluffy little koala, an Australian flag under the clock and other small touches.

Australian models came with the CA20E SOHC 2.0l EFI and KA24E SOHC 2.4l EFI motors. Sadly for Nissan Australia, Project Matilda was not the success it had hoped, even with a twin built for Ford Australia called the Corsair, which was even less successful. This led to the collapse of Nissan’s Australian manufacturing operations in the early 1990s. Most of the early Bluebirds of this generation sold in New Zealand were again assembled locally from CKD kits, as had been the case with almost all NZ-bound cars since the first generation in the early 1960s. The Japanese-made, NZ-assembled cars were replaced by Australian made U12 sedans at &#x27;facelift&#x27; time though the Kiwi-built U11 wagon, a body variant not made in Australia, carried on. NZ trim levels included SGS and ZX; like rival Toyota Australia, Nissan Australia, which ceased local manufacturing in 1994, was willing to build uniquely specified and badged models for its trans-Tasman customer.

Trim levels of the Australian U12 Pintara were as follows:
*GLi: 2.0 L manual 5 speed, high mounted brake light, AM/FM radio cassette
*Executive: 2.0 L auto 4-speed, as above plus, power steering, remote boot release
*T: 2.4 L manual or auto, as above plus 4-wheel disc brakes, tacho, split fold rear seat
*Ti: 2.4 L manual or auto, as above plus limited slip differential, cruise control, climate control, central locking, electric windows, graphic equaliser, fog lamps, alloy wheels
*TRX: 2.4 L manual or auto, as above plus sports seats, sports suspension, body kit, alarm, 6Jx14&quot; alloy wheels (all other models have 5.5Jx14&quot; wheels)

All models were available as a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatch, except the TRX, which was only available as a 4-door sedan. The Ford Corsair was available as a GL (CA20 engine) and Ghia (KA24, similar features as the Ti).

;Malaysia
Local assemblers Tan Chong were losing the low-cost market to local upstart Proton in the mid-1980s (by 1986, Nissan sales in Malaysia were down 90 percent from their peak a few years earlier). To revive their fortunes, Tan Chong attempted to reposition the brand as &quot;upmarket standard,&quot; taking on brands such as Honda. As a result, the U12 Bluebird was priced much higher than the preceding generation, and was also available with more equipment and in a more powerful, fuel injected 2-litre Super Select model. The 1974 cc CA20E engine produces at 5600 rpm. There was also a carburetted 1.8 SE model available, equipped with the CA18NS engine.

;Chile
In Chile the U12 Bluebird only arrived in 1990, as the U11 generation had remained available until then. It was available with the carburetted CA18NS or 2-litre CA20S with SE Saloon equipment, as well as the same fuel injected CA20E engine for the Super Select as used in Malaysia and other markets with minimal emissions regulations. Outputs are . A five-speed manual was standard, with a three-speed automatic available in the 1.8 and a four-speed auto for the 2-litre models.


== U13 series ==

The U13 series was launched in Japan in September 1991 as a four-door sedan and four-door pillared hardtop. The two models were visually distinct: the four-door sedan had curves where its U12 predecessor had edges, while the hardtop, called the Nissan Bluebird ARX, had more traditional styling. The Bluebird wagon was replaced by the new Nissan Avenir. This series replaced the Stanza/Auster/Violet platform expansion that enabled Nissan to sell a Bluebird-sized product at Nissan&#x27;s Japanese dealership network, as the economic effects of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble began to unfold in Japan. Projected production for 1992 was 15,000 cars per month, 13,000 of which were intended for the Japanese domestic market.

The new Bluebird was designed with comfort in mind. The more spacious cabin was the result of a longer wheelbase and a slightly taller design, in a package retaining the length and width of the previous model. Another piece of equipment for comfort was the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) system available in domestic market Hardtop models. This was the first installation of such a system, although its effect was limited and it was to be another twenty years before it reached wider adoption.

Several Japanese models included an All Wheel Drive version (ATTESA). The engines used in the Japanese models ranged greatly in capacity and type. The SSS Attesa LTD model used a &quot;redtop&quot; SR20DET with . This was a similar engine/drivetrain package to the more powerful one used in the Pulsar GTi-R. It had only a single throttle body as opposed the GTi-R&#x27;s multiple throttle body, smaller bearings, hydraulic rather than solid lifters, and a smaller turbo. The GTi-R had a large top mount intercooler, while the SSS ATTESA LTD had a smaller front mount intercooler. The Bluebird SSS was set apart from the North American Altima in that not only having the SR20DET and AWD Attesa as an option, it also had other details such as power folding retracting mirrors (some heated) and a rear wiper if equipped with a spoiler. US cars are also larger due to the fitment of bigger bumpers.

===Export markets===
The Australian delivered U13 Bluebird was released in late 1993 and terminated in 1997. Series 1 ran from 1993 until 1995 while Series 2 ran from 1995 to 1997. Series 2 saw the addition of a driver&#x27;s airbag, revised grille styling, and a seat belt warning light. The Series 1 LX model came equipped with cruise control standard but strangely it was an option on the Series 2.

The Australian U13 Bluebirds were available in three different models, LX—the base model but very well equipped, Ti—the luxury model, and the SSS—the sports model. Compared to the LX, the Ti had climate control, a sunroof, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). while comparing the LX to the SSS, the SSS had a HUD (heads-up display—digital speedo on windscreen), climate control, fog lights, ski-port, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). Despite there being a sports model (SSS), the LX was the fastest of the Australian models due to having the least weight. The engine used in the Australian and US U13 models was the KA24DE with and 210 Nm of torque).

The U13 Bluebird was introduced in New Zealand in early 1993, and was produced at Nissan&#x27;s assembly plant in South Auckland from CKD packs imported from Japan until 1997, when it was replaced by the Primera. The model received much praise for its handling roadholding, with some models benefitting from the Attesa&#x27;s passively steered rear wheels. New Zealand models were; S (base model, not available until later), SE (mid-spec), SES (sport) and SEL (luxury). Several versions of the sedan, including the first local Bluebird to have standard factory-fitted air conditioning (automatic climate control in this case) and optional locally supplied leather upholstery. At launch, some local motoring writers criticised Nissan NZ&#x27;s decision to fit luxury equipment items instead of airbags in top versions but the company insisted there was not yet sufficient retail or fleet buyer demand.

The US-built U13 (Nissan Altima) was released in 1993 and was similar to the Australian U13.

===EQ7200 series===
Nissan Motor signed an agreement with Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd. of China, to build the Bluebird there in the early 2000s. It was the U13 model that was chosen, and is sold there as the Fengshen(Aeolus) Bluebird.

Yulon Motor, the Taiwan-based automaker, developed this variant of the U13, called the EQ7200-II series, in 2001. This featured a U13 central section but heavily revised front and rear ends with tail lamps and trunk lid design derived from the L30 Altima. However, the centre of the car remains the same, and the wheelbase is retained.

The EQ7200-I ,which basically kept the look and specs of facelifted Bluebird U13 SSS, commenced production in 1999 and lasted until 2002 being replaced by the EQ7200-II. The EQ7200-II was built from 2001 to 2003, when it was replaced by a revised EQ7200-III model. The EQ7200-III was sold from 2003 to 2007.

The car is marginally longer at , as opposed to the original U13&#x27;s . These Chinese models used a Chinese built SR20DE called EQ486.

== U14 series ==
Nissan switched to boxy styling for the final U14 Bluebird for January 1996. The American Altima developed into a completely separate line of cars, with new L-series chassis codes. But in its home market of Japan – also the only market it was sold new in – the Bluebird was targeted more at buyers who favoured the formality of larger Japanese sedans. To fit in with a lower bracket in Japanese taxation legislation, the U14 retained a sub- width.

Only a four-door sedan was offered. The hardtop and the option of a 1.6 L engine were removed. Engine choices were either the SR18DE, SR20DE, and the SR20VE, with available all-wheel-drive (ATTESA) versions. The Nissan Hyper CVT automatic transmission was available in this generation along with a standard four-speed automatic, five-speed manual. Some models had a 1973 cc diesel CD20E engine. Models offered include the standard LeGrand, luxury Eprise, sports-oriented SSS, and a limited run SSS-Z model. The SSS-Z model came with the variable valve lift-equipped, SR20VE engine and featured special interior trim which was silver rather than the wood trim found on Legrand, Eprise, and SSS models.

In 2001, a final limited run of SSS models was produced. These cars have a special red and grey paint job, gold rather than the standard silver emblems, and red metal covers over the headlights.

Production of the Nissan Bluebird ended in Japan in 2001, and it was replaced by the mid-size Nissan Maxima, Nissan Teana, and Nissan Altima internationally, and the compact Nissan Bluebird Sylphy in Japan. It has been a popular used export to Russia, Africa, some parts of the Caribbean, and New Zealand.

<text>Patricia Marwick (née Lee; born 5 November 1953) is a Scottish politician who served as Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2011 to 2016. She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2016. Elected as a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she suspended her membership in 2011 upon her election as presiding officer, following the tradition of the presiding officer being nonpartisan.

Born in Cowdenbeath and raised in Fife, she worked for Shelter Scotland before becoming a politician. In the first ever Scottish Parliament election, Marwick ran as an SNP candidate for the Central Fife constituency, but came second to Henry McLeish. Although she failed to win the seat in two elections, she was elected as an additional member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, she defeated Scottish Labour&#x27;s Christine May, and was elected to serve as the MSP for Central Fife.

Following the 2011 election to the 4th Scottish Parliament, Marwick was elected to the newly drawn Mid Fife and Glenrothes constituency. With the SNP&#x27;s outright majority, she was elected as the fourth Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. Marwick is the first woman to hold the position of office. As the Presiding Officer is a non-partisan role, she was forced to relinquish her party affiliation. She stood down from the Scottish Parliament in the 2016 election and the from 2016 to 2020, she served as chair of the NHS Fife board.

==Early life and career==
Patricia Lee was born on 5 November 1953 in Cowdenbeath and was brought up in Fife, one of seven siblings. She worked as Public Affairs Officer for Shelter Scotland, a charity for homeless people, from 1992 to 1999.

== Member of the Scottish Parliament ==

At the 1999 Scottish Parliamentary election, Marwick was elected as a member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region. She served on the SNP opposition frontbench team as Deputy Business Manager (1999–2000), Shadow Minister for Local Government (2004), Business Manager and Chief Whip (2004–2005) and Shadow Minister for Housing (2005–2007). Marwick served as a member of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Standards, Justice and Home Affairs, Equal Opportunities, Local Government and Communities committees and as convenor of the Waverly Railway (Scotland) Bill committee (2004–06).

At the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary election she contested the Central Fife seat and, although she narrowly failed to win the seat, she was re-elected to serve as a member for Mid Scotland and Fife. Marwick contested Central Fife again in 2007 and was elected as the constituencies MSP after defeating the Labour incumbent, Christine May, with a majority of 1,166 votes.

Following the 2007 election Marwick was appointed as the SNP&#x27;s representative on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, and oversaw parliamentary access and information issues.

==Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament==
In the 2011 election, Marwick was elected for the Mid Fife and Glenrothes constituency, essentially a redrawing of her old Central Fife seat. On 11 May 2011, when Parliament reconvened, Marwick was elected to serve as the 4th Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, having won support from the majority of members in the second round of voting. She became the first woman and second SNP member to serve in the position. In October 2012, Marwick accepted a nomination to join the Privy Council, meaning that she is styled the Rt Hon. Tricia Marwick MSP.

On 29 May 2015, it was announced that Marwick would stand down as Presiding Officer at the 2016 election. She also left elected politics as a whole. Upon standing down, she was made an offer to have her name put forward for an honour from the Queen but turned the offer down.

==After Parliament==
Marwick was announced as the new chair for the NHS Fife board in November 2016, replacing Allan Burns who resigned from the post in August 2016. Her appointment as chair ran from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2020.

In 2021 Marwick tweeted journalist Fraser Nelson, who had published articles critical of the Scottish Government, that, &quot;We see you Fraser. We see what you are trying to do. Have never seen you challenge Westminster Governments. Scottish birth not alone does a Scotsman make, sometimes it signifies a Scotsman on the make.&quot; Nelson replied, “While raised in the Highlands I guess I was never quite properly Scottish. How could you tell?” The Scottish Conservatives said Marwick &quot;should clearly have known better than to pander to the most extreme wing of her party&quot; and she deleted the tweet.

In 2022 a student newspaper at St Andrew&#x27;s University ran a satirical article in which it criticised Nicola Sturgeon as &quot;too scary&quot; for Hell and suggested that England “boot Scotland out of the union”. Marwick denounced St Andrew&#x27;s as “not a Fife university” and described students as “pathetic wee trolls”. “I regret the Saint run by the University of St Andrews students just buys into every stereotype we Fifers have of them,&quot; she tweeted. “Poor souls who failed to get into Oxbridge display every prejudice; anti Scottish and anti women.” Local MSP Willie Rennie and MP Wendy Chamberlain said: “It was one article, published by one student out of several thousand students and staff at St Andrews. It does not represent the views of staff and students. It was therefore wholly unacceptable for the chair of NHS Fife to trash the whole university with offensive remarks too.” Marwick later deleted the tweet.

== Personal life ==
Marwick&#x27;s niece is Natalie McGarry, the former MP for Glasgow East.

The Duchy of Berry, centred on Bourges, was originally created as an appanage for junior members of the French royal family and was frequently granted to female royals. The style &quot;Duke of Berry&quot; was later granted by several Bourbon monarchs to their grandsons. The last official Duke of Berry was Charles Ferdinand of Artois, son of Charles X. The title Duke of Berry is currently being claimed through its usage as a courtesy title by Prince Alphonse de Bourbon, son of Prince Louis, Duke of Anjou, the Legitimist claimant to the French Throne.

On October 1360, King John II created the peerage-duchy of Berry as an appanage for his third-born son, John of Poitiers, perhaps on the occasion of his marriage with Joan of Armagnac. Upon his death in 1416, John of Poitiers was succeeded as Duke of Berry by his grandnephew John, Dauphin of France (having been predeceased in 1397 by his only son who survived into adulthood, John, Count of Montpensier). After Dauphin John&#x27;s death in 1417, the appanage passed to his younger brother the Dauphin Charles. The Dauphin subsequently moved his court to Berry&#x27;s capital of Bourges to escape the advancing English during the Hundred Years’ War. When the Dauphin ascended to the throne as Charles VII, Berry returned to the royal domain.

In 1461, Louis XI granted Berry to his younger brother, Charles. Charles maintained a rivalry with his brother and joined the League of the Public Weal, an anti-royal alliance of French magantes led by the Count of Charolais. After a short war against Louis XI which was concluded with the Treaty of Conflans in 1465, Charles gained the Duchy of Normandy (which he later exchanged for the Duchy of Guyenne in 1469). Charles died without legitimate issue in 1472 due to syphilis, although some believed he was a victim of poisoning. With no male heir, the title reverted to the Crown once again.

In 1498, Louis XII granted Berry to his former wife Joan of France, daughter of Louis XI, as compensation for their marriage&#x27;s annulment. She was the first &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess, and after her death without issue Berry returned to the Crown.

==House of Valois-Angoulême (1527-1601)==
In 1527, King Francis I granted his sister Marguerite the duchy of Berry, probably on the occasion of her marriage to Henry II of Navarre. After her death without male issue in 1549, Berry reverted to the Crown.

In 1550, King Henry II granted Berry to his sister Margaret of Valois for life. After the death of Margaret of Valois in 1574, her nephew King Henry III granted Berry and the County of La Marche to his sister-in-law and Queen dowager of France Elisabeth of Austria. However, in 1577, as a consequence of the Peace of Monsieur, Elisabeth of Austria was forced by King Henry III to exchange Berry and La Marche (which then became part of the expanded appanage of his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou) for the duchies of Auvergne and Bourbon. After Francis of Anjou&#x27;s death in 1584, Berry and his other appanages again returned to the Crown.

In 1589, King Henry IV granted Berry to King Henry III&#x27;s widow Louise of Lorraine for her lifetime.

== House of Bourbon (1686-1820)==
In 1686, King Louis XIV granted the title Duke of Berry to his third grandson Charles who continued to use it as his primary title until his death in 1714, despite never gaining the appanage of Berry. In 1754, King Louis XV styled his newborn grandson Louis-Auguste as Duke of Berry until his ascension as Dauphin of France in 1765, after his father&#x27;s death.

In 1778, King Louis XVI re-established the Duchy of Berry as an appanage for his newborn nephew, Charles Ferdinand of Artois, who was killed in 1820 by Louis Pierre Louvel, a Bonapartist.

<text>James Stuart Mather (born 6 March 1947) is a former Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He was the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism from 2007 to 2011 and a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 2003 to 2011. Mather was the SNP&#x27;s treasurer for four years. Since leaving parliament he has held various non-executive posts and academic roles.

==Early life==
Mather was born in Lochwinnoch and was educated at Paisley Grammar School and Greenock High School before attending the University of Glasgow. Prior to his election to Holyrood he worked as a chartered accountant and ran his own business.

==Political career==
He joined the SNP in 1996 and was the SNP&#x27;s National Treasurer from 2000.

He is credited with making and presenting the economic case for Scottish Independence, having taken the argument to the media, boardrooms and committee rooms across Scotland between 2001 and 2007.

He was the SNP candidate in the 2000 Ayr by-election and was their candidate for Argyll and Bute at the 2003 election. That latter election saw him elected to the Scottish Parliament as a regional list member for the Highlands and Islands. In opposition he was the SNP&#x27;s Shadow Enterprise and Economy Minister.

Mather contested Argyll and Bute again at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election and was successful, winning the seat from George Lyon of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.

After the SNP&#x27;s victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, Mather was appointed Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism and held that post for 4 years until the end of the 2011 parliament.

==After Parliament==
Jim Mather stood down as an MSP at the 2011 election.

In 2014, he chaired the Scottish Government&#x27;s Working Together Review, tasked with producing a report with recommendations that would facilitate the establishment of numerous progressive and collaborative workplaces in Scotland. That report was positively received and contributed to the establishment of a Cabinet position covering Fair Work and a Fair Work Convention.

In December 2014 he was announced as chairman of the trade body Homes for Scotland, formally taking up the three-year part-time position in May 2015. He stood down by mutual agreement on 12 May 2017.

Mather is currently a visiting professor with the University of Strathclyde and Heriot-Watt University and fulfils other consultancy and speaking roles.

<doc id="903983" wikidata="Q5065130" url="?curid=903983" title="Certification path validation algorithm">
<text>The certification path validation algorithm is the algorithm which verifies that a given certificate path is valid under a given public key infrastructure (PKI). A path starts with the Subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate that is not already explicitly trusted. For example, in a hierarchical PKI, a certificate chain starting with a web server certificate might lead to a small CA, then to an intermediate CA, then to a large CA whose trust anchor is present in the relying party&#x27;s web browser. In a bridged PKI, a certificate chain starting with a user at Company A might lead to Company A&#x27;s CA certificate, then to a bridge CA, then to company B&#x27;s CA certificate, then to company B&#x27;s trust anchor, which a relying party at company B could trust.

 defines a standardized path validation algorithm for X.509 certificates, given a certificate path. (Path discovery, the actual construction of a path, is not covered.) The algorithm takes the following inputs:
* The certificate path to be evaluated;
* The current date/time;
* The list of certificate policy object identifiers (OIDs) acceptable to the relying party (or any);
* The trust anchor of the certificate path; and
* Indicators whether policy mapping is allowed and how/when/whether the &quot;any&quot; policy OID is to be tolerated.

In the standardized algorithm, the following steps are performed for each certificate in the path, starting from the trust anchor. If any check fails on any certificate, the algorithm terminates and path validation fails. (This is an explanatory summary of the scope of the algorithm, not a rigorous reproduction of the detailed steps.)
* The public key algorithm and parameters are checked;
* The current date/time is checked against the validity period of the certificate;
* The revocation status is checked, whether by CRL, OCSP, or some other mechanism, to ensure the certificate is not revoked;
* The issuer name is checked to ensure that it equals the subject name of the previous certificate in the path;
* Name constraints are checked, to make sure the subject name is within the permitted subtrees list of all previous CA certificates and not within the excluded subtrees list of any previous CA certificate;
* The asserted certificate policy OIDs are checked against the permissible OIDs as of the previous certificate, including any policy mapping equivalencies asserted by the previous certificate;
* Policy constraints and basic constraints are checked, to ensure that any explicit policy requirements are not violated and that the certificate is a CA certificate, respectively. This step is crucial in preventing some man in the middle attacks;
* The path length is checked to ensure that it does not exceed any maximum path length asserted in this or a previous certificate;
* The key usage extension is checked to ensure that is allowed to sign certificates; and
* Any other critical extensions are recognized and processed.

If this procedure reaches the last certificate in the chain, with no name constraint or policy violations or any other error condition, then the certificate path validation algorithm terminates successfully.

<doc id="903985" wikidata="Q6674839" url="?curid=903985" title="Lonsdale Hundred">
<text>The Lonsdale Hundred is a historic hundred of Lancashire, England. Although named after the dale or valley of the River Lune, which runs through the city of Lancaster, for centuries it covered most of the north-western part of Lancashire around Morecambe Bay, including the detached parts of Furness and the Cartmel Peninsula. Ironically, only some of the detached part of North Lonsdale still remains partly within a British parliamentary constituency under the name of Lonsdale, being part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency.

Lonsdale was not recorded as a hundred in the Domesday Book of 1086, but the name does appear, in the returns for Yorkshire, apparently as a manor attached to Cockerham. A number of places within the Lune&#x27;s watershed are traditionally named with specification of &#x27;in Lonsdale&#x27;: Kirkby Lonsdale, Burton-in-Lonsdale, and Thornton-in-Lonsdale retain the name, while Middleton, Sedbergh, Ingleton and Newby, near Clapham have previously been recorded with it. Following the creation of the hundred sometime during the late 11th or early 12th centuries, parts of the district were included in Westmorland and others in Craven within the West Riding of Yorkshire. The hundred had been defined by 1168 and the bailiwick was granted to Adam de Kellet (of Nether Kellet) in 1199.

Other places in the Lonsdale hundred included Lancaster, Bolton-le-Sands, Barrow-in-Furness, Dalton-in-Furness, Ulverston, and Morecambe. The Furness Peninsula and the Cartmel Peninsula were known as &quot;Lonsdale North of the Sands&quot;, the major part of which later constituted (from 1894 to 1974) the North Lonsdale Rural District.

In 1831, the population of males over twenty years old was given as 10,707, meaning the total population would likely be over 20,000 during that year.

<doc id="903987" wikidata="Q2336499" url="?curid=903987" title="Higham, Kent">
<text>Higham is a village, civil parish and electoral ward in the borough of Gravesham in Kent, England. The village lies south-east of Gravesend and just north-west of Strood, in Medway. The civil parish had a population of 3,938 at the 2001 Census, increasing slightly to 3,962 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
A Roman grave and artifacts have been found at the north end of the village.

The priory dedicated to St. Mary was built on land granted to Mary, daughter of King Stephen. In 1148, the nuns of St Sulphice-la-Foret, Brittany, moved to Higham. Higham priory was also known as Lillechurch. On 6 July 1227, King Henry III confirmed the royal grant to the abbey of St. Mary and St. Sulpice of Lillechurch.

The original parish church, the Church of St Mary, was built in the 13th and 14th centuries and stands to the north of the present village, in the hamlet of Church Street. Redundant since the early 1980s, it is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, and is open to visitors on a daily basis. It contains much medieval woodwork and its pulpit is one of the oldest in Kent, dating from the 14th century. Charles Dickens&#x27; daughter Kate was married here in 1860.

The Higham Village History Group, founded in 1997, is devoted to assembling the history of the village.

==Parts of Higham==
Higham has developed as two parts, the original Saxon village of Higham to the north (now Lower Higham), and a more recent settlement to the south around the main road linking Gravesend to Rochester (Upper Higham), which grew in size and importance during the 1800s.

==Village facilities==

Services within the village are centred on the two parts of Higham.

Higham (upper) is the larger and is the site of a post office, a GP&#x27;s surgery, a library and several shops and pubs. It is also the location of the current parish church of St John&#x27;s, consecrated in 1862.

Higham (lower) is smaller. It originally had 4 pubs (all closed): The Sun Inn, The Chequers, The Railway Tavern and the Malt Shovel; a garage and Higham railway station. Until recently there was a Post Office and shop serving this area of the village. Church Street is a kilometre north of the station and is the location of the now redundant St Mary&#x27;s Church and a small number of houses. 

The village primary school (Higham County Primary), village hall (Higham Memorial Hall), park (Higham Recreation Ground) and tennis courts lie between the two parts of the village on School Lane. Until the 1990s the GP surgery serving the village was also based in this area.

==Points of interest==

===Gad&#x27;s Hill===

Gad&#x27;s Hill was once notorious as a haunt of robbers. As far back as 1558 there was a ballad entitled &quot;The Robbers of Gad&#x27;s Hill&quot;. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; Falstaff and his cronies organise a highway robbery there.

Gad&#x27;s Hill Place was once the home of Charles Dickens, who bought it in 1856 for £1,790 and died there in 1870. In its garden once stood a Swiss chalet in which Dickens would compose his works. The chalet is now in the gardens of Eastgate House, Rochester. There are signs at the parish boundaries depicting Dickens&#x27; characters.

The house itself is now a private school, originally for girls, but now mixed.

===Higham Marshes===
The marshes are an important wetland habitat for many species of wildfowl. There are waymarked walking trails across the marshes.

==Communications==
* &quot;Canal&quot;: The Thames and Medway Canal now terminates at Higham. Opened 1824, the canal used to connect the Thames at Gravesend to the Medway at Strood. It lost the second half of its route c. 1847 when the railway took over the Higham and Strood canal tunnel, but continued to operate from Gravesend to Higham until 1934. It is now disused but there are plans to restore it for leisure use.
* &quot;Bicycle&quot;: Canal Road which runs beside the canal is used by National Cycle Route 1 (between Gravesend and Medway).
* &quot;Railways&quot;: Higham railway station is located in Higham (lower), near the entrance to the former canal tunnel. It is served by the North Kent Line. This section of the line was closed throughout 2004, to allow the chalk tunnel to be completely relined after a series of roof falls.
* &quot;Roads&quot;: The main A226 road between Gravesend and Rochester runs to the south of Higham village.

Other transport issues relating to Higham include a planned new Lower Thames Crossing through Shorne Woods Country Park and a proposal for a new Thames Hub Airport on the nearby Isle of Grain, abandoned in July 2015 on the recommendation of the Airports Commission.

==Demographics==
At the 2001 UK census, the parish of Higham had 3,471 residents and 1,580 households.

For every 100 females, there were 92.5 males. The age distribution was 5% aged 0–4 years, 13% aged 5–15 years, 8% aged 16–24 years, 24% aged 25–44 years, 31% aged 45–64 years and 19% aged 65 years and over.

==Economy==
As at the 2001 UK census, 62.3% of Higham residents aged 16–74 were in employment, 2.2% were unemployed and 34.1% were economically inactive. Unemployment was low compared to the national rate of 3.4%. 21% of residents aged 16–74 had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared to 20% nationally.

<doc id="903988" wikidata="Q121780" url="?curid=903988" title="Michael Matheson (politician)">
<text>Michael Stephen Matheson (born 8 September 1970) is a Scottish politician who has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999, first representing the Central Scotland region and, since 2007, the Falkirk West constituency. Matheson previously served in the Scottish government as Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care from 2023 to 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Energy and Transport from 2018 to 2023, and Cabinet Secretary for Justice from 2014 to 2018.

A graduate of the Queen Margaret University and The Open University, Matheson worked as an occupational therapist in local government, before his election to Holyrood in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. He served successively as the SNP&#x27;s shadow deputy minister for justice and rural development and shadow minister for culture and sport. Matheson ran unsuccessfully, twice, for the Falkirk West constituency, however, remained as an additional member for the Central Scotland region until the 2007 election, when he won the Falkirk West seat. He sat on the SNP&#x27;s backbenches from 2007 until 2011, when he was appointed Minister for Public Health in First Minister Alex Salmond&#x27;s second government, supporting Nicola Sturgeon, and later Alex Neil, in their role as Health Secretary. 

Following the appointment of Sturgeon as First Minister, she promoted Matheson to the Scottish Cabinet as the Justice Secretary. In a 2018 Scottish Cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed to the new post of Cabinet Secretary of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity. The office was retitled as the Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Energy and Transport in Sturgeon&#x27;s third administration, as part of her government&#x27;s effort to tackle the climate emergency.

Following Sturgeon&#x27;s resignation and the appointment of Humza Yousaf as First Minister, Matheson was appointed Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care in 2023. Following a scandal surrounding the misuse of a Parliamentary iPad while on a family holiday, which incurred £11,000 in roaming charges, Matheson resigned as Health Secretary in February 2024. Matheson was subsequently suspended from Holyrood for 27 days and had his salary withdrawn for 54 days, the heaviest sanction ever awarded to an MSP.

== Early life ==

=== Birth and education ===
Michael Stephen Matheson was born on 8 September 1970 in Glasgow. He was raised in the Toryglen district and educated at John Bosco Secondary School in the city. He then attended Queen Margaret University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in occupational therapy in 1991. He later went on to graduate from The Open University with both a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Postgraduate diploma in applied social sciences. Following graduation, he worked as a community occupational therapist for eight years, until his election to the Scottish Parliament.

=== Early political career ===
Matheson worked for Highland Regional Council, Central Regional Council and Stirling Council. He first stood as a parliamentary candidate for the SNP in the 1997 general election, standing for the newly created Hamilton North and Bellshill constituency.

==Political career==

=== Election to Holyrood ===
In the 1999 Scottish parliamentary election, Matheson contested the Falkirk West constituency, which was won by the independent Dennis Canavan, who had been rejected by the Labour Party. However, Matheson was ranked third on the SNP&#x27;s regional list for Central Scotland and was one of the five SNP candidates elected in the region.

=== SNP in opposition: 1999–2007 ===
He served as Shadow Deputy Minister for Justice from May 1999 until September 2004, and as Shadow Deputy Minister for Rural Development from October 2001 until September 2004. Matheson also served on the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, and the Justice 1 Committee between 1999 and 2004. During the 2000 SNP deputy leadership election, he was the campaign manager for Roseanna Cunningham.

He contested the Falkirk West constituency again at the 2003 Scottish parliamentary election, and although it was won again by Denis Canavan, Matheson was re-elected as one of three SNP MSPs for Central Scotland. In the parliament&#x27;s second session he served on the Justice 1 Committee, the Enterprise and Culture Committee and the Justice 2 Committee. From September 2004 until September 2006, he was Shadow Minister for Culture and Sport.

=== Backbencher: 2007–2011 ===
Matheson won the constituency in the 2007 election with a majority of 776 votes over Labour, after Canavan stepped down. (Canavan later endorsed Matheson for re-election in 2011).
Matheson was a member of the Health and Sport Committee from June 2007 until March 2011 and was the Deputy Convener of the European and External Relations Committee from March 2009 until July 2010. He was also a member of the End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill Committee.

Before becoming a Minister, Matheson was actively involved in a number of Parliamentary Cross-Party Groups, including those on Malawi, Sport, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, International development, Russia and Taiwan.

At the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election, he retained his seat with an increased majority of 5,745 votes over Labour.

=== Salmond Administration: 2011–2014 ===
He was appointed as Minister for Public Health after the SNP landslide in 2011, a position he held until the November 2014 reshuffle which saw him promoted to cabinet rank as Cabinet Secretary for Justice.

=== Justice Secretary: 2014–2018 ===
Following the appointment of Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister of Scotland, she appointed Matheson as the Cabinet Secretary for Justice on 21 November 2014. In Sturgeon&#x27;s 2016 cabinet reshuffle, he remained in the post of Justice Secretary. Matheson was supported by the Minister for Community Safety, Paul Wheelhouse, and later, Annabelle Ewing. 

==== Crime and policing ====
Matheson supported efforts to merge British Transport Police with Police Scotland. He also proposed for the criminal justice system in Scotland to move from prison towards rehabilitation in a bid to reduce re-offending rates.

==== Criminal misconduct within police authorities ====
The justice system in Scotland was claimed to have been in a &quot;state of chaos&quot; amid criminal misconduct of high ranking officials in Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority. The scandal erupted following the absence leave of chief constable of Police Scotland Phil Gormley, who was accused of bullying. He resigned and was succeeded by his deputy Iain Livingston. The chief executive and chair of governing body the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) also resigned. In 2018, a BBC Scotland investigation raised concerns that &quot;bad practices and unlawful behaviour in the previous eight regional forces had continued&quot; after Police Scotland was established in 2013. 

Matheson was accused of being &quot;invisible&quot; and &quot;closing down questions&quot; amid allegations of gross misconduct and leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, raised the possibility he may have acted unlawful. Scottish Labour also claimed Matheson was unlawful after ignoring recommendations by the SPA not to allow Gormley to return from his suspension.

=== Transport Secretary: 2018–2023 ===
In a cabinet reshuffle in 2018, he was shifted to Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity. In 2021, his portfolio changed, with infrastructure and connectivity being replaced with net zero and energy, becoming Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Energy and Transport.

=== Health Secretary: 2023–2024 ===
Matheson endorsed Humza Yousaf in the 2023 Scottish National Party leadership election. Following Yousaf&#x27;s election as party leader and appointment as First Minister, Matheson was appointed Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care in his government.

In November 2023, Matheson was revealed to have incurred £10,935 in roaming charges after taking a Parliamentary iPad on a family holiday to Morocco. Matheson claimed that he incurred the charges while completing constituency work, and that he had not been aware that he needed to replace the SIM card in the iPad to switch over to the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s current mobile contract. Matheson attempted to claim £3,000 of the bill from his expenses budget, with the Scottish Parliament paying the remainder out of its own budget. First Minister Humza Yousaf described this as a &quot;legitimate parliamentary expense&quot;. Matheson&#x27;s bill was described as being more than the total of all MSPs&#x27; mobile phone, business line, tablet and staff phone bill expenses claimed in 2022/23 combined: the total for all phone-related expenses in that year was £9,507.

It was subsequently revealed that Matheson had been emailed by Parliamentary officials in February 2022, warning him of the need to update the SIM cards in his devices almost a year in advance of his holiday. Following this, Matheson agreed to personally pay back the full cost of the data roaming bill. On 16 November, Matheson admitted to the Scottish Parliament that the charges had been incurred owing to his sons using the iPad to watch football matches, and that he would refer himself to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body for investigation, but would not stand down as health secretary. On 19 November, Humza Yousaf re-iterated his confidence in Matheson, describing him as a man of integrity and honesty, and insisted that he had not been misled by the health secretary over the bill.

On 8 February 2024, ahead of the publication of an investigation into the incident by the Scottish Parliament Corporate Body, Matheson resigned as Health Secretary. In his resignation letter to First Minister Humza Yousaf, Matheson said that he had not yet received the Corporate Body&#x27;s report, but that; &quot;it is in the best interest of myself and the government for me to now step down to ensure this does not become a distraction to taking forward the government&#x27;s agenda.&quot;

=== Backbencher: 2024–present ===
Matheson continued to serve as an SNP backbencher following his resignation as Health Secretary. The Scottish Parliament Corporate Body&#x27;s report, published on 14 March, upheld three complaints against Matheson and concluded that he had breached sections 7.3 and 7.4 of the MSPs&#x27; Code of Conduct. The report was passed to the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee.

The committee reported on 23 May 2024, recommending a 27-day ban from the Scottish Parliament, as well as Matheson&#x27;s being withheld his salary as an MSP for 54 days. This was described as the toughest sanction ever recommended for an MSP. The First Minister, John Swinney, declared that he would not support the committee&#x27;s recommended sanction, describing Matheson as a &quot;friend and colleague&quot; who had &quot;made mistakes&quot;, and casting doubt on the integrity of the committee&#x27;s process: describing the process as &quot;prejudiced&quot;, Swinney claimed that Conservative MSP Annie Wells should have removed herself from the committee due to previous comments about Matheson&#x27;s conduct. Michael Matheson also said the issue had &quot;become highly politicised&quot;, which he claimed had &quot;compromised the fairness of the process&quot;. He described the proposed sanctions as &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot;, but said that he would accept the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s decision.

Swinney&#x27;s support for Matheson was described as &quot;incredible and indefensible&quot; by the Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, and &quot;unbelievable and embarrassing&quot; by the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. The Scottish Conservatives declared their intention to table a non-binding motion calling for Matheson to resign as an MSP. SNP Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes subsequently introduced an amendment that re-iterated Swinney&#x27;s complaints about the investigation into Matheson, but did not attempt to change the sanction. The SNP&#x27;s position on the sanctions appeared to change throughout the day of the vote on the committee&#x27;s recommendations, and despite indications that it would back the proposed sanction, the party ultimately abstained on the vote on the committee&#x27;s recommendations: the SNP amendment was backed by 68 MSPs, with 56 against, and the amended motion sanctioning Matheson passed with the backing of 64 MSPs.

Matheson returned to work at Holyrood on 10 September 2024. In November 2024, he submitted an application to stand again as the SNP candidate for Falkirk West in the next Scottish Parliament election, to the disquiet of his constituency party.

== Personal life ==
Matheson has been married to Susan Totten since 2005. They have two sons, James and Daniel, and a stepson, Sean O’Donnell.

<text>The Malatestiana Library (), also known as the Malatesta Novello Library, is a public library in the city of Cesena in northern Italy. Purpose-built from 1447 to 1452 and opened in 1454, and named after the local aristocrat Malatesta Novello, it is significant for being the first civic library in Europe, i.e. belonging to the commune rather than the church or a noble family, and open to the general public. The library was inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in 2005.

== Background ==
For two and a half centuries from 1239, when a Malatesta was made Podestà of Rimini, the family ruled parts of the territory on either side of the River Rubicon in northern Italy where the Apennine Mountains meet the Adriatic Sea. In 1429 the inheritance was divided between two sons of Pandolfo I Malatesta. The elder, Sigismondo Pandolfo, became Lord of Rimini. The younger, Malatesta Novello, became Lord of Cesena, and founded the only early Renaissance library which preserves its original building, furniture and books.

A &quot;studium&quot;, or university, had existed in the convent of San Francesco in Cesena from the fourteenth century. In 1445, at a period when many religious houses in northern Europe as well as Italy felt the need for a room to hold their books, the friars decided to build a library and were authorised by a papal bull of that year to pay the cost from a charitable bequest intended by the benefactor for other uses. But although the initiative came from the convent, Malatesta Novello seems to have intervened at an early stage. He certainly chose the architect, Matteo Nuti, who had worked for the Malatesta in Fano and Rimini, and his promise to give the library books worth five hundred florins is recorded in a second papal bull of 1450.

Building probably started in 1447 and was completed in 1452. It took another two years to furnish the interior and supply the elaborately carved wooden doors. The new wing of the convent was on two storeys, with a refectory on the ground floor, a dormitory and the library above. The latter follows Michelozzo&#x27;s design for the library of San Marco in Florence, constructed about 1440: a rectangular room with a vaulted ceiling carried on two rows of columns. Each aisle is occupied by twenty-nine benches and desks, three to a bay. The light (now partly obscured by new buildings) enters by a rosace in the end wall and a line of arched windows on either side, falling conveniently at right angles to the reader&#x27;s position.

In the pediment over the entrance is the family&#x27;s favourite device of an elephant, with the motto &quot;Elephas Indicus culices non timet&quot; - &#x27;The Indian elephant does not fear mosquitoes&#x27;. The Malatesta arms and emblems appear on many capitals and are carved and painted on the end of each desk. Tablets on the entrance wall bear the inscription, MAL. NOV. PAN. F. HOC DEDIT OPUS (&#x27;Malatesta Novello, son of Pandolfo, gave this work&#x27;), a memorial repeated in a slightly different form at intervals in the floor tiles. The books lie either on the sloping tops of the desks or on a shelf below, and are attached by a chain running from a staple on the lower cover to a ring which moves freely along a metal rod fastened above the shelf.

== History and influence ==
The building and creation of the library was commissioned by the Lord of Cesena, Malatesta Novello. Construction was directed by Matteo Nuti from Fano (a pupil of Leon Battista Alberti) and lasted from 1447 to 1452. At Novello&#x27;s direction, the books were owned by the commune of Cesena, not the monastery or the family. Because of this governing structure, the collection was not dispersed like many monastic libraries.

In 2005 UNESCO included the Library in the Memory of the World Programme Register.

== Facility ==


The Malatestiana Library is one of the very few libraries (another one is the Librije in Zutphen, Netherlands) in the world of the so-called humanistic-conventual type, which blends humanistic principles with architecture otherwise reserved for religious buildings, and has preserved its structure, fittings and codices since its opening more than 550 years ago. The main doorway was the work of sculptor Agostino di Duccio (1418–1481). The walnut door at the main entrance dates back to 1454 and was carved by the artist Cristoforo from San Giovanni in Persiceto.

Inside, the library features geometric design, typical of the early Italian Renaissance style. The aula has the layout of a basilica (reflecting the importance of the library as a &quot;temple of culture&quot;), with three naves divided by ten rows of white columns made from local stone; there are eleven bays in each aisle, which are pole vaulted. The central nave is barrel vaulted and ends with a rose under which is the gravestone of Malatesta Novello.

The fittings are composed of 58 desks, with coat of arms at the sides. The light comes in through the 44 Venetian style windows, which were purpose designed to provide ideal lighting for reading.

== Holdings ==
The convent already owned about fifty books. Besides a splendid thirteenth-century Bible in four volumes and a group of handsomely-illuminated law-books bequeathed by a certain Fredolo Fantini of Cesena, all produced in Bologna, they included several biblical commentaries of north French origin and philosophical works probably acquired by Italian students or professors in Paris. This nucleus was smartened up by being rebound and having missing leaves and tables of contents provided.

Malatesta Novello greatly expanded the collection and had his &quot;scriptorium&quot; copy several works of history, literature and philology. Beside the &quot;scriptorium&quot;&#x27;s productions, books came from a variety of sources. There are several Greek manuscripts, including the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot; and &quot;Republic&quot;, a Demosthenes written by a Greek scribe in Italy, and another Demosthenes bought in 1431 from a Genoese merchant in Constantinople by Niccolò Martinozzi, later Malatesta Novello&#x27;s chancellor. Roberto Valturio&#x27;s &quot;Res militares&quot; was a present from Sigismondo Pandolfo, and there were gifts from Cardinal Bessarion and Francesco Filelfo. Malatesta Novello bought also many late medieval Latin manuscripts, including a Boethius of about 1400 with illumination by Michelino da Besozzo and an handsome Parisian fourteenth-century Bible.

The library was expanded even further thanks to personal donations by renown scholars: in 1474 it received the books of Giovanni di Marco of Rimini, who had been doctor to Pope Sixtus IV and to both the Malatesta brothers. After some years&#x27; delay about eighty volumes reached Cesena, mostly fourteenth-century manuscripts of medicine and philosophy. It is uncertain whether Giovanni di Marco owned the oldest manuscript in the collection, a copy of Isidore&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot; written in the Verona &quot;scriptorium&quot; in the ninth century, annotated by Ratherius and doubtless abstracted from the cathedral library after the fall of the Scaligers.

The library survived a crisis during the Napoleonic Wars when the convent was suppressed, the building requisitioned as a barracks and the furniture and books removed to store. Nevertheless in its whole history it has lost only six volumes, one of which was removed by the Inquisition and two by the French Republican commissioners.

Today the library has over 400,000 books, including over 340 codices covering various fields such as religion, Greek and Latin classics, sciences and medicine, and about 3,200 manuscripts from the 16th century.

<text>The Savio is a river in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. Its source is in the province of Forlì-Cesena near Montecoronaro on Mount Castelvecchio which is near the western side of Mount Fumaiolo. The source is at an elevation of and is marked by an iron monument. A wolf (the symbol of Montecoronaro) and the rings of the &quot;caveja&quot; (a symbol of Romagna) are on this monument. The river flows near Verghereto and Bagno di Romagna as it winds through the mountains before entering Lago di Quarto. After leaving the lake, the river flows northeast near Sarsina (near the border with the province of Pesaro and Urbino) and Mercato Saraceno before flowing north. The river winds for along the valley. Its natural track has been preserved relatively well and, in the territory of Cesena, it shows an environment which is one of the purest of the whole Romagna. North of Cesena, the river crosses the border into the province of Ravenna. After a total course of the river enters the Adriatic Sea north of Cervia by Lido di Classe and Lido di Savio.

The River Savio Natural Park, along around a loop which once hosted a cave, starts from the two historical bridges of Cesena.

The park contains many species of animals and plants. The trees divide the area in two belts: the one near the waters contains white willows with black and white poplars; the second presents locust-trees.

Although the park is relatively small, many animals are visible here, both birds (herons, king-fishers, woodpeckers and raptors) and mammals (hares, porcupines, foxes, and roe deer).

<doc id="904019" wikidata="Q874016" url="?curid=904019" title="Kawasaki Frontale">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo. The club currently compete in the J1 League, which is the top tier of football in the country. Their home stadium is Kawasaki Todoroki Stadium in Nakahara Ward, located in the central area of Kawasaki.

==History==
=== Establishment and earlier years (1955–1977) ===

The club was founded in 1955 as Fujitsu Soccer Club. It was one of many city clubs that comprised the Japan Soccer League (JSL), including Yomiuri (later Tokyo Verdy 1969), Toshiba (later Consadole Sapporo) and NKK SC (now defunct). They first made the JSL Division 1 in 1977, only to be relegated the next season.

=== Professional transition and relegations (1997–2000) ===

Fujitsu&#x27;s club became professional in 1997, and changed its name to &quot;Kawasaki Frontale&quot;, which means &quot;frontal&quot; in Italian. The club old crest and colours are based on those of Brazilian side Grêmio, because both clubs have cooperated since 26 March 1997.

The club joined the second division of the J.League in 1999 and went on to become the champion of the division. But in the next season, they sank to the bottom of J.League Division 1 and were relegated.

Frontale would not return to the top flight until 2000, when they were promoted to the rebranded J1. But they were once again dropped to the J2 at the end of the season.

=== Back to the top flight and AFC Champions League debut (2004–2007) ===

In 2004, Frontale crowned champions of J2 and won promotion to J1 for the second time. With the former rival city clubs out of the way due to relocation or liquidation, they began building their power base in the city.

In 2006, the club achieved runners-up position in J1, their highest league position up to that time. As a result, they entered the AFC Champions League for the first time in 2007 from the group stage.

Kawasaki made important success in the competition, as they became the first Japanese club for qualifying its group stage before the eventual winners, Urawa Red Diamonds. However, they eventually lost in the quarter finals against Iranian club, Sepahan, in a penalty shoot-out, following two scoreless games.

=== Prominence era under Toru Oniki (2017–2024) ===

After two more second-place finishes in 2008 and 2009, Kawasaki finally won the title in 2017, coming from behind to upstage bitter rivals Kashima Antlers after they were held to a draw at Júbilo Iwata, 16 seasons and 40 years after their first promotion to the top division.

Kawasaki became the first team to win four J1 titles in a five-year span. They came up short multiple times (2000, 2007, 2009 and 2017) but won their first J.League Cup in 2019, beating Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo on penalties. In 2020, they successfully won their third J1 League title with 83 points, staying 17 points clear off the runners-up, Gamba Osaka. They made sure of the title with four games to spare, which was a record under the 34-match league format. With a player depth not being restricted to the starting XI, Frontale managed to get the best out of the five substitutions allowed by the J. League, per FIFA recommendation, instated after the COVID-19 outbreak. A good example was a breakout season by Kaoru Mitoma, who started more matches on the bench than in the starting XI.

In 2021, Frontale won their first title of the year in the opening match of the season, beating Gamba Osaka 3–2 in the 2021 Japanese Super Cup.

Raised standards, eye-catching performances, and increase of national team level players coming from Frontale led foreign clubs to pay attention to their players. Among the most significant departures, Frontale saw two major talents leaving the club mid-season. Kaoru Mitoma was included in the 2020 J.League Best XI in his first full season as a professional despite playing less than half of his matches as a starter for Frontale, being signed by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion of the Premier League. The second one was midfielder, Ao Tanaka. The 2020 J.League Rookie of the Year which quickly earned his spot on the starting XI after turning professional, transferring to Fortuna Düsseldorf of 2. Bundesliga on loan, which later would have his deal turning permanent. They weren&#x27;t the only departures leaving a mark on the team, as they followed Hidemasa Morita to Europe, as the latter went on to sign for Santa Clara of the Primeira Liga.

However, despite Frontale having their future performances being apparently threatened after these departures, the club went on to win the 2021 J1 League with a record-breaking season, which saw them: Winning the most points on a single J1 League season ever, with 92 points won on 38 matches; Achieving the fewest number of losses on a J1 League season, registering only two losses in total (the first J1 loss only came six months after the season opening); Being the joint unbeaten team at home matches in a J1 League season, equalling Urawa Red Diamonds&#x27;s tally in 2006; Being the first ever J1 team to win more than 80 points on consecutive seasons.

Leandro Damião, with 23 goals, was Frontale&#x27;s individual highlight on the 2021 season, helping him win the MVP award, after being the joint league top-scorer and one of the players with the most assists of the tournament. The latter record was accomplished by another Frontale players, Miki Yamane, which also saw several call-ups for the National Team throughout the 2021 and 2022 season, alongside other Frontale players and formers players, like the team captain Shogo Taniguchi, and midfielder Yasuto Wakizaka. They joined many other players who previously were selected for the Japan national football team while playing at Frontale. Of the selected players, some players can be highlighted, like defender Yoshinobu Minowa, who was selected in 2005. After the 2006 FIFA World Cup, midfielder Kengo Nakamura and forward Kazuki Ganaha became new Japan internationals, especially Kengo Nakamura, who being a mainstay at club and country for a long time. Long-serving for the national team, goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima was also selected while at Frontale, making his debut on the 2008 East Asian Cup. Shuhei Terada, who played all of his 13-year professional career at Frontale, was also selected for the national team from 2008 to 2009.

After five consecutive seasons winning at least one major title from 2017 to 2021, Frontale tasted a season without winning any silverware for the entire 2022. Taking their previous overall season into account, the club went through an uninspired season, which saw early eliminations in all four competitions the club played that involved knockout-stage formats. In February, the club already saw their first match of the season resulting on a defeat, after losing 2–0 by Urawa Red Diamonds at the Super Cup. On April, the club was eliminated at the 2022 AFC Champions League at its group stage, finishing their group as runners-up, behind Malaysian champions Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim. In June, at the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, Frontale were unexpectedly eliminated, at the third round of the competition, after being defeated by J2 League club Tokyo Verdy by 1–0.

On the latter half of the season, Frontale continued an atypically poor run of form. On August, the club started their campaign at the J.League Cup, entering the competition late in the double-legged quarterfinals, after receiving a bye from the early stages of the competition due to their AFC Champions League qualification. The club played this quarterfinal against Cerezo Osaka￼ and was awarded the hosting rights of the tie&#x27;s second leg. Despite not losing any of the two legs, Frontale didn&#x27;t won any, either. At Cerezo, the match ended 1–1, giving a theoretical relief for Frontale ahead of the match, who only needed a 0–0 draw or a win to proceed in the competition. Frontale started the second leg winning 2–0, with Marcinho scoring two goals at the 40th and 53rd minute. Surprisingly, Frontale collapsed at the dying minutes of the match, conceding two heading goals at the 90th and 95th minute, respectively.

Following the elimination at the J.League Cup, only the J1 League title was then available for Frontale to chase. Oscillating placements throughout the campaign, the club still managed to finish five separate matchweeks at the top of the league in the first half of the season. In the second half of the season, though, never again did Frontale get past the second place. Serving as a minor consolation for their season, the club held to a hardly fought title chase alongside Sanfrecce Hiroshima (until the closing matchweeks). In December, at the 38th round, the last round of the season, Frontale were narrow two points away from first-placed Yokohama F. Marinos. A 13-goal difference was also in Frontale&#x27;s way, meaning that in the more realistic scenario, Frontale needed to win their match and expect Marinos to lose theirs. Playing the round against FC Tokyo, Frontale were early threatened with a red card, as Jung Sung-ryong was sent off a few minutes after Frontale&#x27;s first goal. Despite playing the rest of the match with 10 players, Frontale still managed to win past FC Tokyo by 3–2. Playing against Vissel Kobe, Marinos won the match by 3–1, and then were handed the J1 League title. On the plus side, finishing as the league&#x27;s runners-up led the club to qualify for the 2023–24 AFC Champions League, entering the competition in the group stage.

On 9 December 2023, Frontale won the 2023 Emperor&#x27;s Cup title, beating Kashiwa Reysol 8–7 in the penalty shootout after the match ended 0–0. This second national cup victory resulting their qualification for the 2024–25 AFC Champions League Elite, entering directly from the league stage.

On 17 February 2024, Frontale defeated 2023 J1 League champions, Vissel Kobe, in the 2024 Japanese Super Cup at Japan National Stadium to clinch their third title of the competition.

On 16 October 2024, it was announced that Toru Oniki would step down as head coach of the club at the end of the season, following the expiration of his contract.

=== Mid-table finish and arrival of Shigetoshi Hasebe (2025–present) ===

Following the departure of Oniki, along with mid-table finish at 8th position in both 2023 and 2024, it was announced by Frontale that Shigetoshi Hasebe, who left his position at Avispa Fukuoka, would become the new manager for 2025 season. Hasebe began his tenure with a 4-0 victory over the Pohang Steelers in the AFC Champions League Elite group stage, and followed up with a 4-0 win over Nagoya Grampus in the J1 League opener.

==Rivalries==

=== Tamagawa Clásico ===
Frontale&#x27;s rivalry with FC Tokyo is known as the Tamagawa Clásico (using the Spanish word &quot;Clásico&quot; as used in derbies in Spain and Latin America). The two clubs first met in the inaugural Kanto Soccer League in 1967, but did not meet again until 1991 in the old Japan Soccer League Division 2 and were rivals for promotion to the J.League in the 1990s. They co-founded the new J2 League in 1999 and were promoted together the same year, and although Frontale were immediately relegated, they were promoted again in 2005 and have regularly met since then.

Frontale also has a Tamagawa rivalry with Tokyo Verdy 1969, which was originally also based in Kawasaki and moved to Chofu, Tokyo in 2000. The two were co-founders of the JSL Division 2 in 1972 and, although spent 20 seasons (1979 to 1999) in separate tiers, rekindled the rivalry in the late 1990s as Kawasaki fans deserted Tokyo Verdy to support Frontale, seen as a more community-focused club, and since then their fortunes have reversed as Frontale is a top flight mainstay while Tokyo Verdy sunk into the second tier beginning in 2005.

<text>The lari (, ; ISO 4217: GEL) is the currency of Georgia. It is divided into 100 tetri (). The name &quot;lari&quot; is an old Georgian word denoting a hoard, property, while &quot;tetri&quot; is an old Georgian monetary term (meaning &#x27;white&#x27;) used in ancient Colchis from the 6th century BC. Earlier Georgian currencies include the maneti (), abazi (), and kuponi ().

== Kuponi ==

Georgia replaced the Soviet ruble on 5 April 1993, with the kuponi () at par. This currency consisted only of banknotes, had no subdivisions and suffered from hyperinflation. Notes were issued in denominations between 1 and 1 million kuponi, including the somewhat unusual 3, 3,000, 30,000 and 150,000 kuponi.

== Lari ==
On 2 October 1995, the government of Eduard Shevardnadze replaced the provisional coupon currency with the Lari, at a rate of one million to one. It has remained fairly stable since then.

=== Lari sign ===
The NBG announced the Lari sign competition in December 2013. The temporary commission consisted of representatives of NBG, the Budget and Finance Committee of the Parliament of Georgia, the State Council of Heraldry, the Ministry of Culture and Monument Protection of Georgia and the Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia.

On 8 July 2014, Giorgi Kadagidze, Governor of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), unveiled the winning proposal for the sign of the national currency to the public. The author of the winning sign was professional artist-ceramist, Malkhaz Shvelidze.

In choosing the winning sign, the commission gave priority to the samples based on the Georgian Mkhedruli character and made a point of the following criteria: conception, design, accordance with Georgian alphabet, existence of elements marking the currency, ease of construction, and observance of requests and recommendations determined by competition rules.

The Lari sign is based on an arched letter ლ (Lasi) of the Georgian script. It is common international practice for a currency sign to consist of a letter, crossed by one or two parallel lines. Two parallel lines crossing the letter Lasi are the basic components of the Lari sign. The so-called “leg” of the letter, represented by a horizontal line, is a necessary attribute of the sign, adding monumental stability to the upper dynamic arc. The form of the letter is transformed in order to simplify its perception and implementation as a Lari sign.

On 18 July 2014, Giorgi Melashvili, executive director of the National Bank of Georgia, sent a request letter to the Unicode Consortium to register the symbol in the Currency Symbols block of the Unicode Standard as 
: ₾ codice_1

On 17 June 2015, the Unicode Consortium released Unicode V8.0, which includes the Lari sign as 

=== Coins ===
Coins are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 tetri, as well as 1 and 2 lari.

The National Bank of Georgia announced on 5 October 2018 that it would discontinue circulation of 1 and 2 Tetri coins as of 1 January 2021, and that these coins would lose their legal tender status. 1 and 2 Tetri coins could be exchanged at the National Bank of Georgia and commercial banks in Georgia within one year from 1 January 2021, and can only be exchanged at the National Bank of Georgia from 1 January 2022. According to the new regulations on cash payments introduced by the National Bank of Georgia on 1 January 2019, 1 and 2 tetri are rounded to 0, and 3, 4, 6 and 7 tetri are rounded to 5.

The National Bank of Georgia announced on 12 November 2015 that, effective 1 January 2018, the old 50 Tetri coin, issued since 1995, would be withdrawn from circulation and the coins would lose their legal tender status. The old 50 Tetri coin were exchangeable at the National Bank of Georgia and commercial banks of Georgia within one year from 1 January 2018, and from 1 January 2019 only at the National Bank of Georgia.


=== Banknotes ===
==== 2016–2019 (current) series ====
Between November 2016 and October 2019 the National Bank of Georgia released five banknotes (in denominations of ₾5, ₾10, ₾20, ₾50, and ₾100), composing a new complete set.
The 2016–2019 series lari notes are produced by ().

==== Earlier issues ====
The National Bank of Georgia announced that banknotes of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 lari issued between 1995 and 1999 will no longer be legal tender on 1 January 2022. These currencies can only be exchanged at the National Bank of Georgia from 1 January 2022.

<text>Cristóbal Diatristán de Acuña, SJ (1597) was a Spanish Jesuit missionary and explorer.

==Biography==
He was born at Burgos in Spain. He was admitted a Jesuit in 1612, and afterwards sent on mission work to Chile and Peru, where he became rector of the college of Cuenca. In 1639 he accompanied Pedro Teixeira in his second exploration of the Amazon, in order to take scientific observations, and draw up a report for the Spanish government. The journey lasted ten months; and on the explorer&#x27;s arrival in Belém, Acuña prepared his narrative, while awaiting a ship for Europe. The king of Spain, Philip IV, received the author coldly, and, it is said even tried to suppress his book, fearing that the Portuguese, who had just revolted from Spain (1640), would profit by its information. After occupying the positions of procurator of the Jesuits at Rome and censor (&quot;calificador&quot;) of the Spanish Inquisition at Madrid, Acuña returned to South America, where he died, probably soon after 1675. His &quot;Nuevo Descubrimiento del Gran Río de las Amazonas&quot; was published at Madrid in 1641; French and English translations (the latter from the French), appeared in 1682 and 1698.

Acuña was the first to describe the Casiquiare canal, a natural canal linking the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers, in 1639.

<doc id="904033" wikidata="Q7162806" url="?curid=904033" title="Penguin sweater">
<text>Penguin sweaters, also known as penguin jumpers, are sweaters knitted for penguins that have been caught in oil slicks. 
When an oil spill affects penguins they have in the past been sometimes dressed in knitted sweaters, supposedly to stop them from poisoning themselves by ingesting the oil during preening, and to keep them warm, since the spilled oil destroys their natural oils. The sweaters are removed and discarded as soon as the penguins can be washed.

== History ==
Penguin Jumpers were invented by Clare Davis (a founder of WildLife Victoria) and brought to life by her friend Margaret Healy and another one of Clares Friends. The project originated with the Phillip Island Nature Park oil spill of January 2000 and was successfully completed, but the knitting pattern and call for volunteers to donate remained available online. Instead of the 100 or so sweaters needed, thousands were sent. The extra sweaters were stockpiled by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. As of 2014, the Australia-based Penguin Foundation is still accepting handmade sweaters but no longer uses these for penguin rehabilitation. Instead, these sweaters are used to dress toy penguins which are then sold to raise money for the foundation.
After a 2011 oil spill in New Zealand, a local yarn shop put out the call for penguin jumpers, and supplied a pattern. Jumpers were received from all over the world. However, those cleaning and rehabilitating the penguins affected said they neither used nor requested the jumpers: heat lamps were used to keep cleaned penguins warm. Once they are cleaned, there is little danger of them ingesting oil when preening – one of the rationales given for penguin sweaters – and sweaters may in fact do more harm than good to the penguins.
A penguin wetsuit has been made for a penguin who lost his feathers, and similar garments are being made for battery chicken rehabilitation.

== Controversy and potential risks ==
The use of penguin sweaters has been criticized as a potential risk to the health of the penguins, as wearing foreign garments can cause additional stress to the penguins and adversely affect their health. Instead, some wildlife rescues use heat lamps to help regulate the temperature of the birds and prevent excessive preening. The International Bird Rescue does not use penguin sweaters or any bird sweaters, because of the dangers of placing a garment on the birds that presses the oil against their skin and prevents the fumes from the oil from dissipating. Another potential risk of using penguin sweaters is that handling or wearing foreign materials can cause additional stress to the penguins.

Peter Dann, of the Philip Island Nature Park, stated that the Little Penguins dealt with by Philip Island Nature Park have different needs than the African Penguins International Bird Rescue, and that there were comparable rates of success for rehabilitating Little Penguins with sweaters and African Penguins with heat lamps.

<text>(, ; &#x27;Freedom or Death&#x27;) is the motto of Greece. It originated in the Greek songs of resistance that were powerful motivating factors for independence. It was adopted in 1814 by the , a secret organization formed specifically for the overthrow of Ottoman rule.

==Overview==
The motto arose during the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s, where it was a war cry for the Greeks who rebelled against Ottoman rule. It was adopted after the Greek War of Independence and is still in use today. One explanation for the 9 stripes on the Greek flag is that they represent the nine syllables of the motto, five blue stripes for the syllables and four white stripes for . The motto symbolized and still symbolizes the resolve of the people of Greece against tyranny and oppression.

Part of the emblem of the Filiki Eteria were two flags with the letters and ; These represent , &#x27;Either Freedom, or Death&#x27;. This is also the motto of the 4th Infantry Division of the Greek Army.

<text>The IBM 2250 Graphics Display Unit was a vector graphics display system by IBM for the System/360; the Model IV attached to the IBM 1130.

==Overview==
The IBM 2250 Graphics Display Unit was announced with System/360 in 1964. A complete 2250 III system with controller cost around $280,000 in 1970, though up to 4 displays could share a single controller, reducing the cost per display by up to 40%.

A display list of line segments (vectors) on a 1024 by 1024 grid was stored in computer&#x27;s memory or an optional buffer on the 2250 and repainted on the 2250&#x27;s CRT up to 40 times per second. The computer altered the display by changing the display list.

Characters were built of line segments specified by display list subroutines. Thus any character set or font could be displayed, although fonts were generally extremely simplified for performance reasons.
An optional character-generator feature on all models provided predefined fonts of 63 characters to simplify display of alphanumeric information.

The 2250 was housed in a desk with an alphanumeric (QWERTY) keyboard and a separate programmed function keyboard which had keys, indicator lights and switches. A plastic overlay label could be placed over the function keyboard. Punches on the top edge of the overlay could be sensed by the computer so the keys, lights and switches could be reprogrammed simply by changing overlays. The 2250s CRT measured 21&quot; diagonal, but the useful display area was 12 inch by 12 inch. A light pen was provided as a pointing device, serving the function of the modern computer mouse.

An IBM 2285 Display Copier could be attached to the 2250 to provide 8½ by 11 inch hard copy of the display contents under operator control.

An IBM 2280 Film Recorder or IBM 2282 Film Recorder/Scanner could be attached to a 2840 control unit providing for output or input/output to photographic negative.

There were four models of 2250:
* Model 1 – attached directly to a System/360 via a selector or multiplexor channel.
* Model 2 – attached via a 2840-1 control unit. A 2840 could attach up to four 2250s and provided buffering and a character generator.
* Model 3 – attached via a 2840-2 control unit.
* Model 4 – attached to an IBM 1130 minicomputer via the storage access channel (SAC). The 1130 could run either as a standalone processor or as a front-end processor connected to a remote System/360.

==Competitors==

A number of plug compatible manufacturers sold competitors to the 2250, including Adage, Evans &amp; Sutherland, Information Displays Inc., Lundy, Sanders, Spectragraphics, and Vector General.

==Successors==
In 1977 IBM introduced the 3250 Display System (manufactured by Sanders Associates) as an upgrade to the 2250.

<text>Robert Henry Clarence (6 September 1872 – 6 January 1908) also known as Robert II was the King of the Miskito Nation. He was born at the Public General Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. He was the last hereditary chief of the Miskito in 1890–1894 and briefly during July to August 1894.

Clarence succeeded to the chiefdom on the death of his cousin Jonathan Charles Frederick, Hereditary Chief of the Miskito, in July 1890. After his downfall, he was rescued by a British warship that took him into exile together with 200 refugees to Puerto Limon, Costa Rica, and later to Jamaica. He was granted a pension by the British government of £1,785 per annum, and remained head of the &quot;royal house&quot; in name until his death.

Clarence died after an operation at the Public General Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica on 6 January 1908. He was married once to Irene Morrison, with whom he had two children, one of which was the &quot;princess&quot; Mary Clarence. He was succeeded as head of the royal house by his cousin Robert Frederick.

<text>China Burma India Theater (CBI) was the United States military designation during World War II for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|China]] and [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Southeast Asian]] or India–Burma (IBT) theaters. Operational command of Allied forces (including U.S. forces) in the CBI was officially the responsibility of the Supreme Commanders for South East Asia or China. In practice, U.S. forces were usually overseen by General Joseph Stilwell, the Deputy Allied Commander in China; the term &quot;CBI&quot; was significant in logistical, material and personnel matters; it was and is commonly used within the US for these theaters.

U.S. and Chinese fighting forces in the CBI included the Chinese Expeditionary Force, the Flying Tigers, transport and bomber units flying the Hump, including the Tenth Air Force, the 1st Air Commando Group, the engineers who built the Ledo Road, the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), popularly known as &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;, and the 5332d Brigade, Provisional or &#x27;Mars Task Force&#x27;, which assumed the Marauders&#x27; mission.

== U.S. strategy for China ==
Japanese policy towards China had long been a source of international controversy. Western powers had exploited China through the open door policy, advocated by United States diplomat William Woodville Rockhill, while Japan intervened more directly, creating the puppet-state of Manchukuo. By 1937, Japan was engaged in a full-scale war of conquest in China. The infamous Rape of Nanking galvanized Western opinion and led to direct financial aid for the Kuomintang (Nationalists) and increasing economic sanctions against Japan.

In 1941, the U.S. made a series of decisions to support China in its war with Japan: Lend Lease supplies were provided after President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the defense of China to be vital to the defense of the United States. Over the summer, as Japan moved south into French Indo-China, the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands instituted an oil embargo on Japan, cutting off 90% of its supplies. The embargo threatened the operations of the Kwantung Army, which had over a million soldiers deployed in China. Japan responded with a tightly co-ordinated offensive on 7/8 December, simultaneously attacking Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong, Guam, Wake Island, and Thailand.

Japan cut off Allied supplies to China that had been coming through Burma. China could be supplied only by flying over the Himalaya mountains (&quot;The Hump&quot;) from India, or capturing territory in Burma and building a new road—the Ledo Road. 

== Burma ==

In 1941 and 1942, Japan was overextended. Its naval base could not defend its conquests, and its industrial base could not strengthen its navy. To cut off China from Allied aid, it went into Burma and captured Rangoon on 8 March 1942, cutting off the Burma Road. Moving north, the Japanese took Tounggoo and captured Lashio in northern Burma on 29 April. The British, primarily concerned with India, looked to Burma as the main theater of action against Japan and wanted Chinese troops to fight there. The United States conjured up visions of millions of Chinese soldiers who would hold the Japanese then throw them back, while providing close-in airbases for a systematic firebombing of Japanese cities. Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek realized it was all fantasy. On the other hand, there were vast sums of American dollars available if he collaborated. He did so and managed to feed his starving soldiers, but they were so poorly equipped and led that offensive operations against the Japanese in China were impossible. However, Chiang did release the Chinese Expeditionary Force of two Chinese armies for action in Burma under Stilwell. Due to conflicts between Chiang, the British, Stilwell, and American General Claire Chennault, as well as general ill-preparedness against the more proficient Japanese army, the Burma defense collapsed. Stilwell escaped to India, but the recovery of Burma and construction of the Ledo Road to supply China became a new obsession for him.

&quot;On April 14, 1942, William Donovan, as Coordinator of Information (forerunner of the Office of Strategic Services), activated Detachment 101 for action behind enemy lines in Burma. The first unit of its kind, the Detachment was charged with gathering intelligence, harassing the Japanese through guerrilla actions, identifying targets for the Army Air Force to bomb, and rescuing downed Allied airmen. Because Detachment 101 was never larger than a few hundred Americans, it relied on support from various tribal groups in Burma. In particular, the vigorously anti-Japanese Kachin people were vital to the unit&#x27;s success.&quot; Detachment 101&#x27;s efforts opened the way for Stilwell&#x27;s Chinese forces, Wingate&#x27;s Raiders, Merrill&#x27;s Marauders, and the counter-attack against the Japanese Imperial life-line.

==Allied command structure==

===U.S. and Allied land forces===

US forces in the CBI were administered by General Joseph &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell. However, unlike other combat theaters, for example the European Theater of Operations, the CBI was never a &quot;theater of operations&quot; and did not have an overall operational command structure. Initially U.S. land units were split. Those in China were technically commanded by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, as Stillwell was Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander in China. When the GALAHAD force (later to become the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)) arrived in Bombay in October 1943, it came under the British-led South East Asia Command (SEAC) and Admiral Lord Mountbatten. However, Stilwell often broke the chain of command and communicated directly with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff on operational matters. 

When joint allied command was agreed upon, it was decided that the senior position should be held by a British officer because the British had the greatest number of forces in India and Burma (in much the same way as the US did in the Pacific War). Admiral Lord Mountbatten was appointed as the Supreme Allied Commander of South-East Asia forces in October 1943. Chiang however later objected to deferring to Mountbatten on matters related to operations in China.

General Stilwell, who also had operational command of the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC), a US-Chinese formation, was to report in theory to Gen. George Giffard – commander of Eleventh Army Group – so that NCAC and the British Fourteenth Army, under the command of General William Slim, could be co-ordinated. However, in practice, Gen. Stilwell never agreed to this arrangement. Stilwell was able to do this because of his multiple positions within complex command structures, including especially his simultaneous positions of Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, and Chief of Staff to Chinese leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. As SEAC&#x27;s deputy leader, Stilwell was Giffard&#x27;s superior, but as operational commander of NCAC, Giffard was Stilwell&#x27;s superior. As the two men did not get on, this inevitably lead to conflict and confusion.
Eventually at a SEAC meeting to sort out the chain of command for NCAC, Stilwell astonished everyone by saying &quot;I am prepared to come under General Slim&#x27;s operational control until I get to Kamaing&quot;. Although far from ideal, this compromise was accepted.

Although Stilwell was the control and co-ordinating point for all command activity in the theater, his assumption of personal direction of the advance of the Chinese Ledo forces into north Burma in late 1943 meant that he was often out of touch with both his own headquarters and with the overall situation.

Not until late 1944, after Stilwell was recalled to Washington, was the chain of command clarified. His overall role, and the CBI command, was then split among three people: Lt Gen. Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia; Major-General Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek, and commander of US Forces, China Theater (USFCT). Lt Gen. Daniel Sultan was promoted, from deputy commander of CBI to commander of US Forces, India–Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC. The 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA), and NCAC was decisively placed under this formation. However, by the time the last phase of the Burma Campaign began in earnest, NCAC had become irrelevant, and it was dissolved in early 1945.

=== Training the Chinese Army ===
Ramgarh Training Center, in Bihar Province, India, an American-staffed, American-operated organisation, was established on 30 June 1942 by General Stilwell, the Commanding General, USAF, CBI, for the training of Chinese troops in India. The Supreme Commander, China Theater, General Chiang Kai-Shek, had approved Ramgarh Cantonment, as the site for a training center to train, equip, and reinforce the Chinese troops that had retreated into India from Burma.

The first Chinese troops arrived on 17 July 1942. 

Headquarters RTC and Hq Camp Ramgarh combined and CG RTC assumed command on 1 February 1943. (These two organizations and Hq Chinese Army in India were the three original command organizations at Ramgarh.) Headquarters Ramgarh Training Center was responsible for the training of Chinese Army in India, and Headquarters Chinese Army in India was responsible for the activation, organization, administration, and command of Chinese units.

===U.S. Army and Allied Air Forces===
After consultation among the Allied governments, Air Command South-East Asia was formed in November 1943 to control all Allied air forces in the theater, with Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse as Commander-in-Chief. Under Peirse&#x27;s deputy, USAAF Major General George E. Stratemeyer, Eastern Air Command (EAC) was organized in 1943 to control Allied air operations in Burma, with headquarters in Calcutta. Unlike the strained relations and confusion with Allied ground force commands, air force operations in the CBI were relatively smooth. Relations improved even further after new U.S. military aid began arriving, together with capable USAAF officers such as Brigadier General William D. Old of CBI Troop Carrier Command, and Colonels Philip Cochran and John R. Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group. Within Eastern Air Command, Air Marshal Sir John Baldwin commanded the Third Tactical Air Force, originally formed to provide close air support to the Fourteenth Army. Baldwin was later succeeded by Air Marshal Sir Alec Coryton. U.S. Brigadier-General Howard C. Davidson and later Air Commodore F. J. W. Mellersh commanded the Strategic Air Force. In the new command, various units of the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Tenth Air Force worked side-by-side. In the autumn of 1943 SEAAC had 48 RAF and 17 USAAF squadrons; by the following May, the figures had risen to 64 and 28, respectively.

At Eastern Air Command, Gen. Stratemeyer had a status comparable to that of Stilwell. Coordinating the efforts of the various allied air components while maintaining relations with diverse command structures proved a daunting task. Part of Stratemeyer&#x27;s command, the Tenth Air Force, had been integrated with the RAF Third Tactical Air Force in India in December 1943 and was tasked with a number of roles in support of a variety of allied forces. Another component, the US Fourteenth Air Force in China, was under the jurisdiction of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as China theater commander. Although the India-China Division of the AAF&#x27;s Air Transport Command received its tonnage allocations from Stratemeyer as Stilwell&#x27;s deputy, ICD reported directly to Headquarters ATC in Washington, D.C.

In the spring of 1944, the arrival of Boeing B-29 Superfortresses in the theater, presaged a major offensive against Japan. XX Bomber Command of the Twentieth Air Force was tasked with the strategic bombing of Japan under Operation Matterhorn. It engaged in very-long-range Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombardment operations against Japan, Formosa, China, Indochina and Burma. It reported directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C., and had no command relationship with any authority in India. However, XX Bomber Command remained totally dependent on Eastern Air Command for supplies, bases, ground staff, and infrastructure support. 

The B-29 force included the 1st Photo Squadron, and the 58th Bombardment Wing at Chakulia, Kharagpur, with the 40th (Chakulia Airport), 444th, 462nd, and 468th Bombardment Groups.

While in India, XX BC was supported logistically by Tenth Air Force and the India-China Division, Air Transport Command. The B-29 groups moved to West Field, Tinian, in early 1945.

After a period of reshuffling, Eastern Air Command&#x27;s air operations began to show results. In August 1944, Admiral Mountbatten said to a press conference that EAC fighter missions had practically swept the Japanese air force from Burmese skies. Between the formation of ACSEA in November 1943, and the middle of August 1944, American and British forces operating in Burma destroyed or damaged more than 700 Japanese aircraft with a further 100 aircraft probably destroyed. This achievement considerably reduced dangers to Air Transport Command cargo planes flying in support of the Hump airlift operation. By May 1944, EAC resupply missions in support of the Allied ground offensive had carried 70,000 tons of supplies and transported a total of 93,000 men, including 25,500 casualties evacuated from the battle areas. These figures did not include tonnage flown in the Hump airlift missions to China.

==Timeline==

* Early 1942 Stilwell was promoted to lieutenant general and tasked with establishing the CBI. 
* 25 February 1942 Stilwell arrived in India by which time Singapore and Burma had both been invaded by the Japanese Army.
* 10 March 1942 Stilwell is named Chief of Staff of Allied armies in the Chinese theatre of operations.
* 19 March 1942 Stilwell&#x27;s command in China is extended to include the Chinese 5th and 6th Armies operating in Burma after Chiang Kai-shek gave his permission.
* 20 March 1942 Chinese troops under Stilwell engage Japanese forces along the Sittang River in Burma.
* 9 April 1942 Claire Chennault inducted into U.S. Army as a colonel, bringing the AVG Flying Tigers squadrons under Stilwell&#x27;s nominal authority.
* 16 April 1942 7,000 British soldiers, and 500 prisoners and civilians were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division at Yenangyaung.
* 19 April 1942 The 113th Regiment of the Chinese Expeditionary Force&#x27;s New 38th Division led by General Sun Li-jen attacked and defeated the encircling Japanese troops rescuing the encircled British troops and civilians. This is historically called Battle of Yenangyaung.
* 2 May 1942 The commander of Allied forces in Burma, General Harold Alexander, ordered a general retreat to India. Stilwell left his Chinese troops and began the long evacuation with his personal staff (he called it a &quot;walk out&quot;) to India.
* Most of the Chinese troops, who were supposed to be under Stilwell&#x27;s command, were deserted in Burma without knowledge of the retreat. Under Chiang Kai-shek they made a hasty and disorganised retreat to India. Some of them tried to return to Yunnan through remote mountainous forests and out of these, at least half died.
* 24 May 1942 Stilwell arrived in Delhi.
* New Delhi and Ramgarh became the main training centre for Chinese troops in India. Chiang Kai-shek gave Stilwell command of what was left of the 22nd and 38th Divisions of the Chinese Army.
* 1 December 1942 British General Sir Archibald Wavell, as Commander-in-Chief, India, agreed with Stilwell to make the Ledo Road an American operation.
* August 1943 US creates a jungle commando unit, similar to the Chindits, to be commanded by Major General Frank Merrill; it is informally called &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;.
* Exhaustion and disease led to the early evacuation of many Chinese and American troops before the coming assault on Myitkyina.
* 21 December Stilwell assumed direct control of operations to capture Myitkyina, having built up forces for an offensive in Northern Burma.
* 24 February 1944 Merrill&#x27;s Marauders, attacked the Japanese 18th Division in Burma. This action enabled Stilwell to gain control of the Hakawing Valley.
* 17 May 1944 British general Slim in command of the Burma Campaign handed control of the Chindits to Stilwell.
* 17 May 1944 Chinese troops, with the help of Merrill&#x27;s Marauders, captured Myitkina airfield.
* 3 August 1944 Myitkina fell to the Allies. The Marauders had advanced 750 miles and fought in five major engagements and 32 skirmishes with the Japanese Army. They lost 700 men, only 1,300 Marauders reached their objective and of these, 679 had to be hospitalized. This included General Merrill who had suffered a second-heart attack before going down with malaria.
* Some time before 27 August 1944, Mountbatten supreme allied commander (SEAC) ordered General Stilwell to evacuate all the wounded Chindits.
* During 1944 the Japanese in Operation Ichi-Go overran US air bases in eastern China. Chiang Kai-shek blamed Stilwell for the Japanese success, and pressed the US high command to recall him.
* October 1944 Roosevelt recalled Stilwell, whose role was split (as was the CBI):
** Lieutenant General Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia.
** Major General Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to &quot;Chiang Kai-shek&quot; and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT).
** Lieutenant General Daniel Sultan was promoted from deputy commander to become commander of US Forces India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the Northern Combat Area Command
*12 January 1945, the first convoy over the Ledo Road of 113 vehicles led by General Pick from Ledo reached Kunming, China on 4 February 1945. Over the next seven months 35,000 tons of supplies in 5,000 vehicles were carried along it.

<text>Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive type of medical imaging in which the electrical conductivity, permittivity, and impedance of a part of the body is inferred from surface electrode measurements and used to form a tomographic image of that part. Electrical conductivity varies considerably among various types of biological tissues or due to the movement of fluids and gases within tissues. The majority of EIT systems apply small alternating currents at a single frequency, however, some EIT systems use multiple frequencies to better differentiate between normal and suspected abnormal tissue within the same organ.

Typically, conducting surface electrodes are attached to the skin around the body part being examined. Small alternating currents are applied to some or all of the electrodes, the resulting equipotentials being recorded from the other electrodes. This process will then be repeated for numerous different electrode configurations and finally result in a two-dimensional tomogram according to the image reconstruction algorithms used.

Since free ion content determines tissue and fluid conductivity, muscle and blood will conduct the applied currents better than fat, bone or lung tissue. This property can be used to construct images. However, in contrast to linear x-rays used in computed tomography, electric currents travel three dimensionally along all the paths simultaneously, weighted by their conductivity (thus primarily along the path of highest conductivity, but not exclusively). Image construction can be difficult because there is usually more than one solution for a three-dimensional area projected onto a two-dimensional plane.

Mathematically, the problem of recovering conductivity from surface measurements of current and potential is a non-linear inverse problem and is severely ill-posed. The mathematical formulation of the problem is due to Alberto Calderón, and in the mathematical literature of inverse problems it is often referred to as &quot;Calderón&#x27;s inverse problem&quot; or the &quot;Calderón problem&quot;. There is extensive mathematical research on the problem of uniqueness of solution and numerical algorithms for this problem.

Compared to the tissue conductivities of most other soft tissues within the human thorax, lung tissue conductivity is approximately five-fold lower, resulting in high absolute contrast. This characteristic may partially explain the amount of research conducted in EIT lung imaging. Furthermore, lung conductivity fluctuates intensely during the breath cycle which accounts for the immense interest of the research community to use EIT as a bedside method to visualize inhomogeneity of lung ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients. EIT measurements between two or more physiological states, e.g. between inspiration and expiration, are therefore referred to as time difference EIT (td-EIT).

Time difference EIT (td-EIT) has one major advantage over absolute EIT (a-EIT): inaccuracies resulting from interindividual anatomy, insufficient skin contact of surface electrodes or impedance transfer can be dismissed because most artifacts will eliminate themselves due to simple image subtraction in td-EIT. This is most likely the reason why, as of today, the greatest progress of EIT research has been achieved with time difference EIT.

Further EIT applications proposed include detection/location of cancer in skin, breast, or cervix, localization of epileptic foci, imaging of brain activity. as well as a diagnostic tool for impaired gastric emptying. Attempts to detect or localize tissue pathology within normal tissue usually rely on multifrequency EIT (MF-EIT), also termed Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and are based on differences in conductance patterns at varying frequencies.

==History==
The invention of EIT as a medical imaging technique is usually attributed to John G. Webster and a publication in 1978, although the first practical realization of a medical EIT system was detailed in 1984 due to the work of David C. Barber and Brian H. Brown. Together, Brown and Barber published the first Electrical Impedance Tomogram in 1983, visualizing the cross section of a human forearm by absolute EIT. Even though there has been substantial progress in the meantime, most a-EIT applications are still considered experimental. However, two commercial f-EIT devices for monitoring lung function in intensive care patients have been introduced just recently.

A technique similar to EIT is used in geophysics and industrial process monitoring – electrical resistivity tomography. In analogy to EIT, surface electrodes are being placed on the earth, within bore holes, or within a vessel or pipe in order to locate resistivity anomalies or monitor mixtures of conductive fluids. Setup and reconstruction techniques are comparable to EIT. In geophysics, the idea dates from the 1930s. Electrical resistivity tomography has also been proposed for mapping the electrical properties of substrates and thin films for electronic applications.

==Theory==

Electrical conductivity and permittivity vary among biological tissue types and depend on their free ion content. Further factors affecting conductivity include temperature and other physiological factors, e.g. the respiratory cycle between in- and expiration when lung tissue becomes more conductive due to lower content of insulating air within its alveoli.

After positioning surface electrodes through adhesive electrodes, an electrode belt or a conductive electrode vest around the body part of interest, alternating currents of typically a few milliamperes at a frequency of 10–100 kHz will be applied across two or more drive electrodes. The remaining electrodes will be used to measure the resulting voltage. The procedure will then be repeated for numerous &quot;stimulation patterns&quot;, e.g. successive pairs of adjacent electrodes until an entire circle has been completed and image reconstruction can be carried out and displayed by a digital workstation that incorporates complex mathematical algorithms and &quot;a priori&quot; data.

The current itself is applied using current sources, either a single current source switched between electrodes using a multiplexer or a system of voltage-to-current converters, one for each electrode, each controlled by a digital-to-analog converter. The measurements again may be taken either by a single voltage measurement circuit multiplexed over the electrodes or a separate circuit for each electrode. Earlier EIT systems still used an analog demodulation circuit to convert the alternating voltage to a direct current level before running it through an analog-to-digital converter. Newer systems convert the alternating signal directly before performing digital demodulation. Depending on indication, some EIT systems are capable of working at multiple frequencies and measuring both magnitude and phase of the voltage. Voltages measured are passed on to a computer to perform image reconstruction and display. The choice of current (or voltage) patterns affects the signal-to-noise ratio significantly. With devices capable of feeding currents from all electrodes simultaneously (such as ACT3) it is possible to adaptively determine optimal current patterns.

If images are to be displayed in real time a typical approach is the application of some form of regularized inverse of a linearization of the forward problem or a fast version of a direct reconstruction method such as the D-bar method. Most practical systems used in the medical environment generate a &#x27;difference image&#x27;, i.e. differences in voltage between two time points are left-multiplied by the regularized inverse to calculate an approximate difference between permittivity and conductivity images. Another approach is to construct a finite element model of the body and adjust the conductivities (for example using a variant of Levenburg–Marquart method) to fit the measured data. This is more challenging as it requires an accurate body shape and the exact position of the electrodes.

Much of the fundamental work underpinning Electrical Impedance was done at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute starting in the 1980s. See also the work published in 1992 from the Glenfield Hospital Project (reference missing).

Absolute EIT approaches are targeted at digital reconstruction of static images, i.e. two-dimensional representations of the anatomy within the body part of interest. As mentioned above and unlike linear x-rays in Computed Tomography, electric currents travel three-dimensionally along the path of least resistivity, which results in partial loss of the electric current applied (impedance transfer, e.g. due to blood flow through the transverse plane). This is one of the reasons why image reconstruction in absolute EIT is so complex, since there is usually more than just one solution for image reconstruction of a three-dimensional area projected onto a two-dimensional plane. Another difficulty is that given the number of electrodes and the measurement precision at each electrode, only objects bigger than a given size can be distinguished. This explains the necessity of highly sophisticated mathematical algorithms that will address the inverse problem and its ill-posedness.

Further difficulties in absolute EIT arise from inter- and intra-individual differences of electrode conductivity with associated image distortion and artifacts. It is also important to bear in mind that the body part of interest is rarely precisely rotund and that inter-individual anatomy varies, e.g. thorax shape, affecting individual electrode spacing. &quot;A priori&quot; data accounting for age-, height- and gender-typical anatomy can reduce sensitivity to artifacts and image distortion. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio, e.g. by using active surface electrodes, further reduces imaging errors. Some of the latest EIT systems with active electrodes monitor electrode performance through an extra channel and are able to compensate for insufficient skin contact by removing them from the measurements. Another potential solution to problem with electrode-skin contact is contactless EIT technique which uses voltage excitation and capacitive coupling instead of direct contact with the skin. Capacitively coupled electrodes are more comfortable for the patient but maintaining a constant and equal coupling capacitance for all electrodes is challenging in real measurements. 

Time difference EIT bypasses most of these issues by recording measurements in the same individual between two or more physiological states associated with linear conductivity changes. One of the best examples for this approach is lung tissue during breathing due to linear conductivity changes between inspiration and expiration which are caused by varying contents of insulating air during each breath cycle. This permits digital subtraction of recorded measurements obtained during the breath cycle and results in functional images of lung ventilation. One major advantage is that relative changes of conductivity remain comparable between measurements even if one of the recording electrodes is less conductive than the others, thereby reducing most artifacts and image distortions. However, incorporating &quot;a priori&quot; data sets or meshes in difference EIT is still useful in order to project images onto the most likely organ morphology, which depends on weight, height, gender, and other individual factors.

The open source project EIDORS
provides a suite of programs (written in Matlab / GNU Octave) for data reconstruction and display under the GNU GPL license. The direct nonlinear D-bar method for nonlinear EIT reconstruction is available in Matlab code at .

The Open Innovation EIT Research Initiative is aimed at advancing the development of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in general and to ultimately accelerate its clinical adoption. A plug-and-play EIT hardware and software package was available through Swisstom until 2018.

==Properties==
In contrast to most other tomographic imaging techniques, EIT does not apply any kind of ionizing radiation. Currents typically applied in EIT are relatively small and certainly below the threshold at which they would cause significant nerve stimulation. The frequency of the alternating current is sufficiently high not to give rise to electrolytic effects in the body and the Ohmic power dissipated is sufficiently small and diffused over the body to be easily handled by the body&#x27;s thermoregulatory system. These properties qualify EIT to be continuously applied in humans, e.g. during mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU).
Because the equipment needed in order to perform EIT is much smaller and less costly than in conventional tomography, EIT qualifies for continuous real time visualization of lung ventilation right at the bedside.
EIT&#x27;s major disadvantage versus conventional tomography is its lower maximum spatial resolution (approximately 15% of electrode array diameter in EIT compared to 1 mm in CT and MRI). However, resolution can be improved using 32 instead of 16 electrodes. Image quality can be further improved by constructing an EIT system with active surface electrodes, which significantly reduce signal loss, artifacts, and interferences associated with cables as well as cable length and handling.
In contrast to spatial resolution, temporal resolution of EIT (0.1 milliseconds) is much higher than in CT or MRI (0.1 seconds).

==Applications==

===Lung (a-EIT, td-EIT)===
EIT is particularly useful for monitoring lung function because lung tissue resistivity is five times higher than most other soft tissues in the thorax. This results in high absolute contrast of the lungs. In addition, lung resistivity increases and decreases several-fold between inspiration and expiration which explains why monitoring ventilation is currently the most promising clinical application of EIT since mechanical ventilation frequently results in ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI). The feasibility of EIT for lung imaging was first demonstrated at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1990 using the NOSER algorithm. Time difference EIT can resolve the changes in the distribution of lung volumes between dependent and non-dependent lung regions and assist in adjusting ventilator settings to provide lung protective ventilation to patients during critical illness or anesthesia.

Most EIT studies have focused on monitoring regional lung function using the information determined by time difference EIT (td-EIT). However absolute EIT (a-EIT) also has the potential to become a clinically useful tool for lung imaging, as this approach would allow one to directly distinguish between lung conditions which result from regions with lower resistivity (e.g. hemothorax, pleural effusion, atelectasis, lung edema) and those with higher resistivity (e.g. pneumothorax, emphysema).

The above image shows an EIT study of a 10-day-old baby breathing normally with 16 adhesive electrodes applied to the chest.

Image reconstruction from absolute impedance measurements requires consideration of the exact dimensions and shape of a body as well as the precise electrode location since simplified assumptions would lead to major reconstruction artifacts. While initial studies assessing aspects of absolute EIT have been published, this area of research has not yet reached the level of maturity which would make it suitable for clinical use.

In contrast, time difference EIT determines relative impedance changes that may be caused by either ventilation or changes of end-expiratory lung volume. These relative changes are referred to a baseline level, which is typically defined by the intra-thoracic impedance distribution at the end of expiration.
Time difference EIT images can be generated continuously and right at the bedside. These attributes make regional lung function monitoring particularly useful whenever there is a need to improve oxygenation or CO2 elimination and when therapy changes are intended to achieve a more homogenous gas distribution in mechanically ventilated patients. EIT lung imaging can resolve the changes in the regional distribution of lung volumes between e.g. dependent and non-dependent lung regions as ventilator parameters are changed. Thus, EIT measurements may be used to guide specific ventilator settings to maintain lung protective ventilation for each patient.

Besides the applicability of EIT in the ICU, first studies with spontaneously breathing patients reveal further promising applications. The high temporal resolution of EIT allows regional assessment of common dynamic parameters used in pulmonary function testing (e.g. forced expiratory volume in 1 second). Additionally, specially developed image fusion methods overlaying functional EIT-data with morphological patient data (e.g. CT or MRI images) may be used to get a comprehensive insight into the pathophysiology of the lungs, which might be useful for patients with obstructive lung diseases (e.g. COPD, CF).

After many years of lung EIT research with provisional EIT equipment or series models manufactured in very small numbers, three commercial systems for lung EIT have entered in the medical technology market: Timpel Medical - ENLIGHT 2100, Dräger&#x27;s PulmoVista® 500 and Sentec&#x27;s LuMon EIT. The models are currently being installed in intensive care units and are already used as aides in decision-making processes related to the treatment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The increasing availability of commercial EIT systems in ICUs will show whether the promising body of evidence obtained from animal models will apply to humans as well (EIT-guided lung recruitment, selection of optimum PEEP levels, pneumothorax detection, prevention of ventilator associated lung injury (VALI), etc.). This would be highly desirable, given that recent studies suggest that 15% of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU will develop acute lung injury (ALI) with attendant progressive lung collapse and which is associated with a reportedly high mortality of 39%. Just recently, the first prospective animal trial on EIT-guided mechanical ventilation and outcome could demonstrate significant benefits in regard to respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and histological signs of ventilator-associated lung injury.

In addition to visual information (e.g. regional distribution of tidal volume), EIT measurements provide raw data sets that can be used to calculate other helpful information (e.g. changes of intrathoracal gas volume during critical illness) – however, such parameters still require careful evaluation and validation.

Another interesting aspect of thoracic EIT is its ability to record and filter pulsatile signals of perfusion. Although promising studies have been published on this topic, this technology is still at its beginnings. A breakthrough would allow simultaneous visualization of both regional blood flow and regional ventilation – enabling clinicians to locate and react upon physiological shunts caused by regional mismatches of lung ventilation and perfusion with associated hypoxemia.

===Breast (MF-EIT)===
EIT is being investigated in the field of breast imaging as an alternative/complementary technique to mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for breast cancer detection. The low specificity of mammography and of MRI result in a relatively high rate of false positive screenings, with high distress for patients and cost for healthcare structures. Development of alternative imaging techniques for this indication would be desirable due to the shortcomings of the existing methods: ionizing radiation in mammography and the risk of inducing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with decreased renal function by administering the contrast agent used in breast MRI, Gadolinium.

Literature shows that the electrical properties differ between normal and malignant
breast tissues, setting the stage for cancer detection through determination of electrical properties.

An early commercial development of non-tomographic electrical impedance imaging was the T-Scan device which was reported to improve sensitivity and specificity when used as an adjunct to screening mammography. A report to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) describes a study involving 504 subjects where the sensitivity of mammography was 82%, 62% for the T-Scan alone, and 88% for the two combined. The specificity was 39% for mammography, 47% for the T-Scan alone, and 51% for the two combined.

Several research groups across the world are actively developing the technique. A frequency sweep seems to be an effective technique for detecting breast cancer using EIT.

United States Patent US 8,200,309 B2 combines electrical impedance scanning with magnetic resonance low frequency current density imaging in a clinically acceptable configuration not requiring the use of gadolinium chelate enhancement in magnetic resonance mammography.

===Cervix (MF-EIT)===
In addition to his pioneering role in the development of the first EIT systems in Sheffield professor Brian H. Brown is currently active in the research and development of an electrical impedance spectroscope based on MF-EIT. According to a study published by Brown in 2000, MF-EIT is able to predict [Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia] (CIN) grades 2 and 3 according to Pap smear with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% each. Whether cervical MF-EIT is going to be introduced as an adjunct or an alternative to the Pap smear has yet to be decided. Brown is academic founder of Zilico Limited which distributes the spectroscope (ZedScan I). The device received EC certification from its Notified Body in 2013 and is currently being introduced into a number of clinics in the UK and healthcare systems across the globe.

===Brain (a-EIT, td-EIT, mf-EIT)===
EIT has been suggested as a basis for brain imaging to enable detection and monitoring of cerebral ischemia, haemorrhage, and other morphological pathologies associated with impedance changes due to neuronal cell swelling, i.e. cerebral hypoxemia and hypoglycemia.

While EIT&#x27;s maximum spatial resolution of approximately 15% of the electrode array diameter is significantly lower than that of cerebral CT or MRI (about one millimeter), temporal resolution of EIT is much higher than in CT or MRI (0.1 milliseconds compared to 0.1 seconds). This makes EIT also interesting for monitoring normal brain function and neuronal activity in intensive care units or the preoperative setting for localization of epileptic foci by telemetric recordings.

Holder was able to demonstrate in 1992 that changes of intracerebral impedance can be detected noninvasively through the cranium by surface electrode measurements. Animal models of experimental stroke or seizure showed increases of impedance of up to 100% and 10%, respectively.
More recent EIT systems offer the option to apply alternating currents from non-adjacent drive electrodes. So far, cerebral EIT has not yet reached the maturity to be adopted in clinical routine, yet clinical studies are currently being performed on stroke and epilepsy.

In this use EIT depends upon applying low frequency currents above the skull that are around &lt;100 Hz since during neuronal rest at this frequency these currents remain in the extracellular space and therefore unable to enter the intracellular space within neurons. However, when a neuron generates an action potential or is about to be depolarized, resistance of its membrane preventing this will be reduced by eighty-fold. Whenever this happens in a larger numbers of neurons, resistivity changes of about 0.06–1.7 % will result. These changes in resistivity provide a means of detecting coherent neuronal activity across larger numbers of neurons and so the tomographic imaging of neural brain activity.

Unfortunately while such changes are detectable &quot;they are just too small to support reliable production of images.&quot; The prospects of using this technique for this indication will depend upon improved signal processing or recording.

A study reported in June 2011 that Functional Electrical Impedance Tomography by Evoke Response (fEITER) has been used to image changes in brain activity after injection of an anaesthetic. One of the benefits of the technique is that the equipment required is small enough and easy enough to transport so that it can be used for monitoring depth of anesthesia in operating theatres.

===Perfusion (td-EIT)===
Due to its relatively high conductivity, blood may be used for functional imaging of perfusion in tissues and organs characterized by lower conductivities, e.g. to visualize regional lung perfusion. Background of this approach is that pulsatile tissue impedance changes according to differences in the filling of blood vessels between systole and diastole, particularly when injecting saline as contrasting agent.

===Sports medicine / home care (a-EIT, td-EIT)===
Electrical impedance measurements may also be used to calculate abstract parameters, i.e. nonvisual information. Recent advances in EIT technology as well as the lower number of electrodes required for recording global instead of regional parameters in healthy individuals can be used for non-invasive determination of e.g. VO2 or arterial blood pressure in sports medicine or home care.

==Commercial systems==

===a-EIT and td-EIT===
Even though medical EIT systems had not been used broadly until recently, several medical equipment manufacturers have been supplying commercial versions of lung imaging systems developed by university research groups. The first such system is produced by Maltron International who distribute the &quot;Sheffield Mark 3.5&quot; system with 16 electrodes. Similar systems are the &quot;Goe MF II system&quot; developed by the University of Göttingen, Germany and distributed through CareFusion (16 electrodes) as well as the &quot;Enlight 1800&quot; developed at the University of São Paulo School of Medicine and the Polytechnic Institute of the University of São Paulo, Brazil which is distributed by Timpel SA (Adult Belt Reusable - 32 electrodes; Pediatric Belt Reusable - 24 electrodes; Neonatal Belt Disposable - 16 electrodes).  Timpel Medical has now released their second generation ENLIGHT 2100 and is the only FDA cleared electrical impedance tomography device commercially available in the United States. 
These systems typically comply with medical safety legislation and have been primarily employed by clinical research groups in hospitals, most of them in critical care.

The first EIT device for lung function monitoring designed for everyday clinical use in the critical care environment has been made available by Dräger Medical in 2011 – the &quot;PulmoVista® 500&quot; (16-electrode system). Another commercial EIT system designed for monitoring lung function in the ICU setting is based on 32 active electrodes and was first presented at 2013&#x27;s annual ESICM congress – the &quot;LuMon EIT&quot;. Sentec&#x27;s &quot;LuMon EIT&quot; was released to the market at 2014&#x27;s International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (ISICEM).

===Timpel Medical===
New strategies in artificial ventilation began to be developed through a research project, led by Marcelo Amato MD, PhD, University of São Paulo pulmonologist, between 2002 and 2008. These new ventilation strategies drove the need for innovation that would allow real-time visualization of ventilation and the individualization of treatment at the bedside. With this objective in mind, Timpel was created in 2004. In the same year, Dr Amato and his Team published the article “Imbalances in Regional Lung Ventilation: A Validation Study on Electrical Impedance Tomography” in the renowned ATS Journal, the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine otherwise known as the Blue Journal. 
This was just the beginning of the journey. Amato’s research Team published more than 30 articles about EIT from 2004 to 2023. This research has contributed to the many tools available with EIT today. Because of the tremendous interest in EIT and the value the technology brings to the bedside, researchers around the world have contributed to the body of evidence with more than 250 peer reviewed publications in press by 2022.
Timpel&#x27;s name is derived from the technology (Electric Impedance Tomography) written in reverse. El – electrical; Imp – impedance; T-tomography.
Timpel is passionate and motivated: to make EIT a valuable adjunctive tool for lung protective strategies contributing to the next generation methodology of treating critically ill patients at the bedside. 
With Timpel’s ENLIGHT, electrical impedance tomography device each patient’s care is individualized based on their lung disease. ENLIGHT gives the Clinicians visibility of the ventilation disease profile in real time, at the bedside without the added risk of transportation.

===MF-EIT===
Multifrequency-EIT (MF-EIT) or electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) systems are typically designed to detect or locate abnormal tissue, e.g. precancerous lesions or cancer. 
Impedance Medical Technologies manufacture systems based on designs by the Research Institute of Radioengineering and Electronics of the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow, that are aimed especially at breast cancer detection. 
Texas-based Mirabel Medical Systems, Inc. develops a similar solution for non-invasive detection of breast cancer and offers the &quot;T-Scan 2000ED&quot;. Zilico Limited distributes an electrical impedance spectroscope named &quot;ZedScan I&quot; as a medical device supposed to aid cervical intraepithelial neoplasia location/diagnosis. The device just received EC certification in 2013.

===V5R===
The v5r is a high performance device, based upon a voltage-voltage measurement technique, designed to improve process control. The high frame rate of the v5r (over 650 frames per second) means that it can be used to monitor rapidly evolving processes or dynamic flow conditions. The data it provides can be used to determine the flow profile of complex multiphase processes; allowing engineers to discriminate between laminar flow, plug flow and other important flow conditions for deeper understanding and improved process control.

When used for concentration measurements, the ability to measure full impedance across a wide range of phase ratios means the v5r is able to deliver considerable accuracy across a wider conductivity range compared to other devices.

<text>David Baldacci (born August 5, 1960) is an American novelist. An attorney by education, Baldacci writes mainly suspense novels and legal thrillers.

==Early life and education==
David Baldacci was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia. He is of Italian descent. He graduated from Henrico High School and earned a B.A. in political science from Virginia Commonwealth University and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law, after which he practiced law for nine years in Washington, D.C.

==Career==
Baldacci began writing stories as a child, when his mother gave him a notebook in which to record them. He wrote for more than two decades, penning short stories and later screenplays without much success.

While practicing law, he turned to novel writing, taking three years to write &quot;Absolute Power&quot;. Published in 1996, it was an international best-seller. To date, Baldacci has published 50 novels for adults as well as seven novels for younger readers.

==Personal life and philanthropy==
Baldacci resides in Fairfax County, Virginia, with his family. He has a daughter and a son.

Baldacci and his wife, Michelle, are the co-founders of the Wish You Well Foundation, which works to combat illiteracy in the United States by funding adult literacy programs. Baldacci became involved with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society after his sister, author Sharon Baldacci, was diagnosed with MS.

Baldacci has served for more than a decade on the board of trustees of the Mark Twain House &amp; Museum in Hartford, Connecticut. In 2019, he donated $1 million to the home.

==Works==
Baldacci&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, tells the story of a fictional American president and his Secret Service agents who are willing to commit murder in order to cover up the accidental death of a woman with whom the President was having an affair. It was adapted as a film, &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997), starring Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman.

Baldacci wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of his novel &quot;Wish You Well&quot;; the movie was shot on location in southwest Virginia with Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn, Josh Lucas, and Mackenzie Foy in the lead roles.

Baldacci was a consulting producer on &quot;King &amp; Maxwell&quot;, a TNT television series based on his characters Sean King and Michelle Maxwell. Jon Tenney and Rebecca Romijn starred.

&quot;The Christmas Train&quot;, Baldacci&#x27;s eighth novel, was adapted in 2017 by Hallmark Channel as a Hallmark Hall of Fame feature presentation. The TV movie starred Dermot Mulroney, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Danny Glover and Joan Cusack and was directed by Ron Oliver.

Baldacci&#x27;s novel &quot;One Summer&quot; was adapted in 2021 for Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries and starred Sam Page, Sarah Drew and Amanda Schull.

Baldacci&#x27;s novels have been published in over 45 languages and in more than 80 countries, with over 130 million worldwide sales as of 2018.

<doc id="904069" wikidata="Q8036877" url="?curid=904069" title="Wormleybury">
<text>Wormleybury is an 18th-century house surrounded by a landscaped park of 57 ha (140 acres) near Wormley in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, England, a few miles north of Greater London. The house was rebuilt in the 1770s from an earlier house built in 1734. The house is a Grade I listed building. The garden is well known for its historic rare plant collection. There is a crescent shaped lake in the grounds, bordered by woods on three sides.

==History==
The estate of Wormleybury, originally known as Wormley Bury, was one of several estates which King Harold endowed and granted to the Canons of Waltham Abbey (Waltham Holy Cross). In 1220 the Canons of Waltham constructed a conduit for carrying water from Wormley to the monastery.

A house was built on the site in 1525, just north of the present building. The first house&#x27;s owner was Edward Sharnebrook. Wormley Bury was in the Abbey&#x27;s possession until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, between 1536 and 1541. Afterwards, the estate was granted to Edward North and his heirs. North, Treasurer of the Court of Augmentations, at once alienated it to William Woodliffe or Woodcliffe, mercer of London. He died in 1548, and one half came to one of his two daughters, Ann, who married John Purvey. North sold the other half of the manor to Elizabeth Woodcliffe. The house was subsequently bequeathed to William Woodcliffe. John Purvey was succeeded by a son, William Purvey, who appears to have been in possession of the reunited manor in 1597. It then passed to the Tookes, descendants of the other sister, until it was sold to Richard Woollaston, who died in 1691. Richard Woollaston conveyed the manor to William Fellowes, whose eldest son, Coulston Fellowes, was the possessor in 1728.

From the latter, the manor passed in 1733 by sale to John Deane.. The sixteenth century house was replaced by a new house built in 1734 by John Deane who sold it in 1739 to Alexander Hume (1693–1765).

Sir Abraham Hume, 1st Baronet (1703–1772), inherited the estate from his brother Alexander when he died in 1765. Architect, Robert Mylne supervised the house remodel from 1767 to 1769, and from 1781 to 1782, after Abraham&#x27;s son, Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet (1749–1838) inherited the estate after his father&#x27;s death in 1772. The interior decoration of the house was supervised by Robert Adam from 1777 to 1779. Adam also designed the garden buildings for the estate. The drawing room has painted roundels by Angelica Kauffman.

In 1838, after the 2nd baronet died without male issue, the Wormleybury estate passed to the male children of his daughter Sophia, Lady Brownlow, the wife of Brownlow Cust, 1st Baron Brownlow (1744–1807) (Viscount Alford and the Hon. Charles Henry Cust). They sold it in 1853 to Henry John Grant, on whose death it passed to his widow, Mary Grant. In 1880, Under the will of H. J. Grant, the manor passed to his cousin, Henry Jeffreys Bushby, and then to his son, Mr. Henry North Grant Bushby. The late Sir Whittaker Ellis took a lease of the property, and did a good deal to modernise the house. On his death, this long lease was purchased by Mr. Albert Pam.

The estate then passed through several owners, and is currently divided into flats. The house is a Grade I listed building.

==Park and garden==
The 2nd baronet and his wife Lady Amelia (1751–1809) were well known among leading horticulturalists during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, both in England and abroad. With the help of their gardener, James Mean, they established many exotic plant species in the gardens and greenhouses at Wormleybury. They introduced into England, between 1785 and 1825, a large collection of rare plants, primarily from India and the Far East. In 1793 British botanist James Sowerby made some of his observations of exotic mushrooms in the hothouses and greenhouses of Wormleybury as detailed in his 1796 illustrated book &quot;&#x27;Coloured figures of English fungi or mushrooms&quot;.&#x27; The tropical species &quot;Leucocoprinus birnbaumii&quot;, commonly known as the plantpot dapperling, was observed growing here and was likely introduced along with these exotic plant species. 
Botanist James Edward Smith, along with other notable botanists at the time, discussed the Humes&#x27;s contribution to English horticulture in their publications. Many new plant species were first cultivated at Wormleybury after they arrived in England. According to Smith, in his volume, &quot;Exotic Botany&quot;, &quot;Dr. Roxburgh ... has sent Lady Hume a fine young tree of this species, &quot;Dellinia speciosa&quot;, Malabar, which is now in a very thriving state. It is presumed to be the first ever brought alive to Europe&quot;. The Humes introduced the first white pomegranate (&quot;Punica granatum&quot; fl. Alba) in England in 1796, and the &#x27;Maiden&#x27;s Blush&#x27; (&quot;Camellia japonica&quot;) and the large Mandarin orange (&quot;Citrus nobilis&quot;) in 1805.
The Hume&#x27;s most important introduction, the first Tea Rose from China, &#x27;Hume&#x27;s Blush Tea Scented China Rose&#x27; (&quot;Rosa odorata&quot;) was planted at Wormleybury in 1810&quot;.

Wormleybury is listed Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

<doc id="904073" wikidata="Q668284" url="?curid=904073" title="Gbe languages">
<text>The Gbe languages (pronounced ) form a cluster of about twenty related languages stretching across the area between eastern Ghana and western Nigeria. The total number of speakers of Gbe languages is between four and eight million. The most widely spoken Gbe language is Ewe (10.3 million speakers in Ghana and Togo), followed by Fon (5 million, mainly in Benin). The Gbe languages were traditionally placed in the Kwa branch of the Niger–Congo languages, but more recently have been classified as Volta–Niger languages. They include five major dialect clusters: Ewe, Fon, Aja, Gen (Mina), and Phla–Pherá.

Most of the Gbe peoples came from the east to their present dwelling-places in several migrations between the tenth and the fifteenth century. Some of the Phla–Pherá peoples however are thought to be the original inhabitants of the area who have intermingled with the Gbe immigrants, and the Gen people probably originate from the Ga-Adangbe people in Ghana. In the late eighteenth century, many speakers of Gbe were enslaved and transported to the New World: it is believed that Gbe languages played some role in the genesis of several Caribbean creole languages, especially Haitian Creole and Sranantongo (Surinamese Creole).

Around 1840, German missionaries started linguistic research into the Gbe languages. In the first half of the twentieth century, the Africanist Diedrich Hermann Westermann was one of the most prolific contributors to the study of Gbe. The first internal classification of the Gbe languages was published in 1988 by H.B. Capo, followed by a comparative phonology in 1991. The Gbe languages are tonal, isolating languages and the basic word order is subject–verb–object.

The Gbe language area is bordered to the west and east by the Volta River in Ghana and the Weme River in Benin. The northern border is between 6 and 8 degrees latitude and the southern border is the Atlantic coast. The area is neighbored mainly by Kwa languages, except for the east and north-east, where Yorùbá is spoken. To the west, Ga–Dangme, Guang and Akan are spoken. To the north, it is bordered by Adele, Aguna, Akpafu, Lolobi, and Yorùbá.

Estimates of the total number of speakers of Gbe languages vary considerably. Capo (1988) gives a modest estimate of four million, while SIL&#x27;s Ethnologue (15th edition, 2005) gives eight million. The most widely spoken Gbe languages are Ewe (Ghana and Togo) and Fon (Benin, eastern Togo) at four million and 3 million speakers, respectively. Ewe is a language of formal education for secondary schools and universities in Ghana, and is also used in non-formal education in Togo. In Benin, Aja (740,000 speakers) and Fon were two of the six national languages selected by the government for adult education in 1992.

===Classification===
Greenberg, following Westermann (1952), placed the Gbe languages in the Kwa family of the Niger–Congo languages. The extent of the Kwa branch has fluctuated through the years, and Roger Blench places the Gbe languages in a Volta–Niger branch with former East Kwa languages to their east.

Gbe is a dialect continuum. Based on comparative research, Capo (1988) divides it into five clusters, with each cluster consisting of several mutually intelligible dialects. The borders between the clusters are not always distinct. The five clusters are:

Kluge (2011) proposes that the Gbe languages consist of a dialect continuum that can be split into three large clusters.

*Western Gbe varieties (Ewe, Gen, and Northwestern Gbe): Adan, Agoi/Gliji, Agu, Anexo, Aveno, Awlan, Be, Gbin, Gen, Kpelen, Kpési, Togo, Vhlin, Vo, Waci, Wance, Wundi (also Awuna?)
*Central Gbe varieties: Aja (Dogbo, Hwe, Sikpi, Tado, Tala)
*Eastern Gbe varieties (Fon, Eastern Phla–Pherá, and Western Phla–Pherá): Agbome, Ajra, Alada, Arohun, Ayizo, Ci, Daxe, Fon, Gbekon, Gbesi, Gbokpa, Gun, Kotafon, Kpase, Maxi, Movolo, Saxwe, Se, Seto, Tofin, Toli, Weme, Xwela, Xwla (Eastern), Xwla (Western) (also Wudu?)

===Naming===
The dialect continuum as a whole was called &#x27;Ewe&#x27; by Westermann, the most influential researcher on the cluster, who used the term &#x27;Standard Ewe&#x27; to refer to the written form of the language. Other linguists have called the Gbe languages as a whole &#x27;Aja&#x27;, after the name of the local language of the Aja-Tado area in Benin. However, use of this single language&#x27;s name for the language cluster as a whole was not only not acceptable to all speakers but also rather confusing. Since the establishment of a working group at the West African Languages Congress at Cotonou in 1980, H. B. Capo&#x27;s name suggestion has been generally accepted: ″&quot;Gbe&quot;″, which is the word for &#x27;language/dialect&#x27; in each of the languages.

==History==

===Before 1600===
Ketu, settlement in present-day Benin Republic (formerly known as Dahomey), might be an appropriate starting point for a brief history of the Gbe-speaking peoples. Ewe traditions refer to Ketu as &quot;Amedzofe&quot; (&quot;origin of humanity&quot;) or &quot;Mawufe&quot; (&quot;home of the Supreme Being&quot;). It is believed that the inhabitants of Ketu were pressed westward by a series of wars between the tenth and the thirteenth century. In Ketu, the ancestors of the Gbe-speaking peoples separated themselves from other refugees and began to establish their own identity.

Attacks between the thirteenth and the fifteenth century drove a large section of the group still further westward. They settled in the ancient kingdom of Tado (also Stado or Stádó) on the Mono river (in present-day Togo). The Tado kingdom was an important state in West Africa up to the late fifteenth century.

In the course of the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the Notsie (or Notsé, Notsye, Wancé) kingdom was established by emigrants from the Tado kingdom; Notsie would later (around 1500) become the home of another group of migrants from Tado, the Ewe people. Around 1550, emigrants from Tado established the Allada (or Alada) kingdom, which became the center of the Fon people. Tado is also the origin of the Aja people; in fact, the name Aja-Tado (Adja-Tado) is frequently used to refer to their language.
Aja is considered the mother tribe by the rest of Gbe speaking people as many of the tribes trace their migration routes through Aja Tado(formerly known as Azame).

Other peoples that speak Gbe languages today are the Gen people (Mina, Ge) around Anexo, who are probably of Ga and Fante origin, and the Phla and Pherá peoples, some of whom consist of the traditional inhabitants of the area intermingled with early migrants from Tado.

===European traders and the transatlantic slave trade===
Little is known of the history of the Gbe languages during the time that only Portuguese, Dutch and Danish traders landed on the Gold Coast (roughly 1500 to 1650). The trade of mostly gold and agricultural goods did not exercise much influence on social and cultural structures of the time. No need was felt to investigate the indigenous languages and cultures; the languages generally used in trade at this time were Portuguese and Dutch. Some loanwords remain from this period, for example &quot;atrapoe&quot; &#x27;stairs&#x27; from Dutch &quot;trap&quot; and &quot;duku&quot; &#x27;(piece of) cloth&#x27; from Dutch &quot;doek&quot; or Danish &quot;dug&quot;. The few written accounts that stem from this period focus on trade. As more European countries established trade posts in the area, missionaries were sent out. As early as 1658, Spanish missionaries translated the &quot;Doctrina Christiana&quot; into the language of Allada, making it one of the earliest texts in any West African language. The Gbe language used in this document is thought to be a somewhat mangled form of Gen.

The relatively peaceful situation was profoundly changed with the rise of the transatlantic slave trade, which reached its peak in the late eighteenth century when as many as 15,000 slaves per year were exported from the area around Benin as part of a triangular trade between the European mainland, the west coast of Africa and the colonies of the New World (notably the Caribbean). The main actors in this process were Dutch (and to a lesser extent English) traders; captives were supplied mostly by cooperating coastal African states.

The Bight of Benin, precisely the area where the Gbe languages are spoken, was one of the centers of the slave trade at the turn of the eighteenth century. The export of 5% of the population each year resulted in overall population decline. Moreover, since the majority of the exported captives were male, the slave trade led to an imbalance in the female/male ratio. In some parts of the Slave Coast the ratio reached two adult women for every man. Several wars (sometimes deliberately provoked by European powers in order to divide and rule) further distorted social and economical relations in the area. The lack of earlier linguistic data makes it difficult to trace the inevitable linguistic changes that resulted from this turbulent period.

===Colonisation and onwards===
Around 1850, the transatlantic slave trade had virtually ceased. As the grip of European colonial powers strengthened, slave raiding became prohibited, trading focused on goods once more and the Europeans took it to be their calling to Christianize the colonized parts of Africa. In 1847 the Norddeutsche Missions-Gesellschaft (Bremen) started its work in Keta.

In 1857, the first Ewe grammar, &quot;Schlüssel der Ewesprache, dargeboten in den Grammatischen Grundzügen des Anlodialekts&quot;, was published by missionary J. B. Schlegel of the Bremen mission. Five different dialects of Gbe (at that time called the &quot;Ewé Language-Field&quot;) were already distinguished by Schlegel, notes Robert Needham Cust in his &quot;Modern Languages of Africa&quot; (1883). The dialects listed by Cust do not map exactly onto the five subgroups now distinguished by Capo, which is not too surprising since Cust himself admits that he relies on a multitude of often conflicting sources. Fon is in fact listed twice (once as &#x27;the dialect of the province of Dahomé&#x27; and once as &#x27;Fogbe&#x27;).

Where previous literature consisted mostly of travel journals sometimes accompanied by short word lists, Schlegel&#x27;s work marked the beginning of a period of prolific lexicographic and linguistic research into the various Gbe languages. Important writers of this period include Johann Gottlieb Christaller (&quot;Die Volta-Sprachen-Gruppe&quot;, 1888), Ernst Henrici (&quot;Lehrbuch der Ephe-Sprache&quot;, 1891, actually the first comparative Gbe grammar), J. Knüsli (&quot;Ewe-German-English Vocabulary&quot;, 1892) and Maurice Delafosse (&quot;Manuel Dahoméen&quot; (Fon), 1894).

In 1902 the missionary Diedrich Hermann Westermann contributed an article titled &quot;Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Yewe-Sprachen in Togo&quot; to &quot;Zeitschrift für Afrikanische und Oceanische Sprachen&quot;. Westermann became one of the most productive and influential writers on the Gbe languages, and his output dominated the Gbe literature and analysis of the first half of the twentieth century. He wrote mainly on the Western Gbe languages, especially on Ewe (though he often used the term &#x27;Ewe&#x27; to denote the Gbe dialect continuum as a whole). Among his most important works on Ewe are his &quot;A Study of the Ewe language&quot; (1930) and &quot;Wörterbuch der Ewe-Sprache&quot; (1954).

===&quot;Renaissance du Gbe&quot;===

From 1930 on, publications on various Gbe languages appeared rapidly, the vast majority of them dealing with individual Gbe languages. A significant exception is formed by the extensive comparative linguistic research of Hounkpati B Christophe Capo, which resulted in an internal classification of the Gbe languages and a reconstruction of the proto-Gbe phonology. Much of the comparative research for Capo&#x27;s classification of the Gbe languages was carried out in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the form of articles on specific phonological developments in various branches of Gbe and, notably, in the form of a unified standard orthography of Gbe. In his &quot;Renaissance du Gbe&quot; (1988), the internal classification of Gbe was published in full for the first time. In 1991, Capo published a comparative phonology of Gbe. In this period, Capo also initiated &quot;Labo Gbe (Int.)&quot;, the &#x27;Laboratory for research on Gbe languages&#x27;, based in Benin, which has since fostered research and published several collections of papers on the Gbe languages.

In the early 1990s, SIL International initiated a study to assess which Gbe communities could benefit from existing literacy efforts and whether additional literacy campaigns in some of the remaining communities would be needed. Synchronised linguistic research carried out in the course of this study shed more light on the relations between the various varieties of Gbe. In general, the SIL studies corroborated many of Capo&#x27;s findings and led to adjustment of some of his more tentative groupings.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The following phonetic segments are attested in Gbe languages:
&quot;Notes&quot;
*The apico-postalveolar consonants are generally written and transcribed with the symbols for the corresponding alveolar consonants, except for the voiced stop, which uses the symbol for the voiced retroflex stop . This is only to distinguish it from the lamino-dental voiced stop, and is not to be interpreted as the consonant being subapical.
*The above table lists the attested &quot;phonetic&quot; segments. Some of the sounds listed here are in free variation with other sounds (e.g. r and r̃ with l and l̃). The reader is referred to the individual languages for an overview of their phoneme inventory.

No Gbe language exhibits all of the above forty-two phonetic segments. According to Capo (1991), all of them have the following twenty-three consonants in common: b, m, t, d, ɖ, n, k, g, kp, gb, ɲ, f, v, s, z, χ, ʁ, r, r̃, l, l̃, y, w.

===Vowels===
The following vowels are found in Gbe languages:

In general, each Gbe variety makes use of a subset of twelve vowels, seven oral and five nasalised. The vowels are attested in all Gbe languages.

Nasalization plays an important role in the vowel inventory: every vowel in the Gbe languages occurs in a non-nasalized and a nasalized form. Capo (1991) observes that the degree of nasality of nasal vowels is less when they occur after nasal consonants than after non-nasal ones.

===Nasalization in Gbe===
Capo (1981) has argued that nasalization in Gbe languages should be analyzed phonemically as a feature relevant to vowels and not to consonants. This means that nasal vowels are distinct from oral vowels, while nasal and voiced oral stops are treated as predictable variants. For example, non-syllabic nasal consonants are always followed by a nasal vowel, and syllabic nasal consonants are analyzed as reduced forms of consonant–vowel syllables. This analysis is in line with reconstructions of the proto-Volta–Congo language, for which similar proposals have been made.

===Tone===
The Gbe languages are tonal languages. In general, they have three tone levels, High (H), Mid (M), and Low (L), of which the lower two are not phonemically contrastive. Thus, the basic tonemes of Gbe are &#x27;High&#x27; and &#x27;Non-High&#x27;, where the High toneme may be realised as High or Rising and the Non-High toneme may be realised as Low or Mid. The tones of Gbe nouns are often affected by the consonant of the noun stem. The voicing of this consonant affects the realisation of the Non-High toneme roughly as follows: If the consonant is a voiced obstruent, the Non-High toneme is realised as Low (è-ḏà &#x27;snake&#x27;) and if the consonant is a voiceless obstruent or a sonorant, the Non-High toneme is realised as Mid (ām̲ē &#x27;person&#x27;, à-f̱ī &#x27;mouse&#x27;). The consonants that induce tonal alternations in this way are sometimes called depressor consonants.

===Morphology===
The basic syllable form of Gbe languages is commonly rendered (C1)(C2)V(C3), meaning that there at least has to be a nucleus V, and that there are various possible configurations of consonants (C1-3). The V position may be filled by any of the vowels or by a syllabic nasal. It is also the location of the tone. While virtually any consonant can occur in the C1 position, there exist several restrictions on the kind of consonants that can occur in the C2 and C3 positions. In general, only liquid consonants may occur as C2 , while only nasals occur in the C3 position.

Most verbs in Gbe languages have one of the basic syllable forms. Gbe nominals are generally preceded by a nominal prefix consisting of a vowel (cf. the Ewe word &#x27;, &#x27;tooth&#x27;). The quality of this vowel is restricted to the subset of non-nasal vowels. In some cases the nominal prefix is reduced to schwa or lost: the word for &#x27;fire&#x27; is &quot;izo&quot; in Phelá, &#x27; in Wací-Ewe and &quot;&quot; in Pecí-Ewe. The nominal prefix can be seen as a relic of a typical Niger–Congo noun class system.

The Gbe languages are isolating languages, and as such express many semantic features by lexical items. Of a more agglutinative nature are the commonly used periphrastic constructions. In contrast to Bantu languages, a major branch of the Niger–Congo language family, Gbe languages have very little inflectional morphology. There is for example no subject–verb agreement whatsoever in Gbe, no gender agreement, and no inflection of nouns for number. The Gbe languages make extensive use of a rich system of tense/aspect markers.

Reduplication is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word, or part of it, is repeated. The Gbe languages, like most Kwa languages, make extensive use of reduplication in the formation of new words, especially in deriving nouns, adjectives and adverbs from verbs. Thus in Ewe, the verb &quot;lã́&quot;, &#x27;to cut&#x27;, is nominalised by reduplication, yielding &quot;lãlã́&quot;, &#x27;the act of cutting&#x27;. Triplication is used to intensify the meaning of adjectives and adverbs, e.g. Ewe &quot;ko&quot; &#x27;only&#x27; → &quot;kokooko&quot; &#x27;only, only, only&#x27;.

==Grammar==
The basic word order of Gbe clauses is generally subject–verb–object, except in the imperfective tense and some related constructions. The Gbe languages, notably Ewe, Fon and Anlo, played a role in the genesis of several Caribbean creole languages—Haitian Creole for example is classifiable as having a French vocabulary with the syntax of a Gbe language.

The Gbe languages do not have a marked distinction between tense and aspect. The only tense that is expressed by a simple morphological marker in Gbe languages is the &quot;future tense&quot;. The future marker is &quot;ná&quot; or &quot;a&quot;, as can be seen from the examples below.

Other tenses are arrived at by means of special time adverbs or by inference from the context, and this is where the tense/aspect distinction becomes blurred. For example, what is sometimes referred to as &quot;perfective aspect&quot; in Gbe blends with the notion of past tense since it expresses an event with a definite endpoint, &quot;located in the past&quot; (see example sentences below).


Focus, which is used to draw attention to a particular part of the utterance, to signify contrast or to emphasize something, is expressed in Gbe languages by leftward movement of the focused element and by way of a focus marker &quot;wɛ́&quot; (Gungbe, Fongbe), &quot;yé&quot; (Gengbe) or &quot;é&quot; (Ewegbe), suffixed to the focused element.

Questions can be constructed in various ways in Gbe languages. A simple declarative sentence can be turned into an interrogative utterance by the use of the question marker &quot;à&quot; at the end of the sentence. Another way of forming questions is by using question words. These so-called &quot;question word questions&quot; are much akin to focus constructions in Gbe. The question word is found at the beginning of the sentence, as is the focus marker. The close relationship to focus is also clear from the fact that in Gbe, a sentence cannot contain a question word and a focused element simultaneously.


Topicalization, the signalling of the subject that is being talked about, is achieved in Gbe languages by the move of the topicalized element to the beginning of the sentence. In some Gbe languages, a topic marker is suffixed to the topicalized element. In other Gbe languages the topic has to be &quot;definite&quot;. A topicalized element precedes the focused element in a sentence containing both.

Negation is expressed in various ways in the Gbe languages. In general, three methods of negation can be distinguished: Languages like Gungbe express negation by a preverbal marker &quot;má&quot;; Fongbe-type languages express negation either like Gungbe, or with a sentence-final marker &quot;ã&quot;; and languages like Ewegbe require both the preverbal marker &quot;mé&quot; and a sentence-final marker &quot;o&quot;.

Gbe languages share an areal feature found in many languages of the Volta basin, the serial verb construction. This means that two or more verbs can be juxtaposed in one clause, sharing the same subject, lacking conjunctive markings, resulting in a meaning that expresses the consecutive or simultaneous aspect of the actions of the verbs.

<text>Laure Manaudou (; born 9 October 1986) is a retired French Olympic, world and European champion swimmer. She has held the world record in freestyle events between 200 and 1500 meter. She is the older sister of Florent Manaudou who is also an Olympic gold medalist swimmer.

==Career==

===2004 Olympics===
She won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s 400-meter freestyle at the 2004 Athens Olympics. It was France&#x27;s first gold medal ever in women&#x27;s swimming and the first swimming gold medal won by a French athlete since Jean Boiteux&#x27;s victory in the 400-meter men&#x27;s freestyle event at Helsinki in 1952. Manaudou won the silver medal in the women&#x27;s 800-meter freestyle at the Athens Olympics. In that race, she had a quick start but was passed down the stretch by Ai Shibata of Japan. She also won the bronze medal in the women&#x27;s 100-meter backstroke, thus becoming only the 2nd Frenchwoman to win three medals in a single Olympic Games, Summer or Winter. The first one was the track and field athlete Micheline Ostermeyer in London in 1948. Manaudou was by far the best swimmer on the French team, but she did not have the team support to win a medal in the women&#x27;s 4×200 m freestyle relay.

Manaudou is currently tied for third (three medals altogether) on the all-time list of French multiple female Winter or Summer Olympic medal winners along with Micheline Ostermeyer, Marielle Goitschel, Pascale Trinquet-Hachin, Perrine Pelen, Anne Briand-Bouthiaux, Marie-José Pérec, Félicia Ballanger and Camille Muffat. The all-time leader is the fencer Laura Flessel-Colovic, who has five Olympic medals.

===2004 European Championships===
Laure Manaudou won three gold medals at the 2004 European Swimming Championships in Madrid, Spain, in the 100-metre backstroke, 400-metre freestyle, and the 4×100-metre medley relay.

===2005 World Championships===
On 24 July 2005 at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Canada, Manaudou won the women&#x27;s 400-m freestyle. Manaudou was under world record pace for the first half of the race. In the second half of the race, Manaudou was challenged by Shibata, her rival from the Olympics. Pundits were already predicting that Manaudou would eventually eclipse the world-record mark in the 400-m freestyle set by Janet Evans at the 1988 Summer Olympics. This would happen on 12 May 2006, as she broke Evans&#x27;s world record of 4:03.85 during the final of the French championship in Tours with the time of 4:03.03.

===2006 European Championships===
On 12 May 2006, Manaudou broke Janet Evans&#x27;s world record in the women&#x27;s 400-meter freestyle swim that had stood for 18 years. Manaudou then held the same world record for nearly two years.

On 6 August 2006, on the final day of the 2006 European Swimming Championships in Budapest, she broke her own world record with a time of 4:02.13 in winning the 400-m freestyle title. She also won the 800-m freestyle (in European record time), 200-m individual medley and 100-m backstroke titles. In addition, she obtained the bronze medal in the 200-m freestyle, 4×200-m team freestyle and 4×100-m team medley. With her four titles, she equalled the record of the number of individual titles won in the same European swimming championships held by East Germany&#x27;s Ute Geweniger (1981) and Hungary&#x27;s Krisztina Egerszegi (1993).

===2007 World Championships===
Manaudou broke the 200-m freestyle world record at the 2007 World Swimming Championships in Melbourne in winning the final. She also won the 400-m freestyle event. She obtained silver medals in the 100-m backstroke and the 800-m freestyle, and a bronze for 4×200-m freestyle relay. In the 100-m backstroke, she became the second woman in history to swim under a minute in the event. She was leading the race in the 800-m final going into the last lap, but the American Kate Ziegler finally overtook her in the last metres to win by a margin of 28 cm. She was thus prevented from becoming the first female swimmer to win the 200-m, 400-m and 800-m freestyle titles at the same World Championships.

===2008 Olympics===
In the 2008 Summer Olympics, Manaudou was unable to recapture her form from the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. After starting strong and holding the lead at the 200-meter mark, she finished last (eighth) in the 400-m freestyle final with a finishing time of 4:11.26. After the defeat, Manaudou admitted giving up during the race after struggling to keep up. She then finished seventh in the 100-m backstroke final. In her final hope for a medal, in the 200-m backstroke, she finished last in her semifinal heat and was eliminated.

===Retirement and comeback===
On 17 September 2009, at 22 years of age, Manaudou announced through the newspaper &quot;Le Parisien&quot; her retirement from competitive swimming. She was quoted as saying, &quot;It came to me little by little. I didn’t make it on impulse. It has matured slowly.&quot;
In October 2010, she returned to training in the United States with the Auburn University Tigers swim team. She made her return to competition on July 14, 2011, in Tigers colours at a small swimming meet in Athens, Georgia, in the United States, where
she set a personal record in the 50-m freestyle event (25.84 s).

===2012 Olympics===
Manaudou competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in three events – 100 m backstroke, 200 m backstroke, and the 4 × 100 m medley relay. She failed to advance from the first round heats in all the three events. However, she was poolside on August 3 as her younger brother Florent won a surprise victory in the men&#x27;s 50 m freestyle final, and embraced him following his victory.

==Personal life==
The weekly magazine &quot;Paris Match&quot; ran a cover story on Manaudou in its 5–11 April 2007 issue.

Manaudou is now dating Fréro Delavega singer Jérémy Frérot, with whom she has two sons, and also a daughter from a previous relationship with Frédérick Bousquet.

==Accomplishments==
Between June 2004 and April 2008, Manaudou remained unbeaten in the 400-metre freestyle, winning 23 finals in succession.

<doc id="904114" wikidata="Q6785110" url="?curid=904114" title="Master aircrew">
<text>Master aircrew (MAcr) is the warrant-officer rank held by aircrew in the Royal Air Force. It is equivalent to warrant officer in other trades, and is effectively the highest non-commissioned aircrew rank. It has a NATO rank code of OR-9.

People holding this rank used to be referred to by different titles depending on their specialisation: 
* Master Signaller (MSig)
* Master Engineer (MEng)
* Master Air Electronics Operator (MAEOp)
* Master Air Loadmaster (MALM). 

This rank is the sole survivor of a system of separate ranks for aircrew which existed between 1 July 1946 and 1950 (another system for technical staff existed between 1950 and 1964). Other designations, such as master pilot and master navigator, once existed, but now these specialisations are only held by officers.

The badge of rank is a small version of the Royal Arms (as worn by a warrant officer) with an eagle below, all surrounded by a wreath. Master aircrew receive a warrant signed by the Secretary of State for Defence.

==New Zealand==
The Royal New Zealand Air Force used the rank until June 2007 when the Master Aircrew rank reverted to Warrant Officer.

<text>Caveman is a 1981 slapstick comedy film written and directed by Carl Gottlieb and starring Ringo Starr, Dennis Quaid, Shelley Long and Barbara Bach. The film is set in prehistoric times and revolves around the rivalries between cavemen.

==Plot==
Atouk is a bullied and scrawny caveman living in &quot;One Zillion BC – October 9th&quot;. He lusts after the beautiful but shallow Lana, who is the mate of Tonda, their tribe&#x27;s physically imposing bullying leader and brutish instigator. After being banished along with his friend Lar, Atouk falls in with a band of assorted misfits, among them the comely Tala and the elderly blind man Gog. The group has ongoing encounters with hungry dinosaurs, and rescues Lar from a &quot;nearby ice age&quot;, where they encounter an abominable snowman. In the course of these adventures, they discover sedative drugs and fire, invent cooking, music, and weapons, and learn how to walk fully upright. Atouk uses these advances to lead an attack on Tonda, overthrowing him and becoming the tribe&#x27;s new leader. He rejects Lana and takes Tala as his mate, and they live happily ever after.

* Hector Moreno as Noota
* Pamela Gual as Noota&#x27;s Mate

==Production==
Filming was mostly done in the Sierra de Órganos National Park in the town of Sombrerete in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. The river and fishing lake scene was shot in the Mexican state of Durango, and some scenes were filmed at the Churubusco Studios in Mexico City. The film features stop motion animated dinosaurs constructed by Jim Danforth, including a &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot; which in one scene becomes intoxicated by a cannabis-type drug, animated by Randall W. Cook. Danforth was a major participant in the special effects sequences, but left the film &quot;about two-thirds of the way&quot; (his words) through the work because the Directors Guild of America prohibited his contracted on-screen credit, co-direction with Carl Gottlieb. Consequently, Danforth&#x27;s name does not appear on the film.

The film&#x27;s dialog is almost entirely in &quot;caveman&quot; language, such as:
* &quot;aiyee&quot; – help
* &quot;alunda&quot; – love
* &quot;bobo&quot; – friend
* &quot;caca&quot; – shit
* &quot;gluglug&quot; – drowned
* &quot;guwi&quot; – out to get
* &quot;haraka&quot; – fire
* &quot;kuda&quot; – come
* &quot;macha&quot; – monster
* &quot;nya&quot; – no/not
* &quot;ool&quot; – food
* &quot;pooka&quot; – broken/pain
* &quot;ugh&quot; – like
* &quot;ya&quot; – yes
* &quot;zug zug&quot; – sex/mate

At some showings audiences were issued a translation pamphlet for 30 &quot;caveman words.&quot; The only English dialog present is used for comedic effect, when it is spoken by a caveman played by Evan Kim who speaks modern English but is understood by none of the other characters. Being a Korean caveman, by speaking English, he appears to be more advanced than the rest. At her audition, Long said she did not speak any English, but responded to everything with grunts.

Barbara Bach and Ringo Starr first met on the set of &quot;Caveman&quot;, and they married just over a year later.

==Home media==
The film was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on June 4, 2002. It was then released on February 17, 2015 on Blu-ray Disc by Olive Films.

==Reception==

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 21 critics, with an average rating of 4.7/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 55% based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4. The cast was &quot;interesting&quot;, he wrote, but the main failing of &quot;Caveman&quot; was it being a spoof with &quot;no popular original material for it to satirize. There has never been a really successful movie set in prehistoric times.&quot; Ebert and Gene Siskel both gave the film a negative &quot;don&#x27;t see it&quot; review on their TV show but softened their criticism somewhat by noting that its dinosaur-related sequences were amusing.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;dopey, but it&#x27;s also lots of fun&quot;, and that the real star was the special-effects dinosaur. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker gave it a positive review, calling it &quot;a funky, buoyant farce.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave it a mixed review. He was critical with the lack of originality but suggests younger audiences who have not seen it before may enjoy it. Arnold compares the film unfavorably to &quot;Three Ages&quot;: where Buster Keaton was able to bring his genius to that picture, &quot;Caveman&quot; struggles to overcome Starr&#x27;s limits, and director Gottlieb fails to make use of other talented actors such as Quaid, Schreiber, or Gilford.

<text>The Ledo Road () () was an overland connection between British India and China, built during World War II to enable the Western Allies to deliver supplies to China and aid the war effort against Japan. After the Japanese cut off the Burma Road in 1942 an alternative was required, hence the construction of the Ledo Road. It was renamed the Stilwell Road, after General Joseph Stilwell of the U.S. Army, in early 1945 at the suggestion of Chiang Kai-shek. It passes through the Burmese towns of Shingbwiyang, Myitkyina and Bhamo in Kachin state. Of the long road, are in Burma and in China with the remainder 61 km was in India. The road had the Ledo-Pangsau Pass-Tanai (Danai)-Myitkyina--Bhamo-Mansi-Namhkam-Kunming route.

To move supplies from the railheads to the Army fronts, three all-weather roads were constructed in record time during the autumn (fall) of 1943: Ledo Road in the north across three nations, which went on to connect to the Burma Road and supply China; the campaign-winning Central Front road within India from Dimapur to Imphal; and the southern road from Dohazari south of Chittagong in British India for the advance of troops to Arakan in Myanmar.

In the 19th century, British railway builders had surveyed the Pangsau Pass, which is high on the India-Burma border, on the Patkai crest, above Nampong, Arunachal Pradesh and Ledo, Tinsukia (part of Assam). They concluded that a track could be pushed through to Burma and down the Hukawng Valley. Although the proposal was dropped, the British prospected the Patkai Range for a road from Assam into northern Burma. British engineers had surveyed the route for a road for the first . After the British had been pushed back out of most of Burma by the Japanese, building this road became a priority for the United States. After Rangoon was captured by the Japanese and before the Ledo Road was finished, the majority of supplies to the Chinese had to be delivered via airlift over the eastern end of the Himalayan Mountains known as the Hump.

After the war, the road fell into disuse. In 2010, the BBC reported &quot;much of the road has been swallowed up by jungle.&quot;

==Construction==
On 1 December 1942, British General Sir Archibald Wavell, the supreme commander of the Far Eastern Theatre, agreed with American General Stilwell to make the Ledo Road an American NCAC operation. The Ledo Road was intended to be the primary supply route to China and was built under the direction of General Stilwell from the railhead at Ledo, Assam, in India, to Mong-Yu road junction where it joined the Burma Road. From there trucks could continue on to Wanting on the Chinese frontier, so that supplies could be delivered to the reception point in Kunming, China. Stilwell&#x27;s staff estimated that the Ledo Road route would supply 65,000 tons of supplies per month, greatly surpassing tonnage then being airlifted over the Hump to China. General Claire Lee Chennault, the USAAF Fourteenth Air Force commander, thought the projected tonnage levels were overly optimistic and doubted that such an extended network of trails through difficult jungle could ever match the amount of supplies that could be delivered with modern cargo transport aircraft.

The road was built by 15,000 American soldiers (60 percent of whom were African-Americans) and 35,000 local workers at an estimated cost of US$150 million (or $2 billion 2017). The costs also included the loss of over 1,100 Americans lives, as many died during the construction, as well as the loss of many locals&#x27; lives. The human cost of the 1,079 mile road was therefore described as &quot;A Man A Mile&quot;. As most of Burma was in Japanese hands it was not possible to acquire information as to the topography, soils, and river behaviour before construction started. This information had to be acquired as the road was constructed.

General Stilwell had organized a &#x27;Service of Supply&#x27; (SOS) under the command of Major General Raymond A. Wheeler, a high-profile US Army engineer and assigned him to look after the construction of the Ledo Road. Major General Wheeler, in turn, assigned responsibility of base commander for the road construction to Colonel John C. Arrowsmith. Later, he was replaced by Colonel Lewis A. Pick, an expert US Army engineer.

Work started on the first section of the road in December 1942. The road followed a steep, narrow trail from Ledo, across the Patkai Range through the Pangsau Pass (nicknamed &quot;Hell Pass&quot; for its difficulty), and down to Shingbwiyang, Burma. Sometimes rising as high as , the road required the removal of earth at the rate of . Steep gradients, hairpin curves and sheer drops of , all surrounded by a thick rain forest was the norm for this first section. The first bulldozer reached Shingbwiyang on 27 December 1943, three days ahead of schedule.

The building of this section allowed much-needed supplies to flow to the troops engaged in attacking the Japanese 18th Division, which was defending the northern area of Burma with their strongest forces around the towns of Kamaing, Mogaung, and Myitkyina. Before the Ledo road reached Shingbwiyang, Allied troops (the majority of whom were American-trained Chinese divisions of the X Force) had been totally dependent on supplies flown in over the Patkai Range. As the Japanese were forced to retreat south, the Ledo Road was extended. This was made considerably easier from Shingbwiyang by the presence of a fair weather road built by the Japanese, and the Ledo Road generally followed the Japanese trace. As the road was built, two fuel pipe lines were laid side-by-side so that fuel for the supply vehicles could be piped instead of trucked along the road.

After the initial section to Shingbwiyang, more sections followed: Warazup, Myitkyina, and Bhamo, from Ledo. At that point the road joined a spur of the old Burma road and, although improvements to further sections followed, the road was passable. The spur passed through Namkham from Ledo and finally at the Mong-Yu road junction, from Ledo, the Ledo Road met the Burma Road. To get to the Mong-Yu junction the Ledo Road had to span 10 major rivers and 155 secondary streams, averaging one bridge every .

For the first convoys, if they turned right, they were on their way to Lashio to the south through Japanese-occupied Burma. If they turned left, Wanting lay to the north just over the China-Burma border. However, by late 1944, the road still did not reach China; by this time, tonnage airlifted over the Hump to China had significantly expanded with the arrival of more modern transport aircraft.

In late 1944, barely two years after Stilwell accepted responsibility for building the Ledo Road, it connected to the Burma Road though some sections of the road beyond Myitkyina at Hukawng Valley were under repair due to heavy monsoon rains. It became a highway stretching from Assam, India to Kunming, China length. On 12 January 1945, the first convoy of 113 vehicles, led by General Pick, departed from Ledo; they reached Kunming, China on 4 February 1945. In the six months following its opening, trucks carried 129,000 tons of supplies from India to China. Twenty-six thousand trucks that carried the cargo (one way) were handed over to the Chinese.

As General Chennault had predicted, supplies carried over the Ledo Road at no time approached tonnage levels of supplies airlifted monthly into China over the Hump. However, the road complemented the airlifts. The capture of the Myitkyina airstrip enabled the Air Transport Command &quot;to fly a more southerly route without fear of Japanese fighters, thus shortening and flattening the Hump trip with astonishing results.&quot; In July 1943 the air tonnage was 5,500 rising to 8,000 in September and 13,000 in November. After the capture of Myitkyina deliveries jumped from 18,000 tons in June 1944 to 39,000 in November 1944.

In July 1945, the last full month before the end of the war, 71,000 tons of supplies were flown over the Hump, compared to only 6,000 tons using the Ledo Road; the airlift operation continued in operation until the end of the war, with a total tonnage of 650,000 tons compared to 147,000 for the Ledo Road. By the time supplies were flowing over the Ledo Road in large quantities, operations in other theaters had shaped the course of the war against Japan.

When flying over the Hukawng Valley during the monsoon, Mountbatten asked his staff the name of the river below them. An American officer replied, &quot;That&#x27;s not a river, it&#x27;s the Ledo Road.&quot;
== American Army units assigned to the Ledo Road ==
The units initially assigned to the initial section were:
* 45th Engineer General Service Regiment (An African-American Unit)
* 823rd Aviation Engineer Battalion (EAB) (An African-American Unit)
In 1943 they were joined by:
* 848th EAB (An African-American Unit)
* 849th EAB (An African-American Unit)
* 858th EAB (An African-American Unit)
* 1883rd EAB (An African-American Unit)
* 236th Combat Engineer Battalion
* 1875th Combat Engineer Battalion

From the middle of April until the middle of May 1944 Company A of the 879th Airborne Engineer Battalion worked 24 hours a day on the Ledo Road, construction of their base camp and Shingbwiyang airfield, before deploying to Myitkyina to improve the facilities of an old British airfield recently recaptured from the Japanese.

Work continued through 1944 in late December it was opened for the transport of logistics. In January 1945, four of the black EABs (along with three white battalions) continued working on the now renamed &quot;Stilwell Road&quot;, improving and widening it. Indeed, one of these African American units was assigned the task of improving the road that extended into China.

==Comments on the construction of the road==
Winston Churchill called the project &quot;an immense, laborious task, unlikely to be finished until the need for it has passed&quot;.

The British Field Marshal William Slim who commanded the British Fourteenth Army in India/Burma wrote of the Ledo Road:
==Post World War II==

After Burma was liberated, the road gradually fell into disrepair. In 1955 the Oxford-Cambridge Overland Expedition drove from London to Singapore and back. They followed the road from Ledo to Myitkyina and beyond (but not to China). The book &quot;First Overland&quot; written about this expedition by Tim Slessor (1957) reported that bridges were down in the section between Pangsau Pass and Shingbwiyang. In February 1958 the Expedition of Eric Edis and his team also used the road from Ledo to Myitkyina en route to Rangoon, Singapore and Australia. Ten months later they returned in the opposite direction. In his book about this expedition &quot;The Impossible Takes a Little Longer&quot;, Edis (2008) reports that they have removed a yellow sign with India/Burma on it from the Indian/Burmese border and that they have donated it to the Imperial War Museum in London. For many years, travel into the region was also restricted by the Government of India. Because of continuous clashes between insurgents (who were seeking shelter in Burma) and the Indian Armed Forces, India imposed harsh restrictions between 1962 and the mid-1990s on travel into Burma.

Since an improvement in relations between India and Myanmar, travel has improved and tourism has begun near Pangsayu Pass (at the Lake of No Return). Recent attempts to travel the full road have met with varying results. At present the Nampong-Pangsau Pass section is passable in four-wheel drive vehicles. The road on the Burmese side is now reportedly fit for vehicular traffic. Donovan Webster reached Shingbwiyang on wheels in 2001, and in mid-2005 veterans of the Burma Star Association were invited to join a &quot;down memory lane&quot; trip to Shingbwiyang organised by a politically well-connected travel agent. These groups successfully travelled the road but none made any comment on the political or human rights situation on Burma afterward.

Burmese from Pangsau village saunter nonchalantly across Pangsau Pass down to Nampong in India for marketing, for the border is open despite the presence of insurgents on both sides. There are Assam Rifles and Burma Army posts at Nampong and Pangsau respectively. But the rules for locals in these border areas do not necessarily apply to westerners. The governments of both countries keep careful watch on the presence of westerners in the border areas and the land border is officially closed. Those who cross without permission risk arrest or problems with smugglers/insurgents in the area.

==Current status==

Currently Stillwell Road (लेडो रोड) runs for connecting Dibrugarh in Assam, India with Kunming in Yunnan, China running through Myanmar. As of 2022, the road from Ledo to Nampong in India was a paved road, with the road going further to Pangsau Pass on India-Myanmar having restricted civilian access. From Pangsau to Tanai was a mud track, from Tanai to Myitkyina was a wide compacted-earth road maintained by a commercial plantation company, the road section from Myitkyina to China border was reconstructed by a Chinese company, from China border to Kunmin is a 6 lane highway.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Burmese government focused on the reconstruction of the Ledo Road as an alternative to the existing Lashio-Kunming Burma Road. The Chinese government completed construction of the Myitkyina-Kambaiti section in 2007. Rangoon-based Yuzana Company constructed the section between Myitkyina and Tanai (Danai) which was already operational in 2011 as the company owns thousands of acres of land there for its multiple crop plantation including sugarcane and cassava. India&#x27;s government, however, fears that the road may be useful to militants in North East India who have hideouts in Myanmar.

In 2010 the BBC described the road as such: &quot;Much of the road has been swallowed up by jungle. It is barely passable on foot and is considered too dangerous to use by many because of the presence of Burmese and Indian ethnic insurgents in the area...At present the road from Myitkyina to the Chinese border – along with the brief Indian section – is usable.&quot;

In 2014, to document the status of the road, photographer Findlay Kember, working on a photo feature for the South China Morning Post, traveled the entire length of the road across three nations on three different trips due to not being allowed to cross the international borders. In India, there is Stilwell park in Lekhapani near Ledo to mark the beginning of the Stilwell road, a World War 2-era cemetery between 
Jairampur and Pangsau Pass for the Chinese soldiers and labourers who built the road, a still existing bridge near Nampong nicknamed &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot; due to treacherous conditions and landslides in the area. In Myanmar, he found villagers using a World War II gas tank as a water tank in Kachin state, and the gravel road between Myitkyina and Tanai was very wide and well used but unpaved. In China, he found World War II trenches in Songshan in Yunnan province which was a site of fierce battles between Japanese defenders and Chinese attackers in June 1944, and a brass relief honoring Chinese and American soldiers in Tengchong in Yunnan. A post went viral in Philippines in 2019 which showed the current picture of 24-zigzag hairpin turns of Stilwell road on a mountain slope in Qinglong County in Guizhou province of China. It turned out to be a photo taken by Findlay Kember on his earlier trip.
In 2015, it was not possible to cross the border on the Ledo Road due to visa restrictions. In 2015, the section from Namyun to Pangsau Pass in Burma was a &quot;heavily rutted muddy track&quot; through the jungle according to a BBC correspondent.

In 2016, Indian Government restored &amp; expanded the Stillwell Road uptill Dibrugarh running through Margherita, Digboi, Tinsukia. Currently the stretch of Stillwell Road is in India &amp; it is the part of Asian Highway 2 or AH2. In India Stilwell Road is known as NH315 from Makum to Pangsu Pass. The stretch between Dibrugarh to Makum falls under NH15. In 2016-17, China called for restoration of Stilwell Road.

<text>Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan. It can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour, but is mostly blended into bulk wines.

The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine, and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine. Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines, it does carry their fruitful essence.

The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California&#x27;s hot climate, specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys. Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural, special acidity.

==History==

Ruby Cabernet is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan created in 1936 by Dr Harold Olmo at UC Davis in California. The intention was to combine Carignan&#x27;s heat tolerance with Cabernet Sauvignon&#x27;s quality, like the Cinsaut x Pinot noir cross that led to Pinotage a few years previously.

==Wine regions==

===Argentina===
A little is grown in Argentina for blending into bulk wines.

===Australia===
Small amounts are grown in the Hunter Valley and Murray-Darling region, disappearing into nondescript blends.
However a few producers take the variety seriously. Andrew McPherson in Victoria uses the variety in several export wines f.x Full Fifteen exported to England and Denmark.

===Brazil===
Vale do São Francisco winery in Pernambuco, Brazilian Northeast region, successfully grows the variety and produces the wine Botticelli Coleção Ruby Cabernet. Vinícola Campos de Cima in Itaqui, Campanha Gaúcha, grows the grape and produces a 100% varietal of the wine Ruby Cabernet.

===Mexico===
Valle De Guadalupe, Baja California (near Ensenada) produces a very nice variety and quality wines. Included is Cabernet Franc - Malbec/Ruby Cabernet. Aguascalientes is also another wine region where wines with this grape are produced.

===Chile===
Some Ruby Cabernet is supposedly grown in Chile, but few wines will admit to it on the label.

===Israel===
A little Ruby Cabernet is used by the Tishbi winery in Zichron Ya&#x27;akov. Some 17 tons were harvested in 2012.

===South Africa===
For a while Ruby Cabernet was thought to hold a lot of promise for the hotter regions of South Africa, but in practice problems with fruit set have limited its success. It is successfully grown in the Robertson district, and forms the main ingredient of the Van Loveren &quot;River Red&quot; blend.

===Spain===
Several DOs on the Islas Canarias include Ruby Cabernet in their authorized list of grape varieties including DO Lanzarote, Tacoronte-Acentejo, Valle de Güímar, and Valle de la Orotava.

===United States===
Ruby Cabernet is mostly planted in California, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley where it adds colour and backbone to bulk wines. Vineyards where farming techniques are employed to maximize quality however can produce wines with exceptional aroma, flavor, and mouth feel.

==Vine and Viticulture==

The vine is very drought resistant, and stands up well to high winds. Poor fruit set has been a problem in South Africa, and it is vulnerable to powdery mildew.
In California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley, vineyards should limit irrigation, thin crop, and expose fruit to the sun to maximize wine quality.

===Vineyard ground===
The vineyards on which grapes for Ruby Cabernet are grown, are seat on vigorous grounds filled with deep clay loam. The canopies on these vineyards are usually quite open and not completely erected. The spacing below the vineyard row is normally of about seven to eight feet for optimal vertical shoot positioning. In case of vineyards which are quadrilateral and divided in a horizontal way, the space must be of about six to seven feet.

<text>Mystery Girl is the twenty-second album by American singer Roy Orbison. It was his last album to be recorded during his lifetime, as he completed the album in November 1988, a month before his death at the age of 52, and it was released posthumously by Virgin Records on January 31, 1989. It includes the hit singles &quot;You Got It&quot;, which was co-written by Orbison and his Traveling Wilburys bandmates Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, and &quot;She&#x27;s a Mystery to Me&quot;, written by Bono and The Edge. The album was a critical and commercial success; it peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, the highest position Orbison had achieved on that chart, and number 2 on the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was Orbison&#x27;s first album of all-new material since 1979 and its success posthumously continued the resurgence that his career had undergone since 1986. Among the many other contributors to the album were Mike Campbell and other members of the Heartbreakers, T Bone Burnett, George Harrison, Jim Keltner and Rick Vito. For the 25th anniversary of its release, the album was reissued with bonus tracks including &quot;The Way Is Love&quot;, a song recorded by Orbison on a cassette tape in the 1980s that was subsequently completed by his sons and producer John Carter Cash.

==Recording==
Before making &quot;Mystery Girl&quot;, Roy Orbison&#x27;s last album of new material had been 1979&#x27;s &quot;Laminar Flow&quot;. This release followed a run of commercial and critical failures in the United States since his years of international stardom in the early 1960s. From 1986, support from admirers such as filmmaker David Lynch and Bruce Springsteen reversed this trend, rescuing him from relative obscurity in his homeland as Orbison again became a popular concert draw. According to &quot;The Authorized Roy Orbison&quot;, recordings for &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; began in July 1987 at Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood with the track &quot;(All I Can Do is) Dream You&quot;. Jeff Lynne, another long-time admirer, began writing songs with Orbison in Los Angeles over Christmas 1987. The track &quot;You Got It&quot; was written at this time and was a collaboration between Lynne, Orbison and Tom Petty. With Lynne as his producer, Orbison recorded &quot;You Got It&quot; in April 1988 at the garage studio of Petty&#x27;s bandmate in the Heartbreakers, Mike Campbell.

Recording for the album continued alongside Orbison&#x27;s involvement in the Traveling Wilburys, a supergroup project initiated by George Harrison and Lynne that also included Petty and Bob Dylan. Aside from further Lynne-produced sessions for &quot;Mystery Girl&quot;, to which Petty and Harrison contributed, Orbison recorded some of the songs with Campbell, T Bone Burnett and his wife Barbara Orbison each in the role of producer. The Heartbreakers played on much of the album, while Elvis Costello contributed the song &quot;The Comedians&quot;.

The album was named after the chorus from the track &quot;She&#x27;s a Mystery to Me&quot;, which was written by U2&#x27;s Bono and The Edge. In the documentary &quot;In Dreams: The Roy Orbison Story&quot;, Bono says he woke up for a concert soundcheck, following a late night listening to the soundtrack to Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, and had the tune of the title song in his head, figuring it was another Orbison song (&quot;In Dreams&quot; was the only Orbison song on that album). During the soundcheck, he performed &quot;She&#x27;s a Mystery to Me&quot; for the other members of U2, who agreed that it sounded like an Orbison song. Orbison later met the band backstage at one of their concerts and subsequently asked Bono if he would like to write a song either with or for him.

Recording for the album was completed in November 1988. Having maintained a busy schedule of concert performances, Orbison told Johnny Cash at this time that he was experiencing chest pains and would need to do something about his health. On December 6, two days after performing a show in Highland Heights, Ohio, Orbison died of a heart attack, at the age of 52.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was Orbison&#x27;s first significant critical and commercial success as a solo artist since the mid-1960s. 
 It was released on January 31, 1989 and followed the Wilburys&#x27; &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot; into the higher reaches of the US albums chart. On April 8, 1989, Orbison became the first deceased musician since Elvis Presley to have two albums in the top five positions in the US, with the Traveling Wilburys album at number 4 and &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; at number 5. This was the highest placing he had achieved for an album in the US, and the single, &quot;You Got It&quot;, which peaked at number 9, was Orbison&#x27;s first top 20 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; in 1964. In the United Kingdom, on the national chart dated to February 11, 1989, &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was listed at number 2 (its peak position there), as the compilation &quot;The Legendary Roy Orbison&quot; was at number 3.

In his contemporary review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, David Silverman lamented that, given the expectations caused by Orbison&#x27;s death, &quot;the publicity and fanfare have threatened to cheapen the album, reducing it to novelty status while directing attention away from its rightful distinction as one of Orbison&#x27;s finest works – a comeback to match his legendary status.&quot; Silverman especially admired &quot;Dream You&quot; and said that the only weak track was &quot;The Comedians&quot;, where &quot;the openly rancorous story&quot; was unsuitable for such &quot;an unrequited romantic&quot; as Orbison. By contrast, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Stephen Holden highlighted &quot;The Comedians&quot; as the album&#x27;s &quot;outstanding song&quot;, saying that it was a &quot;witty parody&quot; of Orbison&#x27;s 1961 hit &quot;Running Scared&quot; that the singer had succeeded in transcending from mere homage due to his expressive vocal. Holden added that, throughout &quot;Mystery Girl&quot;, &quot;the singing, songwriting and production do a superb job of bringing Orbison up to date without diluting his haunted hyper-romantic fervor.&quot; The &quot;Deseret News&quot;″ reviewer described it as a &quot;great, great album&quot; that sealed Orbison&#x27;s comeback after the Traveling Wilburys&#x27; recent success and reinforced what a true loss his death was to popular music. The reviewer admired Orbison&#x27;s ability to work effectively with his collaborators and highlighted &quot;You Got It&quot; as an &quot;exceptional single&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Mystery to Me&quot; as &quot;perhaps the best song on the album&quot;. Billboard described the album as &quot;fitting testament to the glory of his voice&quot;

In May 2014, &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was reissued in a 25th anniversary edition. It included bonus material such as demos and a new song, &quot;The Way Is Love&quot;, which was completed by John Carter Cash and Orbison&#x27;s sons from a cassette demo recorded in around 1986.
