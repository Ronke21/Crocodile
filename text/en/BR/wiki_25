<text>International Computers Limited (ICL) was a British computer hardware, computer software and computer services company that operated from 1968 until 2002. It was formed through a merger of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), English Electric Computers (EEC) and Elliott Automation in 1968. The company&#x27;s most successful product line was the ICL 2900 Series range of mainframe computers.

In later years, ICL diversified its product line but the bulk of its profits always came from its mainframe customers. New ventures included marketing a range of powerful IBM clones made by Fujitsu, various minicomputer and personal computer ranges and (more successfully) a range of retail point-of-sale equipment and back-office software. Although it had significant sales overseas, ICL&#x27;s mainframe business was dominated by large contracts from the UK public sector, including Post Office Ltd, the Inland Revenue, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Defence. It also had a strong market share with UK local authorities and (at that time) nationalised utilities including the water, electricity, and gas boards.

The company had an increasingly close relationship with Fujitsu from the early 1980s, culminating in Fujitsu becoming sole shareholder in 1998. ICL was rebranded as Fujitsu in April 2002. Fujitsu (UK) as the hardware and software supplier has been implicated in the British Post Office scandal, which has extended from the 1990s to the 2020s 

The ICL brand is still used by the former Russian joint-venture of the company, founded in 1991.

== Origins ==

International Computers Limited was formed in 1968 as a part of the Industrial Expansion Act of the Wilson Labour Government. ICL was an initiative of Tony Benn, the Minister of Technology, to create a British computer industry that could compete with major world manufacturers like IBM; the formation of the company was the last in a series of mergers that had taken place in the industry since the late 1950s.

The main portions of ICL were formed by merging International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) with English Electric Computers, the latter a recent merger of Elliott Automation with English Electric Leo Marconi computers, which itself had been a merger of the computer divisions of English Electric, LEO and Marconi. Upon its creation, the British government held a 10% stake in the company and provided a $32.4 million research-and-development grant spread across four years.

=== International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) ===

ICT was itself the result of a merger of two UK companies that had competed with each other throughout the 1930s and 1940s during the punched card era: British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) and Powers-Samas. ICT had thus emerged with equipment that would process data encoded on punched cards with 40, 80 or 160 columns, compared to the 64 or 80 columns used by IBM and its predecessors.

In 1962, ICT delivered the first ICT 1300 series computer, its first transistor machine and also the first to use core memory. A small team from Ferranti&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary, Ferranti-Packard, visited the various Ferranti computer labs and saw their work on a next-generation machine. On their return home they quickly produced the Ferranti-Packard 6000, developing the machine, compilers and an operating system (before these were common) and putting it on the market by 1963. A feature of the Executive operating system was its ability to multitask, using dynamic memory allocation enabled with a magnetic drum as an intermediate random access device. The machine went on to have some success and sold in small numbers in Canada (Saskatchewan Power Corporation retired serial number 0004 in early 1982) and the United States.

In 1964, ICT purchased the computer division of Ferranti in another government-forced merger. Ferranti had been building a small number of scientific machines based on various university designs since the 1950s. None of these could be considered commercially successful, however, and Ferranti always seemed to be slow bringing its designs to market.

Meanwhile, ICT management in England was looking to rejuvenate their line-up; their latest developments, the ones used to develop the FP 6000, were still not on the market. Management looked at the FP 6000 as well as licensing the RCA Spectra 70. In the end it was decided to go with the FP 6000 as the basis for a small line of small-to-midrange machines. The result was the ICT 1900 series, which would eventually go on to sell into the thousands.

The 1900 Series, which derived from the Canadian Ferranti-Packard 6000, competed successfully in the UK with the IBM System/360 range from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. The design was based on a 24-bit word, divided up into 6-bit characters. Lower case and control characters were provided for by &quot;shift&quot; characters. The early machines (1904/1905 with hardware floating point) had only 15-bit addressing. Later machines (1904E, 1905E, 1906A) had extended addressing modes, up to 22 bits.

The operating systems (Executives) were

*E4BM – the original for the FP 6000 (known internally as the FP1)
*E4RM – a significantly rewritten version of E4BM, with parts of the operating system overlaid to save space.
*E6BM – a rewritten version of E4BM for the later machines with 22 bit addressing.
*E6RM – a rewritten version of E4RM overlay software for the later machines with 22 bit addressing.

A later development was GEORGE3, remembered with great affection by a generation of British programmers.

A series of smaller machines were developed by the ICL Stevenage operation, consisting initially of the 1901 / 1902 / 1903 systems running E3 series executives (e.g. E3RM) and versions of the GEORGE operating system (initially GEORGE1). Later developments were the 1901A / 1902A / 1903A with their own Executives and GEORGE2.

At a time (in the 1960s and 1970s) when IBM/360 series programs had to be recompiled to run in different machine and/or operating system environments, one significant feature of the 1900 series was that programs would function unaltered on any 1900 system, without the need for recompilation. Unfortunately ICT, and later ICL, were unable to capitalise on this advantage to make significant inroads into IBM&#x27;s customer base.

=== English Electric LEO Marconi (EELM) ===
During the same period, LEO was struggling to produce its own machines that would be able to compete with IBM. Its parent company, J. Lyons and Co., did not have the financial might to develop a new line of machines. Not wanting to see its work go to waste, it sold its computer division to English Electric.

English Electric had developed a series of machines over the years, notably the famous KDF9 and the commercially oriented KDF8, but never had much commercial success.

Now with serious financial backing at its disposal, the new company nevertheless decided not to come up with its own design, and instead licensed the RCA Spectra 70 (the design ICT rejected). The result was the System 4 series. While there were a number of models in the range, the smaller 4/10 and 4/30 were seen as underpowered, and the more successful variants were the larger 4/50 and 4/70 models. A model 4/75 was also supplied to the EELM (later Baric) Bureau subsidiary and installed at Winsford, Cheshire as the hardware for a bureau-developed commercial system for interactive use by bureau customers. Although several multi-user commercial packages (e.g. sales and purchase ledger systems) were developed and tried with customers, this was not commercially successful, and the service was soon withdrawn.

The System 4 series ran the J (for Job) operating system. This was a batch operating system, although there was a variant that allowed interactive access called MultiJob. Under a framework called Driver, J was a successful operating environment for high volume commercial real time systems. Programming languages used were assembler and COBOL and Fortran (an Algol 60 compiler was provided but not used much, if at all). The system was controlled from a console composed of a mechanical printer and keyboard – very like a Teletype. The assembly language (known as Usercode) non-privileged instruction set was identical to IBM System 360 Assembly Language; in privileged mode there were a few extras.

System 4&#x27;s compatibility with the IBM 360 made it particularly attractive to customers in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as the sale and installation of IBM computers (and other American technologies) there was politically sensitive and commercially restricted during the Cold War.

=== Leo computers ===
* LEO computer Leo 3 – origins in J. Lyons and Co.

=== Elliott Automation computers ===
* Elliott 4100 – a joint development with NCR Corporation. Transferred to ICL but sales and development ended soon after the formation of ICL.

The following remained with Elliott Automation and were never included in the formation of ICL:

* Elliott 503 – extensively used for academic and scientific work in British universities
* Elliott 803
* Elliott 901 / 920A
* Elliott 903 / 920B
* Elliott 905 / 920C
* Elliott 920ATC

The 900 series were 18 bit binary computers. The 90x series were commercial machines. The 920x series were built to military specifications and used in military aircraft, mobile field deployed air defence systems and tanks.

== Locations ==

ICL was concentrated in the United Kingdom, with its corporate headquarters in Putney in the London borough of Wandsworth.

At the time of the original merger, the company inherited extensive engineering and manufacturing facilities in West Gorton, Manchester; Castlereagh in Belfast, Stevenage and Croydon from ICT, and from English Electric in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire and Winsford, Cheshire. Manufacture and assembly also took place at several factories in Letchworth Garden City (the original home of the British Tabulating Company) and Croydon.

The company had a large research, operating system and software development and support centre in Bracknell, another smaller one at Dalkeith in Scotland and a software development centre in Adelaide, South Australia, between 1970 and 1973, application development in Reading, and training centres at Moor Hall (Cookham), Beaumont College (Old Windsor) (sales, support and software) and Letchworth (Hertfordshire) (manufacturing &amp; field engineering).

The company also had manufacturing facilities in Park Road Mill, Dukinfield; later replaced by a purpose-built factory at Ashton-under-Lyne.Ashton under-Lyne&#x27;s team was noted for working on numerous mechanical innovations in the field of computer engineering. A state of the art printed circuit board plant was built in Plymouth Grove, Manchester in 1979, however financial troubles within the company forced its closure in 1981. Other offices included a facility at Bridgford House in Nottingham which was the headquarters of Rushcliffe Borough Council, but has since been converted into apartments.

For some years ICL maintained a training and presentation facility for senior management at Hedsor House, near Taplow, Berkshire.

Outside the UK, ICL&#x27;s offices around the world were mainly sales and marketing operations, with some application development for the local market. The exceptions were development and manufacturing sites arising from acquisitions, such as Utica, New York in the United States from the Singer merger, and a variety of former Nokia Data sites in Sweden and Finland.

ICL and its customers often referred to these locations by the Site Code, especially where multiple sites might exist in a town, for instance with the Putney headquarters building (now Putney Wharf Tower) being LON11 (London 11), the training college at Beaumont being WSR01 (Windsor 01) and the southern System Support Centre (SCC) at Bracknell, Berkshire being BRA01 (Bracknell 01). BRA05 was the new headquarters of ICL (UK) Ltd, the company&#x27;s UK sales and customer service division which moved from its original base at Putney Bridge House (LON13) in Fulham, London to a new building in Bracknell in the late 1980s.

== Early products: 1900 Series and System 4 ==
On its formation, the company inherited two main product lines: from ICT the 1900 Series of mainframes, and from English Electric Computers (EEC) the System 4, a range of IBM System/360-compatible mainframe clones, based on the RCA Spectra 70.

, the United Kingdom was unusual in Europe for IBM not having more than 50% of the computer market, although an observer stated that the company constrained the size of its British subsidiary to keep ICL alive. Although still the largest European computer company, in 1971 ICL had a poor reputation. When the companies were first merged the EEC order books were full, while ICT (which had twice as many employees) was struggling, perhaps because it was already obvious that the 1900 series was incompatible with the rest of the industry, with an architecture based on a 24-bit word and 6-bit character rather than the 8-bit byte that was becoming the industry norm.

The new board decided that the 1900 should be phased out in favour of the System 4, but shortly afterwards reversed their decision. It is probable that this was due to union and political pressure from the Wilson government. In any event, most of the original EEC board resigned over the interference as they believed that the 1900 series was doomed from the outset, being incompatible with the rest of the marketplace. ICL initially thrived, but relied almost wholly on supplying the UK public sector with computers. The 1900s were sold in several countries worldwide, but the largest slice of the market was always in the UK, and the largest part of that in government, local authorities, and nationalised industries.

Until the 1970s launch of the 2900 Series, the UK government had a single-tender preferential purchase agreement wherever ICL could meet the requirements.

== New range: 2900 Series ==
Even before the merger that created ICL was complete, a working party had recommended that the new company should develop a new range of machines offering &quot;acceptable compatibility with the current ranges of both companies&quot;. This was also seen as a way to help &quot;achieve company unity&quot; for the newly formed organization. The resulting 2900 Series was launched on 9 October 1974. Its design drew on many sources, one being the Manchester University MU5.

It ran the VME operating systems, and supported emulation of both the earlier architectures (1900 Series and System 4), either standalone (DME, Direct Machine Environment) or concurrently with native-mode operation (CME, Concurrent Machine Environment). In the early 1980s ICL struck a deal to acquire semiconductor technology from Fujitsu, on whom they became increasingly dependent as the years progressed.

The term &quot;New Range&quot; was used during development for the product line that was eventually launched as the 2900 Series, the operating system being known initially as VME/B and later simply as VME. Models included:

* 2950
* 2955
* 2956

* 2960
* 2966
* 2970

* 2972
* 2976
* 2980

* 2982
* 2988
These ran the VME and DME (emulation) operating systems, and were available in both single and multi-processor configurations, the later being known as Duals and SuperDuals (2966 and 2988 only). The company also developed:
* A Content Addressable File Store (CAFS) that could be exploited by the VME file system and ICL 2900 IDMS
* The world&#x27;s first commercially available massively parallel computer, the Distributed Array Processor (DAP), that first ran as an attached processor to the ICL 2980.

=== Series 39 ===
Series 39 followed the same essential architecture as 2900 series, but was a dramatic step forward in hardware technology. It was the first commercial mainframe to exploit optical fibres for central interconnect, and also introduced a multi-CPU (multinode) architecture transparent to the applications.

The series included:
*Level 30
*Level 50
*Level 60
*Level 80

The training video for the Series 39 featured the comedy duo Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry.

ICL received the Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement for the Series 39 in 1988.

=== Operating systems ===
At the inception of New Range development, two operating systems were planned: System B for the large processors, and System D for the mid-range. System B was subsequently renamed VME/B. A third operating system, System T, was subsequently targeted at small machines. System D was dropped in order to focus efforts on VME/B and System T, renamed to VME/K (Confusingly, VME/B was developed in Kidsgrove, VME/K in Bracknell.) The first large machines (the 2980 and 2970) were launched with VME/B. VME/K first saw service on the 2960.

The chief architect of VME/B was Brian Warboys, who subsequently became professor of software engineering at the University of Manchester. VME/B was developed using the pioneering software engineering system CADES as the development environment. The architect of CADES was David Pearson (computer scientist).

VME/K development continued independently for several reasons. Early VME/B customers suffered significant performance and reliability problems, and the existence of an alternative product provided a safety net. Perhaps more significantly, VME/K was the brainchild of Ed Mack, who had been brought in by managing director Geoff Cross as ICL&#x27;s head of research and development. Despite his wide responsibilities, Mack took a detailed personal interest in every aspect of VME/K design. To quote historian Martin Campbell-Kelly, &quot;Mack had a good deal more autonomy than was good for the company.&quot; Not only was too much resource going into VME/K at the expense of the VME/B system that ICL&#x27;s biggest customers were actually using, but the development of mainframe systems was also diverting expenditure from small business systems such as the 2903, whose sales were growing much more rapidly.

ICL&#x27;s finances deteriorated during the late 1970s, leading to the appointment of a new management team led by Robb Wilmot and Peter Bonfield. One of their first actions was to end VME/K development. This happened just at the time that VME/K had finally reached a level of performance and reliability that made it saleable; however, the customer base was very small, and by this time VME/B (which was renamed VME 2900) had also matured sufficiently to give confidence that it would meet the future requirements for the entire mainframe range.

VME 2900 subsequently became simply VME and then Open VME, and continued to evolve. In 1980 it was marketed as &quot;Your system for the 80s&quot;, and indeed that decade proved to be its heyday. It continued to give service to many loyal and demanding users, but has attracted few new users since 1990 or so.

==== Superstructure software ====
ICL used the term &quot;superstructure&quot; to refer to the compilers, data management tools, and transaction processing software sitting above the operating system but below the user application – a category now often labelled middleware.

==== Languages ====
== 2903 range ==
The 2903 range was a rapid development to produce a small business computer to replace the 1901A. As far as possible it was developed from existing hardware and software, but configured for an office environment without underfloor cabling. It was urgently needed to generate a cashflow that would support continuing 2900 development. The hardware was based on the 2900 DFC (Disk File Controller), and used the MICOS engine. The 2903/4 system cabinet housed the MICOS engine, Drico FEDS disk storage and a punched card reader. A wing attached at 45 degrees carried the operator&#x27;s console which was a visual display unit (VDU): for 1900 users who were accustomed to the Westrex teletype as console, this was a major advance. The printers abutted to the wing and were initially integrated; they were soon replaced by the CPI shuttle printer and PBS. The printers ran at 300 or 600 lines per minute, selected by a hidden link.

The 2903 used microcode to emulate 1900 hardware. The operating system was George 1* (a modification of George 1S batch operating system) running on top of the UDAS Executive. In consequence, the 1900 compilers and utilities ran on the 290x range without any changes or recompilation. For some sites a microcode floppy was available that would make the system work as an IBM 360 running the IBM operating system, although this entailed changing the removable hard drives as the formats were completely different.

A new feature provided on this range was Direct Data Entry, a system with up to eight dedicated VDU data entry stations, with which card image files could be created; these could be assigned to a program&#x27;s card reader and processed accordingly.

There were three models in the range:
* 2903
* 2904
* 2905 (limited production, replaced by the 2950)

290x computers would run in an office environment, still quite an innovation for this class of machine, and were a runaway success. Roughly 3,000 systems were sold, ten times as many as ICL had anticipated.

* ME29
The smaller machines in the 290x family were replaced in 1980 by the ME29 system.

=== Operating systems and software ===

====Executive====
The 290x operating system, known as &#x27;Executive&#x27;, allowed the machines to be operated &#x27;manually&#x27; via a video console. GEORGE1* ran on top of Executive to control batch processes by means of JCL (Job Control Language), which was based very closely upon the macro language of the 1900 GEORGE1S operating system.

====TME (Transaction Machine Environment)====
TME was the operating system on the ME29 and required CL (Control Language) to run jobs – &#x27;manual&#x27; operation being discouraged.

Practically all the software packages available on the 1900 range ran on the 290x and ME29 systems.

In about 1982, a new Transaction Processing System TME-TP was introduced for the ME29, with a subset of the facilities of TPMS (cf 2900 software).

TME came bundled with a hierarchical database management system called RAPID (Record Access Program Independent of Data). This was built around 1900 IDMS, and consisted of a set of user interfaces which provided a &quot;user friendly&quot; graphical database schema design and configuration environment, and an RML COBOL-based programming environment. Everything was compiled into the equivalent 1900 IDMS objects for use at run time.

== Personal computers ==

Amidst the broader appearance of personal computers in the early 1980s, ICL introduced the DRS 20 – a multi-user system equipped with multiple 8085 processors and supporting multiple clients – complemented by the DRS 20 Model 10 (or DRS 10) as a client machine, accessing the DRS 20 system&#x27;s resources over an ICL network. In this context, ICL&#x27;s commitment to the emerging microcomputer market was questioned by industry commentators who regarded the DRS 10 as a missed opportunity, producing a machine whose £ price was elevated substantially by a £ network card that could have been replaced with a disk controller to deliver a competitive standalone, but network-ready, CP/M system. ICL later added support for running CP/M under the DRX operating system, permitting CP/M applications to be used on DRS 10 machines.

ICL launched its Personal Computer range in 1982, licensing technology from Rair and effectively adopting the established Rair Black Box product as its own, an approach described as &quot;a prime example of badge engineering&quot; in one assessment of the range. In common with the DRS 20 models, the Rair design also used the 8085 processor, and the Personal Computer range consisted of the low-level Model 10 with 64 KB of RAM, dual floppy drives and two serial ports; the Model 30 as an upgraded Model 10, replacing one floppy drive with a hard drive; the Model 31 as an upgraded Model 30 with 128 KB of RAM and four serial ports; and the Model 32, upgrading the Model 31 to 256 KB of RAM and eight serial ports. The Model 31 and 32 were categorised as multi-user systems. CP/M and MP/M were offered as operating systems.

In 1983, ICL followed up with more designs licensed from Rair, also using the 8085, and running CP/M and MP/M. The Models 15, 25, 26 and 35 broadly superseded the earlier models, utilising a faster 8085A processor that could be upgraded to the 8088 processor. They supported RAM expansion up to 512 KB, increased the base provision of serial ports to four and permitted eight on any model, increased the floppy and hard drive storage capacity, and introduced disk caching and RAM disk functionality. A Model 36 followed in 1984 at the top of the range, fitted with an 8088 processor as standard and supporting Concurrent CP/M. 1985 saw another Rair-derived product, the ICL Quattro, a multi-user system employing a single 8086 processor and 8087 floating-point coprocessor, running Concurrent CP/M, and supporting multiple serial terminals.

ICL licensed other external designs, adopting the basic design of the Sinclair QL for its One Per Desk (1984), whose interoperability with contemporary systems rested largely on the bundled Psion Xchange software. ICL also supplied British Telecom with various models in its Merlin range of electronic office products, starting in 1983 with the M2226 small business computer, M1100 terminal, and M3300 communicating word processor, all offering connectivity features. The M2200 series was augmented with the low-end M2215 in 1984. In 1985, the One Per Desk joined these models in the BT Merlin portfolio as the Merlin Tonto.

== Departmental systems ==

For many years ICL marketed departmental computers under the DRS brand, standing originally for Distributed Resource System. During the mid-1980s, separate Office Systems business units had produced a disparate range of products including IBM-compatible PCs such as the PWS (an AT clone), small servers branded DRS, and a range of larger Unix servers sold under the Clan name. A re-branding in late 1988 pulled these together under the DRS brand, with a consistent grey and green livery.

In the mid-1980s ICL developed the DRS 300 in Kidsgrove, and ran down Utica.

In 1994 the DRS range was superseded by the SuperServer and TeamServer ranges of SPARC and Intel-based machines, running Unix or Microsoft operating systems.

== OEM products ==
In the early 1970s, ICL signed an OEM agreement with the Canadian company, Consolidated Computers Ltd (later Consolidated Computer Inc.) to distribute CCL&#x27;s key-to-disk data entry product, Key-Edit, in the British Commonwealth of countries as well as in western and eastern Europe. Models included Key Edit 100, 50, 59, 1000, and 2000. In the mid-1980s a version of the Key Edit 59 operating system was ported (in emulation mode) to the DRS 20 series and marketed as Data Entry 20.

== Subsidiaries ==

=== Dataskil ===
Dataskil Ltd or ICL Dataskil was a software house, formed from an internal department known as the User Programming Service (UPS), that developed commercial programs and some utility software for the ICL marketplace. Dataskil also provided consultants and project teams to work on ICL&#x27;s or direct clients&#x27; 1900 and 2900 projects. There were several divisions within Dataskil, including Consultancy Services, Transition Services, Project Management Services (PMS), etc.

Dataskil software products included:

====1900 Filan====
The ICL 1900 Filan manual (1st edition January 1973) describes Filan as:
&quot;a totally integrated system for the analysis of large quantities of complex data such as that collected in censuses and other surveys&quot;.

It was used to process the 1971 Indonesian Population Census. In the UK, Filan was used during the 1970s by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys to process the General Household Survey data. As there was only a small user community, ICL decided not to convert the software to run on its 2900 range of computers in the 1980s.

=== With Barclays Bank: BARIC Computing Services Ltd ===
This was a joint venture of International Computer Services Ltd (ICSL), a division of ICL, and Barclays, that provided computer services. In the early days of computing many organizations avoided the capital costs of purchasing their own equipment and the recruitment of technical specialists by putting their work out to service companies, such as BARIC, which were known as computer bureaux. BARIC also ran special groups such as the Advanced Videotex team, which investigated how new technologies such as Prestel could be leveraged.

This company operated two ICL 1900 mainframes (1904E and 1905S, in manual and GEORGE II operating system modes) from its head office in Newman Street, London. This site housed management, sales and support staff and a large programming team (site closed late 1975). Sales and support offices were in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cork, Dublin, Glasgow, Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Forest Gate, Hartree House Queensway, St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, Putney (ICL headquarters) and Manchester. The Queensway site was above Whiteleys department store, and had been used in the 1950s and 1960s by the LEO arm of food company J. Lyons to run data processing and an early bureau service.

Chris Gent was the managing director from 1979 to 1985, when he left to lead Vodafone. In 1985 most of BARIC&#x27;s bureau business was acquired by CMG (Computer Management Group).

=== India: ICIM ===
ICL had established a presence in India in its earliest days, through International Computers Indian Manufacture Ltd (ICIM), a partly owned subsidiary. As the name implies, ICIM took on some of the manufacturing of ICL-designed equipment, generally for overseas markets. In later years ICIM, from its offices in Pune, started to establish a presence in the market for offshore software development and eventually outsourcing of the operation of computer services. ICIM subsequently became a joint operation with Fujitsu, establishing links to Japan that were as strong as its traditional links to the UK. Reflecting the shift in its business, the company was renamed ICIL (International Computers India Limited), and again in 2000 to Zensar Technologies, a publicly traded company which has RPG Group as its largest shareholder.

=== Defence: DESC ===
DESC Ltd (subsequently ICL DESC Ltd.) was a subsidiary focused on defence systems spun out from ICL at the time of the Fujitsu takeover, to avoid concerns over defence systems ownership by the Japanese firm, as it was involved with battlefield systems which might be unconstitutional in Japan. These qualms were overcome and eventually it was merged back into the parent company.

=== Banking: iBANK Systems ===
iBANK Systems was a joint venture with Xcelsoft, Inc. of Canada to develop a Unix-based integrated retail banking system capable of distributed operation. Supported platforms included the DRS-6000 and DRS-3000, and the product was written in COBOL with some &#x27;glue&#x27; written in C. The international team was based in Greenville SC, US.

The venture lasted from 1992 through 1995 when the two companies dissolved the relationship and each went forward independently, thereby forking the project. The ICL branch was renamed Fujitsu-ICL International Banking Products, and continued operations until 2000 when ICL withdrew completely from operations in North America. Customers of iBANK Systems included Moscow Savings Bank (Russia), Suprimex (Russia), Chelindbank (Russia, project cancelled at the try-test phase), Mineral Bank (Bulgaria), Romanian Bank for Development (Romania), PTC (Zimbabwe), People&#x27;s Own Savings Bank (Zimbabwe), Mutual Bank of the Caribbean (Barbados), National Commercial Bank (Jamaica), and Caisse Populaire (Canada).

=== ICL Pathway and the Horizon system ===

In May 1996, ICL Pathway Limited (later Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited) was awarded the private finance initiative contract to develop the Horizon IT system to modernize Post Office and Benefits Agency operations. The project encountered a number of delays and setbacks during development, causing the Benefits Agency to abandon it in 1999, which led to a £180 million write-off at ICL and £571 million at the Post Office. The project in large part led to reputational damage to the ICL brand, causing the renaming of the company to Fujitsu Services in April 2002, and later to just Fujitsu.

Horizon provided both a replacement for the Post Office&#x27;s paper-based in-branch accounting, and point-of-sale functions. In 2004, Fujitsu described Horizon as &quot;Europe&#x27;s largest non-military IT contract&quot;. Richard Christou, who was chief executive from 2000 to 2004, later stated he led the original commercial negotiations on the Pathway project, and over the following 25 years it had been ICL and Fujitsu UK&#x27;s &quot;most profitable&quot; project.

Data from Horizon was later used to prosecute more than 900 sub-postmasters over unexplained losses, but it was found by the High Court in 2019 that &quot;bugs, errors and defects&quot; within the system could have caused the shortfalls. As of 2023, offers of compensation totalled more than £120 million and a public enquiry into the matter is ongoing.

== Corporate history ==
This section describes the various takeovers of and by ICL that followed its formation in 1969.

=== Singer Business Machines ===
Early in 1976, ICL acquired the international (that is, non-US) part of Singer Business Machines. The Singer group, a holding company which had diversified by adding many divisions, the most well-known of which was its early roots in sewing machines, and others such as the Business Machine division which was acquired by purchasing Friden, a San Leandro computer company, whose flagship product was the System Ten, a small business minicomputer. SBM had also acquired Cogar Corporation, a manufacturer of desktop intelligent terminals in Utica, New York, which after the ICL acquisition became the development and manufacturing plant for both minicomputers and terminals. The acquisition shifted the geographical balance of ICL&#x27;s sales away from the UK, and also gave a presence in industry markets such as retail and manufacturing. ICL subsequently developed the System Ten into the System 25, and used the product to spearhead the growth of its Retail Systems business during the 1980s.

=== 1981 crisis ===
ICL was in financial difficulty in 1981, with weak export performance against American and Japanese competition, and a takeover by an American manufacturer seemed likely. Christophor Laidlaw, deputy chairman of BP, was appointed as chairman and achieved a financial reconstruction, supported by loan guarantees from the government; he also oversaw the start of a technology agreement with Japan&#x27;s Fujitsu. In 1984, Laidlaw was succeeded by Sir Michael Edwardes, previously chairman of motor manufacturer British Leyland.

=== STC ===
On 26 July 1984 a £400 million takeover bid for ICL arrived from Sir Kenneth Corfield, head of Standard Telephones and Cables. The stated rationale was the predicted convergence of computers and telecommunications. The ICL board recommended acceptance of the bid, and the takeover was completed on 10 September. Sir Michael Edwardes, who had been chairman for just six months, resigned, and Laidlaw returned briefly as chairman. Robb Wilmot, who had arrived as managing director in 1981 (at the age of 36) remained, along with Peter Bonfield as marketing director.

The takeover caused losses at STC, leading in 1985 to a rights issue and Corfield&#x27;s replacement by Lord Keith as STC chairman, with Arthur Walsh as chief executive. Wilmot resigned, and Bonfield was appointed chairman and managing director of ICL. Within a few years ICL was contributing 60% of the profits and turnover of the combined group. Bonfield was appointed CBE for his role in turning the company around.

=== Datachecker ===
In 1988 STC acquired US retail systems specialist Datachecker Systems from National Semiconductor Corporation. At the time this was the second largest supplier in the US retail market, and greatly expanded ICL&#x27;s US presence.

=== Regnecentralen ===
In 1989, ICL acquired Regnecentralen of Denmark, a company with a distinguished history and reputation in that country, but which was best known internationally for its front-end communications handling equipment.

=== Computer Consoles Inc ===
Also in 1989 STC acquired CCI, suppliers of ICL&#x27;s Clan 5, 6 and 7 ranges (later DRS 500) and originator of OfficePower. By 1990 CCI&#x27;s Computer Products Division in Irvine, California, and Office Products Centre in Reston, Virginia, had been transferred to ICL.

=== Nokia Data ===
In 1991 ICL acquired Nokia Data, part of Nokia. Nokia Data was itself the result of Nokia&#x27;s mid-1980s acquisition of Ericsson Information Systems, whose origins lay in the purchase by Ericsson of the computer business of Saab, known as Datasaab. Financed with £ in cash, £ in preferred stock, and the assumption of £ of Nokia Data&#x27;s debt, ICL&#x27;s acquisition added 7,000 employees to the company (bringing the group&#x27;s total workforce to 21,000) and, with £ in revenue, effectively gave ICL a turnover of £. The acquisition brought with it a PC manufacturing capability, a suite of desktop software products, and more importantly a strong presence in the Nordic market and an awareness of the high-volume end of the IT market.

=== ICL KME-CS ===
In July, 1991 ICL acquired more than half of the Russian company KME-CS (Kazan Manufacturing Enterprise of Computer Systems, Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia). The agreement was signed between Peter Bonfield (President of ICL) and Mintimer Shaimiev (President of the Tatarstan Republic).

=== Fujitsu relationship and eventual acquisition ===
ICL&#x27;s relationship with Fujitsu started in 1981, when ICL needed a cheaper source of technology to develop lower-end machines in the 2900 range to compete with the IBM 4300 series. At this stage ICL was developing its own large scale integration (LSI) technology for use in the higher-end machines, designed as a successor to the highly successful 2966 processor (known internally as S3). ICL had visited a number of companies during 1980, including Fujitsu and Hitachi, to identify potential suppliers.

As part of the 1981 restructuring, Robb Wilmot – an electronics engineer and former head of Texas Instruments&#x27; British-based calculator operation – arrived as CEO in May 1981. He cancelled in-house LSI technology development, and negotiated an agreement that gave access to Fujitsu&#x27;s LSI and packaging technologies, which, when combined with ICL&#x27;s in-house CAD capability, enabled ICL to design and manufacture the DM1 and Estriel machines, later marketed profitably as Series 39 level 30 and 80.

Initially the collaboration with Fujitsu was presented as being an arm&#x27;s length one, to avoid diluting ICL&#x27;s credentials as a European and British company. However, Fujitsu&#x27;s involvement with ICL at both the financial and the technical level steadily increased over the subsequent two decades, and in 1990 Fujitsu acquired 80% of ICL plc from its parent STC plc, paying US$1.29 billion. In 1998 Fujitsu became ICL&#x27;s sole shareholder and the ICL brand was dropped in 2002.

Long term chief executive Keith Todd, in place for 13 years, planned to float ICL on the stock exchange, but due to on and off financial difficulties from some units of the company and the realisation that the parts of ICL sold separately were worth a lot more on the market than ICL as a whole, this was abandoned in 2000. Todd resigned and was replaced by Richard Christou, who dismantled the complicated matrix management structure, rationalised the balance sheet and sold some smaller units. One of ICL&#x27;s past acquisitions, CFM (Computer Facilities Management), was a key profitable outsourcing unit which originated from local government and managed both ICL and other manufacturer large customer installations. Christou expanded this unit moving the company further into services and away from being a computer supplier. Christou later said &quot;big outsourcing contracts, despite all their problems, actually were, and still are, the profit drivers in ICL&quot;.

=== Fujitsu Siemens ===
Following the acquisition of Nokia Data in 1991, personal computers and servers were marketed under the ICL brand. This changed when Fujitsu Siemens Computers was formed in 1999 as a joint venture between Fujitsu and Siemens. The joint venture absorbed all ICL&#x27;s hardware business with the exception of VME mainframes, and all the business of Siemens Nixdorf with the exception of its banking and retail systems. Fujitsu Siemens was merged back into Fujitsu in 2009.

=== PC Interworks Ltd ===
PC Interworks was incorporated in October 1995. It was created as a sales company, selling personal computer and other IT equipment to the employees of large organisations. The company, which evolved from a concept developed within ICL, began business with a contract from ICL to provide computer related products to its staff, as a part of its Employee Benefit Programme. PC Interworks was subsequently absorbed by International Computer Logistics Limited.

=== Transfer of ICL trademark to International Computer Logistics ===
International Computer Logistics, a British company specialising in IT repair and data recovery, secured the intellectual property rights to the ICL brand in 2014. It is based in Kidsgrove, North Staffordshire and was formed in 2012.

== ICL Fellowship ==

ICL Engineers responsible for pioneering achievements in the field of Computing could be recognised through the ICL Fellowship, established in 1990 by then-CEO Sir Peter Bonfield. The Fellows represented the peak of technological expertise within ICL and directly advised the company leadership on technology matters.

<doc id="515790" wikidata="Q10268314" url="?curid=515790" title="The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?">
<text>The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? is a full-length play written in 2000 by Edward Albee which opened on Broadway in 2002. It won the 2002 Tony Award for Best Play, the 2002 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, and was a finalist for the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

==Overview==
The tale of a married, middle-aged architect, Martin, his wife Stevie, and their son Billy, whose lives crumble when Martin falls in love with a goat, the play focuses on the limits of an ostensibly liberal society. Through showing this family in crisis, Albee challenges audience members to question their own moral judgment of social taboos.

The play also features many language games and grammatical arguments in the middle of catastrophes and existential disputes between the characters. The name of the play refers to the song &quot;Who Is Silvia?&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. Proteus sings this song, hoping to woo Silvia. It is also referred to in &quot;Finding the Sun&quot; (1982), an earlier work of Albee.

==Characters==
* Stevie Gray: the wife of Martin who, until Sylvia, had been his one and only love
* Martin Gray: a 50-year-old award-winning architect who falls in love with a goat
* Billy Gray: Stevie and Martin&#x27;s gay, emotionally sensitive, 17-year-old son
* Ross Tuttle: a family friend and host of a television program

==Plot==
=== Scene 1 ===
It is Martin&#x27;s 50th birthday. In his suburban living room, he and his wife Stevie prepare to be interviewed on television by their friend Ross. Martin seems distracted and cannot remember anything. Stevie casually asks Martin about a woman&#x27;s business card in his pocket and his odd scent. Martin denies having an affair with a woman, but confesses to falling in love with a goat named Sylvia. Stevie laughs it off, thinking it is a joke. Stevie leaves when Ross arrives. Ross begins interviewing Martin, congratulating him for being the youngest man ever to win the Pritzker Prize and recently being chosen to design a multi-billion-dollar city. However, Ross soon becomes frustrated with Martin’s inability to concentrate on the interview. Martin confides that the reason for his absent-mindedness is his affair with Sylvia, which began during his search for a country home. Amazed that Martin could fall in love with anyone but Stevie, Ross asks repeatedly, &quot;Who is Sylvia?&quot; Martin reveals a photo of Sylvia and Ross screams that Sylvia is a goat.

=== Scene 2 ===
Ross has written Stevie a letter regarding Martin&#x27;s affair and Sylvia&#x27;s identity. Stevie confronts Martin about this, with their son Billy also in the room. Billy is shocked and flees (throughout this scene, he enters and exits sporadically). Stevie recounts the normalcy of her life before she opened Ross&#x27;s letter. She realizes that Martin was telling the truth in Scene 1 and that she was right to worry about the business card and the odd scent. The card belongs to a member of a support group for bestiality. Martin claims that people like him seek animal company as a coping mechanism. For him, Sylvia is not just an animal; she has a soul and reciprocates his love. As Martin tries to justify himself, Stevie breaks various objects and overturns furniture. Finally, she exits, vowing revenge.

=== Scene 3 ===
Billy enters the ruined living room where Martin remains. Billy claims that Martin and Stevie are good people and are better than most of his classmates&#x27; parents. However, he begins crying once he realizes that Martin&#x27;s bestiality has torn their once happy family apart beyond repair. 

Overwhelmed with a sense of loss and love for his father, Billy embraces Martin and kisses him sexually on the mouth. Martin pushes Billy away just as Ross enters to witness the scene. Martin angrily defends both his son and himself. Ross says he received a call from Stevie saying Martin needed him. Ross and Martin spar over Ross&#x27;s letter and how Martin&#x27;s public image can be saved from disgrace. 

Stevie then enters, dragging a dead goat. With directions from Ross to the farm where Sylvia was kept, she found and killed the goat, because she could not stand the idea that she and Sylvia loved Martin equally, and were loved as equally by him. The scene and play ends with a tableau as Ross freezes, Stevie remains emotionless, Martin breaks down in tears, and Billy quietly tries to address his parents.

==Tragedy==
Albee places parentheses around the play&#x27;s subtitle: &quot;Notes toward a definition of tragedy&quot;. The original Greek meaning of the word tragedy is &quot;goat-song&quot;. The play maintains Aristotle&#x27;s six elements of a tragedy in addition to the three unities. The play&#x27;s resemblance to a Greek tragedy continues as Greek theater is linked to Dionysus. As the god of ritual madness, he inspires ecstasy that frees his followers from fears and subverts hegemony. Bestiality is considered taboo in contemporary society. Martin&#x27;s relationship with Sylvia thus defies convention. Unlike the other members in the support group, Martin does not understand why bestiality is wrong when he practices it devoid of previous trauma.

On the other hand, Stevie resembles a maenad with her increasingly frenzied actions. The play also alludes to the Eumenides. Before the interview starts, Ross hears &quot;a kind of...rushing sound...wings, or something,&quot; to which Martin replies, &quot;It&#x27;s probably the Eumenides.&quot; The noise disappears and Martin corrects himself because &quot;the Eumenides don&#x27;t stop.&quot; The allusion foreshadows Stevie&#x27;s vow for vengeance, carried out to conclude the play.

&quot;The Goat&quot; is also a problem play. Albee questions, among other concepts, social morality in relation to taboos, the perception of female identity by contrasting Stevie to Sylvia, and the arbitrary nature of social standards and conventions by juxtaposing Martin&#x27;s distaste for homosexuality with his bestiality.

<text>Xenozoic Tales is an alternative comic book by American artist Mark Schultz, set in a post-apocalyptic future. Originally published by Kitchen Sink Press, the series began in 1986 with the story &quot;Xenozoic!&quot; which was included in the horror comics anthology &quot;Death Rattle&quot; #8. This was shortly followed by &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; #1 in February 1987. Kitchen Sink published 14 issues between 1987 and 1996 and it has since been reprinted by several publishers, including Marvel Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Flesk Publications.

The series was well-received and in the early 1990s it won four Harvey Awards and three Eisner Awards. Despite this, issues started to be released further apart, eventually ceasing mid-story arc in issue #14.

&quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; also proved moderately successful under the title Cadillacs and Dinosaurs and spawned an animated series on CBS, an arcade game from Capcom, a Sega CD video game from Rocket Science Games, action figures, candy bars, and a &quot;Twilight 2000&quot; system role-playing game. The comic book reprints from Kitchen Sink and Marvel, and the continuation from Topps Comics, also used the &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot; name. The title &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot; and the likenesses of classic Cadillac automobiles were used with the consent of General Motors, which holds the phrase &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot; as a trademark and has licensed it for the comic books, the video game and the animated series.

Schultz&#x27;s illustrated novella, &quot;Storms at Sea&quot;, published in 2015 with Flesk Publications, includes details which appear to provide a back-history of the circumstances that led to the creating of the world as shown in &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot;.

== Publication history ==
=== &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; (Kitchen Sink Press): 1987–1996 ===
The original publication of &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; ran irregularly from 1987 until 1996, often with multiple years taking place between issues. The final issue, #14, ends in the middle of a story arc. While there is no time-frame, in 2012 Flesk Publications revealed they had tentative plans with Mark Schultz to create an additional 80 pages of story to complete the current story arc. The most recent mention of this is in the last pages of the Flesk collection &quot;Xenozoic&quot; where it states: &quot;The adventures of Hannah Dundee &amp; Jack Tenrec will continue. Look for more mystery, mayhem, &amp; intrigue in future &quot;Xenozoic&quot; stories!&quot;

=== &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot; (Marvel Comics): 1990–1991 ===
In 1990, under the banner of Epic Comics, Marvel Comics began reprinting &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; in full color under the title &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot;. These editions had completely new covers, but only the first six issues were reprinted and the series ceased publication in April 1991. As of yet, these colorized versions have never been released in a collected form.

=== &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot; (Topps Comics): 1994 ===

In 1994, Topps Comics began running their own continuation of &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot;, also under the title &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot;. The series only ran for one year, in which they released nine issues. The stories were designed to complement the original series, taking place between in the midpoint of the story &quot;Lords of the Earth&quot; in &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; #10, right after Wilhelmina Scharnhorst is elected governor, but before Jack has been driven into exile. In the original story, that moment lasts for only a few minutes, but Topps Comics sought the permission of Mark Schultz to turn it into a &quot;moment that stretches&quot;. While Mark Schultz did not write or draw any of the comics released by Topps, he was consulted on some of the story arcs to make sure they were kept as true to his vision as possible.

The series ran three main story arcs over the course of nine issues before &quot;going on hiatus&quot; right before the release of &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; issue #13. A fourth storyline titled &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot; was in the works, being drawn by David Roach, but was never released.

==Story==
In the storyline, Earth has been ravaged by pollution and natural disasters of all sorts in the 1990s. To escape this, humanity built vast underground cities in which they lived for approximately 500 years. Upon emerging, the humans found that the world had been reclaimed by previously extinct lifeforms (most spectacularly, dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals). In the new &#x27;Xenozoic&#x27; era, technology is extremely limited and those with mechanical skills command a great deal of respect and influence.

The two main characters of the series are mechanic Jack Tenrec and scientist/love interest, Hannah Dundee. Tenrec operates a garage in which he restores cars, particularly Cadillacs. Given that the post-apocalyptic world no longer possesses the ability to refine oil, Tenrec modifies his cars to run on dinosaur guano. These cars, of course, are frequently chased by rampaging dinosaurs in pulp style action-adventure stories.

Other characters include various criminals, politicians, scientists, and inventors who populate the dystopian world of tomorrow. There is also a race of reptilian humanoids called the Grith who cannot speak in a human language but instead communicate by spelling words with &quot;Scrabble&quot; tiles. These creatures have befriended Tenrec, and apparently have the ability to communicate telepathically with the dinosaurs. Added into the mix is Hermes, a half-tamed &quot;Allosaurus&quot; Jack raised, and who basically acts as the most threatening guard dog one could ask for.

==Characters==
* Jack Tenrec – an old blood mechanic who runs a garage. Old bloods are a group of people who repair machines that were left over from the great cataclysm that forced humanity to live underground. Despite his gruff and stubborn behavior, he is considered leader by the people in the City in the Sea (formerly Manhattan) more than their governors; he starts an on/off relationship with the beautiful Wasoon ambassador and scientist Hannah Dundee.
* Hannah Dundee – a beautiful scientist and ambassador from Wasoon (formerly Washington, D.C.). She came to the City in the Sea in order to build relations with her people, as not many trust them. Over the course of the comics, she becomes the love interest of Jack Tenrec despite their different views on things.
* Hermes – an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; who Jack raised after his mother was killed by poachers; although he can be vicious to others, he is gentle with Jack and Hannah. He first appeared when he saved his beloved master after he was being threatened by one of the Terhunes.
* Remfro Rhynchus – a reclusive yet obsessed oddball expert on zekes and their flying patterns, he soon builds an engineless plane that relies on thermal updrafts to keep afloat. He also befriends Hannah.
* Mustapha Cairo – an engineer and a mechanic who is a good friend to Jack. He becomes one of their allies in their fight for survival in the post-apocalyptic world overrun by dinosaurs and saber-toothed tigers. He is suave and level headed who does what he can do best in the tumultuous times in the city.
* Kirgo – an elderly, dry witted mechanic who is a friend to Jack. He seems to know why some people hate Jack and want him dead.
* Sheba – a wild card mechanic who sticks around the garage and has a close relationship with Kirgo. 
* Phu-tsering – a mechanic who is the kennel-master of Hermes who has a keen intellect and humble personality. 
* Ryder Corbett – an expert tracker who is a rival to Jack Tenrec. He is intelligent and crafty. Able to make a rifle powerful enough to kill a Shivat; also has a robotic prosthetic arm with two claws that looks like a Shivat hand. He is killed later by a mutated Shivat after a fight in the Garage against Tenrec. 
* The Terhune Clan – a family of poachers who are the enemies of Jack Tenrec; they have tried many times to kill him, but always fail.

** Hammer Terhune – an overweight poacher who despises Jack Tenrec. He is dumb as a stump but makes up for his ruthless leadership skills. He tries to kill Jack and Hannah many times, but always fails. He has two brothers named Wrench and Vice. He was later shot by Hannah after he took Jack hostage while escaping from an enraged woolly mammoth.
** Wrench Terhune – Hammer&#x27;s younger brother who is the middle child of the Terhune family. Previously, Wrench and some other poachers had murdered a Wasoon patrol. In the first issue, they plotted to kill the visiting Wasoon ambassador, in the belief that the Wasoons were coming after the murderers. When Jack intervened, Wrench tried to kill him, but Hermes came to Jack&#x27;s rescue and bit Wrench to death before flinging his corpse through a window.
** Vice Terhune – the youngest, most arrogant brother of the Terhune family. Like his two older brothers, he is a poacher and has a huge dislike of Jack Tenrec. He appears in two issues, the first when he finds an old case which he believes has gold in it, but later discovers that it has old American dollars instead. Later he turns to thieving, after the City in the Sea imposes a hunting license on all hunters.
** Mikla Von Ermine – Vice&#x27;s raving girlfriend who is obsessed with Vice, despite his domineering behavior and rival to Hannah.
** Black Elmer, Sherman Spurgeon and Brick Flinders – Henchmen of Vice who also have a particular hatred towards Jack. 
* Wilhelmina Scharnhorst – the leader of the &quot;Moles&quot;, a group of people who search the ancient ruins in and under the City in the Sea. She is a large woman who is determined, disdainful, masculine, pragmatic, corrupt, and condescending. She despises the old blood mechanics, as she believes that they are nothing but nuisances who stand in the way of progress. She runs for Governor of the City, after the death of Gov. Julian Gorgostamos.
* Lord Drumheller – Leader of Wassoon, he is cunning yet ambitious in his endeavor to gain knowledge of the world. Even if it means doing morally grey acts to achieve them.

** Gov. Nock – The figurehead to the Governors who acts as a &quot;yes-man&quot; to Scharnhorst. 
** Gov. Toulouse – One of the Governors who is the most neutral and laid back in his ideals with rare hints of any ambition. 
** Gov. Lorraine Dahlgren – The most flamboyant and savvy of the Governors, who may have had a thing of Jack Tenrec. She aids Jack&#x27;s and Hannah&#x27;s escape from the city. 
** Gov. Julian Gorgostamos – The deceased member of the quartet of Governors. He is a overweight man who seemed to be a kind and well-spoken to Hannah, but is later to be revealed as a cunning and cruel man who planned on luring Hannah and Jack into a trap only for them to leave him at the trap for hours. He is later killed by the Grith and his remains are found by Jack and Hannah. He has a bespectacled son named Julian the Younger who becomes an assistant to Scharnhorst.

* Big Red – Amaiza, better known as Big Red is a antagonist turned ally to Jack who is the leader of a female led biker gang that raids and pillages anything in their path. She is tough, ruthless, and charming with a leather uniform and long red hair, hence her name. She and Jack have a small affair, but Jack ends it quickly. She helps Jack fight The Terhune Clan and their plans in taking over a Vault that is Big Red&#x27;s home.
* Dr. Phileas Fessenden – a crazed scientist who strives to discover the secrets of what caused Slithers to exist, instead he turned himself and his fellow researchers into monstrous brain creatures that have telepathic abilities in the Great Swamps. Their tentacles wrap around their skeletons like ivy to ride on top of their former bodies. Though Phileas rides on a Shivat skeleton. He is killed when Felicia put him out of his misery when he was blown up by TNT. 
* Felicia Fessenden – daughter of the mad scientist, Phileas and old friend to Jack. She is head-strong researcher but desperate in finding her father when he became a mutated brain creature. 
* The Grith – a mysterious race of intelligent lizard men who cannot communicate in a human language, but can communicate with Scrabble tiles. They are said to be descendants of an unknown species of dinosaur. They are allies with Jack for some unknown reason and, later, they ally with Hannah as well.
** Hobbs – Jack&#x27;s contact in the Grith. He appears when Hannah was taken by the Grith, and then informs them that a settlement is about to be destroyed by an earthquake. 
** Wild Child – a human teenager who was raised by the Grith who wears a loincloth and animal hide boots. He wandered away from his home when he was only three years old and was then attacked by a pack of cave hyenas, but was saved by the Grith, who then raised him as one of their own. Ten years later, Hannah discovered Wild Child and tried to take him back, but eventually knew that he belonged with the Grith. Hannah reluctantly told the boy&#x27;s mother that she had found nothing.

==Prehistoric animals==
In the &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; universe, the humans have developed their own names for prehistoric creatures. Below are the names used in the comics and the real-life creatures they refer to:

==Locations==
The setting of &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; is along the Eastern coast of North America during the mid-27th century, most of America&#x27;s cities having been destroyed during the Great Cataclysm, with a few surviving:
* The City in the Sea – the remains of Manhattan and the series&#x27; main setting. As its name implies, it consists of several buildings that survived when Manhattan was flooded during the Great Cataclysm. The Empire State Building was one of the surviving buildings.
** Jack&#x27;s Garage – a large garage that is both the home and workshop of Jack Tenrec.
* Wassoon – the home of Hannah Dundee, located in the south and the remains of Washington, D.C. Its people the Wassoon are a tribe of scholars, but they are treated with disdain by many other surviving humans for reasons unknown. They sent Hannah to the City in the Sea with the hopes of gaining access to their library.
* Calhoon Mines – a copper mine located a few days from the City in the Sea. It is where the copper for the City in the Sea is mined; it was once besieged by a man-eating Shivat until it was killed by Jack and Hannah.
* Fessenden&#x27;s Station - a scientific research station that is a several-days journey from the City in the Sea, deep within the treacherous jungles, and established by Dr. Phileas Fessenden, a scientist highly revered by the city. Jack and Hannah discover the grisly fate of Fessenden and all his staff there, and the place is torched and declared forbidden. The Grith later secretly inform Jack that the abandoned station is the &quot;key to everything&quot;.

== Animated television series ==
In 1993 Nelvana adapted &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; into an animated television show for CBS Kids. The show lasted for one season of thirteen episodes. While not a direct adaptation of the comic book series, many of the episodes featured stories taken directly from &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot;. The show has developed a cult following and is currently available to watch in the U.S. through Amazon Video.

== Collected editions ==
The original series has been collected multiple times, starting with Kitchen Sink Press in 1989, Dark Horse Comics in 2003, and eventually in a single volume by Flesk Publications in 2013. Flesk also released a limited edition hardcover of the book after raising funds through Kickstarter. An &quot;Artists Edition&quot; was released by IDW Publishing in August 2013 and contains oversized reprints of the original art from issues #9–14 of the series. While these collections all contain the complete original series written by Mark Schultz, only the Kitchen Sink Press releases contain the backup stories drawn by Steve Stiles, though in 2012 Flesk Publications made it clear they were hunting for the original art from his stories for a future release.

The Epic Comics colorized issues and the Topps Comics series have never been released in collected form.
== Awards ==
Mark Schultz has won five Harvey Awards for his work on &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot;. He won three times for Best Artist or Penciller (1990, 1992, 1993), once for Best Inker (1997), and once for Best Single Issue or Story (&quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; #11, 1992).

&quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; also received two Eisner Awards: one for Best Short Story (&quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; #12 &quot;Two Cities&quot; 1992) and one for Best Black and White Series (1991).

<text>Jerry Butler Jr. (December 8, 1939 – February 20, 2025) was an American soul singer-songwriter, producer, musician, and politician. He was the original lead singer of the R&amp;B vocal group the Impressions, who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. After leaving the group in 1960, Butler achieved over 55 &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop and R&amp;B Chart hits as a solo artist including &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, and &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot;. He was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2015.

Butler served as a Commissioner for Cook County, Illinois, from 1985 to 2018. As a member of the 17-member county government board, he chaired the Health and Hospitals Committee and served as Vice Chair of the Construction Committee.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Butler was born in Sunflower, Mississippi, United States, on December 8, 1939. When Butler was three years old, the family moved to Chicago, Illinois, and he grew up in the Cabrini–Green housing projects. The mid-1950s had a profound effect on Butler&#x27;s life. He performed in a church choir with Curtis Mayfield. As a teenager, Butler sang in a gospel quartet called Northern Jubilee Gospel Singers, along with Mayfield. Mayfield, a guitar player, became the lone instrumentalist for the six-member Roosters group, which later became The Impressions. Inspired by Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers, the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, and the Pilgrim Travelers, getting into the music industry seemed inevitable.

Butler&#x27;s younger brother, Billy Butler, also had a career in the music industry, including playing guitar with Jerry&#x27;s band, until his death in 2015.

===Early recordings===
Butler co-wrote the song &quot;For Your Precious Love&quot; (which is ranked No. 327 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time) and wanted to record a disc. Looking for recording studios, the Impressions (the original members of which were Butler, Curtis Mayfield, Sam Gooden, Fred Cash − who left early on, and later returned − and brothers Arthur and Richard Brooks), auditioned for Chess Records and Vee-Jay Records. The group eventually signed with Vee-Jay, where they released &quot;For Your Precious Love&quot; in 1958. It became The Impressions&#x27; first hit and gold record.

===Solo career===
Butler was first given the nickname &quot;Iceman&quot; by WDAS Philadelphia disc jockey, Georgie Woods, while performing in a Philadelphia theater. He released the single &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot; in 1960, and the song peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard pop chart. Butler co-wrote, with Otis Redding, the latter&#x27;s hit song &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Loving You Too Long&quot; in 1965. Butler&#x27;s solo career saw a string of hits, including the Top 10 successes &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Find Another Girl&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m A-Telling You&quot; (all co-written by fellow Impression Curtis Mayfield and featuring Mayfield as harmony vocal), the million selling &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot;, &quot;Moon River&quot;, &quot;Need To Belong&quot; (recorded with the Impressions after he went solo), &quot;Make It Easy on Yourself&quot;, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot; (with Betty Everett), &quot;Brand New Me&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Understanding Mellow&quot; (with Brenda Lee Eager), &quot;Hey, Western Union Man&quot;, and &quot;Never Give You Up&quot;.

His 1969 &quot;Moody Woman&quot; release became a Northern Soul favourite and featured at number 369 in the Northern Soul Top 500. Butler released two successful albums, &quot;The Ice Man Cometh&quot; (1968) and &quot;Ice on Ice&quot; (1969). He collaborated on many of his successful recordings with the Philadelphia-based songwriting team of Gamble and Huff. In 1972, he had a small role in the cult classic film &quot;The Thing with Two Heads&quot; as a prison guard. With Motown, in 1976 and 1977, Butler produced and co-produced (with Paul David Wilson) two albums: &quot;Suite for the Single Girl&quot; and &quot;It All Comes Out in My Song&quot;.

In 1975, the pop group Tony Orlando and Dawn covered Butler&#x27;s 1960 song &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;, with a new title, &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You (Like I Love You)&quot;, and it was more successful than Butler&#x27;s original (#7), peaking at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===1980s–2018===
Butler continued to perform while serving as a Cook County Board Commissioner from 1985, before retiring from public office in 2018. As Cook County Commissioner, Butler voted to uphold a historic 2008 Cook County sales tax increase, which remains the highest in the nation. As a result, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; encouraged people to vote against him in the 2010 elections. Butler, however, won reelection in March 2014 with over 80 percent of the vote.

He later served as host of PBS TV music specials such as &quot;Doo Wop 50&quot; and &quot;51&quot;, &quot;Rock Rhythm and Doo Wop&quot;, and &quot;Soul Spectacular: 40 years of R&amp;B&quot;, among others. He also served as chairman of the board of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. In 1991, Butler was inducted, along with the other original members of the Impressions (Curtis Mayfield, Sam Gooden, Fred Cash, and Arthur and Richard Brooks), into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Butler released &quot;Time &amp; Faith&quot; in 1992.

The Hives covered &quot;Find Another Girl&quot; on their 2000 album &quot;Veni Vidi Vicious&quot;. The Black Keys covered &quot;Never Give You Up&quot; on their 2010 album, &quot;Brothers&quot;.

===Personal life and death===
His wife Annette, originally one of his backup singers, died in 2019.

After his 1991 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Impressions, some music writers and critics stated that Butler also deserved a second induction as a solo artist, based upon his successful career as a recording artist and songwriter after leaving that group.

Butler died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease at his home in Chicago, on February 20, 2025, at the age of 85.

<doc id="515803" wikidata="Q2642828" url="?curid=515803" title="Alberto Fernández">
<text>Alberto Ángel Fernández (; born 2 April 1959) is an Argentine politician, lawyer, and academic who served as President of Argentina from 2019 to 2023. He was also the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers from 2003 to 2008. His tenure as Cabinet Chief remains the longest since the post was created in 1994.

Born in Buenos Aires, Fernández attended the University of Buenos Aires, where he earned his law degree at age 24, and later became a professor of criminal law. Ideologically a Peronist, entered public service as an adviser to Deliberative Council of Buenos Aires and the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. In 2003, he was appointed Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, serving during the entirety of the presidency of Néstor Kirchner, and the early months of the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.

A member of the Justicialist Party, a Peronist party, Fernández was the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2019 presidential election under the leftist Frente de Todos alliance and defeated incumbent president Mauricio Macri with 48% of the vote. His political position has been described as left-wing. The first two years of his presidency was limited by the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina, during which he imposed strict lockdown measures to suppress the spread of the disease, and a debt crisis inherited from his predecessor. While the economy recovered in 2021–22, inflation rose to 100% (the highest since 1991). His approval ratings have been constantly low throughout his presidency, only in few certain occasions over 50% approval rate, with disapproval ratings from 60% to 80%.

According to British newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot;, Fernández was considered &quot;a president without a plan&quot;, and his presidency to be a &quot;weak administration&quot;, alluding to his lack of independent decision-making. Instead, his decisions were under heavy influence of Vice President and former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, also leader of the coalition, whom Fernández himself described as a &quot;permanent source of consultation&quot;. In April 2023, Fernández announced that he decided to not seek reelection to the presidency in the 2023 presidential election. He was succeeded by Javier Milei on 10 December 2023. Leaving office with a disapproval rate of around 80%, Fernández is seen as one of the worst presidents in Argentine history.

==Early life and career==
Fernández was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Celia Pérez and her first husband. Separated from the latter, Celia (sister of the personal photographer of Juan Domingo Perón) married Judge Carlos Pelagio Galíndez (son of a Senator of the Radical Civic Union). Alberto Fernández, who barely knew his biological father, considers Pelagio to be his father.

Fernández attended the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Law. He graduated at the age of 24, and later became a professor of criminal law. He entered public service as an adviser to Deliberative Council of Buenos Aires and the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. He became deputy director of Legal Affairs of the Economy Ministry, and in this capacity served as chief Argentine negotiator at the GATT Uruguay Round. Nominated by newly elected President Carlos Menem to serve as Superintendent of Insurance, Fernández served as President of the Latin American Insurance Managers&#x27; Association from 1989 to 1992, and co-founded the Insurance Managers International Association. He also served as adviser to Mercosur and ALADI on insurance law, and was involved in insurance and health services companies in the private sector. Fernández was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young People of Argentina in 1992, and was awarded the Millennium Award as one of the nation&#x27;s Businessmen of the Century. During this time he became politically close to former Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde.
He was elected on 7 June 2000, to the Buenos Aires City Legislature on the conservative Action for the Republic ticket led by former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo.

==Chief of the Cabinet (2003–2008)==

He gave up his seat when he was appointed Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers by President Néstor Kirchner upon taking office on 25 May 2003, and retained the same post under Kirchner&#x27;s wife and successor, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, upon her election in 2007.

A new system of variable taxes on agricultural exports led to the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector, during which Fernández acted as the government&#x27;s chief negotiator. The negotiations failed, however, and following Vice President Julio Cobos&#x27; surprise, tie-breaking vote against the bill in the Senate, Fernández resigned on 23 July 2008.

==Pre-presidency==
He was named head of the City of Buenos Aires chapter of the Justicialist Party, but minimized his involvement in Front for Victory campaigns for Congress in 2009. Fernández actively considered seeking the Justicialist Party presidential nomination ahead of the 2011 general elections. He ultimately endorsed President Cristina Kirchner for re-election, however.
He was campaign manager of the presidential candidacy of Sergio Massa in 2015.

==Presidential elections==
===Presidential campaign===

On 18 May 2019, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner announced that Fernández would be a candidate for president, and that she would run for vice president alongside him, hosting his first campaign rally with Santa Cruz Governor Alicia Kirchner, sister-in-law of the former Kirchner.

About a month later, seeking to broaden his appeal to moderates, Fernández struck a deal with Sergio Massa to form an alliance called Frente de Todos, wherein Massa would be offered a role within a potential Fernández administration, or be given a key role within the Chamber of Deputies in exchange for dropping out of the presidential race and offering his support. Fernández also earned the endorsement of the General Confederation of Labor, receiving their support in exchange for promising that he will boost the economy, and that there will be no labor reform.

===General elections===
On 11 August 2019, Fernández won first place in the 2019 primary elections, earning 47.7% of the vote, compared to incumbent President Mauricio Macri&#x27;s 31.8%. Fernández thereafter held a press conference where he said he called Macri to say that he would help Macri complete his term and &quot;bring calm to society and markets&quot;, and that his economic proposals do not run the risk of defaulting on the national debt.
In the 27 October general election, Fernández won the presidency by attaining 48.1% of the vote to Macri&#x27;s 40.4%, exceeding the threshold required to win without the need for a ballotage. In Argentina, a presidential candidate can win outright by either garnering at least 45 percent of the vote, or winning 40 percent of the vote while being 10 points ahead of his or her nearest challenger. He owed his victory mainly to carrying Buenos Aires Province by over 1.6 million votes, accounting for almost all of his nationwide margin of 2.1 million votes. By comparison, Daniel Scioli only carried the country&#x27;s largest province by 219,000 votes four years earlier.

==Presidency (2019–2023)==

===Inauguration===
Fernández was sworn in on 10 December 2019.

===Economic policy===

On 14 December, the government established by decree the emergency in occupational matters and double compensation for dismissal without just cause for six months.

His first legislative initiative, the Social Solidarity and Productive Recovery Bill, was passed by Congress on 23 December. The bill includes tax hikes on foreign currency purchases, agricultural exports, wealth, and car sales - as well as tax incentives for production. Amid the worst recession in nearly two decades, it provided a 180-day freeze on utility rates, bonuses for the nation&#x27;s retirees and Universal Allocation per Child beneficiaries, and food cards to two million of Argentina&#x27;s poorest families. It also gave the president additional powers to renegotiate debt terms – with Argentina seeking to restructure its US$100 billion debt with private bondholders and US$45 billion borrowed by Macri from the International Monetary Fund. As the capital controls stayed in effect and with no prospect of being removed, the country was degraded from emerging market to standalone market by MSCI.

Organizations of the agricultural sector, including Sociedad Rural Argentina, CONINAGRO, Argentine Agrarian Federation and Argentine Rural Confederations, rejected the increase in taxes on agricultural exports. Despite these conflicts, Fernández announced the three-point increase in withholding tax on soybeans on the day of the opening of the regular sessions, on 1 March and generated major problems in the relationship between the government and the agricultural sector.

Argentina defaulted again on 22 May 2020 by failing to pay $500 million on its due date to its creditors. Negotiations for the restructuring of $66 billion of its debt continue.

The International Monetary Fund reported that the COVID-19 crisis would plunge Argentina&#x27;s GDP by 9.9 percent, after the country&#x27;s economy contracted by 5.4 percent in first quarter of 2020, with unemployment rising over 10.4 percent in the first three months of the year, before the lockdown started.

On 4 August, Fernández reached an accord with the biggest creditors on terms for a restructuring of $65bn in foreign bonds, after a breakthrough in talks that had at times looked close to collapse since the country&#x27;s ninth debt default in May.

On 22 September, as part of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, official reports showed a 19% year-on-year drop in the GDP for the second quarter of 2020, the biggest drop in the country&#x27;s history. Investment went down 38% from the previous year. The poverty rate rose to 42% in the second half of 2020, the highest since 2004. Child poverty reached the 57.7% of minors of 14 years.

===Social policy===
On 31 December 2019, Fernández announced that he would send a bill in 2020 to discuss the legalization of abortion, ratified his support for its approval, and expressed his wish for &quot;sensible debate&quot;. However, in June 2020, he stated that he was &quot;attending to more urgent matters&quot; (referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the debt restructuring), and that &quot;he&#x27;ll send the bill at some point&quot;. In November 2020, Fernández&#x27;s legal secretary, Vilma Ibarra, confirmed that the government would be sending a new bill for the legalization of abortion to the National Congress that month. The Executive sent the bill, alongside another bill oriented towards women&#x27;s health care (the &quot;1000 Days Plan&quot;), on 17 November 2020. The bill was passed by the Senate, legalizing abortion in Argentina, on 30 December 2020.

On 1 March, he also announced a restructuring of the Federal Intelligence Agency (AFI), including the publications of its accounts - which had been made secret by Macri in a 2016 decree. The AFI had been criticized for targeting public figures for political purposes.

On 17 August, protests took place in many cities across Argentina against measures taken by Fernández, primarily the Justice Reform Bill his government had sent to the Congress, but also, among other causes: for the &quot;defense of institutions&quot; and &quot;separation of powers&quot;, against the government&#x27;s quarantine measures, the perceived lack of liberty and the increase in crime, and a raise on state pensions.

On 4 September 2020, Fernández signed a Necessity and Urgency Decree (Decreto 721/2020) establishing a 1% employment quota for trans and travesti people in the national public sector. The measure had been previously debated in the Chamber of Deputies as various prospective bills. The decree mandates that at any given point, at least 1% of all public sector workers in the national government must be transgender, as understood in the 2012 Gender Identity Law.

On 20 July 2021, Fernández signed another Necessity and Urgency Decree (Decreto 476/2021) mandating the National Registry of Persons (RENAPER) to allow a third gender option on all national identity cards and passports, marked as an &quot;X&quot;. The measure applies to non-citizen permanent residents who possess Argentine identity cards as well. In compliance with the 2012 Gender Identity Law, this made Argentina one of the few countries in the world to legally recognize non-binary gender on all official documentation.

On 12 November 2020 Fernández signed a decree legalizing the self-cultivation and regulating the sales and subsidized access of medical cannabis, expanding upon a 2017 bill that legalized the use and research of the plant and its derivatives. In June 2019, during his presidential campaign, he had signaled his intention to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes, but not other types of drugs.

===Foreign relations===


During his administration, Argentina&#x27;s relationship with Brazil became somewhat strained. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro refused to attend Fernández&#x27;s inauguration, accusing him of wanting to create a &quot;great Bolivarian homeland&quot; on the border and of preparing to provoke a flight of capital and companies into Brazil. Fernández and Bolsonaro had their first conversation through a video conference on 30 November 2020, during which both presidents agreed on the importance of cooperation and the role of Mercosur.

U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s top adviser for the Western Hemisphere, Mauricio Claver-Carone, crossed Fernández in 2019 saying: &quot;We want to know if Alberto Fernández will be a defender of democracy or an apologist for dictatorships and leaders in the region, whether it be Maduro, Correa or Morales.&quot;

Under Fernández, Argentina has retired in the Lima Group formed by North and South American nations to address the crisis in Venezuela, after not subscribing to any of the Group&#x27;s statements and resolutions. Argentina voted in favor of the United Nations resolution to back the continuity of the UN Human Rights Office report on human rights violations in Venezuela. Under Fernández, Argentina withdrew recognition of Juan Guaidó as interim President of Venezuela. In January 2020, the Fernández administration revoked Elisa Trotta Gamus credentials, who was Guaidó&#x27;s envoy to Argentina and whose representation had been approved by the Macri administration. However, Fernández also refused to recognize Maduro&#x27;s envoy Stella Lugo&#x27;s credentials and Foreign Minister Felipe Solá asked her to return to Caracas.

Alberto Fernández questioned the conclusions the Organization of American States that the reelection of Evo Morales was unconstitutional for electoral fraud. Fernández&#x27;s government recognized Morales as the legitimate President of Bolivia, and granted him asylum in Argentina in December 2019. On 9 November 2020, with Luis Arce&#x27;s victory in 2020, Fernández personally accompanied Morales to the Argentine border with Bolivia, wherein the two leaders held a public act celebrating Morales&#x27;s return to his home country.

In January 2020, Fernández traveled to Israel for his first presidential trip abroad. There he paid respects to the victims of the Holocaust and maintained a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who thanked him for keeping Hezbollah branded as a terrorist organization, a measure taken by former President Mauricio Macri.

Regarding Argentina&#x27;s strained relations with Iran, Fernández publicly defended the Memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran, although critical of this prior to taking office. In September 2020, Fernández asked Iran before the UN General Assembly to &quot;cooperate with the Argentine justice&quot; to bring justice to the cause and extradite those Iranian officials who stand accused of the attack. He further stated that if the officials were to be found innocent, &quot;they could freely return to Iran or otherwise face the consequences for their actions.&quot;

Alberto Fernández has developed close ties with China and visited Beijing during the 2022 Winter Olympics, where China expressed support for Argentina&#x27;s sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.

In January 2022, Fernández was elected president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), succeeding Mexico&#x27;s Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Fernández condemned the invasion and called on Russia to end military actions in Ukraine. At the UN, Argentina voted to condemn the Russian invasion and demanded a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. In July 2022, Fernández stated further support to Ukraine in a phone conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to whom he promised to deliver more humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Fernández rejected sanctions against Russia and did not want to send weapons to Ukraine.

In September 2023, Fernández condemned Azerbaijan for the blockade of the Lachin corridor and urged the international community to &quot;act preemptively&quot; to avoid &quot;new persecutions&quot; of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.

===Position during COVID-19 pandemic and measures===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fernandez&#x27;s government announced a country-wide lockdown, in effect from 20 March until 31 March, later extended until 12 April. The lockdown was further renewed on 27 April, 11 May, 25 May, 8 June, 1 July, 18 July, 3 August, 17 August, 31 August and 21 September, and included several measures including travel, transport and citizen movement restrictions, stay-at-home orders, store closures and reduced operating hours.

Responses to the outbreak have included restrictions on commerce and movement, closure of borders, and the closure of schools and educational institutions. The announcement of the lockdown was generally well received, although there were concerns with its economic impact in the already delicate state of Argentina&#x27;s economy, with analysts predicting at least 3% GDP decrease in 2020. Fernandez later announced a 700 billion pesos (US$11.1 billion) stimulus package, worth 2% of the country&#x27;s GDP. After announced a mandatory quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries, the government closed its borders, ports, and suspended flights.

On 23 March, Fernández asked the Chinese president Xi Jinping for 1,500 ventilators as Argentina had only 8,890 available.

Included in the package was the announcement of a one-time emergency payment of 10,000 pesos (US$152, as of 20 March) to lower-income individuals whose income was affected by the lockdown, including retirees. Because banks were excluded in the list of businesses that were considered essential in Fernandez&#x27;s lockdown decree, they remained closed until the Central Bank announced banks would open during a weekend starting on 3 April.

Due to Argentina&#x27;s notoriously low level of banking penetration, many Argentines, particularly retirees, do not possess bank accounts and are used to withdraw funds and pensions in cash. The decision to open banks for only three days on a reduced-hours basis sparked widespread outrage as hundreds of thousands of retirees (coronavirus&#x27; highest risk group) flocked to bank branches in order to withdraw their monthly pension and emergency payment.

Due to the national lockdown, the economic activity suffered a collapse of nearly 10% in March 2020 according to a consultant firm. The highest drop was of the construction sector (32%) versus March 2019. Every economic sector suffered a collapse, with finance, commerce, manufacturing industry and mining being the most affected. The agriculture sector was the least affected, but overall the economic activity for the first trimester of 2020 accumulates a 5% contraction. It is expected that the extension of the lockdown beyond April would increase the collapse of the Argentinian economy. In March, the primary fiscal deficit jumped to US$1,394 million, an 857% increase year-to-year. This was due to the public spending to combat the pandemic and the drop in tax collection due to low activity in a context of social isolation. Schools were closed for over a year, and it is estimated that 1.5 million of kids abandoned school, 13% of the total.

Despite the government&#x27;s hard lockdown policy, Fernández has been harshly criticized for not following the appropriate protocols himself. This included traveling throughout the country, taking pictures with large groups of supporters without properly wearing a mask nor respecting social distancing, and holding social gatherings with union leaders.

On 3 September, despite most local governments still enforcing strict lockdown measures, Fernández stated that &quot;there is no lockdown&quot;, and that such thoughts had &quot;been instilled by the opposition&quot;, as part of a political agenda. Fernández eased some lockdown measures in the Greater Buenos Aires on 6 November 2020, shifting to a &quot;social distancing&quot; phase.

On 21 January 2021, Fernández became the first Latin American leader to be inoculated against the disease via the recently approved Gam-COVID-Vac (better known as Sputnik V). On 7 December 2021, Fernández received his booster dose of the vaccine.

Ginés González García was forced to resign as Health Minister on 19 February 2021 after it was revealed he provided preferential treatment for the COVID-19 vaccine to his close friends, including journalist Horacio Verbitsky and other political figures. He was succeeded by the second in charge Carla Vizzotti. The revelation was met with wide national condemnation from supporters and opposition, as Argentina had at the time received only 1.5 million doses of vaccine for its population of 40 million.

Fernández tested positive for the COVID-19 on 2 April 2021 having a &quot;light fever&quot;.

===Justicialist Party chairmanship===
On 22 March 2021, Fernández was elected by the national congress of the Justicialist Party as the party&#x27;s new national chairman, succeeding José Luis Gioja. Fernández ran unopposed, heading the &quot;Unidad y Federalismo&quot; list, which received the support of diverse sectors in the Peronist movement, including La Cámpora.

===Midterm elections 2021===
Confirming the trend of that year&#x27;s primary elections, the Frente de Todos suffered major losses in the November 2021 legislative elections. The FDT lost its majority in the Senate (the first time in nearly 40 years that Peronists lost control of the upper house), and the opposition Juntos por el Cambio coalition gained the upper hand in traditional peronist strongholds, such as La Pampa and Santa Cruz. Observers attributed the loss to the widespread anger over high inflation and rising poverty. The reduced pluralities in both houses of Congress meaning the government will now have to engage in negotiations to pass any initiative requiring legislative approval.

==Controversies==

=== Allegations of racism ===
On 9 June 2021, Fernández was at a meeting with business leaders alongside Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez at the Casa Rosada. When he sought to play up the Argentinian ties with Europe, he said &quot;The Mexicans came from the Indians, the Brazilians came from the jungle, but we Argentines came from the ships. And they were ships that came from Europe.&quot; Fernández erroneously attributed the quote to the Mexican poet, essayist and diplomat Octavio Paz, although it had originated from lyrics by local musician and personal friend Litto Nebbia. Faced with the negative backlash to his comments, on the same day Fernández apologized on Twitter and the next day sent a letter to the director of the National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI), clarifying his comments.

=== Violations of COVID-19 rules ===
In August 2021, it was revealed that there had been numerous visits to the presidential palace during the lockdown that he had imposed in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; visitors included an actress, a dog trainer, and a hairdresser, as well as hosting a birthday party for the First Lady.

=== Rejection of a Supreme Court ruling ===
In December 2022, Fernandez sparked a battle with the Supreme Court of Argentina and a legal crisis after he said he would reject a ruling it made to give a larger proportion of state funds to the city of Buenos Aires. In a ruling the Supreme Court said the level of funds to Buenos Aires should be raised from 1.4% of the total pool of funds to 2.95% after it was cut by government decree during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. He said the ruling was unjustified and pledged to ignore it; &quot;it is an unprecedented, incongruous, and impossible-to-enforce ruling&quot;, calling the decision politically motivated ahead of general elections next year and adding that it would hurt the other provinces. His remarks sparked off a backlash, with critics saying the rejection of a Supreme Court decision set a dangerous precedent and undermined the justice system, while several provincial governors sided with Fernandez and criticized the court ruling. Buenos Aires city mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, criticized the declaration of Fernandez, saying; &quot;the president decided to break the constitutional order, completely violate the rule of law and attack democracy.&quot; Various industry groups criticized the move as dangerous to the rule of law.

=== Other controversies ===
Fernández has engaged in disputes with users on Twitter before his presidency, in which his reactions have been regarded as aggressive or violent by some. Tweets show him responding to other users with expletives such as &quot;pelotudo&quot; (Argentinian slang for &quot;asshole&quot;), &quot;pajero&quot; (&quot;wanker&quot;), and &quot;hijo de puta&quot; (&quot;son of a bitch&quot;); he also called presidential candidate José Luis Espert &quot;Pajert&quot;, a word play between his last name and the Argentine slang for &quot;wanker&quot;. In December 2017, he responded to a female user by saying, &quot;Girl, what you think doesn&#x27;t worry me. You better learn how to cook. Maybe then you can do something right. Thinking is not your strong suit&quot;.

In June 2020, he told journalist Cristina Pérez to &quot;go read the Constitution&quot;, after being questioned about his attempts to install a government-designated administration in the Vicentín agricultural conglomerate.

In a 2017 interview for the Netflix mini-series &quot;Nisman: The Prosecutor, the President, and the Spy&quot;, Fernández stated that &quot;To this day, I doubt that [Nisman] committed suicide&quot;; however, after he became president in 2020, Fernández reportedly said, &quot;I am convinced that it was a suicide, after doubting it a lot, I am not going to lie.&quot; He was referring to Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor investigating Fernández&#x27;s vice president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for her suspected cover-up of Iran&#x27;s participation in the 1994 AMIA bombing. Nisman accused Fernández de Kirchner of secretly negotiating with Iranian officials to cover up their complicity in the attack in exchange for oil to reduce Argentina&#x27;s energy deficit. Officially, the agreement called for the exchange of Argentinian grain for Iranian oil. Nisman was found dead in his apartment on 18 January 2015, only hours before he was scheduled to present his report to Congress.

==Post-presidency (2023–present)==

Alberto Fernández was invited by the National Electoral Council of Venezuela to be an observer of the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election. Before leaving he was interviewed by &quot;Radio con Vos&quot;. He said &quot;If Maduro is defeated, what he has to do is to accept it. As Lula said (n: the president of Brazil, Lula da Silva), who wins, wins, and who loses, loses. Period. The end. Democracy is like that. I&#x27;m not going to legalize anyone, but do as asked, be an observer in the elections so everything works out smoothly&quot;. The following day he was called by the presidency of Venezuela and told not to travel, as his words would suggest that he was not going to be an impartial observer.

Fernández stepped down as president of the Justicialist Party after several photos that allegedly showed the injuries that Fabiola Yáñez suffered after being physically abused by him were published by Infobae. He has also been accused of &quot;sexual violence&quot; as he forced Yáñez into having an abortion in 2016. On 14 August 2024, Fernández was indicted on charges of domestic abuse against Yáñez.

==Personal life==
Fernández married Marcela Luchetti, a fellow University of Buenos Aires law student, in 1993. They separated in 2005. Fernández and Luchetti have a single child, Tani Fernández Luchetti (born 1994) known in Argentina for being a drag performer and cosplayer who goes by the stage name Dyhzy.

From 2014 to 2024, Fernández was in a relationship with journalist and stage actress Fabiola Yáñez, who fulfilled the role of First Lady of Argentina during Fernández&#x27;s presidency.
 The couple owns three dogs: Dylan (named after Bob Dylan, whom Fernández has praised and cited as an inspiration) and two of Dylan&#x27;s puppies, Prócer and Kaila. On 23 September 2021, the presidential office&#x27;s medical unit announced Yáñez was expecting her first child. Yáñez and Fernández&#x27;s son, Francisco Fernández Yáñez, was born on 11 April 2022 at Sanatorio Otamendi, in Buenos Aires. On 6 August 2024, Yáñez accused Fernández of domestic abuse during their tenure as president and first lady respectively; Fernández denied the allegations. An Argentine court banned Fernández from leaving the country while the investigation is underway. On 14 August, the Argentine federal prosecutor&#x27;s office requested the indictment of Alberto Fernandez for &quot;assault and battery with aggravating circumstances&quot;.

Fernández is also an Honorary Professor of Tsinghua University.

Fernández is a supporter of Argentinos Juniors&#x27; football team.

<doc id="515806" wikidata="Q7761498" url="?curid=515806" title="The Roosters">
<text>are a Japanese rock band formed in Fukuoka Prefecture in 1979. Their music has mixed rock and roll, punk rock, British blues, ska, and new wave. Originally active from 1979 to 1988, they performed at the 2004 Fuji Rock Festival before restarting activities in 2009. Through the years, guitarist Hiroyuki Hanada remained the only constant member, with the band currently consisting of the original lineup. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the Roosters at number 75 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In September 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; rated their album &quot;Good Dreams&quot; number 28 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time&quot;.

==History==
They formed in 1979 in the Hakata ward of Fukuoka, named after the blues standard &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;. Although there were four different lineups throughout the life of the band—all centered around guitarist Hiroyuki Hanada--Shinya Oe was the band&#x27;s first frontman. Oe not only sang lead vocals, but also dominated the writing of lyrics and music for the group for the first three albums. In addition to Oe&#x27;s contributions, the first two albums were made up of several cover songs. Their third album &quot;Insane&quot; was a step in a new direction, it was not only the first original Roosters album, but it also featured the first Roosters song not written and composed by Oe: &quot;Baby Sitter&quot;, written and composed by bassist Tomio Inoue. This was the first sign of a more democratic Roosters, and it paved the way for Hanada to compose songs for their fourth album &quot;Dis.&quot;

The Roosters&#x27; sixth album &quot;φPHY&quot; was Oe&#x27;s last with the group, with only about half of the record credited to him. The rest of the album is credited to Toshiyuki Shibayama for his lyrics and Hanada for his musical compositions. Shibayama continued to write a large portion of the lyrics for the group until they broke up, but never played with them or was an official member. The Roosters appeared, along with other Japanese rock bands, in the 1982 Sogo Ishii film &quot;Burst City&quot;. In 1985 Shinya Oe decided to take an indefinite break from making music and left the band. Despite losing an integral member of the band the Roosters pressed on and released their seventh album &quot;Neon Boy&quot; less than nine months after Oe&#x27;s departure. A single, &quot;Out Land&quot;, was Jun Shimoyama&#x27;s first contribution as a songwriter and composer for the group. Shimoyama continued to write lyrics and music for the band along with Hanada until the band&#x27;s dissolution in 1988.

In March 1999 a tribute album entitled &quot;Respectable Roosters&quot; was released and featured bands influenced by The Roosters such as the pillows, Thee Michelle Gun Elephant, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, Supercar, Kemuri and others performing covers of their songs.

In the year 2002, four of the original Roosters from various incarnations came together to form the Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Gypsies.

In 2004 Shinya Oe ended his lengthy musical hiatus to reunite with the original lineup of the Roosters to perform at the 2004 Fuji Rock Festival.

<text>This is a list of characters from the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and its prequel film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark.&quot;

==Main characters==
===Cast table===
===Main character biographies===
====Tony Soprano====
====Jennifer Melfi====
====Carmela Soprano====
====Christopher Moltisanti====
====Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano====
====Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero====
Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero is portrayed by Vincent Pastore. Big Pussy was a longtime close friend and mob enforcer for Tony Soprano, and was also shown to be close friends with fellow DiMeo crime family mobsters Paulie &quot;Paulie Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri, Silvio Dante, and was once a close friend to Tony&#x27;s uncle Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano. In the tie-in video game it is revealed he has an illegitimate son named Joey LaRocca. Samson Moeakiola portrays a young Bonpensiero in the 2021 prequel film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;.

The son of Lino Bonpensiero, Salvatore Bonpensiero started out as a cat burglar, and was affectionately known as Pussy, in reference to those talents. He was called &quot;Big Pussy&quot; to distinguish him from Gennaro &quot;Little Pussy&quot; Malenga. Sal had a wife Angie and three children. He operated an auto body shop with his brother Edward &quot;Duke&quot; Bonpensiero. Sal was a soldier in the Soprano crew, and he backed &quot;Johnny Boy&quot; Soprano&#x27;s wishes to have Tony Soprano become capo following Johnny&#x27;s death in 1986.

In order to put his children through college, he dealt heroin on the side. Sometime between 1995 and 1998, Sal was caught by the FBI and decided to inform against the Soprano crew in order to avoid the possibility of life in prison. He was assigned Agent Skip Lipari as his handler. He was revealed as an informant in the episode &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot;. In flashbacks to 1995, it is shown that Sal was instrumental in organizing a sit-down between high-ranking capo Junior Soprano and acting boss Jackie Aprile Sr. He traveled to Boca Raton to persuade Junior to return to New Jersey and settle a trucking dispute with Aprile. However, Sal was suspiciously late for the sit-down and blamed the health problems of his comare&#x27;s mother.

In 1998, he was arrested at a card game run by Soprano family capo Jimmy Altieri. He tried to escape but threw his back out and was caught. He was quickly bailed out, but was confined to his home due to injury. Dirty cop Vin Makazian told Tony he had a rat in his organization and pointed the finger at Sal. Tony assigned Paulie Gualtieri to investigate, and to kill Sal, but only if he saw explicit proof. At a bathhouse with Paulie, Sal refused to undress, blaming high blood pressure and alleging it would be bad for his back, but implying it could be because he was wearing a wire.

The bathhouse incident further raised the crew&#x27;s suspicions, especially when Sal disappeared soon afterwards. Paulie took over his collections, and the crew killed Altieri, whom the crew decided had been the rat. Sal resurfaced at Tony&#x27;s home in 2000, claiming to have been in Puerto Rico receiving treatment from an acupuncturist for his bad back. He started lying to Agent Lipari, showing reluctance to divulge details. Acquaintance Jimmy Bones spotted Sal with Agent Lipari, so Sal killed him to prevent him from telling what he knew. After Sal&#x27;s return, his wife Angie and he experienced relationship issues. Angie discussed leaving him with Carmela, who dissuaded her, so she settled for sleeping in separate bedrooms.

When Tony became acting boss, he made Silvio his consigliere, and Paulie a capo, with new addition Furio Giunta on equal footing with Sal despite Sal&#x27;s years of service. Sal wore a wire to A.J.&#x27;s confirmation, but he spent most of the time privately counseling A.J., instead of talking business with the crew. Following Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s shooting by associates Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, Sal resumed his loyal soldier role despite his double life as an informant; he tracked down the escaped Bevilaqua, and shot him to death with Tony. Sal eventually gave Agent Lipari information on Soprano&#x27;s stolen airline tickets scam, leading to Tony&#x27;s brief arrest.

Tony accepted his suspicions about Sal after a portentous dream in which Sal appeared to him as a talking fish, a clear reference to the Mafia-related saying &quot;sleep with the fishes&quot;. To be certain, he searched for evidence in Sal&#x27;s home and found a wire in a cigar box. He then organized a hit on Sal, with Silvio and Paulie, on a boat. After a last toast, Tony, Paulie, and Silvio shot Sal to death, wrapped his body in plastic bags, chains, and weights, and dumped it into the ocean. Sal made several appearances after his death in dreams or flashbacks. Tony and other members of his crew told Sal&#x27;s friends and family that he disappeared after entering the witness protection program.

====Silvio Dante====
====Anthony &quot;A.J.&quot; Soprano Jr.====
====Meadow Soprano====
====Paulie Gualtieri====
====Livia Soprano====
====Adriana La Cerva====
====Richie Aprile====
Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Aprile is played by David Proval. Richie is the older brother of acting DiMeo crime family boss Jackie Aprile Sr., and was a capo in the DiMeo crime family before being sent to prison for ten years. Richie was previously married and fathered a son, Richie Aprile Jr. Richie returned from prison to a very different family, with Tony Soprano as the boss, whom Richie had known since before Tony had become a made man. Richie feels he is entitled to more control and a higher ranking position in the family for having paid his dues in prison.

Tony promises to give Richie his due, an offer which Richie immediately rebuffs, saying Tony does not have the authority to do it. Richie&#x27;s tensions with Tony escalate throughout Season 2. One of Richie&#x27;s first actions as a free man is to confront his old partner Peter &quot;Beansie&quot; Gaeta and try to extort money from Beansie&#x27;s legitimate business investments. Later, Richie waits for Beansie to approach his car in the parking lot, then rams Beansie with his car, crushing Beansie between the two vehicles. Richie then drives over Beansie&#x27;s legs as he leaves.

Richie dislikes Tony&#x27;s protégé Christopher Moltisanti because of his violent relationship with Richie&#x27;s niece, Adriana La Cerva, and warns Christopher of the consequences should he ever hit her again while they are still unmarried. Christopher&#x27;s two young associates, Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, learn of Richie&#x27;s dislike for their boss, and shoot Christopher, hoping to impress Richie. The shooting goes wrong, however, and Christopher survives while Sean is killed. Richie had nothing to do with planning the hit, and when he learns of it, he refuses to help Bevilaqua and chases him off his premises waving a baseball bat.

Richie and Janice Soprano, Tony&#x27;s sister, used to date in high school. When Richie gets out of prison, he and Janice resume their old relationship and eventually get engaged. Janice frequently encourages Richie to defy Tony, because she wants to be married to the boss. In the end, Richie prepares, with the approval of Tony&#x27;s Uncle Junior, to take over the family as boss. Richie approaches acting capo Albert &quot;Ally Boy&quot; Barese to ask for his support in his takeover bid, but he declines.

After weighing his options, Junior realizes he is better off with Tony in charge and tips him off about Richie&#x27;s plans. Silvio Dante advises Tony that there is nothing to gain from leaving Richie alive, so Tony instructs Silvio to have Richie killed. However, after returning home one night, Richie gets into an argument with Janice over Richie&#x27;s son&#x27;s possible homosexuality, during which he punches her in the mouth before settling down for dinner.

Janice leaves the room and returns with a gun, shooting Richie twice and killing him. Distraught, she calls Tony, who has Christopher and Furio Giunta meet him to remove Richie&#x27;s body. They bring his corpse to Satriale&#x27;s to dismember it while Tony sends Janice off to Olympia, Washington to lie low.

====Janice Soprano====
====Artie Bucco====
Arthur &quot;Artie&quot; Bucco Jr. is played by John Ventimiglia. Artie is a restaurateur and chef, and childhood friend of Tony Soprano, attending elementary school together. Artie appears throughout the series, from the first episode to the penultimate episode. He and his wife, Charmaine Bucco, have three children: Chiara Bucco, Melissa Bucco, and Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Bucco III. Charmaine is frequently concerned about his attraction to Tony&#x27;s criminal life and often warns Artie about his occasional attempts at involvement.

Despite Artie and Tony&#x27;s close friendship, their relationship sees several low points. At the end of Season 1, Artie learns from Tony&#x27;s mother, Livia, that Tony was responsible for the arson at his original restaurant co-owned with his wife, Vesuvio, in Essex County, New Jersey. Tony&#x27;s Uncle Junior had planned to stage a hit at Vesuvio on &quot;Little Pussy&quot; Malanga, despite Tony&#x27;s repeated requests to move the location of the hit. Tony, knowing that the restaurant&#x27;s patrons would be permanently chased away if a hit occurred there, set the restaurant ablaze so that the hit would be avoided and Artie could rebuild the restaurant with the payout from his insurance policy.

Artie rebuilds the restaurant, renaming it Nuovo Vesuvio. However, Artie had a strong emotional attachment to the old restaurant, which he inherited from his father, and confronts Tony with a hunting rifle in the parking lot of Satriale&#x27;s when he finds out that Tony was responsible. Eventually, Artie believes Tony&#x27;s repeated denials of having been the arsonist. There is a brief tension between the two, but by the end of the Season 1 finale, they have made up.

In Season 3, Artie becomes infatuated with Adriana. When she quits working as a hostess at his restaurant, he unsuccessfully tries to court her. This causes a rift in his marriage to Charmaine and the two separate. In Season 4, Artie is approached by Frenchman Jean-Philippe, the brother of the new hostess at Vesuvio, for a $50,000 short-term loan to distribute Armagnac in the US. Artie agrees to lend him the money at high interest. He tries to borrow the money from Ralph, who declines but mentions it to Tony, who reminds Artie of their friendship and insists that he accept the loan from him.

Ten days pass and Jean-Philippe is not answering the phone. Artie goes to his home; Jean-Philippe says plainly that the deal has failed and there is no money. Artie attacks him. Jean-Philippe gets the better of him, rips out his earring, and throws him out. At home, Artie overdoses on alcohol and pills and calls Tony to apologize. Tony deduces that his friend is trying to kill himself and calls 911.

At the hospital, Tony says that Artie can clear his $6,000 tab at Nuovo Vesuvio in lieu of payment. Artie expresses admiration that Tony could intuitively foresee that the deal would go bad and so he would be able to profit from it; this makes Tony furious. Someone rings the bell at Jean-Philippe&#x27;s apartment. He opens the door: it is Furio.

In the third episode of Season 5, Tony learns that Artie has been living in a Motel 6 since the separation from his wife. Tony offers to let Artie stay in his mother&#x27;s old house, where Tony has been living since his separation from Carmela. Artie accepts, and the old friends reconcile. In Season 6, Artie and Charmaine reconcile. There is a growing sense of dissatisfaction amongst Nuovo Vesuvio&#x27;s diners, culminating in the episode &quot;Luxury Lounge&quot;.

Artie has hired another young hostess whom he lusts after—Martina, an undocumented Albanian immigrant he has been helping through the U.S. government&#x27;s immigration process. Soprano crew associate Benny Fazio is a regular fixture at the restaurant&#x27;s bar, flirting with Martina. The restaurant is losing many customers to the new rival restaurant, Da Giovanni&#x27;s. Nuovo Vesuvio&#x27;s finances worsen when American Express will not let its customers use its cards there, because several account numbers had been stolen and used to run up charges elsewhere. Artie confronts Martina, who instantly breaks, tearfully admitting to stealing, then passing, the charge card numbers to Benny.

Artie is enraged and storms to Benny&#x27;s house in the middle of the night. Benny tries to deny his involvement, and Artie starts a brawl, knocking Benny unconscious on his front porch. A furious Benny tells Tony he wants Artie dead, but Tony is able to keep him from doing so. Later, Artie appears to restore his business. Artie had also catered Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s belated bachelor party at Nuovo Vesuvio without coming into confrontation with Benny.

====Charmaine Bucco====
Charmaine Bucco is played by Kathrine Narducci. Charmaine is the wife of Artie Bucco and a childhood friend of Carmela and Tony Soprano. She co-owns the restaurant Nuovo Vesuvio with her husband. Charmaine runs the front of the house, and Artie is the head chef. Charmaine&#x27;s education is referenced periodically in the series: in &quot;The Test Dream&quot; it is revealed that she is a licensed notary public and in &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; it is revealed that she went to the Wharton School of Business. She and her husband have three children: Chiara Bucco, Melissa Bucco, and Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Bucco III.

In Season 1, Charmaine and Carmela drift apart. Charmaine resents that Carmela enjoys an affluent lifestyle that is only made possible by her husband&#x27;s criminal activities. She discourages Artie from associating with Tony because of his criminal lifestyle. When Carmela hires the Buccos to cater a silent auction fundraiser at the Soprano home, Carmela treats Charmaine like a servant. This prompts Charmaine to reveal that she dated and had sex with Tony in high school at the same time he was beginning to date Carmela when she was spending the summer with her parents on Long Beach Island.

Following a series of escalating arguments, Artie and Charmaine separate. Artie moves out of the family home, but the two still reluctantly run the business together. Charmaine ultimately reconciles with Artie in Season 6.

====Ralph Cifaretto====
Ralph &quot;Ralphie&quot; Cifaretto is portrayed by Joe Pantoliano. Ralph is not present in Season 1 or 2, as he spends a prolonged period of time in Miami, Florida, and lived in Delray Beach, Florida. Ralph first appears as a soldier in the Aprile Crew in the second episode of Season 3, &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot;. He is characterized as an excellent earner but also unstable and prone to violence. He returned to New Jersey in 2000, following the disappearance of Richie Aprile. As a high-ranking soldier, he tried to take over the crew despite Tony&#x27;s reluctance to make him captain, and often referred to it as &quot;my crew&quot;. Tony viewed Ralph as obnoxious and insubordinate, so he passed Ralph over for promotion, and made Gigi Cestone captain of the Aprile crew. After Cestone dies of a heart attack, Tony reluctantly installs Ralph as capo.

In the episode &quot;University&quot;, Ralph is involved with a 20-year-old stripper named Tracee, who becomes pregnant with his child. At the Bing, Tracee insults Ralph in front of his friends and makes fun of his perceived lack of masculinity. He follows her outside, where they argue. Ralph sweet-talks Tracee by telling her of a romantic future with their child which makes her happy, only for Ralph to insult her by telling her if their child is a girl, she should name her &quot;Tracee&quot; because she &quot;is going to become a cock-sucking slob, just like her mother.&quot; Tracee spits at him and slaps him in retaliation, and he brutally beats her to death. Tony finds out and strikes him repeatedly. Ralph defends himself by shouting, &quot;I&#x27;m a made guy!&quot; Tony justifies his actions by saying that Ralph &quot;disrespected the Bing&quot;.

Johnny Sack, a high-ranking member in the Lupertazzi family, once ordered a hit on Cifaretto for making an off-color joke about his wife&#x27;s obesity, although he later cooled down and called it off. Although unknown to Johnny Sack, his own hit was approved by Tony and Carmine in order to protect the highly valuable Esplanade project to which Ralph&#x27;s involvement was key. Ralph purchases a prize racehorse from Hesh Rabkin named Pie-O-My.

While Ralph only cares about the horse as a means to make money, Tony becomes emotionally attached to the horse. When Ralph&#x27;s son Justin is accidentally impaled in the chest with an arrow as part of a game, Ralph is devastated and turns to Father Intintola for guidance. After Pie-O-My dies in a stable fire under questionable circumstances, Tony confronts Ralph over the suspicious timing of the fire with the $200,000 insurance payout, which was used for his son&#x27;s medical expenses. Ralph denies the accusation, and rebukes and mocks Tony for being emotionally attached to the horse.

A fight ensues in Ralph&#x27;s kitchen during which Tony beats and strangles Ralph to death. Tony calls Christopher to dispose of the body. Chris dismembers Ralph&#x27;s body in his bathtub with a meat cleaver, after which he and Tony bury Ralph&#x27;s severed head, toupee, and hands on a farm inside a bowling bag, and throw his body, wrapped in canvas, weights and chains off a cliff into a flooded rock quarry, sinking it immediately.

====Eugene Pontecorvo====
Eugene Pontecorvo is portrayed by Robert Funaro. Eugene was a made man in the Aprile Crew. Hesh Rabkin mentions to Soprano family members that Eugene&#x27;s father committed suicide by inert gas asphyxiation in his vehicle at the age of 52. It is implied he is from North Bergen, New Jersey. Eugene was introduced on the show as an associate in the Soprano crime family in the episode &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot;. Eugene subsequently becomes a made man in the following episode &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; along with Christopher Moltisanti.

In Season 6&#x27;s premiere episode &quot;Members Only&quot;, Eugene inherited $2 million from his deceased aunt. He begins developing serious stress with his home life due to his wife pushing him to talk Tony into allowing them to retire to Fort Myers, Florida. When Eugene discusses this with Tony, Tony says he would think about it, but he states that Eugene took an oath, indicating that it is unlikely he will approve. Eugene attempts to bribe Tony with David Yurman watches for Tony, Carmela, Meadow and A.J. He again tries to coax Tony by handing him over a share of the inheritance.

Christopher Moltisanti assigns Eugene the task of killing Teddy Spirodakis in Boston who owed Christopher money and failed to pay him. Eugene is reluctant but must follow Christopher&#x27;s order due to his rank of capo. Chris assures Eugene that he will put in a good word for him to Tony as a favor for doing the hit. Eugene drives to Boston and finds Teddy eating dinner at a fast-food restaurant and shoots him repeatedly in the head. Eugene then walks out calmly.

It is revealed Eugene has been an informant and cooperating witness for the FBI, though it is unclear for how long. After Ray Curto dies of a massive stroke while giving potentially damaging information to Agent Robyn Sanseverino about Tony discussing a murder, the FBI informs Eugene they also refuse to allow him to move to Florida, as they need him as a material witness in New Jersey to help build a case against Tony in the wake of Curto&#x27;s death. Silvio informs Eugene that Tony denied his request to move to Florida. With Tony and the FBI both hindering his family&#x27;s chance to escape the mafia life, coupled with his stress at home and seeing it as the only way to allow his family to gain his inheritance and to move to Florida, Eugene hangs himself in his basement. Various characters give their opinion on his suicide but the nature of his death is never brought to Tony.

====Robert &quot;Bobby Bacala&quot; Baccalieri====
====Furio Giunta====
Furio Giunta is played by Federico Castelluccio. Furio is an Italian gangster, referred to as a zip, working for Tony Soprano. Furio first appears in Season 2 in &quot;Commendatori&quot; as Tony&#x27;s contact when visiting Italy who speaks both Italian and English. In Italy, Tony negotiates with the Neapolitan Camorra crime boss Annalisa Zucca for Furio to be transferred to New Jersey to work for him as part of an international car theft operation deal.

In order to get Furio a visa, Tony initially gets him a job as a mozzarella maker in the Nuovo Vesuvio Restaurant, enticing Artie Bucco with the idea that Tony will pay Furio&#x27;s salary and he does not have to be on the restaurant&#x27;s payroll. Furio becomes one of Tony&#x27;s most feared enforcers, intimidating and beating up multiple people who owe Tony money, as well as acting as Tony&#x27;s driver and bodyguard. Furio&#x27;s first assignment is to extract payment from a tanning salon owner whose wife has convinced him to withhold payment. He breaks the owner&#x27;s arm with a baseball bat and shoots him in the kneecap—all of which make a positive impression on Tony. In Season 3 in &quot;Amour Fou&quot;, Furio is shot in the leg by Jackie Aprile Jr. while Jackie and his friends Dino Zerilli and Carlo Renzi rob Ralph Cifaretto&#x27;s card game in an attempt to gain recognition amongst the crime family.

In Season 4 in &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, a sly Frenchman named Jean-Philippe talks Artie Bucco into temporarily lending him $50,000 for a business venture to distribute Armagnac in the US. Artie borrows the money from Tony Soprano, but when Artie goes to Jean-Philippe&#x27;s apartment to collect the money, he claims he does not have it and does not know when or if he is going to get it. Artie and Jean-Philippe scuffle briefly, but Artie leaves bruised and bloodied. Furio is later tasked with reclaiming Tony&#x27;s assumed debt from Jean-Philippe.

Furio eventually becomes infatuated with Tony&#x27;s wife, Carmela, who shares the same feelings. The two never truly become romantically entwined, which creates significant sexual tension between them. Carmela repeatedly finds excuses to visit Furio including assisting him in buying and decorating a house and planning a house-warming party. At the house-warming they share a sexually charged dance. Furio later claims he forgot his sunglasses at the Soprano house, just as a ploy to talk with Carmela.

When Furio&#x27;s father dies, he returns to Italy for the funeral. He seeks the advice of his uncle, another Mafia member, telling him that Italy no longer feels like home and that he is in love with his boss&#x27;s wife, feeling that they could truly communicate. His uncle makes it clear he has to move on or kill his boss. In the Season 4 penultimate episode &quot;Eloise&quot;, Furio witnesses Tony&#x27;s infidelity firsthand on a night out at a casino. A helicopter has been arranged to take them home and while Tony is urinating on the tarmac, Furio suddenly grabs him by his jacket and contemplates pushing Tony into the rear rotor blades of the helicopter. &quot;What the fuck you doin&#x27;?!&quot; exclaims Tony in a very inebriated voice. Furio then pulls him away and plays it off by telling Tony &quot;You were standing too close...&quot;.

Furio, no longer able to bear the burden that the internal conflict is causing him (that of his feelings conflicting with his honor, as well as his respect for the &quot;family&quot; hierarchy), abruptly sells his house and moves back to Italy. Carmela is devastated, and eventually reveals her feelings for him in an argument with Tony, to which Tony replies: &quot;If certain people see him, he&#x27;s a dead man&quot;. In Season 5, Tony claims to have people looking for him in Italy. Furio&#x27;s fate is ultimately left unclear.

====Johnny Sack====
John Sacrimoni, better known as Johnny Sack, is played by Vincent Curatola. He was the longtime underboss of Carmine Lupertazzi, the boss of the Brooklyn-based Lupertazzi crime family. Until he received a severance package, he operated largely out of Essany Scaffolding. Until incarcerated, Sacrimoni resided on a comfortable estate in North Caldwell, New Jersey. As underboss, he handled political payoffs and bid-rigging for the Lupertazzi organization.

Sacrimoni became boss after Carmine&#x27;s death, and was also a friend of Tony Soprano. His wife Ginny was obese, and he reacted violently to remarks about her weight. He once ordered a hit on Ralph Cifaretto for making one such off-color joke, although he later called it off. Although unknown to Johnny, Tony and Carmine approved a hit on him (later called off) in order to protect the highly valuable Esplanade project to which Ralphie&#x27;s involvement was key.

Johnny cultivated a friendship with Paulie Gualtieri, making use of him as a source of information about the Soprano family business. The relationship began when Paulie felt sidelined by Tony over the Esplanade construction project and proved most fruitful when Paulie was imprisoned in 2002 — a time when he felt particularly neglected by his friends. Johnny lied to Paulie — telling him that Carmine held him in high regard and often asked about him. This encouraged Paulie to place more faith in his friendship with Johnny than in the loyalty of his friends in the Soprano crime family. Through Paulie, Johnny learned about Tony&#x27;s Frelinghuysen Avenue property windfall and HUD scam — allowing the Lupertazzi crime family to demand a piece of the action because their mutual interests made both projects possible. It was also Paulie who told John about Ralphie&#x27;s insult about Ginny&#x27;s weight. After a chance meeting with Carmine, Paulie discovered that Carmine did not even know who he was. Angered by John&#x27;s deceit, Paulie became one of his biggest detractors.

Following Carmine&#x27;s 2004 death, Johnny&#x27;s crew engaged in a bitter war with Carmine&#x27;s son, Little Carmine. Johnny also threatened Tony Soprano&#x27;s family after Soprano&#x27;s cousin Tony Blundetto committed the unauthorized murder of Joseph &quot;Joey Peeps&quot; Peparelli, Johnny&#x27;s protégé, on behalf of Little Carmine. After both New York factions suffered heavy casualties, the conflict was brought to an end when Little Carmine surrendered control of the family. This was followed by Johnny&#x27;s tentative reconciliation with Tony Soprano, who had personally taken Tony Blundetto&#x27;s life to bury the hatchet.

Johnny&#x27;s time as boss was cut short when he was arrested by the FBI after the family&#x27;s consigliere, Jimmy Petrille, turned state&#x27;s evidence. While in jail awaiting trial, Johnny remained in control of the Lupertazzi family. In the sixth season, Johnny entrusted Phil Leotardo with the role of acting boss, while Johnny&#x27;s brother-in-law Anthony Infante acted as a back channel for communications. Ginny remained supportive, often visiting him in prison. Johnny became more selfish while imprisoned, disregarding the problems of subordinates while saying that his &quot;situation&quot; should take precedence.

He ordered Phil to maintain a good relationship with Tony and avoid starting a war over any business disputes, particularly the new office park construction project – another shared venture like the Esplanade project. Johnny was granted a six-hour release from prison to attend his daughter Allegra&#x27;s wedding, and agreed to cover the cost of U.S. Marshals and metal detectors. When the time came for Johnny to leave, he was reluctant to go, desiring to wait until his daughter and her new husband departed. However, the marshals blocked her limousine and dragged Johnny away in handcuffs, causing him to break down in tears. When Lupertazzi capo Rusty Millio continued to make trouble for Johnny, Johnny reached out to Tony for help, and Tony arranged a hit.

Johnny&#x27;s efforts to maintain control of his family ultimately proved futile. His lawyer, Ron Perse, floated the possibility of cooperating with the FBI, but John was quick to dismiss this. However, as the trial neared, Ron arranged a deal with the government on Johnny&#x27;s behalf. Facing a massive asset seizure that would have left both him and his beloved wife destitute, Johnny pleaded guilty to 47 RICO predicates in exchange for a reduced sentence of 15 years and a fine of $4.2 million, effectively ending his role as boss but leaving Ginny enough money to live comfortably.

As part of the deal, he was also required to give an allocution admitting his involvement in organized crime (although he did not reveal the names of any associates, just admitting the mere existence of La Cosa Nostra is a breach of omertà). Members of both the Soprano and Lupertazzi families were angered by his admission, believing that John should have stood trial and stayed silent instead of confirming his membership and rank in the Lupertazzi crime family. Once sentenced and incarcerated, Johnny was considered &quot;persona non grata&quot; among his former associates. Phil Leotardo, the former acting-boss during Johnny&#x27;s incarceration and now de facto boss of the Lupertazzi family, was particularly disgusted by his predecessor&#x27;s decision. Phil himself had previously stood trial and been sentenced to 20 years. Other mobsters including Richie Aprile, Tony Blundetto and &quot;Feech&quot; La Manna had all previously stood trial with lengthy sentences over their heads and never faltered.

During his incarceration, Johnny developed lung cancer. He died at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri not long after receiving a grim prognosis from an oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Phil subsequently threw a celebration to acknowledge his new position as boss of the Lupertazzi family.

====Vito Spatafore====
Vito Spatafore is played by Joseph R. Gannascoli. Vito was a soldier in the DiMeo crime family and a subordinate of Tony Soprano. He was married to Marie Spatafore, who was a second cousin to high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi family, Phil Leotardo, and had two children, Vito Jr., and Francesca. In the fifth season, it was revealed that Vito was a closeted homosexual. Gannascoli brought the idea to the writers of making his character gay based on the true story of Gambino crime family member Vito Arena, in the 1993 book &quot;Murder Machine&quot;. Gannascoli has said he saw the character as &quot;a cross between Mike Tyson and Liberace.&quot;

Although Vito Spatafore was not introduced on &quot;The Sopranos&quot; until the Season 2 episode &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot; as a nephew to fellow mobster Richie Aprile and cousin to Adriana La Cerva and Jackie Aprile Jr., Gannascoli appeared in the Season 1 episode, &quot;The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti&quot; as a pastry shop patron named &quot;Gino&quot;.

Vito is a member of the Aprile crew upon Richie&#x27;s release from prison and quickly rises through the ranks to capo after the deaths of capos Richie Aprile, Gigi Cestone and Ralph Cifaretto. In the Season 3 episode &quot;Another Toothpick&quot;, Vito&#x27;s brother, Bryan Spatafore, is violently beaten with a golf club by Salvatore &quot;Mustang Sally&quot; Intile, and put into a coma. Vito is vindictive and demands someone render Sal&#x27;s comeuppance. Tony Soprano enlists the help of Bobby Baccalieri&#x27;s father, Bobby Baccalieri Sr., to perform the hit on Mustang Sally.

In 2001, in the Season 3 finale episode &quot;Army of One&quot;, after Jackie Aprile Jr. had gone into hiding because he and his friends robbed Ralph Cifaretto&#x27;s card game to gain notoriety, Tony and Ralph agree that Aprile Jr. must be killed. Vito performs his first on-screen murder by shooting Jackie Jr. in the back of the head. In 2002, in the Season 4 episode &quot;Whoever Did This&quot;, Tony kills Cifaretto after he figures that Ralph was responsible for the death of their prized racehorse Pie-O-My for insurance money. Vito is subsequently promoted to capo of the Aprile Crew, as he was second-in-command. In 2004, in the Season 5 episode &quot;Unidentified Black Males&quot;, Vito was caught in the car of a security guard giving him oral sex early one morning at the Esplanade construction site by Meadow&#x27;s boyfriend, Finn DeTrolio. Vito intimidates Finn into silence.

By the Season 6 premiere &quot;Members Only&quot; in 2006, Vito has lost over 160 pounds to appear in a weight-loss commercial. In the episode &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Sacrimoni Request&quot;, during the wedding of Johnny Sack&#x27;s daughter, Allegra, Vito claimed he was not feeling well, and he and his family left the wedding. Back at home, Vito informed his wife he had to &quot;make some collections.&quot; Later, that night, while making a collection at a gay bar, two Lupertazzi family associates saw Vito in leather chaps dancing and kissing a man.

Vito attempted to play it off as a joke, but the two men were not convinced. Petrified of the consequences if his homosexuality were made public, Vito went into hiding. He fled to a bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire, and tried to pursue a new life away from the Mafia. Under the alias &quot;Vincent,&quot; he claimed to be writing a book. He contacted his family only once during a brief phone call. Discussing Vito with Carlo Gervasi, Tony says that Vito is a top earner for the family, and debates letting him come back to the family.

In New Hampshire, Vito develops a relationship with Jim &quot;Johnny Cakes&quot; Witowski who works as a volunteer fireman and as a short-order cook at a diner. Vito introduces himself initially as a sportswriter named Vincent from Scottsdale, Arizona and that he&#x27;s been divorced for a few years. He also attempted to live a heterosexual lifestyle and fathered one daughter with his wife. Vito and Jim soon form an attraction, though the two got into a fistfight outside a bar when Jim tried to kiss Vito and, still in denial about his homosexuality, Vito violently rebuffed him, calling him a fag.

The two soon reconcile after Vito decides to &quot;stop living a lie&quot; and became Jim&#x27;s live-in lover. The pair enjoyed romantic dinners, motorcycle rides, and picnicking lakeside. Jim gets Vito a job as a contractor working for some of his friends, a job which turns out to be very slow-paced. Ultimately, Vito missed his family and fast-paced lifestyle back in New Jersey too much to stay with Jim. Vito left Jim&#x27;s house early one morning to return to New Jersey while Jim was still asleep.

While driving back to New Jersey, a drunk Vito crashed his car into a parked vehicle. When he failed to convince the owner to keep the accident from the police, Vito shot and killed the man. Vito returned home and remained conflicted about whether or not to re-initiate contact with his old mafia family. Vito also later calls Jim, but Jim was still angry over the way Vito had left and wanted nothing more to do with him. Vito eventually approached Tony at a mall, while Vito&#x27;s brother, Bryan, kept watch. Vito claimed that his homosexual behavior had been caused by medication.

Wanting to &quot;buy himself back&quot; into the business, he offered Tony $200,000 and said he would run the family&#x27;s Atlantic City prostitution and drug businesses. Tony was tempted by the offer but realized this would bring him into open war with the Lupertazzis. Lupertazzi crime family boss Phil Leotardo, who disliked homosexuals, and who is a second cousin of Vito&#x27;s wife Marie, demanded Vito&#x27;s death, so Tony quietly arranged for Carlo Gervasi to make a hit on Vito. Meanwhile, Vito is reunited with his family, explaining his absence to his children by claiming that he was an undercover CIA agent hiding out in Afghanistan and warning them not to tell anybody.

That night, Vito returned to his motel room and was ambushed by Phil Leotardo and two of his soldiers, Gerry Torciano and &quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamiello. Torciano and Gamiello duct-taped Vito&#x27;s mouth shut and beat him to death with pool cues while Phil Leotardo watched. It was later revealed that Vito was found with a pool cue inserted into his anus, a message that he was killed because of his homosexuality. Phil&#x27;s unsanctioned murder of Vito proved to be a serious point of contention in his working relationship with Tony. The relationship was further strained when Phil correctly suspected the New Jersey mob of the disappearance of Gamiello, who had been killed by Silvio and Carlo Gervasi after making repeated wisecracks, in the wake of Vito&#x27;s death, about the sexual orientation of New Jersey mobsters and Carlo in particular.

Phil Leotardo later told Vito&#x27;s wife, Marie, that her husband was probably killed by two homosexual transients Vito had picked up at a bar. He told Marie that he loved Vito &quot;like a brother-in-law,&quot; and suggested that Vito&#x27;s death was probably for the best because a homosexual man would have made a poor role model for the children. However, a newspaper reported Vito was killed by mobsters after requesting to live an openly gay lifestyle. Vito&#x27;s children read the story, destroying the illusion of their father being a CIA agent.

A year later Vito&#x27;s son, Vito Jr. began to go through a rebellious phase in reaction to his father&#x27;s murder and cruelty from his peers in light of his father&#x27;s sexual orientation, entering the Goth subculture and performing various acts of vandalism. His mother, Marie, asked Tony Soprano for money so she could relocate her family to Maine, where no one would know them or what happened to Vito. Tony asked Phil Leotardo to intervene, because of his involvement in Vito&#x27;s death.

Both paid separate visits to Vito Jr. and told him to start acting more like an adult. Vito Jr. continued to act out, eventually to the point of getting expelled from school, so Tony decided to pay for the Spatafores to move. However, after gambling away most of the money he planned to give them, Tony instead paid for Vito Jr. to attend a boot camp for delinquents in Boise County, Idaho.

====Tony Blundetto====
Anthony &quot;Tony B&quot; Blundetto is played by Steve Buscemi. He is Tony Soprano&#x27;s maternal cousin who is released from prison at the beginning of the show&#x27;s fifth season. Upon release, Tony Blundetto begins to pursue a straight, non-criminal life. His second wife Gwen works in the field of actuarial science. However, he is eventually overpowered by the challenges of civilian life and turns back to crime, dragging the DiMeo crime family into the Lupertazzi crime family&#x27;s power struggle.

Blundetto is introduced in the second episode of Season 5, &quot;Rat Pack&quot;. Born in 1958, he is a cousin of Tony Soprano and Christopher Moltisanti. To distinguish between them, they were called &quot;Tony Uncle Johnny&quot; (Soprano) and &quot;Tony Uncle Al&quot; (Blundetto) when they were kids, after their fathers&#x27; first names. Blundetto, Soprano, and Moltisanti all grew up and played on a farm owned by their uncle, Pat Blundetto. Tony Soprano tells Blundetto that it was he who built the Soprano home in North Caldwell, New Jersey.

Growing up, both Tonys were very close and Blundetto told Moltisanti that he loved Soprano like a brother. The two Tonys would often bully Moltisanti. Blundetto is the father of Kelli Blundetto, who is Meadow&#x27;s contemporary and is said to have run away from home, and identical twin boys Justin and Jason Blundetto, whom he fathered by having Tony Soprano smuggle his semen out of prison nine years before, while still incarcerated. In the episode &quot;Unidentified Black Males&quot;, it is revealed that he has a genius-level I.Q. of 158. He sports a large number of crude prison tattoos, on his forearms, biceps, chest, back, and legs, including the name of his daughter Kelli and a tattoo representing the Roman god Mercury. Blundetto had a ruthless reputation in his younger years as an enforcer.

In 1986, at age 28, Blundetto was arrested, tried, and incarcerated for almost 17 years for the armed hijacking of a truck that was attached to a larger RICO racketeering trial. Soprano was supposed to go along with his cousin the night of the hijacking but was not able to make it due to a severe panic attack caused by an argument with his mother, during which he passed out and injured his head. Soprano tells Blundetto he was mugged by a group of black men the night of the hijacking and was knocked unconscious. Soprano strongly believes Blundetto holds some ill-will towards him because Blundetto&#x27;s life and family fell apart during his incarceration while Soprano grew wealthy and has a family. Blundetto denies this ill will, but Tony (Soprano) still harbors enormous guilt.

In 2004, Blundetto is released from Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood. After Blundetto&#x27;s parole, he decides not to return to a life of crime and has the incentive to stay straight and clean. Instead, he initially decides to go into massage therapy. Tony S is seemingly disappointed that Blundetto has decided to pursue a legitimate career after he declines Soprano&#x27;s offer to get started working with the DiMeo crime family in a stolen airbag scheme, but Soprano respects his cousin&#x27;s decision. Soprano gets his cousin a job working for a laundry company in Rutherford, New Jersey owned by a Korean man named Kim. Blundetto later goes into business with Kim in preparing to open a massage parlor and day spa in West Caldwell, New Jersey specializing in Shiatsu and Effleurage. Two days before they open, in an arbitrary fit of rage, he beats Kim. Blundetto then meets Soprano to restart work for the crime family under Carlo Gervasi&#x27;s crew.

Little Carmine&#x27;s crew simultaneously begins courting Blundetto through his old prison buddy, Angelo Garepe. Female loan shark Lorraine Calluzzo and her boyfriend/enforcer are killed by Phil Leotardo, his brother Billy and crew member Joey Peeps for siding with Little Carmine during the Lupertazzi power struggle between Carmine and Johnny Sack. In retaliation, Little Carmine loyalists Rusty Millio and Angelo Garepe offer a contract to Blundetto to murder Joey Peeps (&quot;Marco Polo&quot;). Although he is reluctant at first, he later accepts the contract after he decided that he is not moving up fast enough in the Soprano crime family. Blundetto shoots Joey and a prostitute he was seeing inside his car. Soprano later discovers that Blundetto committed the murder and confronts Blundetto, who claims innocence. Although Soprano knows the truth, he tells Johnny Sack that he does not know who the killer was.

In &quot;The Test Dream&quot;, Phil and Billy Leotardo kill Angelo in retribution for Peeps&#x27; death. This drives Blundetto into a rage, and he tracks down the Leotardo brothers, wounding Phil and killing Billy. By the end of Season 5, Tony Soprano is under heavy pressure to deliver his cousin to Johnny Sack (who has taken over his crime family after Little Carmine&#x27;s abdication), explicitly so he can be tortured and killed by Phil Leotardo. After one of Soprano&#x27;s associates Benny Fazio is badly beaten by Phil, Tony Soprano realizes that he is putting everyone in his crime family in jeopardy by protecting his cousin.

Tony Soprano is able to track down Blundetto at their uncle Pat Blundetto&#x27;s farm and kills him with a shotgun in order to prevent his torture at the hands of Phil. He then gives Blundetto&#x27;s location to Johnny Sack. Later, Phil arrives to find Blundetto already dead and is furious to be deprived of his vengeance. Tony Soprano then tells Christopher to bury Blundetto secretly, and in one piece, off the premises. Tony and Johnny reach an accord over Blundetto&#x27;s demise, although Phil remains unsatisfied.

====Rosalie Aprile====
Rosalie &quot;Ro&quot; Aprile is played by Sharon Angela. Rosalie is the widow of Jackie Aprile Sr., who died of cancer, and the mother of Jackie Aprile Jr. and Kelli Aprile. She is good friends with mob wives Carmela Soprano and Gabriella Dante, to whom she offers characteristically frank advice. One year after Jackie Sr.&#x27;s death, she started a relationship with mobster Ralph Cifaretto. Ralph encouraged Jackie Jr. as he became more and more involved in the family business, providing him with a gun, accepting payments from him, involving him in making collections, and offering advice. Jackie Jr. tried to make a name for himself by robbing a card game, but the heist went awry.

Tony and Ralph decided that Jackie Jr. had to be killed, unbeknownst to Rosalie. The hit was carried out by Vito Spatafore, but Rosalie and the rest of the family were told that Jackie was killed by black drug dealers. Following her son&#x27;s death, Rosalie sank into a prolonged period of mourning. Ralph began an affair with Janice Soprano, and Ralph soon broke up with Rosalie, claiming he was tired of her constant grief. Rosalie, angered by his selfishness, ordered him out of her home. Rosalie accompanied Carmela on a trip to Paris in the Season 6 episode &quot;Cold Stones&quot;. While there, she pursued a brief relationship with a much younger Frenchman named Michel.

====Patsy Parisi====
Pasquale &quot;Patsy&quot; Parisi is played by Dan Grimaldi. Patsy is a soldier in Tony Soprano&#x27;s crew, and is often seen calculating the group&#x27;s finances in the Bada Bing or Satriale&#x27;s offices. He and Burt Gervasi run the North Ward Emergency Merchants Protective Cooperative: an extortion racket hitting storeowners in parts of Newark.

Patsy had an identical twin brother, Phillip &quot;Philly Spoons&quot; Parisi (also played by Dan Grimaldi), who had a hit taken out on him by Tony, and was killed by Soprano soldier Gigi Cestone. Patsy was born March 4, 1950, 11 minutes before his brother Phillip in Bloomfield, New Jersey. At the time, Philly was acting capo of Junior Soprano&#x27;s crew and Patsy was a member. Patsy never had concrete evidence about his brother&#x27;s murder, but it occurred soon after a brief and bloody war between Junior and Tony, and Philly was known to be talking about Tony&#x27;s actions.

It was this killing that prompted Tony to move Patsy to keep an eye on him. Patsy took the killing very hard, which brought on a problem with alcoholism. In 2000, a drunken Patsy was observed by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents outside the Soprano family home leveling a gun at Tony through his window. He reconsidered though, and only urinated in the Sopranos&#x27; pool. Patsy also openly vented his feelings of loss to the Soprano crew in front of the men responsible for his brother&#x27;s death, Gigi and Tony, at a lunch in the back of Satriale&#x27;s. He eventually put his grief behind him. Patsy still has questionable loyalties.

When Patsy&#x27;s then capo Paulie Gualtieri was imprisoned in 2002, Tony promoted Christopher Moltisanti to acting captain over Patsy. Patsy did not take this well, eventually getting into a fight with Christopher. When Paulie was released and promoted to underboss, Christopher was made capo permanently. In the penultimate episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, Patsy is nearly killed by two men sent to murder Silvio Dante. Patsy manages to hold them off, but Silvio is badly wounded and put into a coma, while Patsy runs into the woods fleeing for his life. Patsy later celebrates his son&#x27;s looming engagement to Meadow Soprano with Tony and his family.

In a deleted scene from Season 2 where it is revealed that Philly Parisi is Junior Soprano&#x27;s godson, it is mentioned that he (and, thus, Patsy) is Tony&#x27;s maternal cousin.

====Gabriella Dante====
Gabriella Dante is played by Maureen Van Zandt. Gabriella is married to longtime DiMeo crime family soldier and consigliere Silvio Dante (portrayed by real-life husband Steven Van Zandt). They have a daughter, Heather Dante, who played volleyball and soccer with Meadow Soprano. She is close friends with Rosalie Aprile and Carmela Soprano and can often be seen dining out with them, typically at &quot;Nuovo Vesuvio&quot;. In 2006, when Tony was shot, Silvio became acting boss of the family. Gabriella was supportive of her husband in this role and ambitious enough to encourage him to consider the possibility of it long-term.

====Angie Bonpensiero====
Angie Bonpensiero (née Belfiore) is played by Toni Kalem. Angie is married to Sal &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero whom she married in 1976. They have three children, Kevin, Matt, and Terri. Angie was unaware of her husband&#x27;s status as an FBI informant. His disappearance when he was afraid Tony Soprano became suspicious, and subsequent erratic behavior, created problems for their relationship. When she and her husband were having marital problems, Angie considered both suicide and divorce.

When her husband returned, she was being tested for breast cancer. At Carmela&#x27;s urging to stay true to her Catholic faith, Angie decided to move into a separate bedroom rather than end their marriage. In 2000, after Tony Soprano confirmed his suspicions by finding tapes in Big Pussy&#x27;s cigar box, he is killed. Tony continued to compensate Angie in her husband&#x27;s absence–but she used the money to buy a new car, but still complained to Carmela about her strained finances, prompting Tony to cease her allowance.

Later, Carmela runs into Angie working at a grocery store after having lost contact. Tony later made Angie the manager of Big Pussy&#x27;s body shop. After a long period of time without talking, she and Carmela decide to end their quarrel and go out to dinner. Shortly after the reconciliation, Carmela learns that Angie is putting money out on the street via Patsy Parisi and Benny Fazio for loan sharking and they are using their connections to help her with the body shop.

====Butch DeConcini====
Butch DeConcini is played by Gregory Antonacci. He is from Flatbush, Brooklyn. Butch is a high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi crime family, first appearing in the show as a capo and later being promoted to underboss under Phil Leotardo. He attended Little Carmine Lupertazzi&#x27;s &quot;meeting of minds&quot; to try to resolve a dispute with the Soprano crime family in 2006 after Tony responded to the murder of Vito Spatafore by blowing up a wire room in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn that was owned by Phil.

After the effort failed, DeConcini was vocal in his desire to move against Tony. When Phil refused to consider killing a boss, it was Butch who suggested they move on someone else in Tony&#x27;s family. When Phil ordered a hit on Faustino &quot;Doc&quot; Santoro to take over the Lupertazzi family, it was Butch who oversaw the assassination behind the wheel of one of the getaway cars. Upon Phil&#x27;s permanent elevation to boss, Butch was made underboss of the family.

Alongside Albie Cianflone, Butch is one of Phil&#x27;s primary confidants and advisors. Butch fails to eliminate the Soprano family leadership, and he notices Phil&#x27;s threatening tone regarding his future due to the failure to find and murder Tony. During a sit-down with Tony and Paulie Gualtieri, he, along with Albie Cianflone and Little Carmine, agree to end the war against the Soprano family. While Butch will not reveal where Phil is hiding, he gives consent on behalf of the Lupertazzi family for Tony to hunt down and murder Phil, which he does.

====Benny Fazio====
Benito &quot;Benny&quot; Fazio Jr. is played by Max Casella. Benny is a soldier who began working for the DiMeo crime family with Christopher Moltisanti under capo Paulie Gualtieri, and continued to work for Chris after Chris&#x27;s elevation to caporegime. Benny debuted in the third episode of Season 3, with his release from jail and renewed association with Christopher. He has a no-show job as a United Association plumber. He began working for Christopher just after Christopher became a made man in 2001.

Later, Jackie Aprile Jr. informed Fazio and Moltisanti of an opportunity to rob a Jewel concert at Rutgers University. Benny and Chris committed the robbery and made a clean escape with Jackie driving. In 2002, Benny was awarded one of the &quot;no-work&quot; United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America jobs at the Esplanade construction site. He was assigned the task of killing two would-be assassins contracted by Tony to whack New York City boss Carmine Lupertazzi after the hit was called off. Benny and Petey LaRosa ambushed and killed the hitmen—two black heroin dealers, Credenzo Curtis and Stanley Johnson—who were set up by Christopher Moltisanti.

In late 2004, Benny was seriously beaten by Lupertazzi capo Phil Leotardo. The crisis brought on by Tony Blundetto was reaching a breaking point and Phil severely beat Benny to send a message to Tony. Tony, feeling guilty about Benny&#x27;s fractured skull, offered to give Benny his button when he recovered, meaning he would become a made man.

Benny is married to Jen Fazio, who is pregnant. However, Benny began an affair with Martina, a new hostess at Nuovo Vesuvio, much to the irritation of the owner and head chef Artie Bucco who had his eye on her. Benny was involved in Chris&#x27;s credit card fraud scheme with Ahmed and Muhammad, using his relationship with Martina to get account numbers from Nuovo Vesuvio customers and sell them on through Soprano crew associate James &quot;Murmur&quot; Zancone. Benny gives Tony a tribute payment.

American Express investigated Nuovo Vesuvio restaurant&#x27;s role in the credit card fraud and pulled the restaurant&#x27;s authority to accept American Express cards. Artie is able to figure out that Martina is the criminal in his staff through her relationship with Benny. Artie then angrily drives to Benny&#x27;s home to confront him; the ensuing fight sent Benny to the hospital. Benny is set on killing Artie, but Tony intervenes, insisting Benny&#x27;s parents have their anniversary dinner at Nuovo Vesuvio, and that the two make amends. Artie makes a table-side visit during their meal.

In front of Benny&#x27;s pregnant wife, Artie makes an innuendo to Benny&#x27;s extramarital affair with Martina by asking Benny if he wants a &quot;Martina,&quot; explaining that it is an Albanian martini (Martina is Albanian) and adding &quot;Well, apparently they go down real easy. Right, Ben?&quot; Enraged, Benny follows Artie to the kitchen and holds his arm in a pot of boiling tomato sauce, burning him badly, and also rams his head into the counter. Benny later attended Chris&#x27;s belated bachelor party, also at Nuovo Vesuvio and hosted by Artie, but the two refrained from initiating further violence.

Benny helped guard Tony while he was in hiding from Phil Leotardo. Benny and several of Tony&#x27;s other crew members were checking gas stations to find Phil Leotardo after being tipped off by Agent Harris that Phil was using a payphone at a gas station in the area. In the series finale, Benny is last seen acting as the getaway driver when Walden Belfiore shot Phil Leotardo to death at a gas station in Oyster Bay, Long Island.

====Little Paulie Germani====
Paul &quot;Little Paulie&quot; Germani is played by Carl Capotorto. Germani is thought to be the nephew (later revealed to actually be a first cousin once removed) and right-hand of Soprano family captain Paulie Gualtieri. Germani is an associate and later soldier in the Moltisanti crew. Germani regularly hangs out with Christopher and accompanies him on debt collections visits. In Season 4, Germani was tasked with vandalizing Carmine Lupertazzi&#x27;s restaurant when Tony and Carmine got into a dispute over the HUD scam.

He was responsible for intimidating Alan Sapinsly after Tony&#x27;s separation caused him to withdraw from a contract to buy property from Sapinsly. Paulie and Benny used Tony&#x27;s home entertainment system speakers on his boat to blast Dean Martin recordings at the Sapinsly home at all hours. In Season 5, Little Paulie holds a &quot;no work&quot; job at the Esplanade construction site and accompanied Chris when collecting a loan from writer J.T. Dolan.

Early in Season 4, Germani precipitates the crisis between Tony and Johnny Sack, when he hears Ralph Cifaretto make a joke about the obesity of Johnny Sack&#x27;s wife, and repeats this joke to Paulie Gualtieri, who relays the news of this to Johnny. In the Season 6 episode &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;, Little Paulie is badly hurt after being pushed out of a second-story window by Christopher during a feud with Paulie. He suffers six broken vertebrae. He helps in the war with the Lupertazzi crime family, disguising himself as a police officer while searching for Phil Leotardo.

====Little Carmine Lupertazzi====
Carmine &quot;Little Carmine&quot; Lupertazzi Jr. is played by Ray Abruzzo. Little Carmine is a capo and the son of Carmine Lupertazzi, the leader of one of New York&#x27;s Five Families. He followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a member of the Lupertazzi family at an early age. Little Carmine also has interests in several legitimate businesses including nightclubs in South Beach, Miami and a scaffolding contractor company in New York and New Jersey with control of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in addition to receiving proceeds from illicit activities.

He moved with his wife and daughter to Florida in 2000, along with his criminal operations, and splits time between Miami Beach, Florida and New York. While Little Carmine is initially portrayed as a pretentious, spoiled mobster whose constant malapropisms convey poor intellect, he later assumes an elder-statesmen role, frequently mediating disputes that arise in the Lupertazzi crime family. Little Carmine is introduced in Season 4 when Tony Soprano visits him in Miami to seek his counsel in settling a dispute between Carmine Sr. and Johnny Sack.

In the beginning of Season 5, Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. has a massive stroke and dies a few days later. Little Carmine immediately comes up to New York from Florida to see his father before he passes, and quickly becomes embroiled in a power struggle with Johnny Sack. Since Little Carmine is the son of the former boss, he has &quot;de facto&quot; claim to the throne, much to Johnny&#x27;s anger as he has been Carmine Sr.&#x27;s long-time second in command. Even Tony has no faith in Little Carmine&#x27;s capacity to run New York, jokingly referring to him as &quot;Brainless the Second&quot;. Despite his shortcomings, Little Carmine finds backers in Carmine Sr.&#x27;s recently paroled former consigliere, Angelo Garepe, and long-time Lupertazzi Capo Rusty Millio. Angelo and Rusty, along with Rusty&#x27;s right-hand man Eddie Pietro, pull most of the strings during the war between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine.

However, after a cycle of bloodshed that escalates into war, Little Carmine ultimately finds it difficult to stomach the continuing violence and abdicates. His decision is heavily influenced when the Leotardo brothers assassinate Angelo as retaliation for the death of Joey Peeps. With Little Carmine&#x27;s capitulation, Johnny Sack becomes the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family. After this, Little Carmine keeps a low profile and is no longer seen as a threat. Johnny is arrested soon after by the FBI, who are acting on information given to them by Johnny&#x27;s trusted ally and long-time Lupertazzi Captain Jimmy Petrille.

With Johnny in federal custody during his federal racketeering trial, Phil Leotardo becomes the acting boss in New York. By season six, Little Carmine is brought in as an investor on Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s movie project, &quot;Cleaver&quot;. Little Carmine is instrumental in organizing a meeting with Sir Ben Kingsley in Los Angeles to court his interest in the project, but Kingsley eventually passes on the lead role. Little Carmine had helped Kingsley&#x27;s booking agent out of some trouble he had down in the Florida Keys.

Little Carmine continues to get involved in crime family affairs. He tries to help resolve a longstanding feud between the Lupertazzi crime family and the Soprano crime family. After Phil becomes boss, tensions escalate between the two crime families and Little Carmine makes a last effort to resolve it. Phil is less generous in business dealings with the New Jersey family and still harbors anger over Tony&#x27;s cousin killing Phil&#x27;s brother Billy.

When the conflict eventually escalates into a war between the two families, Little Carmine and Tony both turn to a neutral party, George Paglieri, to broker a negotiation between Tony and Butch DeConcini, the street boss for Leotardo while he is in hiding. At a sitdown with Little Carmine, Butch, Albie Cianflone, Tony, and Paulie Gualtieri, everyone agrees that the war has gone too far and that Phil&#x27;s decisions have led to negative consequences on both sides. Butch agrees to back off while the Soprano family hunts down Phil.

====Carlo Gervasi====
Carlo Gervasi is played by Arthur J. Nascarella. Carlo was a capo in the DiMeo crime family. He was promoted to caporegime of James &quot;Little Jimmy&quot; Altieri&#x27;s crew after Jimmy was murdered on suspicion of being an FBI informant, and was put in charge of obtaining grey-market goods from container ships docking at the Newark ports. He is introduced in Season 4. In Season 6, Carlo begins to emerge from the background and become a more prominent character. Carlo took over Vito Spatafore&#x27;s construction business in addition to the ports, after the revelation of Vito&#x27;s homosexuality, his subsequent disappearance, and later his ultimate fate.

When Tony decided that Spatafore had to be killed to appease acting New York City boss Phil Leotardo, and Silvio Dante asked if the hit should be assigned to anyone in particular, Soprano suggested Carlo for the job. However, Spatafore was beaten to death by Phil Leotardo&#x27;s men Gerry Torciano and Dominic &quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamiello before Carlo could act. Carlo later avenged his family&#x27;s honor by stabbing Fat Dom four times with a large chef&#x27;s knife for making jokes about Spatafore&#x27;s murder and implying that Carlo was also homosexual. The killing occurred in the back room of Satriale&#x27;s pork store, with Silvio taking part. Tony Soprano later discovered them waiting to dispose of the body and was angry because of the murder&#x27;s possible repercussions.

Carlo took charge of disposing of Gamiello&#x27;s body and drove to Connecticut to deposit his head in a storm drain, phoning Silvio to confirm that the last part was safely away and to ask about Tony&#x27;s plans to blow up Phil&#x27;s wire room. Carlo&#x27;s son Jason attends Rutgers University, where he is involved in gambling and loansharking. Carlo&#x27;s cousin, Burt, switched sides during the Lupertazzi/Soprano war and was killed for his disloyalty by Silvio Dante.

In the series finale, Carlo&#x27;s son was said to be arrested by the FBI for drug dealing. Gervasi failed to show up for a meeting with Paulie Gualtieri, which worried Tony that he may have been cutting a deal with the police. Tony&#x27;s attorney confirmed that someone was going to testify before a grand jury and that indictments were forthcoming. In the final scene, Tony told Carmela that Carlo was testifying, confirming that he had turned informant, likely in a deal to keep his son out of jail.

====Phil Leotardo====
Phil Leotardo is played by actor Frank Vincent. Phil is a high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi crime family and the primary antagonist of the final two seasons of the show. Originally a captain, following the death of the original boss, Carmine Lupertazzi, the imprisonment and death of his successor Johnny Sacrimoni, and a brief power struggle with would-be boss Faustino &quot;Doc&quot; Santoro, Phil becomes the boss of the family. His inability to forgive the death of his brother at the hands of Tony&#x27;s cousin, Tony Blundetto—even after Blundetto&#x27;s own murder—forms one of the central conflicts of the series, with Leotardo aiming to kill Tony and cripple his entire organization in revenge. Leotardo had an alleged 27 hits to his credit.

He quickly rejoined the Lupertazzi crime family, of Brooklyn, New York, once he was released from prison. Phil was married to Patty Leotardo and was a second cousin of Marie Spatafore. Phil bore a resemblance to the last Shah of Iran, leading to Tony Soprano and the DiMeo crime family often referring to him as &quot;The Shah&quot;. Leotardo claimed when his grandfather immigrated from Sicily, officials changed their last name at Ellis Island from Leonardo to Leotardo.

Following Carmine Sr.&#x27;s death, a power struggle between two factions ensued. One side was led by Carmine&#x27;s underboss, Johnny Sack, while the other was ostensibly led by Carmine&#x27;s only son and Miami capo Little Carmine Lupertazzi. Phil became Johnny&#x27;s right-hand man during the war and carried out murders in order to weaken Little Carmine&#x27;s resolve. Phil performed a mock execution of Lorraine Calluzzo, while she was tightly taped and gagged, shooting at her while holding a phone book in the path of the bullet, to persuade her to redirect her payments from Little Carmine to Johnny Sack.

When she failed to comply Phil returned with his younger brother, Billy Leotardo, and Joey Peeps, who killed Lorraine. When Peeps was later killed by Tony&#x27;s cousin Tony Blundetto, Phil and Billy murdered Angelo Garepe in response. Phil became personally involved in the war when his brother Billy was murdered by Blundetto as revenge for the hit the Leotardo brothers carried out on Angelo, who was Blundetto&#x27;s close friend. Little Carmine ultimately found it difficult to stomach the continuing violence and abdicated.

After Little Carmine&#x27;s capitulation, Johnny Sack became the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family and Phil ascends to the position of underboss. After this, Little Carmine kept a low profile and was no longer seen as a threat. Johnny Sack was arrested soon after by the FBI, acting on information given to them by Johnny&#x27;s trusted ally and consigliere Jimmy Petrille. With Johnny in federal custody during his federal racketeering trial, Phil Leotardo became the acting boss in New York.

Soprano initially protected Blundetto against Phil. Phil stalked New Jersey looking for Blundetto, hounding Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s mother Joanne and badly beating Soprano associate Benny Fazio. When it became clear that Tony&#x27;s men would not allow themselves to be imperiled for no good reason, Tony was forced to act. Tony ultimately murdered his own cousin to save his family and give Blundetto a quick and painless death after Johnny Sack had made it clear that Phil would torture Blundetto if he found him. Phil was angered that his opportunity for vengeance was stolen. At a meeting between the two bosses, Johnny and Tony made peace, but the moment was interrupted by Johnny&#x27;s arrest by the FBI, while Tony escaped. With Johnny in federal custody, Phil became acting boss of the Lupertazzi family.

Phil worked closely with Tony and Vito Spatafore, the husband of his cousin, on the two families’ joint construction efforts. When Vito&#x27;s homosexuality was publicly revealed in Season 6, Phil visited Marie to find out if she knew where Vito was (he had gone into hiding in New Hampshire). When she pleaded for mercy for her husband, he told her they just wanted to get Vito help. Phil also harassed Tony about his efforts to find Vito.

Vito later returned to New Jersey after he could not adjust to life outside of the mob, and met Tony to offer to buy his way back into the family. Tony refused but did not attempt to harm Vito. Tony had arranged for Carlo Gervasi to execute Vito at the mall early in the morning on the pretense that Vito was supposedly meeting up with Tony, to straighten out the situation, however when Vito returned to his motel, Phil&#x27;s soldiers Gerry Torciano and Dominic &quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamielleo ambushed him as he walked through the door.

Phil emerged from the closet, slowly walked up to Vito who was being held by Gerry and Fat Dom, and sat down on the bed. He looked Vito in the eye and said, &quot;You&#x27;re a fucking disgrace.&quot; And with that, Fat Dom and Gerry Torciano proceeded to beat Vito to death. Subsequently, with having made his cousin Marie a widow, Phil balked when Tony reached out to him for restitution for Marie and refused. Phil told Marie that her husband was probably killed by two homosexual transients Vito had picked up at a bar.

Fat Dom was murdered by an enraged Carlo Gervasi during a visit to Satriale&#x27;s after making repeated wisecracks, in the wake of Vito&#x27;s death, about the sexual orientation of New Jersey mobsters. Leotardo, while on a date with his Ukrainian housemaid (Yaryna Kastropovich), approached one of his Brooklyn businesses, only to be blown off of his feet by a bomb planted in the building. After an unsuccessful attempt by Little Carmine Lupertazzi to broker peace between the families, Leotardo and his crew plotted revenge.

Although Phil balked at the idea of killing Tony himself, captain Butch DeConcini seemingly persuaded him to target someone important to the DiMeo family. However, their planning was cut short when Phil suffered a late-night heart attack and was hospitalized during Christmas 2006. Once he recovered, Phil decided to step down as boss to make way for his protégé Gerry Torciano in charge. Yet Phil did not strongly back Torciano as successor, and Lupertazzi underboss Doc Santoro soon made his own bid for power by having Torciano murdered.

After deciding to get back in the game, Phil waited, working under Doc Santoro until the old man&#x27;s arrogance got too much to handle. As Phil sat down to dinner with Doc to acknowledge him as boss, Doc humiliated Phil by literally taking food from his plate. Knowing that he had broad support, including Tony&#x27;s, Phil ordered a hit on Santoro. Driven by Butch DeConcini, Phil&#x27;s crew murdered Santoro and an associate outside a massage parlor, leaving him dead on the sidewalk. After the assassination, Phil was permanently elevated to boss of the Lupertazzi family, with Cianflone cemented as consigliere and DeConcini as underboss.

After Tony viciously beat one of Phil&#x27;s men, Coco, for making lewd comments to his daughter Meadow, Phil refused to meet with Tony and launched a war against the DiMeo family. In the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, the Soprano Family used Corky Caporale again through Patsy Parisi to target Phil Leotardo. Fluent in Italian, Corky assigned Neapolitan hitmen, Italo and Salvatore, but the hit was botched when they mistake Alec Kastropovich, the father of Leotardo&#x27;s Ukrainian mistress for Leotardo. Leotardo&#x27;s order was that New York is to &quot;decapitate&quot; New Jersey and do business with what&#x27;s left. He instructed that hits be made on Tony, Bobby Baccalieri, and Silvio Dante. Bobby is killed and Silvio is wounded badly and left in a coma. Tony goes into hiding with the remainder of the family.

In the &quot;Sopranos&quot; series finale, &quot;Made in America&quot;, Butch DeConcini and Albie Cianflone arranged a sit down with Tony and Paulie, where they expressed their dissatisfaction with Phil&#x27;s leadership and agreed to a ceasefire of the war. Butchie said he will not reveal the location of Phil but then said, &quot;You do what you got to do&quot;—this following a recent phone conversation with Butchie and Phil, where Phil implied a threat to Butchie over his inability to find Tony Soprano. Shortly thereafter, the location of Leotardo was made known to Tony by information from Agent Harris in exchange for terrorism information on Ahmed and Muhammad.

Hiding in Oyster Bay, Long Island, Leotardo was shown talking to his wife through a car window at a gas station when he was suddenly shot in the head by Walden Belfiore, a soldier in the Gervasi crew of the DiMeo family. Leaving their grandchildren in her Ford Explorer, Leotardo&#x27;s wife rushed to Phil&#x27;s side in a panic. Unattended and still in drive with the engine running, the car idled forward, and a tire rolled over and crushed Phil&#x27;s head. Leotardo&#x27;s murder was the 92nd and final death in the series.

==Recurring characters==
The following is a list of characters that are, or at one time were, recurring guests on the series; they are listed in the order that they first appeared on the show.

===Recurring character biographies===
====Hesh Rabkin====
Herman &quot;Hesh&quot; Rabkin is played by Jerry Adler. In June 2020, casting directors Georgianne Walken and Sheila Jaffe said that Jerry Stiller had been originally set to play Hesh, but due to scheduling issues, Adler was cast quickly. Hesh is a loan shark and advisor to Tony Soprano; the same role he performed for Tony&#x27;s father, mob captain Johnny Soprano. Hesh is a Jewish businessman who made his initial fortune in the recording industry, founding &quot;F-Note Records&quot; during the 1950s and 1960s, bringing many young black musicians to prominence, and receiving royalties by being fraudulently credited as a co-writer on many songs. He first appeared in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (&quot;Pilot&quot;). Hesh is thought to be a composite character, inspired by real life music mogul Morris &quot;Mo&quot; Levy, the founder of Roulette Records with connections to the Mafia, who owned a string of racehorses.

Hesh first appeared while working with Tony on setting up a scam to defraud HMO medical insurance companies through their debtor, Alex Mahaffey. Hesh accompanied Big Pussy to a waterfall to intimidate Mahaffey into participating. Later, Hesh advised Tony against getting involved with the Teitlemanns, a family of Hasidic Jews, in a dispute over ownership of their hotel. Hesh&#x27;s predictions of their obstinacy proved correct. Hesh was able to help Tony end a particularly arduous &quot;negotiation&quot; with a threat of castration.

In &quot;A Hit Is a Hit,&quot; Hesh helped Tony&#x27;s nephew Christopher Moltisanti to realize his girlfriend, Adriana La Cerva, had little aptitude for work in the music business. Chris made contact with Hesh on behalf of Massive Genius, a rapper who claimed Hesh owed compensation to the widow of a black musician he allegedly defrauded. Hesh also sold Ralph Cifaretto the ill-fated racehorse, Pie-O-My. In the final season premiere, &quot;Members Only&quot;, Hesh and his son-in-law, Eli, were attacked by members of Phil Leotardo&#x27;s crew. They targeted Eli because they thought he was making collections on their turf without permission, so they set fire to Eli&#x27;s gas tank to get him and Hesh out of the car, and then set about beating Eli. Eli was then seriously hurt in a hit-and-run accident, while trying to escape the mobsters, and Hesh was punched in the face.

In the episode &quot;Chasing It&quot;, Hesh gives Tony a $200,000 bridge loan to help Tony cover a string of gambling losses. Tony fails to repay the loan on time and starts berating Hesh about the vig on the loan, which was $3,000 per week. When Hesh&#x27;s girlfriend, Renata, dies of a stroke, Tony offers brief, impersonal words of sympathy, repays Hesh&#x27;s $200k loan, and immediately leaves, seemingly signaling the end of their friendship. This is Hesh&#x27;s last appearance on the show.

====Alex Mahaffey====
Alex Mahaffey is played by Michael Gaston. He is a &quot;degenerate gambler&quot; in debt to Tony and Hesh Rabkin, an old Jewish friend of Tony&#x27;s father, Johnny. Tony concocts a scheme for Mahaffey&#x27;s company to make insurance claims payable to non-existent clinics in order to pay off his debts. Realizing that he would die if he refused, Mahaffey complies with the fraud.

====Giacomo &quot;Jackie&quot; Aprile ====
Giacomo Michael &quot;Jackie&quot; Aprile is played by Michael Rispoli. He was born in 1955, and rose through the ranks of the DiMeo Crime Family with his older brother Richie and close friend Tony Soprano. Jackie was the brother of Liz La Cerva, and the uncle of Adriana La Cerva. Jackie and Tony, along with Silvio Dante and Ralph Cifaretto, belonged to a small crew moving weed and stolen goods. Around this time, Jackie had the idea to rob a card game held by capo Michele &quot;Feech&quot; La Manna in order to make a name for themselves.

Jackie&#x27;s star rose considerably in the intervening years, during which he started a family. He married Rosalie Aprile, and they had three children together. Jackie never wanted his son Jackie Aprile Jr. to get involved in the mob despite his success. He and Richie appointed Aprile crew associate Peter &quot;Beansie&quot; Gaeta to peddle heroin for them, taking the largest cut for themselves. Aprile was the acting boss of the family from 1995, when boss Ercole DiMeo went to prison, until 1999 when he dies of stomach cancer in the fourth episode of Season 1, and is succeeded by Junior.

====Mikey Palmice====
Michael &quot;Mikey&quot; Palmice is played by Al Sapienza. Mikey starts out as a soldier in Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano&#x27;s crew as his driver and bodyguard. After Jackie Aprile Sr. dies, Junior becomes boss. He is a very loyal, obsequious minion to Junior. In Tony&#x27;s brief and bloody war with Junior&#x27;s crew, following Junior&#x27;s attempt on Tony&#x27;s life, Paulie Gualtieri is assigned the hit on Mikey, along with Christopher Moltisanti. Chris&#x27; friend Brendan Filone had previously been killed by Mikey while in his bathtub on orders from Junior in retribution for Brendan stealing his merchandise. Tony decides to confront his uncle and Mikey by beating Mikey to the ground and stapling his jacket to his torso. He then goes to have a sit-down with Junior. Later, in retaliation for the attempted hit on Tony, Mikey is killed in the woods after Chris and Paulie chase him down while he is jogging.

In the episode &quot;From Where to Eternity&quot;, when Chris becomes clinically dead for a few minutes after his heart stops while in his comatose state, he has a morphine-induced dream in which he visits Hell and sees his deceased father &quot;Dickie&quot; Moltisanti along with his deceased friend Brendan Filone and Mikey Palmice. Chris informs Tony and Paulie that Mikey had a message for them: &quot;Three o&#x27;clock&quot;.

Paulie subsequently begins to have nightmares of being dragged to Hell and, at the recommendation of his mistress, he goes to see a medium in Nyack, New York. Much to Paulie&#x27;s chagrin, the authenticity of the medium is confirmed when he apparently begins communicating with people that Paulie has killed, with Mikey apparently giving details of his murder. Paulie remains unsettled and paranoid, as he feels he is being haunted by Palmice and others he had murdered throughout his criminal life.

====Agent Dwight Harris====
Agent Dwight Harris is played by Matt Servitto. Harris is an FBI Supervisor Agent-in-Charge specializing in the investigation of the DiMeo crime family with the FBI&#x27;s Newark Organized Crime Division Task Force. After September 11, Harris is reassigned to counter-terrorism duty with the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Pakistan. He approaches Christopher, and eventually Tony, for information on terrorism-related organized crime from his criminal connections at the Port of New York and New Jersey in exchange for banking &quot;goodwill&quot; in possible future RICO trials. In the Season 6 episode &quot;Kaisha&quot;, Harris appears at Satriale&#x27;s Pork Store to inform Tony that someone in his crew could be in danger, although he has no specific details. While investigating the murder of Gilbert Nieves at the Crazy Horse and Matush, with the possible terrorism links, he takes over the investigation from Long Branch, New Jersey police.

Later, Agent Harris and his partner, Agent Goddard, approach Tony at his home, requesting that Tony inform them should he come across any terror-related information in his line of work. Later, he suspects that two Muslim former patrons of the Bada Bing (Ahmed and Muhammad), who had been paying Christopher Moltisanti for stolen credit card numbers, were involved in terrorist activity. Tony provides their names and a cell phone number to Agent Harris, who is appreciative. In return, Agent Harris promises to write a letter detailing Tony&#x27;s assistance that will be placed in Tony&#x27;s FBI file for a judge to consider in sentencing should Tony ever be convicted of a crime.

Harris later tells Tony at Satriale&#x27;s that an informer among Phil Leotardo&#x27;s crew told them that Tony is being targeted by the Lupertazzi family. Agent Harris meets with Tony, and Tony offers him the name of the Muslim men&#x27;s bank. In return, Harris tells Tony that while in hiding, Leotardo has been making calls from a pay phone in Oyster Bay, Long Island, information he apparently obtains from a female agent from the Brooklyn FBI Organized Crime Division Office he has sexual relations with. When Agent Goddard later reports Leotardo&#x27;s murder, Harris exults in the success of his ploy, stating &quot;we&#x27;re gonna win this thing!&quot;

====Father Phil Intintola====
Father Phil Intintola is played by Paul Schulze and Michael Santoro (pilot episode only). Father Phil is the priest at the Sopranos&#x27; local Catholic church. Initially, Father Phil and Carmela Soprano have a robust friendship based on a mutual interest in romance films and Italian culture. Carmela&#x27;s husband, Tony, finds their friendship—and Father Phil&#x27;s constant, uninvited visits to their home for Carmela&#x27;s home-cooked food— irritating. Carmela describes Father Phil as a &quot;spiritual mentor&quot; she utilizes &quot;to become a better Catholic&quot;, and the rare male friend who appreciates things that the ultra-masculine Tony finds to be unmanly.

One rainy evening, with Tony and Meadow in Maine and AJ at a friend&#x27;s house, Father Phil visits a sick Carmela, and the two share ziti and wine together. After much wine and watching a film together, the two come very close to kissing. He sleeps over without having sex with Carmela, resulting in an awkward feeling between the two the morning after. Carmela gets jealous when she makes a surprise visit to the church to bring Father Phil home-cooked food—only to see him already being fed a home-cooked dish by her friend, Rosalie Aprile, and him having the same chemistry with Rosalie that she thought he only had with her. Soon after, Carmela confronts Father Phil and ends her friendship with him, accusing him of developing para-romantic relationships with women parishioners to gain gifts and other favors.

Although Father Phil was mostly seen ministering to female parishioners, he also counseled men. He repeatedly invited Tony to attend church and confession more often in order to reduce his anxiety attacks by improving his relationship with God. He counseled Artie Bucco when he was told about Tony burning down his restaurant by Livia. Father Phil encouraged Artie to go to the police and to tell Charmaine about the arson, which Artie ultimately didn&#x27;t do. He counseled Ralph Cifaretto when he came to him devastated and perplexed by his teen son&#x27;s life-threatening injury after an accident whilst playing bow and arrows with a friend. Father Phil encourages Ralph to view the tragedy as an opportunity to change his life&#x27;s course; he also gently rejects Ralph&#x27;s assertion that God allowed his son to be injured in order to punish Ralph for his criminal sins.

Later in the series, Carmela and Father Phil seem to be on good terms again until she confesses an act of adultery to him. He turns cold and is clearly disappointed, as he&#x27;d always urged Carmela to work on her marriage and had dissuaded her from considering divorce. He orders Carmela to do a penance by way of doing something nice for Tony, which she later does. In Season 6, when Tony is comatose after being shot, Carmela was again dependent upon Father Phil, who comforts her and the Soprano children at Tony&#x27;s hospital bedside.

====Vin Makazian====
Vin Makazian is played by John Heard. Vin was a Newark, New Jersey police detective who worked on narcotics and vice squads and fed information to Tony Soprano. He was raised by an abusive alcoholic father who beat him as a child and his mother. His salary was $40,000 per year and he had two failed marriages. Tony also used Vin as a personal private investigator, engaging Vin to find information about his psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi when Tony first started therapy in 1998.

One night he tailed her and pulled her car over under the ruse that the vehicle was seen leaving a crime scene earlier in the day. He then questioned Jennifer&#x27;s date, a lawyer, under the suspicion that he was driving drunk, and beats him unprovoked. Vin was responsible for informing Tony that Sal &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero was an FBI informant, prompting Tony&#x27;s suspicions of Pussy. This was later seemingly dismissed when Tony found out Vin owed Big Pussy $30,000 in Super Bowl XXXIII gambling debts with interest payments, and Vin would like to see Big Pussy taken out to absolve him of that debt.

The best man at one of Vin&#x27;s weddings sits on the New Jersey State Police Organized Crime Task Force and gave Vin the initial hint that Big Pussy was an informant. Vin frequented an illegal brothel and had a relationship with the madam there. He was arrested at the brothel along with Soprano crime family capo Raymond Curto during a police raid.

Vin later committed suicide, by leaping off the Donald and Morris Goodkind Bridges into the Raritan River shortly after he was released from jail and suspended from the police force. Tony later visited the madam Debra with whom Vin had a therapeutic relationship, and she divulges to Tony that Vin viewed him as a friend, and was prone to depression. This leaves Tony with guilt because he had always treated Vin with disdain and never showed him any respect or kindness.

====Dick Barone====
Dick Barone is played by Joe Lisi. Dick owned and operated Barone Sanitation, a container and trash removal service, and front business for the Soprano crew. The company handled their legitimate garbage hauling routes across New Jersey, including an illegal medical waste dumping site in Dayton, New Jersey, an asbestos removal project in Corning, New York, a weigh station in Dayton, New Jersey and a landfill in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. Dick is involved in price-fixing and bid rigging of waste hauling contracts in New Jersey and New York.

In a discussion with Richie Aprile and Tony, Tony says that all the garbage collection routes north of Paterson, New Jersey belong to Barone Sanitation while Larry Boy Barese and the D&#x27;Allessio brothers divide up the rest. Dick&#x27;s son Jason works as a ski instructor at Deer Valley in Summit County, Utah and knew little about the waste management business. In 1999, the lucrative new office parkway, the Triborough Towers in Essex County, New Jersey along the Eisenhower Parkway in Roseland, New Jersey and Livingston, New Jersey route was subject to a bidding war between Barone and Czechoslovakian-based waste management company, Kolar Brothers Sanitation. Dick Barone was part of the crews&#x27; discussions about the problem and was at Satriale&#x27;s when Christopher Moltisanti took it upon himself to deal with the issue and murder Emil Kolar. He also gets a route that was previously managed by Richie April in Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey when it comes up for bidding.

Chris&#x27; action led to the Kolar Bros. withdrawing their bid which Dick was happy to report to Tony. He worried about Richie Aprile due to Aprile&#x27;s and Junior Soprano&#x27;s front business, Zanone Bros, carting cocaine on his garbage association routes because he could lose his &quot;901&quot;, saying that he can handle the Department of Sanitation due to having a contact inside the Environmental Protection Agency, but not the Drug Enforcement Administration. Dick died in 2006 from Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. His funeral was attended by many members of the DiMeo crime family. Dick was survived by his wife, Helen Barone, and son, Jason.

Following his death, Barone Sanitation was bought out by Lupertazzi crime family firm, Cinelli Sanitation. Tony asked John Sacramoni for 25% of the sale price and a year&#x27;s salary until retirement plus a skim from the company which is $2,000 a week when the company went up for sale. He agreed to lower the sale settlement by staying on the payroll and lowering the skim profits.

====James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Altieri====
James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Altieri is played by Joe Badalucco. Jimmy was a capo in the DiMeo/Soprano crime family. In the episode &quot;Nobody Knows Anything&quot;, Jimmy was arrested for gun charges while running an illegal card game. The FBI found pool tables full of guns. Big Pussy Bonpensiero was also present and arrested but was already working for the feds at this point. Agent Skip Lipari stated he had been with them since 1998, although Tony thinks Pussy &quot;flipped&quot; in 1995.

Vin Makazian, Tony&#x27;s inside detective, who works clandestinely for Tony, informs Tony that Big Pussy Bonpensiero is &quot;wired for sound&quot; – that he is an informant. Tony finds this very difficult to believe. Shortly after Jimmy&#x27;s arrest, he is released. He shows up one night at Tony&#x27;s home during dinner. He and Tony walk into the basement where Jimmy begins asking Tony a lot of questions, making Tony very suspicious. Tony finds Jimmy&#x27;s behavior very peculiar and also believes he was released too promptly after his arrest.

Tony then begins to suspect that Makazian mistook Jimmy for Pussy as they are similar in appearance. Pussy abruptly disappears after being confronted by Paulie Gualtieri. Earlier in the episode, Vin Makazian, who had chronic depression, committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, so Tony was not able to confirm whether Vin had confused Jimmy and Pussy. Tony decides to go with his instincts and decides that Jimmy is an informant.

At a meeting with other administrators and capos, it is apparent to everyone else Jimmy is acting somewhat odd. As such, Uncle Junior sanctioned a hit on Jimmy and said he wanted a message to be sent. Christopher lured Jimmy to a hotel room using a stripper as bait. Once Jimmy was seated in the room, Silvio entered and put a gun to the back of his head. Jimmy realized what was about to happen and went for a gun in his ankle holster, at which point Silvio shot him in the back of his head. Jimmy&#x27;s body was found in an alley with a rat stuffed in his mouth. Carlo Gervasi subsequently takes over Jimmy&#x27;s abandoned crew after Jimmy&#x27;s death.

====Irina Peltsin====
Irina Peltsin is played by Oksana Lada. Irina is Tony&#x27;s 24-year-old Russian &quot;comàre&quot; during the first two seasons. Tony broke up with Irina in Season 2 because she wanted him to commit to a relationship. Irina then attempted suicide but was found by her cousin, Svetlana. As a sign of friendship, Tony sent Silvio to tell Irina to move on with her life and present her with a one-time payoff of $75,000. In Season 4, Assemblyman Ronald Zellman tells Tony that he has been dating Irina for quite some time, and Tony does not seem to care.

However, Tony later gets jealous and humiliates Zellman in front of Irina by whipping him with a belt. Svetlana later tells Tony the couple had broken up because, after the emasculating attack, Zellman &quot;could not perform.&quot; When Uncle Junior&#x27;s nurse Branca, who works for Svetlana, walks in on Tony and Svetlana just after they had sex, she later tells Irina. Irina calls Tony&#x27;s house and then tells Carmela that she is Tony&#x27;s ex-mistress and informs Carmela of Tony&#x27;s tryst with Svetlana. Carmela warns Irina never to call the house again, but the call prompts Carmela&#x27;s violent confrontation with Tony and their marital separation.

====Frank Cubitoso====
Frank Cubitoso is played by Frank Pellegrino. He is an FBI chief of Newark FBI Organized Crime Division Task Force with offices in 11 Center Place Newark, New Jersey who is constantly looking for new insight on the ongoing Soprano/DiMeo case. It was his idea to bug Green Grove Retirement Community when Tony Soprano, Jimmy Altieri, and Larry Boy Barese move their mothers in, despite other agents&#x27; skepticism. He successfully coordinates a mission to put the Soprano residence under surveillance though the use of an old lamp in their basement. The operation ends when Meadow takes the old lamp to college. He later pressures Adriana La Cerva into wearing a wire, which leads to her confession and eventual death. When Agent Sanseverino worries after Adriana disappears, Cubitoso decides it is time to move on.

====Elliot Kupferberg====
Elliot Kupferberg is played by Peter Bogdanovich. Elliot is the therapist of Jennifer Melfi, who is the psychiatrist of Tony Soprano. Elliot tries to convince her numerous times to refer Tony to another colleague. Elliot calls her &quot;Jen&quot; during their sessions. Vin Makazian, Tony&#x27;s inside cop, reveals to Tony when he is asked to survey Jennifer that she sees her own psychiatrist, Kupferberg, which surprises Tony. Elliot has a daughter, Saskia. Saskia, a butch lesbian, was an upperclassman at Columbia University when Tony&#x27;s daughter, Meadow Soprano, was a freshman and gave a presentation that led Meadow to join the South Bronx legal clinic that eventually put Meadow on the path to law school.

Elliot once unknowingly encountered Tony in the parking garage at Columbia University, while both were visiting their daughters. He followed Tony in his car in the hopes of taking Tony&#x27;s parking space when he left but annoyed Tony by driving too closely. In the episode &quot;Employee of the Month&quot;, Elliot urges her to cease treating her gangster patient, whose name she inadvertently reveals to Elliot. In 2007, following Tony&#x27;s shooting by Junior and the rise of his media profile, Melfi accuses Elliot of directing their therapy towards discussing &quot;Patient Soprano&quot; because of his desire for gossip and continuous shows of interest in the Mafia.

In the episode &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, he tells Melfi of a study that concludes that talk therapy enables sociopaths. In the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, he further presses Melfi about Soprano at a dinner party, where he reveals to guests that Soprano is Melfi&#x27;s patient, to her embarrassment, a serious breach of doctor-patient confidentiality, although he dismisses her protests casually, saying everyone at the table is a professional. However, she later reads the study at home and is convinced of its findings. At her next session with Tony, she permanently ends further sessions.

Elliot frequently drinks from a very large reusable water bottle during therapy sessions, which Bogdanovich claims was his own bottle at the time.

====Hugh DeAngelis====
Hugo &quot;Hugh&quot; DeAngelis is played by Tom Aldredge. Hugh is Carmela&#x27;s father who is in his mid-70s. Hugh has been married to Mary for over 40 years and is a resident of West Orange, New Jersey. He is a former sailor of the United States Navy and spent time in Halifax, Nova Scotia at CFB Halifax during the war. Although he is semi-retired, Hugh had worked as a contractor, and he built Tony and Carmela&#x27;s house. Hugh has a brother named Lester and a sister named Lena, who is the mother of Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s father Dickie, thus making Hugh Chris&#x27;s great uncle.

During Carmela and Tony&#x27;s separation, Hugh was eager to see Tony whenever possible and often took Tony&#x27;s side in family discussions. He did not want to be present at a family gathering if &quot;the man of the house&quot; was not there, in the episode &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. Hugh became involved in a real estate investment with Carmela involving a spec house. However, construction of the spec house was halted after a building inspector found that low-quality wood had been used. Carmela blamed her father for the setback and Hugh became angry that Carmela was treating him as a subordinate rather than a partner. Carmela and Hugh reconciled enough for him to attend Christmas celebrations at the Soprano home later that year – after Carmela&#x27;s spec house started to go ahead again.

====Mary DeAngelis====
Mary DeAngelis (née Pellegrino) is played by Suzanne Shepherd. Mary is Carmela&#x27;s mother who is in her mid-70s. Mary has been married to her husband Hugh DeAngelis for over 40 years. Shortly after Carmela began dating Tony Soprano, she became extremely protective of her daughter and tried to prevent her from marrying him. After Carmela got married, the De Angelises met Tony&#x27;s mother, Livia Soprano, with whom they became very angry after Livia told Carmela that &quot;Tony would get bored of her.&quot; Mary also has psoriasis. Carmela believes Mary is a &quot;self-hating Italian&quot; on account of her distaste for certain Italian-American stereotypes.

====Agent Skip Lipari====
Agent Skip Lipari is played by Louis Lombardi. Skip is an FBI agent who handled Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero. When Sal begins to confide more and more to Skip as a friend, Skip tries to tell him that he is not his friend and he is there to help the federal government. Pussy tells Skip that he lost all respect in Tony when Tony sent him out to look for AJ&#x27;s science teacher Mr. Miller&#x27;s Saturn that had been stolen. During a meeting at a party store, Sal coincidentally is seen by mob associate Jimmy Bones and introduces Skip as &quot;Joe from Dover, Delaware&quot; without much success in holding up the story.

This later leads to Sal murdering Jimmy to cover up his connection with the FBI. Sal tries to trap Christopher in a RICO predicate with Tony by offering to get his girlfriend a BMW M3 convertible and give the information to the FBI. Sal fails to follow Moltisanti to a hijacking job when he hits a bicyclist. In the Season 2 finale, Sal is murdered by Tony, Paulie, and Silvio after they discover he is an informant.

====Matthew Bevilaqua====
Matthew Bevilaqua is played by Lillo Brancato Jr. Matthew was Sean Gismonte&#x27;s partner-in-crime from West Orange, New Jersey and an associate working under Christopher Moltisanti in the Gualtieri crew. Born in 1977, he was 23 years old when he was killed, in &quot;From Where to Eternity.&quot; In &quot;Mr. Ruggiero&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot;, Bonpensiero is overheard on an FBI wiretap that Bevilaqua&#x27;s family is involved in the construction business and that the family saw him as a . Matthew also mentions that he, Sean and Bear Iyer attended the Lubin School of Business at Pace University and are licensed stock brokers and Webistics jobbers. He bought marijuana from a drug dealer at The Bada Bing.

Matt worked with Christopher in various aspects of organized crime, including the Massarone construction site, a pump and dump stockbroking scheme at an over-the-counter brokerage house in Bayonne, New Jersey involving an internet company called Webistics, assisting with Junior Soprano&#x27;s executive card game, and some burglary jobs with Chris and Sean. When Chris leaves work early to go to the Jersey Shore with Adrianna, he leaves Matt in charge of the brokerage. They stole a Porsche Carrera from the office building where they were running the pump and dump stock scam and beat up a stockbroker for suggesting a different stock.

Matt threatened to stab the office manager of the brokerage in the throat with a letter opener if he told Chris Moltisanti about their actions. The office manager reported them anyway. Silvio referred to Matt and Sean as, &quot;Chip n&#x27; Dale&quot; after the cartoon because of their ineptness. Matt tells Christopher that he sees no point in getting married because he can get all the women he wants and always hire someone to wash his dishes and iron his shirts. He drives a Buick Park Avenue that he abandons after Sean is shot and killed in the passenger seat during the failed mob hit on Christopher Moltisanti.

Despite their general lack of talent, the duo desperately wanted to move up in the ranks of the family. They tried to impress Tony whenever possible but eventually angered him by attempting to directly discuss criminal activity with him at the toilets in a men&#x27;s room, unaware of the threat of wiretapping. Then, hoping to gain favor with Richie Aprile, Matt and Sean decided to make an assassination attempt on Christopher, who they knew Aprile disliked. Attempting a drive-by ambush in the parking lot outside the Skyway Diner in Kearny, they hit Christopher twice but were unable to kill him. Before collapsing from blood loss, Christopher was able to return fire, killing Sean.

Matthew fled to seek protection from Richie Aprile, who reacted angrily and chased him away by throwing a baseball bat at him. When Tony Soprano and Big Pussy Bonpensiero found him hiding in Hacklebarney State Park, they interrogated him before they emptied their guns into him in one of the park&#x27;s concession stands. Before he is killed, Bevilaqua pleads to Tony that it was all Sean&#x27;s idea to shoot Moltisanti. There was a witness in the park who connected the murder to Tony, although the witness retracted his statement upon learning that one of the shooters might have been Tony Soprano. The newspaper identified Matthew as a Soprano crime family &quot;associate.&quot;

====Jackie Aprile Jr.====
Giacomo Michael &quot;Jackie&quot; Aprile Jr. is played by Jason Cerbone. Jackie Jr. was born into a North Jersey mafia family in 1978 and raised in Lincoln Park, New Jersey. His father, Jackie Aprile Sr., was once the acting boss of the DiMeo crime family, and his uncle Richie Aprile was a longtime DiMeo capo. Jackie Jr. was a linebacker for his football team at Boonton High School and was selected for All-State. Despite attending Rutgers University, Jackie Jr. drifted towards a life of crime after his father&#x27;s death, and he began helping his uncle Richie when Richie was released from prison.

Jackie&#x27;s mother Rosalie Aprile began a romantic relationship with Ralph Cifaretto, who became a mentor in Jackie&#x27;s attempt to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps. Tony had been a close friend of Jackie Sr. and had promised to keep Jackie Jr. away from organized crime. Ralph&#x27;s bad influence, Jackie Jr.&#x27;s own faults, and Tony&#x27;s insistence that Jackie Jr. not become involved propelled Jackie Jr. into a brief, humiliating and fatal criminal career.

Jackie and his Rutgers fraternity brother Dino Zerilli began selling ecstasy to college kids. Jackie later planned the robbery of a Jewel-Amnesty International benefit concert at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers and drove the getaway car for Christopher Moltisanti and Benny Fazio. While waiting in the car, Jackie urinated on himself.

Jackie dated Tony&#x27;s daughter, Meadow and tried to maintain the appearance of a respectable college student while drifting further into the Mafia life. Tony began to see through Jackie&#x27;s facade when he caught him at the casino on Bloomfield Ave in Bloomfield, New Jersey and then later at a strip club. Ralph gave Jackie Jr. a .38 revolver, which infuriated Tony, who beat Jackie up in the bathroom of the club after catching him getting a lap dance.

Jackie failed out of Rutgers University after he was caught cheating during an exam. Meadow suggested that he enroll at the Fashion Institute of Technology because he said he has a passion for designing men&#x27;s suits. Meadow later broke up with Jackie after she found him cheating on her. Resentful of Tony&#x27;s hypocrisy, Jackie began working directly for Ralph, forming his own minor crew in the process.

Upon hearing Ralph tell the story of when Jackie&#x27;s father and Tony robbed a card game held by Feech La Manna, Jackie was inspired to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps. Using his dim-witted crew of Carlo Renzi, Dino Zerilli and Matush, Jackie attempted to hold up a card game run by Soprano soldier Eugene Pontecorvo. In the robbery, Jackie killed &quot;Sunshine&quot; the dealer and made man Furio Giunta was shot in the leg. Christopher killed Carlo and after hearing gunshots, Matush fled in the getaway car. Jackie escaped by jacking a car and sped past Dino, who was killed by Christopher and Albert Barese.

In &quot;Army of One,&quot; Jackie was hiding in a Boonton housing project when he called Tony to claim he attempted the robbery in imitation of Tony and Jackie Sr. Ralph implies that Jackie should be given a pass for the failed robbery. However, Tony implies that the near-unconditional protection given to &quot;made men&quot; should take priority, which leads Ralph to give the order to have Jackie killed. Jackie Jr. was walking through the Boonton projects when Vito Spatafore shot him in the back of the head. Rosalie, Meadow and the rest of the family were told that Jackie was killed by black drug dealers during a botched transaction.

====Gloria Trillo====
Gloria Trillo is played by Annabella Sciorra. Gloria is a car saleswoman for Globe Motors, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Fairfield, New Jersey. Like Tony, she is a patient of Jennifer Melfi&#x27;s. She meets Tony at Melfi&#x27;s office due to a scheduling mix-up. There is an immediate attraction between the two and within days they are having an affair. She tells Tony that she has &quot;murdered&quot; seven relationships to date. Although she presents the facade of a strong and independent woman, Gloria is mentally unstable and exhibits signs of borderline personality disorder, which leads to occasional violent arguments and physical altercations with Tony, bouts of severe depression, and frequent suicidal thoughts.

She nearly drives Tony to kill her at one point before he stops himself and leaves her house. One such incident occurs after Gloria sees Tony&#x27;s wife Carmela at her dealership, getting her car serviced, and offers to drive her home. Tony calls it quits and cuts off all contact with her and orders Patsy Parisi to threaten Gloria into staying away from him. Patsy accomplishes this by posing as a customer at the dealership and going on a test drive with Gloria.

When they are out of the city, Patsy pulls out a gun and tells a horrified Gloria to shut up and listen to him: if she ever contacts Tony or his family again, he will murder her, and &quot;it will not be cinematic&quot;, destroying her delusion that she will ever die at Tony&#x27;s hands. This unbalance eventually leads Gloria to suicide, and she hangs herself in her home a year later. Tony later goes back to Globe Motors and inquires after her to another salesman, who confirms her death. Tony later initially blames Melfi for Gloria&#x27;s death, claiming that she did too little to save Gloria, before blaming himself.

====Carmine Lupertazzi Sr.====
Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. is played by Tony Lip. Carmine was an old-school boss of the Lupertazzi crime family. He kept a low profile for most of his criminal career while operating out of his social clubs and restaurants in New York City. He lives in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. Carmine was arrested and acquitted of labor racketeering charges in the 1980s. It was around this time that Carmine&#x27;s longtime consigliere, Angelo Garepe and longtime Lupertazzi family captain Phil Leotardo, were convicted of various racketeering charges and sent to prison, Angelo for 18 years and Phil for 20 years. During Carmine&#x27;s tenure, his family was the largest and wealthiest of the Five Families in New York City. They maintained close ties to New Jersey&#x27;s DiMeo crime family.

Carmine groomed his son and namesake Little Carmine Lupertazzi, by making him a captain in the crime family that bears his name. He had a sometimes contentious relationship with his underboss Johnny Sack. During various episodes in the fourth season, Johnny and Carmine each authorized Tony Soprano to put a &quot;hit&quot; on the other, although they were both called off at the last minute. In 2004, Carmine&#x27;s health began to fail and he suffered a massive stroke while having lunch with Tony, Johnny, and Angelo Garepe at a country club, and soon after died in hospital. This left a large power vacuum in the Lupertazzi family.

The heir apparent for his position was his son Little Carmine, a fact that became a point of consternation for Johnny Sack. Johnny did not think much of Little Carmine and felt as Carmine&#x27;s underboss, he was next in line to be boss. Even Tony has no faith in Little Carmine&#x27;s capacity to run New York, jokingly referring to him as &quot;Brainless the Second&quot;. Despite his shortcomings, Little Carmine finds backers in Carmine Sr.&#x27;s recently paroled former consigliere, Angelo Garepe, and long-time Lupertazzi Capo Rusty Millio.

Angelo and Rusty, along with Rusty&#x27;s right-hand man Eddie Pietro, pull most of the strings during the war between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine. After a cycle of bloodshed that escalates into war, Little Carmine ultimately finds it difficult to stomach the continuing violence and abdicates. His decision was heavily influenced by the murder of Angelo Garepe. After Little Carmine&#x27;s capitulation, Johnny Sack becomes the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family.

====Rusty Millio====
Rusty Millio is played by Frankie Valli. He is a respected and powerful veteran capo in the Lupertazzi Family. Rusty serves as a mentor and advisor to Little Carmine and considered to be one of the instigators in Little Carmine&#x27;s power struggle with Johnny Sack following the death of his father and boss, Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. Johnny Sack displays contempt for Rusty, whom he calls the &quot;Mayor of Munchkinland&quot; due to his 5 ft 5 in height.

Rusty and Angelo Garape attempt to recruit Tony Blundetto into killing Joseph &quot;Joey Peeps&quot; Peperelli, a loyalist of Johnny Sack. Blundetto is initially hesitant but eventually carries out the hit, resulting in a cycle of revenge-killings that culminates in the murder of Billy Leotardo. While in prison, Johnny Sack orders through Tony Soprano a hit on Rusty because he anticipates Rusty is likely to try to wrest power away from him. In the episode &quot;Luxury Lounge&quot;, Rusty and his driver Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Pietro are killed in Rusty&#x27;s driveway by the Italian hitmen Tony contracted.

====Michele &quot;Feech&quot; La Manna====
Michele &quot;Feech&quot; La Manna is played by Robert Loggia. Feech is a Mustache Pete who was &quot;made&quot; in Southern Italy. Feech moved to the US in the 1950s and settled in Hamilton Park, Jersey City. He became involved with the DiMeo crime family in bookmaking and loansharking, then under the leadership of boss Ercole &quot;Eckley&quot; DiMeo. He also operates a bakery that makes taralli, a pastry from the region.

A young Jackie Aprile Sr. and Tony Soprano robbed his floating high-stakes card game, thereby solidifying their status as rising mobsters in the organization. Despite Feech&#x27;s anger at having been robbed, Jackie&#x27;s older brother, Richie Aprile, then a high-ranking earner and soldier in the family, intervened on Tony and Jackie&#x27;s behalf and got them both a pass. Silvio Dante reveals they were also helped because both Johnny Soprano and Junior Soprano were powerful capos under DiMeo.

When he was released and introduced in Season 5, Feech went to see Tony Soprano, the new boss of North Jersey, where he was given permission to get back in the action. After a power struggle with Paulie Walnuts over landscaping territory, Feech stole cars from the valet at Ira Fried&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s wedding in Ringwood, New Jersey, and sold them to a dealer in Newburgh, New York. Tony had previously made it clear that Fried was a friend and was not to be touched, but Feech went ahead with his plan anyway.

Tony realized that Feech still thought of him as a youngster and saw Junior as the boss, paying his respects and going to Junior about complaints instead of Tony. As a result, Tony instructed Christopher Moltisanti and Benny Fazio to convince Feech to keep a truck of stolen plasma screen televisions in his garage. When a parole officer suddenly appears at his home and discovers the televisions, Feech was arrested, and sent back to prison.

==Minor characters==
===Soprano crime family===

*Ercole &quot;Eckley&quot; DiMeo: a.k.a. &quot;Old Man&quot;, is the founder and the longtime boss of the DiMeo crime family. He is an unseen character in the series but is portrayed by the series creator David Chase in &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;, in an uncredited cameo appearance. By the events of Season 1, he is boss in name only and never demonstrates any influence over the family due to being incarcerated since 1995, held at United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri.

*Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Moltisanti: Former soldier in the Soprano crew who lived in Paramus, New Jersey next to the Westfield Garden State Plaza, &quot;the largest mall in New Jersey&quot; with his family. He is an unseen character in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Born before 1959 (when Tony was born) and died in the mid-1970s, married to Joanne Moltisanti née Blundetto, father of Christopher and cousin to Carmela Soprano. Hugh DeAngelis, Carmela&#x27;s father, has a sister Lena who is Dickie&#x27;s mother, thus making Hugh DeAngelis a great uncle to Christopher Moltisanti. Dickie was in the U.S. Navy (as was Hugh) stationed at Naval Weapons Station Earle and saw action in the naval battles of the Vietnam War and later served time in prison, making it unlikely that he spent much time with his family when he was alive. It is suggested from his Navy photograph that he was in the Fleet Marine Force. Dickie was killed during Christopher&#x27;s infancy, outside the house while bringing TV trays home. In 2002, Tony Soprano told Christopher that Dickie&#x27;s killer was Clifton, New Jersey Detective Lt. Barry Haydu, who had just retired from the force. Tony delivered Haydu to Christopher Moltisanti as a part of his process of bonding Chris to him and slowly easing him up the family hierarchy. When confronted by Christopher, Haydu initially denies having heard of Dickie Moltisanti. Moltisanti is played by Alessandro Nivola in the 2021 film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;. In the film, Moltisanti and his crew fight with black criminal Harold McBrayer. In the early 1970s, Moltisanti is shot in the back of the head by an unknown assailant, under the orders of Junior Soprano after Moltisanti had laughed at Junior when he slipped and fell on the steps at a wake, angering him.

*Joseph Siravo (&quot;The Sopranos&quot;), Jon Bernthal (&quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;) as Giovanni &quot;Johnny Boy&quot; Soprano: he is Tony Soprano&#x27;s deceased father, the former captain of the Soprano crew. He was the son of Corrado Soprano Sr. and Mariangela D&#x27;Agostino from Ariano in the Province of Avellino who immigrated to the United States in 1911; he was a master stonemason who helped to build a church in Newark, New Jersey. Johnny was married to Livia Pollio and they had three children: Janice, Tony, and Barbara. Johnny worked closely with his older brother Corrado (&quot;Junior&quot;) during Tony&#x27;s childhood. Johnny was sent away to prison, for a short while when Tony was young, and the family members said Johnny Boy was in Montana working as a cowboy. Johnny and Junior both went on to become capos in the DiMeo crime family. Johnny was well-liked in the organization – before his death, boss Ercoli &quot;Eckley&quot; DiMeo was thought to have been considering having Johnny take over. Sal &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero and Paulie Gualtieri were both in Johnny&#x27;s crew. Bonpensiero stood up for Johnny in the unrest of &#x27;83, and Johnny&#x27;s leadership led to Sal&#x27;s becoming a made man shortly afterward. Both Sal and Paulie followed Johnny&#x27;s wishes and supported Tony&#x27;s becoming capo after Johnny&#x27;s death of emphysema. Johnny took Tony and his friend Silvio Dante under his wing and brought them up in the organization as part of his crew. Johnny was only seen in flashbacks to Tony&#x27;s childhood or in Tony&#x27;s dream sequences. In 1969, Tony witnessed Johnny cut off Francis Satriale&#x27;s pinky finger while Junior held him in place; Satriale owed gambling debts and was avoiding giving Johnny payment. This event contributed to Tony&#x27;s first panic attack at the kitchen table that evening. Tony also saw his father and Junior attack Rocco Alatore over a debt, then recalled his father&#x27;s discussing a possible move to Reno, Nevada in 1967 to manage a supper club for Alatore (who was restored to good terms with Johnny since the debt was repaid) and his mother&#x27;s refusing, which move Livia would later sweep under the rug when Mr. Alatore later became a billionaire with his investments. It is revealed in the episode &quot;A Hit Is a Hit&quot; that Johnny was a silent partner in Hesh Rabkin&#x27;s record company &quot;F-Note Records&quot;. Tony also witnessed Johnny plotting a scheme in 1967 at a children&#x27;s carnival by bringing Janice along. Tony had originally thought his father favored Janice over him but later learned the truth: that mobsters brought their daughters to their meetings as a ruse. When Janice recalled the time Johnny shot through Livia&#x27;s beehive hairdo while they were driving home, Tony thought the anecdote was shameful and made their family look &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. Tony described his mother&#x27;s relationship with his father as wearing Johnny down to &quot;a little nub&quot;; for her part, Livia tearfully remembers Johnny as &quot;a saint&quot; several times. Johnny kept a mistress named Fran Felstein, whom he had met during Tony&#x27;s childhood. In 1976, when Tony was 16, Johnny stayed all night at her home when his pregnant wife was in the hospital. The next morning Johnny and Tony went to the hospital, and Tony lied to his mother saying they went to a New York Yankees baseball game and stayed in New York. Livia saw through Johnny&#x27;s lie and lost the baby due to bleeding. In September 1982, when his son Tony was 22 years old, and just two weeks before the birth of his granddaughter Meadow, Johnny ordered his son to murder a local bookie: Willie Overall. This was Tony&#x27;s first murder, and it helped hasten his climb toward becoming a made man. Johnny died of emphysema in late 1986, aged 62. Not long before his death, he saw the incarceration of many of his fellow mobsters due to Fabian &quot;Febby&quot; Petrulio&#x27;s becoming a government witness. Johnny never recovered from the news of Febby&#x27;s betrayal, and it may have hastened his demise.

*Ercole &quot;Eckley&quot; Soprano was an unseen character. Ercole was Tony Soprano&#x27;s late uncle, the middle son of Corrado Sr. and Mariangela D&#x27;Agostino, and brother of Junior and Johnny. He was born between 1924 and 1928 in East Orange, New Jersey. Tony never met him and finds out about his existence from Junior in &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;. Junior Soprano tells Tony that he and Johnny Soprano started the high-stakes $5,000-buy in &quot;executive&quot; Five-card stud poker card game over 30 years before 1999 to help financially support Ercole that brought in big-time players like David Lee Roth and Frank Sinatra Jr. Ercole had an intellectual disability and developmental disability and was institutionalized in a state-run assisted living institution early in his life by his mother and his existence concealed because of the stigma of having a mentally handicapped child at the time. In &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; while Junior is trying to feign mental incompetence during his RICO trial he remembers how people in the neighborhood used to mock and make fun of Ercole. He was &quot;strong as a bull&quot; and looked like George Raft. In the episode house arrest after Livia finds out about Tony seeing a psychiatrist, she mentions to Junior that Tony might be on his way to be institutionalized at Essex County Hospital Center &quot;(Cedar Grove Mental Hospital)&quot; in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. Junior explains that society did not understand these things back then and nowadays they would have enrolled him in a trade school, but praises his mother for making sure Ercole was taken care of at a home in North Jersey. Junior also boasts to Tony that Johnny paid for his care with their criminal proceeds. Tony recalls listening to Johnny Boy and Livia argue and she would mention a &quot;feeble-minded brother&quot; who at that time Tony always assumed she was referring to Junior Soprano. He reportedly died around 1985, shortly before Johnny&#x27;s demise.

*George Loros as Raymond &quot;Buffalo Ray&quot; Curto: he was a capo in the DiMeo crime family. A capo in the DiMeo/Soprano crime family before Season 1, Curto is approached by fellow capo Tony Soprano and asked to replace Jackie Aprile Sr. as boss of the DiMeo Crime Family, due to his age and experience, as Jackie is dying of cancer in the hospital. Curto declines, and insists, along with the other capos, that Tony should take over instead, fearing Tony&#x27;s uncle and fellow capo Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano would step up as the new boss. However, Curto is also an FBI informant, as revealed in the episode, &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot;. It has never been disclosed when or why he became an informant, although he is briefly seen in the episode &quot;Nobody Knows Anything&quot; being busted at a brothel along with Detective Vin Makazian. In 2006, Curto unexpectedly dies of a stroke in his FBI handler&#x27;s car. Curto was handled by both Agent Robyn Sanseverino and Agent Frank Grasso.

*Anthony DeSando as Brendan Filone: he was Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s friend and partner in crime and a low-level associate of Tony Soprano. Brendan was addicted to crystal meth, and often used it with Chris. In the episode &quot;46 Long&quot;, Brendan and Chris hijacked a Harrison, New Jersey Comley Trucking truck and stole a number of DVD players. Comley Trucking was under the protection of Junior Soprano, who demanded restitution. At a sit-down, Junior tells Tony to keep Brendan and Christopher&#x27;s &quot;loose cannon&quot; behavior under control. In a nightclub, Brendan tries his best to convince Chris to defy Tony and Uncle Junior since both Chris and Brendan were getting nowhere by following the rules. Early the next morning, Brendan urges Chris to get ready for the next heist, a truckload of high-end Italian suits. Christopher tells him that he has decided that he would not participate. Brendan, this time without Christopher, hijacks another Comley truck with two others. In the process, the driver of the truck is accidentally shot and killed by a ricochet bullet when one of Brendan&#x27;s men drops his gun. Tony is angry when he learns about the hijacking and orders Chris and Brendan to return the truck to Comley. However, Junior is not satisfied. Junior&#x27;s trigger man Mikey Palmice and sister-in-law Livia Soprano, both give Junior advice on the matter. Junior orders that Chris undergo a mock execution and that Brendan be killed. Brendan is killed while in his bathtub by Mikey, while Junior waits outside in the hall. In the aftermath, Chris and his girlfriend Adriana La Cerva find Brendan&#x27;s body in his bathtub, and Chris calls for harsh retaliation against Mikey. Tony decides to confront his uncle and Mikey over their severe punishment by beating Mikey to the ground and stapling his jacket to his torso. He then goes to have a sit-down with Junior for his orders. Later, in retaliation for the attempted hit on Tony, Mikey is killed in the woods after Chris and Paulie Gualtieri chase him down while he is jogging. In Season 2, after Chris is shot by Sean Gismonte and Matthew Bevilaqua, he has a near-death experience in the hospital where he goes to say he went to Hell and explains that he saw Brendan and Mikey playing cards with a bunch of Roman soldiers and Irishmen. Chris also mentions that Brendan and Mikey are friends in Hell. Hearing this, Paulie becomes obsessed with his own fears of ghosts.

*Tony Darrow as Lorenzo &quot;Larry Boy&quot; Barese: he is the caporegime of his own crew which is the biggest in the DiMeo crime family. Larry&#x27;s cousin, Albert &quot;Ally Boy&quot; Barese, is his second-in-command. Larry is also the godfather of Soprano associate Benny Fazio. In the Season 1 episode &quot;Pax Soprana&quot;, Larry, along with Jimmy Altieri and Raymond Curto, met with Tony after Junior had Mikey Palmice murder Larry&#x27;s top earner, Rusty Irish, for selling ecstasy to the grandson of one of Junior&#x27;s friends; the grandson committed suicide while high. Larry and the other capos considered this to be a sign of Junior abusing his power as boss. Larry found out from an FBI secretary that an indictment was going to be issued against the crime family in the New Jersey Superior Court. Soon after, along with Junior and underboss Joseph &quot;Beppy&quot; Sasso, he was arrested and charged with violations of racketeering and fraud and sent to Green Haven Correctional Facility in Beekman, New York. While being held without bail in prison, Larry promoted his cousin Albert Barese to acting caporegime of his crew. Three years after the indictments, Larry was released following a mistrial and put under house arrest. However, he took control of his crew back from his cousin. At the premiere of the fictional slasher film &quot;Cleaver&quot; that Christopher Moltisanti had produced, Larry was arrested by federal marshals for violating his house arrest. It is strongly suggested that Larry was working with the FBI by the end of the series, which ends with him in jail awaiting a retrial.

*Val Bisoglio as Murf Lupo: Elderly soldier and former capo of Junior Soprano&#x27;s old crew, who is starting to mumble and show signs of Dysarthria when talking and is starting to show the early signs of dementia that worries Junior. Junior also notices that he is starting to look unkempt, with food on the front of his shirt when he goes out and he goes to bed early.

*Dan Grimaldi as Phillip &quot;Philly Spoons&quot; Parisi: Phillip is a soldier/acting capo of Junior&#x27;s crew and Patsy Parisi&#x27;s identical twin brother, born March 4, 1950, eleven minutes after Patsy in Bloomfield, New Jersey. He was killed on Tony&#x27;s orders by Gigi Cestone in retaliation for spreading rumors about Tony, shortly after the conflict between him and Junior. In a deleted scene from Season 2, it is revealed that Philly Parisi is both Junior&#x27;s godson and Tony&#x27;s maternal cousin.

*Louis Gross as Perry Annunziata: also known as &quot;Muscles Marinara,&quot; is from Bloomfield, New Jersey He serves as a bodyguard and chauffeur for Tony Soprano during his recovery from a gunshot in 2006. Tony calls him &quot;Penne Arrabiata&quot; (as in the pasta dish penne all&#x27;arrabbiata), on account of his road rage (Italian: &quot;arrabbiato&quot;) towards a rude driver while driving Tony.

*Vitali Baganov as Valery: Valery was a &quot;Bratok&quot; in the Russian mob, acquainted with Tony Soprano through his business association with the organization. Valery&#x27;s friend and boss Slava Malevsky revealed to Tony that they served together in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation where he worked with the Russian Airborne Troops during the First Chechen War in Chechnya. Valery had personally killed 16 Chechen Republic of Ichkeria rebels, saving Slava&#x27;s life in the process. In &quot;Pine Barrens&quot;, Paulie Walnuts and Christopher Moltisanti visited Valery at his apartment to collect payment. Valery readily handed over the envelope of money, but Paulie responded to a perceived slight by being intentionally careless with Valery&#x27;s entertainment system. In the ensuing brawl, Christopher and Paulie believed they had killed Valery. They drove out to the Pine Barrens to dispose of him, but when they arrive, find him alive. They marched him into the snow to dig his own grave, but he attacked Paulie and Christopher with the shovel and ran. Christopher and Paulie gave chase, firing as they ran. Paulie seemingly hit Valery in the head, leaving a trail of blood. The two men continued looking for him but eventually gave up, and realized they were lost in the wilderness in the middle of winter. Chris and Paulie then spent a miserable night in an abandoned van in the Pine Barrens. On rescuing the pair, Tony made it clear that if Valery makes it back to North Jersey alive, it would be Paulie who would have to deal with Slava, not him. Valery&#x27;s fate after this point is unclear; Valery&#x27;s body was never found, and Paulie&#x27;s car was stolen from the remote location where it was parked in the wilderness. An HBO promo shows notable characters who have been murdered over the course of the series and does show Valery as having died in this episode, but with a question mark, indicating some doubt. David Chase said in an interview at the Writers&#x27; Guild:

*Maria Grazia Cucinotta as Isabella: Appears in &quot;Isabella&quot; as a figment of Tony Soprano&#x27;s imagination. Soprano sees a beautiful Italian woman in the Cusamanos&#x27; garden next door. Isabella tells him she is a foreign exchange dental student from Avellino, staying there while the Cusamanos are away. He takes her out to lunch. As she describes the beauty of Avellino, where Tony&#x27;s grandfather came from, he has a drug-induced daydream from the Lithium (medication). Isabella is in a village house, in a rocking chair, nursing a baby named Antonio. Then Isabella is no longer there. When the Cusamanos return and he asks about her, Tony realizes she never existed: it was a delusion. Dr. Melfi instructs him to cease taking lithium and theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure.

*Sofia Milos as Annalisa Zucca: Daughter of Zi Vittorio, head of a Neapolitan Camorra family in Italy. She is also married to the acting Camorra boss, Mauro Zucca, who is currently serving a life sentence, and a distant cousin of Tony Soprano. When Tony took over Junior&#x27;s luxury car hijacking business, he went to visit &quot;Zi&quot; (Uncle) Vittorio in Naples to discuss the parameters of their arrangement. When he finally meets Zi Vittorio, Tony finds out that he is a senile, wheelchair-bound old man, and that it is Annalisa who runs the organization now. Tony finds this hard to accept at first, but eventually works out a deal with Annalisa—he would cut the price of the cars he supplies to Naples, in exchange for her to supply him with members of her organization. This resulted in Furio Giunta being sent to the United States, and later, in Season 6, Tony being supplied with the hitmen to take care of the hit on Rusty Millio, and Philip &quot;Phil&quot; Leotardo.

*Chris Tardio as Sean Gismonte, an associate of the DiMeo crime family from West Orange, New Jersey in Essex County, New Jersey. He was Matthew Bevilaqua&#x27;s partner in crime and an associate in the Gualtieri crew in 2000. He was born and raised in Hoboken, New Jersey. Sean was convicted of an undisclosed crime and had spent time in county jail and it is implied that, unlike Matt, Sean has worked pump and dump stock broker scheme before. It is suggested that he attended Lubin School of Business at Pace University with Matt but wanted to pursue a life in crime, considering themselves more intelligent but underappreciated considering their skill set by Chris. Sean and Matt worked with Christopher at various aspects of organized crime including the Massarone Construction site, an over-the-counter brokerage house in Bayonne, New Jersey that was responsible for a Pump and Dump on the website Webistics, Junior Soprano&#x27;s executive card game held in a hotel by Newark Liberty International Airport and some burglary jobs with Matthew and Chris. He was reprimanded for beating a stockbroker and stealing a Porsche Carrera from the parking lot of where the stock brokerage is. Looking to move up in the ranks, Sean and Matt attempted a hit on Christopher as an attempt to win favor from Richie Aprile. The hit was botched and Sean was killed by Christopher in the ensuing gun battle.

*Frank Albanese as Patrizio &quot;Uncle Pat&quot; Blundetto: a former soldier in the Soprano crew who worked alongside Johnny Boy Soprano. Chris compares his ruthlessness to Jake LaMotta. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was able to retire from &quot;the business&quot;. Pat is the uncle of Tony Blundetto and Chris Moltisanti, and the father of Louise Blundetto. Tony Soprano calls him Uncle Pat but they are not blood relatives. Pat&#x27;s brother Al Blundetto married Quintina Pollio, Livia Soprano&#x27;s sister. Pat owns a farm at New York State Route 146, Route 9a, Kinderhook, Upstate New York that his nephews used to visit in the summers of their youth. In the episode &quot;All Due Respect&quot;, Tony Blundetto hides out at Pat&#x27;s now empty farmhouse from the Lupertazzis after shooting Phil Leotardo&#x27;s brother Billy Leotardo.

*Edoardo Ballerini as Corky Caporale: an associate of Christopher Moltisanti and a heroin addict. Christopher enlisted him to accommodate the Italian hitmen provided to Tony for the hit on Rusty Millio. Corky was chosen primarily because he speaks Italian and would therefore be able to communicate effectively with the hitmen. Christopher paid him for the job with heroin. Corky performed well, delivering weapons and instructions at a remote spot without revealing much about himself, and the hit went smoothly. Christopher delivered the second half of Corky&#x27;s payment at the Feast of St. Elzear and included more heroin as a substitute for some of the money. Corky injected the drug in Christopher&#x27;s car, which initially prompted Christopher to encourage him to get into rehab. However, Christopher was eventually tempted into joining him. In 2007, in the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, now after Christopher&#x27;s death, the Soprano Family used Corky again through Patsy Parisi. The target this time was Phil Leotardo. Fluent in Italian, Corky assigned Neapolitan hitmen, Italo and Salvatore to the Leotardo hit, but it was botched when they mistook the father of Leotardo&#x27;s Ukrainian mistress for Leotardo and killed him and his daughter instead. When Corky heard from the hitmen that the man spoke Ukrainian to his daughter, he mumbled &quot;whatever.&quot; However, he did ask Patsy Parisi if Phil spoke Ukrainian.

*Tony Siragusa as Frankie Cortese: he served as a driver and bodyguard for Tony as a soldier of the Soprano crime family in 2004.

Murmur made Christopher&#x27;s rounds while Christopher was in Los Angeles, California – buying credit card numbers from Beansie Gaeta&#x27;s pizzeria and from Hillel Teittleman at the Teittleman&#x27;s Fly Away Motel, then selling the numbers to Mohammed and Ahmed at the Bada Bing. Murmur also went out to LA to meet Christopher because Christopher was &quot;chipping&quot; (relapsing). While there, Murmur and Christopher tried to intimidate Ben Kingsley and robbed Lauren Bacall of a gift basket she received at an awards ceremony. Murmur later attended Christopher&#x27;s belated bachelor party at Nuovo Vesuvio and continued to hang out with the crew at Satriale&#x27;s. Murmur was skeptical of the benefits of Christopher&#x27;s relationship with fellow addict Julianna Skiff, warning Christopher that it could be enabling as codependency (to relapse into substance abuse), and of the possibility of Tony finding out about his recent slip at the Feast of St. Elzear. He was also responsible for informing Tony that Phil Leotardo had a heart attack – Tony had warmed to him a little by this point and rewarded him with a club soda. In 2007, in the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, Murmur (unknowingly) informed Paulie and Silvio, by showing them a newspaper article on the murders of two civilians, that Phil Leotardo was still alive and the job to kill him failed because the hitmen had misidentified their target.

*John Fiore as Gianluigi &quot;Gigi&quot; Cestone: he is involved in the garbage waste business to some capacity and at the time of his death was involved in a very large freon disposal and refrigerant reclamation deal. Former made man in the Junior Soprano crew, defected to Tony Soprano&#x27;s crew in 2000 after he murdered Philly Parisi (the acting capo of Junior&#x27;s crew while Junior was incarcerated). The hit was ordered by Tony as revenge for Philly spreading rumors about Tony&#x27;s mother with regard to Tony and Junior&#x27;s feud. Gigi was quickly made part of the inner circle of Tony&#x27;s crew unlike fellow new member Patsy Parisi. Gigi made a final transition in the fall of 2000 when he was promoted to the position of capo over the Aprile crew, following Richie Aprile&#x27;s &quot;disappearance&quot; making him the only made man in the DiMeo crime family to serve in three different crews. Ralph Cifaretto was angered as he had hoped to receive the promotion himself. Gigi died in the episode &quot;He Is Risen&quot;, after he had a fatal heart attack while constipated on the toilet in his social club. Ralph was subsequently made the captain of the Aprile crew.

*Paul Herman as Peter &quot;Beansie&quot; Gaeta: a former associate of Richie Aprile from Elizabethtown, New Jersey, supervising a drug operation in New Jersey for him. Upon Richie&#x27;s release from prison, he tracked down Gaeta at his pizza parlor and demanded payment that he allegedly still owed to him. His pizzerias are used by the DiMeo crime family for money laundering. After Gaeta denied the validity of the debt, Richie first broke a coffee pot over Beansie&#x27;s head, beat him, and later ran him over with his car, rendering Beansie hospitalized and paraplegic from his injuries (in &quot;Toodle Fucking-Oo&quot;). After this, Beansie began using a wheelchair and moved to Miami Beach, Florida.

*Anthony J. Ribustello as Dante &quot;Buddha&quot; Greco: a soldier in the Aprile crew, first seen taking delivery of cigarettes from Christopher Moltisanti on his return from Raleigh, North Carolina.

*Andrew Davoli as Dino Zerilli: a childhood friend of Jackie Aprile Jr. and partner in crime and an associate in Ralph Cifaretto&#x27;s crew. He was a classmate of Jackie Jr. at Rutgers University. It was his idea to extort protection money from a coffee house at Rutgers and rob the Jewel concert being held at the university, but he was arrested for drug possession and in jail when the robbery was actually pulled. Jackie Jr. and Carlo Renzi feel that Ralph Cifaretto is holding them back from their full potential. He looks up in admiration to Christopher Moltisanti who was at that point in time a rising figure in the DiMeo crime family. He was involved in Jackie Jr.&#x27;s scheme to rob Eugene Pontecorvo&#x27;s low-stakes card game to make names for themselves and gain the respect of the higher-level mobsters. They team up with Carlo Renzi, who wields a heavy shotgun. Things do not go their way when &quot;Sunshine&quot; the card dealer gets whacked during the robbery, triggering a barrage of gunshots from both sides. This scuffle leaves Carlo dead and Furio wounded. Dino and Jackie Jr. run for the street, but their getaway wheelman, Matush, had fled out of fear after hearing the gunshots. Jackie boosts an oncoming car and quickly speeds out of the area, leaving Dino to face an angry Christopher Moltisanti and Albert Barese. Dino tries to save himself by mentioning he&#x27;s with Ralph, but that does not help. Chris and Albert promptly shoot Dino in the face, killing him.

*Richard Maldone as Albert &quot;Ally Boy&quot; Barese: a paternal cousin of Larry Boy Barese; acting capo of the Barese crew when Larry Boy was in jail; soldier in the Barese crew. Larry is involved in price-fixing and bid rigging of waste hauling contracts in New Jersey and New York. In a discussion with Richie Aprile and Tony, Tony says that all the garbage collection routes north of Paterson, New Jersey belong to Barone Sanitation while Larry Boy Barese and his firm Sani-Cruiser and the D&#x27;Allessio brothers divide up the rest. The crew&#x27;s contest for the routes continued as Albert was briefly involved in a &quot;garbage war&quot; with Ralph Cifaretto who claimed to be a &quot;capo&quot; of his own crew. Larry burned two of Ralph Cifaretto&#x27;s dumpsters and Ralph torched one of Larry&#x27;s garbage trucks in West Side, Newark, New Jersey.

*Frank John Hughes as Walden Belfiore: a soldier in the Gervasi crew of the DiMeo Crime Family. He reveals he was named after singer Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto).

In the final episode, Benny Fazio and Belfiore locate Phil Leotardo and Belfiore shoots Phil in the head and chest before making a getaway with Fazio.

*Ron Castellano as Terrence &quot;Terry&quot; Doria: a soldier of Carlo Gervasi&#x27;s crew. It has been speculated that it was Doria who informed the Lupertazzi family of the whereabouts of Vito Spatafore, resulting in Vito&#x27;s murder. Doria had just borrowed $20,000 from Vito, which Vito&#x27;s death meant he would not have to repay.
*Artie Pasquale as Burt Gervasi: a younger paternal cousin to Carlo Gervasi and uncle to Carlo&#x27;s sons Jason and Justin Gervasi. Burt was made a formal member of the Soprano crime family in 2006, at the same time as Phil Leotardo&#x27;s soldier Gerry Torciano was made a capo in the Lupertazzi family. He lives with his wife Lorraine and toy terrier Spencer. He and Patsy Parisi run the North Ward Emergency Merchants Protective Cooperative: an extortion racket hitting storeowners in New Jersey. As revealed in the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, according to Silvio Dante, Burt was eventually swayed to take the side of the Lupertazzi Family and went to Silvio to convince him to go along in a coup d&#x27;état, but Silvio instead responded by garroting him to death in his home the next day.

*Robert Desiderio as &quot;Black&quot; Jack Massarone: he is the owner of Massarone Brothers Construction in Fairfield, New Jersey. In 2004, Jack had become a federal informant and wore a wire concealed in a baseball cap to several meetings with Tony. In a discussion between Frank Cubitoso and the District Attorney at FBI headquarters, it is said that Massarone is offering information on the stolen airline tickets case involving Livia Soprano in 2002, the jury-tampering investigation of Junior Soprano&#x27;s RICO trial, and the Matthew Bevilaqua murder in 2000. But the D.A. tells Cubitoso that even if Massarone and a hundred other snitches were called to testify against Tony Soprano it would not be enough to convict him in a trial. Tony realized something was off when he was tipped off by Patsy Parisi that the FBI had staked out one of his meetings with Massarone at the &quot;Neapolitan Diner&quot; in Fairfield, New Jersey. Raising Tony&#x27;s suspicions further was the fact that Massarone gave him a framed picture of the Rat Pack at that meeting, and later asked him if he had lost weight. Jack was murdered and found in the trunk of his car with a golf club cover stuffed in his mouth.

*Sig Libowitz as Hillel Teittleman: a Hasidic Jew and co-owner of a motel with his brother-in-law Ariel who worked there with his father-in-law. In 1999, his brother-in-law Ariel used his ending marriage to negotiate a share in the Teitlemann&#x27;s motel. However, Hillel&#x27;s father Shlomo contracted the Soprano family to intimidate Ariel against Hillel&#x27;s advice. In 2006, Hillel was involved in Benny Fazio&#x27;s credit card number scheme – selling card information to Soprano crew associate Murmur.

They later seek help from Christopher in purchasing TEC-9 semi-automatic pistols, which they claim they need &quot;for a family matter&quot;. In the episode &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;, Tony passed their names and Ahmed&#x27;s cell phone number to the FBI. The FBI agents do not recognize them at first, but later tell Tony they may be involved in terrorism financing. In the series finale &quot;Made in America&quot;, Tony passes details of their Mitner First Merchants&#x27; Bank to Agent Harris hoping to gain information on Phil Leotardo&#x27;s location in return.

*Nick Tarabay as Matush Giamona: an ecstasy dealer who has had some association with the Soprano/DiMeo business over the years. He was often found in and around the West Long Branch, New Jersey alternative rock Crazy Horse nightclub owned by Adriana LaCerva, and initially, Furio and Chris were hostile to him and threw him off the premises. With the reassurance of Jackie Jr., he returned to dealing outside the club and was put in the hospital by Furio, in traction with his jaw wired shut. Chris did not want Matush dealing inside The Crazy Horse because ecstasy was a class A narcotic and would bring the attention of drug task forces. Matush was later recruited as a driver in Jackie Junior&#x27;s failed robbery of a card game in 2001. He bolted with the car as soon as the robbery went awry, leaving Dino Zerilli to be caught and killed and forcing Jackie Jr. to improvise his own escape. In 2004, Matush had returned to dealing at the Crazy Horse – Adriana&#x27;s drug habit and Furio&#x27;s disappearance made the club more welcoming. He murdered an upset customer, named Gilbert Nieves, in Adriana&#x27;s office, and forced her to help him dispose of the body. Another dealer, Kamal, was also involved. This was recorded by FBI surveillance outside and was instrumental in Adriana&#x27;s attempt to flip Christopher which resulted in her death.

*Gregory Alan Williams as Reverend Herman James Jr.: he is from Newark, New Jersey and his heritage can be traced back to Confederation, when his grandfather was a slave on a plantation. His father was WWII veteran and a United Association plumber and belonged to the same union as the one they were extorting. Herman arranged a secret deal with Tony, assisting in a shakedown of a Massarone Brothers construction and real estate development company: James organized a group of African-American union plumbers to argue about being paid low wages because of perceived racial employment discrimination by Black Jack Massarone at a job site. The Soprano associates Sean Gismonte, Matt Bevilaqua and Bobby Baccalieri Jr. then attacked with baseball bats, adding drama to the protest and causing a riot. James and Soprano then split the earnings. He is a friend of Assemblyman Ronald Zellman.

*Richard Portnow as Harold Melvoin: he is Junior Soprano&#x27;s lawyer from 1999 to 2004. Following Junior&#x27;s arrest on Federal Racketeering charges, Mel allows him to use his office to conduct business as it is one of the few places he is allowed to visit while under house arrest. He allows Junior and Tony to use his office to meet with Angelo Garepe and Lorraine Calluzzo. It is also one of the places that the FBI is not allowed to wiretap. He conducts Junior&#x27;s defense throughout his first RICO trial and helps Junior with such schemes as hiring an audio engineer expert witness and sound engineer minimization expert to dispute what is recorded on the tapes from Green Grove Retirement Home, getting him released from house arrest so he can attend several funerals including Jackie Aprile Sr., Jackie Aprile Jr., Bobby Baccalieri Sr., Karen Baccalieri and Febby DeAngelis, exaggerating about a benign malignant growth on Junior&#x27;s body to get him a compassionate release and pretending that a (presumably) minor head injury from being hit by a boom microphone and falling on the Mitchell H. Cohen United States Courthouse steps in Camden, New Jersey has affected his cognitive ability to stand trial. Hal charges Junior $1,000,000 for his RICO trial. Following his stroke, it is predicted that it will be nine months to a year before he will be able to work a full schedule again and that they will have to postpone Junior&#x27;s trial. After having a stroke that affects his ability to speak, Melvoin is fired by Junior, who considers his attorney&#x27;s weakened condition a reminder of his own mortality.

*David Margulies as Neil Mink: he is Tony Soprano&#x27;s lawyer. He advises Tony to stay off the street and distance himself from the day-to-day work of his crew – this contributes to Tony&#x27;s insulating himself by communicating through closely trusted friends whenever possible. He also advises Tony to spend more time in his legitimate businesses, such as Barone Sanitation, instead of the Bada Bing. When Janice Soprano attacks another soccer mom at Sophia Baccalieri&#x27;s soccer game in Essex County, New Jersey at Summit Avenue Park in The Palisades, Janice wants to sue the Essex County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for wrongful arrest. But Tony demands that Janice see Neil and plea the charges down so as to not increase media attention and not make it a cause célèbre. In the final episode, &quot;Made in America&quot;, Mink informs Tony that the government most likely will indict him on federal weapons charges stemming from the arrest made in &quot;Soprano Home Movies&quot; at the beginning of the season, and it is strongly implied that he could consequently be facing a prison sentence for Criminal possession of a weapon. He also says that the Essex County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office has a witness testifying for a grand jury, but whose identity is unknown, although it is believed to be Carlo Gervasi.

*Peter Riegert as Ronald Zellman: an Assemblyman (member of the lower house of the state legislature) for the East Ward consisting of Four Corners (Newark), Five Corners, Newark, Gateway Center (Newark) and The Ironbound and acted as a political operative on behalf of the Soprano crime family. He aided them in securing the Esplanade gentrification construction contract and the mixed commercial real estate and condominium development at Pennsylvania Station (Newark) that was developed by Black Jack Massarone. Zellman was a friend of the Reverend Herman James Jr. and helped Tony set up the HUD scam by introducing him to Maurice Tiffen, a friend of Zellman&#x27;s from his days at the University of Michigan. His influence later allowed A.J. to be released from police custody, with no charges filed, following his failed attempt to kill his great-uncle Junior, in the Wycoff Rehabilitation Clinic in Wyckoff, New Jersey.

===Lupertazzi crime family===

*Patti D&#x27;Arbanville as Lorraine Calluzzo: an associate of the Lupertazzi crime family, known as &quot;the lady shylock.&quot; During the infighting following boss Carmine Lupertazzi&#x27;s death in 2004, Lorraine kicked up to Little Carmine, who was also reportedly her lover as well as her second cousin. Phil Leotardo roughed her up and even shot at her (using a telephone directory to stop the bullet) during a shakedown, warning her to stop cutting in Little Carmine. Lorraine sought a sit down with Tony Soprano through Angelo Garepe to ask him to intercede in the Lupertazzi infighting. During a sit-down, Christopher suggests that John asks for a share of Little Carmine&#x27;s nightclub businesses in South Beach, Miami and let him keep Lorraine under his crew, something John turns down saying if he wanted Little Carmine&#x27;s businesses he&#x27;d move to Miami. Tony suggests that John Sacrimoni, Angelo Garepe, and Little Carmine operate the family under a triumvirate to help keep the peace with Lorraine because Carmine Sr. did not name a successor. Lorraine and her lover are eventually murdered at her home by Phil, his brother William &quot;Billy&quot; Leotardo, and associate Joseph &quot;Joey Peeps&quot; Peparelli.

*Michael DeNigris as Charles &quot;Chucky&quot; Cinelli: he is the owner of Cinelli Sanitation – the Lupertazzi crime family&#x27;s waste management front in Jamaica, Queens where John Sacramoni works. He was involved in a dispute with Jason Barone over Newark, New Jersey–based Barone Sanitation following the death of Dick Barone in 2006 which ended with his buying the company and merging. While going over the payroll he finds discrepancies with consultant Tony Soprano, Paulie Gualtieri, and Johnny Sack, but is told to mind his own business by a savvy employee who is in the know. Cinelli agrees (as dictated to by John Sacrimoni) to keep Tony Soprano employed until 2009 (this is later extended to 2015) as a waste management consultant and to keep his health insurance package and Form W-2, plus 5% (later increased to 12%) of Barone Sanitation sale price, in exchange to give up his share of skimming profits ($2,000 a month), and that Cinelli leases him a new car. A Barone Sanitation employee is badly beaten by mob-associated Cinelli Sanitation workers over the dispute. John Sacrimoni is on the payroll as a waste management consultant at Cinelli Sanitation, even after his incarceration. Jason tries to convince Charles to compensate Tony Soprano and Paulie Gualtieri in the sale of Barone Sanitation, something that Cinelli is adamant against, telling Jason it could come out of his end. Jason tells Chuckie that he wants to redefine the deal and open up the sale to other potential buyers.

*Armen Garo as Salvatore &quot;Coco&quot; Cogliano: he is a soldier in the Lupertazzi crime family. While inebriated from drinking Sambuca with Albie Cianflone, he makes aggressively lewd remarks to Meadow Soprano while she is on a dinner date with Patrick Parisi (son of Patsy Parisi) in Little Italy, Manhattan. Shortly after the date, Meadow tells Tony of the incident but he brushes it off as public intoxication, Tony Soprano severely pistol-whips and curb-stomps him in his restaurant, knocking his teeth out in the presence of Butch DeConcini. This leads Phil Leotardo to shut down a Hackensack, New Jersey shopping mall construction site with a United Association plumber&#x27;s strike, for which Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. has the scaffolding contract. Carmine Jr. says that in attacking Coco he was being prudent. Carmine Jr. brokers a meeting with Butch DeConcini and Phil and offers Phil a pallet of Makita drills as a peace offering over the attack on Coco. Phil mentions the attack on Salvatore, the forced disappearance and murder of Dominick Gamiello in &quot;Cold Stones&quot; and the murder of his brother Billy Leotardo in &quot;Long Term Parking&quot; as a reason to murder the entire upper management of the DiMeo crime family. Butchie says that &quot;Coco&quot; is an okay guy which suggests that he has good standing in the Lupertazzi crime family, but Tony suggests that, possibly, he is a borderline alcoholic. His name could have been taken from former Lucchese crime family underboss and acting boss, Ettore (&quot;Eddie&quot;) Coco, who served under Carmine Tramunti.

*Dominic Chianese Jr. as Dominic: he is a member of the Lupertazzi crime family.

*Frank Fortunato as Jason Evanina: he is a partner of Lorraine Calluzzo. During the infighting following boss Carmine Lupertazzi&#x27;s death, Lorraine kicked up to Little Carmine.

Jason is killed off-screen, as Lorraine tries to escape, she is killed by Billy not far from where she discovers Jason&#x27;s dead body.

*Tony Cucci as Dominic &quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamiello: he is a made man of the Lupertazzi crime family under Phil Leotardo. Gamiello joined with Gerry Torciano in murdering Vito in a hotel in Fort Lee, New Jersey because of Vito&#x27;s homosexuality, while Leotardo watched. He commented to Phil Leotardo that Vito was &quot;a disgrace&quot; to organized crime. He runs a high-stakes card game in Canarsie, Brooklyn. Later, Dom visited Satriale&#x27;s to deliver money to Silvio Dante and Carlo Gervasi. Although Fat Dom starts passive-aggressively insulting Vito and crudely implies that Gervasi is homosexual, Silvio silenced him with a blow to the back of the head with a dustbuster. Silvio told Carlo to just &quot;hit him&quot; but Carlo repeatedly and fatally stabbed Dominic in the stomach with a butcher knife. Dominic&#x27;s murder infuriated Tony Soprano and Silvio and Carlo closed Satriale&#x27;s to dispose of the body. Carlo and Silvio first planned to dismember his body but finally decided to bury it at a construction site and ditch the car somewhere along the U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey. They decapitate Dom off-screen when dismembering his corpse. Carlo was seen disposing of Dom&#x27;s severed head (which he was keeping in a deep freezer at his house on the Jersey Shore) at the beginning of the next episode, by shoving it down a storm drain along Connecticut Route 3.

*Joe Santos as Angelo Garepe: he is consigliere to Carmine Lupertazzi for 30 years (1956 to 1986) before his incarceration at United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth where he served 18 years. Infighting occurred amongst the members of the Lupertazzi crime family following Carmine&#x27;s death. Angelo chose Little Carmine&#x27;s side along with capo Rusty Millio. During the infighting, Angelo recruited his old friend, Tony Blundetto, to murder Joseph &quot;Joey Peeps&quot; Peparelli—an associate of Johnny Sack and member of Phil Leotardo&#x27;s crew. Following this, Phil and his brother, Billy Leotardo, killed Angelo. Angelo&#x27;s murder had two major repercussions—it caused Little Carmine to forfeit, making Johnny Sack the undisputed successor to Carmine, Sr. It also provoked Tony Blundetto to pursue the Leotardos, shooting and killing Billy Leotardo while wounding Phil. This nearly started a war between the New York and New Jersey crews, and anger from this conflict remained until the conclusion of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

*Lou Martini Jr. as Anthony Infante: he is Ginny Sacrimoni&#x27;s brother and Johnny Sack&#x27;s brother-in-law. Infante is an optometrist, but also serves as a reluctant back-channel through which Tony Soprano and Johnny Sack communicates while Johnny is in federal detention.

*Greg D&#x27;Agostino as Jimmy Lauria: he is an associate of the Little Italy, Manhattan Leotardo crew. Takes part in the beat down on Hesh&#x27;s son-in-law Eli in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, with Gerry Torciano. Phil thought that Eli was an independent loanshark who was lending out money without making payments to Gerry. Later attends the meeting with Tony, Hesh, Phil Leotardo and Gerry Torciano to make restitution for Hesh&#x27;s son-in-law&#x27;s injuries from a hit and run that happened when Eli tried to run from Jimmy and Gerry. They agree to pay $50,000 for pain and suffering.

Billy killed Lorraine Calluzzo and Jason Evanina with his friend Joe Peeps. Following Carmine Lupertazzi&#x27;s death, a power struggle between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine ensued. One side was led by Carmine&#x27;s underboss, Johnny Sack, while the other was ostensibly led by Carmine&#x27;s son and Miami capo, &quot;Little Carmine&quot; Lupertazzi. Joe Peeps was killed soon after and Billy took part in the response – a hit on Angelo Garepe in &quot;The Test Dream&quot;. Billy himself was killed in &quot;All Due Respect,&quot; by Tony Blundetto in revenge for the death of his friend Angelo, causing lasting distress to his brother Phil, who was wounded in the attack. He is cremated and his urn is kept on a shelf behind the bar of Phil Leotardo&#x27;s Little Italy social club.

*Joe Maruzzo as Joseph &quot;Joey Peeps&quot; Peparelli: he is an associate in Phil Leotardo&#x27;s crew and an aide-de-camp to Johnny Sack, often going to high-level sit-downs with him. Joey had contacted an Asian hitman &quot;Jerry from Fort Lauderdale, Florida&quot; that Johnny ordered to kill Ralph in Delray Beach, Florida, and subsequently tells the hitman to call off the murder when Johnny decides against it, agreeing to pay him half for his trouble. During the infighting amongst the Lupertazzi crime family, Joey and Billy Leotardo kill lady shylock Lorraine Calluzzo, and her partner Jason Evanina, for kicking payments up to Little Carmine instead of to Johnny Sack. In retaliation, Soprano family member Tony Blundetto is hired for a hit on Joey, who is shot to death along with a prostitute in the front seat of his Lincoln Town Car when leaving a Manhattan brothel that he collects protection money from. At Joey&#x27;s funeral, Tony Soprano is aghast that his crew had a formal headstone carved with the name &quot;Peeps,&quot; instead of his proper surname &quot;Peparelli.&quot;

Later, he sits in on one of the discussions with Tony and Phil over the Tony Blundetto situation and tells Phil that he gets emotional when he drinks wine. He is also the one that notifies Tony Soprano by telephone from a deli in Little Italy, Manhattan in code that John Sacrimoni took over the reign of the family from Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. in a bloodless coup. However, it is revealed in &quot;All Due Respect&quot; that Petrille had been a cooperating witness with the FBI and gave up information on transport truck hijacking and drug dealing going back to Sacrimoni&#x27;s criminal activities in 1981, which was instrumental in Johnny&#x27;s arrest by the Brooklyn District Attorney and the FBI.

*Nick Annunziata as Eddie Pietro: he is a soldier in Rusty Millio&#x27;s crew and his right-hand man. Eddie was shot in the head multiple times alongside Rusty by Italo and Salvatore while backing out of Rusty&#x27;s driveway.

*Daniel P. Conte as Faustino &quot;Doc&quot; Santoro: he is an aging Mustache Pete in the Lupertazzi crime family. Santoro ordered a hit on Gerry Torciano. Torciano was the perceived successor to Phil Leotardo. Doc had him brazenly murdered while he ate dinner with Silvio Dante. Phil avenges his long-felt humiliations and has Doc murdered, along with his bodyguard, outside a massage parlor and brothel in Chinatown, Manhattan, cementing his own claim to be the boss. One of the gunmen shoots out Santoro&#x27;s right eye. Butch DeConcini is one of the getaway drivers. Tony Soprano and the crew learn of Santoro&#x27;s murder from watching a televised news report at the Bada Bing.

*John Bianco as Gerardo &quot;Gerry The Hairdo&quot; Torciano: he was a protégé of Phil Leotardo. Torciano and Jimmy Lauria got into an altercation with Hesh Rabkin and his son-in-law Eli over extortion money collections being done on the crew&#x27;s territory in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. Torciano&#x27;s men burned them out of his car, beat up Eli, and slugged Rabkin. As Eli fled he was hit by a taxi cab in a hit and run and hospitalized. Later, Torciano apologized to Tony, claiming that he thought Eli was a civilian, and paid Eli $50,000 in restitution for his injuries. He was made official captain in 2006. Dominick &quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamiello and Torciano murdered Vito Spatafore in his motel room while Leotardo watched. When Santoro took over from Sacrimoni, Gerry told Silvio Dante that he was surprised that Phil Leotardo seemed to have lost his drive to become boss of the Lupertazzi family. On April 15, 2007, Gerry died at the hands of a hitman (on orders from Faustino &quot;Doc&quot; Santoro) in a Brooklyn, New York restaurant while dining with Soprano family consigliere Silvio Dante who was used as a diversion and their respective dates. John Sacrimoni hears about Gerry&#x27;s death from an orderly in the prison hospital.

*John &quot;Cha-Cha&quot; Ciarcia as Albert &quot;Albie&quot; Cianflone: he is the reputed consigliere to Phil Leotardo. Albie is a former soldier in the Leotardo crew and has worked for Phil Leotardo since the 1980s. After Johnny Sack was arrested and indicted on various charges, Phil was promoted to acting boss, and Albie was made new consigliere. Albie helped mediate the Barone Sanitation dispute with the Soprano crime family. Alongside newly made underboss Butch DeConcini, Albie was one of Phil&#x27;s most trusted advisors and confidants. After Phil hatches the plot to kill the entire regime of the Soprano crime family, Albie first protests in shock that taking out an entire family is impossible, however, he later agrees with Phil&#x27;s decision. Along with Butch, Albie plans the executions of Tony Soprano, Silvio Dante, and Bobby Baccalieri. In the final episode, &quot;Made in America&quot;, Albie meets with Tony, Paulie Gualtieri, Little Carmine, Butch DeConcini, and George Paglieri, in New York, where the Lupertazzis agree to end their war with the Sopranos.

*Frank Pando as Frank Grasso: he is an FBI agent who was with the Newark FBI Organized Crime Division Task Force with an office in 11 Center Place Newark, New Jersey. He handled mob capo and informant Raymond Curto, who he planned to have testify as a cooperating witness against Tony Soprano and Ralph Cifaretto, among others. During a raid on the North Caldwell, New Jersey Soprano residence, Grasso broke a bowl from the kitchen refrigerator. Immediately after, he and Tony developed a grudge when Tony noted his last name and insulted him in Italian. He is an homage to famous New York City Detective Sonny Grosso who helped reveal the French Connection. Tony says that if it weren&#x27;t for Grasso&#x27;s last name they&#x27;d have him sweeping up at the office, and implies that the other FBI agents probably search him before he leaves work to go home every day. Tony thinks that Grasso is arresting &quot;his own people&quot;, fellow Italian-Americans, to get promoted.

*Karen Young as Robyn Sanseverino: she is an FBI agent who handled Adriana La Cerva after Adriana became very resentful against Agent Ciccerone. She also handled capo Raymond Curto just before his death from natural causes.

*Lola Glaudini as Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrup: she is a special agent who went undercover as &quot;Danielle Ciccolella from Whippany, New Jersey&quot; to befriend Adriana in order to uncover information about Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s relationship with Tony Soprano. She is married to FBI Special Agent Mike Waldrup and has a child with him. She poses as a wealthy woman and makes contact with Adriana in a Nutley, New Jersey, dress shop. Her usefulness as an undercover agent ended after four and a half months when Adriana saw Christopher try to seduce her, causing Adriana to break off their friendship. However, Deborah did uncover drug use at Adriana&#x27;s club which the FBI hangs over Adriana&#x27;s head to motivate her to become an informant. She later meets Adriana at a bakery in East Hanover Township, New Jersey after her Danielle identity is dropped. Tony later asked Adriana about her friend Danielle, and she awkwardly tells him that she drowned, hence her disappearance. In the episode &quot;Long Term Parking&quot;, Adriana finally tells Christopher about Danielle&#x27;s true identity, after revealing her own involvement with the FBI to him. The first appearance of Deborah Ciccerone in &quot;Army of One&quot; was initially aired with Fairuza Balk in the role until she was recast, and the scene replaced with Glaudini.

He did not see much of his mother Janice. Janice attempted to send Harpo to military school in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the same one that Tony tries to send AJ to, but Tony says that &quot;Janice was too late for him.&quot; Janice never told Bobby the Third or Sophia Baccalieri about their step-brother until Tony brought it up during a family dinner. In the episode &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot;, Janice mentions that Harpo had become homeless when Tony proposes flying him in for Livia&#x27;s funeral.

Tracee later met Ralph at the Bada Bing lounge, where she insulted him in front of the other associates and capos. Ralph followed her out to the deserted parking lot, where he teased her into thinking he would actually marry and support her. He then abruptly changed his tone and gleefully made snide remarks that her daughter would end up as a &quot;cocksucking slob&quot; just like her.

Shortly thereafter she appears as the last in a series of home health nurses the Sopranos hire to care for Livia Soprano, after her primary caregiver and daughter, Janice, suddenly flees town in the aftermath of Richie Aprile&#x27;s death. After Livia dies, Tony allows Svetlana to continue living in Livia&#x27;s house, until she can find her own place to live. She later works as a temporary replacement for Uncle Junior&#x27;s nurse, Branca (who works for her), after he falls at the courthouse.

Subsequently, after not being able to bear any more of Ralph&#x27;s inclinations, she breaks up with Ralph and begins dating Tony exclusively, which Tony later reveals to Ralph. As Ralph is rather preoccupied at that time with his son Justin&#x27;s severe medical condition, he shrugs it off and is seemingly indifferent about it. In the Season 5 episode &quot;The Test Dream&quot;, after she pushes Tony to make a decision about staying with his wife or being committed to her, her robe catches fire while trying to cook for Tony. Tony quickly extinguishes the fire, but Valentina sustains second degree burns on her scalp. Although it is soon discovered that Valentina will fully heal from the wounds without the need for skin grafts or any scarring, Tony breaks the news to her that he is going back to Carmela.

At the Bada Bing, Tony seduced Julianna but she told him she was going to exercise self-control and decline because she was engaged. Despite Tony&#x27;s initial misgivings, her third offer was high enough for him to accept the deal. Tony met her at her home to sign the papers, and they started kissing and began to undress one another, but Tony abruptly ends the encounter and walks out. Following her rejection by Tony, Julianna went to an AA meeting. There she met Christopher Moltisanti who was also in attendance and who remembered her from when she first approached Tony at Satriale&#x27;s. He introduced himself after the meeting and invited her for coffee, which prompted the beginning of an extramarital affair. Tony reinitiated his pursuit of Julianna when they met to close the Caputo&#x27;s Poultry real estate deal and she was initially polite in declining any further contact with him.

Tony later pranked Bruce by asking him to hold onto a package filled with sand for him, for an unspecified length of time, without telling Bruce what was in it. Bruce and his wife were tempted to open the package but terrified to know what it held. Heroin or a gun were their guesses.

In the episode &quot;Kennedy and Heidi&quot;, she died on a chartered bus of a stroke while returning from a production of &quot;The Jersey Boys&quot;, however, her funeral was poorly attended, as a majority of the people went to Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s concurrent funeral, much to Paulie&#x27;s ire as he felt Christopher always out-shined him in life, and even manages it in death.

The two soon reconcile after Vito decides to &quot;stop living a lie&quot; and became Jim&#x27;s live-in lover. The pair enjoyed romantic dinners, motorcycle rides, and picnicking lakeside. He gets Vito a job as a contractor working for some of his friends, a job which turns out to be very slow-paced. Ultimately, Vito missed his family and fast-paced lifestyle back in New Jersey too much to stay with Jim. Vito left Jim&#x27;s house early one morning to return to New Jersey while Jim was still asleep. Vito would later call Jim, but Jim was still angry over the way Vito had left and wanted nothing more to do with him. Vito was violently murdered soon thereafter.

*Geraldine LiBrandi as Patty Leotardo: she is married to the Lupertazzi crime family acting boss Phil Leotardo. Being a fervent and conservative Catholic, Patty was a factor in Phil&#x27;s decision to kill Vito Spatafore after they discovered he was homosexual, telling Phil that Vito had to be made to face his &quot;sin.&quot; While on the run, Patty was in the driver&#x27;s seat when Phil was shot dead outside their car at a gas station in the series finale. After he&#x27;s shot, she rushes out the door with the car still in drive, and the doors locked, resulting in Phil&#x27;s head being run over by the car.

*Denise Borino as Ginny &quot;Ginny Sack&quot; Sacrimoni: she is married to John &quot;Johnny Sack&quot; Sacrimoni and the mother of Catherine and Allegra Marie Sacrimoni. She is obese, but John loves her as she is, describing her as &quot;&quot;. Johnny Sack mentions that Ginny has worked very hard on trying to lose her weight. Ginny&#x27;s figure is the subject of numerous jokes by members of the DiMeo crime family, and this leads to a dispute between her husband and Ralph Cifaretto. Johnny is willing to kill to defend her honor and viciously attacks a member of Ralph&#x27;s crew, who Johnny mistakenly believes was telling jokes at Ginny&#x27;s expense. Ginny attended her daughter Allegra&#x27;s wedding and was ecstatic when Johnny was allowed to attend, despite being in prison awaiting trial. Her day ended on a low note when US Marshals blocked her daughter&#x27;s departure and dragged her sobbing husband off in handcuffs causing Ginny to faint. Ginny was in court when Johnny admitted his involvement with the Mafia and received a 15-year sentence for racketeering. John and his lawyer make a plea agreement for his vintage Wurlitzer juke box, $180,000 in a safety deposit box under her father-in-law&#x27;s name in Boca Raton, Florida, cash and investment portfolios with The Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments, his 401(k) and severance package from Essany Scaffolding, $450,000 condominium in Deal, New Jersey, his Maserati Coupe, Ginny&#x27;s GMC Yukon, John&#x27;s net worth totaling $5 million and his house and contents valued at $1.2 million and fifteen-years in exchange for John&#x27;s allocution. This is later reduced to their North Caldwell, New Jersey home, $45,000 in equity from his daughters&#x27; variable universal life insurance policies, and Ginny&#x27;s individual retirement account that she started when she worked the tie sales counter at Wanamaker&#x27;s worth close to $110,000 to which Ron encourages John to take. She was forced to move when John arranged the sale of their home to Janice Soprano as part of an agreement with Tony to try to secure capital, for his family, following the asset seizures by the US Marshals and Treasury Department that came with his conviction. Ginny visited her husband John in prison when he was diagnosed with cancer and was at his side with their two daughters when he died. Tony later mentions that she took a white-collar office job for an insurance company. Denise Borino, who portrayed Ginny, received the part in a 2000 open casting call. She had attended the casting in order to support a friend.

*Caitlin Van Zandt as Allegra Marie Sacrimoni: she is the daughter of Johnny and Ginny Sack and sister to Catherine Sacrimoni. Johnny paid for her lavish wedding to Eric DeBenedetto while Johnny was in prison awaiting trial. Johnny was released to attend the wedding and Allegra was ecstatic that her father would be in attendance, but the judge&#x27;s conditions meant that Allegra had to put up with metal detectors and US Marshals at the ceremony and reception. Her reception ended on a low note with her departing limousine being blocked in by the Marshals&#x27; SUVs, her father breaking down in tears as he was forcibly led away in handcuffs, and her mother fainting in the crowd. Allegra was at her father&#x27;s side, along with her mother and older sister, when he died of lung cancer in a prison hospital.

*Cristin Milioti as Catherine Sacrimoni: she is the daughter of Johnny and Ginny Sack and sister to Allegra Sacrimoni. She is noticably much more slim than her Mother and Sister.

*Will Janowitz as Finn DeTrolio: he is Meadow Soprano&#x27;s boyfriend and later fiancé. The two met at Columbia University and began sharing an apartment together in her sophomore year. He is originally from Mission Viejo, California and is of half-Italian descent. Upon finishing college, Finn enrolled in dental school. For a brief period, Finn worked at a construction site run by the Aprile crew, a job with the Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America that Tony Soprano got for him. One morning, he arrived very early to work and saw Vito Spatafore fellating a security guard in a parked vehicle. Finn talked to Meadow about what he saw but she promised to keep his confidence. After Vito tried to intimidate Finn into attending a San Diego Padres and New York Yankees game with him, Finn panicked and decided to leave town before Vito came after him. Meadow was saddened and angered when Finn packed a suitcase without telling her or inviting her to accompany him and they argued. During the argument and when Meadow talked about a commitment, they decided to get engaged. When Vito was spotted in a gay bar by two New York crew members making a collection, Meadow revealed Finn&#x27;s secret to her mother and Rosalie Aprile. A visibly frightened Finn was brought to Satriale&#x27;s to give his account of what he saw and his subsequent encounter with Vito to the senior members of the Soprano crime family. Meadow and Finn later broke up.

*Ari Graynor as Caitlin Rucker: she is Meadow Soprano&#x27;s roommate at Columbia University. Caitlin hails from Bartlesville, Oklahoma, but left home for New York City to attend university. She has manic-depressive disorder and frequently annoyed Meadow and the dormitory Resident Assistant and Meadow&#x27;s boyfriend, Noah Tannenbaum, with her troubles. In &quot;Mr. Ruggiero&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot; she tells Meadow that she&#x27;s stopped drinking and that the school doctor gave her a prescription for Buspirone, which Hunter comments is given to treat generalized anxiety disorder.

*Michele DeCesare (daughter of series creator David Chase) as Hunter Scangarelo: she is a friend of Meadow Soprano. She sang with Meadow in the school choir and the two hounded Chris to buy the crystal meth to help them study, instead of going to Jefferson Avenue in Jersey City, New Jersey. She had a crush on Brendan Filone shortly before his death. In the final episode of the series, Carmela finds her talking to Meadow in Meadow&#x27;s bedroom and casually mentions Hunter&#x27;s expulsion from college years earlier. Carmela is then quietly dismayed to learn that Hunter sorted her life out, went back to college at SUNY Purchase, and is now in medical school.

*Patrick Tully as Noah Tannenbaum: he is Meadow Soprano&#x27;s first boyfriend at Columbia University; they met during a film course. Noah is from West Los Angeles. His father, an entertainment attorney for various celebrities and Hollywood notables is Ashkenazic Jewish and his mother is African American. Noah first appears while visiting the Soprano home with Meadow to view a movie for a class project. Being a film buff, Noah thought he had common ground with Tony when he observed video equipment at the Soprano residence. Noticing that Noah was pursuing Meadow, Tony asked Noah some questions about his ethnic background. Upon confirmation of Noah&#x27;s African American heritage, Tony attempted to intimidate Noah into staying away from Meadow, hurling racial slurs. Following this heated discussion, Noah leaves the house in a huff. This started a lengthy feud between Tony and Meadow which ultimately drove Noah and Meadow closer together. After a visit from his father, Noah broke up with Meadow, saying she is &quot;too negative.&quot;

*Emily Wickersham as Rhiannon Flammer: she is a friend of A.J.&#x27;s, who initially dates Hernan. She later encounters A.J. in a Psychiatric hospital while he is recovering from his suicide attempt. They hang out together and, when they begin to have intercourse in the woods in A.J.&#x27;s Nissan Xterra, the vehicle&#x27;s catalytic converter overheats causing a vehicle fire and sets fire to the dry leaves below it and A.J. and Rhiannon scramble out safely; the truck explodes soon afterward.

*Mark Karafin as Egon Kosma: he is a friend of A.J.
* Paul Dano as Patrick Whalen: he is a friend of A.J.
*Vincent Piazza as Hernan O&#x27;Brien: he is a friend of A.J.

*Jessica Dunphy as Devin Pillsbury: she is A.J.&#x27;s girlfriend in Seasons 4 and 5. Devin is from an even wealthier family than A.J. and this causes a little friction between them when he first learns this.

*Dania Ramirez as Blanca Selgado: she is A.J. Soprano&#x27;s Dominican-American 30-year-old girlfriend, whom he met while working at the construction site. Blanca has a 3-year-old son named Hector from a previous marriage and lives in an apartment building in South Passaic. Blanca lives in a neighborhood that had been disturbed by a youth gang, which A.J. steps up to deal with. He convinces the gang members to move on by bribing them with a bicycle. A.J. eventually proposes marriage to Blanca and she accepts, but later changes her mind and ends the relationship, sending A.J. into an emotional downward spiral that results in an attempted suicide.

*Cameron Boyd as Matt Testa: he is a friend of A.J.

*Tim Daly as Jordan Thomas “J.T.” Dolan: he is a screenwriter and an acquaintance of Christopher Moltisanti from rehab in Hazlet, New Jersey. He became addicted to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol and later lost his job after not completing a script for &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. He later went to a rehabilitation clinic in Pennsylvania (where he first met Christopher) and was successful in turning his life around. J.T. dabbles in gambling, places horse bets with Christopher, and finds a fondness for high-price poker games. J.T. borrows money from Christopher to play high-stakes poker and their friendship is effectively ended when he fails to pay it back on time. Little Paulie Germani and Chris beat J.T. up in his home and confiscate his BMW as partial payment for his debts. Despite the beating, Chris later resumes their &quot;friendship&quot; when the debt has caused J.T. to relapse. As J.T. Dolan is enrolling in rehab again, Chris freezes the debt and assures J.T. that he will return to prosperous screenwriting. Later, as J.T was working in Los Angeles, California as a full-time professor of a writer&#x27;s class &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Block&quot;, Chris has J.T. forcibly abducted by &quot;Murmur&quot; and Benny Fazio and offers to clear the gambling debt if J.T. writes a screenplay for his feature movie project. He also gets a meeting with René Balcer. J.T. agrees and writes the script for &quot;Cleaver&quot;, a slasher horror film, from a story by Christopher, working on the film closely with Moltisanti and Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. who is its co-executive producer. However, when the film gets made in 2007, at its premiere, Christopher does not acknowledge Dolan&#x27;s contributions to it when talking to the audience, leaving him embarrassed in front of his female companions. When Christopher relapsed again in 2007, after his latest feud with Paulie Gualtieri and assumed ridicule and disrespect by the crime family, he attempted to find comfort by talking to J.T. one night. J.T. was cold and unreceptive, angry at his unannounced intrusion, and under pressure to finish a script deadline for &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. Heavily drunk, Christopher said that he had seen and done terrible things and started hinting his knowledge of mob crimes. J.T. angrily tried to get Christopher to stop talking about them, suggesting that he did not want to know. J.T. exclaimed &quot;Chris, you&#x27;re in the Mafia!&quot;, Christopher walked away, then turned and shot him in the head, killing him instantly.

*Patty McCormack as Liz La Cerva: she is the mother of Adriana La Cerva and the sister of Jackie Aprile Sr. and Richie Aprile and sister-in-law to Rosalie Aprile. Liz did not support Adriana&#x27;s relationship with Christopher Moltisanti and Adriana often stayed with her following arguments or domestic violence. When Chris proposes to Adriana in front of Liz, she explains Chris&#x27; behavior as abusive power and control. Following Adriana&#x27;s disappearance in 2004, Liz was visited by the FBI who informed her that her daughter was believed to be dead and that they suspected Chris&#x27; involvement. When Carmela Soprano encountered her at the 2006 Feast of St. Elzear, Liz, having become convinced of her daughter&#x27;s murder, showed evident signs of depression. She later attempted suicide. Carmela visited her in the hospital, but Liz appeared to be unconscious at the time.

*Lewis J. Stadlen and John Pleshette as Dr. Ira Fried: he is a player in the Soprano family&#x27;s executive game – a high-stakes poker tournament. He is a urologist who specializes in treating erectile dysfunction with penile implants. In 2002 Dr. Fried acted as the initial property buyer in Tony&#x27;s HUD scam using $500,000 of Soprano family money to buy several homes on Garside Street in Mount Pleasant, Newark, New Jersey and on Frelinghuysen Ave in Weequahic, Newark for $25,000 each which would then be falsely appraised at $200,000. He would then sell the properties on to Maurice Tiffen who would claim the project a financial failure and the loan would be approved through Maurice&#x27;s organization. In 2004, Fried and numerous others were the victims of a large-scale car robbery at his daughter&#x27;s wedding in Ringwood, New Jersey and sold them to a chop shop in Newburg, New York that worked with Johnny Sack instead of using Tony&#x27;s connections in Brookdale, New Jersey. He reached out to Tony about the theft. It turned out that Feech La Manna had organized the car theft scheme.

*Matthew Sussman as Dr. Douglas Schreck: he is Junior Soprano&#x27;s cardiologist at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, who allowed Junior to use his office to conduct meetings while under the pretense of coming in for medical appointments due to the physician-patient privilege clause that denies the FBI and authorities to listening in on their conversations, meeting with associates including Tony and Richie Aprile.

*Michael Countryman as Dr. Richard Vogel: he is a psychotherapist whom A.J.&#x27;s pediatrician recommends to Carmela for therapy concerning A.J.&#x27;s depression. In the episode &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, Dr. Vogel also enters A.J. into a mental hospital and arranges a group therapy session with him and his parents after A.J. tries to commit suicide.

*Will McCormack as Jason LaPenna: he is Jennifer Melfi and Richard LaPenna&#x27;s son.

*Richard Romanus as Richard LaPenna: he is the estranged Calabrese husband of Jennifer Melfi and father of Jason LaPenna. When Dr. Melfi&#x27;s family learns that she is treating a major mob figure, they urge her to end the association. Richard is a member of an organization that aims to combat the negative portrayal of Italian Americans as Mafia figures in the media. Richard and Jennifer had reconciled in 2001 and he was living with her at the time of her rape. He originally thinks Jennifer&#x27;s rapist is Puerto Rican–based on her description, but later finds out that he bears an Italian surname (Rossi) and is personally offended. He was very angry when mishandling of the chain of custody allowed the man to go free.

*Cara Buono as Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti: she was Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s new girlfriend in 2006. She became pregnant and planned to terminate the pregnancy, blaming herself for the lack of contraception. When she told Chris, he suggested they marry in Atlantic City. Soon after their marriage, Kelli and Chris bought a large new home. Christopher&#x27;s interest in Kelli began to drift and he began an affair with Julianna Skiff. Kelli remained devoted to Christopher and did not complain about his long absences. In 2007, Kelli gave birth to a daughter, Caitlyn. She and Christopher later attended Caitlyn&#x27;s baptism, at which Tony and Carmela Soprano became Caitlin&#x27;s godparents. In the episode &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;, Kelli was terrorized by Paulie Gualtieri when Paulie drove his Cadillac CTS through their front yard in retaliation for Christopher throwing Paulie&#x27;s nephew Little Paulie Germani out a window. Little Paulie had stolen merchandise from Kelli&#x27;s father&#x27;s hardware store on at least two occasions.

<text>Clarence Albert Poindexter (May 4, 1905 – January 28, 1984), known best as Al Dexter, was an American country musician and songwriter. 

He is best known today for his most popular song, &quot;Pistol Packin&#x27; Mama&quot;, a 1943 hit which was one of the most popular recordings of the World War II years, and later became a hit again with a cover by Bing Crosby, as well as the Andrews Sisters.

==Biography==
Born in Jacksonville, Texas, United States, Dexter owned a bar in the 1930s and helped popularize the style of country music known as honky tonk. He made his recording debut on November 28, 1936, for ARC Records. and was probably the first artist to ever use the term &quot;honky tonk&quot; in a country song when he recorded &quot;Honky Tonk Blues&quot; at his first session. 

His self-penned hit, &quot;Pistol Packin&#x27; Mama&quot;, became the 1943 marching chorus of the New York Yankees. The 1943 movie of the same name, made by the Republic Pictures, gave Dexter close to $250,000 in royalties. Another hit from the 1940s was &quot;Guitar Polka&quot;, which entered &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; list as the &quot;Most Played Juke Box Folk Record&quot; for 16 weeks running in 1946. Other hits include &quot;So Long Pal&quot;, &quot;Triflin&#x27; Gal&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Losing My Mind Over You&quot; and &quot;Too Late to Worry, Too Blue to Cry.&quot;

Dexter was the first country singer to perform on Broadway, and in 1971, was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. 

He died on January 28, 1984, in Lewisville, Texas.

On August 21, 2010, Dexter was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall Of Fame, located in Carthage, Texas. Other inductees that night were George Jones along with composer Ray Winkler.

Following Al Dexter&#x27;s death in 1984, his family discovered 50 master tapes containing studio recordings. In 2010, Al Dexter&#x27;s son, Carl Wayne Poindexter, released the three-disc CD box set entitled &quot;Al Dexter&#x27;s Found Masters Volume 1–3&quot; on his independent record label, Al Dexter Estate Productions. This professionally produced collection contained digitally re-mastered studio recordings which were made by Dexter with various band line-ups and configurations.

<doc id="515811" wikidata="Q385870" url="?curid=515811" title="Flea market">
<text>A flea market (or swap meet) is a type of street market that provides space for vendors to sell previously owned (second-hand) goods. This type of market is often seasonal. However, in recent years there has been the development of &#x27;formal&#x27; and &#x27;casual&#x27; markets which divides a fixed-style market (formal) with long-term leases and a seasonal-style market with short-term leases. Consistently, there tends to be an emphasis on sustainable consumption whereby items such as used goods, collectibles, antiques and vintage clothing can be purchased, in an effort to combat climate change and fast fashion.

Flea market vending is distinguished from street vending in that the market alone, and not any other public attraction, brings in buyers. There are a variety of vendors: some part-time who consider their work at flea markets a hobby due to their possession of an alternative job; full-time vendors who dedicate all their time to their stalls and collection of merchandise and rely solely on the profits made at the market. Vendors require skill in following retro and vintage trends, as well as selecting merchandise which connects with the culture and identity of their customers.

In the United States, the National Association of Flea Markets was established in 1998, which provides various resources for sellers, suppliers and buyers and also provides a means for suppliers and sellers to communicate and form affiliations.

== Origin of the term ==
While the concept has existed for millennia, the origins of the term &quot;flea market&quot; are disputed. According to one hypothesis, the Fly Market in 18th-century New York City, located at Maiden Lane near the East River in Manhattan, began the association. The land on which the market took place was originally a salt marsh with a brook, and by the early 1800s, the Fly Market was the city&#x27;s principal market.

A second hypothesis maintains that &quot;flea market&quot; is a common English calque from the French &quot;marché aux puces&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;market with fleas&quot;, labelled as such because the items sold were previously owned and worn, likely containing fleas. The first reference to this term appeared in two conflicting stories about a location in Paris in the 1860s which was known as the &quot;marché aux puces&quot;.

The traditional and most-publicized story is in the article &quot;What Is a Flea Market?&quot; by Albert LaFarge in the 1998 winter edition of &quot;Today&#x27;s Flea Market&quot; magazine: 

The second story appeared in the book &quot;Flea Markets&quot;, published in Europe by Chartwell Books, reading in its introduction:
==Regional names==
In the United States, an outdoor swap meet is the equivalent of a flea market. However, an indoor swap meet is the equivalent of a bazaar, a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed booths or storefronts for the vendors.

Different English-speaking countries use various names for flea markets. In Australian English, they are also called &#x27;trash and treasure markets&#x27;, while the term &#x27;swap meet&#x27; is used for a market held primarily to sell car- and motorcycle parts and automobilia. In Philippine English, the word is &quot;tianggê&quot; from the word &quot;tianguis&quot; via Mexican Spanish coming from Nahuatl. Despite common misconception, it is not derived from Hokkien. The word supplants the indigenous term &quot;talipapâ&quot;. In India, it is known as &quot;gurjari&quot; or &quot;shrukawadi bazaar&quot; or even as &quot;juna bazaar&quot; in Pune.

In the United Kingdom, they are known as car boot sales if the event takes place in a field or car park, as the vendors will sell goods from the boot (or &#x27;trunk&#x27; in American English) of their car. If the event is held indoors, such as a school or church hall, then it is usually known as either a jumble sale, or a bring and buy sale. In Quebec and France, they are often called &quot;Marché aux puces&quot; (literally &quot;flea market&quot;), while in French-speaking areas of Belgium, the name &quot;brocante&quot; or &quot;vide-grenier&quot; is normally used.

In German, there are many words in use but the most common word is &quot;Flohmarkt&quot;, meaning literally &quot;flea market&quot;. The same applies to Dutch &quot;vlooienmarkt&quot;, Swedish &quot;loppmarknad&quot; and Finnish &quot;kirpputori&quot;. In the predominantly Cuban/Hispanic areas of South Florida, they are called &quot;[el] pulguero&quot; (&quot;[the] flea store&quot;) from &quot;pulga&quot;, the Spanish word for fleas. In the Southern part of Andalusia, due to the influence of Gibraltar English, they are known as &quot;piojito&quot;, which means &quot;little louse&quot;. In Chile they can be called &quot;persas&quot; or &quot;mercados persa&quot; (&quot;persian market&quot;) and &quot;ferias libres&quot;, if mostly selling fruit and vegetables. In Argentina they are most likely called &quot;feria artesanal&quot; (artisan&#x27;s or street fair) or &quot;feria americana&quot; (American fair), the latter name is due to have taken the idea from their United States counterpart.

In Moroccan Darija, the term for &quot;flea market&quot; is &quot;juṭiyya&quot;, which either derives from French or (throwable), or is an older term derived from &quot;juqa&quot; meaning &quot;gathering of people&quot;. An ancient village on the bank of Sebou River by the name &quot;Juta&quot; may have been a big medieval market.

In the Philippines &quot;Tiangges&quot; or bazaar shopping is famous in spacious markets like Divisoria, Greenhills, and Baclaran. It features rows of stalls with displays for sale of variety items like clothes, accessories, gadgets at incredibly low prices.

<text>Dumbek rhythms are a collection of rhythms that are usually played with hand drums such as the dumbek. These rhythms are various combinations of these three basic sounds:

*Doom (D), produced with the dominant hand striking the sweet spot of the skin.
*Tak (T), produced with the recessive hand striking the rim.
*Ka (K), produced with the dominant hand striking the rim.

==Notation==

In a simple notation, these three sounds are represented by three letters: D, T, and K. When capitalized, the beat is emphasized, and when lower-case, it is played less emphatically. These basic sounds can be combined with other sounds:

*Sak or slap (S) (sometimes called &#x27;pa&#x27;), produced with the dominant hand. Similar to the doom except the fingers are cupped to capture the air, making a loud terminating sound. The hand remains on the drum head to prevent sustain.
*Trill (l), produced by lightly tapping three fingers of one hand in rapid succession on the rim
*Roll or (rash, r), produced by a rapid alternating pattern of taks and kas

This is the simple dumbek rhythm notation for the 2/4 rhythm known as &quot;ayyoub&quot;:
==Rhythms==
There are many traditional rhythms. Some are much more popular than others. The &quot;big six&quot; Middle Eastern rhythms are Ayyoub, Beledi (Masmoudi Saghir), Chiftitelli, Maqsoum, Masmoudi and Saidi.

<text>Allen Richard Toussaint (; January 14, 1938 – November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger, and record producer. He was an influential figure in New Orleans rhythm and blues from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as &quot;one of popular music&#x27;s great backroom figures.&quot; Many musicians recorded Toussaint&#x27;s compositions. He was a producer for hundreds of recordings: the best known are &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, by longtime friend Dr. John, and &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; by Labelle.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
The youngest of three children, Toussaint was born in 1938 in New Orleans and grew up in a shotgun house in the Gert Town neighborhood, where his mother, Naomi Neville (whose name he later adopted pseudonymously for some of his works), welcomed and fed all manner of musicians as they practiced and recorded with her son. His father, Clarence, worked on the railway and played trumpet. Allen Toussaint learned piano as a child and took informal music lessons from an elderly neighbor, Ernest Pinn. In his teens he played in a band, the Flamingos, with the guitarist Snooks Eaglin, before dropping out of school. A significant early influence on Toussaint was the syncopated &quot;second-line&quot; piano style of Professor Longhair. Toussaint was raised Catholic.

After a lucky break at age 17, in which he stood in for Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith at a performance with Earl King&#x27;s band in Prichard, Alabama, Toussaint was introduced to a group of local musicians led by Dave Bartholomew, who performed regularly at the Dew Drop Inn, a nightclub on Lasalle Street in Uptown New Orleans. His first recording was in 1957 as a stand-in for Fats Domino on Domino&#x27;s record &quot;I Want You to Know&quot;, on which Toussaint played piano and Domino overdubbed his vocals. His first success as a producer came in 1957 with Lee Allen&#x27;s &quot;Walking with Mr. Lee&quot;. He began performing regularly in Bartholomew&#x27;s band, and he recorded with Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, Lee Allen and other leading New Orleans performers.

After being spotted as a sideman by the A&amp;R man Danny Kessler, he initially recorded for RCA Records as Al Tousan. In early 1958 he recorded an album of instrumentals, &quot;The Wild Sound of New Orleans&quot;, with a band including Alvin &quot;Red&quot; Tyler (baritone sax), either Nat Perrilliat or Lee Allen (tenor sax), either Justin Adams or Roy Montrell (guitar), Frank Fields (bass), and Charles &quot;Hungry&quot; Williams (drums). The recordings included Toussaint and Tyler&#x27;s composition &quot;Java&quot;, which first charted for Floyd Cramer in 1962 and became a number 4 pop hit for Al Hirt (also on RCA) in 1964. Toussaint recorded and co-wrote songs with Allen Orange in the early 1960s.

===Success in the 1960s===

====Minit and Instant Records====

In 1960, Joe Banashak, of Minit Records and later Instant Records, hired Toussaint as an A&amp;R man and record producer. He did freelance work for other labels, such as Fury. Toussaint played piano, wrote, arranged and produced a string of hits in the early and mid-1960s for New Orleans R&amp;B artists such as Ernie K-Doe, Chris Kenner, Irma Thomas (including &quot;It&#x27;s Raining&quot;), Art and Aaron Neville, The Showmen, and Lee Dorsey, whose first hit &quot;Ya Ya&quot; he produced in 1961.

The early to mid-1960s are regarded as Toussaint&#x27;s most creatively successful period. Notable examples of his work are Jessie Hill&#x27;s &quot;Ooh Poo Pah Doo&quot; (written by Hill and arranged and produced by Toussaint), Ernie K-Doe&#x27;s &quot;Mother-in-Law&quot;, and Chris Kenner&#x27;s &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ankeny (Ooh/Jess. Hill)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A two-sided 1962 hit by Benny Spellman comprised &quot;Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)&quot; (covered by The O&#x27;Jays, Ringo Starr, and Alex Chilton) and the simple but effective &quot;Fortune Teller&quot; (covered by various 1960s rock groups, including The Rolling Stones, The Nashville Teens, The Who, The Hollies, The Throb, and The Searchers founder Tony Jackson).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton (O&#x27; Jays/Lispstick)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marks and McIntyre (Fort. Tell./Throb&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Ruler of My Heart&quot;, written under his pseudonym Naomi Neville, first recorded by Irma Thomas for the Minit label in 1963, was adapted by Otis Redding under the title &quot;Pain in My Heart&quot; later that year, prompting Toussaint to file a lawsuit against Redding and his record company, Stax (the claim was settled out of court, with Stax agreeing to credit Naomi Neville as the songwriter). Redding&#x27;s version of the song was also recorded by The Rolling Stones on their second album and was in the Grateful Dead&#x27;s early repertoire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger (Ruler/Irma)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, &quot;A Certain Girl&quot; (originally by Ernie K-Doe) was the B-side of the first single release by The Yardbirds. The song was released again in 1980 by Warren Zevon, as the single from the album &quot;Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School&quot;; it reached 57 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. Mary Weiss, former lead singer of The Shangri-Las, released it as &quot;A Certain Guy&quot; in 2007. Linda Ronstadt released a jazzy version of &quot;Ruler of my Heart&quot; in 1998 on &quot;We Ran&quot;.

Toussaint credited about twenty songs to his parents, Clarence and Naomi, sometimes using the pseudonym &quot;Naomi Neville&quot;. These include &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;, first recorded by Benny Spellman in 1961, &quot;Pain In My Heart,&quot; first a hit for Otis Redding in 1963, and &quot;Work, Work, Work&quot;, recorded by The Artwoods in 1966. Alison Krauss and Robert Plant covered &quot;Fortune Teller&quot; on their 2007 album &quot;Raising Sand&quot;.

====Sansu: Soul and early New Orleans funk====
Toussaint was drafted into the United States Army in 1963 but continued to record when on leave. After his discharge in 1965, he joined forces with Marshall Sehorn&lt;ref name=&quot;Ankeny (Toussaint/Seahorn)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to form Sansu Enterprises, which included a record label, Sansu, variously known as Tou-Sea, Deesu, or Kansu, and recorded Lee Dorsey, Chris Kenner, Betty Harris, and others. Dorsey had hits with several of Toussaint&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Ride Your Pony&quot; (1965), &quot;Working in the Coal Mine&quot; (1966), and &quot;Holy Cow&quot; (1966). The core players of the rhythm section used on many of the Sansu recordings from the mid- to late 1960s, Art Neville and the Sounds, consisted of Art Neville on keyboards, Leo Nocentelli on guitar, George Porter Jr on bass, and Zigaboo Modeliste on drums. They later became known as The Meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulane (Toussaint/Sansu/Meters)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their backing can be heard in songs such as Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;Ride Your Pony&quot; and &quot;Working in the Coal Mine&quot;, sometimes augmented by horns, which were usually arranged by Toussaint. The Toussaint-produced records of these years backed by the members of the Meters, with their increasing use of syncopation and electric instrumentation, built on the influences of Professor Longhair and others before them, but updated these strands, effectively paving the way for the development of a modern New Orleans funk sound.
===1970s to 1990s===
Toussaint continued to produce The Meters when they began releasing records under their own name in 1969. As part of a process begun at Sansu and reaching fruition in the 1970s, he developed a funkier sound, writing and producing for a host of artists, such as Dr. John (backed by the Meters, on the 1973 album &quot;In the Right Place&quot;, which contained the hit &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;) and an album by The Wild Tchoupitoulas, a New Orleans Mardi Gras Indians tribe led by &quot;Big Chief Jolly&quot; (George Landry) (backed by the Meters and several of his nephews, including Art and Cyril Neville of the Meters and their brothers Charles and Aaron, who later performed and recorded as The Neville Brothers).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chrispell (Dr. John/Toussaint)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christgau (Wild Tchop./Toussaint)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Toussaint began to work with artists from beyond New Orleans artists, such as B. J. Thomas, Robert Palmer, Willy DeVille, Sandy Denny, Elkie Brooks, Solomon Burke, Scottish soul singer Frankie Miller (&quot;High Life&quot;), and southern rocker Mylon LeFevre. He arranged horn music for The Band&#x27;s albums &quot;Cahoots&quot; (1971) and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (1972), as well as for the documentary film &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1978).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlmann (Cahoots/Band/Tous.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlmann (Moondog/Band/Tous.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deming (Last Waltz/Band/Tous.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Boz Scaggs recorded Toussaint&#x27;s &quot;What Do You Want the Girl to Do?&quot; on his 1976 album &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;, which reached number 2 on the U.S. pop albums chart. The song was also recorded by Bonnie Raitt for her 1975 album &quot;Home Plate&quot; and by Geoff Muldaur (1976), Lowell George (1979), Vince Gill (1993), and Elvis Costello (2005). In 1976 he collaborated with John Mayall on the album &quot;Notice to Appear&quot;.

In 1973 Toussaint and Sehorn created the Sea-Saint recording studio in the Gentilly section of eastern New Orleans. Toussaint began recording under his own name, contributing vocals as well as piano. His solo career peaked in the mid-1970s with the albums &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot; and &quot;Southern Nights&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planer (Whisper/Toussaint)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine (South. Nights/Tousssaint)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he teamed with Labelle and produced their acclaimed 1975 album &quot;Nightbirds&quot;, which contained the number one hit &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. The same year, Toussaint collaborated with Paul McCartney and Wings for their hit album &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; and played on the song &quot;Rock Show&quot;. In 1973, his &quot;Yes We Can Can&quot; was covered by The Pointer Sisters for their self-titled debut album; released as a single, it became both a pop and R&amp;B hit and served as the group&#x27;s introduction to popular culture. Two years later, Glen Campbell covered Toussaint&#x27;s &quot;Southern Nights&quot; and carried the song to number one on the pop, country, and adult contemporary charts. Toussaint&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ll Take A Melody&quot; figured permanently in the repertoire of the Jerry Garcia Band.

In 1987, he was the musical director of an off-Broadway show, &quot;Staggerlee&quot;, with a score composed of songs from his catalog, which ran for 150 performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milward (Stagerlee/Tous.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of his contemporaries, Toussaint found that interest in his compositions was rekindled when his work began to be sampled by hip hop artists in the 1980s and 1990s.

===2000s===

Most of Toussaint&#x27;s possessions, including his home and recording studio, Sea-Saint Studios, were lost during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baer (Katrina/Tous.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He initially sought shelter at the Astor Crowne Plaza Hotel on Canal Street. Following the hurricane, whose aftermath left most of the city flooded, he left New Orleans for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and for several years settled in New York City. His first television appearance after the hurricane was on the September 7, 2005, episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, sitting in with Paul Shaffer and his CBS Orchestra. Toussaint performed regularly at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City through 2009. He eventually returned to New Orleans and lived there for the rest of his life.

Toussaint is interviewed on screen, served as a musical director, led his band and appears in performance footage in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Make It Funky!&quot;, which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. In the film, he performed a medley of his compositions &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;, &quot;Working in the Coal Mine&quot; and &quot;A Certain Girl&quot;. He also performed &quot;Tipitina&quot; in a piano duo with Jon Cleary, and accompanied Irma Thomas on &quot;Old Records&quot;, Lloyd Price on &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, and Bonnie Raitt on &quot;What is Success&quot;.

&quot;The River in Reverse&quot;, Toussaint&#x27;s collaborative album with Elvis Costello, was released on May 29, 2006, in the UK on Verve Records by Universal Classics and Jazz UCJ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine (Toussaint/Costello)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded in Hollywood and at the Piety Street Studio in the Bywater, as the first major studio session to take place after Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, Toussaint performed a duet with Paul McCartney of a song by New Orleans musician and resident Fats Domino, &quot;I Want to Walk You Home&quot;, as their contribution to &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; on Vanguard.

In 2008, Toussaint&#x27;s song &quot;Sweet Touch of Love&quot; was used in a deodorant commercial for the Axe (Lynx) brand. The commercial won a Gold Lion at the 2008 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. In February 2008, Toussaint appeared on &quot;Le Show&quot;, the Harry Shearer show broadcast on KCRW. He appeared in London in August 2008, where he performed at the Roundhouse. In October 2008 he performed at Festival New Orleans at The O2 alongside acts such as Dr. John and Buckwheat Zydeco. Sponsored by Quint Davis of the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and Philip Anschutz, the event was intended to promote New Orleans music and culture and to revive the once lucrative tourist trade that had been almost completely lost following the flooding that came with Hurricane Katrina. After his second performance at the festival, Toussaint appeared alongside Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu.

Toussaint performed instrumentals from his album &quot;The Bright Mississippi&quot; and many of his older songs for a taping of the PBS series &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, which aired on January 9, 2015. In December 2009, he was featured on Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Spectacle&quot; program on the Sundance Channel, singing &quot;A Certain Girl&quot;. Toussaint appeared on Eric Clapton&#x27;s 2010 album, &quot;Clapton&quot;, in two Fats Waller covers, &quot;My Very Good Friend the Milkman&quot; and &quot;When Somebody Thinks You&#x27;re Wonderful&quot;.

His late-blooming career as a performer began when he accepted an offer to play a regular Sunday brunch session at an East Village pub. Interviewed in 2014 by &quot;The Guardian&quot;s Richard Williams, Toussaint said, &quot;I never thought of myself as a performer... My comfort zone is behind the scenes.&quot; In 2013 he collaborated on a ballet with the choreographer Twyla Tharp. Toussaint was a musical mentor to Swedish-born New Orleans songwriter and performer Theresa Andersson. Toussaint&#x27;s two marriages ended in divorce.

==Death==
Toussaint died in the early hours of November 10, 2015, in Madrid, Spain, while on tour. Following a concert at the Teatro Lara on Calle Corredera Baja de San Pablo, he had a heart attack at his hotel and was pronounced dead on his arrival at the hospital. He was 77. He had been due to perform a sold-out concert at the EFG London Jazz Festival at The Barbican on November 15 with his band and Theo Croker. He was also scheduled to play with Paul Simon at a benefit concert in New Orleans on December 8. His final recording, &quot;American Tunes&quot;, titled after the Paul Simon song, which he sings on the album, was released by Nonesuch Records on June 10, 2016.

He was survived by his three children, Clarence (better known as Reginald), Naomi, and Alison, and several grandchildren. His children had managed his career in his last years.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ben Sisario quoted Quint Davis, producer of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival: &quot;In the pantheon of New Orleans music people, from Jelly Roll Morton to Mahalia Jackson to Fats—that&#x27;s the place where Allen Toussaint is...&quot; Paul Simon said, &quot;We were friends and colleagues for almost 40 years... We played together at the New Orleans jazz festival. We played the benefits for Katrina relief. We were about to perform together on December 8. I was just beginning to think about it; now I&#x27;ll have to think about his memorial. I am so sad.&quot;

The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; described Toussaint as &quot;a master of New Orleans soul and R&amp;B, and one of America&#x27;s most successful songwriters and producers,&quot; adding that &quot;self-effacing Toussaint played a crucial role in countless classic songs popularised by other artists.&quot; He had written so many songs, over more than five decades, that he admitted to forgetting quite a few.

<doc id="515818" wikidata="Q1570092" url="?curid=515818" title="Hal Blaine">
<text>Hal Blaine (born Harold Simon Belsky; February 5, 1929 – March 11, 2019) was an American drummer and session musician, thought to be among the most recorded studio drummers in the music industry, claiming over 35,000 sessions and 6,000 singles. His drumming is featured on 150 US top 10 hits, 40 of which went to number one.

Born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Blaine moved with his family to California in 1943 and began playing jazz and big band music before taking up rock and roll session work. He became one of the regulars in Phil Spector&#x27;s de facto house band, which Blaine nicknamed &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;. Some of the records Blaine played on include the Ronettes&#x27; single &quot;Be My Baby&quot; (1963), which contained a drum beat that became widely imitated, as well as works by popular artists such as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, the Carpenters, Neil Diamond, and the Byrds.

Blaine&#x27;s workload declined in the 1980s as recording and musical practices changed. In 2000, he was among the inaugural &quot;sidemen&quot; inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2007 he was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum as a member of the Wrecking Crew and in 2018 he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Life and career==
Blaine was born Harold Simon Belsky to Jewish Eastern European immigrants, Meyer and Rose Belsky (&quot;&quot; Silverman), in Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States. When he was seven, he moved with his family to Hartford, Connecticut. He began playing drums at the age of eight, and again moved with his family to California in 1943.

From 1949 to 1952, Blaine learned drums from Roy Knapp, who had also taught jazz drummer Gene Krupa. He began his professional career playing overnight sessions in Chicago strip clubs, which allowed him to practice and perfect his sight reading skills. He subsequently played as part of Count Basie&#x27;s big band and toured with Patti Page and Tommy Sands before taking up session work. Unlike many of his jazz contemporaries, Blaine enjoyed playing rock and roll and this meant he played on numerous such sessions during the 1950s. Blaine rarely performed live, with the exception of working with Nancy Sinatra at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in the 1960s, and with John Denver&#x27;s band in the 70s.

Blaine was a core member of the Wrecking Crew, the close-knit group of Los Angeles session musicians that played on hit records during the 1960s. Blaine claimed to have invented the name as the &quot;old-school&quot; studio musicians feared these new, younger guys were a &quot;destructive force&quot; in the conservative studio environment of the time.

Blaine played with guitarists Glen Campbell and Tommy Tedesco, bassists Carol Kaye and Joe Osborn, and keyboardists Leon Russell and Don Randi. 

Blaine played less session work from the 1980s onwards as computers and electronics began to be used in studios, and producers began to bring in younger players. The popularity of the drum machine also reduced demand for session drummers like Blaine. He kept busy recording advertising jingles for a number of years, before semi-retiring from performing. He lost most of his wealth following a divorce. At one point, he was working as a security guard in Arizona.

==Death==
Blaine died of natural causes on March 11, 2019, at age 90 in Palm Desert, California. A statement from his family read &quot;May he rest forever on 2 and 4&quot;, referring to the second and fourth beats of a measure in music. Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson expressed public condolences and praised Blaine&#x27;s musicianship. Ronnie Spector praised Blaine for &quot;the magic he put on all our Ronettes recordings&quot;.

==Legacy and recognition==
Blaine was a prolific session player and by his estimation played on over 35,000 recordings, including 6,000 singles. He is widely regarded as one of the most in-demand drummers in rock and roll history, having &quot;certainly played on more hit records than any drummer in the rock era&quot;. His drumming can be heard as part of the Wall of Sound on the Ronettes&#x27; 1963 single &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, produced by Phil Spector at Hollywood&#x27;s Gold Star Studios. Bruce Gary, drummer for the Knack, once said he was disappointed to find that his 10 favorite drummers turned out to all be Hal Blaine. Drummer Max Weinberg wrote, &quot;If Hal Blaine had played drums only on ... &#x27;Be My Baby&#x27;, his name would still be uttered with reverence and respect for the power of his big beat.&quot; The pattern was created when Blaine accidentally hit the snare on just the fourth beat, instead of the two and four. It was a mistake that Spector decided to leave in.

Blaine is also credited with popularising the &quot;disco beat&quot; after he recorded a &quot;pshh-shup&quot; sound by opening and closing the hi-hat at appropriate intervals on Johnny Rivers&#x27; &quot;Poor Side of Town&quot;. The effect had been widely used in jazz, but professional recording engineers disliked it because of its resemblance to white noise. The sound subsequently became sought-after by producers in the 1970s.
&quot;Hal Blaine Strikes Again&quot; was a rubber stamp used by Blaine to mark music scores and places where he played. When asked to explain about the stamp, Blaine said, &quot;I always stamp my charts. And there&#x27;s a reason why I started that; it wasn&#x27;t all ego.&quot; The stamp was used for any piece of music Blaine played on. Another drummer, Mike Botts, then with the band Bread, recalled: &quot;Every studio I went to in the late sixties, there was a rubber stamp imprint on the wall of the drum booth that said, &#x27;Hal Blaine strikes again.&#x27; Hal was getting so many studio dates he actually had a rubber stamp made. He was everywhere!&quot;

In 2014, Blaine was portrayed by Johnny Sneed in the film &quot;Love &amp; Mercy&quot;, a biopic of the Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson.

The instrumental song &quot;Hal McBlaine&quot; – a portmanteau combining the names of Blaine and guitarist John McBain – by psychedelic garage rock band Wellwater Conspiracy on their 1999 album &quot;Brotherhood of Electric: Operational Directives&quot; is an homage to Blaine.

<text>Meredith Ann Brooks (born June 12, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. A member of the Oregon music scene, she received international acclaim with her solo album &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; (1997) and its single, &quot;Bitch&quot;, which reached the top 10 in many countries and earned her a Grammy Award nomination.

== Career ==
Brooks started her music career in 1976 as a member of an all-female band called Sapphire, based in Eugene, Oregon, touring and recording with CMS Records in the Pacific Northwest. Her bandmates were Janis Gaines, Cynthia Larsen, Patricia French and Pam Johnson. Seeking greater success, Brooks pushed the band to move to Seattle without Gaines on keyboards, reducing Sapphire to a foursome. In Seattle, Sapphire recorded at Kaye-Smith Studios at the same time as Heart. When this version of the band split in 1982, Brooks moved to Los Angeles to develop a solo career, releasing an album titled &quot;Meredith Brooks&quot; in 1986, which saw limited success in Mexico. In 1987, she joined Charlotte Caffey and Gia Ciambotti to form the trio the Graces, releasing the single &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot; which rose to number 56 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s charts. The Graces subsequently released an album, &quot;Perfect View&quot;, and three more singles, but these did not chart, and the Graces were dropped from the A&amp;M label in 1991.

In 1995, Brooks landed a solo contract with Capitol Records. After two years, her first single, &quot;Bitch&quot;, was released, and she was nominated twice for the 1998 Grammy Awards, for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song. The single went Platinum in Australia.

Her album &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; achieved Platinum sales, peaking at 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 5 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was produced by David Ricketts, formerly of David and David, and he also played keyboards (among other instruments) on the album. Brooks toured in the US and Europe in 1997 and 1998 to support the album, and also participated in the Lilith Fair music festival tour in both of those years.

On March 29, 1998, in Argentina, she opened for the Rolling Stones. During her set the crowd demanded the Stones and became violent, throwing objects including rocks and tampons at the stage and bruising her eye. She appeared again the next day wearing an Argentine football shirt, but the crowd again threw things at her, so after singing &quot;Bitch&quot; she yelled to the crowd, threw the shirt on the ground and walked off.

In 1999, Brooks recorded her third album, &quot;Deconstruction.&quot; The track &quot;Sin City&quot; was recorded for the movie &quot;Snake Eyes.&quot;

In 2002, Brooks signed with independent label Gold Circle Records. She worked on her fourth album, &quot;Bad Bad One&quot;. The label folded immediately after releasing the album.

In 2002, she produced Jennifer Love Hewitt&#x27;s album &quot;BareNaked&quot; and appeared on VH1 &quot;Divas Las Vegas&quot; as a guest guitar soloist with Celine Dion and Anastacia.

Brooks signed a record deal with SLG Records and re-issued &quot;Bad Bad One&quot; as &quot;Shine&quot; in 2004. The track &quot;Shine&quot; was used as the theme music for &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; from 2004 to 2008. The instrumental remix appears as the last track on the album.

In 2007, Brooks completed a children&#x27;s album titled &quot;If I Could Be...&quot; She also began developing Portland-area Sony Music Entertainment artist Becca.

Brooks is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

In 2018, the song &quot;I&#x27;m a Mess&quot; was a worldwide chart hit for Bebe Rexha. While an original song, it does borrow some of its melody from Brooks&#x27; earlier hit &quot;Bitch&quot;. As a result, Meredith Brooks is listed as a co-writer of the song.

<doc id="515825" wikidata="Q1049580" url="?curid=515825" title="Tony Soprano">
<text>Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; John Soprano, portrayed by James Gandolfini, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the HBO crime drama television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He is a member of the Italian-American Mafia and, later in the series, acts as the boss of the fictional DiMeo crime family of North Jersey. The character was conceived by &quot;Sopranos&quot; creator and showrunner David Chase, who was also largely responsible for the character&#x27;s story arc throughout the series. 

Gandolfini was cast in the role ahead of other actors, including Steven Van Zandt and Michael Rispoli. The character is loosely based on stories from and about an assortment of real-life Mafia figures, including New Jersey mobsters Ruggerio &quot;Richie the Boot&quot; Boiardo, boss of the North Jersey faction of the Genovese crime family, and Vincent &quot;Vinny Ocean&quot; Palermo, a former &quot;caporegime&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; boss of the DeCavalcante crime family. Bobby Boriello and Mark Damiano II portrayed the character as a child in one episode each and Danny Petrillo played the character as a teenager in three episodes. William Ludwig portrayed him as a child and Gandolfini&#x27;s son Michael portrayed him as a teenager in the 2021 prequel film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;.

In the first season, Tony is a capo and serves as a key ally for ailing acting boss Giacomo &quot;Jackie&quot; Aprile in the DiMeo family. Between the first and second seasons, he is promoted to acting underboss and then official underboss, a position he retains until the sixth season; his uncle Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano is the acting boss up until early in the sixth season, but actual power is retained by Tony. Throughout the series, Tony struggles to balance the conflicting needs of his familywife Carmela, daughter Meadow, son A.J. and mother Liviawith those of the Mafia. He displays behavior traits characteristic of a violent sociopath, struggles with depression and is prone to panic attacks. From the pilot episode, he seeks treatment from Dr. Jennifer Melfi (a character Chase modeled after his own psychiatrist) and remains in therapy on and off until the penultimate episode of the series.

Both the Tony Soprano character and Gandolfini&#x27;s performance garnered widespread critical acclaim, with Soprano often being cited as one of the greatest and most influential characters in television history. For his portrayal of the character, Gandolfini won three Emmy Awards for Best Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three Screen Actors Guild Awards for Best Male Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama and two additional SAG Awards for Best Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

==Casting==
James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film &quot;True Romance&quot;, ultimately receiving the role ahead of several other actors due to his physically large stature and acting abilities.

Anthony LaPaglia was initially interested in the role but, due to a Broadway production and the decision not to go with Fox, he was not considered further. Series creator David Chase invited Steven Van Zandt, a guitarist in Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, to audition for the role of Tony. Van Zandt, who had never acted before, felt that the role should go to an experienced actor, so Chase wrote him into a part that did not exist—as Silvio Dante. Michael Rispoli, who eventually played Jackie Aprile, was also very close to being cast as Tony.

In the pilot, Tony was named Tommy—an homage to the character played by James Cagney in &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, Tom Powers, but the clearance on naming the character Tom was never given. The name &quot;Tony Soprano&quot; came from a family friend of Chase&#x27;s named Toby Soprano.

As methods to focus anger into his performances, Gandolfini said he would deliberately hit himself on the head, stay up all night to evoke the desired reaction, drink several cups of coffee or walk around with a rock in his shoe.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Early life ===
Tony Soprano was born in 1959 (1955 in &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;) to Livia and Johnny Soprano. His father was a caporegime in the DiMeo crime family. Tony grew up living with his parents and two sisters, Janice and Barbara, in the old First Ward neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. Tony&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Corrado Soprano, was from Avellino, Italy, and immigrated to the United States in 1911. He was a master stonemason who helped to build a church in Tony&#x27;s old neighborhood.

In adulthood, Tony recalls how Johnny used Janice as a cover for attending meetings with criminal associates at a children&#x27;s amusement park, leading him to assume she was his father&#x27;s favorite child. In therapy, when asked to remember happy childhood memories about his mother, Tony struggles to come up with any; he later describes his mother as a cruel, joyless woman who wore his father down &quot;to a little nub&quot; and who seemed to delight in threatening her children.

Tony has a troubled relationship with Janice, due to her flighty and impulsive nature, which leads to her constantly relying on him for financial and emotional support. Their bond is further complicated in adulthood when she murders her boyfriend, Richie Aprile, one of Tony&#x27;s subordinates, for striking her during a domestic dispute, leading to her calling on Tony for assistance in disposing of his body.

In high school, Tony met his future wife, Carmela DeAngelis, and became friends with Artie Bucco and Davey Scatino. He was also close to his maternal cousin Tony Blundetto. Their mutual relatives called them Tony-Uncle-Al and Tony-Uncle-Johnny (after their fathers) to tell them apart, although Tony Soprano and his friends would take to calling Blundetto &quot;Tony B&quot;. The two Tonys spent summers at the farm of their uncle Pat Blundetto, a former DiMeo soldier allowed to retire from the Mafia due to chronic illness.

When they were in their early twenties, Tony Blundetto was arrested for his part in a hijacking; Tony Soprano was supposed to join him on the job but failed to appear because of a panic attack after an argument with his mother, which resulted in his blacking out and suffering a head injury. For years after, Tony Soprano claimed that he had sustained the injury during a mugging, a story he maintained to allay his guilt. As a young adult, he attended Seton Hall University for a semester and a half before dropping out to pursue a life of crime.

Tony was part of an unofficial crew of young criminals consisting of childhood friends Silvio Dante, Ralph Cifaretto and Giacomo &quot;Jackie&quot; Aprile, Sr. He and Jackie gained notoriety in the DiMeo family by robbing a card game run by Feech La Manna. Ralph was left out of the plan due to debilitating pain from a venereal disease, leading to a lifelong animosity between the two. Under the tutelage of his father&#x27;s friend Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri, Tony committed his first murder in 1982, killing a small-time bookie named Willie Overall. Following the murder, Paulie became Tony&#x27;s mentor in the Mafia, with Paulie eventually settling into a role as Tony&#x27;s own &quot;capo&quot;.

Johnny shepherded Tony through his ascendancy until his death in 1986 from emphysema. When he died, Johnny had risen to the level of &quot;capo&quot; of his crew, as had his older brother, Junior. Junior took over as Tony&#x27;s mentor, with parental figures Paulie and Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero passing their loyalty to Tony upon his father&#x27;s death, while Silvio joined the crew. Tony became acting &quot;capo&quot; of his father&#x27;s old crew, a position which eventually became permanent.

In 1995, Jackie became acting boss after Ercole &quot;Eckley&quot; DiMeo was sent to prison. The family was prosperous under Jackie&#x27;s rule until 1998 when he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. With Jackie&#x27;s death in mid-1998, a succession crisis between Tony and Junior reached a point where a war within the family appeared imminent. However, Tony brought a quick end to the conflict by endorsing Junior as the official boss of the family. Unbeknownst to Junior, Tony secretly struck a deal with the rest of the family to be the true boss, allowing Junior to believe that he is in power and act as a distraction for the FBI.

=== Narrated killings committed by Tony Soprano ===
Tony personally committed eight murders during the show. As a boss, he was responsible for the deaths of others killed on his orders. The eight known murders, all explicitly presented onscreen, were:

* Willie Overall, shot and killed by Tony to &quot;make his bones&quot; (become a made man) (1982, in &quot;Remember When&quot;).
* Fabian &quot;Febby&quot; Petrulio, strangled by Tony for ratting out members of Paulie and Pussy&#x27;s crew and joining the witness protection program (1999, in &quot;College&quot;).
* Chucky Signore, shot and killed by Tony for conspiring with Junior to kill him (1999, in &quot;I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano&quot;).
* Matthew Bevilaqua, killed by Tony and Big Pussy for attempting to kill Christopher Moltisanti (Tony&#x27;s protégé and cousin-in-law) (2000, in &quot;From Where to Eternity&quot;).
* Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero, executed by Tony, Silvio, and Paulie on a yacht, after they discovered that he was an FBI informant (2000, in &quot;Funhouse&quot;).
* Ralph Cifaretto, choked/bludgeoned to death in a fight over Ralph&#x27;s supposedly killing their prize-winning racehorse &quot;Pie-O-My&quot; for insurance money (2002, in &quot;Whoever Did This&quot;).
* Tony Blundetto, shot and killed by Tony with a shotgun for the unauthorized killings of Joe Peeps and Billy Leotardo, to spare him from being the subject of torture from Phil Leotardo in revenge for his brother&#x27;s death, as well as spare his crew from the threat of retaliation (2004, in &quot;All Due Respect&quot;).
* Christopher Moltisanti, suffocated by Tony, following a major car accident with Christopher as the driver and Tony as the passenger, Christopher revealed that he was still using drugs and was worried about going to the hospital (2007, in &quot;Kennedy and Heidi&quot;).

It is made clear that some of these murders leave Tony perplexed as to how to cope with the situation; most notably, after murdering Christopher Moltisanti, he feels a rush of relief for finally being rid of an associate whom he feels he can no longer trust. He has to &quot;show the sad face&quot; while the rest of the family grieves, but Tony reassures himself that Moltisanti&#x27;s murder was necessary, despite the hurt caused to the family.

The murder of Fabian &quot;Febby&quot; Petrulio in &quot;College&quot; is out of retaliation for Febby getting members of Tony&#x27;s crew sent to prison when he ratted them out to get immunity. Tony does this out of a feeling of justice since he has contempt for Febby getting away with it initially.

The murder of Big Pussy in &quot;Funhouse&quot; weighs heavily on Tony. He is at first tempted to spare his old friend and even seems to be in denial for quite a long time, but in the end, realizes his priorities. In the years to follow, Tony talks about this with Paulie and Silvio, who also participated in the murder, and all three have had haunting dreams of the murder of their friend.

Tony kills Ralph Cifaretto after their horse, Pie-O-My, dies amid suspicious circumstances in &quot;Whoever Did This&quot;. Tony tries to confront Ralph about the situation but, after some heated words, Tony loses control and murders Ralph following a violent fight. Though no solid proof was found that the fire killing Pie-O-My was arson, Tony is convinced Ralph did it. Once the latter openly disdains the death of the horse this triggers Tony&#x27;s outrage since Soprano has often shown a fondness for animals. It is also implied that this burst of rage could have been fueled by anger over Ralph&#x27;s brutal murder of stripper Tracee, considering Tony uttered &quot;She was a beautiful, innocent creature. What&#x27;d she ever do to you? You fucking killed her!&quot; which could apply to both the female horse and the young woman.

The murder of Matthew Bevilaqua is an act of revenge, which had to be carried out due to the fact that the failed murder attempt on Christopher was an attempt to topple Tony as the boss of the family. Tony takes pleasure in the murder because it was revenge for the attempted hit on a loved one. This murder was the closest Tony came to getting in trouble with the authorities, due to having been seen by a witness (who at first comes forward, but withdraws once he learns of the fact that Tony is a mafioso). In addition to his potential arrest, Tony was also uncomfortable about the murder due to Bevilaqua&#x27;s young age, and the fact that his dying words were &quot;mommy.&quot; This causes Tony to spend more quality time with his own son.

The murder of his cousin, Tony Blundetto (in &quot;All Due Respect&quot;), is solely to save him from a far worse death if he were to fall into Phil&#x27;s hands, and so that Tony does not lose his reputation as a boss (as well as sparing the other members of his crew from Phil&#x27;s threats of retaliation, thus preserving their loyalty).

The murder of his nephew, Christopher Moltisanti is not done out of mob-related necessity. Christopher had been addicted to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol for many years and had not conquered his addiction in rehab. While Moltisanti presents a threat to Tony&#x27;s life and the New Jersey Mob, it is ultimately an emotional reaction. Tony is about to call 911 following a motor vehicle accident. Christopher, who needs urgent medical attention, tells him that he would &quot;never pass the drug test&quot; and would therefore lose his driver&#x27;s license. He asks Tony to call for a taxi. Tony looks at the baby seat on the backseat of the SUV which had been destroyed by a tree branch, closes his phone, and suffocates Christopher by holding his nose shut so that he chokes to death on his blood. Tony does not plan to murder Christopher but sees the opportunity after the car accident. Tony is never suspected of this murder.

=== As a father ===
Tony lives in North Caldwell, New Jersey with his wife and two children: Meadow Soprano and Anthony (A.J.) Soprano. He also treats Christopher Moltisanti, his wife&#x27;s first cousin once removed, as a son in many ways.

Tony is often portrayed as a loving father—he attends his children&#x27;s sporting events regularly and does all he can to ensure they have luxuries and opportunities. He hopes that both his children will escape the life of crime he has led. Tony takes great pride in Meadow&#x27;s achievements. In Season 1, he is moved to tears by her performance at a choir recital. He often tells people about her aspiration to become a pediatrician.

He also sometimes alienates his children with his behavior. He has always tried to conceal his criminal life from them—something that Meadow saw through early on and A.J. also realizes with guidance from his sister.

Tony&#x27;s over-protectiveness of Meadow leads to feuds between them on several occasions. For example, her first boyfriend at college, Noah Tannenbaum, is of black and Jewish ancestry and Tony&#x27;s dislike of him leads him to try to drive him away. Meadow learns of her father&#x27;s actions and does not speak to him for several months, eventually reconciling at Christmas in 2001.

Meadow&#x27;s next boyfriend is Jackie Aprile Jr., the son of Tony&#x27;s old friend, the late Jackie Aprile Sr. Tony had promised Jackie Jr.&#x27;s father that he would keep his son out of the Mafia life. Tony is initially pleased with the relationship, believing Jackie to be a hard-working pre-med student from a good family. However, since Jackie&#x27;s uncle Richie Aprile&#x27;s release from prison and subsequent death, Tony realizes that Jackie had become more involved in the Mafia when he sees him at strip clubs and a casino.

He eventually beats Jackie up to warn him about abusing his daughter&#x27;s feelings and confiscates his gun. Tony begins seeing much of himself and his treatment of Carmela in Jackie&#x27;s relationship with Meadow. Jackie is killed by Vito for his involvement in a robbery at Christopher&#x27;s and Furio&#x27;s executive card game, and for shooting a made man, Furio. This drives Meadow to drink and into depression, although they had broken up shortly before his death.

After Jackie&#x27;s death, Tony accepts Meadow&#x27;s college friends and gets along well with her fiancé, Finn, before the two separate under unrevealed circumstances.

When Meadow is out for dinner with her &quot;mystery&quot; boyfriend Patrick Parisi, New York mob member Salvatore &quot;Coco&quot; Cogliano walks up to the table and makes remarks about her looks and how &quot;Tony must love tucking you in at night&quot;. After taking advice from her mother, Meadow tells Tony, who hides his rage and says Coco is &quot;harmless&quot; and &quot;an idiot&quot;. Tony then tracks down Coco and Butch DeConcini at John&#x27;s Restaurant on East 12th Street in Manhattan. Tony viciously pistol-whips Coco several times with a snubnosed revolver and warns Butch at gunpoint to shut up and remain seated at his table. After breaking off some of Coco&#x27;s teeth with a curb stomp, Tony leaves the restaurant.

Tony&#x27;s feelings toward his son are mixed; he worries about his future. From the beginning, Tony has doubts that his son could succeed in the Mafia, telling his therapist, Dr. Melfi that &quot;he&#x27;d never make it&quot;. His fears are confirmed as A.J. consistently demonstrates throughout the series that he lacks his father&#x27;s cunning and dominating persona. Tony tells A.J. numerous times that he is proud that his son is gentle and kind. Tony is especially proud of A.J.&#x27;s prowess on the football field, even amid his failing grades in high school, but is frustrated with A.J.&#x27;s lack of focus after graduation.

After flunking out of Ramapo State, A.J. loafs around the house, parties, and for a time holds a job at Blockbuster until his father gets him a job working construction. There, A.J. meets Blanca, and in Tony&#x27;s opinion, A.J. does well until he and Blanca break up. Tony worries about A.J.&#x27;s depression, the &quot;rotten putrid Soprano gene&quot; that Tony believes he passed down to his son.

Hoping to get A.J. back on track, Tony rekindles A.J.&#x27;s friendship with &quot;the Jasons&quot;, sons of two of his associates, and A.J. seems to be doing better. With the help of a therapist and medication, A.J. is finally getting back to college, this time at Rutgers University, to take classes and party with girls as Tony believes every college kid should. This later turns sour after A.J. sees his new friends attack a Somali student on a bike and he regresses into depression.

A.J. tries to drown himself in a swimming pool but decides he wants to live; he is unable to escape the pool, however. Tony hears his cries for help and rescues him. After A.J. is released from a mental health ward, Tony and Carmela dissuade him from joining the Army and persuade him instead to become involved in a film bankrolled by Carmine Lupertazzi Jr., with the possibility of opening a club.

=== Interests and hobbies ===
Tony is an animal lover and enjoys feeding the ducks that visit his pool. He has a sentimental attachment towards animals, as he had been traumatized by the loss of his childhood dog (as revealed in the episode &quot;In Camelot&quot;), whose name was &quot;Tippy&quot;. When he goes to confront Angie Bonpensiero as she is walking her poodle, the dog greets Tony in a friendly manner, which Tony reciprocates. During Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s intervention, when Tony hears Christopher accidentally suffocated Adrianna&#x27;s dog, he is furious, saying, &quot;I oughta suffocate you, you little prick!&quot;.

He becomes involved in horse racing through his friend Hesh Rabkin, who owns a stable, and invests in a racehorse named Pie-O-My. When his horse is killed in a fire – possibly set by Ralph Cifaretto – Tony is deeply upset and saddened and kills Cifaretto, yelling: &quot;She was a beautiful innocent creature. What did she ever do to you?&quot; He repeats &quot;You fucking killed her!&quot;, while banging Cifaretto&#x27;s head against the floor.

When informed by Carmela that a black bear has been foraging in his home&#x27;s backyard while they were separated during Season 5, he reacts with interest, rather than fear. During his stay in the hospital after his shooting, he can be seen reading a book about dinosaurs, given by Carmela. In the series finale, Tony finds a stray cat at his safe house during the war with New York and takes a liking to it. He brings it back to Satriale&#x27;s, where it stares at the deceased Chris Moltisanti&#x27;s photo (much to Paulie&#x27;s dismay).

Tony is seen many times throughout the show engaging in both freshwater and saltwater angling. His son Anthony Jr. sometimes accompanies him on fishing outings. During the second season, he presents his son with a Fenwick rod and a Penn International reel, both extremely high-quality products. In the sixth season, while in Florida with Paulie, he rents a sport fishing boat. He is sometimes haunted by visions of Pussy Bonpensiero incarnated in the form of a fish – presumably a reference to the disposal of his body in the ocean, or perhaps a reference to &quot;sleeping with the fishes,&quot; from Godfather I. A Big Mouth Billy Bass novelty singing fish, brought into the Bada Bing by Georgie and another later presented to him as a Christmas present by his daughter Meadow, recalls his nightmare and disturbs him greatly.

Throughout the series, Tony is shown to be a frequent cigar smoker, as well as an occasional cigarette smoker. He can be seen smoking a cigar during important events, such as shortly before being told of his mother&#x27;s death and when disposing of Ralph Cifaretto&#x27;s corpse. In the Season 1 episode &quot;A Hit Is a Hit&quot;, he gives his doctor and next-door neighbor Bruce Cusamano a box of Cuban cigars as a thank-you gift for referring him to Dr. Melfi.

He is a gun enthusiast and is shown to have an arsenal in his home. He gives guns as birthday gifts to his father-in-law Hugh DeAngelis (in &quot;Marco Polo&quot;) and receives one from Bobby Baccialieri on his birthday (in &quot;Soprano Home Movies&quot;).

Tony enjoys sports, particularly baseball, football, basketball, golf, and horse racing. He played baseball and football at West Essex High School, and is a fan of the New York Yankees and New York Jets. He has taken A.J. to New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils games occasionally throughout the series. Some objects and posters in A.J.&#x27;s room confirm this. He plays golf with Johnny Sack at Upper Montclair Country Club. A large portion of his income is derived from illegal sports betting.

Tony is an amateur yachtsman and has owned two motor yachts throughout the show: &quot;Stugots&quot; and &quot;Stugots II&quot;, where several of his affairs take place. The name comes from the Italian phrase &quot;sto cazzo&quot;, literally meaning &quot;this dick&quot; or &quot;my dick&quot;, and depending on the context, &quot;what the fuck&quot; or &quot;my ass&quot;.

Tony maintains an avid interest in history, particularly World War II. Throughout seasons 4 and 5, Tony is seen watching Vietnam War documentaries. He is a big fan of President John F. Kennedy and owns one of his captain sailor hats, which he won at an auction. He is often shown watching programs on the History Channel about leaders such as George S. Patton, Erwin Rommel, and Winston Churchill. He reads &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu, which is quoted by several other characters on the show, particularly Paulie Walnuts.

Tony is often seen watching classic mob films. For example, he is shown watching &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (1931) throughout the episode &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot;, which addresses his mother&#x27;s death. He also shares a love for &quot;The Godfather&quot; series, wondering what went wrong in the third installment, although he and his friends are highly entertained when Silvio does an impression of Al Pacino from it.

Tony listens to classic, progressive rock and pop music, particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Over the course of the show he is seen to enjoy AC/DC, Deep Purple, Eagles, Eric Clapton, Jefferson Airplane, Jethro Tull, Journey, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Pink Floyd, Rush, Steely Dan, The Clash, The Chi-Lites, The Lost Boys, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and Van Morrison.

Despite remarking about the dangers of drug use to his children and some of his fellow mobsters, Tony engages in recreational use multiple times in the latter half of the series, doing lines of cocaine with Adriana, and smoking marijuana and using peyote on a trip to Las Vegas.

===Vehicles===
Like most of the mobsters in the series, Tony is shown to be partial to Cadillac and Lincoln vehicles. When discussing with Dr. Melfi a bizarre dream in which his penis falls off, he mentions that he went to the guy who used to &quot;work on my Lincoln when I drove Lincolns&quot;. For the first four seasons, Tony drives a burgundy 1999 Chevrolet Suburban LT 4x4.

In season 5 he drives a black Cadillac Escalade ESV. This black Escalade is totaled in an accident and quickly replaced with a white Escalade ESV. Tony has this Escalade until the end of the series. He has occasionally used Carmela&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz E-Class station wagon and drove it when they went places together.

=== Extramarital affairs ===
Throughout the series, Tony is shown to be a serial adulterer. He typically has mistresses whom he consistently sees for long periods, though he also has several brief one-night stands with strippers from the Bada Bing.

His wife Carmela is tacitly aware of his infidelity and usually views it as a form of masturbation, though sometimes the bottled-up tensions explode in domestic arguments. At the end of Season 4, Irina telephones Carmela in a jealous rage at Tony&#x27;s cheating on her with her cousin Svetlana, which causes Carmela to finally snap. Carmela throws Tony out of the house and begins divorce proceedings.

Tony has a strong preference for women of European, particularly Italian descent, with dark hair and eyes. His mistresses have been, in chronological order, of Russian (Irina and later Svetlana), Italian (Gloria Trillo), Italian-Cuban (Valentina La Paz), and Jewish descent (Julianna Skiff). He favors dark features but also has a few brief flings with blonde American European women, including a stewardess from Icelandic Airways and a medical assistant. He has one very short encounter with an Asian-American escort during &quot;The Test Dream&quot;.

Mistresses:
* Irina Peltsin – a young Russian woman whom he sees consistently throughout the first two seasons. She frequently calls Tony&#x27;s house when drunk, and when Carmela hints that she knows that he is seeing her, he breaks off the relationship. After her suicide attempt, Tony sends Silvio to give her a monetary compensation of $75,000 and try to reason with her about moving on with her life.
* Gloria Trillo – an Italian-American Mercedes-Benz saleswoman with stylish tastes. Tony dates her throughout Season 3 after meeting her at Dr. Melfi&#x27;s office (Melfi repeatedly expresses her disapproval of their relationship, knowing it will likely turn out a disaster). He eventually stops seeing her when she begins stalking him and calling his house while exhibiting manipulative behaviors reminding him of his own mother (which is foreshadowed very early on when she teases him by saying &quot;poor you&quot;, jokingly at first). He also understands through Dr. Melfi&#x27;s hints that Gloria is trying to use him as a means to commit suicide (akin to the suicide by cop phenomenon). Tony asks Patsy Parisi to threaten her; Parisi tells her that, if she tries again to harass Tony, the last face she&#x27;ll see will be his, not Tony&#x27;s, and that &quot;it won&#x27;t be cinematic&quot;. It turns out that it throws her over the edge and she commits suicide soon afterward, hanging herself. This greatly upsets Tony, who blames it on himself as well as Dr. Melfi.
* Valentina La Paz – a beautiful art dealer of Italian and Cuban descent, initially the mistress of Ralph Cifaretto. Tony dates her throughout Season 4. They share a love of horses, and she visits Pie-O-My at the stable with Tony. She accidentally sets her robe on fire in Season 5 while cooking eggs for Tony. Shortly thereafter he decides to get back together with Carmela, and he breaks up with Valentina while she is in the hospital recovering from second-degree burns to her head, face, and arm. Tony offers to take care of any cost related to her treatment, but their relationship ends on bad terms.
* Svetlana Kirilenko – the cousin of Tony&#x27;s ex- mistress Irina and the manager of a home care nursing business. During her childhood, Svetlana developed osteosarcoma in her leg, which was amputated soon afterward. Tony comments that she looks like the actress Greta Garbo. She was first hired as Livia Soprano&#x27;s nurse since Janice had left town. Svetlana resurfaces as Uncle Junior&#x27;s nurse after he suffers a fall at the courthouse. One afternoon while Uncle Junior is asleep, Tony has sex with Svetlana on Junior&#x27;s sofa but they are caught by Junior&#x27;s nurse, Branca. Irina soon finds out about this and informs Carmela about the affair, prompting Carmela&#x27;s violent confrontation of Tony and their ultimate separation. Svetlana later tells Tony that Branca told Irina about their affair after an argument over Svetlana&#x27;s withholding FICA and other taxes from her paycheck. Tony admires Svetlana for her toughness of spirit and her refusal to allow her disability and misfortune to get in the way of her ambitions. Arguably, Svetlana is the most psychologically balanced of all Tony&#x27;s extramarital affairs.
* Julianna Skiff – a real estate developer of Jewish descent. She meets Tony in Season 6 when offering to buy a building that he owns, to be converted into a Jamba Juice. They later begin an affair, along with a business relationship, but never consummate their relationship sexually; Tony backs off and decides to be faithful to Carmela, who stuck with him after the shooting and seems re-devoted to him. Julianna eventually dates Christopher Moltisanti and the two begin a very destructive, co-dependent drug habit; she is last seen attending Christopher&#x27;s funeral service, where she mentions that they had split up.

=== Therapy ===
Tony has suffered from panic attacks that sometimes cause him to lose consciousness since his childhood. He has his first on-screen panic attack while cooking sausages at his son&#x27;s birthday party—this occurs in a flashback in the pilot episode. Tony loses consciousness and causes a small explosion when he drops a bottle of lighter fluid onto the coals. Tony describes the experience of the panic attack as feeling like he had &quot;ginger ale in his skull&quot;. This prompts him to seek help for the attacks. After extensive testing that includes an MRI scan and blood work, no physical cause can be found, so Dr. Cusamano refers Tony to psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi.

Tony&#x27;s therapy allows a discussion of his thoughts and feelings away from both aspects of his life—this forum for reaching into the character&#x27;s thoughts has been described as a Greek chorus, and as a key for viewers to understand the character.

Tony is initially very resistant to the idea that there was a psychiatric cause for his symptoms. He resents being in therapy and refuses to accept the diagnosis of panic attacks given him by the neurologists who had investigated his illness. Tony begins to open up once Dr. Melfi explains the doctor-patient confidentiality rules. He tells her about the stress of his business life—he has a feeling that he has come in at the end of something and describes a reverence for the glorified &quot;old days&quot; of the Mafia. Tony leaves out the violence associated with his criminal career. Tony tells Dr. Melfi a story about ducks landing in his pool. He describes his mother Livia as a cold, mean-spirited woman with whom he has an openly hostile relationship. By the end of the first session Tony has admitted that he feels depressed, but storms out when Dr. Melfi presses him further about the relationship between his symptoms and the ducks.

When the family visits Green Grove, a retirement community where Tony is trying to place his mother, Livia&#x27;s derisive outburst prompts a second panic attack. Melfi prescribes Prozac as an anti-depressant, telling him that no one needs to suffer from depression with the wonders of modern pharmacology. Tony fails to attend their next scheduled session.

At their next session, Tony is still reluctant to face his psychological weaknesses. Tony is quick to credit the medication for his improved mood, but Dr. Melfi tells him it cannot be that, as it takes six weeks to work—she credits their therapy sessions. Tony describes a dream where a bird steals his penis. Melfi extrapolates that Tony has projected his love for his family onto the family of ducks living in his pool. This brings him to tears, to his consternation. She tells him that their flight from the pool sparked his panic attack through the overwhelming fear of somehow losing his own family.

In the episode &quot;46 Long&quot;, they continue discussing Tony&#x27;s mother and her difficulties living alone. Tony admits that he feels guilty because his mother could not be allowed to live with his family. We learn that he has been left to care for his mother alone by his sisters. When Dr. Melfi asks him to remember good experiences from his childhood, he has difficulty. He blames Carmela for preventing his mother from living with them. Later they discuss Livia&#x27;s car accident, and Melfi suggests depression may have contributed to the accident – Tony misunderstands her and becomes angry. Tony has a panic attack while visiting his mother&#x27;s home after she moves to Green Grove. In a later session, Dr. Melfi pushes Tony to admit he has feelings of anger towards his mother, and he again storms out. During this episode, Tony introduces the concept of him acting like the sad clown – happy on the outside but sad on the inside.

In &quot;Denial, Anger, Acceptance&quot;, Tony discusses Jackie&#x27;s cancer with Dr. Melfi. She tries to use it as an example of Tony&#x27;s negative thinking contributing to his depression. Tony becomes angry and storms out. He feels she is trying to trick him and manipulate his thoughts using the pictures that decorate her office. After Jackie worsens and Tony is called a &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by a business associate, he returns to therapy to discuss these things with Dr. Melfi. She asks him if he feels like a monster.

In &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, Tony discusses a childhood memory of an early panic attack. He saw his father and uncle mutilate Mr. Satriale, the local butcher, and later fainted at a family dinner made with free meat from Satriale&#x27;s shop. Dr. Melfi makes a connection between meat and Tony&#x27;s panic attacks.

Later Dr. Melfi tries prescribing lithium as a mood stabilizer. In the episode &quot;Isabella&quot;, Tony sinks into a severe depressive episode and experiences hallucinations—he sees a beautiful Italian woman named Isabella in his neighbor&#x27;s garden. Tony sees Isabella several times during the episode and later learns that she never existed. Melfi theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure that Tony&#x27;s subconscious produced because he was deeply upset about his own mother&#x27;s actions at the time.

In &quot;I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano&quot;, Tony abruptly ends his therapy and persuades Dr. Melfi to go into hiding when he discovers that Uncle Junior has found out about their sessions.

The relationship between Tony and Dr. Melfi is up-and-down, with Tony reaching a level of comfort with Dr. Melfi that he has never experienced with anyone else before, not even his wife. This closeness leads Tony to have something of a &quot;crush&quot; on Dr. Melfi, something that is unattainable. However, the &quot;prying&quot; from Dr. Melfi is uncomfortable for Tony and he often turns sarcastic and antagonistic towards her, leading to an ongoing strain in their relationship. In the episode when Tony&#x27;s sister, Janice, goes back to Seattle, it is revealed during a rushed conversation between Janice and Tony that their mother suffers from narcissistic personality disorder.

During the episode &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, aired in part II of season six, Melfi&#x27;s therapist suggests to her that her work with Tony could be considered enabling toward Tony&#x27;s sociopathic tendencies. Finally, in the penultimate episode of the series, &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, Melfi severs her relationship with Tony after reading research recommended by her therapist that indicates sociopaths can use talk therapy to improve their skills in manipulating others and use what is learned in therapy to become more capable criminals.

=== Shootings ===
In the first season, Tony is attacked by William Johnson &quot;Petite&quot; Clayborn and Rasheen Ray, two hitmen sent by Donnie Paduana to execute Tony. Tony sustains an injury to his ear, which is partially shot off, and minor bruises and cuts from crashing his vehicle. One of the two assailants, Clayborn, is shot dead by Ray in an attempt to kill Tony, and Ray is left bruised but runs off.

In the premiere of the sixth season, &quot;Members Only&quot;, Junior Soprano, suffering from dementia, believes Tony to be Gennaro &quot;Little Pussy&quot; Malanga, and shoots him in the abdomen. Tony dials 911 but loses consciousness before being able to tell the operator what happened.

In the second episode of the sixth season, &quot;Join the Club&quot;, Tony is in a medically induced coma in the hospital. In the second and third episodes, the viewer sees Tony in a dream-like state, eventually arriving at what could be purgatory, where he is greeted by a man who takes the physical form of his late cousin Tony Blundetto. The shadowy figure in the doorway of the house has the profile of his mother, who is dead. The voice of a younger version of his daughter calls him back. At the end of the third episode, he awakes from his coma in a confused but stable state.

By the fourth episode, Tony is mobile and fully aware and has regained his voice. Tony&#x27;s attitude toward life is changed by his near-death experience. He has yet to discuss his experiences while unconscious with anyone close to him. However, in the Season 6 episode &quot;Kaisha&quot;, he admits to Phil Leotardo (who had just suffered a heart attack), that while he was in a coma, he went to a place where he never wants to go again. While talking philosophy with John Schwinn, another patient at the hospital, he mentions that while in the coma he had the experience of being drawn towards somewhere he did not want to go and narrowly avoided it.

In the sixth episode of season 6, part 2, &quot;Kennedy and Heidi&quot;, Tony sustains minor injuries in a car accident that seriously injures his nephew, Christopher Moltisanti. Tony suffocates Christopher after this accident. Tony is on bed rest for a few days and quickly recovers. Nonetheless, this gives his family quite a scare and a painful memory of his nearly fatal shooting the previous year.

===Dreams===
Tony sometimes has vivid dreams that are shown to the viewer. Episodes with dream sequences include &quot;Pax Soprana&quot;, &quot;Isabella&quot;, &quot;Funhouse&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, &quot;Calling All Cars&quot;, and &quot;The Test Dream&quot;.

In the pilot, Tony tells Dr. Melfi about a dream he had wherein a screw in his belly button when removed, causes his penis to fall off. He tries to find a car mechanic (who had worked on his Lincoln when Tony drove Lincolns) to put it back on, but a duck swoops down and snatches it from his hand.

In &quot;Meadowlands&quot;, Tony has a dream that several people in his life are present in Dr. Melfi&#x27;s office: Hesh Rabkin strolling by the window, A.J. behind the door, Silvio Dante having sex with a woman in the waiting room, and Paulie Walnuts and Big Pussy reading Chinese newspapers. This causes him to worry that people will find out he is seeing a psychiatrist. The dream ends with Tony confronting Melfi, seeing Jackie Aprile, Sr. on his deathbed smoking a cigarette, asking Tony, &quot;You smell that? That&#x27;s rain,&quot; and only to find out that Melfi is his mother, Livia.

In &quot;Pax Soprana&quot;, Tony has several dreams and fantasies about Dr. Melfi. He becomes convinced that he is in love with her, but she turns him down when he makes advances toward her.

In &quot;Isabella&quot;, Tony, suffering from depression after Big Pussy disappears, acquaints himself with a dental student named Isabella who is staying in the Cusamano home while they are on vacation. He later discovers that he had hallucinated Isabella due to taking too much lithium and that Isabella represented the mother he never had.

In &quot;Funhouse&quot;, an extended dream sequence exposes many of Tony&#x27;s subconscious thoughts and feelings through symbolic and sometimes bizarre events: he attempts suicide to preempt a doctor&#x27;s diagnosis of early death by dousing himself in gasoline and lighting himself on fire; he witnesses himself shooting Paulie Walnuts to death during a card game; he has an innuendo-laden conversation with Dr. Melfi while sporting a prominent erection, and a fish that speaks with the voice of Big Pussy confirms his suspicions that the longtime friend and soldier is a federal informant.

In &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, Tony dreams of his ex-mistress Gloria Trillo shortly after learning of her suicide by hanging. He visits her apartment and finds her in a black dress with a black scarf around her neck. She is cooking dinner, and when she goes over to the oven the scarf drapes across Tony. Plaster falls in front of Tony and when he looks up, he sees that the chandelier is almost pulled out of the ceiling. Gloria is suddenly back at the table and offers Tony a choice between seeing what she has under her dress or her scarf. As she begins to peel away the scarf, Tony wakes up and makes his way to the bathroom for some medication.

In &quot;Calling All Cars&quot;, Tony has two dreams featuring Ralph Cifaretto. In the first, he is being driven by Carmela in the back of his father&#x27;s old car while Ralph sits in the passenger seat. A caterpillar is crawling on the back of Ralph&#x27;s head. Tony&#x27;s fellow passenger in the back seat changes; Gloria Trillo and Svetlana Kirilenko are both seen. The caterpillar turns into a butterfly. Dr. Melfi later tells him that the dream signifies a change for Ralph (recently killed by Tony) and Carmela being in control, which Tony doesn&#x27;t like.

In the second dream, Tony follows Ralph to an old house, which Ralph enters. Tony is dressed in trousers, suspenders, and an undershirt. He knocks on the door and a female figure descends slowly in shadow; the door creaks ominously. Tony says he is there for the stonemason job but does not speak English well (Tony&#x27;s grandfather was an immigrant stonemason). Just as Tony is about to enter the house, he wakes up.

In &quot;The Test Dream&quot;, Tony comes to terms with having to kill his cousin Tony Blundetto. The episode reflects on his inner demons and fears, including his children&#x27;s future, his relationship with his wife, his infidelities, deceased acquaintances—including some who have died by his hand or by his orders—his fate, and his relationship with his father. He is again shown in his father&#x27;s old car, accompanied by a range of past associates.

In &quot;Join the Club&quot;, a comatose Tony finds himself in an alternate universe where he is a law-abiding salesman on a business trip. Among other differences, his accent has changed and his hotel&#x27;s bartender condescends to him (in sharp contrast to the bartender at The Bing, who is a recurring punching bag for Tony). Tony has mistakenly taken another man&#x27;s briefcaseKevin Finnerty&#x27;salong with all of his identification and work. The episode follows his attempts to discern his identity, recover his briefcase, and get back to his family.

In &quot;Kennedy and Heidi&quot;, a stressed Tony Soprano has a dream following the death of Christopher Moltisanti. In this dream, he tells his therapist that Christopher was a burden and that he is relieved that he was dead. After that, he also tells her that he murdered Big Pussy and his cousin Tony Blundetto. Following the dream, he acts differently to his friends and family, trying to see if they also feel relieved now that Christopher is dead.

==Legacy and cultural impact==

The character of Tony Soprano was the first likable &quot;antihero&quot; character in television. Playwright Craig Wright stated, &quot;A show like &quot;The Sopranos&quot; has a soothing quality because ultimately there&#x27;s an unspoken assumption behind it that even the most monstrous people are haunted by the same concerns we&#x27;re haunted by.&quot; Tony Soprano quickly became a pop culture icon during the show&#x27;s run. In an article for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Chris Lee referred to Tony Soprano as a &quot;cultural sensation&quot; who became the &quot;unlikeliest of sex symbols.&quot; On the importance of Gandolfini&#x27;s performance, Lee stated: &quot;He forever rejiggered television&#x27;s fascination with morally challenged antiheroes and less-than-physically-perfect protagonists.&quot;

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote, &quot;Women made Tony Soprano an unlikely sex symbol – and the men found him no less seductive. Wish fulfillment has always been at the queasy heart of the mobster genre, the longing for a life outside the bounds of convention, mingled with the conflicted desire to see the perpetrator punished for the same transgression. So it was for the fictional men of the straight world on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, who were drawn to Tony&#x27;s flame with consistently disastrous results. Likewise for viewers, for whom a life of taking, killing, and sleeping with whomever and whatever one wants had an undeniable, if conflict-laden, appeal.&quot;

The final scene of &quot;Made in America&quot; became the subject of much discussion, controversy, and analysis after its original broadcast; however, Chase consistently refused to give any definitive answers. The use of an abrupt cut to black followed by several seconds of silence led many viewers to initially believe that their cable or DVR had cut out at a crucial moment. Opposing interpretations soon emerged among viewers regarding the ultimate fate of Tony, with some believing that he was killed while others believed that he remained alive. During a November 2021 interview with &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Chase made comments which seemed to confirm Tony Soprano was killed at the end of the final episode.

Following Gandolfini&#x27;s death on June 19, 2013, his portrayal of Tony Soprano was praised for its influence on subsequent other TV characters. &quot;TV Guide&quot; columnist Matt Roush stated, &quot;Without Tony, there&#x27;s no Vic Mackey of &quot;The Shield&quot;, no Al Swearengen of &quot;Deadwood&quot;, no Don Draper of &quot;Mad Men&quot; (whose creator, Matthew Weiner, honed his craft as a writer on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;).&quot; Similar testimonials were included by his co-stars and colleagues; Bryan Cranston stated that his &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; character, Walter White, would not have existed without Tony Soprano. Mark Lawson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Gandolfini for his &quot;towering central performance&quot; as Tony Soprano, writing: &quot;&quot;The Sopranos&quot; was part of a wave of American TV dramas that finally persuaded cineastes and critics who had been snobbish and dismissive about television as a medium to accept the smaller screen as an artistic equivalent of the larger one. Although many of those who watched and wrote about TV had got this message much earlier, the remarkable and sustained range of Gandolfini&#x27;s portrayal of Tony Soprano played a major part in ending any remaining inferiority complex about the medium.&quot;

Gandolfini&#x27;s son Michael was cast in 2019 for the 2021 film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot; to play a young Tony Soprano, as a prequel to the show. Michael, having never watched &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, watched through it to prepare for the role, describing it as an intense process.

<text>The Notion Club Papers is an abandoned novel by J. R. R. Tolkien, written in 1945 and published posthumously in &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;, the 9th volume of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;. It is a time travel story, written while &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was being developed. The Notion Club is a fictionalization of Tolkien&#x27;s own such club, the Inklings. Tolkien&#x27;s mechanism for the exploration of time is through lucid dreams. These allow club members to experience events as far back as the destruction of the Atlantis-like island of Númenor, as narrated in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

The unfinished text of &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; runs for some 120 pages in &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;, accompanied by 40 pages of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s commentary and notes, with examples of the pages hand-written by his father.

== Context ==

J. R. R. Tolkien was a scholar of English literature, a philologist and a medievalist interested in language and poetry from the Middle Ages, especially that of Anglo-Saxon England and Northern Europe. His professional knowledge of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, telling of a pagan world but with a Christian narrator, helped to shape his fictional world of Middle-earth. His intention to create what has been called &quot;a mythology for England&quot; led him to construct not only stories but a fully-formed world, Middle-earth, with invented languages, peoples, cultures, and history. Among his many influences were his own Roman Catholic faith, medieval languages and literature, including Norse mythology. He is best known as the author of the high fantasy works &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–1955), and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (1977), all set in Middle-earth.

== Structure and plot ==

The story revolves around the meetings of an Oxford arts discussion group, the Notion Club. During these meetings, Alwin Arundel Lowdham discusses his lucid dreams about Númenor, a lost civilisation connected with Atlantis and with Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. Through these dreams, he &quot;discovers&quot; much about the Númenor story and the languages of Middle-earth (notably Quenya, Sindarin, and Adûnaic). While not finished, at the end of the given story it becomes clear Lowdham himself is a reincarnation of sorts of Elendil, leader of the men who escaped the destruction of Númenor. Other members of the Club mention their vivid dreams of other times and places.

&quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; is elaborately constructed. The main story (the Notion Club, itself the frame of the Númenor story) is set within a frame story. Both are set in the future, after the actual time of writing, 1945. Embedded within the story are Tolkien&#x27;s versions of European legends: &quot;King Sheave&quot;, and &quot;The Death of St. Brendan&quot;, a three-page poem also titled &#x27;Imram&#x27;. 

In the frame story, a Mr. Howard Green finds documents in sacks of waste paper at Oxford in 2012. These documents, the Notion Club Papers of the title, are the incomplete notes of meetings of the Notion Club; these meetings are said to have occurred in the 1980s. The notes, written by one of the participants, include references to events that &#x27;occurred&#x27; in the 1970s and 1980s. Green publishes a first edition containing excerpts from the documents. Two scholars read the first edition, ask to examine the documents, and then submit a full report. The &quot;Notes to the Second Edition&quot; mentions the contradictory evidence in dating the documents, and an alternative date is presented: they may have been written in the 1940s.

== Writing and publication ==

J. R. R. Tolkien wrote several unfinished drafts of &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; in 1945. The 120-page fragment was published posthumously by George Allen &amp; Unwin in the UK and by Houghton Mifflin in the US, within &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;, the 9th volume of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, in 1992. The book includes in addition some 40 pages of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s commentary and notes on the abandoned novel, and reproduces examples of pages hand-written by his father.

==Analysis==

===Literary group===


The text comments on C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;. Lewis and Tolkien were close friends and members of the Inklings literary club. The two men had agreed to write space travel (Lewis) and time travel (Tolkien) novels, since they agreed there were too few stories in existence that they really liked. Tolkien&#x27;s remarks on the trilogy are similar in style to Lewis&#x27;s commentary on Tolkien&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lay of Leithian&quot;, in which he created a fictional history of scholarship of the poem and even referred to other manuscript traditions to recommend changes to the poem. 
Tolkien&#x27;s biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, describes &quot;The Notion Club&quot; as a &quot;thinly disguised&quot; version of the Inklings, noting that the time travellers are two Oxford dons who are members of the club.

Jane Stanford links &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; to John O&#x27;Connor Power&#x27;s 1899 &quot;The Johnson Club Papers&quot;; the two books have a similar title page. The Johnson Club was a &quot;Public House School&quot; and met in taverns as the Inklings did. The purpose was &quot;Fellowship and free Exchange of Mind&quot;. Both clubs presented papers &quot;which were read before the members and discussed&quot;. The Johnson Club was named for Samuel Johnson, who like Tolkien, had a strong connection to Pembroke College, Oxford. Stanley Unwin, Tolkien&#x27;s publisher, was a nephew of Fisher Unwin, the founding member of The Johnson Club.

=== Time travel ===

&quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; may be seen as an attempt to re-write the incomplete &quot;The Lost Road&quot; (written around 1936-1937), being another attempt to tie the Númenórean legend in with a more modern tale through time travel. It follows the then-popular theory of J. W. Dunne, who had suggested in his 1927 &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; that dreams could combine memories of both past and future events, and that time could flow differently for observers in different dimensions. The modern name &quot;Alwin&quot;, the Old English name &quot;Ælfwine&quot;, and the Quenya name &quot;Elendil&quot; all mean &quot;Elf-friend&quot;; in &quot;The Lost Road&quot;, the story involves father-son characters named Edwin/Elwin, Eadwine/Aelfwine, Audoin/Alboin, Amandil/Elendil, all meaning &quot;Bliss-friend/Elf-friend&quot;, as the pair travel successively further back in time all the way through history to Númenor, just as the protagonists of &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; do in their lucid dreams. This situates Númenor, whose downfall is described in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, as part of an invented mythology for England. Tolkien&#x27;s biographer John Garth adds that &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; character Lowdham&#x27;s middle name, Arundel, is both an English place-name and an echo of the legendarium&#x27;s Éarendel (an ancestor of Elendil).

Both stories however break off before much time-travelling takes place. Tolkien finally managed to incorporate literary explorations of time in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in the form of a visit to what seems to be the deep past in the Elvish land of Lothlorien, following a tradition that in Elfland, time is different; the stay lasts a month, but feels like only a few days. According to Christopher Tolkien, had his father continued &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;, he would have linked the real world of Alwin Lowdham with his eponymous ancestor Ælfwine of England, the fictional compiler of &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, and with Atlantis. One of the members of the Notion Club, Michael George Ramer, combines lucid dreams with time-travel and experiences the tsunami that sank Númenor. He cannot tell if it is history, or fantasy, or something in between. Verlyn Flieger writes that the journeying about of the protagonist recalls the Celtic Imram voyages, noting that Tolkien wrote a poem named &quot;Imram&quot; at the same time, and it was the only element published in his lifetime.

Virginia Luling writes of &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; that &quot;Tolkien had reason to abandon it: the existing chapters are unsuccessful, though with gleams.&quot; Flieger comments that had either &quot;The Lost Road&quot; or &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; been finished,

===Prophecy===

&quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; mentions a great storm in England, on 12 June 1987. The actual Great Storm of 1987 occurred in October of that year. Christopher Tolkien drew attention to this, saying &quot;my father&#x27;s &#x27;prevision&#x27; was only out by four months&quot;.

<text>Middle East Technical University (commonly referred to as METU; in Turkish, &quot;Orta Doğu Teknik Üniversitesi&quot;, ODTÜ) is a public technical university located in Ankara, Turkey. The university focuses on research and education in engineering, natural sciences and social sciences, offering 41 undergraduate programs across five faculties and 105 master&#x27;s and 70 doctoral programs through five graduate schools. The main campus of METU spans an area of , comprising, in addition to academic and auxiliary facilities, a forest area of , and the natural Lake Eymir. METU has more than 120,000 alumni worldwide. The official language of instruction at METU is English.

Over one third of the 1,000 highest scoring students in the national university entrance examination choose to enroll in METU; and most of its departments accept the top 0.1% of the nearly 3 million applicants. METU had the greatest share in national research funding by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) in the last five years, and it is the leading university in Turkey in terms of the number of European Union Framework Programme (FP) projects participation. Over 40% of METU&#x27;s undergraduate alumni choose to pursue graduate studies.

==History==

=== Foundation and vision ===
In 1954, Charles Abrams from the MIT School of Architecture and Planning, commissioned by the United Nations to study housing issues and the state of architectural, urban and regional planning education in the Middle East, visited Turkey. Upon completing his survey, Abrams submitted a report to the UN recommending the establishment of a technological institute in Turkey to provide education in architecture and planning. Subsequently, the UN assigned G. Holmes Perkins from the University of Pennsylvania to assist in establishing an institute that would train Turkish architects and urban-regional planners. 

Middle East Technical University was founded under the name &quot;Orta Doğu Teknoloji Enstitüsü&quot; (English: Middle East Institute of Technology) on November 15, 1956, by then Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, the Director-General of Highways Vecdi Diker, and a group of academics. The university was established to contribute to the development of Turkey and the surrounding regions of the Middle East, Balkans, and Caucasus by fostering skilled professionals in the natural and social sciences. &quot;Arrangements and Procedures as for the Foundation of METU, Law No 6213&quot; was enacted on January 22, 1957, whereby the current name &quot;Orta Doğu Teknik Üniversitesi&quot; (&quot;ODTÜ&quot;) was adopted. Finally, the &quot;Foundation Act No 7907&quot;, setting forth the particular standing of METU and establishing it as a juridical entity, was enacted on May 27, 1959.

During the legislative discussions regarding METU, the establishment law was debated in parliament. Democrat Party deputy Münib Hayri Ürgüplü emphasized that &quot;in a period marked by various ideological threats in the Middle East, the university would play a crucial role by educating young people armed with the profound truths of science to effectively confront these challenges&quot;. During the legislative discussions regarding the laws for Middle East Technical University, Zakar Tarver, a Democrat Party member of parliament and of Armenian descent, proposed that the university be exempt from all types of taxation.

The governance of METU was distinctively structured under a Board of Trustees, initially composed of five members, unlike any other institute managed by the Ministry of National Education. Temporary directorship was assumed by Thomas Godfrey until March 1959, with Marvin Sevely also part of the initial foreign faculty.

METU initially started with programs in Architecture and City Planning during the 1956-1957 academic year and expanded to include Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and programs under the Faculty of Administrative Sciences such as Business Administration, Public Administration, and Industrial Management in subsequent years. Classes were initially held in a small building owned by the Retirement Fund in Kızılay and barracks near the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.

=== Early developments ===
In its early days, Middle East Technical University, initially heavily criticized due to its humble facilities resembling a middle school building, quickly embarked on efforts to establish its own campus. Although the campus location had not been finalized, a plan proposed by G. Holmes Perkins was accepted. Amid considerations to use either the lands behind Yalıncak Village or the buildings of the Etimesgut Sugar Factory for the campus site, the government pressed for immediate foundation laying. Consequently, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Yalıncak Village on October 2, 1957, attended by nearly all ambassadors in Ankara, then-President Celal Bayar, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, and other ministers. The first chairman of the METU Board of Trustees, Vecdi Diker, had brought an excavator from the General Directorate of Highways to commence the digging. At the start of the 1957–1958 academic year, the Faculty of Architecture, the Faculty of Engineering, and the Faculty of Administrative Sciences were established. In 1959, the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was completed. Within the framework of Perkins’ campus plan, the first building designated was the Faculty of Administrative Sciences, and in 1959, a Turkish team comprising Dr. Turgut Cansever, Ertürk Yener, and Mehmet Tataroğlu won an international design competition for it. However, the project was put on hold as the campus location was still not definitively established.

The 1960 Turkish coup d&#x27;état led to significant upheaval at METU. Then-Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, a member of the METU Board of Trustees, and MP Ahmet Tokuş were arrested and expelled from the board, spreading fears of the university&#x27;s potential closure. Colonel Sami Küçük, a member of the National Unity Committee, opposed other junta members who wanted the university closed, arguing it was Adnan Menderes&#x27; project, and ensured that educational activities at METU continued. In March 1959, Willis Raymond Woolrich, who also served as the dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Texas, was dismissed as an advisory rector following a law passed in August 1960 that terminated the Board of Trustees&#x27; mandate. After Woolrich&#x27;s rectorship, Edwin S. Burdell, who previously served as president of the Cooper Union for 22 years and as the first dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, took on the role of president at METU. After Burdell&#x27;s period, Prof. Dr. Turhan Feyzioğlu was appointed as the first Turkish rector of METU. During his speech at the opening ceremony, Rector Feyzioğlu emphasized, &quot;Middle East Technical University is entirely a Turkish university.&quot; In June 1960, METU graduated its first class, comprising 30 students including 11 from Mechanical Engineering and 19 from Architecture, and the top student was awarded a prize of 1000 lira along with a plaque.

On October 27, 1960, in response to the military government&#x27;s decision under Law No. 114 to expel 147 academic staff members from universities, an event known as the 147 Incident, many rectors and faculty members, including Feyzioğlu, resigned in protest; however, Feyzioğlu&#x27;s resignation was not accepted, and he continued in his role. After Feyzioğlu was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in January 1961, he was succeeded as rector by Prof. Dr. Seha Meray on February 23, 1961. Shortly after Meray&#x27;s appointment, the university witnessed a student boycott due to uncertainties about the recognition of diplomas and concerns over educational facilities. The boycott ended following discussions with the rector. Meray served as rector for about three months before resigning due to illness, and his duties were temporarily assumed by Uğur Ersoy. After Ersoy&#x27;s resignation in August 1961, Associate Professor Arif Payaslıoğlu took over for two months.

On April 26, 1961, the Board of Trustees decided on Aşağı Balgat for the new campus, and a new national competition with an international jury was organized. The winning project was by Behruz Çinici and Altuğ Çinici, announced in September 1961. Kemal Kurdaş, who became rector on November 22, 1961, prioritized the campus construction. Initial plans included the Architecture Faculty, laboratories for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the rectorate building, the first section of the dining hall, and two dormitory buildings. On December 3, 1961, the first tree-planting activities at METU took place, with students planting 135,000 saplings. During the initial surveys near Yalıncak Village, Kemal Kurdaş identified remnants of historical structures and artifacts, indicating the site&#x27;s archaeological importance. This discovery was reported to the Ministry of National Education, the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums, and the Ankara Archaeology Museum, now known as the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations. Subsequently, archaeological excavations were initiated under the direction of archaeologist Burhan Tezcan.

Despite constraints in faculty and infrastructure, METU established departments of mathematics, physics, theoretical physics, chemistry, education, humanities, and psychology, along with a preparatory class, in 1961. The construction blueprint for the campus was finalized in January 1962, prioritizing the completion of the Architecture Faculty and infrastructure tunnels within the first two years. The cornerstone laying ceremony for the Architecture Faculty building took place on May 11, 1962, attended by then-President Cemal Gürsel. Decisions were made to relocate the preparatory class to the new campus, and by summer 1962, four temporary barracks had been constructed to facilitate this transition. The preparatory class began its activities at the new location in October 1962, marking it as the first academic unit to move to the campus. The preparatory class was later formalized into a Preparatory School by the Board of Trustees. Extensive tree-planting activities followed, with over 1.5 million trees planted by the rector and students. By the academic year 1961-62, student enrollment at METU reached 1,025, increasing to 1,274 by the 1962-63 academic year. The Architecture Faculty building, which cost 12.5 million lira, became operational on September 30, 1963. The new campus was officially inaugurated on October 1, 1963, with a ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister İsmet İnönü. By the start of the 1963-64 academic year, a significant portion of the university had transitioned to the new campus, hosting 1,893 Turkish and 167 foreign students, taught by 310 Turkish and 56 foreign faculty members. From this cohort, 158 undergraduate and 59 graduate students graduated.

The METU Library, established in 1956 with a donation of 50 books from the United Nations, began offering services that same year. By 1957, the library staff comprised Füruzan Olşen and Solmaz İzdemir, who both had received master&#x27;s degrees in librarianship in the United States. On January 4, 1958, to organize the library in a contemporary sense, UNESCO expert Natelle Isley was appointed as the library director. In March 1958, under the foundational principles concerning the library&#x27;s organization, the American Library of Congress Classification System was adopted. This made METU Library the first in Turkey to utilize a system now commonly employed by many university and research libraries across the country.

In July 1959, UNESCO expert Donald A. Redmond took over as library director. During the tenure of D. R. Kalia, the third director appointed in 1961, the idea of establishing a central library on campus was proposed and accepted in October 1961. William W. Bennett, the fourth and final UNESCO expert, began his tenure as library director in 1962. In September 1962, Paul Wasserman, Director of Libraries at Cornell University, visited Turkey to assess the development of the METU Library and prepared a report that helped secure a financial grant of $30,500 through the AID Cornell project. The year 1963 was primarily dedicated to the completion of campus construction, including the architectural planning of the METU Library. The library&#x27;s design, still in use today, was developed by architect Behruz Çinici. As UNESCO assistance was concluding, further support was received from CENTO, OECD, and later the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), with the most significant being from USAID. Out of the $4.5 million allocated to the university by USAID, Kemal Kurdaş dedicated $1.5 million to the library. Dr. Robert Downs, Dean of the Library Science Department and Director of Libraries at the University of Illinois, visited and wrote a highly positive report. The library also houses collections named in honor of significant figures, including the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library and a collection donated by the British Government in memory of Winston Churchill. This latter donation added 1,000 volumes to the library&#x27;s collection, increasing it to 50,000 volumes by the end of 1965.

By the 1963-64 academic years, the total area of completed buildings on campus had exceeded 67,000 square meters. In 1964, the METU Computer Center was established to support administrative data processes, equipped with computers, printers, sorters, and punch card preparation machines. Later that year, a decision was made to enhance the center&#x27;s role in academic support, leading to the invitation of Turkish academics Dr. Şenol Utku and Dr. Cenap Oran from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to assist in setting up a computer system. The team opted to lease an IBM 1620 computer system, widely used in American universities, which was installed at the Physics Department in 1965. In the same year, following a competition held to place a monument on campus, the winning Atatürk Monument along with the second-placed Tree of Science were installed at Middle East Technical University.

In 1967, METU focused intensively on scientific projects, conducting 219 projects during the year and receiving the highest number of awards from the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (&quot;TÜBİTAK&quot;). At the beginning of the academic year, the university enrolled 1,843 new students using a newly implemented testing method, raising the total student population to 5,127. The faculty increased by 20% to 607 members, and new departments such as Theoretical Chemistry and Computer Sciences were established, alongside the Modern Biology Option. The construction of the Central Library was completed, and 14,620 new books were added. The library&#x27;s holdings of scientific journals and periodicals rose to 1,456.

In the same year, under the presidency of Rector Kurdaş, the &quot;Committee to Rescue and Evaluate Historical Artifacts that Will Be Submerged by the Keban Dam Lake&quot; was established, launching an eight-year comprehensive study of the Keban region&#x27;s archaeology, history, architecture, ethnography, folklore, music, and language, with a particular focus on rescuing archaeological artifacts at risk of submersion due to the dam construction.

=== Recent history ===
In July 1987, following the completion of Rector Gönlübol&#x27;s term, Prof. Dr. Ömer Saatçioğlu, a faculty member from the Department of Industrial Engineering, was appointed as the rector of METU. In 1988, the University Senate designated May 27th as &quot;METU Day&quot; based on the original enactment date of METU&#x27;s founding law, and decided to celebrate this day annually with a ceremony. Since then, METU Day has been celebrated on the last working day of the week in which May 27th falls. In 1989, the first Alumni Day, which later became a tradition, was organized, honoring alumni who had reached the 30th anniversary of their graduation with plaques. That same year, the university significantly expanded its computing capacity, reaching a total of one thousand personal computers, established a fiber optic network, and connected to international networks.

In 1987, preliminary work began on establishing a science park, known as Teknokent, aimed at supporting technology-based companies. This initiative led to the opening of the Technology Development Center (&quot;TEKMER&quot;) in 1990, following a collaboration agreement with the Small and Medium Industry Development Organization.

On July 7, 1992, a law was passed to abolish the system of rector appointments by the Council of Higher Education, transitioning to the current electoral system for selecting rectors. Following the end of Ömer Saatçioğlu&#x27;s term in September 1992, the first elections under this new system resulted in the appointment of Prof. Dr. Süha Sevük, a faculty member from the Department of Civil Engineering, as the rector. That year also saw the establishment of the BİLTİR Center, which included Turkey&#x27;s first CAD/CAM Laboratory, under the auspices of the rectorate.

On April 12, 1993, Turkey&#x27;s first internet connection was established through a 64 Kbps leased line between Ankara and Washington, facilitated by the routers in the METU Computer Center. This achievement led to the creation of Turkey&#x27;s first internet pages with a .tr domain. In 1994, with the support of Rector Sevük and Secretary-General Mehmet Çalışkan, efforts to establish Radio METU began, and broadcasting started in 1995 on frequency 103.1 FM. Rector Süha Sevük was reelected on June 25, 1996.

In 1998, the METU Development Foundation initiated a project to establish schools across Anatolia, starting with schools in Ankara, Kayseri, Denizli, Mersin and İzmir, with plans to increase the number of schools to between 10 and 12. On November 19, 1998, following a protocol signed with the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces and the Defence Industry Agency, the MODSİM-LAB was established. The laboratory, located in a new building on the campus, was operational by June 24, 1999, as a Research and Development Laboratory and later attained center status, becoming known as METU-Turkish Armed Forces &quot;MODSİMMER&quot; (Modeling and Simulation Applications Research Center).

Following the devastating Marmara earthquake on August 17, 1999, which resulted in approximately 18,000 fatalities, METU established a crisis management center and initiated the &quot;METU Earthquake Relief Campaign&quot;. During this campaign, METU dormitories were opened to those affected by the disaster, and the &quot;METU Earthquake Scholarship&quot; campaign was launched to support students at primary, secondary, and university levels.

In early 2000, METU, along with leading Turkish universities including Bilkent, Boğaziçi, Hacettepe, İTÜ, Koç and Sabancı, formed the Anatolian University Libraries Consortium to enhance the global information network access for Turkish academics and students and to support education and research through library resources. At the same time, an inventory of all software/hardware/embedded systems owned by the METU Computer Center was compiled, and compatibility studies for the year 2000 were conducted. On August 7, 2000, following the end of Süha Sevük&#x27;s term, elections led to the appointment of Prof. Dr. Ural Akbulut, a faculty member from the Department of Chemistry, as rector.

In 2001, the State Planning Organization approved the &quot;Faculty Development Project&quot;, providing 14 million Turkish Lira in funding. That same year, the Technology Development Zones Law was passed by the Grand National Assembly, establishing METU Teknokent as Turkey&#x27;s first technology park. In June 2002, METU, together with Ankara University, İTÜ, Boğaziçi University and Bilkent University, formed the &quot;Inter-University European Union Initiative&quot; to collaborate on EU projects. This initiative organized 12 workshops under the 7 main themes of the 6th Framework Programs and started efforts to create national networks across the country. METU became the first European university to achieve equivalence under the new criteria of the American accreditation body ABET, accrediting all its engineering programs in Turkey, and by 2003, it was one of only two universities in Turkey with fully accredited engineering programs.

The establishment laws for the Northern Cyprus Campus were passed by the Assembly of the Republic of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 2003, granting it legal entity status and marking the beginning of its educational activities. On December 8, 2004, the Central Laboratory was inaugurated as the Education, Measurement, Molecular Biology, and Biotechnology R&amp;D Centers. In 2005, 5 million Turkish Lira was allocated for projects under the Expanded National and International Projects (ENIP) scheme, and significant progress was made in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Smart Glass, and Raw Material for Rental Medicines ENIP projects, reaching the product and patent stages. The METU Science and Technology Museum also opened its doors in 2005.

A further 1,500 students are attending programs in the new Northern Cyprus Campus. Over 40% of METU&#x27;s students go on to graduate school. Each academic year, METU hosts over 1,700 regular international students from 94 different countries; and through 168 Erasmus Programme agreements and 182 bilateral exchange and cooperation agreements with universities abroad (e.g. in Central Asia, Middle East, North America, Australia, Far East and Pacific Region), it sends 350 students and receives 300 students and 50 researchers annually. As of 2023, the university employs 2,603 faculty (professors and associate professors), 479 academic instructors, and over 708 research assistants. The number of the alumni exceeds 500,000 (about 350,000 having completed undergraduate programs).

METU has about 40 undergraduate programs within the faculties of Engineering, Architecture, Arts and Sciences, Economic and Administrative Sciences, and Education, and there are 97 masters and 62 doctorate programs available in the graduate schools of Natural and Applied Sciences, Social Sciences, Informatics, Applied Mathematics, and Marine Sciences. METU commonly ranks close to the top among research universities in Turkey, with over one third of the 1,000 highest scoring students in the national university entrance examination choosing to enroll; and most of its departments accepting the top 0.1% of the nearly 1.5 million applicants. In the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities published in July 2009, aiming to measure through web-based publications the institution size, research output, and impact, METU ranked as the world&#x27;s 435th (1st place within Turkey) among 15,000 universities, being the only university from Turkey to get included among the top 500. Recently, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings published in September 2016 placed METU at the 501–600th position worldwide based on indicators of teaching, research, influence, innovation, and international character, making it one of the six universities from Turkey listed among the top 600 (the other being Bilkent University at number 351–400). The QS World University Rankings 2010 by Quacquarelli Symonds ranked METU as 185th worldwide in the field of engineering and technology, and as 333rd in the field of natural sciences.

The language of instruction at METU is English. All enrolled students are required to have a degree of proficiency in English for academic purposes, and this is assured by a proficiency examination before the commence of studies. Students with unsatisfactory knowledge of English follow a preparatory English education for one year, given by the METU School of Foreign Languages. Two exceptions instructed in Turkish are the Turkish language and the history of Turkish revolution courses mandated by the Council of Higher Education.

===International perspective===

Researchers from METU actively take part in many COST, EUREKA, NASA, NATO, NSF, UN, World Bank, Jean Monnet, Erasmus Mundus, Leonardo and SOCRATES projects. METU has been involved in 56 European Union 6th Framework Programme (FP6) projects, including the coordination of 12 FP6 and 3 Networks of Excellence projects. Within the 7th Framework Programme (FP7), 33 research projects involve participation of METU, since 2007.

As of 2020, METU has 22 international joint degree programmes with European and American universities at the undergraduate and graduate levels. METU is a member of various associations and networks dealing with international education and exchange, including EUA, EAIE, IIE, GE3, SEFI, and CIEE. The university also actively participates in AIESEC and IAESTE summer internship programs. English as the language of instruction in all its degree programs has greatly facilitated METU&#x27;s international involvements and accommodation of international students and researchers.

METU continually goes through external assessment, accreditation, and certification by international organizations. In 1991, METU initiated a long-term program to have its engineering programs evaluated by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), the recognized U.S. accreditor of college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology. This process was concluded with the Faculty of Engineering having all its thirteen undergraduate programs declared as &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to the ABET accredited programs in the USA. The university has completed the evaluation process of Institutional Evaluation Programme (IEP) of the European University Association (EUA) in 2002.

Because of METU&#x27;s effort to maintain international standards, the Faculty of Engineering was awarded in 1977 the &quot;Silver Badge of Honor&quot; by the UNESCO International Center for Engineering Education and the &quot;Meritorious Achievement Award in Accreditation Activities&quot; by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). METU was awarded the international Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1995 for its forestation program.

Being the pioneer institution of the country to connect to the Internet backbone in the early 1990s, METU also manages Turkey&#x27;s Country Code Top-level Domain (ccTLD) (the &quot;.tr&quot; domain).

===METU library===

The METU Main Library has one of the largest collections in Turkey, containing over 500,000 books classified according to the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) scheme. The library subscribes to 1,500 print journals (170,270 volumes) and it provides access to 76,671 electronic journals, 587,493 electronic books, and 66 electronic reference sources. The library collections also hold over 1,780 book and serial CDs, 1,300 doctoral dissertations and 11,600 masters theses. Abstracts for doctoral dissertations and some master theses from North American colleges and universities and some accredited international universities are also provided, starting from 1861, with full texts available from the year 1997. The library&#x27;s collections are predominantly in English, but there are also items in Turkish, German, and French.

==Campuses==
===Ankara campus===
METU main campus in Ankara, used by the university since 1963, is the first university campus of Turkey. It is situated about 10 km west of central Ankara and encompasses an area of , of which constitute the METU Forest. The campus grounds was transformed into a forest with the continuing help of students and volunteers since the foundation of the university. The creation of this distinctive campus with its forest was spearheaded by the METU rector from 1961 to 1969, Kemal Kurdaş.

Lake Eymir near Gölbaşı, located 15 kilometers from the academic portion of the campus, is used by the students and faculty for rowing and recreational activities. The campus is accessible by several types of public transport, and the construction of METU subway station of the Ankara Metro on the main entrance to the campus (gate A1) was completed in 2014.


===Northern Cyprus campus===
The METU Northern Cyprus Campus, the first overseas campus of a Turkish university, 50 km west of North Nicosia in Northern Cyprus, admitted its first students during the academic year 2002–2003, but the doors were officially opened in Northern Cyprus in September 2005.

===Erdemli campus===
The METU Erdemli campus in Mersin Province on the Mediterranean coast, used by the Middle East Technical University Institute of Marine Sciences since 1975, is the first campus of METU outside of Ankara. It is situated about 45 km from Mersin. The campus area is 660,000 m2, close to the shore and surrounded by lemon trees. The laboratory space is about 700 m2. METU-IMS Harbor is an important shelter for marine biological diversity on the Mersin coast. The harbor is the only intact rocky habitat along the long sandy coast.

==METU Teknokent==
METU Teknokent, or ODTÜ Teknokent, is the first science and research park in Turkey. Founded within the campus, it aims to facilitate the development of companies that conduct substantial research and development to produce high-tech products and services through benefiting from METU&#x27;s research capacity and information pool. Priority is given to companies executing research and development work on information technologies, advanced materials, energy, automotive, chemistry, biology and environment technologies.

As of 2009, the METU Teknokent project employs about 3,300 personnel, approximately 2,700 of whom are researchers (86% of the total staff are university graduates, and 23% have MSc, MA, or PhD degrees), working in 240 firms. Around 90% of the firms are small and medium enterprises (SMEs), 65% of these are specialized in information and communication technologies, 25% in electronics, and 15% in other sectors such as aerospace, environment, bio-technology, nanotechnology, and advanced materials. The company profile also includes multinationals such as SBS, MAN, Cisco, and Siemens. To promote entrepreneurship and innovation, the incubation center at the METU Teknokent serves 38 start-ups and micro sized companies, most of which start their life as spin-offs from METU research projects.

METU Teknokent hosts partners to several European Union Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) projects, such as NICE, SINCERE, ReSIST, SmeInnov8gate and IP4INNO.

==Student life and culture==

The student life at METU is marked with activities of student societies, frequent political protests, and festivals. The Cultural and Convention Center continually hosts a wide spectrum of cultural events and also regular occurrences such as the METU Jazz Days and METU Art Festival. The event with the largest number of participants is the annual METU Spring Festival, a five-day-long series of open-air concerts and exhibitions held at the main campus.

There are various traits shared by METU students, including the usage of an English–Turkish jargon (METUrkish, ODTÜrkçe as once named by an alumnus artist in an art project) which apparently stems from the fact that English is the language of instruction covering academic processes and student life (and blending into campus language similar to Persian, Arabic and later French in the past blended into Turkish to form Ottoman technical language), which reputedly is not liked much by the students of other universities; and the omnipresent word &quot;&quot;Hocam&quot; (meaning &quot;My Teacher&quot;&quot;), which is used by METU students to address anyone from bus drivers to senior faculty members. Underneath this phrase lies the philosophy that everyone has something to learn from each other.

The main campus has dormitory capacity for nearly 7,000 students who benefit from the shopping center, banks, post office, and a wide variety of sports facilities, including gymnasiums, tennis courts, basketball and football fields, jogging trails, Olympic-size indoor swimming pool, and an outdoor swimming pool.

=== Student organizations ===
There are numerous student organizations active in METU. Some of these are:

===METU Pride march===
METU Pride march has been held annually since 2011. The 2022 Pride march was banned by the university, and the university threatened to summon police if it should proceed. The 9th annual Pride march held 2019 found students and faculty met with pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets used by police. Some were dragged on the ground and others sustained head injuries. 18 students and an academic were arrested and released late in the night on the same day. Following a letter from the Ankara Security Office, arrested students had their KYK scholarships and credits terminated. The arrested were prosecuted, and they were acquitted October 2021, with the university&#x27;s ban found lacking legal basis.

<doc id="515842" wikidata="Q6422540" url="?curid=515842" title="Knights of the White Camelia">
<text>The Knights of the White Camelia was an American white supremacist organization that operated in the Southern United States in the late 19th century. Similar to and associated with the Ku Klux Klan, it opposed freedmen&#x27;s rights.

==History==
The Knights of the White Camelia (named for the camellia, a type of flower) was founded by Confederate States Army Colonel, Alcibiades DeBlanc, on May 22, 1867, in Franklin, Louisiana. Author Christopher Long stated, &quot;Its members were pledged to support the supremacy of the White race, to oppose the amalgamation of the races, to resist the social and political encroachment of the so-called carpetbaggers, and to restore White control of the government&quot;. Historian Nicholas Lemann calls the Knights the leading terrorist organization in Louisiana. Their tactics, (which included &quot;harassment, floggings, and sometimes murder&quot;) &quot;produced a reign of terror among the state&#x27;s black population during the summer and fall of 1868.&quot; The estimated death toll of their terror campaign may have been as large as 1,800 people, with an even larger number being wounded by them. The double murder of pro-Republican Judge Valentine Chase and Sheriff Henry H. Pope of St. Mary Parish may have been committed by them.

Chapters primarily existed in the southern part of the Deep South. Historian George C. Rable noted that, &quot;Although the Republicans saw evidence of a massive conspiracy in these outrages, in Louisiana as elsewhere, White terrorists were not organized beyond the local level.&quot; An additional aim of the group was to keep Freedmen farm labor from leaving the plantations. Unlike the Ku Klux Klan, which drew much of its membership from lower-class Southerners (primarily Confederate veterans), the White Camelia consisted mainly of upper-class Southerners, including physicians, landowners, newspaper editors, and officers. They were also usually Confederate veterans, the upper part of antebellum society. It began to decline, despite a convention in 1869. The more aggressive people joined the White League or similar paramilitary organizations that organized in the mid-1870s. By 1870, the original Knights of the White Camelia had mostly ceased to exist. Among its members was Louisiana Judge Taylor Beattie, who led the Thibodaux massacre of 1887.

==Legacy==
In 1939, &quot;Time&quot; reported that the Minnesotan anti-Semite George E. Deatherage was describing himself as the &quot;national commander of the Knights of the White Camellia&quot;. In the 1990s, a Ku Klux Klan group which was based in eastern Texas adopted the name. According to the book &quot;Soldiers of God&quot;, the new age White Camelia has a strong influence in Vidor, Texas. Ever since the return of the White Camelia name, so-called &quot;White Camelia&quot; (sometimes spelled Kamelia) Klan groups have also emerged in Louisiana and Florida.

<doc id="515844" wikidata="Q550548" url="?curid=515844" title="Eddie the Eagle">
<text>Michael David Edwards (born 5 December 1963), better known as Eddie the Eagle, is an English ski jumper and Olympian who in 1988 became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping, finishing last in the Normal Hill and Large Hill events. He held the British ski jumping record from 1988 to 2001. He also took part in amateur speed skiing, running at , and became a stunt jumping world record holder for jumping over 6 buses.

In 2016, he was portrayed by Taron Egerton and Tom and Jack Costello in the biographical film &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;.

==Early life==
Edwards was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His family calls him by his given name, Michael. &quot;Eddie&quot; is a nickname derived by schoolfriends from his surname. After a taste of skiing on a school trip aged 13, he developed his skills on dry slopes, then worked for a season at Glenshee in Scotland. Having not made the grade as a downhill skier, he switched to ski jumping as there were no other British ski jumpers with whom to compete for a place.

==Ski jumping career==
===Early jumping===
Edwards began jumping under the supervision of John Viscome and Chuck Berghorn in Lake Placid, New York, using Berghorn&#x27;s equipment, although he had to wear six pairs of socks to make the boots fit. He was disadvantaged by his weight—at about , more than heavier than the next heaviest competitor—and by his lack of financial support for training, being totally self-funded. Another problem was that he was very far-sighted, wearing thick glasses under his goggles, which would mist up at altitude.

Edwards first represented Great Britain at the 1987 World Championships in Oberstdorf in Bavaria, West Germany, and was ranked 55th in the world. This performance qualified him as the sole British applicant for the 1988 Winter Olympics ski jumping competition. He received confirmation of his qualification for the games while working as a plasterer and temporarily residing in a Finnish mental hospital, due to lack of funds for alternative accommodation rather than as a patient.

===1988 Winter Olympics===
During the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary Edwards competed in and finished last in both the 70 m and 90 m events. In the 70 m, he scored 69.2 points from two jumps of 61.0 m; second-last Bernat Solà Pujol of Spain scored 140.4 points from 71 m and 68.5 m jumps; winner Matti Nykänen of Finland had 229.1 points from 89.5 m jumps. In the 90 m, Edwards scored 57.5 points from 71 m and 67 m jumps; third-last Todd Gilman of Canada had 110.8 points from 96 m and 86.5 m; Nykänen won again, with 224 points from 118.5 m and 107 m.

From the beginning, the press version of his story was &quot;embroidered with falsehoods&quot;. Edwards commented, &quot;They said I was afraid of heights. But I was doing sixty jumps a day then, which is hardly something someone who was afraid of heights would do.&quot;

His lack of success endeared him to people around the globe. He subsequently became a media celebrity and appeared on talk shows around the world, appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during the Games. The press nicknamed him &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, and one Italian journalist called him a &quot;ski dropper&quot;.

At the closing ceremony, the president of the Organising Committee, Frank King, singled out Edwards for his contribution. King said, addressing the competitors, &quot;You have broken world records and you have established personal bests. Some of you have even soared like an eagle.&quot;

====&quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot; Rule====
Following the widespread attention that Edwards received in Calgary shortly after the Olympics finished, the entry requirements were made stricter, making it nearly impossible for anyone to follow his example: the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instituted what became known as the Eddie the Eagle Rule, which requires Olympic hopefuls to compete in international events and be placed in the top 30 percent or the top 50 competitors, whichever is fewer.

Edwards failed to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, or the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. He got a five-year sponsorship from Eagle Airlines, a small British charter company, to support his attempt to reach the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, but failed to qualify for those as well.

===Return to Calgary and other media appearances===
On 13 February 2008, Edwards made a return visit to Calgary to take part in festivities marking the twentieth anniversary of the Games. During his visit, he rode the zip-line at Canada Olympic Park with a member of the Jamaican bobsled team (the ride simulates the speed of a ski jumper) and led a procession of skiers down the slopes of the park while carrying an Olympic torch.

Edwards was chosen as a torchbearer in the relay for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. He ran with the torch on 7 January 2010 in Winnipeg.

Edwards released a book (and a video) called &quot;On the Piste&quot;. 
In 1991, he recorded a single in Finnish entitled &quot;Mun nimeni on Eetu&quot; (&quot;My name is Eetu&quot;), B-sided with &quot;Eddien Siivellä&quot; (&quot;On Eddie&#x27;s Wing&quot;), though he does not speak Finnish. Edwards learned the lyrics phonetically and the song reached No. 2 in the Finnish charts. &quot;Mun nimeni on Eetu&quot; was written by Finnish singer Irwin Goodman.

Edwards appeared in a number of advertising campaigns, e.g. on television, promoting cars, and commanded fees of £10,000 an hour. Nevertheless, he declared bankruptcy in 1992, claiming that a trust fund for his earnings was not set up properly. In 2003, he graduated from De Montfort University in Leicester with a degree in law. &quot;I&#x27;ve been interested in law since taking out a civil action against my trustees 10 years ago&quot;, he said in an interview in 2001.

On 25 February 2012, he appeared as a competitor on episode 2 of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Sport Relief, 2012&quot; and got through to the final on most public votes. His performances were accompanied by the Royal British Legion Band &amp; Corps of Drums Romford.

In 2013, he won the first series of the British celebrity diving programme &quot;Splash!&quot;, mentored by Tom Daley.

In January 2014, he commentated on the Channel 4 TV programme &quot;The Jump&quot;, where 12 famous people took part in winter sports. As part of each episode, Edwards jumped off the largest of three ski jumps. In the same year, he appeared as a guest on the ITV2 comedy show &quot;Fake Reaction&quot;.
In 2017, he returned to the ski jumping facilities at Canada Olympic Park, where he had taken part in the Olympics in 1988, to make some jumps that were his first in over 15 years.

In 2024, he appeared as a contestant on the sixteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. Edwards was brought in as a replacement after Stephen Lustig-Webb was forced to withdraw from the series.

==Biopic==

A biopic chronicling the life story of Edwards had been planned by Irish director Declan Lowney since 2007. Comedian Steve Coogan was originally chosen for the title role, but in 2009 Lowney announced that Rupert Grint would instead play the part. The film was scheduled to begin production once Grint completed work on &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;, but did not go ahead.

In March 2015, it was announced that 20th Century Fox had acquired the film, with Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman starring and Dexter Fletcher directing, from a screenplay by Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton. Egerton would portray the adult Eddie &quot;The Eagle&quot; Edwards, Tom and Jack Costello younger versions of Edwards, while Jackman would portray his coach, Bronson Peary. It was later announced that Christopher Walken had also joined the film, portraying the role of Bronson Peary&#x27;s mentor.

The film, &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;, was released in early 2016 and grossed a worldwide total of $46.1 million. In the UK, it grossed $12.8m, making it the highest grossing British film of 2016. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 82% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.

<doc id="515846" wikidata="Q2463185" url="?curid=515846" title="Carmela Soprano">
<text>Carmela Soprano (&quot;née&quot; DeAngelis), played by Edie Falco, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. She is married to Mafia boss Tony Soprano. A young Carmela, portrayed by Lauren DiMario, appears in the 2021 prequel film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;. She&#x27;s known for her strength, intelligence, and conflicted feelings about her marriage and lifestyle.

Edie Falco&#x27;s performance as Carmela was universally lauded. She won three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1999, 2001 and 2003, and received six nominations for her role in the series. Falco has also won two Golden Globe Awards and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Character biography==
Carmela was Tony Soprano&#x27;s high school sweetheart, and the couple married at a young age. They have two children together: Meadow Soprano and Anthony &quot;A.J.&quot; Soprano, Jr. In &quot;The Knight in White Satin Armor&quot;, Tony mentions that they have been married for 18 years, suggesting they were married around 1981 or 1982. Carmela attended Montclair State University for an unspecified period of time before dropping out.

Carmela is a homemaker for the Soprano household, and works to create a semblance of legitimacy for her family, even though she is well aware their wealth is built on &quot;blood money&quot;. Tony trusts Carmela enough to confide in her, to a degree, about some of his Mafia dealings, notably the failed attempt on his life and the death of Richie Aprile.

Carmela is an observant Roman Catholic and has difficulty rationalizing her husband&#x27;s profession and the flaws in their marriage. Tony and Carmela often reconcile after Tony presents her with expensive gifts, notably jewelry, designer clothing, furs, cars, and a $600,000 plot of land she wants to build a spec house on.
Sometimes, Carmela has intense guilt for having sacrificed her children&#x27;s security for the luxuries Tony&#x27;s career could provide. She defends her children from Tony when they do something wrong. She has shown herself willing to use her mob-wife status to intimidate others, as she does in Full Leather Jacket. In the episode, she overtly manipulates her neighbor&#x27;s Georgetown-alumna sister into writing a letter of recommendation for Meadow to Georgetown, hoping Meadow would not go to UC Berkeley but rather stay closer to home. She discards a letter from Berkeley to Meadow requesting transcripts. Later, she retrieves it from the trash in a moment of guilt.

While she is very proud of Meadow&#x27;s accomplishments and ambition, Carmela is also jealous and resentful of her daughter for achieving the independence and success she always wanted herself. She constantly frets over A.J.&#x27;s troubles and inactivity, yet tends to coddle him and is unwilling to impose any real restrictions on him. She has trouble with her husband&#x27;s profession, considering him more a Robin Hood-like character and just another &quot;crook&quot; rather than a brutal murderer.

Carmela&#x27;s resentment of her husband&#x27;s infidelity has often driven her to the brink of breaking her marriage vows during some sexually charged moments with her priest, Father Phil Intintola (in &quot;College&quot;), and painter-decorator Vic Musto. During the fourth season, Carmela has a mutual romantic infatuation with Furio Giunta. Tony had secured Furio from the Camorra clan while on an inaugural trip to Naples, the Soprano family&#x27;s ancestral homeland, a trip that Carmela had wanted to be a part of.

Carmela reaches a low point with Tony&#x27;s constant string of affairs and the two have a romantically tense but &quot;arms-length&quot; relationship for a period. Each confides to separate friends that they are falling for each other but Furio, who is no longer able to bear the burden that the internal conflict is causing him, that of his feelings conflicting with his honor, as well as his respect for the &quot;family&quot; hierarchy, sells his house and moves back to Italy. Carmela was devastated, and eventually revealed her feelings for him in an argument with Tony, to which Tony replies &quot;If certain men see him, he&#x27;s a dead man.&quot;

By the end of the fourth season, Tony and Carmela separate after Tony&#x27;s former mistress Irina Peltsin calls the Soprano home, talks to A.J., and informs Carmela that Tony slept with Svetlana Kirilenko, Irina&#x27;s cousin and the former nurse of Livia Soprano. Carmela begins dating A.J.&#x27;s guidance counselor, Robert Wegler. She pursues divorce proceedings against Tony, but is drawn back to her husband by financial concerns and difficulties in rearing A.J., as well as a difficult breakup with Wegler, who accuses Carmela of using sex to manipulate him into giving A.J. special treatment in school.

At the end of the fifth season, Carmela agrees to reunite with Tony after he agrees to purchase a $600,000 investment property in Montville, under Carmela&#x27;s name, so she could build a spec house. Despite some initial awkwardness, the two are firmly reunited after Tony is shot by his uncle, Junior, both during his coma and after his hospital release. The crisis seems to have strengthened their bond.

Carmela&#x27;s corrupt, materialistic nature is never far from the surface. After Tony surprises his delighted wife with a Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Carmela proceeds to flaunt her new SUV in front of Ginny Sack and Angie Bonpensiero, both of whom were reported to be having serious financial problems. Carmela is somewhat embarrassed when Angie admires Carmela&#x27;s SUV and tells her that she recently purchased a Corvette with her own money, showing that Angie has achieved a certain level of financial independence and Carmela has not.

Carmela&#x27;s own efforts to become financially independent have been less successful, as Tony neglects to intervene for a long period when an inspector determines that materials used on her spec house are not up to code, thereby halting construction and straining her relationship with her father, who was building the house with her. Tony later recants, and orders Silvio Dante to lean on the inspector to change his mind. Around this time, Carmela is concerned for the whereabouts of Adriana La Cerva, who seemingly had disappeared.

Carmela&#x27;s concern intensifies when she encountered Adriana&#x27;s mother, Liz La Cerva, at the Feast of St. Elzear (Episode 74, &quot;The Ride&quot;). Liz, who has stopped taking care of herself, tells Carmela that Adriana is dead, and that Christopher is responsible, going on to say the FBI told her so. The next day Carmela confronts Tony, who dismisses her: &quot;Let me school you on domestic violence,&quot; he says. &quot;First and foremost, there is always a body.&quot;

Carmela is not aware that Adriana was a low-level informant for the FBI and that Christopher, who had learned this truth from Adriana herself, informed Tony, who in turn had her executed by Silvio (in &quot;Long Term Parking&quot;). She is unaware that Tony murdered Christopher after he had flipped off the highway in the SUV in which both were traveling (in &quot;Kennedy and Heidi&quot;).

Carmela becomes greatly concerned for A.J. after he tries to commit suicide and is subsequently placed in the psychiatric ward at Mountainside Hospital. Carmela, along with Tony, encourages A.J. to become part of the production team for a film written by Daniel Baldwin and financed by Little Carmine, rather than enlist in the Army. She is shown considering building plans for a beach house. In the final scene of the series, she meets Tony at a diner for a family meal.

<doc id="515848" wikidata="Q2462411" url="?curid=515848" title="Frenulum of labia minora">
<text>The frenulum of labia minora (fourchette or posterior commissure of the labia minora) is a frenulum where the labia minora meet posteriorly.

==Pathology==
The fourchette may be torn during delivery due to the sudden stretching of the vulval orifice, or during copulation. To prevent this tearing in a haphazard manner, obstetricians and, less frequently, midwives may perform an episiotomy, which is a deliberate cut made in the perineum starting from the fourchette and continuing back along the perineum toward the anus. Sometimes this surgical cut may extend to involve the perineal body and thus reduce anal sphincter function. Thus some obstetricians have opted to perform a posterior-lateral cut in the perineum to prevent this potential complication from occurring.

The fourchette may also be torn in acts of violence wherein forced entry occurs such as rape. When the fourchette is torn, the bleeding which ensues sometimes requires surgical suturing for containment.

==Etymology==
The fourchette is named with the French word for &quot;fork&quot; or &quot;wishbone&quot;, owing to its shape. (See frenulum for its etymology.)

<text>The Boston Latin School is a public exam school in Boston, Massachusetts. It was established on April 23, 1635, making it the oldest public school in colonial-era British America and the oldest existing school in the United States.

==History==

Boston Latin School was founded on April 23, 1635, by the Town of Boston. The school was modeled after the Free Grammar School of Boston in England under the influence of Reverend John Cotton. The first classes were held in the home of the Master, Philemon Pormort. John Hull was the first student to graduate (1637). It was intended to educate young men of all social classes in the classics. The school was initially funded by donations and land rentals rather than by taxes. A school established in nearby Dedham was the first tax-supported public school.

Latin is the mother of modern Romance languages and was an educational priority in the 17th century. The ability to read at least Cicero and Virgil was a requirement of all colonial colleges, and to write and speak Latin in verse and prose was the first of the “Harvard College Laws” of 1642. Boston Latin prepared many students for admission to Harvard, with a total of seven years devoted to the classics. However, most graduates of Boston Latin did not go on to college, since business and professions did not require college training.

A cadet corps was founded during the American Civil War and was disbanded in the early 1960s.

Boston Latin has produced four Harvard University presidents, four Massachusetts governors, and five signers of the United States Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin and Louis Farrakhan are among its well-known dropouts.

Until the 19th century, the Latin School admitted only male students and hired only male teachers. Helen Magill White was the school&#x27;s first female graduate and the first American woman to earn a doctorate. Magill White was the only female pupil at the school when she attended. Later, the Girls&#x27; Latin School was founded in 1877. Boston Latin admitted its first co-educational class in 1972.

The school appointed Marie Frisardi Cleary and Juanita Ponte as the first two women in its academic faculty in 1967. Cornelia Kelley was the school&#x27;s first female headmaster, serving from 1998 until her retirement in 2007, after which Lynne Mooney Teta became headmaster. In 2016, Mooney Teta resigned amid a federal probe into racially charged incidents at the school. In 2017, Rachel Skerritt became the first person of color to serve as headmaster. Skerritt resigned at the conclusion of the 2021-22 school year and was succeeded in the retitled position of Head of School by elementary principal and fellow Latin School alumnus Jason Gallagher.

==Academics==
Boston Latin&#x27;s motto is &quot;Sumus Primi&quot;, Latin for &quot;we are first&quot;. This has a double meaning, referring both to the school&#x27;s date of founding and to its academic stature. Boston Latin has a history of pursuing the same standards as elite New England prep schools while adopting the egalitarian attitude of a public school. Academically, the school regularly outperforms public schools in affluent Boston suburbs, particularly as measured by the yearly MCAS assessment required of all Massachusetts public schools. In 2006, Brooklyn Latin School was founded in New York City, explicitly modeled on Boston Latin, borrowing much from its traditions and curriculum. In 2006, Washington Latin School was founded in Washington DC, also modeled on Boston Latin.

===Admissions===
Admission to Boston Latin School is limited to residents of the city of Boston. Until 2020, admission was determined by a combination of a student&#x27;s score on the Independent School Entrance Examination (ISEE) and recent grades. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the entrance exam was suspended, and admission was based on grades and Boston residency. In 2021, a new exam, the MAP Growth test, was designated for students applying for entrance to the 2023-24 school year and beyond. Students must have a grade point average from their current and previous school years of at least a B to be eligible to apply. In addition to GPA and test scores, students may be eligible to receive additional points if they meet specific criteria, such as living in housing owned by the Boston Housing Authority, in the care of the Department of Children and Families, or experiencing homelessness. They also receive additional points if they attended a school in the year prior to application that has, on average over the past five years, an enrollment of 40% or more economically disadvantaged students. 

Although Boston Latin runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it admits students only into the 7th and 9th grades.

The school has been the subject of controversy concerning its admissions process. Before the 1997 school year, Boston Latin set aside a 35% quota of places in the incoming class for under-represented minorities. The school was forced to drop this policy after a series of lawsuits were brought by white females who were not admitted despite ranking higher (based on test scores and GPA) than admitted minorities.

After the lawsuits, the percentage of under-represented minorities at Boston Latin fell from 35% in 1997 to under 19% in 2005, despite efforts by Boston Latin, the Boston Public Schools, and the Boston Latin School Association to recruit more minority applicants and retain more minority students.

Boston Latin later defeated a legal effort to end its admissions process entirely in favor of admissions by blind lottery.

In recent years, the admissions exam has continued to cause controversy due to the lack of diversity among admitted students. In 2017, Lawyers for Civil Rights published the demographics of the incoming class, highlighting that Black students are invited to attend Boston Latin at a rate that is more than two and a half times lower than their enrollment rates in Boston Public Schools overall.

The following year in 2018, Harvard Kennedy School released a brief explaining possible reasons for the racial gap in Boston Latin School’s admissions. Among the reasons are the lower rates of participation in the ISEE by Black and Hispanic students, lower ISEE scores due to inequitable curriculum and resources in the schools from which these students come, reported GPA differences, and less likelihood of Black and Hispanic students to list Boston Latin School as their top choice in school placement forms.

In 2019, Lawyers for Civil Rights, alongside the Boston chapter of the NAACP, sent a letter to Mayor Walsh, the Boston School Committee, and the superintendent, seeking to redo the admissions policies for Boston Latin School. The organizations cited the disproportionate admission rates of Black and Hispanic students versus white students as a failure of the exam system, and asked for a process that would diversify the school and take into account a student&#x27;s personal achievements.

The Educational Records Bureau (ERB), the organization responsible for creating and updating the ISEE, reportedly decided to end its yearly contract with the Boston Public Schools (BPS) in April 2019. In an email sent to the school district and other clients, ERB claimed that the test’s scoring metric had been incorrectly applied by BPS, resulting in underrepresented race groups failing to be admitted. BPS, however, denied that ERB cut business ties with the school district. BPS claimed instead that it had ended the contract in search of a test enabling “more equitable access” to the exam schools.

In October 2020, the Boston School Committee voted to cancel entrance exams for the city’s three exam schools in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The School Committee opted for an admissions procedure under which 20% of the incoming class would be accepted based on top grades, and the other 80% based on grades and zip codes. Students coming from zip codes with lower-income communities would receive preferential treatment.

Boston Latin School has received backlash from some parents because of this decision. Opponents of the proposed admissions system created a Change.org petition, garnering almost 6,000 signatures. The petition, directed to Boston City Council, argued that cancelling the test would increase disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A protest was held prior to the vote on the steps of Boston Latin School. One common concern surrounded Chinatown students potentially being excluded based on Chinatown’s surrounding area being rapidly gentrified, thus increasing the median income.

===Curriculum===

Declamation is one of the school&#x27;s time-honored traditions. Students in the 7th through 10th grades are required to give an oration, known as declamation, in their English class three times during the year. The school also holds Public Declamation, in which students from all grades are welcomed to try out for the chance to declaim a memorized piece in front of an assembly. During Public Declamation, declaimers are scored on categories including &quot;Memorization,&quot; &quot;Presentation,&quot; and &quot;Voice and Delivery,&quot; and those who score well in three of the first four public declamations are given the chance to declaim in front of alumni judges for awards in &quot;Prize Declamation.”

In addition to declamation in English classes, the Modern Languages department holds an annual &quot;World Language Declamation&quot; competition. Once a year, during National Foreign Language Week (usually the first week of March), students in grades 8 through 12 perform orations in languages other than English. Entrants are categorized by level, rather than language. So all students declaiming at the first-year level of various languages are competing against each other, all students declaiming at the second-year level compete against each other, and so on.

In 2001, the school decided to decrease the Latin requirement by one year, starting with the class of 2006. For students admitted for 7th grade, the minimum number of years of Latin required decreased from five years to four years, and for students admitted for 9th grade, from four years to three years. Students, however, can still take Latin (and Greek) electives after their fourth year.

==Publications==
There are currently three main publications of the Boston Latin School: &quot;The Register&quot; is the school&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;The Argo&quot; the school newspaper, and &quot;Catapulta&quot; is the school science magazine. George Santayana founded &quot;The Register&quot; in 1881 to serve as the school newspaper. Over the years, however, it evolved into a purely literary magazine, publishing prose and poetry written by members of the student body, as well as artwork. There are generally three editors-in-chief, and it is published twice per year. &quot;The Argo&quot;, the school&#x27;s newspaper, is far younger, having been founded in 1970 after it was clear that the &quot;Register&quot; had become a purely literary magazine. As of the 2006–2007 school year, it is published seven times a year. &quot;Catapulta&quot;, the science magazine, highlights popular and recent science and technology and is generally published four times a year. The &quot;Register&quot;, the &quot;Argo&quot;, and &quot;Catapulta&quot; are entirely student-produced, and the &quot;Argo&quot; and the &quot;Register&quot; have won awards from the New England Scholastic Press Association, while &quot;Catapulta&quot; has won awards from the American Scholastic Press Association.

Another Boston Latin publication is &quot;BLSA Bulletin&quot;, published by the Boston Latin School Association, whose president is Peter G. Kelly, &#x27;83.

==Athletics==

Boston Latin&#x27;s teams are known as the Boston Latin Wolfpack; their colors are purple and white. Boston Latin has played rival Boston English in football every Thanksgiving since 1887, the oldest continuous high school rivalry in the United States.

In 2024, the Boys&#x27; Ice Hockey Team entered the state playoffs as the 11th seed and completed a magical Cinderella run by defeating the 10th, 6th, 3rd, and 1st ranked teams in the MIAA Division 2 on the way to winning the State Championship.

==In popular culture==
* April 5, 2000: In &quot;Six Meetings Before Lunch&quot;, a first-season episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Rob Lowe&#x27;s character Sam Seaborn mentioned Boston Latin School in a discussion of public school reform and school vouchers in American public education. He said, “Boston Latin, the oldest public school in America, is still the best secondary school in New England.” Mallory O&#x27;Brien replies &quot;They all can&#x27;t be Boston Latin and Bronx Science.&quot;
* January 8, 2002: President George W. Bush visited the Boston Latin School after signing the No Child Left Behind Act earlier that day.
* January 22, 2007: In Season 1, Episode 12 of &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, Matthew Perry&#x27;s character Matt Albie mentioned that his nephew had a 3.8 GPA at Boston Latin.

==Rankings and awards==
In 2007, the school was named one of the top 20 high schools in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; magazine. It was named a 2011 &quot;Blue Ribbon School of Excellence&quot;, the Department of Education&#x27;s highest award. As of 2018, it is listed under the &quot;gold medal&quot; list, ranking 48 out of the top 100 high schools in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

In 2019, the school was rated as the top high school in the Boston area by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and number 33 in national rankings.

==Alumni==
Boston Latin has graduated notable Americans in the fields of politics (both local and national), religion, science, journalism, philosophy, and music. Of the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence, five were educated at Latin: Adams, Franklin, Hancock, Hooper, and Paine. Graduates and students fought in the Revolutionary War, American Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, and the Vietnam War, and plaques and statues in the school building honor those who died.

===Hall of Fame===
The Hall of Fame, known casually as &quot;The Wall,&quot; refers to the upper frieze in the school&#x27;s auditorium, where the last names of famous alumni are painted. These names include Adams, Bernstein, Fitzgerald, Franklin, Hancock, Hooper, John Hull, Kennedy, Mather, Paine, Quincy, Santayana, Winthrop and others. The most recent name, Wade McCree Jr., was added to the frieze in 1999, and the selection of the name involved a conscious effort to choose a graduate of color. There are no names of female graduates, mostly because women have attended the school for just 46 years and the honor is only bestowed posthumously. There is also a lower frieze with the names of many other distinguished graduates, and a place on the lower frieze can be awarded while the person is still alive.

<doc id="515869" wikidata="Q2456679" url="?curid=515869" title="Meadow Soprano">
<text>Meadow Mariangela Soprano, portrayed by Jamie-Lynn Sigler, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. In the early seasons, Meadow is introduced as a smart but spoiled partygoer, whose over-dramatic personality and tendency of living in a state of denial reveal a somewhat troubled upbringing. In the later seasons, her character developed with her understanding of the realities of life, money, politics, and relationships. The stark contrast to her brother A.J., she is an achiever in the family and the source of pride for her parents. Her growth would foreshadow that of her younger brother, A.J played by Robert Iler.

In 1997, Sigler was cast as Meadow Soprano. When her manager first told her about the audition for &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Sigler thought she would have to sing as a soprano.

==Fictional biography==

Born on September 13, 1982, Meadow is the first-born child of Tony, played by James Gandolfini, and Carmela Soprano, played by Edie Falco. She was active in extracurricular activities in high school, playing on the championship girls&#x27; soccer team, and singing in the chorus and school pageants. She became a member of the National Honor Society and attended Columbia University. Due to all these accomplishments and extracurriculars, she is praised by both Tony and Carmela which causes tension between her and her brother A.J since she is clearly the favorite child of Tony and Carmela.

After struggling through her first year at Columbia University, she volunteered regularly at the South Bronx Law Center.

Her employment there added to the friction between Meadow and her father relating to race relations, specifically with regard to Tony&#x27;s racist attitude towards Black people. After graduating, Meadow, who was interested in being a pediatrician, studied for medical school. She had second thoughts and later considered a career in the legal profession.

Meadow was often resentful of her lineage, stemming from a string of failed relationships, beginning with a fellow Columbia student named Noah Tannenbaum. Due to his mixed racial parentage from an African American mother and a Jewish father, Noah was met with Tony&#x27;s racist disapproval and broke up with Meadow after his own father seemed disconcerted with Tony&#x27;s occupation.

This was followed by a romance with Jackie Aprile Jr., the son of Tony&#x27;s deceased friend and fellow mobster, Jackie Aprile Sr. Meadow fell in love with Jackie Jr., but their temporary happiness together ended when he cheated on her and became increasingly involved in organized crime. Jackie ultimately organized a robbery involving a card game in which one man was killed and two others wounded.

After this incident, and following Tony&#x27;s instructions to make a timely resolution to the matter, Ralph Cifaretto decided to kill Jackie Jr. As Jackie was exiting his hiding place, Vito Spatafore came up behind him and shot him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. The hit was publicized as a drug deal with African Americans gone bad, a story which Meadow publicly accepted, though she privately surmised that Jackie was killed by the mob. Her acceptance of his murder spiraled into problems elsewhere, as she struggled with depression and used alcohol and drugs while a college freshman.

Just before Jackie Jr.&#x27;s death, Meadow came to realize that he was unfaithful, but his death was nevertheless distressing. She initially blamed Tony for Jackie&#x27;s involvement with crime and Carmela for standing by and supporting Tony. Unbeknownst to Meadow, it was Tony that had attempted to discourage Jackie&#x27;s mafia aspirations, having promised Jackie Sr. on his deathbed to see that Jackie Jr. stayed away from the mob life.

During her teens, Meadow was both very aware and resentful of her father&#x27;s criminal enterprise and her family&#x27;s complicity therein. Meadow reconciled herself with these facts and her attitude strongly mirrored Tony&#x27;s own. Publicly, she cited her father&#x27;s position as a &quot;waste management consultant,&quot; but in closer circles, she rationalized the Mafia as a cultural tradition borne out of discrimination against her ancestors&#x27; social and ethnic origins. Her life seemed further stabilized by her engagement to a Columbia dental student, Finn DeTrolio, of which her father approved. It was later revealed that Finn and Meadow broke off the engagement.

At the film premiere for &quot;Cleaver&quot;, Meadow reunited with Patrick Parisi, the son of Patsy Parisi, one of Tony&#x27;s soldiers. Meadow and Patrick began seriously dating. Inspired by Patrick&#x27;s passion for the law, Meadow decided to not apply to medical school and go to law school instead. She began to plan her wedding with Patrick.

In the series&#x27; final scene, she is shown outside the diner where she arrived late for meeting her family for dinner. She makes a number of efforts to parallel park before she succeeds and heads toward the diner. In the final shot of the series, Tony looks up after hearing the restaurant door open.

In Tony&#x27;s coma, she is voiced by Morgan Saylor.

<text>Anthony John Soprano Jr. is a fictional character on the HBO television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, portrayed by Robert Iler. He is the son of Carmela and Tony Soprano and the younger brother of Meadow Soprano.

==Biography==

Anthony was born July 15, 1986, and is the younger child of Tony and Carmela Soprano. Unlike his older sister, AJ is a chronic underachiever with moderate self-esteem issues. During his high school years, he began developing a rebellious streak that leads him to crashing his mother&#x27;s car, smoking marijuana at his own confirmation, getting drunk on stolen communion wine, vandalizing his school&#x27;s swimming pool, and getting expelled from school after cheating on a test. As Tony and Carmela get to their wits end with his antics, they decide to send him to military school to teach him tough love and discipline, but after learning he gets panic attacks just like Tony, they decide to keep him in public school by sending him to another school, but keep a closer eye on him. 

In the episode D-Girl, after reading &quot;The Stranger&quot; and Friedrich Nietzsche, AJ states that &quot;God is dead&quot; and that he does not want to get confirmed. Despite his objections, he receives his confirmation. In the episode Pie-O-My, he is heard listening to &quot;The Gift That Keeps On Giving&quot;, a song about accepting the word of Satan, by &quot;Deicide&quot;, an anti-Christian Satanist death metal band that is named after deicide, the act of killing a god. 

Despite all of his troubles, AJ is a spoiled child. In the episode &quot;Two Tonys&quot;, it is revealed that Tony bought him an elaborate $5,000 drum set. Additionally, in the episode &quot;All Happy Families...&quot;, Tony gets him an almost new Nissan Xterra as a &quot;motivational tool&quot;. A.J. is excited about the SUV, however, he comments about the environmental impact of the car, and also states he may encounter social pressure from school friends to drive a different vehicle.

During the fifth season, A.J. shows an increasing amount of disrespect to his mother, presumably due to his parents&#x27; separation. He tends to relate better to his father, and ends up moving in with him during the separation. However, in the episode &quot;Sentimental Education&quot;, A.J. and Tony get into a scuffle over A.J.&#x27;s lack of respect. A.J. soon decides he wants to move back in with his mother, threatening to call social services due to the ongoing &quot;violence against children&quot; present in his father&#x27;s home. Carmela demands certain things from A.J. in return for allowing him to move back in (e.g., showing respect to his mother, not swearing, tending to schoolwork).

Frequently throughout the series, Tony and Carmela express concern about A.J.&#x27;s future. Tony has no desire to offer his son a position in the mafia. In the fifth season of the show, A.J. displays an unexpected interest in pursuing a career in event planning, but later derides his parents&#x27; mentions of it (e.g., in &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Sacrimoni Request...&quot;).

In &quot;Full Leather Jacket&quot;, A.J. says that he wants to go to Harvard University or West Point for college. Tony dismisses the idea as unrealistic given A.J.&#x27;s poor academic performance. During Season 3, when Tony asks him about it at a family dinner, A.J. claims that he never said that, as he knows his grades wouldn&#x27;t be good enough. Throughout Season 5, references are made to the unlikelihood of A.J.&#x27;s being admitted to a four-year university.

In Season 6A, A.J. admits to his parents that he has flunked out of the community college he was attending, a worrying parallel to Tony&#x27;s own youth. After a senile Uncle Junior mistakes Tony as an intruder and shoots him, A.J. steals a large knife and goes to the institution where Junior is being held, in a futile effort to exact revenge for his father. He is arrested, but later released without charges thanks to his father&#x27;s political connections. He delves deep into the New York City club scene and begins using cocaine.

After several days of Anthony&#x27;s claiming to be searching for jobs on the Internet to no avail, Tony intervenes and arranges a construction job for his son. A.J. claims he cannot do it because he will be trying again for community college, but Tony says that is not a problem as many of the men who work in construction are high school and college students. A.J. is reluctant to accept the job because of the early hours and outdoor work, which makes Tony angry.

Tony grabs a football helmet and smashes the windshield of A.J.&#x27;s Nissan Xterra, warning A.J. not to test him. A.J. reluctantly works at the construction site where he meets Blanca Selgado, who he soon begins dating. Carmela disapproves of Blanca, who is Dominican, 10 years A.J.&#x27;s senior, and has a three-year-old son named Hector. Tony is more approving of the relationship, commenting that at least Blanca is Catholic (like the Sopranos).

In Season 6B, A.J. proposes to Blanca at a fancy restaurant dinner, telling her that he will own a couple of restaurants in a couple of years. However, Blanca soon gives the ring back and breaks up with him, leaving A.J. severely depressed. His father tries to cheer him up, telling him there are many reasons he will meet other women and be successful in future relationships, including that he is smart, hard-working, and white, &quot;a huge plus nowadays&quot;.

He quits his job and mopes about until his father forces him to attend a fraternity party with the college-age relatives of his fellow mafiosi. A.J. grudgingly attends, and soon starts to enjoy himself. Several of the boys run a sports betting operation at the college and after a night of drinking, they beat and torture a college student who neglected to pay them by pouring battery acid on his foot. A.J. joins in to help forget his relationship problems. Later, he joins his new friends as they physically harass other students on campus. Afterwards, A.J. is seen telling his psychiatrist that he is once again depressed about the world due to that incident.

This depression leads to a botched suicide attempt, wherein A.J. ties a cinder block to his leg with a too-long length of rope and attempts to drown himself in the pool at the Soprano home. His father hears his cries for help and dives into the pool to rescue him. He is then placed in psychiatric care facility, where he meets Rhiannon, an ex-girlfriend of his former friend Hernan. After Tony tells him that his uncle Bobby has been shot dead, A.J. begins to cry and complain about how Bobby&#x27;s death negatively affects him. Tony loses patience with him, violently drags him out of his bed, slaps him around, and tells him to pack as the family leaves home quickly to elude a possible attack by the Lupertazzi family.

In the final episode, A.J. is in his Nissan Xterra with Rhiannon, his new girlfriend, and starts making out with her, but they both rush out of the vehicle when it catches fire due to A.J.&#x27;s parking it over a pile of leaves. After getting chewed out by Tony, A.J. decides to join the Army and begins vigorous training. This scares A.J.&#x27;s parents. Tony decides to sit down with A.J. and successfully talks him out of enlisting. Instead, Tony gets him a new BMW M3 and a job working for Little Carmine&#x27;s film production company. The new job, paired with the possibility of opening his own nightclub, seems to alleviate A.J.&#x27;s depression. He is seen having dinner with his family at last.

In all seasons, A.J. is portrayed as a fan of heavy metal and nu metal, via product placements (shirts, coats, posters and stickers) of bands like Pantera, Nevermore, Mudvayne (whose concert he attends in the episode &quot;All Happy Families&quot;), Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, Coal Chamber, Marilyn Manson, Stuck Mojo, Machine Head, Soulfly and Fear Factory. By the end of the series, having grown more worldly and introspective, he discovers and begins analyzing the early work of Bob Dylan. Through various plot points and pieces of clothing, A.J. is identified as a fan of the New York Giants, New Jersey Devils and New York/New Jersey MetroStars.

<doc id="515885" wikidata="Q1393718" url="?curid=515885" title="Haemophilia C">
<text>Haemophilia C(also known as plasma thromboplastin antecedent (PTA) deficiency or Rosenthal syndrome) is a mild form of haemophilia affecting both sexes, due to factor XI deficiency. It predominantly occurs in Ashkenazi Jews. It is the fourth most common coagulation disorder after von Willebrand&#x27;s disease and haemophilia A and B. In the United States, it is thought to affect 1 in 100,000 of the adult population, making it 10% as common as haemophilia A.

==Signs and symptoms==

In terms of the signs/symptoms of haemophilia C, unlike individuals with Haemophilia A and B, people affected by it are not ones to bleed spontaneously. In these cases, haemorrhages tend to happen after a major surgery or injury. However, people affected with haemophilia C might experience symptoms closely related to those of other forms of haemophilia such as the following:
==Cause==

Haemophilia C is caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor XI and is distinguished from haemophilia A and B by the fact it does not lead to bleeding into the joints. Because factor XI helps sustain the fibrin clot in the intrinsic clotting pathway and combat fibrinolysis, a deficiency in this factor contributes to abnormal bleeding patterns; however, the amount of excessive bleeding is variable among those with haemophilia C. Furthermore, it has autosomal recessive inheritance since the gene for factor XI is located on chromosome 4 (near the prekallikrein gene); and it is not completely recessive, individuals who are heterozygous also show increased bleeding.

Many mutations exist, and the bleeding risk is not always influenced by the severity of the deficiency. Haemophilia C is occasionally observed in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus, because of inhibitors to the FXI protein.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of haemophilia C (factor XI deficiency) is centered on prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). One will find that the factor XI has decreased in the individual&#x27;s body. In terms of differential diagnosis, one must consider: haemophilia A, haemophilia B, lupus anticoagulant and heparin contamination. The prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time should completely correct with a 1:1 mixing study with normal plasma if haemophilia C is present; in contrast, if a lupus anticoagulant is present as the cause of a prolonged aPTT, the aPTT will not correct with a 1:1 mixing study.

==Treatment==
In terms of haemophilia C medication tranexamic acid is often used for both treatment after an incident of bleeding and as a preventive measure to avoid excessive bleeding during oral surgery.

Treatment is usually unnecessary, except in relation to operations, leading to many of those having the condition not being aware of it. In these cases, fresh frozen plasma or recombinant factor XI may be used, but only if necessary.

Those affected may often develop nosebleeds, while females can experience unusual menstrual bleeding which can be avoided by taking birth control such as: IUDs and oral or injected contraceptives to increase coagulation ability by adjusting hormones to levels similar to pregnancy.

<doc id="515889" wikidata="Q115853" url="?curid=515889" title="Alexandra Nechita">
<text>Alexandra Nechita (born August 27, 1985) is a Romanian-American cubist painter and philanthropist. At age 12 she was dubbed the &quot;Petite Picasso&quot; by the media and the art community. She has been praised for her paintings and vision of art.

==Early life and education==
Nechita was born in Vaslui, three months after her father, Niki, escaped from Communist Romania. She and her mother, Viorica, had to wait two years before they were allowed to join him in the United States. The family settled in California, where her father found work as a lab technician and her mother as an office manager.

At the age of two, she was working with pen and ink, and by five with watercolors. By her seventh birthday, oil and acrylics were her tools. She had her first solo exhibition at age eight, at the public library in Whittier, Los Angeles County. At the time, she was a student at Orange Lutheran High School, a private school in Orange County. In 1995, at the age of ten, Nechita was taken to Paris to work at the Mourlot Studios. In the same year, she became the youngest artist to sign with International Art Publishers. When Nechita graduated, she gave her teachers a special painting that she had painted.

==Career==
By early 1996 Nechita had already delivered 16 solo exhibits of her paintings, and &quot;at least $1.5 million in sales.&quot; Nechita came to national attention in early 1997, when she was chosen to design the 39th Annual Grammy Awards Program. Nechita has been a guest on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and has appeared with numerous celebrities, including Bill Clinton. In addition to talk show appearances, she has played herself on the teen sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; in the 1998 episode &quot;Better Than The Average Cory&quot;. Her talent and perceived similarities to Pablo Picasso led to her being known as the &quot;Petite Picasso. She was known as a child prodigy until late in her teens, and routinely sold her paintings for $100,000 or more.

In November 1999, Nechita was selected by the World Federation of United Nations Associations to lead a Global Arts Initiative involving more than 100 nations. In 2005, Alexandra Nechita unveiled her United Nations Peace Monument for Asia in Singapore, to be displayed at the Catholic High School. Her artwork has been sold and displayed at various locations in the world and her collectors include Ellen DeGeneres, Alec Baldwin, Oprah Winfrey, Melissa Etheridge, Lee Iacocca, Calvin Klein, Whoopi Goldberg, Little Richard and Paul Stanley of the rock group Kiss. The theatre at her high school, Lutheran High School of Orange County is named after her.

Nechita is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

== Media ==
Nechita was interviewed by CNN&#x27;s Nicole Lapin on the series &quot;Young People Who Rock&quot; in November 2007. She has appeared on television news and talk shows around the world, including NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;CBS Sunday Morning.&quot; She also made a cameo appearance in an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Boy Meets World.&quot; She has received numerous awards and honors which include Outstanding Artist of the Year (Lincoln Center for Arts New York); Most Fascinating Woman of the Year (&quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal in conjunction with CBS TV&quot;); Outstanding Young person Award (Osaka, Japan); and Woman of the Year by the American Red Cross.

==Personal life==
She graduated from UCLA in 2008 with a degree in Fine Arts and currently lives in Los Angeles. In January 2014, she married longtime boyfriend Dimitry Tcharfas. She has a daughter and a son.

<doc id="515896" wikidata="Q2042081" url="?curid=515896" title="Octagon house">
<text>Octagon houses are eight-sided houses that were popular in the United States and Canada mostly in the 1850s. They are characterized by an octagonal (eight-sided) plan and often feature a flat roof and a veranda that circles the house. Their unusual shape and appearance, quite different from the ornate pitched-roof houses typical of the period, can generally be traced to the influence of amateur architect and lifestyle pundit Orson Squire Fowler. Although there are other octagonal houses worldwide, the term &quot;octagon house&quot; usually refers to octagonal houses built in North America during this period, and up to the early 1900s.

==History==
Early examples, before Fowler:
*Poplar Forest, Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s private retreat and plantation house near Lynchburg, Virginia.
*William Thornton&#x27;s John Tayloe III House, more commonly called The Octagon House in Washington, D.C. After the White House was burned by the British during the War of 1812, President James Madison stayed in the Octagon House, and it was here that the Treaty of Ghent (ending the War of 1812) was signed. It is now the headquarters of the American Institute of Architects. While known as &quot;The Octagon&quot;, it is worth noting that this particular building is not actually octagonal.

Both houses are large brick buildings in the classical tradition. They may be seen as precursors, but are somewhat different from the Victorian octagon houses which are essentially domestic structures.
==Orson Squire Fowler==

The leading proponent of octagonal houses was Orson Squire Fowler. Fowler was America&#x27;s foremost lecturer and writer on phrenology, the pseudoscience of defining an individual&#x27;s characteristics by the contours of the skull. In the middle of the 19th century, Fowler made his mark on American architecture when he touted the advantages of octagonal homes over rectangular and square structures in his widely publicized book, &quot;The Octagon House: A Home For All, or A New, Cheap, Convenient, and Superior Mode of Building&quot;, printed in the year 1848. As a result of this popular and influential publication, a few thousand octagonal houses were erected in the United States, mostly in the Midwest, the East Coast and in nearby parts of Canada.

Fowler was not a professional architect. 

===Advantages of the octagon plan===

According to Fowler, an octagon house was cheaper to build, allowed for additional living space, received more natural light, was easier to heat, and remained cooler in the summer. These benefits all derive from the geometry of an octagon: the shape encloses space efficiently, minimizing external surface area and consequently heat loss and gain, building costs etc. A circle is the most efficient shape, but difficult to build and awkward to furnish, so an octagon is a sensible approximation. Victorian builders were used to building 135° corners, as in the typical bay window, and could easily adapt to an octagonal plan.

===Design principles===
Fowler&#x27;s &quot;The Octagon House&quot; is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a pattern book but the popularity of the book lies in the way Fowler suggested some general principles, and encouraged readers to invent the details for themselves. Only a few examples are offered, and apart from plans, the book has only two illustrations.

Fowler first shows some methods of subdividing an octagonal floor plan. Next is &quot;Howland&#x27;s octagonal plan&quot;, a small house designed by &#x27;Messrs. Morgan and Brothers, architects&#x27; which is similar to the Norrish House illustrated below. There follows &quot;A description of the author&#x27;s own residence&quot;, now known as Fowler&#x27;s Folly, at Fishkill, of which more below. Finally, &quot;A superior plan for a good sized house&quot;, which is a development of the Fishkill plans, apparently proposed by his engraver. The main feature of his plans is a desire to eliminate unnecessary circulation space, sometimes to the point that the main staircase is inconvenient, and the external veranda is the best way to get around the house.

Other design proposals include:
* Flat roof to collect rainwater, with cisterns built-in to collect and distribute the water.
* Rainwater filtering, using filter beds made up of alternating layers of sand and activated charcoal.
* Central heating by distributing hot air from a furnace in the basement.
* Flues, air ducts and speaking tubes built into the thickness of walls.

Built examples vary greatly in how much of this influence is apparent. Although built in brick, the Watertown house featured in this article is an almost perfect embodiment of many of Fowler&#x27;s ideas.

===Masswall construction===
Stacked board construction was recommended in the first edition of &quot;A Home for All&quot; but the third edition of Fowler&#x27;s book, printed in 1853, had a new subtitle: &quot;A Home For All, or The Gravel Wall and Octagon Mode of Building&quot;, and was distinguished by Fowler&#x27;s enthusiasm for concrete construction. At the time concrete construction was not widely used as Portland cement was only recently discovered by a Mr. Goodrich of Janesville, Wisconsin. Fowler knew gravel and lime were available in unlimited quantities in the prairies and saw the &quot;gravel wall&quot; as offering a new, cheap and durable way of building. His house at Fishkill was built using concrete. The walls were built up a few feet at a time, by pouring a mixture of gravel and lime into timber shuttering. As the concrete cured, the shuttering could be taken down and moved up to the next level.

Modern concrete is made using Portland cement, not lime, but the main difference is the universal use of steel reinforcing bars, which greatly increase the strength of the material, and make it possible to build concrete beams and floor slabs as well as walls. Fowler used large stones to reinforce corners, but he used no other reinforcement, and was therefore restricted to walls. The roof, floors and verandas are all of timber construction.
===Fowler&#x27;s Folly===
To quote Fowler &quot;...those studies which have eventuated in this work were instituted primarily in order to erect this very house&quot;. Construction began in 1848, the same year his book was first published, and took five years to complete. The house was large, to each side of the octagon or across, and built on a hilltop overlooking the Hudson River, where it could be seen for miles around. Fowler removed the top of the hill to create a level site and to provide material for his &quot;gravel walls&quot;. This grand residence had four huge reception rooms which could be interconnected depending on the size of event, allegedly 60 rooms (counting small dressing rooms as well as proper rooms) and a glazed cupola rising to above ground. Fowler&#x27;s favorite writing room was an internal room on the third floor, lit only from the cupola via a fanlight over the door. The house had no central staircase, so visitors entered one of the main rooms through a small lobby, while family and staff used the basement entrance. There are verandas all round the house at first-, second- and third-floor levels, linked by two outside stairs.

The financial panic of 1857 led Fowler to rent out the house, which subsequently went through a series of owners. Fowler&#x27;s Folly fell into disrepair, and finally - condemned as a public hazard - it was dynamited in 1897 by Fred C. Haight, demolition engineer for the city of Fishkill.

==Surviving examples==
Estimates vary but hundreds of these Victorian-era homes are still standing across the United States and Canada. One estimate puts the number at 2,077. Even in their heyday, octagon houses were never mainstream. 

The largest remaining octagon homes in the United States are Longwood in Natchez, Mississippi and the Octagon House in Watertown, Wisconsin. Both homes are open to the public. In Eastern Washington state one still sits where it was moved to in 1993 to Bridgeport, near the Columbia River.

Fowler was influential, but not the only proponent of octagonal houses and other structures. There are also octagonal barns, schoolhouses, churches, and in Canada, octagonal &quot;dead houses&quot;.

==Design and variations==
Within the central idea of the octagonal plan, these houses show a wide variety of both construction and outward form. They range from the modest two-storey Bevis-Tucker House, to the grandiose Armour-Stiner House (both are illustrated below).

A full octagon house has eight equal sides, although slight variations in length are not unusual. In some cases the basic octagon is partially obscured by additions, either all round as at the Zelotes Holmes House, or by adding a functional wing out of sight at the rear. The House of the Seven Gables in Mayo, Florida has gables on seven sides while the eighth side is extended to the rear. 
The Richard Peacon House in Key West, Florida, appears to be a full octagon from the street but the rear portion is squared off.

Fowler advocated the use of &quot;gravel wall&quot; construction for the walls. This was an experimental technique at the time, and although some were built that way, most octagon houses were built the same way as ordinary houses, of timber frame, brick or stone.

===Planned community ===
A moral community headed by Henry S. Clubb tried to establish Octagon City in 1856 in Kansas.
It was intended to have an octagonal square with eight roads and octagonal farmhouses and barns.
Most settlers had left after the winter.

==Examples of octagon houses==
The following are examples of the &#x27;true&#x27; octagon houses and the range of design variations to be found.
==Case study: Watertown Octagon House, Wisconsin==


Although one of the largest, the Watertown house is midway between the grandest and most modest surviving examples. It is well documented, has been carefully restored, and is open to the public as a museum.

===History===
Construction was completed 1854. The house fell into disuse and was taken over by the newly founded Watertown Historical Society, and opened to the public in 1938. It is still owned by the Society.

===Construction and innovations===
* The plan is a octagon, with a veranda all round at first- and second-floor levels.
* The house is built on stone foundations, with external walls of brickwork thick.
* The central square is made up of two leaves of brickwork with a cavity, which is used for chimney flues and warm air ducting, to heat rooms without fireplaces. The double wall eliminates the need for projecting chimney breasts.
* The battlement effect at the top of the cupola is actually the four chimneys.
* A furnace in the basement heats water, and warm air is ducted into the twelve main rooms, i.e. those adjoining the central square.
* An elegant spiral staircase links all the floors. It is self-supporting on the inside and built into the walls on the outside of the stairwell. There is also a servants&#x27; staircase.
* The house has a flat roof, sloping gently towards the center.
* Rainwater from the roof was collected in a reservoir at third-floor level, and overflows into a cistern next to the kitchen in the basement.
* Publications regularly state the house has 57 rooms; however this includes every closet and passage. The number of habitable rooms is 29, including the octagonal room in the cupola.
* Despite having 15 bedrooms there is just a single bathroom.

===Architectural style===
The house was inspired by Fowler&#x27;s book, and is a good example of his theories put into practice. Features which are directly linked to his ideas, apart from the octagonal plan, are the central spiral staircase, symmetrical arrangement of rooms with interconnecting doors, the verandas running all round the building, and the flat roof surmounted by a cupola. In accordance with Fowler&#x27;s theories, the detailing is relatively plain for the period. Openings are simply framed by moldings. The covered verandas lack excess detail, having modest turned balustrade spindles and supporting posts. The decorative effect of the house comes from the basic design features: the octagonal shape and the external verandas.

There are four generously sized rooms on each floor, nearly 18 foot square, with connecting doors all round. The subsidiary rooms are less satisfactory, being triangular. The arrangement of rooms is rigidly the same on all floors because the partition walls are of brickwork, so they must stack one above the other. The central spiral stair is compact, but leaves one side of the house without direct access to the landings, so there are bedrooms only accessible through another bedroom - in the worst case, through two other bedrooms. Fowler&#x27;s own house had external staircases and the verandas were used for circulation and access to the rooms.

===Record drawings===
Below are drawings of the Watertown Octagon House dated March 28, 1935, prepared by the Historic American Buildings Survey. At that time the verandas were missing, removed when they became dangerously rotten. The survey drawings are a reconstruction of the house as it was originally built.

<doc id="515898" wikidata="Q203516" url="?curid=515898" title="Birth rate">
<text>Birth rate, also known as natality, is the total number of live human births per 1,000 population for a given period divided by the length of the period in years. The number of live births is normally taken from a universal registration system for births; population counts from a census, and estimation through specialized demographic techniques such as population pyramids. The birth rate (along with mortality and migration rates) is used to calculate population growth. The estimated average population may be taken as the mid-year population.

When the crude death rate is subtracted from the crude birth rate (CBR), the result is the rate of natural increase (RNI). This is equal to the rate of population change (excluding migration).

The total (crude) birth rate (which includes all births)—typically indicated as births per 1,000 population—is distinguished from a set of age-specific rates (the number of births per 1,000 persons, or more usually 1,000 females, in each age group). The first known use of the term &quot;birth rate&quot; in English was in 1856.

The average global birth rate was 17 births per 1,000 total population in 2024. The death rate was 7.9 per 1,000. The RNI was thus 0.91 percent.
In 2012, the average global birth rate was 19.611 per 1,000 according to the World Bank and 19.15 births per 1,000 total population according to the CIA, compared to 20.09 per 1,000 total population in 2007.

The 2024 average of 17 births per 1,000 total population equates to approximately 4.3 births per second or about 260 births per minute for the world. On average, two people in the world die every second or about 121 per minute.

== In politics ==
The birth rate is an issue of concern and policy for national governments. Some (including those of Italy and Malaysia) seek to increase the birth rate with financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies to reduce the birth rate (for example, China&#x27;s one-child policy which was in effect from 1978 to 2015). Policies to increase the crude birth rate are known as pro-natalist policies, and policies to reduce the crude birth rate are known as anti-natalist policies. Non-coercive measures such as improved information on birth control and its availability have achieved good results in countries such as Iran and Bangladesh.

There has also been discussion on whether bringing women into the forefront of development initiatives will lead to a decline in birth rates. In some countries, government policies have focused on reducing birth rates by improving women&#x27;s rights, sexual and reproductive health. Typically, high birth rates are associated with health problems, low life expectancy, low living standards, low social status for women and low educational levels. Demographic transition theory postulates that as a country undergoes economic development and social change its population growth declines, with birth rates serving as an indicator.

At the 1974 World Population Conference in Bucharest, Romania, women&#x27;s issues gained considerable attention. Family programs were discussed, and 137 countries drafted a World Population Plan of Action. As part of the discussion, many countries accepted modern birth control methods such as the birth control pill and the condom while opposing abortion. Population concerns, as well as the desire to include women in the discourse, were discussed; it was agreed that improvements in women&#x27;s status and initiatives in defense of reproductive health and freedom, the environment, and sustainable socioeconomic development were needed.

Birth rates ranging from 10 to 20 births per 1,000 are considered low, while rates from 40 to 50 births per 1,000 are considered high. There are problems associated with high birth rates, and there may be problems associated with low birth rates. High birth rates may contribute to malnutrition and starvation, stress government welfare and family programs, and more importantly store up overpopulation for the future, and increase human damage to other species and habitats, and environmental degradation. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental impact of a large population. Low birth rates may stress the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and stress families who must support the elders themselves. There will be fewer younger able-bodied people who may be needed to support an ageing population, if a high proportion of older people become disabled and unable to care for themselves.

== Population control ==

In the 20th century, several authoritarian governments sought either to increase or to decrease the birth rates, sometimes through forceful intervention. One of the most notorious natalist policies was that in communist Romania in 1967–1990, during the time of communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu, who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. This policy has been depicted in movies and documentaries (such as &quot;4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days&quot;, and &quot;Children of the Decree&quot;). These policies temporarily increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a decline due to the increased use of illegal abortion. Ceaușescu&#x27;s policy resulted in over 9,000 deaths of women due to illegal abortions, large numbers of children put into Romanian orphanages by parents who could not cope with raising them, street children in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended on the streets), and overcrowding in homes and schools. Ultimately, this aggressive natalist policy led to a generation who eventually led the Romanian Revolution which overthrew and executed him.

In stark contrast to Ceaușescu&#x27;s natalist policy was China&#x27;s one child policy, in effect from 1978 to 2015, which included abuses such as forced abortions. This policy has also been deemed responsible for the common practice of sex-selective abortion which led to an imbalanced sex ratio in the country. Given strict family size limitations and a preference for sons, girls became unwanted in China because they were considered as depriving the parents of the chance of having a son. With the progress of prenatal sex-determination technologies and induced abortion, the one-child policy gradually turned into a one-son policy.

In many countries, the steady decline in birth rates over the past decades can largely be attributed to the significant gains in women&#x27;s freedoms, such as tackling forced marriage and child marriage, access to contraception, equal access to education, and increased socioeconomic opportunities. Women of all economic, social, religious and educational persuasions are choosing to have fewer children as they are gaining more control over their own reproductive rights. Apart from more children living into their adult years, women are often more ambitious to take up education and paid work outside the home, and to live their own lives rather than just a life of reproduction and unpaid domestic work. Birth rates have fallen due to the introduction of family planning clinics and other access to contraception.

In Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, women are less likely to have two children (or more) than they were before 1999, according to Australian demographer Jack Caldwell. Bangladeshi women eagerly took up contraceptives, such as condoms and the pill, according to a study in 1994 by the World Bank. The study proved that family planning could be carried out and accepted practically anywhere. Caldwell also believes that agricultural improvements led to the need for less labour. Children not needed to plough the fields would be of surplus and require some education, so in turn, families become smaller and women are able to work and have greater ambitions. Other examples of non-coercive family planning policies are Ethiopia, Thailand and Indonesia.

Myanmar was controlled until 2011 by an austere military junta, intent on controlling every aspect of people&#x27;s lives. The generals wanted the country&#x27;s population doubled. In their view, women&#x27;s job was to produce babies to power the country&#x27;s labour force, so family planning was vehemently opposed. The women of Burma opposed this policy, and Peter McDonald of the Australian National University argues that this gave rise to a black market trade in contraceptives, smuggled in from neighbouring Thailand.

In 1990, five years after the Iraq-Iran war ended, Iran saw the fastest recorded fall in fertility in world history. Revolution gave way to consumerism and westernization. With TVs and cars came condoms and birth control pills. A generation of women had been expected to produce soldiers to fight Iraq, but the next generation of women could choose to enjoy some newfound luxuries. During the war, the women of Iran averaged about 8 children each, a ratio the hard-line Islamic President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wanted to revive. As of 2010, the birth rate of Iran is 1.7 babies per woman. Some observers claim this to be a triumph of Western values of freedom for women against states with Islamic values.

Islamic clerics are also having less influence over women in other Muslim countries. In the past 30 years Turkey&#x27;s fertility rate of children per woman has dropped from 4.07 to 2.08. Tunisia has dropped from 4.82 to 2.14 and Morocco from 5.4 to 2.52 children per woman.

Latin America, of predominately Catholic faith, has seen the same trends of falling fertility rates. Brazilian women are having half the children compared to 25 years ago: a rate of 1.7 children per woman. The Vatican now has less influence over women in other hard-line Catholic countries. Mexico, El Salvador, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru have all seen significant drops in fertility in the same period, all going from over six to less than three children per woman. Forty percent of married Brazilian women are choosing to get sterilised after having children, but this may be because it only requires confession on one occasion. Some observers claim this to be a triumph of modern Western values of freedom for women against states with Catholic values.

== National birth rates ==
According to the CIA&#x27;s &quot;The World Factbook&quot;, who presumably get their figures from the World Health Organization, the country with the highest birth rate is Niger at 6.49 children born per woman and the country with the lowest birth rate is Taiwan, at 1.13 children born per woman. However, despite not having any official records, it can be presumed for obvious reasons (only men are allowed to be Catholic priests) that the Holy See has the lowest birth rate of any sovereign state.
Compared with the 1950s (when the birth rate was 36 per thousand), as of 2011, the world birth rate has declined by 16 per thousand.

As of 2017, Niger has had 49.443 births per thousand people. 
Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world with 8 per thousand people.
While in Japan there are 126 million people and in Niger 21 million, both countries had around 1 million babies born in 2016.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
The region of Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest birth rate in the world. As of 2016, Niger, Mali, Uganda, Zambia, and Burundi have the highest birth rates in the world. This is part of the fertility-income paradox, as these countries are very poor, and it may seem counter-intuitive for families there to have so many children. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a &quot;demographic-economic &quot;paradox&quot;&quot; by the notion that greater means would enable the production of more offspring as suggested by the influential Thomas Malthus.

===Afghanistan===
Afghanistan has the 11th highest birth rate in the world, and also the highest birth rate of any non-African country (as of 2016). The rapid population growth of Afghanistan is considered a problem when it prevents population stabilization and affects maternal and infant health. Reasons for large families include tradition, religion, the different roles of men and women, and the cultural desire to have several sons.

=== Australia ===
Historically, Australia has had a relatively low fertility rate, reaching a high of 3.14 births per woman in 1960. This was followed by a decline which continued until the mid-2000, when a one off cash incentive was introduced to reverse the decline. In 2004, the then Howard government introduced a non-means tested &#x27;Maternity Payment&#x27; to parents of every newborn as a substitute to maternity leave. The payment known as the &#x27;Baby Bonus&#x27; was A$3000 per child. This rose to A$5000 which was paid in 13 installments.

At a time when Australia&#x27;s unemployment was at a 28-year low of 5.2%, the then Treasurer Peter Costello stated there was opportunity to go lower. With a good economic outlook for Australia, Costello held the view that now was a good time to expand the population, with his famous quote that every family should have three children &quot;one for mum, one for dad and one for the country&quot;. Australia&#x27;s fertility rate reached a peak of 1.95 children per woman in 2010, a 30-year high, although still below replacement rate.

Phil Ruthven of the business information firm IBISWorld believes the spike in fertility was more about timing and less about monetary incentives. Generation X was now aged 25 to 45 years old. With numerous women putting pregnancies off for a few years for the sake of a career, many felt the years closing in and their biological clocks ticking.

On 1 March 2014, the baby bonus was replaced with Family Tax Benefit A. By then the baby bonus had left its legacy on Australia.

In 2016, Australia&#x27;s fertility rate has only decreased slightly to 1.91 children per woman.

=== France ===
France has been successful in increasing fertility rates from the low levels seen in the late 1980s, after a continuous fall in the birth rate. In 1994, the total fertility rate was as low as 1.66, but perhaps due to the active family policy of the government in the mid-1990s, it has increased, and maintained an average of 2.0 from 2008 until 2015.

France has embarked on a strong incentive policy based on two key measures to restore the birth rate: family benefits (&quot;les allocations familiales&quot;) and a family-coefficient of income tax (&quot;le quotient familial&quot;). Since the end of World War II, early family policy in France has been based on a family tradition that requires children to support multi-child family, so that a third child enables a multi-child family to benefit from family allowances and income tax exemptions. This is intended to allow families with three children to enjoy the same living standards as households without children.

In particular, the French income taxation system is structured so that families with children receive tax breaks greater than single adults without children. This income tax imposition system is known as the family coefficient of income tax. A characteristic of the family factor is that households with a large number of children, even if they are at the same standard of living, can receive more tax exemption benefits.

Since the 1970s, the focus has been on supporting families who are vulnerable such as single parent families and the children of a poor family in order to ensure equality of opportunity. In addition, as many women began to participate in the labor market, the government introduced policies of financial support for childcare leave as well as childcare facilities. In 1994, the government expanded the parent education allowance (&quot;l&#x27;allocation parentale d&#x27;éducation&quot;) for women with two children to ensure freedom of choice and reduce formal unemployment in order to promote family well-being and women&#x27;s labor participation.

There are also:
* an infant child care allowance, family allowance and family allowance for multichild family, and a multi-element family pension scheme.
*a medical insurance system that covers all medical expenses, hospitalization costs, and medical expenses incurred after six months of pregnancy as 100% of the national health insurance in the national social security system, and the statutory leave system during pregnancy.

===Germany===
The birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per thousand, lower than the UK and France.

===Ireland===
In Europe as of July 2011, Ireland&#x27;s birth rate was 16.5 per 1000 (3.5 percent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK).

===Japan===
As of 2016, Japan has the third lowest crude birth rate (i.e. not allowing for the population&#x27;s age distribution) in the world, with only Saint Pierre and Miquelon and Monaco having lower crude birth rates. Japan has an unbalanced population with many elderly but few young people, and this is projected to be more extreme in the future, unless there are major changes. An increasing number of Japanese people are staying unmarried: between 1980 and 2010, the percentage of the population who had never married increased from 22% to almost 30%, even as the population continued to age, and by 2035 one in four people will not marry during their childbearing years. The Japanese sociologist Masahiro Yamada coined the term &quot;parasite singles&quot; for unmarried adults in their late 20s and 30s who continue to live with their parents.

=== South Korea ===

Since joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) in 1996, South Korea&#x27;s fertility rate has been on the decline. It recorded the lowest fertility rate among OECD countries in 2017, with just 1.1 children per woman being born. Subsequent studies indicate that Korea has broken its own record and that the fertility rate has fallen to below one child per woman. The total fertility rate in South Korea sharply declined from 4.53 in 1970 to 2.06 in 1983, falling below the replacement level of 2.10. The low birth rate accelerated in the 2000s, with the fertility rate dropping to 1.48 in 2000, 1.23 in 2010, and reaching 0.72 in 2023.

One example of Korea&#x27;s economic crisis is the housing market. Tenants may choose to buy, rent, or use the Jeonse system of renting. Landlords require the renters to upfront as much as 70% of the property value as a type of security deposit, then live rent free for the duration of the contract, usually two years. At the end of the contract, the deposit is refunded 100% back to the renter. Historically, landlords have invested the security deposit and banked on rising property values. But as inflation rises higher than the interest rates, property values plummeted. Recent government caps, aimed at protecting the renters from being victims of price gouging, restricted the profit the landlord can make on renewing the contract.

The Korean government offers a wide range of financial incentives to parents; however, many new parents, both mother and father, refuse to take full advantage of postpartum parental leave. Some fathers fear being ridiculed for taking &quot;mom leave&quot; while both working parents fear the stigma of &quot;falling behind&quot; in their professional careers. The South Korean corporate world is very unsympathetic to family needs.  

Abortion and divorce are other contributing factors for Korea&#x27;s low birth rate. In the twentieth century, due mainly to Confucian beliefs and a strong desire to sire a son, female fetuses were being aborted. This strong desire to have a son as a first child has somewhat of an oxymoron effect on today&#x27;s low birth rate, as many women will not want to marry the oldest son, aware of his financial obligation to feed, clothe and shelter the aging parents. As a result, in 1988 the government banned doctors from telling expectant parents the sex of the fetus.  Effective 1 January 2021, abortion has been decriminalized.  Divorce is another deterrent to childbirth. Although divorce has been on the rise over the last 50 years, it hit families especially hard after the economic crisis in 1997; fathers abandoning their families because they could not financially support them. In addition, the abortion of female fetuses lead to a relative shortage of women, resulting in overall lowerall birthrate in the country.

===Taiwan===
In August 2011, Taiwan&#x27;s government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that the government implemented approaches to encourage fertility.

===United Kingdom===
In July 2011, the UK&#x27;s Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4 percent increase in live births in the United Kingdom in 2010. This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years. However, the UK record year for births and birth rate remains 1920 (when the ONS reported over 957,000 births to a population of &quot;around 40 million&quot;).

===United States===

There has been a dramatic decline in birth rates in the U.S. between 2007 and 2020. The Great Recession appears to have contributed to the decline in the early period. A 2022 study did not identify any other economic, policy, or social factor that contributed to the decline. The decline may be due to shifting life priorities of recent cohorts that go through childbearing age, as there have been &quot;changes in preferences for having children, aspirations for life, and parenting norms.&quot;

A Pew research center study found evidence of a correlation between economic difficulties and fertility decline by race and ethnicity. Hispanics (particularly affected by the recession) have experienced the largest fertility decline, particularly compared to Caucasians. In 2008–2009 the birth rate declined 5.9 percent for Hispanic women, 2.4 percent for African American women and 1.6 percent for white women. The relatively large birth rate declines among Hispanics mirror their relatively large economic declines, in terms of jobs and wealth. According to the statistics using the data from National Centre for Health Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau, from 2007 to 2008, the employment rate among Hispanics declined by 1.6 percentage points, compared with declines of 0.7 points for whites. The unemployment rate shows a similar pattern—unemployment among Hispanics increased 2.0 percentage points from 2007 to 2008, while for whites the increase was 0.9 percentage points. A recent report from the Pew Hispanic Center revealed that Hispanics have also been the biggest losers in terms of wealth since the beginning of the recession, with Hispanic households losing 66% of their median wealth from 2005 to 2009. In comparison, black households lost 53% of their median wealth and white households lost only 16%.

Other factors (such as women&#x27;s labor-force participation, contraceptive technology and public policy) make it difficult to determine how much economic change affects fertility. Research suggests that much of the fertility decline during an economic downturn is a postponement of childbearing, not a decision to have fewer (or no) children; people plan to &quot;catch up&quot; to their plans of bearing children when economic conditions improve. Younger women are more likely than older women to postpone pregnancy due to economic factors, since they have more years of fertility remaining.

In July 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline. In 2013, teenage birth rates in the U.S. were at the lowest level in U.S. history. Teen birth rates in the U.S. have decreased from 1991 through 2012 (except for an increase from 2005 to 2007). The other aberration from this otherwise-steady decline in teen birth rates is the six percent decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009. Despite the decrease, U.S. teen birth rates remain higher than those in other developed nations. Racial differences affect teen birth and pregnancy rates: American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teenage birth rate.

States strict in enforcing child support have up to 20 percent fewer unmarried births than states that are lax about getting unmarried dads to pay, the researchers found. Moreover, according to the results, if all 50 states in the United States had done at least as well in their enforcement efforts as the state ranked fifth from the top, that would have led to a 20 percent reduction in out-of-wedlock births.

The United States population growth is at a historical low level, mainly because the United States birth rates in the 2010s and 2020s are the lowest ever recorded. The low birth rates in the United States post-2010 can possibly be ascribed to the recession that started in 2008, which led families to postpone having children and fewer immigrants coming to the US. The US birth rates in 2010-2014 were not high enough to maintain the size of the U.S. population, according to The Economist. Since that period, the birth rate (births per 1,000 inhabitants) has further declined from roughly 12 to roughly 10.

==Factors affecting birth rate==
There are many factors that interact in complex ways, influencing the birth rates of a population.
Developed countries have a lower birth rate than underdeveloped countries (see Income and fertility). A parent&#x27;s number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that each person in the next generation will eventually have. Factors generally associated with increased fertility include religiosity, intention to have children, and maternal support. Factors generally associated with decreased fertility include wealth, education, female labor participation, urban residence, intelligence, increased female age, women&#x27;s rights, access to family planning services and (to a lesser degree) increased male age. Many of these factors however are not universal, and differ by region and social class. For instance, at a global level, religion is correlated with increased fertility.

Reproductive health can also affect the birth rate, as untreated infections can lead to fertility problems, as can be seen in the &quot;infertility belt&quot; - a region that stretches across central Africa from the United Republic of Tanzania in the east to Gabon in the west, and which has a lower fertility than other African regions.

Child custody laws, affecting fathers&#x27; parental rights over their children from birth until child custody ends at age 18, may have an effect on the birth rate. U.S. states strict in enforcing child support have up to 20 percent fewer unmarried births than states that are lax about getting unmarried fathers to pay, the researchers found. Moreover, according to the results, if all 50 states in the United States had done at least as well in their enforcement efforts as the state ranked fifth from the top, that would have led to a 20 percent reduction in out-of-wedlock births.

== Crude birth rate ==
Crude birth rate is a measure of the number of live births occurring during the year, per 1,000 people in the population. It is normally used to predict population growth.

<text>Dr. Jennifer Melfi is a fictional character on the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. She is the psychiatrist of Mafia boss Tony Soprano. She is portrayed by Lorraine Bracco.

==Character description==
Melfi is an Italian-American, with her father&#x27;s family hailing from Caserta. She is a graduate of Bard College and Tufts University School of Medicine and has an upscale lifestyle, living in a three-bedroom condominium in Essex Fells, New Jersey and shopping frequently at gourmet Italian shops (as revealed in &quot;Meadowlands&quot;).

At the start of the series, Tony Soprano, a local mobster, was referred to Melfi, a psychiatrist, after having a panic attack. He tells her he is a waste management consultant, but Melfi knows he is a mob boss. Throughout season 1, during the power struggle between Tony and Uncle Junior over who will be the boss, Junior informs Mikey &quot;Grab Bag&quot; Palmice that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist. This makes Junior, Mikey, and all other members of Junior&#x27;s crew who were informed extremely angry and paranoid, for they fear Melfi could be potentially used as a witness to testify in court against the activities of the DiMeo crime family.

In the season 1 penultimate episode &quot;Isabella&quot;, two hit men are sent by Junior and Mikey Palmice in an attempt to assassinate Tony for supposedly giving information to Melfi. The hit fails. One assailant is inadvertently killed by the other while trying to shoot Tony in his driver&#x27;s seat from the passenger side after Tony grabs the first assassin&#x27;s gun. Tony throws the other hit man off onto the road, not killing, but injuring him. Tony laughs ecstatically but has taken his eyes off the road long enough to crash his SUV into a parked car, knocking him unconscious.

Tony later informs Melfi that his enemies are aware of their therapy sessions, and she must go into hiding to avoid getting killed until everything blows over. To save his own life and Melfi&#x27;s, Junior&#x27;s top lieutenants Mikey Palmice and Chucky Signore are killed, the latter by Tony himself. Junior is only saved by being arrested by the FBI on racketeering charges. In the season 2 premiere episode &quot;Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist&#x27;s Office...&quot;, Melfi is shown doing business and living in a small roadside motel in Wayne, New Jersey, telling her patients her office is being remodeled. After the last troublesome member of Junior&#x27;s crew, Philly &quot;Spoons&quot; Parisi, is murdered, Tony informs Melfi that &quot;it&#x27;s over&quot; and that she can go back to her normal life.

In the season 3 episode &quot;Employee of the Month&quot;, Melfi is walking alone through the parking garage to her car when she is attacked by a man. He grabs her from behind and after she attempts to escape and cries out for help, proceeds to drag her to the stairway of her building, where he violently rapes her. He leaves her lying helpless in the stairway, crying. At the hospital, she is visited by her ex-husband, Richard. Although her rapist is arrested, he is subsequently released because the chain of custody is lost by the police.

This infuriates Melfi, in shock that he was released. She comments to her psychiatrist and colleague Elliot Kupferberg, &quot;I could have that asshole squashed like a bug,&quot; meaning that she could easily have her rapist killed by telling Tony that she was raped. She also inadvertently reveals to Kupferberg that the patient she is treating is Tony Soprano. More shock comes when Melfi is in the fast-food restaurant where the rapist works. She sees his smiling picture on the wall as Employee of the Month (hence the episode title).

Melfi herself feels a crazed desire for revenge and knows that a word to Tony Soprano would obtain it, but, like her ex-husband, she will obey the social contract. Later, Dr. Melfi has a dream. She buys a soda from a vending machine; when she reaches into the machine to get it, her hand is trapped inside. A Rottweiler appears and terrifies her. Then the rapist advances toward her. The dog turns and mauls the rapist, who cries in agony. With Kupferberg, she understands the meaning: the dog is Tony Soprano taking revenge on her behalf.

She tells Tony and others she has been in a car accident. When he sees her, Tony is shocked and concerned by her injuries. He tells her he is now ready to see a behaviorist. She says, &quot;No,&quot; and starts crying. He goes to her, lays his hands gently on her, and asks what is the matter. She composes herself and asks him to return to his seat. He goes back, but asks, &quot;What? You wanna say something?&quot; After a tense pause, she says, &quot;No.&quot;

Melfi sees Dr. Kupferberg on a regular basis. In &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, he tells her that a recent study has shown that talk therapy may only help a sociopath become more sociopathic. Elliot has commented that treating Tony Soprano gives her a &quot;vicarious thrill&quot;. Melfi tells Elliott she used to find Tony attractive at first, but no longer. She does not mention that shortly before this session, she had an erotic dream about herself and Tony.

Melfi attends a dinner party with Elliot and other colleagues, but the conversation turns to the recent study claiming sociopaths take advantage of talk therapy. Kupferberg angers and shocks her by revealing to all present that Tony Soprano is her patient. However, she reads the study at home and is convinced of its findings. At his next session Tony is relaxed, while her responses become sarcastic and aggressive. When she says she intends to cease treating him, he is taken aback and hurt: &quot;We&#x27;re making progress! It&#x27;s been seven years!&quot; She says, &quot;You don&#x27;t give a shit about commitments, about what I do.&quot; She waits for him to go, then closes the door on him.

==Character origins==
David Chase modeled the character of Jennifer Melfi after his own psychiatrist. Bracco played the wife of a mobster in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990) and she was originally asked to play the role of Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt that the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her.

<doc id="515917" wikidata="Q4862505" url="?curid=515917" title="Baron Hunsdon">
<text>Baron [[Hunsdon]] is a title that has been created three times.

It was first created in 1559 in the Peerage of England for the soldier and courtier Henry Carey. His grandson, the fourth Baron, was created by Viscount Rochford in 1621 and [[Earl of Dover]], in the County of Kent, in 1628. These titles were also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He had already in 1640 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s barony of Hunsdon. However, on his death in 1677, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. The barony passed to his second cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Sir Edmund Carey, the younger son of the first Baron. On his death, the title passed to his first cousin, the seventh Baron. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the eighth Baron. On the latter&#x27;s death in 1765, the barony became extinct as well.

The second creation was in 1832 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lucius Cary, 10th Viscount Falkland, a peer of Scotland, was created Baron Hunsdon, of Scutterskelfe in the county of York. This title became extinct on his death in 1884.

The title was created again in 1923 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony was revived for the businessman Herbert Gibbs, who was made Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon, of Briggens in the County of Hertford. Gibbs was the fourth son of Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham (see the Baron Aldenham for earlier history of the family). He was a partner in the family firm of Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons, and also served as Chairman of the Public Works Loan Board. In 1908, Gibbs acquired Hunsdon House and the Briggens estate in Hertfordshire. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. In 1939, he succeeded his cousin to the barony of Aldenham. The two baronies remain united.
