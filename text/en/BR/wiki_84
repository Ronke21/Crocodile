<text>The Mandinka or Malinke are a West African ethnic group primarily found in southern Mali, The Gambia, southern Senegal and eastern Guinea. Numbering about 11 million, they are the largest subgroup of the Mandé peoples and one of the largest ethnolinguistic groups in Africa. They speak the Manding languages in the Mande language family, which are a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in much of West Africa. Virtually all of Mandinka people are adherent to Islam, mostly based on the Maliki jurisprudence. They are predominantly subsistence farmers and live in rural villages. Their largest urban center is Bamako, the capital of Mali.

The Mandinka are the descendants of the Mali Empire, which rose to power in the 13th century under the rule of king Sundiata Keita, who founded an empire that would go on to span a large part of West Africa. They migrated west from the Niger River in search of better agricultural lands and more opportunities for conquest. Nowadays, the Mandinka inhabit the West Sudanian savanna region extending from The Gambia and the Casamance region in Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Guinea Bissau. Although widespread, the Mandinka constitute the largest ethnic group only in the countries of Mali, Guinea and The Gambia. Most Mandinka live in family-related compounds in traditional rural villages. Their traditional society has featured socially stratified castes. Mandinka communities have been fairly autonomous and self-ruled, being led by a chief and group of elders. Mandinka has been an oral society, where mythologies, history and knowledge are verbally transmitted from one generation to the next. Their music and literary traditions are preserved by a caste of griots, known locally as &quot;jalolu&quot; (singular, &quot;jali&quot;), as well as guilds and brotherhoods like the &quot;donso&quot; (hunters).

Between the 16th and 19th centuries, many Muslim and non-Muslim Mandinka people, along with numerous other African ethnic groups, were captured, enslaved and shipped to the Americas. They intermixed with slaves and workers of other ethnicities, creating a Creole culture. The Mandinka people significantly influenced the African heritage of descended peoples now found in Brazil, the Southern United States and, to a lesser extent, the Caribbean.

==History==
===Origins===
The history of Mandinka, as with many Mandé peoples, begins with the Ghana Empire, also known as Wagadu. Mande hunters founded communities in Manden, which would become the political and cultural center of the Mandinka, but also in Bambuk and the Senegal river valley. The Mande diaspora from Ghana extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Gao.

The mythical ancestors of the Malinké and the Bambara people are Kontron and Sanin, the founding &quot;hunter brotherhood&quot;. Manden was famous for the large number of animals and game that it sheltered, as well as its dense vegetation, so was a very popular hunting ground. The Camara (or Kamara) are believed to be the oldest family to have lived in Manden, after having left Wagadou, due to drought. They founded the first village of Manding, Kiri, then Kirina, Siby, Kita. A very large number of families that make up the Mandinka community were born in Manden. Manding is the province from which the Mali Empire started, under the leadership of Sundiata Keita. The Manden were initially a part of many fragmented kingdoms that formed after the collapse of Ghana empire in the 11th century.

===Mali Empire===

During the rule of Sundiata Keita, these kingdoms were consolidated, and the Mandinka expanded west from the Niger River basin under Sundiata&#x27;s general Tiramakhan Traore. This expansion was a part of creating a region of conquest, according to the oral tradition of the Mandinka people. This migration began in the later part of the 13th century.
Another group of Mandinka people, under Faran Kamara – the son of the king of Tabou – expanded southeast of Mali, while a third group expanded with Fakoli Kourouma.

With the migration, many gold artisans and metal working Mandinka smiths settled along the coast and in the hilly Fouta Djallon and plateau areas of West Africa. Their presence and products attracted Mandika merchants and brought trading caravans from north Africa and the eastern Sahel, states Toby Green – a professor of African History and Culture. It also brought conflicts with other ethnic groups, such as the Wolof people, particularly the Jolof Empire.

The caravan trade to North Africa and Middle East brought Islamic people into Mandinka people&#x27;s original and expanded home region. The Muslim traders sought presence in the host Mandinka community, and this likely initiated proselytizing efforts to convert the Mandinka from their traditional religious beliefs into Islam. In Ghana, for example, the Almoravids had divided its capital into two parts by 1077, one part was Muslim and the other non-Muslim. The Muslim influence from North Africa had arrived in the Mandinka region before this, via Islamic trading diasporas.
In 1324, Mansa Musa who ruled Mali, went on Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca with a caravan carrying gold. Shihab al-Umari, the Arabic historian, described his visit and stated that Musa built mosques in his kingdom, established Islamic prayers and took back Maliki school of Sunni jurists with him. According to Richard Turner – a professor of African American Religious History, Musa was highly influential in attracting North African and Middle Eastern Muslims to West Africa.

The Mandinka people of Mali converted early, but those who migrated to the west did not convert and retained their traditional religious rites. One of the legends among the Mandingo of western Africa is that the general Tiramakhan Traore led the migration, because people in Mali had converted to Islam and he did not want to. Another legend gives a contrasting account, and states that Traore himself had converted and married Muhammad&#x27;s granddaughter. The Traore&#x27;s marriage with a Muhammad&#x27;s granddaughter, states Toby Green, is fanciful, but these conflicting oral histories suggest that Islam had arrived well before the 13th century and had a complex interaction with the Mandinka people.

Through a series of conflicts, primarily with the Fula-led jihads under Imamate of Futa Jallon, many Mandinka converted to Islam. In contemporary West Africa, the Mandinka are predominantly Muslim, with a few regions where significant portions of the population are not Muslim, such as Guinea Bissau, where 35 percent of the Mandinka practice Islam, more than 20 percent are Christian, and 15 percent follow traditional beliefs.

===Slavery===
Slave raiding, capture and trading in the Mandinka regions may have existed in significant numbers before the European colonial era, as is evidenced in the memoirs of the 14th century Moroccan traveller and Islamic historian Ibn Battuta. Slaves were part of the socially stratified Mandinka people, and several Mandinka language words, such as &quot;Jong&quot; or &quot;Jongo&quot; refer to slaves. There were fourteen Mandinke kingdoms along the Gambia River in the Senegambia region during the early 19th century, for example, where slaves were a part of the social strata in all these kingdoms.
According to Toby Green, selling slaves along with gold was already a significant part of the trans-Saharan caravan trade across the Sahel between West Africa and the Middle East after the 13th century. With the arrival of Portuguese explorers in Africa as they looked for a sea route to India, the European purchase of slaves had begun. The shipment of slaves by the Portuguese, primarily from the Jolof people, along with some Mandinka, started in the 15th century, states Green, but the earliest evidence of a trade involving Mandinka slaves is from and after 1497 CE. In parallel with the start of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the institution of slavery and slave-trading of West Africans into the Mediterranean region and inside Africa continued as a historic normal practice.

Slavery grew significantly between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Portuguese considered slave sources in Guinea and Senegambia parts of Mandinka territory as belonging to them; their 16th to 18th-century slave trade-related documents refer to &quot;our Guinea&quot; and complain about slave traders from other European nations superseding them in the slave trade. Their slave exports from this region nearly doubled in the second half of the 18th century compared to the first, and most of these slaves disembarked in Brazil.

Scholars have offered several theories on the source of the transatlantic slave trade of Mandinka people. According to Boubacar Barry, a professor of History and African Studies, chronic violence between ethnic groups such as the Mandinka people and their neighbours, combined with weapons sold by slave traders and lucrative income from slave ships to the slave sellers, fed the practice of groups raiding for captives, conducting manhunts, and taking slaves. The victimised ethnic group felt justified in retaliating. Slavery was already an accepted practice before the 15th century, when most enslaved people were taken on routes to North Africa and western Asia by Arab traders.

As the demand grew, states Barry, Futa Jallon, led by an Islamic military theocracy, became one of the centers of this slavery-perpetuating violence. Farim of Kaabu (the commander of Mandinka people in Kaabu) energetically hunted for slaves on a large scale. Martin Klein (a professor of African Studies) states that Kaabu was one of the early suppliers of African slaves to European merchants.

The historian Walter Rodney states that Mandinka and other ethnic groups already held slaves who had inherited slavery by birth, and who could be sold. The Islamic armies from Sudan had long established the practice of slave raids and trade. Fula jihad from Futa Jallon plateau perpetuated and expanded this practice.

These jihads captured the highest number of slaves to sell to Portuguese traders at the ports controlled by Mandinka people. The insecure ethnic groups, states Rodney, stopped working productively and tried to withdraw for security, which made their social and economic conditions more desperate. Though less powerful, such groups also joined the retaliatory cycle of slave raids and violence.

Walter Hawthorne (a professor of African History) states that the Barry and Rodney explanation was not universally true for all of Senegambia and Guinea, where high concentrations of Mandinka people have traditionally lived. Hawthorne says that numerous Mandinka were not exported to the various European colonies in North America, South America and the Caribbean until the period between the mid-18th through to the 19th century. During these years, slave trade records show that nearly 33% of the slaves from Senegambia and Guinea-Bissau coasts were Mandinka people. Hawthorne suggests three causes of Mandinka people being taken captive as slaves during this era: small-scale jihads by Muslims against non-Muslim Mandinka, non-religious reasons such as the economic greed of Islamic elites who wanted imports of goods and tools from the coast, and attacks by the Fula people on the Mandinka&#x27;s Kaabu, with consequent cycle of violence.

===Wassoulou Empire===

==Economy==

In the 21st century, the Mandinka continue as rural subsistence farmers who rely on peanuts, rice, millet, maize, and small-scale husbandry for their livelihood. During the wet season, men plant peanuts as their main cash crop. Men also grow millet. The women grow rice (traditionally, African rice), tending the plants by hand.
This is extremely labour-intensive and physically demanding work. Only about 50% of the rice consumption needs are met by local planting; the rest is imported from Asia and the United States.

The oldest male is the head of the family, and marriages are commonly arranged. Small mud houses with conical thatch or tin roofs make up their villages, which are organised on the basis of clan groups. While farming is the predominant profession among the Mandinka, men also work as tailors, butchers, taxi drivers, woodworkers, metalworkers, soldiers, nurses, and extension workers for aid agencies. 

==Religion==
Today, most Mandinka people practice Islam. 

Some Mandinka syncretise Islam and traditional African religions. Among these syncretists, it is believed that spirits can be controlled mainly through the power of a marabout, who knows the protective formulas. In most cases, the people do not make important decisions without first consulting a marabout. Marabouts, who have Islamic training, write Qur&#x27;anic verses on slips of paper and sew them into leather pouches (talisman); these are worn as protective amulets.

The conversion of the Mandinka to Islam took place over many centuries. According to Robert Wyndham Nicholls, Mandinka in Senegambia started converting to Islam as early as the 17th century, and most of Mandinka leatherworkers there converted to Islam before the 19th century. Mandinka musicians, however, were last, converting to Islam mostly in the first half of the 20th century. As in other locales, these Muslims have continued some of their pre-Islamic religious practices as well, such as their annual rain ceremony and &quot;sacrifice of the black bull&quot; to their past deities.

==Society and culture==

Most Mandinka live in family-related compounds in traditional rural villages. Mandinka villages are fairly autonomous and self-ruled, being led by a council of upper-class elders and a chief who functions as a first among equals.

===Family and political organisation===
In Mandinka society the &quot;lu&quot; (extended family) is the basic unit, and is led by a &quot;fa&quot; (family head) who manages relations with other &quot;fa&quot;. A &quot;dugu&quot; (village) is formed by a collection of &quot;lu&quot;, and the &quot;dugu&quot; is led by the &quot;fa&quot; of the most important &quot;lu&quot;, aided by the &quot;dugu-tigi&quot; (village head or &quot;fa&quot; of the first &quot;lu&quot; that settled there). A group of &quot;dugu-tigi&quot; form a &quot;kafu&quot; (confederation) headed by a &quot;kafu-tigi&quot;. The Keita clan initially held the status of &quot;kafu-tigi&quot; before Sundiata&#x27;s expansion and the creation of the &quot;mansa&quot; (king/emperor).

===Social stratification===
The Mandinka people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, as are many West African ethnic groups with castes. The Mandinka society, states Arnold Hughes, a professor of West African Studies and African Politics, has been &quot;divided into three endogamous castes – the freeborn (&quot;foro&quot;), slaves (&quot;jongo&quot;), and artisans and praise singers (&quot;nyamolo&quot;). The freeborn castes are primarily farmers. The enslaved strata included labor providers to the farmers, as well as leather workers, pottery makers, metal smiths, griots, and others.

The Mandinka Muslim clerics and scribes have traditionally been considered a separate occupational caste called &quot;Jakhanke&quot;, with their Islamic roots traceable to about the 13th century.

The Mandinka castes are hereditary, and marriages outside the caste was forbidden. Their caste system is similar to those of other ethnic groups of the African Sahel region. These castes are also common across Mandinka communities such as those in The Gambia, Mali, Guinea, and other countries.

===Rites of passage===
The Mandinka practice a rite of passage, kuyangwoo, which marks the beginning of adulthood for their children. At an age between four and fourteen, the youngsters have their genitalia ritually mutilated (see articles on male and female genital mutilation), in separate groups according to their sex. In years past, the children spent up to a year in the bush, but that has been reduced now to coincide with their physical healing time, between three and four weeks.

During this time, they learn about their adult social responsibilities and rules of behaviour. Preparation is made in the village or compound for the return of the children. A celebration marks the return of these new adults to their families. As a result of these traditional teachings, in marriage a woman&#x27;s loyalty remains to her parents and her family; a man&#x27;s to his.

====Female genital mutilation====
The women among the Mandinka people, like other ethnic groups near them, have traditionally practiced female genital mutilation (FGM), traditionally referred to as &quot;female circumcision.&quot; According to UNICEF, the female genital mutilation prevalence rates among the Mandinka of The Gambia is the highest at over 96%, followed by FGM among the women of the Jola people at 91%, and Fula people at 88%.

Among the Mandinka women of some other countries of West Africa, the FGM prevalence rates are lower, but still range between 40% and 90%. This cultural practice, locally called &quot;Niaka&quot; or &quot;Kuyungo&quot; or &quot;Musolula Karoola&quot; or &quot;Bondo&quot;, involves the partial or total removal of the clitoris, or alternatively, the partial or total removal of the labia minora with the clitoris.

Some surveys, such as those by the Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices (GAMCOTRAP), estimate FGM is prevalent among 100% of the Mandinka in Gambia. In 2010, after community efforts of UNICEF and the local government bodies, several Mandinka women&#x27;s organization pledged to abandon the female genital mutilation practices.

===Marriage===
Marriages are traditionally arranged by family members rather than by either the bride or groom. This practice is particularly prevalent in the rural areas. The suitor&#x27;s family formally sends Kola nuts, a bitter nut from a tree, to the male elders of the bride-to-be. If they accept the nuts, the courtship may begin.

Polygamy has been practiced among the Mandinka since pre-Islamic days. A Mandinka man is legally allowed to have up to four wives, as long as he is able to care for each of them equally. Mandinka believe the crowning glory of any woman is the ability to produce children, especially sons. The first wife has authority over any subsequent wives. The husband has complete control over his wives and is responsible for feeding and clothing them. He also helps the wives&#x27; parents when necessary. Wives are expected to live together in harmony, at least superficially. They share work responsibilities of the compound, such as cooking, laundry, and other tasks.

===Music===
Mandinka culture is rich in tradition, music, and spiritual ritual. The Mandinka continue a long oral history tradition through stories, songs, and proverbs. In rural areas, the influence of western education is minimal; the literacy rate in Latin script among these Mandinka is quite low. But, more than half the adult population can read the local Arabic script (including Mandinka Ajami). Small Qur&#x27;anic schools for children where this is taught are quite common. Mandinka children are given their name on the eighth day after their birth. The children are almost always named after a very important person in their family.

The Mandinka have a rich oral history that is passed down through sung versions by griots. This passing down of oral history through music has made the practice of music one of the most distinctive traits of the Mandinka. They have long been known for their drumming and also for their unique musical instrument, the kora. The kora is a twenty-one-stringed West African harp made from a halved, dried, hollowed-out gourd covered with cow or goat skin. The strings are made of fishing line (these were traditionally made from a cow&#x27;s tendons). It is played to accompany a griot&#x27;s singing or simply on its own.

A Mandinka religious and cultural site under consideration for World Heritage status is located in Guinea at Gberedou/Hamana.
====The kora====
The kora has become the hallmark of traditional Mandinka musicians&quot;. The kora with its 21 strings is made from half a calabash, covered with cow&#x27;s hide fastened on by decorative tacks. The kora has sound holes in the side which are used to store coins offered to the praise singers, in appreciation of their performance. The praise singers are called &quot;jalibaa&quot; or &quot;jalolu&quot; in Mandinka.

==In literature and other media==
*Malian author Massa Makan Diabaté wrote novels that refer to Mandinka legends, including &quot;Janjon&quot;, which won the 1971 Grand prix littéraire d&#x27;Afrique noire. His novels &quot;The Lieutenant of Kouta&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Kouta&quot; and &quot;The Butcher of Kouta&quot; attempt to capture the proverbs and customs of the Mandinka people.
*In 1976 American writer Alex Haley published his novel &quot;&quot;, tracing his family connections through free and enslaved generations to an 18th-century ancestor taken captive and brought to North America, a Mandinka man known as Kunta Kinte. In the course of his research, he traveled to West Africa and heard about his people from a griot. The book was on the New York Times bestseller for many weeks and was also adapted as a popular TV mini-series. Many professional historians and at least one genealogist commented that this familial link was highly improbable (see D. Wright&#x27;s &quot;The World And A Very Small Place&quot;).
*Martin R. Delany, a 19th-century abolitionist, military leader, politician and physician in the United States, was of partial Mandinka descent.
*Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 1988 hit &quot;Mandinka&quot; was inspired by Alex Haley&#x27;s book.
*Mr. T, of American television fame, once claimed that his distinctive hairstyle was modelled after a Mandinka warrior that he saw in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. In his motivational video &quot;Be Somebody... or Be Somebody&#x27;s Fool!&quot;, Mr. T states: &quot;My folks came from Africa. They were from the Mandinka tribe. They wore their hair like this. These gold chains I wear symbolize the fact that my ancestors were brought over here as slaves.&quot; In a 2006 interview, he reiterated that he modeled his hair style after photographs of Mandinka men he saw in &quot;National Geographic&quot;.

<text>HMAS &quot;Pioneer (formerlyHMS &quot;Pioneer) was a protected cruiser built for the Royal Navy at the end of the 19th century. She was transferred to the fledgling Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in 1912. During World War I, the cruiser captured two German merchant ships, and was involved in the East African Campaign, including the blockade of the cruiser and a bombardment of Dar-es-Salaam. She returned to Australia in late 1916 and was decommissioned. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was used as an accommodation ship for the following six years, then was stripped down and sold off by 1926. The cruiser was scuttled outside Sydney Heads in 1931.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Pioneer&quot; was a third-class protected cruiser of the nine-ship &quot;Pelorus&quot; or P class. These ships had a displacement of 2,200 tons, were long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion was supplied by inverted three-cylinder triple expansion steam engines, providing to two propeller shafts. Although designed to reach speeds of , &quot;Pioneer&quot; was only capable of .

The cruiser was armed with eight single QF guns, eight single QF 3-pounder guns, two field guns, three Maxim machine guns, and two torpedo tubes sited above the waterline. The ship&#x27;s company initially stood at 225, but this was later reduced to 188; 12 officers, and 176 sailors.

&quot;Pioneer&quot; was laid down for the Royal Navy at HM Dockyard, Chatham, Kent on 16 December 1897. She was launched 28 June 1899 by Miss Andoe, daughter of the dockyard&#x27;s admiral superintendent. &quot;Pioneer&quot; underwent steaming trials on 2 September making 17.6 knots during six runs over the measured mile off Maplin Sands. The cruiser was completed on 23 January 1900, and was placed in reserve until her commissioning on 10 July 1900.

==Operational history==
&quot;Pioneer&quot; spent the majority of 1900 in British waters, before sailing for the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Commander Hugh Evan-Thomas on 15 November. Commander George Hope was appointed in command on 5 July 1902, taking up the command later that month after a visit by the ship to Brindisi. In late December 1902 she was in Greek waters when she visited Astakos in the Ionian Sea with HMS &quot;Irresistible&quot; and HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until returning to Chatham on 20 November 1904. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was decommissioned until 5 September 1905, when she was reactivated for service as a drill ship with the Australian Squadron of the Royal Navy.

On 29 November 1912, &quot;Pioneer&quot; was decommissioned and gifted to the Australian government, who commissioned the ship as part of the Royal Australian Navy on 1 March 1913. Initially used as a tender for the naval base at Garden Island, New South Wales, &quot;Pioneer&quot; was refitted during the second half of 1913, and on 1 January 1914, was reassigned for reservist training.

At the start of World War I, &quot;Pioneer&quot; sailed from Victoria to Western Australia, where she served as a patrol vessel. On 16 August, she captured the German merchant ship &quot;Neumunster&quot;, which was taken by the Australian government as a prize of war and renamed &quot;Cooee&quot;. Ten days later, the cruiser captured a second German ship, the Norddeutscher Lloyd liner &quot;Thuringen&quot;, which was presented to the government of India for use as a troop transport. On 1 November, &quot;Pioneer&quot; joined the escort of the convoy transporting the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to Egypt as a replacement for the Japanese cruiser &quot;Nisshin&quot;, and with orders to check on the Cocos Islands during the voyage. However, as the Australian warship took up position, she suffered a major engine malfunction, and joined the convoy instead.
In late December, the cruiser was assigned to the blockade of German East Africa, and sailed for Zanzibar on 9 January 1915. On arrival, &quot;Pioneer&quot; was ordered to help contain the German cruiser in the Rufiji River and prevent German supply ships from arriving. &quot;Königsberg&quot; was scuttled on 12 July following shelling by two monitors, although &quot;Pioneer&quot; remained in the region until 31 August, when she sailed to Simon&#x27;s Town in South Africa for a six-week refit. &quot;Pioneer&quot; returned to uneventful patrols of German East Africa on 22 October, and continued until early February 1916, when the Admiralty instructed the ship to return to Australia. However, before she could leave, demands by General Jan Smuts for more Admiralty involvement in the East African Campaign saw &quot;Pioneer&quot; return to patrols on 24 February. On 30 July, the cruiser fired 100 4-inch shells during the bombardment of Dar-es-Salaam.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Pioneer&quot; was ordered to return to Australia on 8 August 1916, and was paid off on 7 November 1916. Despite being &quot;obsolete and decrepit&quot; she saw more actual combat than any other Australian ship of World War I. &quot;Pioneer&quot; returned to Garden Island and was used as an accommodation vessel until 1922. She was handed to Cockatoo Island Dockyard for stripping in May 1923, was passed to the control of the Commonwealth Shipping Board in 1924, who then sold the hulk to H. P. Stacey of Sydney, in 1926. The ship was scuttled off Sydney Heads on 18 February 1931.

==Wreck==
The location of the wreck was lost until March 2014, when it was rediscovered by wreck-hunters analysing data taken from the research vessel &quot;Southern Surveyor&quot;. &quot;Pioneer&quot;″s wreck sits below sea level, at , approximately east of Vaucluse. The wreck lies with the bow towards the south-east, and is intact in places, with structures rising up to from the sea floor.

==Honours and awards==
Following a reorganisation of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, &quot;Pioneer&quot; was retroactively awarded the honour &quot;German East Africa 1915–16&quot; in recognition of her wartime service.

<text>The Council of Science Editors (CSE), formerly the Council of Biology Editors (CBE; 1965–2000) and originally the Conference of Biology Editors (CBE; 1957–1965), is a United States–based nonprofit organization that supports editorial practice among scientific writers. In 2008, the CSE adopted the slogan &quot;CSE: Education, Ethics, and Evidence for Editors (E4)&quot;.

A volunteer board of directors leads the Council, with the assistance of several committees. CSE is managed by Riggs Enterprise Corp, located in New Jersey. 

== History and organization==

The organization was established in 1957 by the National Science Foundation and the American Institute of Biological Sciences as the Conference of Biology Editors (CBE). In 1965, the organization incorporated as the Council of Biology Editors &quot;and soon thereafter expanded membership to include all scientific publishing endeavors from science editors to copy editors.&quot; On January 1, 2000, it was renamed the Council of Science Editors.

The membership of CSE comprises editorial professionals, mainly in the United States.

As well as providing services and advice online, CSE holds an annual meeting that includes short courses on topics such as journal editorship, publication management, manuscript editing, and journal metrics.

== Publications ==
CSE publishes a style guide for scientific papers, &quot;Scientific Style and Format: The CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers&quot;, although CSE style is not as widely used as other scientific styles such as AMA style and APA style. In 2014 and 2024, CSE partnered with the University of Chicago Press to use the successful online platform of &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; (&quot;CMOS&quot; or &quot;CMS&quot;; which provides users with search and personal annotation of the manual) to publish &quot;Scientific Style and Format&quot; online. As of 2024, it is in the 9th edition. The 8th edition was published in 2014, the 7th edition in 2006, and the 6th in 1994. &quot;Science Editor&quot; is the quarterly publication of the CSE; after one year, articles are available as open access (delayed open access).

<text>Robert Lee Stewart (born August 13, 1942) is an American retired military officer and NASA astronaut who was a brigadier general of the United States Army.

==Personal==
Stewart was born August 13, 1942, in Washington, D.C. He graduated from Hattiesburg High School in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in 1960. He also received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1964, and a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1972. Stewart is married and has two children.

His interests include woodworking, photography, and skiing.

==Military career==
Stewart entered on active duty with the United States Army in May 1964 and was assigned as an air defense artillery director at the 32nd NORAD Region Headquarters (SAGE), Gunter Air Force Base, Alabama. In July 1966, after completing rotary wing training at Fort Wolters, Texas, and Fort Rucker, Alabama, he was designated an Army Aviator. He flew 1,035 hours of combat time during Vietnam War from August 1966 to 1967, primarily as a fire team leader in the armed helicopter platoon of &quot;A&quot; Company, 101st Aviation Battalion (redesignated 336th Assault Helicopter Company). He was an instructor pilot at the U.S. Army Primary Helicopter School—serving one year in the pre-solo/primary-1 phase of instruction and about 6 months as commander of methods of instruction flight III, training rated aviators to become instructor pilots. He is a graduate of the U.S. Army Air Defense Artillery School&#x27;s Air Defense Officers Advanced Course and Guided Missile Systems Officers Course. Stewart served in Seoul, South Korea, from 1972 to 1973, with the 309th Aviation Battalion (Combat) as a battalion operations officer and battalion executive officer. He next attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, completing the Rotary Wing Test Pilot Course in 1974, and was then assigned as an experimental test pilot to the U.S. Army Aviation Engineering Flight Activity at Edwards Air Force Base, California. His duties there included chief of the integrated systems test division, as well as participating in engineering flight tests of UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters and U-21 and OV-1 fixed wing aircraft, serving as project officer and senior test pilot on the Hughes YAH-64 advanced attack helicopter during government competitive testing; and participation with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation test pilots in developing an electronic automatic flight control system for the new Army transport helicopter—the UH-60A Black Hawk.

He has military and civilian experience in 38 types of airplanes and helicopters and logged approximately 6,000 hours total flight time.

==NASA career==

Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, Stewart became a NASA astronaut in August 1979. His technical duties in the Astronaut Office included: testing and evaluation of the entry flight control systems for STS-1 (the first Space Shuttle orbital mission), ascent abort procedures development, and payload coordination. He also served as support crewman for STS-4, and Ascent/Orbit CAPCOM for STS-5. He served as a mission specialist on STS-41-B in 1984 and STS-51-J in 1985, and logged a total of 289 hours in space, including approximately 12 hours of EVA operations.

Although astronauts who had served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II (including Gus Grissom and Deke Slayton) had previously flown, Stewart was the first active-duty Army officer to make a spaceflight.

While in training for his scheduled third flight (STS-61-K, ultimately cancelled as a result of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster) in 1986, Stewart was selected by the Army for promotion to brigadier general. Upon accepting this promotion, Stewart was reassigned from NASA to be the Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command, in Huntsville, Alabama. In this capacity, Stewart managed research efforts in developing ballistic missile defense technology. He was reassigned as Director of Plans, United States Space Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1989.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-41-B &quot;Challenger&quot; (February 3–11, 1984) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land there 8 days later. During the mission, Stewart and fellow astronaut Bruce McCandless participated in two extravehicular activities (EVAs) to conduct first flight evaluations of the Manned Maneuvering Units (MMUs). These EVAs represented man&#x27;s first untethered operations from a spacecraft in flight. Upon completion of this mission Stewart became the first Army officer awarded the Army Astronaut Badge.

Stewart first EVA, together with Bruce McCandless lasted 6 hours and 17 minutes. During the second EVA, Stewart used the MMU for an untethered spacewalk, lasted 5 hours and 55 minutes.

STS-51-J &quot;Atlantis&quot; (October 3–7, 1985) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and after 98 hours of orbital operations returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the second Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, and the maiden voyage of &quot;Atlantis&quot;. During the mission, he was responsible for a number of on-orbit activities.

==Later career==

Stewart retired from the Army in 1992 and made his home in Woodland Park, Colorado, for many years. He was employed as director of advanced programs at the Nichols Research Corporation in Colorado Springs, Colorado, before retiring. He later moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where he currently resides. He makes appearances at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center, greeting visitors and signing autographs.

==Organizations==
He has been a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Association of Space Explorers, Phi Eta Sigma, and the Scabbard and Blade (a military honor society).

<doc id="529677" wikidata="Q422476" url="?curid=529677" title="Phosphatase">
<text>In biochemistry, a phosphatase is an enzyme that uses water to cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes are essential to many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling. Whereas phosphatases remove phosphate groups from molecules, kinases catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups to molecules from ATP. Together, kinases and phosphatases direct a form of post-translational modification that is essential to the cell&#x27;s regulatory network. 

Phosphatase enzymes are not to be confused with phosphorylase enzymes, which catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from hydrogen phosphate to an acceptor. Due to their prevalence in cellular regulation, phosphatases are an area of interest for pharmaceutical research.

== Biochemistry ==

Phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of a phosphomonoester, removing a phosphate moiety from the substrate. Water is split in the reaction, with the -OH group attaching to the phosphate ion, and the H+ protonating the hydroxyl group of the other product. The net result of the reaction is the destruction of a phosphomonoester and the creation of both a phosphate ion and a molecule with a free hydroxyl group.

Phosphatases are able to dephosphorylate seemingly different sites on their substrates with great specificity. Identifying the &quot;phosphatase code,&quot; that is, the mechanisms and rules that govern substrate recognition for phosphatases, is still a work in progress, but the first comparative analysis of all the protein phosphatases encoded across nine eukaryotic &#x27;phosphatome&#x27; genomes is now available. Studies reveal that so called &quot;docking interactions&quot; play a significant role in substrate binding. A phosphatase recognizes and interacts with various motifs (elements of secondary structure) on its substrate; these motifs bind with low affinity to docking sites on the phosphatase, which are not contained within its active site. Although each individual docking interaction is weak, many interactions occur simultaneously, conferring a cumulative effect on binding specificity. Docking interactions can also allosterically regulate phosphatases and thus influence their catalytic activity.

== Functions ==
In contrast to kinases, phosphatase enzymes recognize and catalyze a wider array of substrates and reactions. For example, in humans, Ser/Thr kinases outnumber Ser/Thr phosphatases by a factor of ten. To some extent, this disparity results from incomplete knowledge of the human phosphatome, that is, the complete set of phosphatases expressed in a cell, tissue, or organism. Many phosphatases have yet to be discovered, and for numerous known phosphatases, a substrate has yet to be identified. However, among well-studied phosphatase/kinase pairs, phosphatases exhibit greater variety than their kinase counterparts in both form and function; this may result from the lesser degree of conservation among phosphatases.

=== Distinctions ===
Phosphatases should not be confused with phosphorylases, which add phosphate groups.

=== Protein phosphatases ===
A protein phosphatase is an enzyme that dephosphorylates an amino acid residue of its protein substrate. Whereas protein kinases act as signaling molecules by phosphorylating proteins, phosphatases remove the phosphate group, which is essential if the system of intracellular signaling is to be able to reset for future use. The tandem work of kinases and phosphatases constitute a significant element of the cell&#x27;s regulatory network. Phosphorylation (and dephosphorylation) is among the most common modes of posttranslational modification in proteins, and it is estimated that, at any given time, up to 30% of all proteins are phosphorylated.

Two notable protein phosphatases are PP2A and PP2B. PP2A is involved in multiple regulatory processes, such as DNA replication, metabolism, transcription, and development. PP2B, also called calcineurin, is involved in the proliferation of T cells; because of this, it is the target of some drugs that seek to suppress the immune system.

=== Nucleotidases ===

A nucleotidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a nucleotide, forming a nucleoside and a phosphate ion. Nucleotidases are essential for cellular homeostasis, because they are partially responsible for maintaining a balanced ratio of nucleotides to nucleosides. Some nucleotidases function outside the cell, creating nucleosides that can be transported into the cell and used to regenerate nucleotides via salvage pathways. Inside the cell, nucleotidases may help to maintain energy levels under stress conditions. A cell deprived of oxygen and nutrients may catabolize more nucleotides to boost levels of nucleoside triphosphates such as ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell.

=== In gluconeogenesis ===
Phosphatases can also act on carbohydrates, such as intermediates in gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is a biosynthetic pathway wherein glucose is created from noncarbohydrate precursors; the pathway is essential because many tissues can only derive energy from glucose. Two phosphatases, glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, catalyze irreversible steps in gluconeogenesis. Each cleaves a phosphate group from a six-carbon sugar phosphate intermediate.

Within the larger class of phosphatase, the Enzyme Commission recognizes 104 distinct enzyme families. Phosphatases are classified by substrate specificity and sequence homology in catalytic domains. Despite their classification into over one hundred families, all phosphatases still catalyze the same general hydrolysis reaction.

In in-vitro experiments, phosphatase enzymes seem to recognize many different substrates, and one substrate may be recognized by many different phosphatases. However, when experiments have been carried out in-vivo, phosphatase enzymes have been shown to be incredibly specific. In some cases, a protein phosphatase (i.e. one defined by its recognition of protein substrates) can catalyze the dephosphorylation of nonprotein substrates. Similarly, dual-specificity tyrosine phosphatases can dephosphorylate not only tyrosine residues, but also serine residues. Thus, one phosphatase can exhibit the qualities of multiple phosphatase families.

<text>HMAS &quot;Pirie&quot; (J189/B249/A123), named for the city of Port Pirie, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II and one of 20 built on Admiralty order but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Early in her career, &quot;Pirie&quot; operated as an escort in the South West Pacific Area, and in April 1943, was damaged off Oro Bay by Japanese aircraft. Tensions between the corvette&#x27;s commanding officer and the rest of the ship&#x27;s company, excaberated by the lack of leave, mail, and pay, boiled over during the repair period, and led to a strike-like mutiny by the junior sailors shortly after &quot;Pirie&quot; returned to service. The mutiny was poorly handled, and the commander was replaced at the end of 1943. During 1944, the ship continued to operate as a convoy escort, and undertook minesweeping duties until she was attached to the British Pacific Fleet. &quot;Pirie&quot; was the third RAN ship to enter Japanese waters, and was present at Japan&#x27;s surrender.

After the war, the corvette returned to Australia, and was decommissioned before being sold to Turkey. Renamed TCG &quot;Amasra&quot;, the ship remained in service with the Turkish Navy until 26 March 1984.

== Design and construction ==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Pirie&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and four for the Royal Indian Navy.

The corvette was initially fitted with a 12-pounder gun as primary armament; this was later replaced by a . Three Oerlikons made up the secondary armament. The aftmost Oerlikon was later switched out in favour of a Bofors. An assortment of machine guns were carried for close-in defence, and depth charge throwers and rails were fitted for anti-submarine warfare.

&quot;Pirie&quot; was laid down by BHP at its Whyalla shipyard on 19 May 1941. She was launched on 3 December 1941 by Mrs. H. T. Kleeman, wife of the Whyalla superintendent of BHP.&quot;Pirie&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 10 October 1942, with Lieutenant Commander Charles Ferry Mills in command.

== Operational history ==
The corvette was initially assigned to escort duties in the South West Pacific Area.

=== Oro Bay ===
On 11 April 1943, &quot;Pirie&quot; was escorting the British supply ship SS &quot;Hanyang&quot; from Milne Bay to Oro Bay. The ships were from their destination when they were attacked by Japanese dive-bombers. The first wave saw &quot;Hanyang&quot;″s steering gear damaged, while &quot;Pirie&quot; was straddled by bombs but escaped effectively unharmed. One dive-bomber was shot down by the corvette&#x27;s retaliatory fire. A second pass by the aircraft caused further damage to the merchantman.

A Zero dived on &quot;Pirie&quot;, strafing the foredeck and the crew of the 12-pounder while the corvette&#x27;s starboard Oerlikon shot back. The bomber dropped two bombs: &quot;Pirie&quot; turned to port to avoid one, but moved directly under the other. The bomb penetrated the armoured bridge canopy, deflected off the helmsman&#x27;s station, killed the gunnery officer, then struck the foredeck plating and detonated, where it killed six of the seven men on the main gun. Had it not struck the bridge first, the bomb would likely had penetrated the magazine before detonating and destroying the entire ship.

&quot;Pirie&quot; was strafed another three times before the Japanese planes were driven off by Allied fighters and anti-aircraft fire from the corvette. In addition to the seven crew killed in the attack, four were seriously wounded. Japanese propaganda, describing the corvette as a destroyer, reported that she had been destroyed. Three United States Army personnel aboard &quot;Pirie&quot; at the time (a chaplain and two officers) offered to bury the dead at sea. The chaplain later recommended that the ship and her company receive bravery honours. Both ships reached their destination.

After some repairs were effected at Oro Bay, escorted &quot;Pirie&quot; back to Milne Bay. Further temporary repairs were made, and on 14 April, the corvette sailed for Townsville in company with the sloop , before continuing on alone to Maryborough, where she arrived on 19 April.

=== Repairs and mutiny ===
During Mills&#x27; time in command, he had been a strict disciplinarian, required sailors to wear dress uniforms when going ashore, and over-enforced the division between officers and sailors. Mills also treated both sailors and subordinate officers with contempt: as the only member of the Permanent Navy (as opposed to the Reserve or &#x27;Hostilities Only&#x27; recruits), he considered himself superior to all else aboard. The entire ship&#x27;s company quickly came to dislike him, and any respect for him was further undermined during the air attack at Oro Bay: sailors had witnessed Mills dive for cover when the Japanese planes attacked, forcing the Coxswain to take over and fight. Mills also took to wearing a sling, despite not being wounded.

On coming alongside in Maryborough, the personnel of &quot;Pirie&quot; found that only some of their expected mail had arrived, and there was no sign of their pay. A small number of sailors were allowed home on leave, but Mills ordered the rest to remain aboard the corvette while the foredeck was stripped off and replaced, which made living conditions in the already poor messdecks much worse: those aboard were exposed to the noise of repair work, tropical heat, and ankle-deep water in the living areas. The commander himself moved ashore to a hotel, but visited the ship daily to take local dignitaries on tours and spoke of the attack. Mills&#x27; wife had travelled to Maryborough, and the ship&#x27;s men were expected to salute her as if she was a naval officer. A complaint about the living conditions was made to the Coxswain to pass on to Mills, but the commander was uncompassionate. Repairs were completed on 18 May, and &quot;Pirie&quot; sailed to Townsville to await reassignment. An expected leave period before resuming duties did not eventuate. The corvette was instructed to commence patrol and escort duties along Australia&#x27;s east coast, to which Mills responded with . The signalman informed his shipmates of the response: some sailors later wrote that this was &quot;the last straw&quot;.

&quot;Pirie&quot; completed her first escort run in late May: she escorted two ships from Townsville to Sydney, then joined a convoy of fourteen merchant ships and five other corvettes back to Townsville. The mood of the ship&#x27;s company continued to deteriorate, and on 8 June, a large number of sailors met in the foremost messdeck. A complaint about the living conditions was made to the coxswain to pass on to Mills, but the commander was uncompassionate. They wanted to highlight their grievances and requests—a short period of shore leave while &quot;Pirie&quot; was inactive, their overdue mail to be sent to the ship, and their pay to be delivered—and resolved that the next morning, instead of reporting for duty, half the junior sailors and half the stokers would, instead of reporting for duty, &quot;sit here and see what happens&quot;. Older sailors and anyone above the rank of able seaman were not allowed to participate, so the corvette could deploy immediately if necessary and to ensure there were no repercussions for those who had families to support and might wish to continue their naval career after the war.

The next morning, when the order to assemble for morning duties was piped, 45 men failed to respond, and asked to discuss their grievances with Mills. Mills instructed the First Lieutenant and the Coxswain to order the sailors to the quarterdeck. Each sailor was given a direct order, and when all had refused, they were deemed to be in a state of mutiny. The sailors did not know how to proceed, so continued to sit and wait in the messdecks. The Coxswain returned to collect a list of grievances, and was met by shouts from all sides, some of which had little or no connection to the sailors&#x27; original reasonings. Another pipe, this time for all personnel to assemble aft, was made, and again, the 45 sailors stayed where they were. Mills, who had received the list, informed those assembled how disappointed he was in the actions of the ship&#x27;s company, then went ashore to meet with the Naval Officer in Charge (NOIC). Although attending the midday meal, the 45 sailors did not report for afternoon duties, and it was not until 1720, with the NOIC aboard, that they obeyed an order to fall in with the rest of the ship&#x27;s company on the aft quarterdeck. During the afternoon, an armed guard was stationed on the dock alongside &quot;Pirie&quot;, and the ship&#x27;s 12-pounder had been disabled. After reading the relevant passages from the &quot;Articles of War&quot;, the NOIC instructed anyone unwilling to work to stand aside; nobody did. The ship&#x27;s company were informed that &quot;Pirie&quot; would sail for Cid Harbour that evening.

On arrival at Cid Harbour early on 10 June, Mills was informed that a Board of Inquiry, consisting of senior officers from HMA Ships and would be convened at 1100. Twenty-four sailors were called before the Inquiry, and had to testify without formal representation. As the Inquiry was unable to identify any ringleaders, the problem was handed back to Mills to deal with as he saw fit. On 15 June, Mills summarily charged twelve men with joining a mutinous assembly (including one who had not participated), and two others with disobeying instructions to persuade the others to return to duty. Ten were sent to Stuart&#x27;s Creek Gaol for periods between 21 and 60 days, then assigned to other ships, while the other four were punished less severely and remained aboard. This was despite the &quot;Articles of War&quot; prohibiting charges of mutiny being laid without a court martial, and no opportunity to defend themselves or request clemency was offered. The sailors claimed that the decision to disobey orders had come from a consensus of frustration, and later theorised that those punished had either witnessed the commander&#x27;s actions during the air attack, or were the ones most likely to speak up for themselves against Mills.

The evidence collected by the Inquiry led the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board to conclude that Mills had failed to respond quickly and appropriately to the sailors&#x27; actions, and he was transferred to the training base in December. &quot;Pirie&quot; continued on convoy duties until sailing to Sydney for a refit in December. During his final months in command, Mills attempted to reassert his authority through the use of increasingly frequent disciplinary punishments for minor breaches, such as failing to properly lash hammocks, or washing clothes in the wrong place. Mills&#x27; replacement, Lieutenant Commander D. L. Thompson, noted a dramatic improvement in the attitude and discipline of the ship&#x27;s company when he took command.

=== 1944–45 ===

After the December 1943 refit, &quot;Pirie&quot; was assigned to patrol and escort duties out of Darwin. During the second half of 1944, the ship operated in the Great Barrier Reef as a minesweeper. In November, &quot;Pirie&quot; was attached to the British Pacific Fleet&#x27;s Minesweeping Flotilla.

In July 1945, the corvette was used as a convoy escort off Okinawa and Iwo Jima. &quot;Pirie&quot; was the third Australian warship to enter Japanese territorial waters during the war, entering Tokyo Bay on 31 August 1945. She remained in Tokyo Bay until mid-September and was present on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed.

&quot;Pirie&quot;″s wartime service is recognised by three battle honours: &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.
=== Post-war handover ===
&quot;Pirie&quot; returned to Sydney in February 1946. She was decommissioned from RAN service on 5 April, and was immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Pirie&quot;. On 21 May, &quot;Pirie&quot;, along with sister ships and , sailed for Colombo for transfer into the Turkish Navy.

=== Turkish service ===
Renamed TCG &quot;Amasra&quot;, the ship remained in service with the Turkish Navy until 26 March 1984.

<text>Castleton University was a public university in Castleton, Vermont.

In July 2023, Castleton University ceased operations as an independent university after a merger with Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College, forming Vermont State University, of which it now serves as a branch campus. Upon Castleton&#x27;s dissolution, it was the 18th oldest university in the nation.

At the time of its closure, Castleton had an enrollment of 2000 students and offered more than 30 undergraduate programs, as well as master&#x27;s degrees. It was accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==History==
Castleton University traced its history to the Rutland County Grammar School, chartered by the Vermont General Assembly on October 15, 1787. The Grammar School was a regional school, preparing young men for college through instruction in traditional academic subjects such as Latin and Greek. The institution frequently changed its name during the 19th century. At various times it was known as Castleton Academy, Castleton Academy and Female Seminary, Vermont Classical High School (1828–1830), and Castleton Seminary (1830–1876).

In 1823, instruction in &quot;the solid branches of female education&quot; began for &quot;young Ladies and Misses&quot;. By the time of the Civil War, the majority of the students attending Castleton were young women.

In 1829, a three-story brick building costing US$30,000 was constructed on a small hill south of the village. Principal Solomon Foot (1826–1829), who would go on to be President &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the U.S. Senate during the Civil War, was the driving force in this expansion of the school. The Seminary Building (eventually known as the Old Seminary Building) was the most impressive structure in the village, but expensive to maintain and often too large for the school&#x27;s struggling enrollment.

Castleton Medical College (1818–1862) was also located in the village. It graduated 1400 students, more than any other medical school in New England at the time. Although Castleton Medical College and Castleton Seminary were separate institutions, they often shared faculty. Today the former medical college building, known as the Old Chapel, is the oldest building on the campus.

The first female principal was Harriet Newell Haskell (1862–1867). She had attended the Seminary as a child, took classes at Middlebury College without being permitted to matriculate, and then attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, which was not yet a college but offered a college-level curriculum for women. Although Haskell was in her 20s when she served as principal, the school flourished under her administration. With her departure to be principal of Monticello Ladies Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, Castleton Seminary went into decline.

The school began its transition from seminary to college in 1867, when the State Normal School at Castleton was founded as one of three state normal schools chartered by Vermont.

Normal schools educated students for teaching careers. For 30 years the Normal School property and grounds were privately owned by Abel E. Leavenworth and his son Philip. In 1912, the State of Vermont purchased the property, and the name of the school changed slightly to Castleton Normal School in 1920.

In the 1920s and 1930s, under the direction of Caroline S. Woodruff, the college experienced dramatic growth in students and its stature. Woodruff modernized the school&#x27;s curriculum, incorporating the theories of Vermont educator-philosopher John Dewey, especially his precepts of &quot;learning by doing&quot; and &quot;learning by teaching&quot;. She hired staff with advanced degrees, and broadened her students&#x27; exposure to the world by bringing people such as Helen Keller, Robert Frost, and Norman Rockwell to Castleton. Woodruff was the first and only Vermonter to become president of the National Education Association.

In 1947, the Normal School became Castleton Teachers College. With increased enrollment from men, intercollegiate athletics began in the 1950s.

In 1962, the institution became Castleton State College when it joined other state-supported colleges in becoming a part of the Vermont State Colleges, a consortium of colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor, and Council of Presidents, each college having its own president and deans.

In 1979, the board of trustees proposed a name change to Southern Vermont State College; the proposal was never acted on. On July 23, 2015, the Vermont State Colleges Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the institution to Castleton University.

Nearby Rutland plays host to the Castleton Polling Institute, as well as a professional development center for educators and entrepreneurs. In September 2016, the university opened Foley Hall, a two-floor residence, in collaboration with Green Mountain Power and Efficiency Vermont that provides housing for students. Castleton extended its reach into Bennington County in 2019, when it began a partnership with Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington to host its B.S. registered nurse program after the closure of Southern Vermont College that year. Castleton collaborates with Vermont Technical College in the nursing program, whose offices are housed in the Bjur Building (otherwise known as the Vermont Mill).

==Castleton Polling Institute==
In 2012, Castleton began the Castleton Polling Institute with an initial investment of $100,000. The institute&#x27;s founding director, Rich Clark, a professor of political science, had been working in academia and polling for 15 years before coming to Castleton in 2011 from the University of Georgia.

The first poll was conducted from February 11 to February 22, 2012, and polled Vermont voters about the 2012 Presidential Primaries. Since the first poll, the Polling Institute has conducted over 30 public opinion and public policy polls for state agencies, non-profits, and media organizations.

<doc id="529681" wikidata="Q561487" url="?curid=529681" title="Sourav Ganguly">
<text>Sourav Chandidas Ganguly (; natively spelled as Gangopadhyay; born 8 July 1972), also known as Dada (meaning &quot;elder brother&quot; in Bengali), is an Indian cricket commentator and former cricketer. He is popularly called the &quot;Maharaja of Indian Cricket&quot;. He was captain of the Indian national cricket team and is regarded as one of India&#x27;s most successful cricket captains. As captain, he led Indian national team to win the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and reach the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the 2000 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2004 Asia Cup.

Ganguly scored 11363 runs in his ODI career which stands at ninth position in the world for most runs scored in ODI matches. He was the third batsman to cross the 10,000 runs in One day cricket, after Sachin Tendulkar and Inzamam Ul Haq. He holds the record for highest score in an innings (183) by an Indian batsman in the ODI Cricket World Cup. In 2002, the &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; ranked him the sixth greatest ODI batsman of all time. He announced his retirement from international cricket in 2008 and from all forms of cricket in 2012.

Ganguly was awarded the fourth highest Indian civilian award, Padma Shri in 2004. He was elected as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India in 2019. He is also a part of the Supreme Court of India appointed probe panel for the IPL Spot fixing and betting scandal&#x27;s investigations.

== Early and personal life ==

Sourav Ganguly was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta, and is the youngest son of Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly. Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the &#x27;Maharaj&#x27;, meaning the &quot;Great King&quot;. Ganguly&#x27;s father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness.

Ganguly was educated at St. Xavier&#x27;s Collegiate School, Kolkata. He was then graduated in commerce from the St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Kolkata.

Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly&#x27;s dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth standard at that time.

Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother&#x27;s sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier&#x27;s School&#x27;s cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.

He is married to Indian classical dancer dancer Dona Ganguly, with whom he has a daughter Sana (b. 2001).

=== Health ===
On 2 January 2021, Ganguly complained of chest pain while exercising and was later diagnosed with three blocked coronary arteries which had led to a mild heart attack. He underwent primary angioplasty for one of the blockages on the same day.

== Playing career ==
=== 1990–96: Career beginning and debut success ===

Following a prolific Ranji season in 1990–91, Ganguly scored three runs in his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against the West Indies in 1992. He was dropped immediately since he was perceived to be &quot;arrogant&quot; and his attitude towards the game was openly questioned. It was rumoured that Ganguly refused to carry drinks for his teammates, commenting that it was not his job to do so, later denied by him. Consequently, he was removed from the team. He toiled away in domestic cricket, scoring heavily in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 Ranji seasons. Following an innings of 171 in the 1995–96 Duleep Trophy, he was recalled to the Indian team for a tour of England in 1996, in the middle of intense media scrutiny. He played in a single ODI, but was omitted from the team for the first Test. However, after teammate Navjot Singh Sidhu left the touring party, citing ill-treatment by then captain Mohammad Azharuddin, Ganguly made his Test debut against England in the Second Test of a three-match series at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground along with Rahul Dravid. England had won the First Test of the three-match series; however, Ganguly scored a century, becoming only the third cricketer to achieve such a feat on debut at Lord&#x27;s, after Harry Graham and John Hampshire. Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior have since accomplished this feat, but Ganguly&#x27;s 131 still remains the highest by any batsman on his debut at the ground. India was not required to bat in the second innings due to the match ending in a draw. In the next Test match at Trent Bridge he made 136, thus becoming only the third batsman to make a century in each of his first two innings (after Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran). He shared a 255 run stand with Sachin Tendulkar, which became at that time the highest partnership for India against any country for any wicket outside India. The Test again ended in a draw, handing England a 1–0 series victory; Ganguly scored 48 in the second innings.

=== 1997–99: Marriage, Opening in ODIs and World Cup &#x27;99 ===

Weeks after his successful tour of England, Ganguly eloped with childhood sweetheart Dona Roy. The bride and groom&#x27;s family were sworn enemies at that point and this news caused an uproar between them. However, both families reconciled and a formal wedding was held in February 1997. Same year, Ganguly scored his maiden ODI century by hitting 113, opposed to Sri Lanka&#x27;s team total of 238. Later that year, he won four consecutive man of the match awards, in the Sahara Cup with Pakistan; the second of these was won after he took five wickets for 16 runs off 10 overs, his best bowling in an ODI. After a barren run in Test cricket his form returned at the end of the year with three centuries in four Tests, all against Sri Lanka, and two of these involved stands with Sachin Tendulkar of over 250.

During the third final of the Independence Cup at Dhaka in January 1998, India successfully chased down 315 off 48 overs, and Ganguly won the Man of the Match award. In March 1998 he was part of the Indian team that defeated Australia; in Kolkata, he took three wickets having opened the bowling with his medium pace.

Ganguly was part of the Indian team that competed in the 1999 World Cup in England. During the match against Sri Lanka at Taunton, India chose to bat. After Sadagoppan Ramesh was bowled, Ganguly scored 183 from 158 balls, and hit 17 fours and seven sixes. It was the second highest score in World Cup history and the highest by an Indian in the tournament at the time. His partnership of 318 with Rahul Dravid is the highest overall score in a World Cup and is the second highest in all ODI cricket. In 1999–00, India lost Test series to both Australia and South Africa that involved a combined total of five Tests. Ganguly struggled scoring 224 runs at 22.40; however his ODI form was impressive, with five centuries over the season taking him to the top of the PwC One Day Ratings for batsmen. Around the same time, allegations came that Ganguly was romantically involved with South Indian actress Nagma, something he denied.

=== 2000–05: Ascension to captaincy and accolades ===

In 2000, after the match fixing scandal by some of the players of the team, Ganguly was named the captain of the Indian cricket team. The decision was spurred due to Tendulkar stepping down from the position for his health, and Ganguly being the vice-captain at that time. He began well as a captain, leading India to a series win over South Africa in the five-match one day series and led the Indian team to the finals of the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy. He scored two centuries, including one in the final; however, New Zealand still won by four wickets. The same year, Ganguly tried his hand at county cricket career in England but was not successful. In &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&quot;, reviewers Steve Pittard and John Stern called him as &quot;The imperious Indian—dubbed &#x27;Lord Snooty&#x27;&quot;. They commented:
&quot;At the crease it was sometimes uncertain whether his partner was a batsman or a batman being dispatched to take his discarded sweater to the pavilion or carry his kit bag. But mutiny was afoot among the lower orders. In one match Ganguly, after reaching his fifty, raised his bat to the home balcony, only to find it deserted. He did not inspire at Glamorgan or Northamptonshire either. At the latter in 2006 he averaged 4.80 from his four first-class appearances.&quot;

His Lancashire teammate Andrew Flintoff thought him to be aloof and compared his attitude to that of Prince Charles. In Australia&#x27;s three Test and five-match ODI tour of India in early 2001, Ganguly caused controversy by arriving late for the toss on four occasions, something that agitated opposing captain Steve Waugh. In the Fourth ODI, he caused further controversy by failing to wear his playing attire to the toss, something considered unusual in cricket circles. However, India won the Test series 2–1, ending Australia&#x27;s run of 16 consecutive Test match victories in the Second Test. The match saw India looking set for defeat after conceding a first innings lead of 274. Waugh chose to enforce the follow-on and V. V. S. Laxman (281) and Rahul Dravid (180) batted for the entire fourth day&#x27;s play to set Australia a target of 384 on a dusty, spinning wicket. The Australians were unable to survive and became only the third team to lose a Test after enforcing the follow-on. In November 2001, Ganguly&#x27;s wife Dona gave birth to their daughter Sana. During the final match of the 2002 NatWest Series held in Lords after a stunning performance by teammates Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif, Ganguly took off his shirt in public and brandished it in the air to celebrate India&#x27;s winning of the match. He was later strongly condemned for tarnishing the &quot;gentleman&#x27;s game&quot; image of cricket and disrespecting Lord&#x27;s protocol. Ganguly said that he was only mimicking an act performed by the British all-rounder Andrew Flintoff during a tour of India. In 2003, India reached the World Cup Final for the first time since 1983, where they lost to the Australians. Ganguly had a successful tournament personally, scoring 465 runs at an average of 58.12, including three centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Ganguly / One-Day Internationals / Series averages&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


By 2004, he had achieved significant success as captain and was deemed as India&#x27;s most successful cricket captains by sections of the media. However, his individual performance deteriorated during his captaincy reign, especially after the World Cup, the tour of Australia in 2003 and the Pakistan series in 2004. In 2004, Australia won a Test series in India for the first time since 1969. It was speculated that Ganguly was in disagreement with the head of cricket in Nagpur over the type of pitch to be used for the Third Test. The groundsmen went against Ganguly, leaving a large amount of grass on the pitch. Some experts indicated that the reason for this was for &quot;spite or revenge&quot; against the Indian captain. When Australia&#x27;s stand-in-captain, Adam Gilchrist, went to the toss, he noticed Rahul Dravid was waiting instead of Ganguly, leaving him to ask Dravid where Ganguly was. Dravid could not give a definitive answer, saying: &quot;Oh, who knows?&quot;

Following indifferent form in 2004 and poor form in 2005, he was dropped from the team in October 2005. Having been nominated and rejected in 2000, when the game suffered a tarnished reputation due to match fixing scandals, the captaincy was passed to Dravid, his former deputy. Ganguly decided against retiring and attempted to make a comeback to the team. Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution in the field of sports. He was presented with the award on 30 June 2004, by then President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.

=== 2006–07: Comeback and rift with Greg Chappell ===

In September 2005, Greg Chappell became the coach of India for the tour of Zimbabwe. Ganguly&#x27;s dispute with him resulted in many headlines. Chappell had emailed the Board of Control for Cricket in India, stating that Ganguly was &quot;physically and mentally&quot; unfit to lead India and that his &quot;divide and rule&quot; behaviour was damaging the team. This email was leaked to the media and resulted in huge backlash from Ganguly&#x27;s fans. Ganguly had enlisted the support from the Indian media and eventually the board had to intervene and order a truce between the pair. BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra issued a statement that,

&quot;In view of the decision that cricket is to go forward, both the coach and the captain have been asked to work out a mutual and professional working relationship. For this, performance will be the criteria, applicable to captain, coach and players. [...] Of course the captain controls the game, the coach does his own job. Mutual trust is important. Henceforth no player/captain/coach will write or have any interaction with the media. Going to the media will lead to disciplinary action.&quot;
Ganguly, Chappell and the Indian team manager for the Zimbabwe tour, Amitabh Choudhary, were asked to appear before the BCCI committee, where it was reported that assurance of working together was given by them. Consequently, due to his poor form and differences with the coach, Ganguly was dropped as the captain of the team, with Dravid taking his place. Chandresh Narayan, chief correspondent for &quot;The Times of India&quot;, commented that &quot;The row with Greg Chappell just added to the mystery, but he was going through a really bad patch then, his only score [of note] was a hundred against Zimbabwe and that didn&#x27;t count for much.&quot; Ten months later, during India&#x27;s tour to South Africa, Ganguly was recalled after his middle order replacements Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif suffered poor form.

Following India&#x27;s poor batting display in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy and the ODI series in South Africa, in which they were whitewashed 4–0, Ganguly made his comeback to the Test team. Wasim Jaffer, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble had earlier been selected for the one-day squad, despite their recent poor performances. Many saw this as an indictment of coach Greg Chappell&#x27;s youth-first policy. Coming in at 37/4, Ganguly scored 83 in a tour match against the rest of South Africa, modifying his original batting style and taking a middle-stump guard, resulting in India winning the match. During his first Test innings since his comeback, against South Africa in Johannesburg his score of 51 helped India to victory, marking the first Test match win for the team in South Africa. Though India lost the series, Ganguly accumulated the most runs on the scoring chart. After his successful Test comeback he was recalled for the ODI team, as India played host to West Indies and Sri Lanka in back to back ODI tournaments. In his first ODI innings in almost two years, he scored a matchwinning 98. He performed well in both series, averaging almost 70 and won the Man of the Series Award against Sri Lanka.

Ganguly was allotted a place in the official team for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He was the leading scorer for India in their first round defeat against Bangladesh. After India were knocked out of the tournament in the group stage, there were reports of a rift between certain members of the Indian team and Chappell. Ganguly was alleged to have ignored instructions from the team management to score quickly. After Tendulkar issued a statement saying that what hurt the team most was that &quot;the coach has questioned our attitude&quot;, Chappell decided not to renew his contract with the Indian team and left his post as coach, citing &quot;family and personal reasons&quot;. On 12 December 2007, Ganguly scored his maiden double century of his career while playing against Pakistan. He scored 239 runs in the first innings of the third and final Test match of the series. He was involved in a 300  run partnership for the fifth wicket with Yuvraj Singh. Ganguly remained prolific in both Test and ODI cricket in the year 2007. He scored 1106 Test runs at an average of 61.44 (with three centuries and four fifties) in 2007 to become the second highest run-scorer in Test matches of that year after Jacques Kallis. He was also the fifth highest run-scorer in 2007 in ODIs, where he scored 1240 runs at an average of 44.28.

For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World Test XI by ESPNcricinfo.

=== 2008–12: International retirement and IPL ===

In the controversial test vs Australia in January 2008, Ganguly scored half centuries in both the innings in a losing cause.
In February 2008, Ganguly joined as the captain of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team, owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, as part of the Indian Premier League (IPL). On 18 April 2008, Ganguly led the KKR, in the IPL Twenty20 cricket match. They had a 140 run victory over Bangalore Royal Challengers (captained by Rahul Dravid and owned by Vijay Mallya). Ganguly opened the innings with Brendon McCullum and scored 10 runs while McCullum remained unbeaten, scoring 158 runs in 73 balls. On 1 May, in a game between the Knight Riders and the Rajasthan Royals, Ganguly made his second T20 half century, scoring 51 runs off of 39 balls at a strike rate of 130.76. In his innings, Ganguly hit four 4s and two sixes, topping the scorers list for the Knight Riders.

On 7 July 2008, media reported that Ganguly was being projected as a candidate for the post of President of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) against his former mentor Jagmohan Dalmiya. Reports also suggested that he could run for the post of BCCI President in 2014 as East Zone&#x27;s representative. Ganguly himself did not deny the reports and did not rule out any such move. The same year in October, Ganguly announced that the Test series against Australia starting in October 2008 would be his last and stated &quot;[t]o be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect to be picked for this series. Before coming here, [at the conference] I spoke to my team-mates and hopefully I will go out with a winning knock.&quot; Ganguly played in every game of the four-Test series and amassed 324 runs at an average of 54.00. While playing the second Test match of the series in Mohali, Ganguly scored his final test century. In the final test match he played at Nagpur against Australia he scored 85 and 0 in his first and second innings respectively. In the Fourth and final Test, with India needing one wicket to secure a victory, the Indian captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, invited Ganguly to lead the side in the field for the final time. India regained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, winning the series 2–0.

In May 2009, Ganguly was removed from the captaincy of the KKR for the 2009 season of the IPL, and was replaced by McCullum. The decision was questioned by media and other players of the team, when KKR finished at the bottom of the ranking table with three wins and ten losses. After that, Bengali television channel Zee Bangla roped him as the host of the reality quiz show titled &quot;Dadagiri Unlimited&quot;. It presented participants from the 19 districts of West Bengal, who had to answer questions posed by Ganguly. By August, he was appointed the chairman of CAB&#x27;s Cricket Development Committee. The job of the committee is to receive a report from the selectors at the end of every cricket season, assess the accountability of the selectors and make necessary recommendations. He played for the Ranji cup in the Bengal team in October 2009. Ganguly scored 110 in the match against Delhi and was involved in a partnership of 222 runs with Wriddhiman Saha.

In the third season of the IPL, Ganguly was once again given the captaincy of KKR, after the team ended at the bottom in the second season. The coach John Buchanan was replaced by Dav Whatmore. In 40 matches and 38 innings for KKR Ganguly scored 1,031 runs and took eight wickets. In the fourth season of the IPL he was signed by the Pune Warriors India, after being unsold in initial bidding process and he made 50 runs of four matches and three innings.
In the 2012 season he has been appointed as the Captain cum mentor for Pune Warriors India.
On 29 October 2012, he announced that he has decided not to play in next year&#x27;s IPL and to retire from the game.

== 2013–present Administration career ==
Ganguly was part of the Supreme Court of India appointed Justice Mudgal Committee probe panel for the IPL Spot fixing and betting scandal&#x27;s investigations. From 2015 to October 2019, he was the President of the Cricket association of Bengal. In 2018 his autobiographical book &quot;A Century is Not Enough&quot; was published. In March 2019, Ganguly was appointed as the advisor of the Delhi Capitals IPL team. In October 2019 he became President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and President of the editorial board with Wisden India.
Ganguly&#x27;s security cover was upgraded to &#x27;Z&#x27; Category by the West Bengal government. He will now have 8 to 10 police personnel guarding him.

== Playing style and influences ==
Ganguly commented that David Gower was the first cricketer to attract him to the game. He loved Gower&#x27;s style and used to watch old videos of him playing. Other cricketers who had an influence on him are: David Boon, Mohinder Amarnath, Kapil Dev and Allan Border. Ganguly is a left-handed batsman whose runs came primarily from the off-side. Debashish Dutta, author of &quot;Sourav Ganguly, the maharaja of cricket&quot;, commented that throughout his career, &quot;Ganguly played off-side shots such as the square cut, square drive and cover drive with complete command.&quot; Rahul Dravid has called Ganguly &quot;...next to God on the off-side.&quot; He used to hit powerful shots to the off-side on front and back foot with equal ease. However, early in his career he was not comfortable with the hook and pull, often giving his wicket away with mistiming such shots. He was also criticised for having difficulty in handling short bouncers, notoriously exploited by the Australians and South Africans. However, after his comeback in 2007, he worked upon these weaknesses to a large extent.

Amrita Daityari, author of &quot;Sourav Ganguly: the fire within&quot;, noted that in ODIs, where Ganguly usually opened the innings, he used to try to take the advantage of fielding restrictions by advancing down the pitch and hitting pace bowlers over extra cover and mid-off. She commented: &quot;Ganguly was notorious for attacking left-arm spin bowlers. Due to excellent eye–hand coordination, he was noted for picking the length of the ball early, coming down the pitch and hitting the ball aerially over mid-on or midwicket, often for a six. However, he did have a weakness in running between the wickets and judging quick singles.&quot; There were many instances where Ganguly&#x27;s batting partner was run out due to Ganguly&#x27;s calling for a run, and then sending him back while halfway down the pitch. A situation like this happened in an ODI against Australia where he took a single when on 99, but he coasted and did not ground his bat. Although the bat was past the crease, it was in the air and he was consequently run out. Ganguly said, &quot;I love to watch myself hit a cover drive, to watch myself hit a hundred.&quot; Ganguly&#x27;s relationship with former Indian coach John Wright has been well documented in contemporary media, with them denoting the relationship as a &quot;symbiotic process&quot;. They credited Wright and Ganguly with bringing out international class performers, through academic, coaching and scientific fitness regimens. According to Dubey, Ganguly and Wright, along with other members of the team like Tendulkar and Dravid, were the first to understand the importance of a foreign coach for the Indian cricket team and was convinced that the domestic coach has outlived its utility. Ganguly&#x27;s aggressive style and Wright&#x27;s importance on fitness ushered in the development of a better cricket team for India.

Ganguly is a right-arm medium pace bowler. He can swing and seam the ball both ways and often chips in with useful wickets to break partnerships. Vinod Tiwari, author of the biography &quot;Sourav Ganguly&quot; praised him saying &quot;[d]espite not being very athletic as a fielder, Ganguly has taken 100 catches in one-day Internationals. That&#x27;s something to be proud of!&quot; However he criticised Ganguly&#x27;s ground fielding, especially his slowness in intercepting the ball to prevent runs and his tendency to get injured during catching the ball.

== Legacy ==

Author Pradeep Mandhani commented that in his tenure between 2000 and 2005, Ganguly became India&#x27;s most successful Test captain. He led his team to victory on 21 occasions – seven times more than Mohammad Azharuddin with the second most wins—and led them for a record 49 matches—twice more than both Azharuddin and Sunil Gavaskar. Compared to his batting average of 45.47 when not captain, Ganguly&#x27;s Test batting average as captain was a lower 37.66.

Statistics about Ganguly show that he was the seventh Indian cricketer to have played 100 Test matches, the 4th highest overall run scorer for India in Tests, and the fourth Indian to have played in more than 300 ODIs. In terms of overall runs scored in ODIs, Ganguly is the third among Indians after Sachin Tendulkar (who has the most ODI runs) and Virat Kohli and the ninth overall. He has scored 16 centuries in Test matches and 22 in ODIs. He is also one of only ten batsmen to score more than 10,000 runs in ODIs. Along with Tendulkar, Ganguly has formed the most successful opening pair in One Day Cricket, having amassed the highest number of century partnerships (26) for the first wicket. Together, they have scored more than 7000 runs at an average of 48.98, and hold the world record for creating most 50-run partnership in the first wicket (44 fifties). Ganguly became the fourth player to cross 11,000 ODI runs, and was the fastest player to do so in ODI cricket, after Tendulkar. As of 2006, he is the only Indian captain to win a Test series in Pakistan (although two of the three Tests of that series was led by Rahul Dravid). He is also one of the five players in the world to achieve amazing treble of 10,000 runs, 100 wickets and 100 catches in ODI cricket history, the others being Tendulkar, Kallis, Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillakaratne Dilshan.
Author Mihir Bose, in his book, &quot;The magic of Indian cricket: cricket and society in India&quot;. commented that &quot;The cricket world had gotten too used to the stereotype of the meek Indian cricketer. All that has changed under Ganguly, perhaps for the better.&quot; He credits Ganguly for not being shy of taking on responsibility. &quot;He showed that he can be a leader of a team, which has greats like Sachin and Dravid in the side, without any problems. Under Ganguly&#x27;s leadership, India started winning matches and tournaments, previously lacking from the team considerably.&quot; Within a few years of his captaincy, Ganguly rewrote the rules of being a captain of a cricket team. Unlike some of his predecessors, Ganguly was considered impartial, non-parochial, and forever pushed his players to perform better. Off the field, his interactions with the media, his fans, and detractors were uncompromisingly honest and earned him the respect of cricket followers everywhere. However, along with this respect came the criticisms. Ganguly was condemned as a hot-tempered man who refused to listen to other&#x27;s opinions and abided by his own rules and regulations. Matthew Engel, ICC sport critic, noted that this &quot;turning deaf&quot; to other&#x27;s opinions would one day harm Ganguly and that it was sheer luck that he existed on the sporting world.

Ganguly believed that his legacy as a captain was that he was able to build a proper Indian team. He added,

&quot;[We] were able to change the face of Indian cricket. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m proud of, because I think we made a huge difference. People used to think that we would simply roll over when playing out of India, but we changed the image. [...] [The team wouldn&#x27;t take any crap from any opposition] Absolutely, and that came from self-belief that, that we had the ability to do well outside India.&quot;

Bose commented that Ganguly&#x27;s greatest legacy lay in his influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at the receiving end of an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.

Despite his contributions, his captaincy and coaching methods came under immense scrutiny from the press as well as other scholars. Engel commented that &quot;He seems like aloof to the problems that his mal-decisions are creating. I don&#x27;t particularly believe that Ganguly has an &#x27;effing knowledge how to lead his team and tries to counter-pose it with instigating limitless, confrontational behaviours within the younger members of it. [One day] the time will come when such shock tactics will cease to work.&quot; An article on &quot;Cricinfo Magazine&quot; pointed out his reckless behaviour. The reporter Rahul Bhattacharya said, &quot;Generally Ganguly fostered angry or reckless young men. To him &#x27;good behaviour&#x27;, a broad term espoused by the present team management, belonged in school and probably not even there. He himself had been summoned to the match referee no less than 12 times in the last decade. His approach was bound to precipitate what could possibly be termed a cultural conflict in the world of modern sport. For Ganguly, like for Arjuna Ranatunga, competitiveness involved brinksmanship rather than training. As far as they were concerned Australia were not to be aspired to. They were simply to be toppled. England were not to be appeased. Victory lay precisely in their disapproval. In other words, Ganguly and Ranatunga wanted to do things their way.&quot;

<doc id="529682" wikidata="Q4039979" url="?curid=529682" title="HMAS Platypus (1917)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Platypus&quot; was a submarine depot ship and base ship operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) between 1919 and 1946. Ordered prior to World War I to support the Australian submarines and , &quot;Platypus&quot; was not completed until after both submarines had been lost, and she was commissioned into the Royal Navy from 1917 to 1919.

After the RAN acquired six J-class submarines, &quot;Platypus&quot; was recommissioned as an Australian warship. She was repurposed as a destroyer tender after the J class was removed from service in the 1920s, tasked with supporting the two O-class submarines during 1929 and 1930. After the submarines were placed in reserve, &quot;Platypus&quot; was renamed HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot; and operated as a depot ship until 1941. The ship assumed her old name and was relocated to Darwin, then Cairns for use as a base ship. After a refit in 1944, &quot;Platypus&quot; operated as a repair vessel in New Guinea waters until she was placed into reserve in 1946. &quot;Platypus&quot; was sold for scrap in 1958.

==Construction and acquisition==
&quot;Platypus&quot; was ordered as a submarine tender by the Australian government before the outbreak of the war to service the new E-class submarines, and . She was built by John Brown and Company at Clydebank in Scotland, and launched on 28 October 1916. By the time she was completed, both submarines had been lost, and she was instead commissioned into the Royal Navy on 21 March 1917.

==Operational history==
===Royal Navy===
At the conclusion of the war, the ship was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy and was commissioned into the RAN on 25 March 1919.

===Royal Australian Navy===
&quot;Platypus&quot;″s main role was to support the RAN&#x27;s six J-class submarines, which she sailed with from Britain to Sydney between April and July 1919.

&quot;Platypus&quot; and all six J-class submarines were based at Geelong in February 1920. Due to the poor condition of the submarines and financial pressure on the RAN the Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service was disbanded in May 1922 and &quot;Platypus&quot; was redesignated as a destroyer tender. &quot;Platypus&quot; reverted to her original role as a submarine tender in 1929 when the RAN acquired two O-class submarines but was used as a depot ship after these submarines were placed into reserve in 1930. She was renamed HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot; on 15 August 1930.

In October 1932, a mutiny occurred aboard &quot;Penguin&quot;. The mutiny was in protest of the decreases in sailor pay and conditions: Depression-era cutbacks had impacted them harder than officers, as they had no avenues of protest. The ship&#x27;s commanding officer was sympathetic, promising that he would forward their concerns to the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (which refused to consider them) and that they would not be punished.

She continued as a depot ship until 26 February 1941 when she was renamed HMAS &quot;Platypus&quot; and returned to seagoing service as a training ship. In May 1941, &quot;Platypus&quot; sailed to Darwin to serve as a base ship. She survived the Japanese attack on Darwin in February 1942 and remained at Darwin until January 1943 when she sailed to Cairns, Queensland where she again served as a base ship until May 1944. In June 1944 &quot;Platypus&quot; received a major refit and sailed to New Guinea as a repair and maintenance vessel. She operated off New Guinea and Morotai Island until returning to Australia in December 1945. The wartime service of &quot;Platypus&quot; was later recognised with the battle honour &quot;Darwin 1942–43&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Platypus&quot; was placed into reserve on 13 May 1946, paid off on 1 November 1956 and was sold for scrap on 20 February 1958.

<text>Three ships and two shore installations of the Royal Australian Navy have been named HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot; after the aquatic, flightless bird:

* , a composite sloop originally commissioned by the Royal Navy, before being transferred to the RAN in 1913 as a depot ship
* HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot;, a second-class protected cruiser, , was renamed &quot;Penguin&quot; in 1923 when it was converted to accommodations
* HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot;, a submarine depot ship HMS &quot;Platypus&quot; built for the Royal Navy before being transferred to the RAN as in 1919 and renamed &quot;Penguin&quot; in 1929. The ship was renamed &quot;Platypus&quot; in 1941.
* HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot;, the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s primary naval base on the east coast of Australia, located on Garden Island in Sydney, was known as HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot; until it was renamed in January 1943.
* , one of the RAN&#x27;s major training establishments, is located in Balmoral, New South Wales.

Three other bases were established as subordinate to the Garden Island base. These were also given the name HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot;, but with a Roman numeral suffix added:

* HMAS &quot;Penguin II&quot;, naval base at Balmoral, New South Wales, until renamed in January 1943
* HMAS &quot;Penguin III&quot;, a Naval depot in Newcastle, which was subsequently commissioned as on 1 August 1940

<text>College of St. Joseph was a Private Roman Catholic liberal arts college in Rutland County, Vermont. It occupied a wooded campus. Although the college was accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education, it was placed on probation in August 2018 because of the college&#x27;s financial challenges. It closed at the end of the spring 2019 semester.

== Academics ==
=== Accreditation ===
The college was accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE). It was also approved by the State of Vermont Department of Education and some of its programs were accredited or approved by discipline-specific organizations such as the Council of Applied Master&#x27;s Programs in Psychology and the Board of Psychological Examiners of Vermont. 

In August 2018, NECHE placed the college on probation because the college had experienced significant financial challenges including spending nearly all of its endowment. Four months later, NECHE told the college that it had until April 1, 2019 to convince the accreditor that the college was financially viable; if it was unsuccessful, NECHE would withdraw accreditation and require the college to stop teaching at the end of the 2019 spring semester.

=== Undergraduate programs===
The college offered more than 20 different degree programs in the arts &amp; sciences, business, criminal justice, and psychology &amp; human services. In 2014, the college introduced a social media certificate program and concentration.

=== Graduate programs===
The college offered a number of master&#x27;s degree programs in business, education, and psychology and human services. In January 2018, the Traumatology Institute was established to provide advanced education, training, research and humanitarian aid, and was geared towards emergency responders, medical and mental health professionals, and others who work with trauma victims. CSJTI has received full accreditation from the Green Cross Academy of Traumatology, and becomes the only program in the State of Vermont and surrounding area offering certification for this emerging field of study.

== Campus ==
=== Main Campus ===
The main building was St. Joseph Hall, which houses the President&#x27;s office, External Affairs, Admissions, Financial Aid, the Giorgetti Library, classrooms, faculty offices, computer labs, the Registrar&#x27;s Office, and more. Tuttle Hall housed the student services offices, a student lounge/waiting room, a 200-seat theater, a chapel, and Campus Ministry. The Athletic Center on campus had a 1,000-seat gymnasium, a weight and cardio room, a racquetball court, and a dance studio. There were also two undergraduate dormitories built in 1967, Roncalli Hall and Medaille Hall.

=== West Campus ===
In 2008, the college purchased the Clementwood estate from the Sisters of St. Joseph, consisting of the Clementwood Mansion, Bucci Hall/the Carriage House, Avilia Hall, and St. Francis Hall. Clementwood Mansion, built in 1863 by Charles Clement as a private home and later used by the Sisters of St. Joseph as their novitiate, was remodeled over the course of two years, and in spring 2010, the president&#x27;s office, academic dean&#x27;s office, and development and alumni relations office moved into Clementwood.

== Demographics ==
In fall 2015, the undergraduate population consisted of 53% men and 47% women. Total enrollment was 327 students. 78% were undergraduates and 22% were graduate students. The racial composition was 64% white, 24% black, and 12% Hispanic.

== Athletics ==
CSJ athletic teams were called the Fighting Saints. The college was a member of the Division II ranks of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), primarily competing in the Yankee Small College Conference from 2011–12 to 2018–19. The Fighting Saints competed in the Sunrise Athletic Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2002–03 to 2010–11.

CSJ competed in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, golf and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, soccer, softball, and volleyball; and co-ed sports included eSports.

<text>Aftermath Entertainment is an American record label founded by hip hop producer and rapper Dr. Dre in 1996. It operates as a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, and is distributed through Interscope Records.

The label&#x27;s roster includes artists such as Eminem, Marsha Ambrosius, Anderson .Paak, Ez Mil, and Snoop Dogg, while former artists include 50 Cent and Kendrick Lamar, among others.

== History ==
Upon his departure from Death Row Records on March 22, 1996, Dr. Dre quickly launched Aftermath Entertainment through Death Row&#x27;s former parent label, Interscope Records. It was founded as a &quot;boutique label&quot; that prides itself on &quot;quality over quantity&quot;, focusing on small numbers of high-profile releases.

&quot;Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath&quot; was the label&#x27;s first release. The compilation, featuring artists who were amongst the label&#x27;s first signees, was released on November 26, 1996. A year later, on October 21, 1997, Aftermath released the only collaborative project by hip hop supergroup The Firm, composed of Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ and Nature. Despite the highly anticipated album featuring production and cameo appearances by Dr. Dre himself, debuting atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and being certified platinum, it sold below commercial expectation. The group was subsequently dropped from Aftermath and later disbanded.

Upon recommendation from Interscope co-founder and Dre&#x27;s close friend, Jimmy Iovine, he signed Eminem to Aftermath on March 9, 1998. On February 23, 1999, Eminem&#x27;s major-label debut album, &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; was released. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, went on to be certified quadruple platinum, and arguably became the label&#x27;s first successful album release. Also in 1999, on November 16, after a seven-year hiatus from releasing an album, Aftermath released &quot;2001&quot;, Dr. Dre&#x27;s follow-up to his 1992 album, &quot;The Chronic&quot;. The album went on to be certified sextuple platinum.

Several more artists were signed to, and later dropped from Aftermath, including Hittman, Rakim, King T, Dawn Robinson and Eve, due to production, creative or business conflicts. Following the June 25, 2002 release of her debut album under Aftermath, &quot;Truthfully Speaking&quot;, singer Truth Hurts, Dr. Dre and producer DJ Quik faced a multi-million dollar lawsuit from Lata Mangeshkar over the unauthorized usage of one of her songs as a sample for her hit single, &quot;Addictive&quot;. This caused sales from her debut album to dwindle and Truth Hurts to subsequently cut ties with the label soon after.

In 2002, New York City rapper 50 Cent was signed to Aftermath by Dr. Dre through a joint venture with Eminem&#x27;s Shady Records. His major-label debut album, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;, was released on February 6, 2003, through the three labels. It mainly featured production from Dr. Dre and Eminem, who also executive produced the album. Highly anticipated and anchored by the success of the singles &quot;21 Questions&quot;, &quot;If I Can&#x27;t&quot; and the number one hit, &quot;In da Club&quot;, the album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Selling 872,000 copies in its first week, the album went on to be certified 9× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2020 with &quot;In da Club&quot; going diamond in 2023.

Compton rapper The Game signed with the label in mid-2003 through a joint venture with 50 Cent&#x27;s G-Unit Records, after a negotiation between Dre and Iovine. On January 18, 2005, Aftermath and G-Unit released his debut album, &quot;The Documentary&quot;, to commercial and critical acclaim. It stood upon the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&#x27;s number one position for a total of two weeks and went on to sell two million copies in the United States. Shortly after the release of &quot;The Documentary&quot;, tensions between the Game and 50 Cent ignited, with the latter dropping the former from his G-Unit imprint during an interview on a radio show, which provoked a shooting causing Game&#x27;s friend to sustain a non-fatal bullet wound in his leg. After a truce, Game and 50 continued to clash through interviews and diss tracks, with the former catapulting the catchphrase, &quot;G-Unot&quot;, a parody and boycott of G-Unit. This action resulted in Dr. Dre forcing the Game off of Aftermath in 2006. Game was transferred from Interscope to its subsidiary, Geffen Records, which is also a part of Universal Music&#x27;s Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, to help terminate his contractual obligations with Aftermath and G-Unit.

Busta Rhymes was signed and released one album on June 13, 2006, &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, which would later debut at number one, becoming his first and only album in his career to make the number one slot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2008, after internal conflict with Jimmy Iovine over the delaying of his planned eighth studio album, &quot;Blessed&quot;, Busta Rhymes was released from Interscope, causing him to lose his deal with Aftermath. The album would later be reworked into &quot;Back on My B.S.&quot; which would later be released in the spring of 2009, under Interscope&#x27;s now-defunct sister label, Universal Motown, in conjunction with his own label, Flipmode Entertainment (now Conglomerate).

Stat Quo, a rapper from Atlanta, was released from Aftermath and Eminem&#x27;s Shady Records in 2008 after being a part of the joint deal for five years, citing differences in direction over whether or not to release his debut album, &quot;Statlanta&quot;. The album was later reworked and released independently in the summer of 2010.

Philadelphia rapper Eve, who had returned to the label in 2004, following her previous label, Ruff Ryders Entertainment, ending their distribution deal with Interscope, also ended her relationship with Aftermath for the second time, leaving the label in December 2007. The first time Eve joined Aftermath and was later dropped in 1998 in exchange for the label signing would-be labelmate, Eminem, she claimed to be &quot;devastated&quot;. The second time is over Interscope and Geffen&#x27;s constant delaying of her fourth studio album, &quot;Here I Am&quot;, which was set to be released under Aftermath, Swizz Beatz&#x27;s Full Surface Records and Interscope&#x27;s Geffen. Following a falling out with Interscope co-founder Jimmy Iovine, Eve parted ways with Interscope Geffen A&amp;M in December 2009 and went on a four-year hiatus from music, before returning with her reworked fourth album, now titled &quot;Lip Lock&quot;, released independently in 2013.

In January 2010, it was revealed that Bishop Lamont had left the label, due to the repeated delaying of his debut, &quot;The Reformation&quot;, while singer Marsha Ambrosius had also left the label the same year to sign with the now-defunct J Records.

In March 2012, it was announced that Kendrick Lamar had signed with the label jointly through Top Dawg Entertainment. That October, his album, &quot;Good Kid, M.A.A.D City&quot;, was released. It received commercial and critical acclaim, becoming one of the best hip hop albums of that year and the 2010s overall.

In October 2013, Jon Connor announced his signing to Aftermath during the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. However, in May 2019, he parted ways with the label after the constant delaying of his planned debut album, &quot;Vehicle City&quot;, ending his four-year relationship with Dre. On February 20, 2014, 50 Cent announced his departure from Interscope Records, which included his joint deal with Aftermath and Shady. He later signed to his own imprint, G-Unit Records, in a new distribution deal with Interscope&#x27;s sister label, Capitol Records&#x27; former independent faction, Caroline Records (now Virgin Music).

On March 15, 2015, Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;, was released a week earlier than expected, due to a marketing error on behalf of Interscope. Despite this, the album received widespread acclaim and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Lamar&#x27;s first in his career to do so. On August 7, after fifteen years and nine months of not releasing an official album, Dr. Dre released his latest album, &quot;Compton&quot;, in promotion for the year&#x27;s biopic, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, which chronicled the rise and fall of Dre&#x27;s previous group, N.W.A&quot;.&quot; The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Through the album, Anderson .Paak, one of its core features, was in talks to sign with Aftermath. The deal did not complete until January 2016. However, Anderson was not signed to Interscope through the imprint, instead signing a management deal with Doug Morris&#x27; 12Tone Music. Through these labels, he released two albums, &quot;Oxnard&quot; (2018) and &quot;Ventura&quot; (2019).

In May 2022, Kendrick Lamar announced his final album under Top Dawg, a double album titled &quot;Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers&quot;. It was released under TDE and Aftermath without further input from Dr. Dre nor Top Dawg affiliates. It is unclear whether if this album is also Lamar&#x27;s final album under Aftermath as he recently shifted his focus on his own production label, PGLang.

In 2023, it was announced and later confirmed that after 50 Cent and Stat Quo, Filipino rapper Ez Mil has officially signed to Aftermath and Shady.

In December 2021, Dr. Dre confirmed that he had finished recording &quot;Casablanco&quot;, an album with Marsha Ambrosius, with both artists describing the finished product as some of their “best work”. The album was released in June 2024 to critical acclaim.

In 2024, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre&#x27;s lifetime collaborator since 1992, signed with the label to record his upcoming twentieth studio album &quot;Missionary&quot;, entirely produced by Dr. Dre. The album was released on December 13, 2024, via Dr. Dre&#x27;s then-defunct founded and Snoop Dogg-relived record label Death Row Records. The album is a spiritual sequel to his debut studio album &quot;Doggystyle&quot; (1993), while he was then known as Snoop Doggy Dogg.

<doc id="529698" wikidata="Q4872743" url="?curid=529698" title="Battle of Wireless Ridge">
<text>The Battle of Wireless Ridge was an engagement of the Falklands War which took place on the night from 13 to 14 June 1982, between British and Argentine forces during the advance towards the Argentine-occupied capital of the Falkland Islands, Port Stanley.

Wireless Ridge was one of seven strategic hills within five miles of Stanley at that had to be taken in order for the Island&#x27;s capital to be approached. The attack was successful, and the entire Argentine force on the Islands surrendered later that day.

The British force consisted of 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (2 Para), a troop of the Blues &amp; Royals, with two FV101 Scorpion and two FV107 Scimitar light tanks, as well as artillery support from two batteries of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and naval gunfire support provided by &#x27;s 4.5-in gun.

The Argentine force consisted of the 7th Infantry Regiment as well as detachments from other units. The first Argentine unit to arrive in the sector was the 10th Brigade Headquarters Company commanded by Major José Rodolfo Banetta that took up residence inside the Moody Brook Barracks, but this unit had to evacuate the area on 11 June when British Harriers struck the building, killing three Argentine soldiers (Privates Mario Gustavo Rodríguez, Carlos Gustavo Mosto and Ignacio María Indino) and wounding their company commander. At first, the 7th Regiment on Wireless Ridge was relatively comfortable, shooting sheep and roasting them on old bed frames the soldiers had found nearby. The soldiers of the supporting 10th Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, according to Private Sergio Díaz, also had a fairly comfortable time at first, enjoying a huge barbecue and cans of beers while commemorating Argentine Army Cavalry Day on 23 April. Private Guillermo Vélez from the 7th Regiment&#x27;s Headquarters &amp; Support Company maintains that he personally shot and killed 50 sheep during his time on Wireless Ridge.

==Background==

After heavy losses during the Battle of Goose Green, including their commander, Lieutenant Colonel &#x27;H&#x27; Jones, command of 2 Para passed to Lieutenant-Colonel David Chaundler, who was in England at the time of the battle. Chaundler flew to Ascension Island on a Vickers VC10 and then to the Falklands on a C-130 Hercules that was dropping supplies by parachute. Chaundler jumped into the sea, where he was picked up by helicopter and eventually delivered to for a briefing with Admiral Sandy Woodward and then to Major General Jeremy Moore&#x27;s headquarters.

Four days after Goose Green, Chaundler joined 2 Para. After debriefing the battalion&#x27;s officers about Goose Green and the events following, he vowed that the unit would never again go into action without fire support.

From Fitzroy, 2 Para were moved by helicopter to Bluff Cove Peak where they were held in reserve. The first line of hills: Two Sisters, Mount Longdon and Mount Harriet, were taken. Three other hills were then slated to be captured: Mount Tumbledown by the Scots Guards, Mount William by the Gurkhas and Wireless Ridge by 2 Para. The final phase of 3 Commando Brigade&#x27;s campaign, the battle for Stanley, would follow the capture of these hills.

On the morning of 13 June, it became clear that the attacks on Tumbledown had been successful, so 2 Para marched around the back of Mount Longdon to take up their positions for the assault on Wireless Ridge. As the action was expected to be concluded quickly, they took only their weapons and as much ammunition as possible, leaving most other gear behind in the camp. On Bluff Cove Peak, the Battalion&#x27;s mortars and heavy machine guns were attacked by Argentine A-4 Skyhawks, which delayed their planned move forward, although they suffered no casualties.

==Initial assault==
In the closing hours of 13 June, D Company (Coy) began the attack sequence, advancing upon &#x27;Rough Diamond&#x27; hill north-west of Mount Longdon. It had been hit by an intense barrage from British guns, from land and sea.

In the softening-up bombardment, British artillery had fired 6,000 rounds with their 105 mm pieces, and as the British paratroopers began their push, they were further backed by naval fire and the 76 and 30 mm guns mounted on the light tanks. The approximately 80 casualties sustained by 2 Para two weeks earlier at the Battle of Goose Green (including the loss of their commanding officer), had induced them not to take any unnecessary chances the second time around. The Argentine commanding officer, Lt.Col. Omar Giménez, says that three or four times he was nearly killed by a direct hit during the softening-up bombardment.

When D Coy reached the hill, they found that the Argentine &quot;compañía&quot; C of the 7th Infantry Regiment had withdrawn due to the heavy bombardment. As Major Philip Neame&#x27;s D Coy started to consolidate their position, the Argentine 7th Regiment launched a series of heavy recoilless rifle, rocket and mortar attacks on Mount Longdon, causing casualties to the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (3 Para).

With this massive fire support, A and B Coys were convinced the enemy on the &#x27;Apple Pie&#x27; feature had been defeated, and began to advance confidently, but they met fierce resistance when they left their trenches. They came under heavy machine-gun fire; massive retaliation was initiated by the British machine-gunners and the guns of the Blues and Royals light tanks.

One Mount Longdon survivor from 3 Para recalled the British attack which was initially repulsed by the Argentines:

The Argentine defenders there eventually withdrew in the face of such withering fire, and A and B Coys took their objective. By this stage of the battle, there were not many experienced Argentine officers left; the Forward Artillery Observation Officer (Major Guillermo Nani), the Operations Officer (Captain Carlos Ferreyra) and the &quot;compañía&quot; A and C commanders (Captains Jorge Calvo and Hugo García) and at least three senior platoon commanders (First Lieutenants Antonio Estrada, Jorge Guidobono and Ramon Galíndez-Matienzo) were wounded. C Coy then moved down from their northern start line to advance to a position east of Wireless Ridge where they found a platoon position was unoccupied.

By about 4.30am, Lieutenant-Colonel Gimenez knew that the 7th Infantry Regiment had been decisively defeated; &quot;Communications are lost, my whole regiment is finished&quot;, but other attached units continued to fight.

==SAS diversionary raid==
The Special Air Service, along with men from the Special Boat Squadron, carried out a diversionary raid immediately north of Port Stanley on the night of 13–14 June. The plan was, as 2 PARA attacked the northern half of Wireless Ridge, 30 SAS and SBS commandos aboard 4 Rigid Raiders would speed across the Murrell River entrance and attack the oil storage facilities on Cortley Ridge. However, before it could reach its objective, the assault force was illuminated by a spotlight on the Argentine Almirante Irízar hospital ship (illegally preparing to collect Major José Ricardo Spadaro&#x27;s 601 National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron on Navy Point for a major insertion behind 2 PARA). A massive amount of fire, including 30mm anti-aircraft guns arched down onto the SAS/SBS force from positions along the northern shore, caused the British raiders to withdraw. Three British commandos were wounded and all the Rigid Raiders involved were damaged beyond repair. Thus the raid achieved its aim of convincing the defenders that a major sea-borne landing was about to happen.

==Final assault==
Led by Captain Rodrigo Alejandro Soloaga, two platoons (under Lieutenant Luis Bertolini and Second Lieutenant Diego Bianchi-Harrington) from the Argentine 10th Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (which normally operated the Panhard AML) arrived on foot as reinforcements and took over the abandoned positions of the 7th Regiment Reconnaissance Platoon (under Lieutenant Francisco Ramón Galindez-Matienzo) in the western rocks of Wireless Ridge.

Maj. Philip Neame&#x27;s D Coy (2 Para) then began the final assault from the western end of Wireless Ridge, under the cover of fire from &#x27;s 4.5 inch gun, four light tanks, twelve 105 mm artillery pieces, several mortars and anti-tank rockets.
As the Argentine 7th Infantry absorbed the attack, Soloaga&#x27;s squadron with around 100 men (including 30 hand-picked conscripts and NCOs having received Commando training the year before) were able to engage the British forces on &quot;Apple Pie&quot;, including the tanks, a Milan platoon and a machine gun platoon. Over the course of two hours the 10th Squadron suffered six dead and 50 wounded.

D Coy took the first half of their objective after a hard fight with a platoon of Argentine paratroopers under 2nd Lt Gustavo Alberto Aimar of the 2nd Airborne Infantry Regiment. While Neame&#x27;s company was able to overrun the Argentine paratroopers, wounding Aimar and several of his men, the British suffered two killed (Privates David Parr and Francis Slough) in the process. Neame&#x27;s men then came under fierce attack from Maj. Guillermo Berazay&#x27;s &quot;Compañía A&quot;, 3rd Regiment which had tried to move forward to Mt Longdon during the fighting two nights earlier but had only reached Moody Brook valley. With Lt José Luis Dobroevic&#x27;s 81mm Mortar Platoon providing fire support, the company, in the form of the platoons of &quot;Subteniente&quot; (Sub-Lieutenant) Carlos Javier Aristegui and 2nd Lt Víctor Rodriguez-Pérez advanced to contact. Private Patricio Pérez from Aristegui&#x27;s platoon, recalled the unnerving experience of 66 mm rockets coming straight at them like undulating fireballs. He believed he shot a British paratrooper, possibly 12 Platoon&#x27;s commander, and became enraged when he heard that his friend, Horacio Benítez from his platoon, had been shot.

According to Private Horacio Benítez from Aristegui&#x27;s platoon:

Some 40 soldiers in Rodriguez-Pérez&#x27;s 1st Rifle Platoon and 20 soldiers in Aristegui&#x27;s 3rd Rifle Platoon, after initially going to ground, were rallied and with 2nd Lt Rodriguez-Pérez at the head Delivered a frontal assault and in fact closed in with the British 12 Platoon, under the command of Lt Jonathan Page (following the death of Lt Barry at Goose Green). The fight surged back and forth. Lt Page managed to hold the line, but only just with Major Neame&#x27;s company practically having run out of ammunition seizing and defending their last objective.

Commenting later on the action, retired Major-General John Frost (who in 1944 as a lieutenant-colonel had commanded 2 Para during the Battle of Arnhem) describes the attack on 12 Platoon: &quot;For two very long hours the company remained under pressure. Small-arms fire mingled with all types of HE [high explosive rifle-grenades] fell in and around 12 Platoon&#x27;s position as the men crouched in the abandoned enemy sangars [a type of fortification] and in shell holes.&quot;
According to Neame: &quot;Then from the east we got this counterattack. Jon Page, whose platoon I had left up that end did a really bloody good job. He managed to get hold of our artillery by flicking his radio onto their net, as we were still without our FOO. That broke up their attack.&quot;
Private Graham Carter from D Coy confirms that several men in Aristegui&#x27;s platoon had managed to sneak into the rocks through which 12 Platoon had come earlier: &quot;We were out in the open on limb, and it looked like 10 and 11 Platoons were shooting at us. We asked the OC [Neame] to come over and check our position. He across seeming oblivious to tracer all around him, then wandered back. We thought, &#x27;silly bugger&#x27;. Then our platoon commander [Lt Jonathan Page] stood up, shouted to everyone to keep down and was knocked over himself, hit in the leg. He was screaming and shouting, but when the medic stripped him off there was no wound, just massive bruising where the round had hit his ammunition pouch.&quot;

Neame&#x27;s officers and NCOs rallied the men to capture the final part of their objective and in the face of heavy fire, the Argentines having run out of ammunition, broke and retreated, covered by supporting machine gun fire, directed by Lt Horacio Alejandro Mones-Ruiz, the commander of the 2nd Rifle Platoon from Berazay&#x27;s &quot;compañía&quot;. Privates Esteban Tríes and José Cerezuela of Rodriguez-Pérez&#x27;s platoon, volunteered to stay behind and rescue their wounded platoon sergeant, Manuel Villegas, laboriously carrying him to Port Stanley. With both Argentine rifle platoons having suffered 4 killed and 23 wounded in 2 hours of night combat, Rodriguez-Pérez&#x27;s force had suffered nearly 50% casualties.

Private Michael Savage and other survivors from &quot;Compañía C&quot; were the first 7th Regiment troops to reach the relative safety of Port Stanley, only to be greeted with shock and disdain, he recalls, by immaculately dressed staff officers: &quot;They had been sleeping in houses, in warm beds. They had shiny shoes, pristine ironed uniforms and waxed moustaches. They even had heating in their cars. I was so furious with them.&quot;

The battle was not yet over. Lt-Col. Eugenio Dalton, an Argentine 10th Brigade staff officer, during the pre-dawn darkness of 14 June, was seen driving around in a jeep, marshalling tired, panicky and dazed soldiers from various units into a company and leading them into Stanley&#x27;s western sector, under heavy fire. Some 200 survivors from Wireless Ridge had been rallied by Dalton to form, under heavy gunfire, a last-ditch defensive line in front of the now silenced guns of the 4th Airborne Artillery Group near the racecourse. Near the church in Stanley, intent on helping Berazay, Maj. Carrizo-Salvadores, Second-in-command of the 7th Regiment, helped by the chaplain Father José Fernández, mustered about 50 Wireless Ridge survivors and led them on a bayonet charge, with the soldiers chanting their famous &#x27;Malvinas March&#x27;, but were stopped by heavy artillery and machine-gun fire. The Paras were momentarily alarmed and watched surprised, with Neame describing it as &quot;quite a sporting effort, but one without a sporting chance&quot;. Neame later gave more details: &quot;Then as daylight began we got another counter-attack, this time from the Moody Brook side onto Sean Webster&#x27;s platoon. I thought &#x27;bloody hell, what&#x27;s going on around here?&#x27; I wondered what we had got into and thought that this was most unlike the Argentinians. For a while they were quite persistent.&quot;

2 Para had suffered three dead and 11 wounded. Its mortar platoon also reported four mortarmen with broken ankles after having fired supercharge rounds for extra range, in order to repel the Argentine counterattack force that had attacked from Moody Brook. The Argentines suffered approximately 25 dead and about 125 wounded, about 50 were taken prisoner. In the final stages of the battle, Brigadier-General Jofre had been offered the use of Skyhawks to bomb Wireless Ridge with napalm but declined in the belief that the British response would be commensurate.

== Aftermath ==
Along with other key battles in the latter part of British activity under Operation Corporate, such as the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, the success at Wireless Ridge constituted one of the last major battles of the war before the subsequent surrender of Argentina. In the wake of the battle, British forces witnessed the Argentine soldiers pull back toward Stanley, before continuing to turn firepower onto them as they retreated, with one officer remarking &quot;It was a most pathetic sight, and one which I never wish to see again.&quot;

Not wanting to replicate the heavy losses of Goose Green, the British had focussed a heavy artillery bombardment onto the opposing troops before undertaking the main assault, an action that would strongly affect the morale of the Argentine soldiers. The barrage lowered their will to fight significantly, spreading a sense of hopelessness through the forces as they retreated. A well-trained British battalion would also have been hard-pressed and forced to relinquish the position under the same circumstances, according to one military analyst who studied the battle in great detail.

With the opposing forces in retreat, and the successful capture of several key positions, including Wireless Ridge and Mount Tumbledown, the British obtained permission to advance on Stanley, with 2 Para leading the first troops into the town since Argentinian forces had first occupied the territory at the beginning of the war in April 1982. After its recapture, the Argentine surrender came into effect from 14 June.

For the bravery shown at Wireless Ridge, 2 Para was awarded three Military Crosses, one Military Medal and one Distinguished Conduct Medal. 29 Commando was awarded one Military Cross.

In 2022, retired Lieutenant-Colonels Víctor Hugo Rodríguez-Perez and Philip Neame met for the first time in London and exchanged signed copies of their books, &quot;Penal Company on the Falklands: A Memoir of the Parachute Regiment at War 1982&quot; and &quot;Llevando la Patria al Hombro&quot; (&quot;Carrying the weight of the Fatherland on your shoulders&quot;).

<doc id="529709" wikidata="Q1578378" url="?curid=529709" title="Precisionism">
<text>Precisionism was a modernist art movement that emerged in the United States after World War I. Influenced by Cubism, Purism, and Futurism, Precisionist artists reduced subjects to their essential geometric shapes, eliminated detail, and often used planes of light to create a sense of crisp focus and suggest the sleekness and sheen of machine forms. At the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, Precisionism celebrated the new American landscape of skyscrapers, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called &quot;Cubist-Realism.&quot; The term &quot;Precisionism&quot; was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr although according to Amy Dempsey the term &quot;Precisionism&quot; was coined by Charles Sheeler. Painters working in this style were also known as the &quot;Immaculates&quot;, which was the more commonly used term at the time. The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists.

== An American movement ==
While influenced by European modernist artistic movements like Cubism, Purism, and Futurism, Precisionism focused on the themes of industrialization and modernization in the American landscape, using precise, sharply defined geometrical forms. Precisionist artists embraced their American identity and some were reluctant to acknowledge European artistic influences.

There is a degree of reverence for the industrial age in the movement, but social commentary was not fundamental to the style. Like Pop Art, Precisionism has on occasion been interpreted as a criticism of the de-natured society it portrays, though its artists did not often feel comfortable with this reading of their work. Elsie Driggs&#x27; &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; (1926) illustrates this gap in perception. A painting of black and gray steel-mill smokestacks, thick piping, and crisscrossing wires, with only clouds of smoke to relieve the severity of the image, viewers have been tempted to see this dark painting as a statement of environmental concern. To the contrary, Driggs always claimed that she intended an ironic beauty in the image and referred to it as &quot;my El Greco.&quot; Upon seeing the painting, Charles Daniel dubbed her &quot;one of the new classicists.&quot; More often than not, Precisionism implicitly celebrated man-made dynamism and new technologies. Possible exceptions to this statement are some of the darker, more claustrophobic city paintings of Louis Lozowick and the comic anti-capitalist satires of Preston Dickinson.

Varying degrees of abstraction are found in Precisionist works. &quot;The Figure 5 in Gold&quot; (1928) by Charles Demuth, an homage to William Carlos Williams&#x27; imagist poem about a fire truck is abstract and stylized, while the paintings of Charles Sheeler sometimes verge on a form of photorealism. (In addition to his meticulously detailed paintings like &quot;River Rouge Plant&quot; and &quot;American Landscape&quot;, Sheeler, like his friend Paul Strand, also created sharply focused photographs of factories and public buildings.) Some Precisionist works tended toward a &quot;highly controlled approach to technique and form&quot; as well as an application of &quot;hard-edged style to long-familiar American scenes&quot;.

Precisionist artists often focused on urban imagery: office towers, apartment houses, bridges, tunnels, subway platforms, streets, the skyline and grid of the modern city. Other artists, however, such as Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Charles Demuth, Niles Spencer, Ralston Crawford, Sanford Ross, and Charles Sheeler, applied the same approach to more pastoral settings and painted starkly geometric renderings of barns, cottages, country roads, and farm houses. Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy painted still life compositions in a Precisionist style.

==Precisionists==
American artists whose work has been labeled as reflective of Precisionism include: Anna Held Audette, George Ault, Ralston Crawford, Francis Criss, Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Preston Dickinson, Elsie Driggs, Louis Lozowick, Gerald Murphy, Charles Sheeler, Niles Spencer, Morton Schamberg, Joseph Stella, Charles Rosen, Dale Nichols, Millard Sheets,Edward Hopper, Virginia Berresford, Henry Billings, Peter Blume, Stefan Hirsch, Edmund Lewandowski, John Storrs, Miklos Suba, Sandor Bernath, Herman Trunk, Arnold Wiltz, Clarence Holbrook Carter, Edgar Corbridge and the photographers Paul Strand and Lewis Hine. The movement had no major presence outside the United States, although it did influence Australian art where Jeffrey Smart adopted its principles. Although no manifesto was ever created, some of the artists were friends and frequently exhibited at the same galleries. Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s husband, photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, was a highly regarded mentor for the group and was especially supportive of Paul Strand.

Precisionism had an indirect influence on the later styles known as magic realism, pop art, and photorealism, but it was largely considered a dated &quot;period style&quot; by the 1950s, though its influence on advertising imagery and stage and set design continued throughout the twentieth century. Its two most famous practitioners are Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler.

<doc id="529710" wikidata="Q1411476" url="?curid=529710" title="Kresy">
<text>Eastern Borderlands () or simply Borderlands (, ) was a historical region of the eastern part of the Second Polish Republic. The term was coined during the interwar period (1918–1939). Largely agricultural and extensively multi-ethnic with a Polish minority, it amounted to nearly half of the territory of interwar Poland. Historically situated in the eastern Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, following the 18th-century foreign partitions it was divided between the Empires of Russia and Austria-Hungary, and ceded to Poland in 1921 after the Treaty of Riga. As a result of the post-World War II border changes, all of the territory was ceded to the Soviet Union, and today the area of Kpesy is divided between Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, and south-eastern Lithuania.

The region gave rise to the Kresy myth, a collection of nostalgic views about the area. After the fall of Communism in Europe and dissolution of the Soviet Union a major economic conflict emerged about the real estate lost by Poland with the loss of Kresy.

==Extents==
During the existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, only referred to the borderlands of the Kingdom of Poland and not the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. is also largely co-terminous with the northern areas of the Pale of Settlement, a scheme devised by Catherine II of Russia to limit Jews from settling in the homogenously Christian Orthodox core of the Russian Empire, such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The Pale was established after the Second Partition of Poland and lasted until the Russian Revolution in 1917, when the Russian Empire ceased to exist. In the aftermath of the Polish wars against Ukraine, Lithuania and Soviet Russia, the latter of which was ended by the Treaty of Riga, large parts of the Austrian and Russian partitions became part of Poland. As many as 12 million inhabitants lived in the Eastern Borderlands, but ethnic Poles only were a third of that population, with another third being Ukrainian. Most small towns in the Borderlands were shtetls.

Administratively, the Eastern Borderlands territory was composed of Lwów, Nowogródek, Polesie, Stanisławów, Tarnopol, Wilno, Wołyń, and Białystok voivodeships (provinces). Today, all these regions are divided between Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, and south-eastern Lithuania, with the major cities of Lviv, Vilnius, and Grodno no longer in Poland. During the Second Polish Republic, the Eastern Borderlands denoted the lands beyond the Curzon Line proposed after World War I in December 1919 by the British Foreign Office as the eastern border of the re-emerging sovereign Polish Republic, after over a century of partition. The interwar period in &quot;Kresy&quot; was noted by an active policy of Polonization of the local population, which involved enforced usage of Polish language in education as well as settling of the Polish colonists, Osadniks.

In September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland and follow-up invasion by Soviet Union, in accordance with Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact all Eastern Borderlands territories were incorporated into the Soviet republics of Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, often by means of terror. Soviet territorial annexations during World War II were later ratified by the Allies at the Conferences of Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam and most of Poles here were expelled after the end of World War II in Europe. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was no change to the post-World War II borders. Despite the former provinces of the Eastern Borderlands no longer being part of Poland, a Polish minority remains.

== Etymology ==
The Polish word (&quot;borderlands&quot;) is the plural form of the word meaning &#x27;edge&#x27;. According to , it is &quot;a medieval borrowing from the German word &quot;, which in the Middle Ages meant (&quot;borderline, delineation or circumscribed territory&quot;). Samuel Linde in his &quot;Dictionary of the Polish Language&quot; gives a different etymology of the term. According to him, meant the borderline between Poland and the Crimean Khanate, in the region of the lower Dnieper. The term appeared for the first time in literature in poems, &quot; (1854) and &quot;. Pol claimed that Kresy was the line between the Dniester and Dnieper rivers, neighbouring the Tatar borderland. Coincidentally in relation to Jewish settlement in the macro region, the notion of the &quot;pale&quot; is an archaic English term derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, (which in Polish exists as &quot;pal&quot; and also means a stake), extended in this instance to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the meaning of the term expanded to include the lands of the former eastern provinces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, east of the line. In the Second Polish Republic, equated to historically Polish settled lands to the east of the notional Curzon line. Currently, the term applies to all the eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic that are no longer within the frontiers of modern Poland, together with lands further east, that had been integral to the Commonwealth before 1772, and where Polish communities continue to exist.

== History ==
Polish eastern settlements date back to the dawn of Poland as a state. In 1018, King Bolesław I the Brave invaded Kievan Rus&#x27; (see Bolesław I&#x27;s intervention in the Kievan succession crisis, 1018), capturing Kyiv, and annexing the Cherven Cities. In 1340, Red Ruthenia came under Polish control, which intensified defensive Polish settlement and the introduction of Catholicism. After the Union of Lublin 1569, more Polish settlers moved into the eastern borderlands of the vast Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Most of them came from the Polish provinces of Mazovia and Lesser Poland. They had moved gradually eastwards settling in sparsely populated areas, inhabited by earlier inhabitants such as Lithuanians and Ruthenians. Moreover, the indigenous upper classes of &quot;Kresy&quot; accepted Polish religion, culture and language, resulting in their assimilation and Polonization.

===The Partitions of Poland===
The year 1772 marked the first partition of the Commonwealth of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (see Partitions of Poland). By 1795, the whole eastern half of the state had been annexed by the Russian Empire in concert with the Habsburgs and Prussia&#x27;s Hohenzollerns. The dramatic westward expansion of the Russian Empire through the annexation of Polish-Lithuanian territory substantially increased the new &quot;Russian&quot; Jewish population. Kresy and the superimposed Pale, in the former Polish and Lithuanian territories, had a Jewish population of over five million, and represented the largest community (40%) of the world Jewish population at that time.

From the Polish perspective, the lands came to be called the &quot;Stolen Lands&quot;. Even though Poles were a minority in those areas, owing to forced depopulation, the &quot;Stolen Lands&quot; remained an integral part of Polish national identity, with Polish cultural centres and seats of learning in Vilnius University, Jan Kazimierz University and Krzemieniec Lyceum among many others. Since many local educated inhabitants had actively participated in Polish–Lithuanian national insurgencies (November Uprising, January Uprising), the Russian authorities resorted to intensified persecution, confiscations of property and land, penal deportation to Siberia, and the systematic attempt at Russification of Poles and their traditional culture and institutions.

===The Pale of Settlement===
From the Russian perspective the &quot;Pale of Settlement&quot; included all of Belarus, Lithuania and Moldova, much of present-day Ukraine, parts of eastern Latvia, eastern Poland, and some parts of western Russia, generally corresponding to the macroregion and the modern-day western border of Russia. It extended from the eastern &quot;pale&quot;, or demarcation line, to the Russian border with the Kingdom of Prussia (later the German Empire) and Austria-Hungary. It also comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and largely corresponded to historical lands of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Cossack Hetmanate, and the Ottoman Empire (with Crimean Khanate).

The area included in the Pale, with its large Roman Catholic, Eastern Catholic and Jewish populations, was acquired through a series of military conquests and diplomatic manoeuvres, between 1654 and 1815. While the religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale is clear: conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, the state religion, released individuals from the strictures - historians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and nationalistic in nature.

===Economic decline of Kresy===

The Russian Empire had abandoned Kresy to decline as a vast rural backwater after the original Polish–Lithuanian landowners had been disposed of in the wake of insurrections and the Abolition of serfdom in Poland in 1864. The devastation of country estates put a halt to large scale economic activity which had depended on agriculture, forestry, brewing and small scale industries. Paradoxically, the Southern Kresy (present-day Ukraine) was famous for its fertile soil and was known as the &quot;bread basket of Europe&quot;. Towards the end of the 19th century, the decline was so acute that trade and food supplies became problematic and large scale emigration from towns and villages began as Jewish communities, in particular, began heading West, to Europe and the United States. By the time of a newly resurgent Polish state, the provinces had been additionally disadvantaged by having the lowest literacy levels in the country, since education had not been compulsory during Russian rule. The regions had suffered a legacy of decades of neglect and underinvestment so were generally less economically developed than the western parts of interwar Poland.

=== Between the World Wars ===
The years 1918–1921 were especially turbulent for &#x27;, due to the resurgence of the Polish nation-state and the formation of new borders. At that time, Poland had fought three wars to establish its eastern frontier: with Ukraine, Lithuania and Soviet Russia. In all three conflicts, Poland made territorial conquests, and as a result, it seized territories east of the Curzon line that were previously conquered by Russia, in addition to the land formerly part of the Austrian Galicia. The &#x27; was the most war-devastated area in the whole of interwar Poland. The region later formed the eastern provinces of the Second Polish Republic.

Territories included in the &#x27; during the interbellum period comprised the eastern parts of the Voivodeships of Lwów and Białystok and the whole of the Nowogródek, Polesie, Stanisławów, Tarnopol, Wilno, Wołyń Voivodeships. The Polish government undertook an active policy of Polonizing the &#x27; to alter its ethnic profile in favour of the Poles. One of the ways to do so was through the &quot;Osadnik&quot; colonists. These military colonists were one of the most &quot;emotionalized&quot; parts of the Polish government&#x27;s policy in the &#x27; and elicited opposition from the locals. The German historian said that the &#x27; were &quot;the poorhouse of Poland&quot;, while the Yad Vashem historian Leonid Rein even wrote that &quot;it would not be a great exaggeration to say it was the poor-house of the whole of Europe.&quot; This led to frequent conflicts with Ukrainian nationalists in the southeastern part of &quot;&quot;, which led to the pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia.

Numerous Polish communities continued to live beyond the eastern border of the Second Polish Republic, especially around Minsk, Zhytomyr and Berdychiv. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Soviet authorities created two Polish National Districts in Belarus and Ukraine, but during the &quot;Polish Operation&quot; of the NKVD, most of the Poles in those areas were murdered, while those remaining were forcibly resettled in Kazakhstan (see also Poles in the Soviet Union).

=== During and after World War II ===

As a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, on 17 September 1939, the Kresy territories were annexed by the Soviet Union (see Soviet invasion of Poland), and a significant part of the ethnic Polish population of &quot;Kresy&quot; was deported to other areas of the Soviet Union including Siberia and Kazakhstan. The new border between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was re-designated by the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, signed on 29 September 1939. After the elections to the People&#x27;s Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, communist governments for Western Ukraine and Western Belarus were formed and immediately announced their intention of joining their respective republics to the Soviet Union (see also Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union). After the German invasion of the USSR, the southeastern part of &quot;Kresy&quot; was absorbed into Greater Germany&#x27;s General Government, whereas the rest was integrated with the Reichskommissariats Ostland and Ukraine. In 1943–1944, units of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, with the help of Ukrainian peasants, carried out mass exterminations of Poles living in southeastern &quot;&quot; (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia).

In January 1944, Soviet troops had reached the former Polish–Soviet border, and by the end of July 1944, they again re-annexed the whole territory that had been taken by the USSR in September 1939 into their control. During the Tehran Conference in 1943, a new Soviet-Polish border was established, in effect sanctioning most of the Soviet territorial acquisitions of September 1939 (except for some areas around Białystok and Przemyśl), ignoring protests from the Polish government-in-exile in London. The Potsdam Conference, via substantive recognition of the pro-Soviet Polish Committee of National Liberation, implicitly consented to the deportation of Polish people from &#x27; (see Polish population transfers (1944–1946)). Most Polish inhabitants of &quot;Kresy&quot; were ordered by the Soviets to migrate west to Germany&#x27;s former eastern provinces, newly emptied of their German population and renamed as the &quot;Recovered Territories&quot; of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, based on Polish medieval settlement of the areas. Poles from the southern &#x27; (now Ukraine) were forced to settle mainly in Silesia, while those from the north (Belarus and Lithuania) moved to Pomerania and Masuria. Polish residents of Lwów settled not only in Wrocław, but also in Gliwice and in Bytom. Those cities had not been destroyed during the war. They were relatively closer to the new eastern border of Poland, which could become significant in case of a sudden hoped for a return to the East.

Frequently, whole &quot;Kresy&quot; villages and towns were deported in a single rail transport to new locations in the west. For instance, the village of Biała, near Chojnów, is still divided into two parts: Lower Biała and Upper Biała. Lower Biała was settled by people who used to live in a Bieszczady village of Polana near Ustrzyki Dolne (this area belonged to the Soviet Union until 1951: see 1951 Polish–Soviet territorial exchange), while inhabitants of the village Pyszkowce near Buczacz moved to Upper Biała. Every year in September, Biała is the scene of an annual festival called &quot;Kresowiana&quot;. In Szczecin and Polish West Pomerania, in the immediate postwar period, one-third of Polish settlers were either people from &quot;Kresy&quot; or Sybiraks. In 1948, people born in the Eastern Borderlands made up 47.5% of the population of Opole, 44.7% of Baborów, 47.5% of Wołczyn, 42.1% of Głubczyce, 40.1% of Lewin Brzeski, and 32.6% of Brzeg. In 2011, people with &quot;Kresy&quot; background made up 25% of the population of the Opole Voivodeship. The town of Jasień was settled by people from the area of Ternopil in late 1945 and early 1946, while Poles from Borschiv moved to Trzcińsko-Zdrój and Chojna. The situation was completely different in Wschowa and its county. In 1945–1948, more than 8,000 people moved there. They came from different areas of the &quot;&quot; — Ashmyany, Stanislawow, Równe, Lwów, Brody, Dzyatlava District, and Ternopil.

Altogether, between 1944 and 1946, more than a million Poles from the &#x27; were moved to the Recovered Territories, including 150,000 from the area of Wilno, 226,300 from Polesia, 133,900 from Volhynia, 5,000 from Northern Bukovina, and 618,200 from Eastern Galicia. The so-called First Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946) was carried out in a chaotic, disorganized way. People had to spend weeks, even months at railroad stations, waiting for transport. During that time, they were robbed of their belongings by either locals, Soviet soldiers or Soviet rail workers. For lack of railroad cars, in Lithuania at some point the &quot;one-suitcase policy&quot; was introduced, which meant that Poles had to leave behind all their belongings. They travelled in freight or open wagons, and the journeys were long and dangerous, as there was no protection from the military or the police. In the years 1955–1959, the second mass repatriation of Poles from &#x27; took place. As a result, in the years 1945–1960, over 2 million Polish people left &#x27;. About more remained in the &#x27; after 1960 (especially in the territories of the Lithuanian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR). Even today, Poles constitute the majority of inhabitants in many regions in the Grodno and Vilnius regions. Poles appear in the most recent national censuses as follows - Lithuania 183,000 (2021) ; Belarus 288,000 (2019) ; Ukraine 144,000 (2001) - the Belarus and Ukraine numbers firmly disputed in Poland.

In the immediate postwar period, Polish Communists, who ceded the Eastern Borderlands to the Soviet Union, were universally regarded as traitors, and Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party, was fully aware of it. People who moved from the East to the Recovered Territories talked amongst themselves about their return to Lwów and other eastern locations, and the German return to Silesia, as a result of World War III, in which Western Allies would defeat the Soviets. One of the adages of the postwar period was: &quot;Just one atom bomb, and we will be back in Lwów again.
Just second one is small but strong and we will be back in Wilno again.&quot; (&quot;Jedna bomba atomowa i wrócimy znów do Lwowa. Druga mała, ale silna i wrócimy znów do Wilna&quot;). Polish settlers in former German areas were insecure about their future there until the 1970s (see &quot;Kniefall von Warschau&quot;). Eastern settlers did not feel at home in Lower Silesia, and as a result, they did not care about the machinery, households and farms abandoned by Germans. Lubomierz in 1945 was in good condition, but in the following years, Polish settlers from the area of Chortkiv in Podolia let it run down and become a ruin. The Germans were aware of it. In 1959, German sources wrote that Lower Silesia had been ruined by the Poles. Zdzisław Mach, a sociologist from the Jagiellonian University, explains that when Poles were forced to resettle in the West, which they resented, they had to leave the land they considered sacred and move to areas inhabited by the enemy. In addition, Communist authorities did not initially invest in the Recovered Territories because, like the settlers, for a long time they were unsure about the future of these lands. As Mach says, people in Western Poland for years lived &quot;on their suitcases&quot;, with all their belongings packed in case of return to the East.

== Interwar population ==
The population of &quot;&quot; was multi-ethnic, primarily comprising Poles, Ukrainians, Jews and Belarusians. According to official Polish statistics from the interwar period, Poles formed the largest linguistic group in these regions, and were demographically the largest ethnic group in the cities. Other national minorities included Lithuanians and Karaites (in the north), Jews (scattered in cities and towns across the area), Czechs and Germans (in Volhynia and East Galicia), Armenians and Hungarians (in Lviv) and also Russians and Tatars.

The proportions of different native languages in each voivodeship in 1931, according to the Polish census of 1931, were as follows:

* Wilno Voivodeship; 60% Polish, 23% Belarusian, 8% Yiddish, 3% Russian, 8% Other (including Lithuanian)
* Nowogródek Voivodeship; 53% Polish, 39% Belarusian, 7% Yiddish, 1% Russian
* Polesie Voivodeship; 63% &quot;Other&quot; or Tutejszy (Polesian and other dialects), 14% Polish, 10% Yiddish, 6% Belarusian, 5% Ukrainian
* Wołyń Voivodeship; 68% Ukrainian, 17% Polish, 10% Yiddish, 2% German, 1% Russian, 2% Other
* Lwów Voivodeship; 58% Polish, 34% Ukrainian, 8% Yiddish
* Tarnopol Voivodeship; 50% Polish, 45% Ukrainian, 5% Yiddish
* Stanisławów Voivodeship; 69% Ukrainian, 23% Polish, 7% Yiddish, 1% German

In addition to ethnic Poles in former eastern Poland, there were also large Polish communities in the USSR and in the Baltic states. Polish population east of the Curzon Line before World War II can be estimated by adding together figures for Former Eastern Poland and for pre-1939 Soviet Union:

Two tables below show the linguistic (mother tongue) and religious structure of interwar South-Eastern Poland (nowadays part of Western Ukraine) and interwar North-Eastern Poland (nowadays part of Western Belarus and southern Lithuania) by county, according to the 1931 census.

===Largest cities and towns===

In 1931, according to the Polish National Census, the ten largest cities in Polish Eastern Borderlands were: Lwów (pop. 312,200), Wilno (pop. 195,100), Stanisławów (pop. 60,000), Grodno (pop. 49,700), Brześć nad Bugiem (pop. 48,400), Borysław (pop. 41,500), Równe (pop. 40,600), Tarnopol (pop. 35,600), Łuck (pop. 35,600) and Kołomyja (pop. 33,800).

In addition, Daugavpils (pop. 43,200 in 1930) in inter-war Latvia was also a major Polish community with 21% ethnic Polish inhabitants.

== Polish minority after World War II ==
Despite the expulsion of most of ethnic Poles from the Soviet Union between 1944 and 1958, the Soviet census of 1959 still counted around 1.5 million ethnic Poles remaining in the USSR:

According to a more recent census, there were about 295,000 Poles in Belarus in 2009 (3.1% of the Belarus population).

== Notable people ==

A number of influential figures in Polish history were born in the area of &quot;kresy&quot; (note: the redirected list does not include Poles born in the cities of Lwów (Lviv), and Wilno (Vilnius) - see List of Leopolitans, List of people from Vilnius). The family of former President of Poland, Bronisław Komorowski, allegedly hails from northern Lithuania. The mother of Bogdan Zdrojewski, Minister of Culture and National Heritage is from Boryslav, and the father of former First Lady Jolanta Kwaśniewska was born in Wołyń, where his sister was murdered in 1943 by the Ukrainian nationalists.

== Cradle of Polish culture ==

Since some of the most distinguished names of Polish literature and music were born in &#x27;, e.g. Mikołaj Rej, Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki, Karol Szymanowski or Czesław Miłosz, &quot;Eastern Borderlands&quot; have featured repeatedly in the Polish Literary canon. Mickiewicz&#x27;s Pan Tadeusz begins with the Polish language invocation, &quot;O Lithuania, my fatherland, thou art like good health...&quot; Other notable works located in &#x27;, are Nad Niemnem, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass, With Fire and Sword, Fire in the Steppe. In Communist Poland, all &#x27;-related topics, such as Poland&#x27;s eastern centuries old heritage, including ecclesiastical architecture, country houses and stately homes down to the Massacres of Poles in Wołyń were banned from publication for Soviet propaganda reasons, because these lands now belonged to the Soviet Union. In official documents, people born in the Eastern Borderlands were declared as born in the Soviet Union, and very few &#x27;-themed books or films were passed by the state censor at that time. One of the exceptions was the immensely popular comedy trilogy by Sylwester Chęciński (&quot;Sami swoi&quot; from 1967, &quot;Nie ma mocnych&quot; from 1974, and &quot;Kochaj albo rzuć&quot; from 1977). The trilogy tells the story of two quarreling families, who after the end of the Second World War were resettled from current Western Ukraine to Lower Silesia, after Poland was shifted westwards.

After the collapse of the Communist system, the old &quot;&quot; returned as a Polish cultural theme in the form of historical polemics. Numerous books and albums were published about the Eastern Borderlands, frequently with original photos from the prewar era. Examples of such publications include:

* Roman Aftanazy. &quot;Dzieje rezydencji na dawnych kresach Rzeczypospolitej&quot;. Wrocław: Wydawnictwo Ossolineum, 1991–1997. &quot;History of Residences in Poland&#x27;s Former Eastern Borderlands&quot;, (1991–1997), listing and describing in a monumental eleven volume work the cultural heritage contained in the myriad estates and grand residences in the once Polish Kresy and Inflanty regions.
* &quot;Kresy in Photos of Henryk Poddębski&quot;, published in May 2010 in Lublin, with a foreword by people with a &quot;&quot; background - Anna Seniuk, Krzesimir Dębski and Maciej Płażyński 
* &quot;The World of Kresy&quot;, with numerous photos, postcards and maps 
* &quot;Sentimental Journeys. Travel across Kresy with Andrzej Wajda and Daniel Olbrychski&quot;
* &quot;The Encyclopedia of Kresy&quot;, with 3600 articles, and foreword by another famous person from &quot;&quot;, Stanisław Lem. Articles about the Eastern Borderlands frequently appear in Polish newspapers and magazines. The local office of &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; in Wrocław in late 2010 began a &quot;Kresy Family Album&quot;, stories and photos of those who were forced to move from the East.

In the first half of 2011, &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; daily published a series called &quot;The Book of Eastern Borderlands&quot; (&quot;Księga kresów wschodnich&quot;). The July 2012 issue of the Uważam Rze Historia magazine was dedicated to the Eastern Borderlands and their importance in Polish history and culture.

== Present day ==

The territory known to Poles as &quot;&quot; is now partitioned off between the states of Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania. Ethnic Poles still live in those areas: in Lithuania, they are the largest ethnic minority in the country (see Poles in Lithuania), in Belarus, they are the second largest ethnic minority in the country after Russians (see Poles in Belarus), and in Ukraine, they officially number 144,130, but some Polish organizations claim that the number of Poles in Ukraine may be as many as 2 million, most of them assimilated. (see Poles in Ukraine). Furthermore, there is a 50,000 Polish minority in Latvia. In Lithuania and Belarus, Poles are more numerous than in Ukraine. This is the result of the Polish population transfers (1944–1946) as well as Massacres of Poles in Volhynia. Those Poles who survived the slaughter begged for the opportunity to emigrate.

Many Polish organizations are active in the former Eastern Borderlands, such as the Association of Poles in Ukraine, Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land, the Federation of Polish Organizations in Ukraine, Union of Poles in Belarus, and the Association of Poles in Lithuania. There are Polish sports clubs (Pogoń Lwów, FK Polonia Vilnius), newspapers (Gazeta Lwowska, Kurier Wileński), radio stations (in Lviv and Vilnius), many theatres, schools, choirs and folk ensembles. Poles living in &quot;Kresy&quot; are helped by a government-sponsored organization Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie, and by other organizations, such as the Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy (see also Karta Polaka). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in &quot;Kresy&quot;, and there are several annual events, such as &quot;Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy&quot;, and &quot;Summer with Poland&quot;, sponsored by Association &quot;Polish Community&quot;, in which Polish children from &quot;Kresy&quot; are invited to visit Poland. Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to &quot;Kresy&quot;. Books are most often sent to Polish schools which exist there — for example, in December 2010, University of Wrocław organized an event called &quot;Become a Polish Santa Claus and Give a Book to a Polish Child in Kresy&quot;. Polish churches and cemeteries (such as Cemetery of the Defenders of Lwów) are renovated with money from Poland. For example, in Nysa, money is collected to renovate the Roman Catholic church in Łopatyn near Lviv, while residents of Oława collect funds to renovate the church in Sasiv, also in the area of Lviv. Also, physicians from Kraków&#x27;s organization Doctors of Hope regularly visit Eastern Borderlands, and the Polish Ministry of Education runs a special program, which sends Polish teachers to the former Soviet Union. In 2007, more than 700 teachers worked in the East, most of them in &quot;Kresy&quot;. Studio East of Polish TV Wrocław organizes an event called &quot;Save your grandfather&#x27;s tomb from oblivion&quot; (&quot;Mogiłę pradziada ocal od zapomnienia&quot;), during which students from Lower Silesia visit Western Ukraine, to clean Polish cemeteries there. In July 2011, about 150 students cleaned 16 cemeteries in the areas of Lviv, Ternopil, Podolia and Pokuttya.

Despite wars and ethnic cleansing many treasures of Polish culture still remain in the East. In Vilnius, there is the Wróblewski Library, with 160,000 volumes and 30,000 manuscripts, which now belong to the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. In Lviv, there is the Ossolineum, one of the most important Polish culture centres. Adolf Juzwenko, current president of Wrocław&#x27;s office of the Ossolineum, says that in 1945, there was a mass public campaign in Poland, aimed at transporting the whole Ossolineum to Wrocław. It succeeded in recovering only 200,000 volumes, as the Soviets decided that the bulk of the library had to remain in Lviv.

=== In contemporary Poland ===

Even though Poland lost its Eastern Borderlands in the aftermath of World War II, Poles connected with the Kresy still have some affection for those lands. Since Poles from current Western Ukraine mostly moved to Silesia. The cities of Wrocław and Gliwice are regarded as &quot;miasta lwowskie&quot; (cities of Lwów affinity), while Szczecin, Gdańsk and Olsztyn are regarded as &quot;miasta wileńskie&quot; (cities of Wilno affinity). Lwów&#x27;s Ossolineum Foundation, its collections and famous library are now located in Wrocław. Polish academics from Lwów established the Polish University of Wrocław (taking over from the old German University of Breslau) and Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice. At the same time, Polish academics from Vilnius founded Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń (even though Toruń belonged to Poland before the outbreak of World War II before 1939).

There are numerous Kresy-oriented organizations, with the largest one, World Congress of Kresy Inhabitants (&quot;Światowy Kongres Kresowian&quot;), located in Bytom, and branches scattered across Poland, and abroad. The Congress organizes annual World Convention and Pilgrimage of Kresy Inhabitants to Jasna Góra Monastery.

Other important &quot;Kresy&quot; organizations, active in contemporary Poland, include:
* &quot;Polskie Towarzystwo Miłośników Miasta Krzemieńca i Ziemi Krzemienieckiej&quot; (Polish Association of Lovers of Krzemieniec and Krzemieniec Land) from Poznań.
* &quot;Stowarzyszenie Kresowe &quot;Podkamień&quot;&quot; (Kresy Association &quot;Podkamien&quot;) from Wołów,

Every year, in the Masurian town of Mrągowo, there is a &quot;Festiwal Kultury Kresowej&quot; (Festival of Kresy Culture), sponsored among others by the Senate of the Republic of Poland and the Minister of Culture, with the patronage of the First Lady. The Festival is broadcast by TVP2 and TVP Polonia, and in 2011 it was organized for the 17th time. Among participants of the 2011 Festival, there were such artists, as Folk Ensemble Mozyrzanka from Mozyr, Children and Youth Band Tęcza from Minsk, Folk Band Kresowianka from Ivyanets, Polish Academic Choir Zgoda from Brest, Instrumental Band Biedronki from Minsk, Vocal Duo Wspólna wędrówka from Minsk, Children&#x27;s Polonia Ensemble Dolinianka from Stara Huta (Ukraine), Ensemble Fujareczka from Sambir, Ensemble Boryslawiacy from Boryslav, Ensemble Niebo do Wynajecia from Stralhivci (Ukraine), Polish Dance and Song Ensemble Wilenka from Vilnius, Dance and Song Band Troczenie from Trakai, Band Wesołe Wilno from Vilnius, Song and Dance Ensemble Kotwica from Kaunas, and Folk and Polish Folklore Dance and Song Ensemble Syberyjski Krakowiak from Abakan in Siberia.

In Lubaczów is a Museum of Kresy, and there is a project, supported by local government, to create a Museum of Eastern Borderlands in Wrocław, the city where a number of Poles from Kresy settled after World War II. Numerous photo albums and books, depicting cities, towns and landscapes of &quot;Kresy&quot; are published every year in Poland. In Chełm, there is Kresy Bicycle Marathon, Polish Radio Białystok every week broadcasts &quot;Kresy Magazine&quot;, dedicated to the history and present times of the Eastern Borderlands. Every Sunday, Polish Radio Katowice broadcasts a program based on famous prewar Lwów&#x27;s Merry Wave, every Tuesday, Polish Radio Rzeszów broadcasts a program &quot;Kresy Landscapes&quot;. In Wrocław, the Association of Remembrance of Victims of Ukrainian Nationalists publishes &quot;Na Rubieży&quot; (&quot;On the Border&quot;) magazine. Among best known &quot;Kresy&quot; activists of contemporary Poland are Father Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski, and Dr. Tadeusz Kukiz, father of popular singer Paweł Kukiz. Since 2007, annual medals Heritage of Eastern Borderlands are awarded in Wrocław. The 2011 recipient was emeritus Archbishop of Wrocław, Henryk Gulbinowicz. Participants of annual Katyń Motorcycle Raid (&quot;Motocyklowy Rajd Katyński&quot;) always visit Polish centers in &quot;Kresy&quot;, giving presents to children, and meeting local Poles.

The program of 2011 Days of Kresy Culture (October 22–23) in Brzeg covered such events, as: &quot;Kresy&quot; themed cabaret, promotion of &quot;Kresy&quot; books, Eastern Borderlands cuisine, mass in a local church, meetings with &quot;Kresy&quot; activists and scholars, and theatre shows of Brzeg&#x27;s Garrison Club as well as Lwów Eaglets Middle School number 3 in Brzeg. Organizers of the festival assured that for the two days Brzeg would turn into the &quot;capital of interwar Polish Kresy&quot;.

In January, February and March 2012, Centre for Public Opinion Research did a survey, asking Poles about their ties to Kresy. It turned out that almost 15% of the population of Poland (4,3 - 4,6 million people) declared that they either were born in the Kresy, or have a parent or a grandparent from that region. The number of &quot;Kresowiacy&quot; is high in northern and western Poland – as many as 51% of inhabitants of Lubusz Voivodeship, and 47% of inhabitants of Lower Silesian Voivodeship stated that their family has ties to the Kresy. Furthermore, &quot;Kresowiacy&quot; now make 30% of the population of Opole Voivodeship, 25% of the population of West Pomeranian Voivodeship, and 18% of the population of Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship.

==Polish regional dialects==
Since Poles have lived in Kresy for hundreds of years, two groups of Kresy Polish dialects emerged: the northern (&quot;dialekt północnokresowy&quot;), and the southern (&quot;dialekt południowokresowy&quot;). Both dialects have been influenced either by Ukrainian, Belarusian or by Lithuanian. To Polish speakers in Poland, Kresy dialects are easy to distinguish, as their pronunciation and intonation are markedly different from standard Polish. Before World War II, the Kresy provinces were part of Poland, and both dialects were in common usage, spoken by millions of ethnic Poles. After the war and Soviet annexation of Kresy, however, the majority of ethnic Poles were deported westward, resulting in a severe decline in the number of native speakers. The northern Kresy dialect is still used along the Lithuanian-Belarusian border, where Poles still live in large numbers, but the southern Kresy dialect is endangered, as Poles in western Ukraine do not form a majority of the population in any district. Particularly notable among the Kresy dialects is the Lwów dialect which emerged early in the 19th century and was spoken in the city gaining much recognition in the 1920s and 1930s, partly due to the countrywide popularity of numerous Kresy-born and trained actors and comedians whose native speech it was (see also: Dialects of the Polish language).

<doc id="529715" wikidata="Q5630888" url="?curid=529715" title="HMCS Protector">
<text>Royal Canadian Navy base HMCS &quot;Protector&quot;, also known as the Point Edward Naval Base, was located next to Sydney Harbour, on Nova Scotia&#x27;s Cape Breton Island. It was founded in 1940 and used by the navy during the Second World War, mainly to provision, protect and repair merchant marine convoys to Quebec, Halifax, and the United Kingdom. It was a main combat zone during the Battle of the St. Lawrence and the more general Battle of the Atlantic. It continued to be used during the Cold War&#x27;s early stages. In 1964, it was decommissioned and became the first facility to house the Canadian Coast Guard College. Today, the Sydport Industrial Park uses the base&#x27;s former piers and land.

==Second World War 1939–1945==
In the months before the Second World War was declared in 1939, the RCMP Patrol Vessel &quot;Protector&quot; was stationed at Sydney for various policing duties. On 28 August 1939 the Royal Canadian Navy established a small shore facility on the Sydney waterfront. On 22 July 1940, this facility was commissioned as HMCS &quot;Protector&quot;, taking its name from Patrol Vessel &quot;Protector&quot;. At the time, navy regulations stated that a naval shore base&#x27;s designation must use a seaborne ship&#x27;s name.

HMCS &quot;Protector&quot; saw intensive use during the war, as Sydney Harbour became the assembly port for the SC (Slow Convoy) series Atlantic convoys, as well as convoys to other major ports in Canada: Halifax (SH) and Quebec (SQ). Other convoys that were marshaled by &quot;Protector&quot; were Sydney-Corner Brook (SB), Sydney-Port aux Basque (SPAB) and Sydney-Greenland (SG). It was the base for the warships that escorted the SC convoys in the western Atlantic. &quot;Protector&quot; was the focal point for the extensive Sydney Harbour defences against German U-boat attack.

HMCS &quot;Protector&quot; was initially stationed on the Sydney waterfront and used commercial wharves and buildings along Esplanade Street, where the present armouries and marine terminal are located. On 15 March 1943, a new custom-built shore facility and extensive piers was opened at Point Edward on the opposite western shore of the harbour, and was named HMCS &quot;Protector II, while the original was then renamed HMCS &quot;Protector I. A Canadian National Railways line linked this new base to the mainline to Point Tupper. Numerous convoy supply ships and warships were loaded and serviced at &quot;Protector&quot; by ship chandlers such as Sydney Ship Supply; at the same time, the navy maintained use of the commercial facilities on the eastern shore in Sydney proper. The base specialised in repair and fitting.

==Post-war era: 1945 to the present==

After the war&#x27;s end, the navy stopped using the commercial facilities on the Sydney waterfront (eastern side of the harbour). It continued to use HMCS &quot;Protector&quot; at Point Edward, on the western side of the harbour. During the 1950s, the base was renovated and it became Sydney&#x27;s second largest employer, after the Dominion Steel and Coal Company&#x27;s steel plant, with about 650 personnel stationed there. The Progressive Conservative Diefenbaker government tried to close it in 1958, but it was deemed useful by NATO allies during the early stages of the Cold War. It was finally decommissioned in 1964. In 1965, following the base&#x27;s closure, the Canadian Coast Guard College was located in some of the unused navy facilities, and used the base&#x27;s jetties. The college continued to use these facilities throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, until a custom-built campus opened on an adjacent property in Edwardsville in 1981. 

The former navy base is now used as an industrial park called Sydport.

<text>Goddard College was a private college with three locations in the United States: Plainfield, Vermont; Port Townsend, Washington; and Seattle. The college offered undergraduate and graduate degree programs. With predecessor institutions dating to 1863, Goddard College was founded in 1938 as an experimental and non-traditional educational institution based on the idea that experience and education are intricately linked.

For many years, Goddard College provided a mix of residential, low-residency, and distance-learning programs. Its intensive low-residency model was first developed for its MFA in Creative Writing Program in 1963.

In April 2024, Goddard announced that the college would close at the end of the spring semester, due to financial issues and a decline in enrollment. The college was accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==History==
Goddard College began in 1863 in Barre, Vermont, northeast of Middlebury as the Green Mountain Central Institute. In 1870, it was renamed Goddard Seminary in honor of (1811–1868) and his wife Mary (1816–1889). Goddard was a prominent merchant in Boston, and was one of the school&#x27;s earliest and most generous benefactors.

Founded by Universalists, Goddard Seminary was originally a four-year preparatory high school, primarily affiliated with Tufts College in eastern Massachusetts. For many years the seminary prospered. Many public high schools opening in the 20th century made many of the private New England academies obsolete. Attempting to save it, the trustees added a Junior College to the seminary in 1935, with a seminary graduate, Royce S. &quot;Tim&quot; Pitkin, as president.
In 1936, under his leadership, the seminary concluded that for Goddard to survive, an entirely new institution would need to be created. Many educators and laymen agreed with him. Pitkin was supported by Stanley C. Wilson, former governor of Vermont and chairman of the Goddard Seminary Board of Trustees; Senators George Aiken and Ralph Flanders; and Dorothy Canfield Fisher. Pitkin persuaded the board of trustees to embrace a new style of education, one substituting individual attention, democracy, and informality for the traditionally austere and autocratic educational model. On March 13, 1938, Goddard College was chartered. In July 1938 the newly formed Goddard College moved to Greatwood Farm in Plainfield, Vermont.

The new Goddard was an experimental and progressive college. For its first 21 years of operation, Goddard was unaccredited and small, but it built a reputation as one of the most innovative colleges in the country. Especially noteworthy was Goddard&#x27;s use of discussion as the basic method in classroom teaching; its emphasis on the whole lives of students in determining personal curricula; its incorporation of practical work into the life of every student; and its development of the college as a self-governing learning community in which everyone had a voice.

In 1959 Goddard College was accredited. One of the founding principles of Goddard was to provide educational opportunities for adults. There was a great need for a program for adults who had not completed college, to obtain degrees without disrupting their family lives or careers. The Adult Degree Program (ADP), created by Evalyn Bates, was established in 1963. It was the first low-residency adult education program in the country. Over the years many experimental programs were designed at Goddard. The programs included the Goddard Experimental Program for Further Education, Design Build Program, Goddard Cambridge Program for Social Change, Third World Studies Program, Institute for Social Ecology, Single Parent Program and many others.

Based on its use of narrative transcripts instead of traditional letter grades, as well as learner-designed curricula, Goddard was among the founding members of the Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities. In 2002, after 54 years, the college terminated its residential undergraduate degree program and became an exclusively low-residency college. In 2005, the college expanded to the West Coast and established a residency site in Port Townsend, Washington. In July 2011 Goddard began to offer their non-licensure education program in Seattle.

Goddard was placed on probation in 2018 by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE) because of a perceived &quot;[lack of] stability of executive leadership&quot; and concerns about the college&#x27;s financial resources. The probation was lifted in 2020 after the college satisfied the commission that it had rectified those issues. In January 2024, Goddard announced that it would temporarily end its low-residency programs in favor of online learning.

Goddard College closed at the end of the spring semester in 2024, due to a precipitious decline in enrollment from 1,900 in the 1970s to less than 250 in 2024. The main campus in Plainfield, was put up for sale and in late May was announced to be under contract at a price of $3.4 million to an undisclosed buyer. A group of alumni and townspeople organized to attempt to block the sale. In early July 2024 the school announced it was for sale again, with no explanation of what had happened with the previous deal. On August 2, 2024, the college announced plans to sell the campus to a local group, the Greatwood Project, formed by college alumni and former faculty.

==Campuses==
===Main campus, Greatwood: Plainfield, Vermont===
The campus in Plainfield was founded in 1938 on the grounds of a late 19th-century model farm: The Greatwood Farm &amp; Estate consisted of shingle-style buildings and gardens designed by Arthur Shurcliff. The Village of Learning, consisted of eleven dormitory buildings, was built adjacent to the ensemble of renovated farm buildings in 1963 to accommodate an increasing student population. The Pratt Center &amp; Library, designed to be at the heart of a larger campus, was constructed in 1968. No other significant new construction were added after 1968.

On March 7, 1996, the Greatwood campus was recognized for its historic and architectural significance by its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Fort Worden State Park, Port Townsend, Washington campus===
A U.S. Army post from 1902 to 1953, much of the fort was renovated and adapted as a year-round, multi-use facility dedicated to lifelong learning. It housed several organizations which comprise Fort Worden State Park. The fort was on a bluff overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Admiralty Inlet near Port Townsend, Washington.

===Columbia City, Seattle campus===

The MA in Education program, originally held in the Plainfield-based low-residency program, expanded in 2011 into Columbia City, a neighborhood in southeastern Seattle.

The program trained students in bilingual preschool education. Students focused on areas such as intercultural studies, dual language, early childhood, cultural arts, and community education, and created their plan of studies for each semester. The program was designed to serve students who could not leave their families and communities for the residency.

==Academics==
Each Goddard student designed their own curriculum in accordance with their program&#x27;s degree criteria. In addition to fulfilling academic criteria in the subjects of the arts, the humanities, mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences, undergraduate students needed to demonstrate critical thinking and writing, understanding of social and ecological contexts, positive self-development, and thoughtful action within their learning processes.

The college used a student self-directed, mentored system in which faculty issue narrative evaluations of student&#x27;s progress instead of grades. The intensive low-residency model required that students come to campus every six months for approximately eight days. During this period, students engaged in a variety of activities and lectures from early morning until late in the evening, and created detailed study plans. During the semester, students studied independently, sending in &quot;packets&quot; to their faculty mentors every few weeks.

When low-residency education began at Goddard, packets were made up of paper documents sent via the mail. Since advances in the internet and related technology, in the 21st century most packets were sent electronically. They contained artwork, audio files, photography, video and web pages, in addition to writing. The schedule and format of these packets differed from program to program, and content varied with each student-faculty correspondence. The focus was generally on research, writing, and reflection related to each student&#x27;s individualized study plan.

At regular intervals students compiled their work into &quot;learning portfolios&quot; to submit as part of a Progress Review before a cross-program board of faculty. The board ensured that all students&#x27; work was in compliance with the college&#x27;s degree criteria. Undergraduates had to complete a yearlong Senior Study, accompanied by final graduating presentations of work, before being awarded a degree.

==Facilities==
===Eliot D. Pratt Center and Library===
The Eliot D. Pratt Center and Library in Plainfield, Vermont, served the entire Goddard College community. It was also open to the public. Its holdings contained over 70,000 physical items. The building also housed several administrative offices, an Archives room with artifacts from the 1800s to present, an Art Gallery, and WGDR (91.1 FM), a college/community radio station serving Central Vermont since 1973.

===Goddard College Community Radio (WGDR and WGDH)===
Until 2021, Goddard was home to Goddard College Community Radio, a pair of community-based, non-commercial, listener-supported educational radio stations. WGDR, 91.1 FM, is licensed to Plainfield. Its sister station, WGDH, 91.7 FM, is licensed to Hardwick, Vermont east of Burlington. Goddard College Community Radio was the largest non-commercial community radio station in Vermont. It ws the only non-commercial station in the state other than the statewide Vermont Public Radio network, which received funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. On May 10, 2021, Goddard donated the licenses for WGDR and sister station WGDH to the Central Vermont Community Radio Corporation.

===Haybarn Theatre===
The building was a barn built in 1868 by the Martin Family and one of the largest barns in Central Vermont. The Haybarn was originally used to store hay, grain, and livestock. In 1938, when Goddard College purchased Greatwood Farm, they began the process of adapting the farm buildings into academic and student spaces. The Haybarn was renovated to provide a space for the performing arts.

For almost 75 years the Haybarn Theatre was a place where the local community and the college came together to enjoy and appreciate the arts. The Haybarn hosted educational conferences, student and community performances, and the Goddard College Concert Series. Prior to gaining widespread fame, Phish played multiple concerts there in 1986 and 1987.

==Notable events==
===Alternative Media Conference===
In June 1970 Goddard hosted the Alternative Media Conference; it attracted more than 1,600 radio DJs and others involved in independent media from all over the United States. Featured presenters included Yippie founder Jerry Rubin; spiritual leader Ram Dass; and Larry Yurdin in addition to Danny Fields, Bob Fass, and Paul Krassner from &quot;The Realist&quot;, a magazine.

A music roster of up-and-coming bands was curated by Atlantic Records and included Dr. John and the J. Geils Band. The conference embodied both the political activism and the free-love atmosphere of the time: a coalition affiliated with Panther 21, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Newsreel, Radio Free People, Liberation News Service, Media Women, and &quot;The New York Rat&quot; put together a packet highlighting the political side of alternative media.

A second Alternative Media Conference was held on campus in 2013 to commemorate the college&#x27;s 150th anniversary. Thom Hartmann and Ellen Ratner were featured speakers.

===2014 undergraduate commencement===
In 2014, the graduating class of the college&#x27;s undergraduate program selected convicted murderer and Goddard alumnus Mumia Abu-Jamal to be the commencement speaker. Abu-Jamal, who had attended Goddard as an undergraduate in the 1970s, completed his Goddard degree from prison via mail while serving a sentence for the 1982 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. Faulkner&#x27;s widow criticized the selection of Abu-Jamal as a speaker, as did U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, the Vermont Troopers Association, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. The college&#x27;s interim president, Bob Kenny, supported the right of students to pick a commencement speaker of their choice. On October 5, the school released Abu-Jamal&#x27;s pre-recorded commencement speech.

<text>HMAS &quot;Psyche (formerlyHMS &quot;Psyche) was a protected cruiser built for the Royal Navy at the end of the 19th century. Initially operating on the North America and West Indies Station, the cruiser was transferred to the Australian Squadron in 1903, and remained there until the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) took over responsibility in 1913. After a stint in New Zealand waters and involvement in the Occupation of German Samoa, &quot;Psyche&quot; was paid off in 1915.

At the recommendation of the Australian government, the ship was commissioned into the RAN in 1915, and assigned to patrol the coast of Burma, in response to the threat of a German-instigated uprising. &quot;Psyche&quot; operated in the Bay of Bengal and around Sumatra until 1916, when she was docked at Hong Kong for refit. During this, personnel from the ship were used to commission and man the river gunboat . After the refit&#x27;s conclusion, &quot;Psyche&quot; patrolled in Chinese waters, before returning to the Bay of Bengal. &quot;Psyche&quot; returned to Sydney and was paid off in October 1917, but recommissioned a month later for patrols in Australia&#x27;s northern waters. She was decommissioned for the final time in early 1918. The ship was sold for use as a timber lighter in 1922, and sank in 1940 at Salamander Bay, New South Wales following a storm.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Psyche&quot; was a third-class protected cruiser of the nine-ship &quot;Pelorus&quot;- or P-class. She had a displacement of 2,135 tons, was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion was supplied by inverted three-cylinder triple expansion steam engines, built by Keyham, providing to two propeller shafts. &quot;Psyche&quot; was capable of reaching , although she normally operated at the more economical speedo of .

The cruiser was armed with eight single QF guns, eight single QF 3-pounder guns, two 4.7-inch guns, two field guns, three Maxim machine guns, and two torpedo tubes sited above the waterline. Armour protection was limited to thick section of deck plating over vital areas. The ship&#x27;s company initially stood at 220, but this was later reduced to 188; 12 officers, and 176 sailors.

&quot;Psyche&quot; was laid down for the Royal Navy at HM Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth on 15 November 1897. She was launched on 19 July 1898 by Miss E. Carr, sister of the dockyard&#x27;s admiral superintendent. The cruiser was completed on 28 April 1899, and was placed in reserve until her commissioning on 2 May 1899.

==Operational history==

&quot;Psyche&quot; was commissioned on 2 May 1899 by Captain Francis Raymond Pelly, for service on the North America and West Indies Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda. Ships of the station&#x27;s squadron exercised together in Bermudian waters and were maintained at the dockyard between extensive cruises around the western North Atlantic and the West Indies, visiting various British and foreign ports to &quot;show the flag&quot;. Commander Edmund Moore C. Cooper-Key replaced Pelly in command in June 1901. She was at Bermuda in March 1902, visited Colón, Panama in early May, and Havana in late May 1902; and was in Nicaragua in July 1902, when the government captured revolutionists from an attempted coup. The following month she left Bermuda homeward bound, returning to Devonport on 20 August, to pay off on 5 September when she was placed in the D division of the dockyard reserve.
In December 1903, she was transferred to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Australian Squadron, where she served until October 1913, when the Australia Station was handed to the control of the fledgling RAN. &quot;Psyche&quot; was then assigned to New Zealand waters. In 1914, &quot;Psyche&quot; formed part of the escort for the New Zealand Force which occupied German Samoa (now Samoa). &quot;Psyche&quot; also escorted troop ships heading from New Zealand to the Middle East. She returned to Sydney in late 1914, and was decommissioned on 22 January 1915.

In May 1915, the Australian government suggested to the Admiralty that &quot;Psyche&quot; be reactivated and loaned to the RAN as a training ship. Approval was granted on 1 June, but before the ship&#x27;s 1 July commissioning as HMAS &quot;Psyche&quot;, the Admiralty instead requested that the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board orchestrate a patrol of the Bay of Bengal, in response to the threat of a German-inspired uprising in India and Burma. &quot;Psyche&quot; was hastily fitted out, provided with a ship&#x27;s company consisting primarily of untrained sailors, and sailed on 16 August with for Singapore. From there, the ships sailed to Ragoon, arriving on 10 September with &quot;Psyche&quot;″s captain, Commander Henry Feakes, under instructions to establish patrols along the Burmese coast with the two warships, plus three British India Steam Navigation Company vessels. Command of the Burma Coast Patrol was passed to Captain George Hutter of on 20 September, with Feakes appointed as Senior Naval Officer Burma and overall commander of the three British India vessels and ten coastal launches. For &quot;Psyche&quot;, 10- to 12-day patrols along the Burmese coast were the norm, interspersed with crew training duties.

On 17 January 1916, the demobilisation of the Burma Coast Patrol was ordered, as the threat of insurrection in India and Burma had ceased, and German machinations had focused on the Malay Peninsula. &quot;Psyche&quot; arrived at Penang on 28 January, then sailed three days later for Port Blair. From here, the ship performed patrols of Sumatra. On 12 February, seven stokers refused duty in protest over the poor quality of food being provided to the sailors aboard. All seven were found guilty of disobeying orders, and were punished with prison sentences between 12 and 14 months, plus dismissal from the RAN. The remaining stokers were supplemented by native personnel until 25 April, when replacement RAN personnel arrived. During March, the ship patrolled the Gulf of Siam, and escorted a Russian troop convoy sailing to Europe. During April, further patrols of the Bay of Bengal were made, before &quot;Psyche&quot; sailed to Hong Kong for inspection and refit. During the period from late 1915 to early 1916, &quot;Psyche&quot; served as escort to two ships carrying Turkish prisoners of war, was responsible for the transportation of two Chinese spies (one of whom escaped), and helped capture the ringleaders of an Indian soldiers&#x27; mutiny in Singapore.

During the refit period, personnel from &quot;Psyche&quot; were used to commission the river gunboat on 6 July, and then man her to evacuate European civilians from Canton. The gunboat was halfway up the Pearl River Delta when it was learned that the civilians had been recovered by another vessel, and returned to Hong Kong, where &quot;Moorhen&quot; decommissioned on 23 July. Also during July, sickness ran through the ship, with 67 personnel sent to the naval hospital ashore, while another 41 were treated aboard: about 60% of the ship&#x27;s company were unfit for duty during this period. Recurring illnesses had been a problem while the ship operated in tropical climates, and the ship&#x27;s surgeon recommended the ship be deployed to cooler regions. For one day, the reassignment of flag officers meant that &quot;Psyche&quot; was Flagship of the China Squadron.

Released from dockyard hands on 14 August, &quot;Psyche&quot; began patrols along the Chinese coast, with a marked improvement of the health of all aboard. These continued until 14 October, when the cruiser was assigned to Singapore for further patrols of the Bay of Bengal and Sumatra. In March and April 1917, she was assigned to escort duties between Burma and India. On 11 August, &quot;Psyche&quot; was relieved by , and sailed to Sydney, where she arrived on 28 September.

The ship was paid off on 16 October 1917. &quot;Psyche&quot; was reactivated on 20 November 1917 for service along Australia&#x27;s north-east coast, but after uneventful patrols, she was decommissioned for the final time on 26 March 1918.

==Fate==
The ship was sold to the Moreland Metal Company on 21 July 1922, who used her as a timber lighter. &quot;Psyche&quot; sank in 1940 at Salamander Bay, New South Wales, during a heavy storm, which rolled the ship onto her side. The wreck was used by RAN clearance divers for training between 1950 and 1973, and was later broken up during an underwater demolitions exercise. The remains sit below sea level, around off Roy Wood Reserve.

A memorial to the ship was unveiled at Roy Wood Reserve on 27 June 2015.

<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch G11 is a non-production prototype assault rifle developed from the late 1960s to the 1980s by &quot;Gesellschaft für Hülsenlose Gewehrsysteme&quot; (GSHG) (German for &quot;Association for Caseless Rifle Systems&quot;), a conglomeration of companies headed by firearm manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch (mechanical engineering and weapon design), Dynamit Nobel (propellant composition and projectile design), and Hensoldt Wetzlar (target identification and optic systems). The rifle is noted for its use of caseless ammunition.

It was primarily a project of West Germany, though it was of significance to the other NATO countries as well. In particular, versions of the G11 were included in the U.S. Advanced Combat Rifle program.

In 1990, H&amp;K finished the development of the G11, intended for the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; and other NATO partners. Although the weapon was a technical success, it never entered full production due to the political changes of German reunification and lack of procurement contract. Only 1000 units were ever produced, some of which made their way into the hands of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;. Ultimately, the German armed forces replaced the G3 with the G36.

==History and development==

Development began around 1967 when NATO launched the idea of adopting a second standard small-caliber ammunition. Three competitors were then nominated: one American, another Belgian, and finally the German Heckler &amp; Koch. NATO quickly lost interest in caseless ammunition but the West German Government held on. During 1968–1969, the government of West Germany started a feasibility study into a future assault rifle and three contracts were awarded respectively to Diehl, IWKA Mauser and Heckler &amp; Koch. The terms of reference (specifications) were very general, calling for an improved infantry weapon with a better hit probability than any then in existence, yet fulfilling the FINABEL (named after France, Italy, Netherlands, &quot;Allemagne&quot;, Belgium and Luxembourg) range and rate of fire characteristics. The designers were given a free hand for the methods used, but Heckler &amp; Koch realized that the only way to obtain any significant improvement was to radically change the approach.

From the very beginning, it was obvious the required hit probability could not be achieved with common iron sights. An optical sight was the only solution to improve accuracy to reach the desired range. The Hensoldt AG, having delivered 100,000 optical sights for the G3, cooperated with H&amp;K on developing a small sight with low power magnification which would allow target acquisition with both eyes. However, it was dropped because of the cost. Because the weapon was to be short, only 37 cm would have been left for a sightline, too short for a common iron sight, so that was out of the question. In mid 1968, Hensoldt presented an affordable reflector sight. It was based on an old and nearly forgotten patent, and a modernized model had to be built by a master from the assembly department. On September 30, 1968, Hensoldt was commissioned for a study for further development.

Numerous studies followed in the period between 1970 and 1971. Intensive tests were run by Heckler &amp; Koch and Dynamit Nobel in search of a suitable ammunition. The early side way ignition design gave way to a tail ignition design. By 1970, studies progressed far enough to allow the construction of an automatic single- and 3-shot burst model but without full-automatic operation. Sometime in 1970, the box magazine was selected. To study the dispersion, a model firing 9×19mm and equipped with the reflexive sight was used. It had a cadence of 2400 rpm. The study supposedly was conducted by a research institute of the Fraunhofer Society (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft). To determine the precision, a laser was used, fired onto a film during the 3-shot burst. The free-floating barrel design was found to contribute significantly to the precision of the weapon. At the end of September/beginning October 1971, the weapon was fully completed with full automatic fire and chambered for 4.9 mm and fed from the side.

In January 1973, the defense ministries of West Germany and Great Britain agreed on exchanging information on development of infantry weaponry and ammunition. The agreement was designed to benefit both partners equally. West Germany was to work on caseless ammunition while Great Britain would work on optimizing a firearm for 4.85x45 mm ammunition.

Meanwhile, the German Defence Ministry targeted unveiling of the weapon to NATO in 1975 with a field test of the first weapon to begin in 1976. In the summer of 1973, the ministry took on stock to see that none of the competitors could present a war-ready weapon. Diehl&#x27;s design used separate magazines for projectile and propellant. Mauser offered a three-barrel rifle design. H&amp;K&#x27;s design with a rotating breech was considered promising. 
Together with the Federal Office of Defense Technology and Procurement (FODTP)(Bundesamt für Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung),H&amp;K&#x27;s rotating breech was selected for further study and development.

In early November 1973, at a NATO workshop conference in Brussels, West Germany was appointed to develop the second generation (rifleman) rifle. H&amp;K&#x27;s new weapon was to be presented in sufficient numbers to NATO in April 1977. NATO-wide testing began in 1977 with the goal of having a second smaller caliber weapon alongside the 7.62×51mm NATO round rifle. West Germany wanted to have it ready by then, but the caliber was changed to 4.3 mm, delaying prototype development by months.

In mid 1974, several fully operational &quot;Prototype 1&quot; G11s were presented to the Bundeswehr. On June 14, 1974, the German defense ministry charged the FODTP with initiating the development of the weapon. The proof of performance was held on December 18 and 19, 1974. The achieved firing rates were given as 1800 rpm for burst and 400 rpm for full-automatic. H&amp;K was awarded the development contract (worth 20 million DM) on December 23, 1974. The contract required the completion of development by autumn of 1977, including following field tests. Subsequently, H&amp;K contracted Hensoldt with a continuing development contract.
Around 1975, the design was disclosed as a German small arm Laid-Open Patent application No. 23 26 525.0 and No. 24 13 615.0.

In early 1976, doubt about the viability of the reflex sight rose. The contrast requirements in adverse condition and added features like variable brightness and distance settings drove cost up, exceeding that of a proper scope of similar size. On June 11, 1976, it was decided to switch to a scope. On June 15, 1976, the specification for a scope was finalized and the first model presented on August 5/6, 1976. In November 1977, the FODTP changed the specification accordingly. At the end of the contract in the summer of 1978, it was found to satisfy the requirement.

Meanwhile, the caliber was changed to 4.75 mm with &quot;Prototype 3&quot;. &quot;Prototype 4&quot; and &quot;Prototype 5&quot; equipped with the scope took part in the preliminary NATO field test in 1977 in Meppen. After the contract with the FODTP ended H&amp;K, Dynamit Nobel and Hensoldt were forced to continue development on their own with their private funds. In 1978, Mauser competed with their own weapon chambered for caliber 4.7 mm in a conventional case design but ultimately lost to the H&amp;K G11. The caseless round was not yet telescoped and appeared &quot;conventional&quot;.

On 28 October 1980, NATO approved the standardization (STANAG 4172) of 5.56×45mm NATO as second small caliber cartridge for use within the alliance.

Up to 1982, changes were made following the test. The caliber changed to 4.7×21mm for &quot;Prototype 6&quot;. The conventional nitro-cellulose propellant was replaced by High Ignition Temperatures Propellant (HITP) based on Octogen. The barrel received polygonal rifling. The rifle case received a design by a dedicated designer. This &quot;Prototype 13&quot; became the attention of the numerous media and press. It&#x27;s supposed to be the first version entering the Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) program.

Meanwhile, development shifted yet again to the new caliber 4.73×33mm (DM11) in a telescoped form. In 1984, the &quot;Gesellschaft für hülsenlose Gewehrsysteme&quot; (GHGS), founded by H&amp;K GmbH and Dynamit Nobel AG, completed a license agreement for a custom version (worth US$3.8 million) with the U.S. Department of Defense and for the adoption of caseless ammunition with the Bundeswehr and NATO.

On December 8, 1986, Hensoldt was ready to deliver the final &quot;Zieloptik ZO 1&quot;.

The G11 K1 (K for Konfiguration) production model was completed in March 1987. Field test and troop trials began in June with the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; in Hammelburg and lasted until January 1989. It achieved a 100% higher Ph than the G3. The final development of the ammunition was completed toward the end of 1988 with the same dimensions as 4 years earlier. In March 1989, the first &quot;Operator´s Manual&quot; was made for the G11 K1 for the ACR evaluation. By then, work had already started on the G11 K2. On March 3, 1989, the first five ACR units were shipped to the Aberdeen Proving Ground. In May, H&amp;K began to instruct the testers on how to operate the weapon.

In April 1990, the FODTP certified the G11 for use with the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;. In May 1990, Tilo Möller, then H&amp;K chief of R&amp;D, presented the G11 to military dignitaries. At the same time, the Cabinet of Germany confirmed questions by the Bundestag about the signing of a contract in early 1990 for the adoption of the G11 and that it is part the budget (Haushalt 1990 EPL 14). If it is adopted, the front line troops would receive it first. Adoption numbers would be guided by yearly planned G3 replacement numbers up to the year 2002. The volume of a contract for the Bundeswehr alone was to cover 300,000 units worth 2.7 billion DM. The Cabinet of Germany confirmed that 30 million DM were reserved in the 1989 budget and another planned for the 1990 budget.

In April 1990, the ACR program ended with the decision not to adopt any of the ACR rifles because none met the requirement of doubling hit probability. It was not until mid September 1990 that H&amp;K found out about the cancelation of the preproduction contract.

In November 1990, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) was signed, which puts limits on the numbers of conventional military equipment in Europe and mandates the destruction of excess weaponry.

In January 1992, the Federal Audit Office (&quot;Bundesrechnungshof&quot;) recommended not to procure the G11 just yet and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg struck the G11 from the procurement list. On April 1, 1990, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, leaving West Germany with a surplus of hundreds of thousands of Kalashnikovs. The development of the G11 from 1974 to 1989 had cost the tax payer 84.1 million DM, while leaving H&amp;K with a debt of 180 million DM. H&amp;K was permitted by the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (&quot;Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle&quot;) to export the rifle to 80 countries, and give licenses to 15 countries. On March 8, 1992, the G11 (K2) was approved for full scale replacement production.

On July 17, 1992, the CFE treaty went into effect.

In June 1993, the situation became clear when it was announced that the G11 could not be adopted due to &quot;lack of possibility for NATO standardization&quot;.

In 2004, the Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) program was initiated, which licensed the G11 caseless ammunition. In Phase 1 lasting until January 2005, the HITP formula was reverse engineered and evaluated. In the 28-month-long Phase II, the G11 caseless ammunition was replicated and customized to U.S. Army preferences (higher burn rate). In May 2007, the caseless ammunition was scaled and adapted to the 5.56 mm projectile in a telescoped and round form. An alternative polymer cased version was created in parallel.

==Design details==

The weapon uses 4.73×33mm caseless ammunition, with the propellant shaped into cuboid blocks. The ammunition has also been designated as 4.92mm for the HK G11 ACR, a variant developed for US Military trials, the US convention of groove to groove measurements of the bore was employed, rather than land-land. The projectile is 4.93 mm in diameter with a case length of 33 mm, the US case length measurement is 34 mm since for the ACR trials the chamber length, not the actual case length was used. The 4.73 mm round is half the weight and 40% the size by volume of the 5.56×45mm NATO round. The round was designed to the same ballistics requirement as the 5.56×45mm NATO round as outlined in &quot;Evaluation Procedures for Future NATO Weapons Systems&quot; (Document 14). However, the 4.73mm is much less likely to tumble when hitting or penetrating a soft target, and thus not as lethal. The effect on soft targets is in accordance with international conventions. Even at short range, the round does not fragment in the soft target medium. This was confirmed in tests with gelatine.(See terminal ballistics)

The design principle was to increase target hit probability by firing high rate multi-round bursts (salvos). Tests have been run using a prototype shotgun test-bed called CAWS to see whether a single-shot, multi-projectile system could achieve the range and hit probability requirements. The results indicated that the use of serially fired projectiles at a high rate of fire would achieve a tight shotgun-like pattern with rifle-like accuracy up to the required range.

The rifle was designed to have a dispersion such that a man-target running at a speed of 6 km/h at a distance of 250 m would be hit even if the lead angle error (2 mil) was off by 51 cm.

The weapon itself has three firing modes: semi-auto, full-auto at 460 rounds per minute, and three-round burst at over 2100 cyclic rounds per minute, or approximately 36 rounds per second. The loading and feed mechanism is physically very complicated but exceptionally fast and reliable. Rounds are fed into the weapon from a magazine that lies above and parallel with the barrel. The rounds are oriented vertically (at 90 degrees to the bore) and are fed downwards into the rotary chamber so that they can be rotated 90 degrees for firing. The firing cycle process is roughly:

# As the cocking handle on the side is rotated clockwise by the weapon operator:
# A round is dropped into the revolving chamber vertically (a loading piston assists).
# The chamber rotates 90° so it is lined up with the barrel. This completes the chambering of the round and cocking of the firing pin.
# When the trigger is pulled, a firing pin ignites the primer, which then ignites a powder booster charge that pushes the bullet into the barrel. The solid block of propellant is broken up to increase the ignition surface area and ignites, accelerating the bullet out of the barrel.
# As the projectile is accelerating up the barrel, recoil forces drive the barrel, magazine, chamber and operating mechanism rearwards within the weapon, dissipating energy for single shot and fully automatic modes but allowing burst mode to deliver three projectiles downrange before buffering occurs.
# Gas tapped off from the barrel rotates the chamber and actuates the loading mechanism, then rotating the chamber back to the initial vertical position until it is lined up with the feed mechanism and the process repeats.

A conventional assault rifle has approximately eight steps in its cycle:
# Battery: bolt group pushes round from magazine into chamber.
# Lockup: bolt or bolt carrier locks with the barrel extension or receiver.
# Firing: firing pin or striker impacts primer igniting the main propellant charge.
# Unlocking: either through gas, recoil or blow-back operation, the working parts unlock from the barrel extension or receiver.
# Extraction: spent case is extracted and withdrawn from the chamber.
# Ejection: the spent case is thrown clear of the weapon either via a bolt face ejector or from a fixed or semi-fixed ejector.
# Firing mechanism reset: as part of the rearward reciprocation of the working parts, the firing mechanism is reset.
# Buffering: working parts finally strike the buffer and halt. Recoil spring(s) are fully compressed and begin to drive the working parts forward into battery.

Because the G11 uses caseless ammunition, there are no extraction and ejection steps. Even though the rotary chamber does not lock up in the true sense of the word, the fact that it has to rotate in and out of alignment with the barrel means that the G11 can be considered to have a lock/unlock phase. If a round fails to fire or the weapon is being used with training rounds, the rifle can be manually unloaded by twisting the cocking handle counterclockwise. This pushes the failed/training round out an emergency ejection port on the bottom of the rifle and loads the next round.

The recoil in the three-round burst is not felt by the weapon&#x27;s user until after the third round has left the chamber. This is accomplished by having the barrel and feeding mechanism &quot;float&quot; within the rifle casing. When the rounds are fired, the barrel, magazine, chamber and operating mechanism recoils back against recoil springs several inches. Only when it strikes the buffer at the back of the rifle does the user feel the recoil. During the rearward travel of the internal mechanism the rifle loads and fires 3 rounds. When the barrel and mechanism reaches the rearmost point in its travel, the recoil springs push it forward, back into its normal forward position. When firing in semi-auto and full-auto modes, the rifle loads and fires only one round per movement of the internal mechanism. Fully automatic fire is reduced to around 460 rounds per minute.

The internal workings of the rifle were rather complex compared to those of some earlier designs, with the mechanism being compared to the inside of a compact clock. The number of hours of maintenance required for the G11 compared to other designs is not clear, especially since the effect of the powder used in the caseless ammo remains unknown. Designers claimed that, because there was no ejection cycle, the internal mechanisms would have little chance to get exposed to external dust, dirt and sand, which would supposedly reduce the need for cleaning.

There were reports that the high tolerances required to seal off the front and rear chamber openings set the expected life of the contacting parts to 6000 rounds before maintenance was required.

===Ammunition cook-off and shape===
Premature ignition of ammunition from heat in the chamber, known as cook-off, was a major problem with early prototypes of the G11 where synthetically bound nitrocellulose, formed into blocks, was used. Normally, when a cartridge is fed into a chamber, its case insulates the propellant from igniting until its impact-sensitive primer is struck by a firing pin or striker. The case aids in insulating the propellant from the heat of the chamber and it takes time for the temperature to rise sufficiently inside a chambered round to ignite the propellant. In addition, in a traditional rifle, extracting a hot case removes heat from the system. As a result of doing away with traditional cases, the G11 was found to be unsafe and had to be withdrawn from the 1979 NATO trials. The high rate of fire and lack of cartridge cases made cooking off a significant problem; the heat buildup in the G11 chamber was immense because the chamber had no provision for cooling like a reciprocating bolt system, which allows hot air to leave the chamber when the bolt is retracted and the chamber is exposed to air. The vertically swiveling chamber also made gas sealing at each end at such high pressures impractical, as opposed to a cross-sectional round-inside-round bolt-to-chamber fit with proper gas sealing.

To solve this, Heckler and Koch formed a partnership with Dynamit Nobel, which redesigned the cartridge to use a new high ignition temperature propellant (HITP). The cook-off problem was reduced by using a denatured HMX propellant with a special binder and coating for the ammunition that increased the spontaneous ignition temperature by another 100 °C above that of standard, nitrocellulose (180 °C) propellant.

A notable feature of the new round was its unconventional shape. Most cartridge casings are cylindrical, but the redesigned cartridge was molded into a squared, box-like shape. This allowed the 50-cartridge magazine to carry more propellant in a smaller space; the wasted space between rounds with cylindrical casings was substantially reduced.

The issue of heat removal from caseless-firing weapons as well as methods of igniting them continue to be researched by other companies. An alternative route was taken by the Austrian company Voere, whose Voere VEC-91 uses a caseless, electrically-fired round developed by Austrian inventor Hubert Usel. This technique makes it possible to greatly increase the ignition temperature without hampering the ability to fire it. This would increase the maximum rate and duration a gun could fire before cooking off rounds, but the VEC-91 never took advantage of this, since it was a bolt-action rifle.

The 4.73×33mm projectile was required to defeat NATO and Warsaw Pact armor at 300–400 m (Document 14) but was advertised to meet the requirement at 600 m. This fact was neither confirmed nor denied by the West German government, citing inability to disclose such information.

In line with another NATO requirement for a personal defense weapon (PDW), a handgun concept, &quot;Nahbereichswaffe&quot; (NBW),was created. It was to use a shortened 4.73×25 mm cartridge and meet the same requirements now fulfilled by the HK 4.6×30mm: Armor piercing of NATO CRISAT Technology Area 1 (TA1) out to 300 m; Level II out to 25 m; lethal suppression fire against unarmored targets out to 450 m.

==Future development==
By 2004, the technology developed for the G11 was licensed for the Lightweight Small Arms Technologies project, the current project of which is a light machine gun prototype for the US Army. The design is intended to use either a cased cartridge using a composite case or a caseless ammunition design developed from the G11. Both ammunition designs are telescoped ammunition like that used by the G11; however, the current ammunition design has a plastic case instead of the fully caseless G11 ammunition. The design, like the G11, uses a rotating chamber, but rotating about the longitudinal axis of the weapon.

<doc id="529728" wikidata="Q7743788" url="?curid=529728" title="The Judy Garland Show">
<text>The Judy Garland Show is an American musical variety television series that aired on CBS on Sunday nights during the 1963–1964 television season. Despite a sometimes stormy relationship with Judy Garland, CBS had found success with several television specials featuring the star. Garland, who for years had been reluctant to commit to a weekly series, saw the show as her best chance to pull herself out of severe financial difficulties. Despite it being cancelled relatively early on, it is now revered and considered an important piece of television history.

Production difficulties beset the series almost from the beginning. The series had three different producers in the course of its 26 episodes and went through a number of other key personnel changes. With the change in producers also came changes to the show&#x27;s format, which started as comedy and variety but switched to an almost purely concert format. (In fact, as of episode 20, the on-screen title of the show became Judy Garland In Concert.)

While Garland herself was popular with critics, the initial variety format and her co-star, Jerry Van Dyke, were not. The show competed with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Bonanza&quot;, then the second most popular program on television, and consistently performed poorly in the ratings. Although fans rallied in an attempt to save the show, CBS cancelled it after a single season.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; included the series in their 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;.

==Garland and CBS==
Garland&#x27;s history with CBS prior to the series was a checkered one. She had previously headlined several specials for the network. The first was the inaugural episode of the &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; which aired in 1955. The special, the first full-scale color telecast on CBS, was a ratings triumph, garnering a 34.8 Nielsen rating. This success led to Garland&#x27;s signing a three-year, $300,000 contract () with the network. Only a single special aired, a live &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; episode in 1956, before the pact was terminated. The relationship between CBS and Garland and her then-husband and manager, Sid Luft, dissolved in acrimony in 1957, after they and agent Freddie Fields were unable to come to terms with the network over the format of her next special. Garland filed a US$1.4 million () lawsuit against CBS for libel and breach of contract. (CBS filed a counterclaim) that was not settled until 1961, when Garland and CBS each agreed to drop their claims and negotiations began for a new round of Garland specials for the network.

The first of two specials under this new relationship aired on February 25, 1962. &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; special, guest starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, was nominated for four Emmys. Its success led to CBS signing Garland in December 1962 for her weekly series, premiering in fall 1963. Garland&#x27;s second special, &quot;Judy Garland and Her Guests Phil Silvers and Robert Goulet&quot;, was presented in March 1963. Alternately promoted as a preview and a pilot for Garland&#x27;s upcoming regular series, this special was also nominated for an Emmy.

==Production==
Judy Garland&#x27;s four-year contract for the series called for 26 weekly shows, for which Garland&#x27;s corporation, Kingsrow Enterprises, would be paid $140,000 () per episode. Of that, Garland was guaranteed between $25,000 and $30,000 () per show. Kingsrow Enterprises would also retain ownership of the tapes, allowing Garland to sell the series into syndication. Although Garland had said as early as 1955 that she would never do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation. Garland was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the IRS, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952. The commercial disappointment of the film &quot;A Star is Born&quot; meant that her share of any profits from that film would be eaten up immediately. A successful run on television would secure Garland&#x27;s financial future.

===The George Schlatter episodes (episodes 1–5)===
&quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; was initially slated to be taped in New York City. The network initially offered the producer&#x27;s job to Bob Banner, who was at the time producing a series for Garry Moore. Although he was interested, he declined to relocate from the West Coast. Bob Finkel, whose credits included shows for Dinah Shore and Andy Williams, was next approached but similarly refused to relocate. Veteran producer and director Bill Hobin, then heading up &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot;, was approached to produce and direct the program. Already based in the East, Hobin eagerly accepted. Unbeknownst to Hobin, George Schlatter had been lobbying on the West Coast for the producer job and was signed to produce. Ultimately Hobin bowed out of the producer slot. Schlatter became the producer, while Hobin was retained to direct.

With the producer question settled, Schlatter set about assembling the crew for the series. Mort Lindsey was hired to conduct the show&#x27;s orchestra. Gary Smith, who had designed the earlier Garland/Sinatra/Martin special, was signed as art director. Multiple Academy Award-winner Edith Head was engaged to design Garland&#x27;s costumes, while Ray Aghayan, who Schlatter knew from their work together with Dinah Shore, was hired to costume Garland&#x27;s guests. Mel Tormé was brought on as musical arranger and to write special musical material, and would also appear as a guest on the program. Choreography duties were taken by Danny Daniels. Comedian Jerry Van Dyke was engaged as a series regular. Judy Henske, who appeared in episode 2, didn&#x27;t like the scripts or dialogue she was given in her episode, and turned down the offer to appear on the show regularly.

In addition to musical performances from Garland and the week&#x27;s guest stars, the series&#x27; initial format included the recurring segments &quot;Born in a Trunk&quot; (the name taken from a number in &quot;A Star is Born&quot;), in which Garland would tell stories of her show business career and sing a related song, and &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, which would feature her chatting with a surprise guest. Van Dyke would perform comedy sketches, sometimes with Garland or the guests. Garland would close each episode by singing the song &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Come Back.&quot; The obscure novelty song, selected by Garland and Schlatter over CBS&#x27;s objections (the network wanted her signature song &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;), included the line &quot;And President Coolidge is a cousin of mine.&quot; Garland as a running gag would substitute a different name for Coolidge&#x27;s each week.

Although initially planned for an East Coast shoot, &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network had gone to great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 () to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland&#x27;s dressing room was a 110 by 40 foot trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

The first taping commenced on June 24, 1963. Garland&#x27;s old friend and frequent MGM co-star Mickey Rooney was, at Garland&#x27;s insistence, her first guest—although, because the network elected to air the series out of production order, this was actually the tenth episode to be broadcast.

===The Norman Jewison episodes (episodes 6–13)===
On August 2, after six weeks of taping and five completed shows, Schlatter was fired as producer. Varying reports have Schlatter being fired by James Aubrey, Jr. (president of CBS) or by Garland herself, but in either case, production was suspended for five weeks. Also fired were several of the writing staff and choreographer Danny Daniels. Replacing Schlatter as executive producer was Norman Jewison, who shared a vision for the series that was closer to that of Aubrey&#x27;s. That vision was that Garland was too glamorous for television and that she needed her series to present her in a more conventional light. Veteran musical variety show writers John Aylesworth and Frank Peppiatt were brought in as well. Jewison, who had agreed to serve as producer through the thirteenth episode, implemented changes designed to &quot;make the sacred cow less sacred,&quot; including Garland&#x27;s subjection to Van Dyke&#x27;s jokes that denigrated her issues with her weight, her reputation for unreliability and her career highs and lows. Jewison also introduced a new recurring feature, &quot;Be My Guest,&quot; with Tormé&#x27;s writing tailored material for the week&#x27;s guest to perform with Garland near the top of each show.

&quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; premiered on September 29, during Jewison&#x27;s run as producer. The episode chosen to be the premiere was Jewison&#x27;s second completed episode, the seventh produced episode overall. Reviews were generally favorable (see below), though Jerry Van Dyke&#x27;s supporting role was heavily criticized; Van Dyke was let go from the cast after the tenth produced episode. Jewison himself left after episode thirteen, as he had intended.

===The Bill Colleran episodes (episodes 14–26)===
After Jewison, Bill Colleran joined the show as Garland&#x27;s selection for its third executive producer. Colleran revamped the format yet again, doing away with the insulting humor and focusing the show more on Garland and her singing, although there were still comedy elements in Colleran&#x27;s initial episodes, with guests such as Bob Newhart and Shelley Berman. As well, Ken Murray was briefly featured as a regular, showing his home movies of Hollywood stars, but was dropped after four episodes.

Ratings continued to be poor, and CBS announced the cancellation of &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; on January 22, 1964. Officially, it was reported that it was Garland who exited the series, as explained in a letter released by CBS, supposedly from Garland to Aubrey, advising him that she wanted to spend more time caring for her children.

Despite &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;&#x27;s announced cancellation, it was allowed to finish out the 1963/64 season, and continued to tape episodes for broadcast. The final seven episodes taped after the cancellation notice jettisoned any pretense of sustaining a comedy and variety element, and simply presented Judy Garland &quot;In Concert&quot;—sometimes solo for the entire episode, sometimes with musical guests such as Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll or Mel Tormé.

During these final episodes, following Show 22 specifically, Tormé was fired and was replaced by Bobby Cole, a musician Garland had met recently in New York. Tormé would later file suit for breach of contract and write a tell-all book about the series, &quot;The Other Side of the Rainbow: With Judy Garland on the Dawn Patrol&quot;.

==On the air==
The first episode of &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; aired on September 29, 1963. The show, featuring guest star Donald O&#x27;Connor, was the seventh one taped. Episodes would continue to be shown out of sequence throughout the series&#x27; run. The show scored an 18.7 rating and reviews were largely positive. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;If Judy Garland ... is of a mind to work every week with the same dedication and zeal that characterized her premiere this week, Bill Paley and his associates should be in clover. ... Miss Garland was in fine fettle.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; characterized the show as &quot;tasteful, elegant and exciting.&quot; Not every review was as glowing, with the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; noting &quot;Miss Garland is fine, just fine. The rest of the show, however, needs help.&quot; Other negative reviews were in a similar vein, focusing on Van Dyke in particular and the show&#x27;s format and writing in general.

CBS publicly responded to the critiques by issuing a statement through talent chief Michael Dann. &quot;We have decided that [Judy] should never appear in sketches and never play any character but herself. And she&#x27;ll be singing more songs, more medleys, more standards. Songs are her babies. We told her what we think and she&#x27;s listening. She&#x27;s far too insecure about television to exercise her own judgment. She knows what&#x27;s good for her.&quot;

Behind the scenes, however, the network continued to tinker with the show. In addition to the replacement of key production staff and constantly revising the format, Garland was also summoned to New York to receive such bits of information as she was touching her guests too much and was instructed to stop. As well, Van Dyke was let go almost immediately after the reviews came out, taping his last show on October 11.

Nevertheless, numerous episodes featuring Van Dyke had already completed taping and would continue to air, meaning that the changes in the show&#x27;s format would not be apparent to viewers for several weeks. Accordingly, reviews about the show&#x27;s format (as opposed to Garland&#x27;s singing) continued to be negative, as the Garland-deprecating humor continued to attract criticism rather than viewers. &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; reviewer Richard Warren Lewis wrote, &quot;The absurd notion of debasing Judy&#x27;s reputation as a legendary figure and molding her show into an imitation of other prosaic variety shows has been a disaster where it hurts most, in the audience-rating polls.&quot; Indeed, Garland&#x27;s show was averaging an 18 rating, about half of the audience represented by &quot;Bonanza&quot; and its 35 rating.

After the departure of Jewison as producer and of Jerry Van Dyke (whose exit from the show was lauded by one contemporary reviewer as &quot;a marvelous idea but it came too late&quot;) the focus of the show changed yet again to emphasize Garland&#x27;s performances, singly and with guests. This format, including several &quot;Judy Garland in Concert&quot; solo episodes, would remain more or less intact for the remainder of the series. Despite continuing positive critical comment about Garland&#x27;s performances, the ratings remained flat. Fans of the show formed a &quot;Save The Judy Garland Show committee&quot; and organized an early letter-writing campaign on behalf of the series but their efforts were not enough to spare the show from cancellation. The final &quot;Judy Garland Show&quot;, another concert episode, was broadcast on March 29, 1964.

<doc id="529731" wikidata="Q14711908" url="?curid=529731" title="Green Mountain College">
<text>Green Mountain College was a private liberal arts college in Poultney, Vermont, at the foot of the Taconic Mountains between the Green Mountains and Adirondacks. The college was affiliated with the United Methodist Church and offered a liberal arts undergraduate education with a focus on the environment, and some graduate degrees. For part of its history it was a women&#x27;s college. It was founded in 1834 and closed at the end of the 2018–19 academic year. 

== History ==
Green Mountain was founded in 1834 as Troy Conference Academy, a coeducational Methodist institution. It opened in 1837. In 1863, during a period of private operation, it became Ripley Female College; in 1874 it reopened as a Methodist college, again as Troy Conference Academy. 

In 1937 it was renamed Green Mountain Junior College. Green Mountain became a two-year junior college for women in 1943. In 1974, the school changed its name to Green Mountain College and returned to coeducational status, offering four-year baccalaureate degrees. In the late 1990s the college began to focus on environmental literacy and citizenship.

=== Closure ===
On January 23, 2019, Green Mountain&#x27;s President, Robert W. Allen, announced that, despite a 2018 loan from the Department of Agriculture Rural Development Community Facilities Programs, the college had insufficient income to continue and would close that summer. Arizona&#x27;s Prescott College, which also specializes in the environment and sustainability, agreed to allow Green Mountain students to complete their degrees at Prescott. Prescott also said it would maintain the college&#x27;s student records and hire some Green Mountain faculty. There were approximately 430 students when the college closed. 

The campus was offered for sale and then sold at auction in August 2020 to entrepreneur Raj Bhakta for $4.5 million. In 2024, Bhakta revealed plans to use the college buildings as hotel and condominium space.

== Academics ==
Green Mountain College&#x27;s core courses were known as the Environmental Liberal Arts curriculum, in environmental and natural sciences, writing, reading, history and philosophy. The college offered 23 undergraduate majors and the following graduate degrees: MBA in Sustainable Business; MS in Environmental Studies; MS in Sustainable Food Systems; and MS in Resilient and Sustainable Communities.

It was part of the Eco League, a group of liberal arts colleges committed to environmental sustainability.

=== Progressive program ===
GMC offered an educational track known as the Progressive Program. Based on the ideas of philosopher John Dewey, the students in the program defined their own education goals and worked with faculty members individually to meet them.

== Green campus ==
In 2007, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education awarded Green Mountain College the Campus Sustainability Leadership Award in the &quot;Under 1,000&quot; category. The award recognizes Green Mountain for commitment to environmental sustainability in its governance and administration, curriculum and research, operations, campus culture, and community outreach. GMC was also named the Sierra Club&#x27;s #1 Cool School for 2018.

Green Mountain was named an EPA Energy Star Showcase Campus following campus-wide retrofitting of light fixtures.

Students installed a wind turbine to power the campus greenhouse and solar panels on the roof of the student center. On April 22, 2010, GMC formally opened a new combined heat and power biomass plant costing $5.8m.

Through the Student Campus Greening Fund every GMC student contributed $30 from the college activities fee. Students designed projects and submitted proposals. Awards were based on a student vote. SCGF money was used to install bike racks, purchase recycling bins, use bio-diesel in campus maintenance equipment, and upgrade the alternative energy systems that powered the farm greenhouse.

== Student clubs ==
According to the college, its choral group was the only collegiate choir in the United States with a repertoire of Welsh language music.

== Notable alumni ==

* Amsale Aberra – Ethiopian-born American fashion designer and entrepreneur
* William Duell – actor and singer

<text>Dignity Health Sports Park is a multi-use sports complex located on the campus of California State University, Dominguez Hills, in Carson, California. The complex consists of the 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park soccer stadium, the Dignity Health Sports Park tennis stadium, a track-and-field facility, and the VELO Sports Center velodrome. It is approximately south of downtown Los Angeles, and its primary tenant is the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS). The main stadium was also home to the Los Angeles Wildcats of the XFL in 2020. The LA Galaxy II of MLS Next Pro play their home matches at the complex&#x27;s track and field facility. For the 2017 to 2019 seasons, the stadium served as the temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers NFL team. For 2020 and 2021, the stadium served as the temporary home of the San Diego State Aztecs football team.

Opened in 2003, the $150 million complex was developed and is operated by the Anschutz Entertainment Group. With a seating capacity of 27,000, it is the second largest soccer-specific stadium in the United States, after Geodis Park in Nashville, Tennessee, and the third-largest among its kind in MLS, after Geodis Park and BMO Field in Toronto. During its first decade, the stadium was known as Home Depot Center through a naming rights deal with hardware retailer the Home Depot. In 2013, the name was changed to StubHub Center after naming rights were sold to online ticket marketplace StubHub. The current name, from healthcare provider Dignity Health, debuted in 2019. 

In addition to hosting LA Galaxy games since its opening, the stadium also served as the home of the now-defunct Chivas USA MLS team from 2005 to 2014. The stadium was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) from 2017 to 2019, being the smallest NFL stadium over the course of those three seasons. When the Chargers played at the stadium, the facility was known as ROKiT Field at StubHub Center as part of a &quot;multi-year&quot; agreement with ROKiT.

== History and facilities ==
Originally opened as Home Depot Center in 2003, it was renamed StubHub Center on June 1, 2013. It was renamed Dignity Health Sports Park on January 1, 2019, after Dignity Health signed a new naming rights agreement.

The Los Angeles Chargers funded a $10 million renovation to the stadium in 2017 to prepare for their temporary tenancy. The capacity was increased by 1,000 seats by adding bleachers to the northern grass berm and in two corner sections. A concession area with food trucks and portable restrooms was added to the north side, while stands in the adjacent tennis stadium were opened for use. The luxury suites and press box were also renovated to add capacity.

Two new radio booths were built outside the south side of the press box, and a large new booth on the north side to serve as a security command post for police and NFL officials was constructed. Two booths were added on each side of the press box for the NFL-mandated 20-yard-line television cameras, and a stairway allowing access to the roof of the main box was built to accommodate the 50-yard-line camera. To accommodate 53-man NFL rosters, four small locker rooms were converted to two larger ones with 60 cubicles in each. Also added were small postgame news conference rooms for each team and rooms for game officials and the chain gang. After the Chargers left for Inglewood, the football facilities were taken over by the Wildcats when the XFL team began operations in 2020.

<text>Johnson State College was a public liberal arts college in Johnson, Vermont. Founded in 1828 by John Chesamore, in 2018 Johnson State College was merged with the former Lyndon State College to create Northern Vermont University. 

In July 2023, Castleton University, Northern Vermont University-Johnson, Northern Vermont University-Lyndon, and Vermont Technical College merged to become Vermont State University. 

== History and governance ==

The town of Johnson, and a part of neighboring Cambridge, Vermont together once made up the King&#x27;s College Tract, a land grant chartered by King George III in 1774 for the eventual expansion of King&#x27;s College in New York, today&#x27;s Columbia University. 

Following the Declaration of Independence, and the emergence of the Vermont Republic, the town of was instead granted to William Samuel Johnson (1727-1819) by Vermont&#x27;s Council of Censors in 1782. Johnson represented Connecticut in the Continental Congress, and argued for Vermont&#x27;s admission to the federal Union. (Coincidentally, Johnson would serve as the third President of Columbia University, but this was unrelated to the King&#x27;s College Tract.) 

John Chesamore founded Johnson State College as Johnson Academy, a grammar school instructing students in Greek, Latin, algebra, and geometry. In 1867, the school became a Vermont state &quot;normal school&quot;, a term based on the French &quot;école normale&quot; – a school to educate teachers. Early on Johnson embraced the ideas of learning from experience, and the role of the student in directing some part of their curriculum. The college was among the first Vermont universities to introduce electives. Through the early to mid-twentieth century, Johnson emerged as a college of the liberal arts and natural sciences.

A commitment to educating the whole student in an interdisciplinary manner, begun in the 1920s and 1930s, set in place a history of bringing visiting poets, playwrights, politicians, and artists to the college. 

The original campus was built in the village of Johnson, and over time, the college expanded; slowly building higher upon what is now called College Hill, finally settling upon a plateau above the village with a view of Sterling Mountain and the Sterling Mountain Range. 

On July 1, 2018, Johnson State College and Lyndon State College were merged, creating Northern Vermont University. 

In July 2023, Castleton University, Northern Vermont University-Johnson, Northern Vermont University-Lyndon, and Vermont Technical College merged to become Vermont State University. As a part of Vermont State University, the campus remains a part of the Vermont State Colleges. 

== Athletics ==
Johnson State College teams participated as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Badgers were a member of the North Atlantic Conference (NAC). Men&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. In 2018, women&#x27;s triathlon was added to the varsity sports roster, representing the only NCAA institution in New England to carry women&#x27;s triathlon as a varsity sport.

== Philosophy and academic programs ==
=== Education by engagement ===
Johnson emphasizes the self-development of undergraduate students with what the college terms &quot;education by engagement&quot;. The student is engaged not solely on her or his degree program, but as an adult citizen with emphasis on their place in, and contribution to, their society, nation, and world. After a year of interdisciplinary study, students file a Plan of Study during the sophomore year. This becomes a guiding yet flexible road map for completion of students&#x27; degree work. Degree programs include the natural sciences, business, fine and performing arts, education, mathematics, literature, health sciences, writing and literature, and hospitality and tourism management. 
=== Faculty and students ===
The college has a faculty-student ratio of 1:14. Ninety-one percent of the college&#x27;s faculty hold a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate level terminal degree in their area of instruction. Nearly 60% of undergraduate students come from Vermont, with approximately 40% coming from other U.S. states and more than a dozen nations.

Graduate programs at Johnson include an M.F.A. in Studio Arts, a Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Arts in Counseling. Parts of these programs can be completed with a low residency requirement. Portions of the M.F.A. in Studio Arts program includes course work in conjunction with the Vermont Studio Center, located in the village of Johnson.

==Facilities==
===The Dibden Center for the Arts===
Named for Arthur J. Dibden, president of Johnson State College 1967-69, Dibden oversaw the expansion and development of the fine and performing arts programs. The center is located on the southwest side of the campus and houses the college&#x27;s Dance, Music, and Theater programs as well as gallery exhibition space for the Fine Arts programs. The striking late modernist building, whose sculptural roofline echoes the contours of the Sterling Mountain Range–its backdrop to the south, is the work of architect Robert Burley. Burley apprenticed in the studio of Eero Saarinen. The large 500-seat Dibden Theater with a 44&#x27; proscenium stage is the centerpiece of the performing arts facilities at the center. Excellent acoustics are achieved by a system of hardwood baffles along the walls and ceilings. Practice and instruction rooms wrap around the theater and the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery on the front of the center showcases exhibitions of fine art and design by the college&#x27;s fine art students as well as travelling exhibitions and the work of visiting artists. The Dibden Center for the Arts houses the faculties of the Department of Music and the Department of Theater, a recording studio, music studios, practice rooms, classrooms, and a piano laboratory. Recitals and concerts, theater and contemporary dance performances, and open rehearsals bring performing arts into the daily life of the college. The Vermont Symphony Orchestra performs regularly at the center. Several performing arts series available to the college community, are also available to the public by subscription. The Dibden Center is an important fine and performing arts venue for all of Vermont. One of the best aspects of Dibden is the fact that it is fully student run, both working Front of House and backstage, so there is always learning and working opportunity for students that seek work opportunities and those who would like to learn more about the theater.

===Library and Learning Center===
Johnson&#x27;s Library and Learning Center (LLC) opened in 1996 and incorporates the collections of the older John Dewey Library with expanded collections and new technology. The print collection includes 130,000+ volumes and over 700 journals and periodicals. The LLC houses the largest collections of fine arts publications in Vermont and is a designated National Archives and Records Administration repository. The contemporary, green design building makes use of passive and active solar heating. Its south-southwest orintetation for reading rooms utilizes natural light. The LLC is built of terra cotta brick, Vermont gray granite, Vermont blue-gray slate, steel, and green-tinted glass. The LLC was designed by the architectural firm of Gossens Bachman Architects and has won numerous awards for its architecture and environmental efficiency. Awards include the 1997 American Institute of Architects (AIA) Vermont &quot;Excellence in Architecture Award&quot;. The LLC also houses the faculties of the Department of Humanities, and the Department of Writing and Literature. A skybrige links the LLC with Wilson Bentley Hall. The LLC has become a community centerpiece and serves as a gateway to the northwest side of the quadrangle. An informal outdoor amphitheater facing the quadrangle has become a popular outdoor social area in warmer weather.

===John Dewey Hall ===
John Dewey Hall on the south side of the quadrangle was built in 1963 in the International Style; to house the college&#x27;s library. It is named for the philosopher and educator John Dewey. The building is lit by natural light from a panoramic glass clerestory around the perimeter of the building. Today, the building houses the college bookstore, the office of the dean of students, the Student Association, the Registration and Advising Center, TRIO, academic advising, and career &amp; internship offices.

===Visual Arts Center===
Johnson&#x27;s Visual Arts Center (VAC) houses the college&#x27;s Visual Arts Programs, which was renovated in 2012, with studios for design, drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture, ceramics and woodworking. The Digital Imaging Laboratory (DIL) is also located here with state-of-the-art oversized high-resolution laser CMYK and Inkjet printers. The VAC augments exhibition space at the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery in the Dibden Center with a gallery for exhibiting works in progress and student projects. Exhibitions play a major role in both academic and student life at Johnson. Students have opportunities to show their work beginning in their freshman year. Exhibition programs support and expand the studio curriculum, providing students with frequent opportunities to share their work and receive input; and, by exhibiting faculty and visiting artists&#x27; work, providing insights into teachers’ approaches to making art and critique. Exhibitions in many mediums both of work produced within the college, and by work exhibited by visiting artists exposes students to a wide range of contemporary thinking and art-making methods. Fine arts majors in the freshman and sophomore levels most commonly exhibit work in the VAC. Students in their junior and senior years, especially those presenting thesis level work exhibit in the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery at the Dibden Center for the Arts. 


===Wilson Bentley Science Hall===
Named for the scientist-artist, Wilson Bentley (1865–1931) who first photographed snowflakes in the nineteenth century in nearby Jericho, Vermont. Bentley brought an objective scientific eye to the examination of snow and ice crystals via hugely magnified images called photomicrographs. Bentley published a monograph titled &quot;Snow Crystals&quot; which documented more than 2000 snowflakes and ice crystals. Wilson Bentley Hall, designed by noted architect Robert Burley, houses the faculties of the Department of Mathematics, and the Department of Environmental and Health Sciences. A 200-seat lecture hall with digital projection facilities, an interactive television studio, and laboratories for biology, chemistry, physical sciences, cartography, and geographic information systems. Bentley Hall also houses a state-of-the-art interactive multimedia computer laboratory and is a designated National Science Foundation research facility. The building also houses a meteorological station, and green house.

===The Babcock Nature Preserve===
The Babcock Nature Preserve, located ten miles from Johnson in Eden, Vermont is a 1,000 acre (4 km2) tract of forest land owned and maintained by the college for scientific and educational study. A large, environmentally significant bog, and three large ponds dominate the physical landscape. The Babcock Nature Preserve is a natural laboratory for field biology, ornithology and environmental sciences courses. The summer field program at the Babcock Nature Preserve features a number of intensive courses designed to provide field experience in the environmental and natural sciences.

<doc id="529753" wikidata="Q194712" url="?curid=529753" title="Elseworlds">
<text>Elseworlds is the publication imprint for American comic books produced by DC Comics for stories that take place outside the DC Universe canon. Elseworlds publications are set in alternate realities that deviate from the established continuity of DC&#x27;s regular comics. The &quot;Elseworlds&quot; name was trademarked in 1989, the same year as the first &quot;Elseworlds&quot; publication.

==History==
===&quot;Imaginary Stories&quot;===
The title page of &quot;Superman, Cartoon Hero!&quot; (a slightly retooled reprint of 1942&#x27;s &quot;Superman, Matinee Idol&quot;) stated that the story was &quot;Our first imaginary story&quot;, and continued to say: &quot;In 1942, a series of Superman shorts started showing throughout the U.S.! So, with tongue firmly in cheek, the DC team turned out this story of what might have happened if Lois Lane had decided to see... Superman, Cartoon Hero!&quot; The story opens with Lois determined to learn Superman&#x27;s secret identity and going to the theater to see the Max Fleischer &quot;Superman&quot; short &quot;The Mad Scientist&quot; in hopes of seeing the animated Man of Steel reveal his secret identity. In addition to other things, when the opening credits roll and state that the cartoons are based on DC Comics, Lois Lane states that she has never heard of DC Comics. Clark Kent then wonders if the people there are clairvoyant. In the final panel, Clark Kent exchanges a knowing wink with the image of himself as Superman on the movie screen.

In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #60 (May 1943), &quot;Lois LaneSuperwoman!&quot; told the story of Lois gaining superpowers from a transfusion of Superman&#x27;s blood; while this is explicitly a dream sequence, it has been called &quot;a forerunner of what would be known as &#x27;Imaginary Stories&#x27;&quot;.

Craig Shutt, author of the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; column &quot;Ask Mr. Silver Age&quot;, states that true imaginary stories differed from stories that were dreams and hoaxes. Dreams and hoaxes were &quot;gyps&quot; on account of &quot;not having happened&quot;, whilst true imaginary stories were canonical at least unto themselves. Also, since they were &quot;just&quot; imaginary and thus had no bearing on the characters&#x27; regular stories, imaginary stories could show things like people dying and the victory of evil. In the optimistic and hopeful Silver Age of Comics, such stories usually would not be told; this was hinted with writers telling readers how such an Imaginary Story often reassured the readers that it did not really happen.

Most of these Imaginary Stories featured alternate histories of characters, such as &quot;The Amazing Story of Superman-Red and Superman Blue!&quot;. There, readers saw possible pasts that could have happened, but did not happen. One such story has Superman being raised by apes in imitation of Tarzan, an idea that would be recycled into a later &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale where Tarzan and Superman were switched at birth. Possible present times were shown, such as one story where Jonathan and Martha Kent, touched by pity, adopt a recently orphaned Bruce Wayne and raise him along with their own son, Clark. Thus, the present shows Superman and Batman as brothers, with Clark protecting Gotham and working for the &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot; instead of living in Metropolis, and Batman inviting his foster parents, the Kents, to live with him in Wayne Manor. In keeping with the fact that imaginary stories allowed for much grimmer stories than usual, the story ended with Lex Luthor killing the Kents and Batman trying to murder him in revenge.
Possible futures that &quot;could very well happen&quot; were explored, such as Clark Kent revealing to Lois Lane his secret identity and marrying her. Futures that &quot;perhaps never will&quot; happen were also examined, such as the permanent death of Superman. &quot;Imaginary Stories&quot; appeared often enough that some comics – such as &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; #15 (February 1960), the cover of which appears to depict Superman marrying Lois Lane – had to assure readers that their contents were not &quot;imaginary&quot;. The cover of &quot;Lois Lane&quot; #59 (August 1965), by contrast, promised that its depiction of Lois as the romantic rival of Lara, Jor-El&#x27;s girlfriend and future mother of Superman, was &quot;real--not imaginary!&quot;.

A few &quot;Imaginary Stories&quot; appeared in other DC publications. Batman editor Jack Schiff supervised stories in which the Dark Knight starts a family or loses his identity, though these were revealed at the end of the story to be stories written by Alfred. Schiff&#x27;s stories were notable for the first appearance of the original Bruce Wayne Junior. Writer/editor Robert Kanigher supervised Wonder Woman&#x27;s own series of &quot;Imaginary Stories&quot; called &quot;Impossible Tales&quot; which featured the same principle. There, Wonder Woman appeared along with her younger selves, Wonder Girl and Wonder Tot. The majority of &quot;Imaginary Stories&quot; were published in various Superman comics under the guidance of Superman editor Mort Weisinger, the &quot;King of Imaginary Stories&quot;. This was in part because, according to Shutt, Weisinger aimed for younger readers instead of older ones. Later editors such as Julius Schwartz rarely used the &quot;Imaginary Stories&quot; concept.

Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;?&quot; two-part story in &quot;Superman&quot; #423 and &quot;Action Comics&quot; #583 in 1986 was the last Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; story to use the &quot;Imaginary Stories&quot; label.

===&quot;Elseworlds&quot; imprint===
The first &quot;Elseworlds&quot; title was &quot;Gotham by Gaslight&quot; (1989), written by Brian Augustyn and drawn by Mike Mignola, which featured a Victorian Age version of the superhero Batman hunting Jack the Ripper, who had come to Gotham City. The title was not originally published as an &quot;Elseworlds&quot; comic, but its success led to the creation of the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; imprint and this title was retroactively declared the first &quot;Elseworlds&quot; story. The first book to feature the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; logo was &quot;&quot; in 1991. In 1994, the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; imprint was used as the theme for the annual edition comic books of that summer.

DC sporadically published various &quot;Elseworlds&quot; titles from 1989 to 2003. In August 2003, editor Mike Carlin mentioned that DC had scaled back the production of &quot;Elseworlds&quot; books in order to &quot;put the luster back on them&quot;. Several titles that were announced as &quot;Elseworlds&quot; books prior to this, such as &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations IV&quot; and &quot;The Teen Titans Swingin&#x27; Elseworlds Special&quot;, were cancelled. The planned &quot;Teen Titans&quot; tale was released in January 2008 as the &quot;Teen Titans Lost Annual&quot;.

In September 2009, Dan DiDio revealed the return of the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; imprint as a series of Prestige Format books, with the approach of taking the basic concepts and origins of DC characters and twisting them in various ways. The only &quot;Elseworlds&quot; story released under the initiative was the three-issue miniseries &quot;Superman: The Last Family of Krypton&quot;, published from August to October 2010, which told the story of baby Kal-El reaching Earth with his mother and father and how the world handles the emergence of a superpowered family.

After a 14-year absence, DC relaunched the imprint in 2024 with six titles confirmed:

* &quot;Gotham by Gaslight: The Kryptonian Age&quot; by Andy Diggle and Leandro Fernandez
* &quot;Batman the Barbarian&quot; by Greg Smallwood
* &quot;Dark Knights of Steel: Allwinter&quot; by Jay Kristoff and Tirso Cons
* &quot;Green Lantern: Dark&quot; by Tate Brombal and Werther Dell’Edera
* &quot;Batman: Nightfire&quot; by Clay and Seth Mann
* &quot;DC vs. Vampires: World War V&quot; by Matthew Rosenberg and Otto Schmidt

====Relationship to DC continuity====
Although the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; imprint was created to feature stories separate from DC continuity, concepts from various &quot;Elseworlds&quot; stories were incorporated into DC continuity at various times.

&quot;The Kingdom&quot; miniseries in 1999 brought the 1996 &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; miniseries into DC continuity as part of a series of alternate timelines known as Hypertime, which included some of the alternate worlds depicted in various &quot;Elseworlds&quot; titles.

A new Multiverse was introduced at the conclusion of the &quot;52&quot; weekly series that includes alternate worlds that were previously seen in various &quot;Elseworlds&quot; titles.

==In other media==
&quot;Elseworlds&quot; was the title for the fifth crossover in the Arrowverse franchise, which aired from December 9 to 11, 2018, on The CW. The crossover was told across episodes of &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;Supergirl&quot; and introduced Batwoman, Gotham City, Nora Fries, and Lois Lane to the Arrowverse.

<text>Victor Olegovich Pelevin (; born 22 November 1962) is a Russian fiction writer. His novels include &quot;Omon Ra&quot; (1992), &quot;The Life of Insects&quot; (1993), &quot;Chapayev and Void&quot; (1996), and &quot;Generation P&quot; (1999). He is a laureate of multiple literary awards including the Russian Little Booker Prize (1993) and the Russian National Bestseller (2004), the former for the short story collection &quot;The Blue Lantern&quot; (1991). In 2011 he was nominated for the Nobel prize in Literature. His books are multi-layered postmodernist (disputed) texts fusing elements of pop culture and esoteric philosophies while carrying conventions of the science fiction genre. Some critics relate his prose to the New sincerity literary movement.

== Biography ==
Victor Olegovich Pelevin was born in Moscow on 22 November 1962 to Zinaida Semenovna Efremova, an English teacher, and Oleg Anatolyevich Pelevin, a teacher at the military department of Bauman University. He lived on Tverskoy Boulevard in Moscow, later moving to Chertanovo. In 1979, Pelevin graduated from an elite high school with a special English program located on Stanislavskogo Street in the centre of Moscow, now Kaptsov Gymnasium #1520.

He then attended the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) graduating with a degree in electromechanical engineering in 1985. In April of that year, MPEI Department of Electrical Transport hired him as engineer. Pelevin served in the Russian Air Force. From 1987 to 1989, Pelevin attended the MPEI graduate school.

Pelevin travels to Asia often and has been to Nepal, South Korea, China and Japan. While he does not call himself a Buddhist, he is engaged in Buddhist practices. Pelevin has repeatedly said that despite the fact that his characters use drugs, he is not an addict even though he experimented with mind-expanding substances in his youth. Pelevin is not married.

Pelevin has no current or past public social media accounts (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, VKontakte) 

In December 2018, the media reported that the writer Victor Pelevin registered in the register of individual entrepreneurs in the territorial office of the Pension Fund in Moscow.

==Literary career==
In 1989, Pelevin attended Mikhail Lobanov&#x27;s creative writing seminar at Maxim Gorky Literary Institute. While studying at the Institute, Pelevin met the young novelist Albert Egazarov and the poet Victor Kulle, later a literary critic. Pelevin was expelled from the Institute in 1991. Egazarov and Kulle went on to found a publishing house, first called &quot;The Day&quot;, then &quot;The Raven&quot; and &quot;Myth&quot;, for which Pelevin has edited three volumes of Carlos Castaneda&#x27;s work.

From 1989 to 1990, Pelevin worked as a staff reporter for the magazine &quot;Face to Face&quot;. In 1989, he also began to work in the journal &quot;Nauka i Religiya&quot; (Science and Religion), where he edited a series of articles on eastern mysticism. In 1989, &quot;Nauka i Religiya&quot; published Pelevin&#x27;s first short story &quot;The Sorcerer Ignat and People&quot;.

In 1991, Pelevin published his first collection of stories &quot;The Blue Lantern&quot;. Two years later, it received the Russian Little Booker Prize. In 1994, it received InterPressCon and the Bronze Snail awards. In March 1992, Pelevin published his first novel &quot;Omon Ra&quot; in the literary journal &quot;Znamya&quot;. The novel attracted the attention of literary critics and was nominated for the Booker Prize. In April 1993, the same journal published Pelevin&#x27;s next novel &quot;The Life of Insects&quot;. In 1993, Pelevin published an essay &quot;John Fowles and the tragedy of Russian liberalism&quot; in Nezavisimaya Gazeta. The essay was the writer&#x27;s answer to some negative critics&#x27; reactions to his work. In the same year, Pelevin was admitted to the Russian Union of Journalists.

In 1996, Pelevin participated in the International Writing Program residency at the University of Iowa. That same year, Znamya published Pelevin&#x27;s novel &quot;Chapayev and Void&quot;. Critics called it &quot;the first Zen Buddhist novel in Russian&quot;. The writer himself called it &quot;the first novel which takes place in an absolute vacuum&quot;. In 1997, the novel won for science fiction, and in 2001 it was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award.

In 1999, Pelevin&#x27;s novel &quot;Generation P&quot; was published. Over 3.5 million copies have been sold worldwide. The book received a number of awards including Germany&#x27;s Richard Schoenfeld Prize.

In 2003, Pelevin published the novel &quot;The Dialectics of Transition Period from Out of Nowhere to Nowhere&quot; or &quot;DTP (NN)&quot;, receiving the Apollon Grigoryev Prize in 2003 and the National Bestseller award in 2004. DTP (NN) was also shortlisted for the Andrei Bely Prize in 2003.

In 2006, Eksmo published Pelevin&#x27;s novel &quot;Empire V&quot;. The novel was shortlisted for the Russian Big Book award. The text of &quot;Empire V&quot; appeared on the Internet even before the publication of the novel. Representatives of Eksmo claimed that it was a result of a theft, but some speculated that it was a marketing ploy.

In October 2009, the novel &quot;t&quot; was published. The author received the third award of the fifth season of the Big Book award (2009–2010) and won the reader choice vote.

In December 2011, Eksmo released Pelevin&#x27;s novel &quot;S.N.U.F.F.&quot; which received the E-book award for &quot;Prose of the Year&quot; in February 2012.

Literary critics have noted Pelevin&#x27;s postmodernist and absurdist styles, which incorporate Buddhist motifs, esoteric traditions, and satirical science fiction. Pelevin&#x27;s books have been translated into many languages including Japanese and Chinese. In 2009, the &quot;French magazine&quot; chose Pelevin as one of the 1,000 most significant people in contemporary culture. A 2009 OpenSpace.ru survey voted Pelevin as the most influential intellectual in Russia.

Pelevin is known for not being a part of the literary crowd, rarely appearing in public or giving interviews and preferring to communicate on the internet. When he gives interviews, he talks more about the nature of his mind rather than his writings. This has given grounds for various rumours. For instance, it has been suggested that the writer does not exist and Pelevin is actually a code name for a group of authors or even a computer.

In May 2011, it was reported that Pelevin would personally attend the award ceremony SuperNatsBest, which would have been the writer&#x27;s first appearance in public. However, he did not come.

Pelevin has permitted all of his texts in Russian predating 2009 (except &quot;P5: Farewell songs of the political pygmies of Pindostan&quot;) to be published on the Internet for non-commercial use. Some novels are also available as audio files in Russian.

In December 2010, he wrote a collection of novels and short stories &quot;Pineapple Water for the Fair Lady&quot;, which was in the long list of the Russian Literary Award &quot;Big Book&quot; (season 2010/11).

In December 2011, he released the novel &quot;S.N.U.F.F.&quot;. In February of the following year, this work received the &quot;Electronic Book&quot; award in the &quot;Prose of the Year&quot; category.

In March 2013, Pelevin&#x27;s eleventh novel &quot;&quot;Batman Apollo&quot; was released, which is a sequel to &quot;Empire V&quot;&quot;. Then came the novels &quot;&quot;Love for Three Zuckerbrins&quot;&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot;The Caretaker&quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Lamp, or The Last Battle of the Chekists and Masons&quot; (2016).

In 2017, the novel &quot;iPhuck 10&quot; was published, which won the Andrew White Prize. In 2018, the novel &quot;Secret Views of Mount Fuji&quot; was released. &quot;The Art of Light Touches&quot; was released in August 2019. In August 2020, the novel &quot;The Invincible Sun&quot;&quot; was published.

For the past nine years, the author has been releasing one book a year, it can be a novel or a collection of stories united by a common theme. In the fall of 2021 the book &quot;&quot;Transhumanism Inc&quot;.&quot; was published, which is a collection of stories united by the theme of the concept of transhumanism.

In September 2022, the novel “KGBT+” was published, which is a sequel to the previous novel “Transhumanism Inc.”.

In November 2022, the documentary film &quot;Pelevin&quot; directed by Rodion Chepel was released. The author studied archives and early works of Pelevin, interviewed the writer&#x27;s acquaintances, his childhood friends, colleagues and researchers of the writer&#x27;s work.

In 2023, the novel “Journey to Eleusin” was published. It also became the sequel to two previous novels, “KGBT+” and “Transhumanism Inc.”.

In September 2024, it was revealed that Victor Pelevin will release a new novel &quot;Krut&#x27;&quot;. Sales of the new book started on October 3, 2024.

==Literary style==
Pelevin&#x27;s prose, creating a mythologized and multi-layered picture of reality, is built on the interweaving of the fantastic and the real, the historical and the fictional. In the spirit of postmodernism, it abounds in hidden quotations, allusions, the game semantic clichés, and irony. Buddhist symbolism neighbours in it with occultism, European philosophy with mysticism, didacticism with parody, and active presence of realities of modern culture with an appeal to archaic consciousness. But, he employs postmodernist devices for humanistic ethos.

Pelevin&#x27;s works are characterized by the mixing of elements of different genres — adventure novel and parable, fairy tale and anecdote, pamphlet and utopia.

In a conversation with &quot;BOMB Magazine&quot;, Pelevin named Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; as an early influence on his reading, saying, &quot;The effect of this book was really fantastic. [...] This book was totally out of the Soviet world.&quot; Pelevin avoids, however, listing authors who have specifically influenced his writing, for he believes that &quot;the only real Russian literary tradition is to write good books in a way nobody did before.&quot;

<text>Nowra () is a city in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. It is located south-southwest of the state capital of Sydney (about as the crow flies). As of the 2021 census, Nowra has an estimated population of 22,584. Situated in the southern reaches of the Sydney basin, Nowra is the seat and commercial centre of the City of Shoalhaven.

The region around Nowra is a farming community with a thriving dairy industry and a significant amount of state-owned forest land. It is also an increasingly popular retirement and leisure area for people from Canberra and Sydney. The naval air station HMAS &quot;Albatross&quot; is located about south-west of Nowra.

==History==

Prior to European arrival, the part of the Nowra region south of the Shoalhaven river was inhabited by the Wandi-Wandandian tribe of the Yuin nation, while the region north of Shoalhaven was inhabited by the Dharawal people. The name Nowra, originally written by Europeans as &#x27;nou-woo-ro&#x27; (pronounced Nowa Nowa by the Indigenous Australians of the area), is an Aboriginal word for the black cockatoo.

Circa 1824, ex-convict Mary Reibey applied for a land grant in the Burrier area, on the southern side of the Shoalhaven River. The Nowra township was officially recognised in 1852. Less than ten years later, in 1861, a postal service was established. In 1861, the racehorse Archer, which was trained in Nowra by Etienne de Mestre, won the first Melbourne Cup. Nowra was declared a town in 1885 and a city in 1979.

A major landmark in the area is the house Bundanon, which renowned Australian artist Arthur Boyd and his wife Yvonne donated to the people of Australia in 1993 along with an adjoining property that had been previously owned by Boyd&#x27;s brother-in-law, the equally famous Australian artist Sidney Nolan. Bundanon began as a single-storey weatherboard structure built around 1840. In 1866, a two-storey sandstone house, made of locally quarried stone, was built immediately in front of the original weatherboard house. The sandstone house features timber verandas and is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.
== Heritage listings ==
Nowra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Pleasant Way: Graham Lodge
* 35 West Street: Meroogal

==Geography==
Along the north of Nowra is the Shoalhaven River, which formerly hosted the Australian National wakeboarding championships and is a popular fishing location. The Nowra Bridge connects it to North Nowra and Bomaderry. The Shoalhaven River is a saltwater river, although it does not flow into the sea. The Shoalhaven River meets the sea through the canal that joins the Shoalhaven and Crookhaven Rivers, which was dug by convicts under the direction of local entrepreneur and pioneer Alexander Berry.

=== Climate ===
Nowra possesses a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), with very warm, wet summers and mild, relatively dry winters. Compared with nearby Wollongong and Kiama which have an oceanic climate, Nowra has slightly warmer summers due to its inland location, thus qualifying it as humid subtropical climate. Average maxima vary from in January to in July, while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. Annual precipitation is moderately high (averaging ), and is spread across 86.7 precipitation days (over ). Due to its position on the leeward side of the Great Dividing Range, Nowra experiences a foehn effect, particularly in late winter and spring. The town experiences 99.6 clear days and 127.4 cloudy days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 21 December 2019 to on 24 August 2002.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2021 census, Nowra has a population of 22,584. This covers suburbs only south of the Shoalhaven River. The population is slightly younger than the state and country as a whole, with an average age of 37 compared to 38 for both Australia and New South Wales. However, the population is bimodally distributed, with a larger percentage of children and the elderly than the state and national averages. 79.7% of the population were born in Australia and 82.1% speak only English at home, both above the state and national averages.

Nowra has a lower level of tertiary education than typical for the state and nation. Only 15% of the population of Nowra hold a tertiary qualification, compared to 23.3% of Australia and 23.8% of New South Wales.

The top five reported ancestries in Nowra at the 2021 census were Australian (40.9%), English (37.7%), Australian Aboriginal (10%), Irish (9.5%), and Scottish (8.3%). Most (63%) people had both parents born in Australia, higher than the state and national averages.

The population of the suburb of Nowra (central Nowra) at the 2021 census was 9,956. The Australian Bureau of statistics also recognises a larger built-up area including suburbs north of the Shoalhaven, North Nowra-Bomaderry, which had a population of 16,098 at the 2021 census.

==Economy==
Nowra Town Hall was built in 1948 and is in the Central Business District. This district contains many services, including banks, health services and a library.

Nowra has a growing tourist industry, especially in the summer months, when visitors (mostly from Sydney and Canberra) flock to the beaches to enjoy swimming, surfing, fishing, shopping, and relaxing in the restaurants and cafés.

Nowra sits in the Shoalhaven region, where there are several vineyards.

==Education==
Nowra has three public high schools: Nowra High School, Shoalhaven High School and Bomaderry High School. There are also several non-government schools, three of which are religiously affiliated:
* Nowra Christian School: a K–12 Christian-based school located in South Nowra
* Nowra Anglican College: a K–12 Anglican college in Bomaderry
* St John the Evangelist Catholic High School: a Catholic systemic high school on the outskirts of Nowra, affiliated with St Michael&#x27;s Catholic Primary School in Nowra
The district also has an independent school of special assistance. The Shoalhaven River College commenced classes in 2019 and enrols 60 students in years 9–12 in the mainstream curriculum. 

There are seven public primary schools in the Nowra area: East Nowra Public School, Nowra Public School, Bomaderry Public School, Illaroo Road Public School, North Nowra Public School, Nowra Hill Public School, and Terara Public School.

The University of Wollongong has a campus in Nowra, and there is a campus of TAFE NSW Illawarra Institute in Bomaderry.

==Health==
There are two hospitals in Nowra: the Shoalhaven District Memorial Hospital, which is a hub for oncology services, and Nowra Private Hospital.

==Media==
Nowra is served by local radio stations, including 2ST 999 and Power FM 94.9, Shoalhaven FM 104.5 and various ABC stations. Nowra also receives 5 free-to-air television channels from Knights Hill, commercial channels Seven, WIN and Network 10, and public broadcasters ABC and SBS. Due to tropospheric ducting from Newcastle in the Shoalhaven area via Knights Hill, a translator site at Cambewarra Mountain in Nowra North is an alternative source of television reception and assists those affected by the Newcastle ducting.

== Sports ==

The four major codes of football in Australia are all popular in the Nowra area. Rugby league was traditionally represented by the Nowra Warriors and Bomaderry Swamp Rats, however, at the end of 2007 these teams merged to form the Shoalhaven Jets Rugby League Football Club. Other rugby league teams in the Shoalhaven area include the St Georges Basin Dragons, Culburra Dolphins, Sussex Inlet Panthers and Berry Magpies, all of whom source some of their players from Nowra. All of these clubs compete in the Group 7 Rugby League competition.

Rugby union is represented by the Shoalhaven Rugby Club, who play out of Rugby Park in South Nowra. The club won the 2008 premiership in the Illawarra district competition, and has produced international and provincial players such as Andrew Walker and Alex Kanaar. 

Australian rules football is played by two clubs from the Shoalhaven area, with the Bomaderry Tigers playing at Artie Smith Oval. Further south, the Bay and Basin Bombers play at the Leisure Centre at Vincentia. These two clubs are both members of the South Coast AFL, fielding junior and senior teams. 

The Shoalhaven Mariners were established in 2006 and represent the area in the sport of baseball. The team plays home matches out of Fred Finch Park in Berkeley, Wollongong. Baseball has a new venue at the South Nowra Soccer Complex. The Shoalhaven Tigers represent the area in the New South Wales State Basketball League and have won several championships from 1988 until 2007.

Archer was an Australian thoroughbred racehorse trained in the Nowra area who won the first and the second Melbourne Cups in 1861 and 1862. He won both Cups by a significant margin. Archer is one of only five horses to have won the Melbourne Cup on two or more occasions, and one of only four horses to have won two successive Cups.

== Public transport ==

Nowra Coaches operates services from Nowra to Bomaderry, Huskisson, Vincentia and Jervis Bay. Shoal Bus operates services from Nowra to Berry, Gerringong and Sussex Inlet. Premier Motor Service operates express services along the Princes Highway from Sydney to Eden that call at Nowra.

Nowra has no direct rail connection, but the Illawarra railway line terminates at nearby Bomaderry railway station with NSW TrainLink operating services to Kiama and Sydney.

<text>Chinook winds, or simply Chinooks, are two types of prevailing warm, generally westerly winds in western North America: Coastal Chinooks and interior Chinooks. The coastal Chinooks are persistent seasonal, wet, southwesterly winds blowing in from the ocean. The interior Chinooks are occasional warm, dry föhn winds blowing down the eastern sides of interior mountain ranges. The coastal Chinooks were the original term, used along the northwest coast, and the term in the interior of North America is later and derives from the coastal term.
* Along the Pacific Northwest coast, where the name is pronounced (&#x27;chin&#x27;+&#x27;uk&#x27;), the name refers to wet, warm winds off the ocean from the southwest; this is the original use of the term. The coastal Chinook winds deliver tremendous amounts of moisture both as rain along the coast and snow in the coastal mountains, that sustain the characteristic temperate rainforests and climate of the Pacific Northwest.

* In North American western interior, the same name is used for föhn winds, generally, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains lie immediately east of various interior mountain ranges. There the name is pronounced (&#x27;shin&#x27;+&#x27;uk&#x27;). The same warm, wet coastal winds can also become the warm föhn winds on the eastern sides of mountain ranges, after having lost their moisture on the western sides; however, due to expanded use of the term in the interior for any föhn wind, interior Chinooks are not necessarily originally coastal Chinooks.

In the interior of North America, the Blackfoot people call these winds the &quot;snow eater&quot;; however, the more commonly used term &quot;Chinook&quot; originates from the name of the eponymous Chinook people, who lived near the ocean, along the lower Columbia River, where the term was first derived. The reference to &quot;a Chinook&quot; wind or weather system originally meant, to euro-American settlers along the Pacific Northwest coast, a warming wind from the ocean blowing into the interior regions of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.

A strong föhn wind can make snow deep almost vanish in one day. The snow partly sublimates and partly melts and evaporates in the dry wind. Chinook winds have been observed to raise winter temperature, often from below to as high as for a few hours or days, then temperatures plummet to their base levels.

Its speed is generally between 16 km/h (10mph) and 60 km/h (37.5mph), gusting to 100 km/h (62.5 mph).

==In the Pacific Northwest==

&quot;Chinook&quot; is used for coastal Chinook winds in British Columbia, and is the original use of the term, being rooted in the lore of coastal natives and immigrants, and brought to Alberta by French-speaking fur-traders. Such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest.
These same winds have more recently been called the pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii.

The air associated with a coastal Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon; most of the region&#x27;s stormy winds come when a fast &quot;westerly&quot; jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash.

When a coastal Chinook comes in when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the tropical dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls and the cold spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm coastal Chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week.

The effects on the Interior of British Columbia when a coastal Chinook is in effect are the reverse. In a rainy spell, most of the heavy moisture will be wrung out of the rising air as a consequence of crossing over the mountain ramparts before the air mass descends (and hence warms and dries) into the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson River-Okanagan area. The effects are similar to those of an Albertan interior Chinook, though not to the same extreme, partly because the Okanagan is relatively warmer than the Prairies, and partly because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between Kelowna and Calgary. When the coastal Chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will give way to a slushy melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain.

===Pronunciation in the Pacific Northwest===
The word &quot;Chinook&quot; remains in common use among local fishermen and people in communities along the British Columbia Coast, and coastal Washington and Oregon, and in particular, the term is used in the Puget Sound area of Washington. Coastal &quot;Chinook&quot; is not pronounced &quot;shin-uk&quot; () as it is in the interior, east of the Cascades, but is in the original coastal pronunciation &quot;chin-uk&quot; ().

In British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest, the word Chinook was predominantly pronounced . However, the common pronunciation current throughout most of the inland Pacific Northwest, Alberta, and the rest of Canada, is , as in French. This difference may be because it was the Métis employees of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, who were familiar with the Chinook people and country, brought the name east of the Cascades and Rockies, along with their own ethnic pronunciation. Early records are clear that &quot;tshinook&quot; was the original pronunciation, before the word&#x27;s transmission east of the Rockies.

=== First nations myth from British Columbia ===

Native legend of the Lil&#x27;wat subgroup of the St&#x27;at&#x27;imc tells of a girl named Chinook-Wind, who married Chinook Glacier, and moved to his country, which was in the area of today&#x27;s Birkenhead River. She pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. They came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and told her they were coming to get her. They came in great number and quarrelled with Glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and in the end she went home with them.

==Chinooks in Alberta and eastern British Columbia==

Interior Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada, especially in a belt from Pincher Creek and Crowsnest Pass through Lethbridge, which get 30–35 Chinook days per year, on average. Interior Chinooks become less frequent further south in the United States, and are not as common north of Red Deer, but they can and do occur annually as far north as High Level in northwestern Alberta and Fort St. John in northeastern British Columbia, and as far south as Las Vegas, Nevada, and occasionally to Carlsbad, in eastern New Mexico.

In Pincher Creek, the temperature rose by , from , in one hour on 6 January 1966. During the winter, driving can be treacherous, as the wind blows snow across roadways, sometimes causing roads to vanish and snowdrifts to pile up higher than a metre. Empty semitrailer trucks driving along Highway 3 and other routes in southern Alberta have been blown over by the high gusts of wind caused by interior Chinooks.

On 27 February 1992, Claresholm, Alberta, a town just south of Calgary, recorded a temperature of ; again, the next day was recorded.

=== Clashing with Arctic air mass ===
The interior Chinooks can seem to battle with Arctic air masses at times.

This clash of temperatures can remain stationary, or move back and forth, in the latter case causing such fluctuations as a warm morning, a bitterly cold afternoon, and a warm evening. A curtain of fog often accompanies the clash between warm to the west and cold to the east.

=== Chinook arch ===

Two common cloud patterns seen in the interior during this time are a chinook arch overhead, and a bank of clouds (also referred to as a cloud wall) obscuring the mountains to the west. The bank appears to be an approaching storm, but does not advance any further to the east.

One of its most striking features of the interior Chinook weather system is the &quot;Chinook arch&quot;, a föhn cloud in the form of a band of stationary stratus clouds, caused by air rippling over the mountains due to orographic lifting. To those unfamiliar with it, the Chinook arch may at times look like a threatening storm cloud, however, the arch clouds rarely produce rain or snow. They can also create stunning sunrises and sunsets.

A similar phenomenon, the nor&#x27;west arch, also a föhn cloud, is seen in eastern New Zealand.

The stunning colors seen in the Chinook arch are quite common. Typically, the colours will change throughout the day, starting with yellow, orange, red, and pink shades in the morning as the sun comes up, grey shades at midday changing to pink / red colours, and then orange / yellow hues just before the sun sets.


=== Cause of occurrence ===
The interior Chinook is a föhn wind, a rain shadow wind which results from the subsequent adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes (orographic lift). As a consequence of the different adiabatic rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the windward slopes.

Sometimes the interior Chinooks are caused by the same air flow as the coastal Chinooks:
As moist winds from the Pacific (coastal Chinooks) are forced to rise over the mountains, the moisture in the air is condensed and falls out as precipitation, while the air cools at the moist adiabatic rate of The dried air then descends on the leeward side of the mountains, warming at the dry adiabatic rate of 

The turbulence of the high winds also can prevent the usual nocturnal temperature inversion from forming on the lee side of the slope, allowing night-time temperatures to remain elevated.

Quite often, when the Pacific Northwest coast is being drenched by rain, the windward (western) side of the Rockies is being hammered by snow (robbing the air of its moisture), and the leeward (eastern) side of the Rockies in Alberta is basking in a föhn Chinook. The three different weather conditions are all caused by the same flow of air, hence the confusion over the use of the name &quot;Chinook wind&quot;.

=== Interior Chinooks and gardening on Great Plains ===
The frequent midwinter thaws by interior Chinooks in Great Plains country are more of a bane than a blessing to gardeners. Plants can be visibly brought out of dormancy by persistent, warm interior Chinook winds, or have their hardiness reduced even if they appear to remain dormant. In either case, they become vulnerable to later cold waves.

Many plants which do well at Winnipeg – where constant cold maintains dormancy throughout the winter – are difficult to grow in the Alberta Chinook belt. Examples include basswood, some apple, raspberry, and juneberry varieties, and Amur maples. Native trees in the interior Chinook-affected areas of Alberta are known to be small, with much less growth than the same species growing in areas not affected by interior Chinook winds. This is once again caused by the &quot;off-and-on&quot; dormancy throughout winter.

=== Health ===
Interior Chinook winds are said to sometimes cause a sharp increase in the number of migraine headaches suffered by the locals. At least one study conducted by the department of clinical neurosciences at the University of Calgary supports that belief. They are popularly believed to increase irritability and sleeplessness.

In mid-winter over major centres such as Calgary, interior Chinooks can often override cold air in the city, trapping the pollutants in the cold air and causing inversion smog. At such times, it is possible for it to be cold at street level and much warmer at the tops of the skyscrapers and in higher terrain.

== Chinooks and föhn winds in the inland United States ==
In the North American western interior, winds that are generally called föhn winds by meteorologists and climatologists are called &quot;Chinooks&quot;. Regardless of the name, föhns can occur on the leeward side of any nearby mountain range. The föhns called &quot;Chinook winds&quot; are seen throughout most of inland western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountain region. Montana especially has a significant amount of föhn winds throughout much of the state during the winter months, but particularly coming off the Rocky Mountain Front in the northern and west-central areas of the state.

On rare occasions, Chinook winds generated on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains have reached as far east as Wisconsin.

== Records ==
Loma, Montana has the world record for the most extreme temperature change in a 24-hour period. On January 15, 1972, the temperature increased from , a change in temperature.

Spearfish, South Dakota holds the world record for the fastest increase in temperature. On January 22, 1943, the temperature increased from , a change in temperature. This occurred in just 2 minutes.

Spearfish, South Dakota also holds the world record for the fastest decrease in temperature, for the same day. On January 22, 1943, the temperature decreased from , a change in temperature. This occurred in 27 minutes.

Rapid City, South Dakota had the world record for the fastest decrease in temperature. On January 10, 1911, the temperature decreased from , a change in temperature.

== Squamish winds, williwaws, and Chugach föhns ==
The resulting outflow wind is more or less the opposite of British Columbia / Pacific Northwest coastal Chinook. These are called a squamish in certain areas, rooted in the direction of such winds coming down out of Howe Sound, home to the Squamish people, and in Alaska are called a &quot;williwaw&quot;. They consist of cold airstreams from the continental air mass pouring out of the interior plateau via certain river valleys and canyons penetrating the Coast Mountains towards the coast.

A similar, local föhn wind regularly occurs in the Cook Inlet region in Alaska, as air moves over the Chugach Mountains between Prince William Sound and Portage Glacier. Anchorage residents often believe the warm winds which melt snow and leave their streets slushy and muddy are a midwinter gift from Hawaii, following a common mistake that the warm winds come from the same place as the similar winds near the coasts in southern British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.

<text>Lyndon State College was a public liberal arts college in Lyndon, Vermont. In 2018, it merged with Johnson State College to create Northern Vermont University; the former campus of Lyndon State College is now the university&#x27;s Lyndon campus. In July 2023, Castleton University, Northern Vermont University-Johnson, Northern Vermont University-Lyndon, and Vermont Technical College merged to become Vermont State University. It is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

==History==
In 1911, the college was founded as a one-year normal school housed in rented space in nearby Lyndon Institute. Consistent with education tradition of the times, the Lyndon Training Course expanded its curriculum in one-year increments, and the first two-year class graduated in 1923. In 1927, Rita Bole became principal of the school. The first three-year class, consisting of nine students, graduated in 1934. In 1944, the state allowed Lyndon to grant four-year degrees so long as it remained a teacher training institution. The first four-year degrees were granted to 18 students in 1944. 

Bole, who led the school until 1955, encouraged the Vermont State Legislature to establish Lyndon Teachers College, saw the admission of the first male and first out-of-state students during the 1940s, and oversaw the move to the Theodore Newton Vail estate. Vail had been instrumental in the establishment of Lyndon Institute, and Bole recognized his vacant estate as the perfect place to house the growing school. The move to Vail Manor was completed on June 30, 1951, the final day of the school&#x27;s lease at Lyndon Institute.

In 1961, the State Legislature established the Vermont State Colleges system, a consortium of Vermont&#x27;s five public colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor and Council of Presidents and Lyndon Teachers College became Lyndon State College. This marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth and, in 1964, the campus began to expand. A library, a dormitory, a dining hall, a science wing, a gymnasium, and a theater were built. These additions began meeting the needs of a growing student population that also brought a rapid expansion of the Lyndon curriculum. In the 1970s, new majors were developed in business administration, special education, recreations, meteorology, communications, human services, and physical education. It was also during this decade that the original Vail Manor was deemed unsafe and was replaced with the Theodore N. Vail Center that now houses the Vail Museum and preserves the name that has become an integral part of the Lyndon State tradition.

In 2005, a new residence hall was constructed near Wheelock Hall. The building was named The Rita L. Bole Complex, after the principal of Lyndon Normal School.

In 2009, the Academic and Student Activity Center, a LEED-certified, or &quot;green&quot; building, was constructed to house Lyndon&#x27;s Business, Exercise Science and Meteorology majors. It also contains computer labs, classrooms and a student event center.

In September 2016, the VSC board of trustees voted to merge Lyndon State College with Johnson State College, located roughly away. The new combined institution was named Northern Vermont University, and JSC President Elaine Collins was named as NVU&#x27;s first president to oversee the consolidation of both campus into the new university. 

In July 2023, Castleton University, Northern Vermont University-Johnson, Northern Vermont University-Lyndon, and Vermont Technical College merged to become Vermont State University.

==Campus==
The Vail Center had classrooms, and teachers&#x27; offices, including English, mathematics, and education. It also contained the bookstore, student center, and snack bar. The science wing contained classrooms and laboratories. There was a television wing for the television studies and was home to News 7, LSC&#x27;s daily live broadcast facility. It also contained the small Alexander Twilight Theater. It was connected to the Library and Academic Center (LAC).

LAC contained classrooms, a 24-hour computer lab, and the three-floor Samuel Read Hall Library.

The Harvey Academic Center was located at the center of campus and housed offices and classrooms for Recreation Studies and other programs.

The center of campus was centered around a small pond until the summer of 2019. It was filled in and made into a park. There was a large pond across from the library. Adjacent to the park was the Stevens Dining Hall.

Adjacent to the theater was the Stannard Gymnasium. The smaller gym, known as the Rita Bole Gymnasium (there is also a Rita Bole residence hall) was used for basketball games, floor hockey, and a wide variety of intramural sports. In this complex was a swimming pool, racquetball court, rock climbing wall, and a fitness center.

On the north side of the campus, across from the baseball fields, was the Brown House containing a dispensary. The Gray House was a special residential opportunity, most recently for those performing service to the community.

==Student life==
===Residence Halls===
Half of the student population lived on campus in one of the nine residence halls. The Stonehenge residence hall complex was located on the southern end of campus and consisted of six residence halls: Whitelaw/Crevecoeur (first-year students), Arnold/Bayley, and Poland/Rogers. They were clustered around a central courtyard and shaped in a circle, hence the nickname &quot;Stonehenge.&quot; Wheelock was a residence hall in the center of campus. Rita Bole was the newest of the residence halls, which featured apartment-style living for upperclassmen. The ninth hall, Grey House, was a living-learning community dedicated to performing community service on campus and in the local area.

==Athletics==
Lyndon State College teams participated as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Hornets were a member of the North Atlantic Conference (NAC). Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer and tennis; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. Club sports teams included men&#x27;s ice hockey, men&#x27;s rugby, women&#x27;s rugby, ultimate frisbee and a dance team. which included:

<text>HMAS &quot;Rockhampton&quot; (J203/M203), named for the city of Rockhampton, Queensland, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Rockhampton&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Rockhampton&quot; had a slightly wider beam than other &quot;Bathurst&quot; class corvettes; greater.

&quot;Rockhampton&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 6 November 1940, launched on 26 June 1941, and commissioned into the RAN on 21 January 1942.

==Operational history==
&quot;Rockhampton&quot; began her career as a convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. Following a series of Japanese submarine attacks along the east coast of Australia, a convoy system was established. &quot;Rockhampton&quot; and escorted the first Sydney to Brisbane convoy. The corvette remained in this role until January 1944, when she began escorting convoys to and from New Guinea. She underwent refit in Sydney over April and May 1944, before returning to escort duties in New Guinea waters. &quot;Rockhampton&quot; operated in both Australian and New Guinea waters up until the end of World War II.

Following the end of the war, &quot;Rockhampton&quot; was involved in the rescue of Dutch and Indonesian prisoners-of-war and the occupation of Ambon. On 8 October 1945, the corvette carried the Sultan of Ternate on his return home. &quot;Rockhampton&quot; returned to Sydney in November 1945, where she was assigned to minesweeping duties off the east coast of Australia. She later participated in survey duties off the coast of South Australia, before returning to Sydney on 29 April 1946.

The corvette received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1944&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Rockhampton&quot; paid off to reserve on 5 August 1946, and was sold to Kino Shito (Australia) Pty Ltd for scrap on 6 January 1961. She departed Australia for Japan under tow by the tug &quot;Benton Maru&quot; in 1962.

<text>HMAS &quot;Rushcutter&quot; (M 80) was one of two Bay class minehunters built for the Royal Australian Navy by Carrington Slipways at its Ramsay Fibreglass facility in Tomago, New South Wales. She was launched on 8 May 1986 and commissioned on 1 November 1986. She was decommissioned on 14 August 2001. She and sister ship were sold in 2002 for service in the Persian Gulf. At some point before 2013, the vessel ended up in private hands in Rozelle Bay.

<text>Fictional [[Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom|colleges]] are found in many modern novels, films, and other works of fiction, probably because they allow the author greater licence for invention and a reduced risk of being accused of libel, as might happen if the author depicted unsavory events as occurring at a real-life institution. Below is a list of some of the fictional colleges of the University of Oxford.

==&quot;His Dark Materials&quot;==
Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; novels feature a number of fictional Oxford colleges, most notably Jordan College, including:
*Cardinal&#x27;s College
*Foxe College
*Gabriel College
*Jordan College
*Queen Philippa&#x27;s College
*St Michael&#x27;s College
*St Scholastica&#x27;s College
*St Sophia&#x27;s College
*Wordsworth College
*Wykeham College

==Inspector Morse==
The Inspector Morse series of books by Colin Dexter is predominantly set within Oxford and its environs, including the University. Consequently, many fictional colleges are named. The derived television series, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;, continued this practice.

&quot;T&quot;=TV series
==&quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;==
Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; is set in Christminster, &quot;Wessex&quot;, a thinly fictionalised version of Oxford, and mentions the following colleges of Christminster University:
*Biblioll College (Balliol)
*Cardinal College (Christ Church)
*Crozier College (Oriel?)
*Oldgate College (New College)
*Rubric College (Brasenose?)
*Sarcophagus College
*Tudor College

==&quot;Loss and Gain&quot;==
&quot;Loss and Gain&quot; by St John Henry Newman tells the story of the conversion of Charles Reding, an Oxford student, to Catholicism. In the novel, Newman creates the following colleges:
*Saint Saviour&#x27;s (the college of the main character, Charles Reding)
*All Saints
*Leicester College
*Nun&#x27;s Hall

==Other works==
==Fictional library==
* In Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of London&quot; series, Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian Library has a secret part, known and accessible only to practitioners of Magic and containing among other things the secret writings of Isaac Newton on this subject.

<doc id="529780" wikidata="Q220229" url="?curid=529780" title="Railroad tie">
<text>A railroad tie, crosstie (American English), railway tie (Canadian English) or railway sleeper (Australian and British English) is a rectangular support for the rails in railroad tracks. Generally laid perpendicular to the rails, ties transfer loads to the track ballast and subgrade, hold the rails upright and keep them spaced to the correct gauge.

Railroad ties are traditionally made of wood, but prestressed concrete is now also widely used, especially in Europe and Asia. Steel ties are common on secondary lines in the UK; plastic composite ties are also employed, although far less than wood or concrete. As of January 2008, the approximate market share in North America for traditional and wood ties was 91.5%, the remainder being concrete, steel, azobé (red ironwood) and plastic composite.

Tie spacing may depend on the type of tie, traffic loads and other requirements, for example on North American mainline railroads to on London, Midland and Scottish Railway jointed track. 

Rails in North America may be fastened to the tie by a railroad spike; iron/steel baseplates screwed to the tie and secured to the rail by a proprietary fastening system such as a Vossloh or Pandrol are commonly used in Europe.

==Types==

===Stone block===

The type of railroad tie used on the predecessors of the first true railway (Liverpool and Manchester Railway) consisted of a pair of stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses to tread the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found that it was hard to maintain the correct gauge. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on soft ground, such as at Chat Moss, where timber ties had to be used. Bi-block ties with a tie rod are somewhat similar.

===Wooden===

Historically wooden rail ties were made by hewing with an axe, called axe ties, or sawn to achieve at least two flat sides.
A variety of softwood and hardwood timbers are used as ties, oak, jarrah and karri being popular hardwoods, although increasingly difficult to obtain, especially from sustainable sources. Some lines use softwoods, including Douglas fir; while they have the advantage of accepting treatment more readily, they are more susceptible to wear but are cheaper, lighter (and therefore easier to handle) and more readily available. 

Softwood is treated, with creosote being the most common preservative for railway ties. Other preservatives used include pentachlorophenol and chromated copper arsenate. Sometimes non-toxic preservatives are used, such as copper azole or micronized copper. New boron-based wood preserving technology is being employed by major US railroads in a dual treatment process in order to extend the life of wood ties in wet areas. Some timbers (such as sal, mora, jarrah or azobé) are durable enough that they can be used untreated.

Problems with wooden ties include rot, splitting, insect infestation, plate-cutting, also known as chair shuffle in the UK (abrasive damage to the tie caused by lateral motion of the tie plate) and spike-pull (where the spike is gradually loosened from the tie). Wooden ties can catch fire; as they age they develop cracks that allow sparks to lodge and more easily start fires.

===Concrete===
Concrete ties are cheaper and easier to obtain than timber and better able to carry higher axle-weights and sustain higher speeds. Their greater weight ensures improved retention of track geometry, especially when installed with continuous-welded rail. Concrete ties have a longer service life and require less maintenance than timber due to their greater weight, which helps them remain in the correct position longer. Concrete ties need to be installed on a well-prepared subgrade with an adequate depth on free-draining ballast to perform well. It is a common misconception that concrete ties amplify wheel noise. A study done as part of Euronoise 2018 proved this false, showing concrete sleepers to be an average of 2dB(A) quieter than wooden ones, however with a greater acoustic sharpness on straight stretches of track. Concrete ties were however shown to be quieter than wooden ties almost universal across the audible frequency band on curves. This causes train noise when over concrete ties to potentially be subjectively perceived as louder than train noise over wooden ties.

On the highest categories of line in the UK (those with the highest speeds and tonnages), pre-stressed concrete ties are the only ones permitted by Network Rail standards.

Most European railways also now use concrete bearers in switches and crossing layouts due to the longer life and lower cost of concrete bearers compared to timber, which is increasingly difficult and expensive to source in sufficient quantities and quality.

===Steel===

Steel ties are formed from pressed steel and are trough-shaped in section. The ends of the tie are shaped to form a &quot;spade&quot; which increases the lateral resistance of the tie. Housings to accommodate the fastening system are welded to the upper surface of the tie. Steel ties are now in widespread use on secondary or lower-speed lines in the UK where they have been found to be economical to install due their ability to be installed on the existing ballast bed. Steel ties are lighter in weight than concrete and able to stack in compact bundles unlike timber. Steel ties can be installed onto the existing ballast, unlike concrete ties which require a full depth of new ballast. Steel ties are 100% recyclable and require up to 60% less ballast than concrete ties and up to 45% less than wood ties.

Historically, steel ties have suffered from poor design and increased traffic loads over their normally long service life. These aged and often obsolete designs limited load and speed capacity but can still be found in many locations globally and performing adequately despite decades of service. There are great numbers of steel ties with over 50 years of service and in some cases they can and have been rehabilitated and continue to perform well. Steel ties were also used in specialty situations, such as the Hejaz railway in the Arabian Peninsula where the dry, hot climate made wood ties unsatisfactory.

Modern steel ties handle heavy loads, have a proven record of performance in signalized track, and handle adverse track conditions. Of high importance to railroad companies is the fact that steel ties are more economical to install in new construction than creosote-treated wood ties and concrete ties. Steel ties are utilized in nearly all sectors of the worldwide railroad systems including heavy-haul, class 1s, regional, shortlines, mining, electrified passenger lines (OHLE) and all manner of industries. Notably, steel ties (bearers) have proven themselves over the last few decades to be advantageous in turnouts (switches/points) and provide the solution to the ever-growing problem of long timber ties for such use.

When insulated to prevent conduction through the ties, steel ties may be used with track circuit based train detection and track integrity systems. Without insulation, steel ties may only be used on lines without block signaling and level crossings or on lines that use other forms of train detection such as axle counters.

===Plastics===
In more recent times, a number of companies are selling composite railroad ties manufactured from recycled plastic resins and recycled rubber. Manufacturers claim a service life longer than wooden ties with an expected lifetime in the range of 30–80 years, that the ties are impervious to rot and insect attack, and that they can be modified with a special relief on the bottom to provide additional lateral stability. In some main track applications the hybrid plastic tie has a recessed design to be completely surrounded by ballast.

Aside from the environmental benefits of using recycled material, plastic ties usually replace timber ties soaked in creosote, the latter being a toxic chemical, and are theoretically recyclable. However, plastics may shed microplastics and leach other possibly toxic chemicals such as ultraviolet inhibitors.

Hybrid plastic railroad ties and composite ties are used in other rail applications such as underground mining operations, industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad ties are also used to replace individual rotted wood ties, which will result in intermingled hybrid and wood ties and continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast. This is due to better damping properties of hybrid plastic ties and composite ties, which will decrease the intensity of vibrations as well as the sound production. In 2009, Network Rail announced that it would begin replacing wooden ties with recycled plastic. but I-Plas became insolvent in October 2012.

In 2012, New Zealand ordered a trial batch of &quot;EcoTrax&quot; brand recycled composite ties from Axion for use on turnouts and bridges, and a further three-year order in 2015, but then Axion filed for bankruptcy in December 2015, though it continues to trade. These ties are developed by Dr. Nosker at Rutgers University.

Composite sleepers, manufactured from various recycled plastics, were introduced in Wiltshire, United Kingdom, in 2021. They were installed as an alternative to wooden sleepers, on a bridge where concrete sleepers would have been too heavy. Although it was the first instance of plastic sleepers being installed on mainline track in the country, they have previously been used on narrow-gauge railways.

Ties may also be made from fiberglass.

==Non-conventional tie forms==

===Y-shaped ties===
An unusual form of tie is the Y-shaped tie, first developed in 1983. Compared to conventional ties, the volume of ballast required is reduced due to the load-spreading characteristics of the Y-tie. Noise levels are high but the resistance to track movement is very good. For curves the three-point contact of a Y steel tie means that an exact geometric fit cannot be observed with a fixed attachment point.

The cross section of the ties is an I-beam.

As of 2006, less than of Y-tie track had been built, of which approximately 90 percent is in Germany.

===Twin ties===
The ZSX Twin tie is manufactured by Leonhard Moll Betonwerke GmbH &amp; Co KG and is a pair of two pre-stressed concrete ties longitudinally connected by four steel rods. The design is said to be suitable for track with sharp curves, track subject to temperature stress such as that operated by trains with eddy brakes, and bridges, and as transition track between traditional track and slab track or bridges.

===Wide ties===
Concrete monoblock ties have also been produced in a wider form (e.g. ) such that there is no ballast between the ties; this wide tie increases lateral resistance and reduces ballast pressure. The system has been used in Germany where wide ties have also been used in conjunction with the GETRAC A3 ballastless track systems.

=== Bi-block ties ===

Bi-block (or twinblock) ties consist of two concrete rail supports joined by a steel bar. Advantages include increased lateral resistance and lower weight than monobloc concrete ties, as well as elimination of damage from torsional forces on the ties center due to the more flexible steel connections. This tie type is in common use in France, and are used on the high-speed TGV lines. Bi-block ties are also used in ballastless track systems.
They are gauge-convertible by cutting and welding the steel bar to the dimension that suits the new gauge.

=== Frame ties ===
Frame ties () comprise both lateral and longitudinal members in a single monolithic concrete casting. This system is in use in Austria; in the Austrian system the track is fastened at the four corners of the frame, and is also supported midway along the frame. Adjacent frame ties are butted close to each other. Advantages of this system over conventional cross increased support of track. In addition, construction methods used for this type of track are similar to those used for conventional track.

===Ladder track===

In ladder track, the ties are laid parallel to the rails and are several meters long. The structure is similar to Brunel&#x27;s baulk track; these longitudinal ties can be used with ballast, or with elastomer supports on a solid non-ballasted support.

==Dimensions and spacing==

===Current usage===

====North America====

The crosstie spacing of mainline railroad is approximately for wood ties or for concrete ties. The number of ties is 3,250 wooden crossties per mile (2,019 ties/km, or 40 ties per 65 feet) for wood ties or 2,640 ties per mile for concrete ties. 

===Historical usage===

====United Kingdom====

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway specified 18 sleepers per rail and 24 sleepers per rail, both of which correspond to 2,112 sleepers per mile.

Sleepers are long, wide and deep. The two sleepers adjacent to a joint may be wide where the formation is soft or the traffic is heavy and fast. Sleepers are mostly spaced apart (centre-to-centre) but are closer adjacent to fishplated rail joints where the spacing sequences are as follows with the spacing at .

The fractional inch spacing at the fishplate corresponds to the thermal expansion gap allowed between the rail ends.

* &quot; rails&quot; – 

===United States===
Interurban railways of the late 1800s and early 1900s generally ran lighter rolling stock than mainline steam railways, but roadbeds were built to similar standards. Wooden ties were placed at approximately intervals.

==Fastening rails to railroad ties==

Various methods exist for fixing the rail to the railroad ties. Historically spikes gave way to cast iron chairs fixed to the tie, more recently springs (such as Pandrol clips) are used to fix the rail to the tie chair.

==Other uses==
In recent years, wooden railroad ties have also become popular for gardening and landscaping, both in creating retaining walls and raised-bed gardens, and sometimes for building steps as well. Traditionally, the ties sold for this purpose are decommissioned ties taken from rail lines when replaced with new ties, and their lifespan is often limited due to rot. Some entrepreneurs sell new ties. Due to the presence of wood preservatives such as coal tar, creosote or salts of heavy metals, railroad ties introduce an extra element of soil pollution into gardens and are avoided by many property owners. In the UK, new oak or pine beams of the same length (2.4m) as standard railway sleepers, but not treated with dangerous chemicals, are available specifically for garden construction. In some places, railroad ties have been used in the construction of homes, particularly among those with lower incomes, especially near railroad tracks, including railroad employees. They are also used as cribbing for docks and boathouses.

The Spanish artist Agustín Ibarrola has used recycled ties from Renfe in several projects.

In Germany, use of wooden railroad ties as building material (namely in gardens, houses and in all places where regular contact to human skin would be likely, in all areas frequented by children and in all areas associated with the production or handling of food in any way) has been prohibited by law since 1991 because they pose a significant risk to health and environment. From 1991 to 2002, this was regulated by the &quot;Teerölverordnung&quot; (Carbolineum By-law), and since 2002 has been regulated by the &quot;Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung&quot; (Chemicals Prohibition By-law), §1 and Annex, Parts 10 and 17.

<text>Bungonia Caves are a series of caves near the city of Goulburn, New South Wales, Australia.

== Overview ==

The caves are sited within the Bungonia State Conservation Area adjoining the Morton National Park, about east of Goulburn and about south-west of Sydney.

The caves are formed in limestone at the southern extremity of the Sydney basin, a broad expanse of New South Wales between this point, the city of Newcastle in the north, the town of Lithgow to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east.

The caves are precipitous in many places and entry is limited. The presence of &quot;Foul air&quot;, dangerous levels of CO2 or O2, is common in the Bungonia caves, especially in summer and in The Grill Cave in particular.

One of the more well-known caves, The Drum Cave, is an important bat breeding site. The Large Bent-wing Bat (formerly known as the Common Bent-wing Bat), is listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot; under the Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995) in New South Wales. Drum Cave is closed annually from 1 November through to 1 April in order to provide a safe environment for the bats during their breeding season, but is open and available to the public for the remainder of each year. The importance of Drum Cave for the preservation of the Large Bent-wing Bat is underscored by the fact that the next closest suitable breeding cave is located near Wee Jasper. Grill Cave is also normally closed for the month of December as a bat staging cave. Chalk Cave is closed 1 May to 30 September for bat hibernation over winter; entry to these caves during these periods carries a fine.

Many fossils can be found along the various walking tracks in the vicinity of the caves. There are also colour-coded bushwalks through the area.

== List of caves ==
There are over 190 caves at Bungonia, though some of these are not much more than small holes in the ground. They include:
*The Drum Cave
*The Blowfly Cave
*The Grill Cave
*Argyle Cave
*Chalk Cave
*College Cave
*Mass &quot;cathedral&quot; cave
*Canberra Hole
*Odyssey (Note: Closed. For research use only)
*Fossil cave – Hogans Hole
*System
*Spider
*Acoustic Pot
*Condom Cave – (Named After the map shape)

<doc id="529783" wikidata="Q56064" url="?curid=529783" title="Colonia del Sacramento">
<text>Colonia del Sacramento (; ) is a city in southwestern Uruguay, by the Río de la Plata, facing Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is one of the oldest towns in Uruguay and the capital of the Colonia Department. It has a population of around 27,000.

Its historic quarter is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Modern Colonia del Sacramento produces textiles and has a free trade zone, in addition to a polytechnic centre and various government buildings.

==History==

Following the restoration of the Portuguese crown, King Peter II sought the resolution of the southern border of Brazil. Manuel Lobo with 5 ships containing about 400 soldiers, craftsmen, carpenters and stonecutters, and 18 guns, reached San Gabriel Island on 20 January 1680. On 28 January, they commenced establishing a post.

José de Garro sent spies from Santo Domingo de Soriano on 22 February 1680, after receiving a negative response on 10 February to his ultimatum to leave the site. Garro sent a force of 3,400 men under the command of Antonio de Vera Mujica, capturing the besieged town on the night of 6–7 August 1680. Lobo was taken as a prisoner to Buenos Aires, where he died on 7 January 1683. A treaty between Spain and Portugal signed in 1681 returned Colonia to Portugal.

Field Marshal Duarte Teixeira Chaves arrived off the San Gabriel islands on 25 January 1683, and commenced to rebuild the settlement. Field Marshal Cristóvão Dornelas Abreu was its governor until 1690, when Dom Francisco Naper de Lencastre took over. Smuggling, and cattle hunting from the Banda Oriental, were the main components of the colony&#x27;s economy. Lencastre ordered the building of houses of stone and mud with tile roofs, the enlargement of the city walls, and the addition of a fortified tower. The colonists grew wheat, hemp flax, and grape vines, and exported cattle hides to Rio de Janeiro, while importing wood and foodstuffs. Sebastião da Veiga Cabral took over as governor in 1699.

As a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession, the governor of Buenos Aires, Valdes Incian, initiated the Siege of Colonia del Sacramento. The forces of the Spanish governor were commanded by Baltazar García Ros from 18 October 1704 until 14 March 1705, when the colonists were evacuated by Portuguese ships. Only the churches and bridge remained undestroyed.

The colony was given back to Portugal in the Treaty of Utrecht. Manuel Gomes Barbosa took possession on 10 February 1718 with 1,040 colonists. More colonists arrived in 1721. Antonio Pedro de Vasconcellos took over as governor on 14 March 1722 and transformed it into the richest and best-defended city in the Rio de la Plata region. This included the coastal bastions of São Pedro de Alcântara, São Miguel, Santo António, São João, Carmo, and Santa Rita.

Another attack during the Spanish–Portuguese War (1735–1737), failed. Don Luis Garcia de Bivar took over as governor in 1749, but died on 5 March 1760. During that time, the Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750) was never complied with and was finally considered null and void. Brigadier Vicente da Silva da Fonseca then took over as governor. Fonseca was forced to surrender the colony to Pedro Antonio de Cevallos on 11 October 1762. Spain returned the colony in the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau, and Dom José Pedro de Figueiredo Sarmento took over as governor on 27 December 1763. He was replaced by Francisco José da Rocha on 15 March 1777.
With the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1777, the colony became a Spanish possession once more.

It then transferred to Portuguese control again, being later incorporated into Brazil after 1816, when the entire &quot;Banda Oriental&quot; (Uruguay) was seized by the government of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and renamed the Cisplatina province.

On 10 January 1809, before the independence of Uruguay, it was designated as a &quot;Vila&quot; (&quot;town&quot; in 19th century Portuguese) and has since been elevated to the status of &quot;Ciudad&quot; (&quot;city&quot; in Spanish).
Since independence, Colonia del Sacramento has expanded to the north and east, but the original &quot;Bairro Histórico&quot; (historic quarter in Portuguese or &quot;Barrio Histórico,&quot; current Spanish spelling) retains its irregular, terrain-fitting street plan built by the Portuguese, contrasting with the wider, orthogonal &quot;calles&quot; in the newer Spanish area.

In 2022, it was confirmed Uruguay planned to create a Silicon Valley-style new city in Colonia called Colonia Ala Este, to entice Argentine immigrants due to Argentina&#x27;s poor economic situation. This would double Colonia&#x27;s population to about 60,000 people. With an initial investment of more than US$100 million, it was planned to build a sustainable city open to the community as a hub for the knowledge economy industry on a 500-hectare site, which includes forests and seven kilometers of coastline, with beaches such as Calabrés and Fernando.

===Timeline of rule===
The rule from 1680 to present (with flag of the period) is:

==Population==

==Geography==
===Climate===
Colonia del Sacramento has a mild humid subtropical climate, described by the Köppen climate classification as &quot;Cfa&quot;. Summers are warm and winters are cool, with relatively frequent frosts and fog. The precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year, with an average of 1,039 mm (40.91 in), and the annual average temperature is 17 °C (63 °F).

==Urban fabric==
The city was developed on a peninsula that protrudes into the Río de la Plata. The 16-hectare &quot;Barrio Histórico&quot;, or Portuguese Old City, was enclosed by a fortification wall across the peninsula in the site of present-day Calle Ituzaingó. Most of the fortification wall was removed in 1777 and some remaining parts again in 1859. The Portuguese part of the city has an irregular street network.

Outside the wall, the historical part of the city was planned in the Spanish colonial style and in the characteristic checkerboard layout.

==Sport==
The local professional football team is Plaza Colonia, founded in 1917, playing at the Estadio Profesor Alberto Suppici. They won the 2016 Clausura, their biggest success to date.

Deportivo Colonia, founded in 1999, lost its professional status in 2007. They play at the Estadio Miguel Campomar.

Club Atlético Plaza has futsal, volleyball and basketball sections, as well as a football section based at Estadio Néstor Naviliat.

The town&#x27;s Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos is a disused bullring which has been renovated and repurposed as a performing arts venue.

==Points of interest==
The &quot;Barrio Histórico&quot; (historic quarter) section of Colonia del Sacramento is designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It has some cobblestone streets built by the Portuguese in the 17th century, and is within walking distance of the town&#x27;s ferry terminal. Among the tourist attractions around the tree-lined &quot;Plaza Mayor&quot; (main square) are:
*&quot;Portón de Campo&quot; – the City Gate and wooden drawbridge
*Lighthouse and convent ruins of the 17th-century Convent of San Francisco

<text>The National Soccer League (NSL) was the top-level soccer league in Australia, run by Soccer Australia and later the Australian Soccer Association. The NSL, the A-League&#x27;s predecessor, spanned 28 seasons from its inception in 1977 until its demise in 2004, when it was succeeded by the A-League competition run by Football Federation Australia, the successor to the Australian Soccer Association.

During the history of the NSL the league was contested by a total of 42 teams; 41 based in Australia and one based in New Zealand. Seasons initially ran during the winter seasons, until 1989 when this was changed to the summer season. In 1984, the league was split into two conferences (Northern and Southern) to introduce more teams into the competition; the league returned to a single division in 1987. The competition was known by various names through sponsorships; these names included the [[Philips]] Soccer League, the Quit National Soccer League, [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic Airways]] Soccer League, [[Coca-Cola]] Soccer League, the [[Ericsson]] Cup and the A-League.

From the league&#x27;s inaugural season to its demise in 2004, a total of 13 clubs were crowned champions through either a system of first past the post or a finals series that culminated in a grand final. The NSL was Australia&#x27;s first national sporting league predating the likes of the AFL and NRL.

==History==

===Origin===
Competition between club sides from different states existed in various forms prior to the formation of the NSL. The petroleum company Ampol sponsored cup competitions in the various states, starting with New South Wales in 1957, with other states following later. Later a national Ampol Cup was conducted which continued throughout the 1960s. From 1962 until 1968 an Australia Cup was held, but its ambition of becoming an FA Cup style knockout competition went unfulfilled. In the 1970s the top sides from Melbourne and Sydney played off in an end of season series, but the tournament did not seem to quite capture the legitimacy and popularity that was hoped for.

Plans for a national home and away league went back as far as 1965 for a 1967 start, and were followed up by variations on the theme throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, but faced opposition variously from clubs, who deemed the notion uneconomical, and state federations who feared losing their power. Australia&#x27;s qualification for the 1974 World Cup led to various discussions in 1975 and 1976, with eventually 14 teams being chosen to participate in the inaugural season of the national league.

The transition from state-based leagues to a national competition was not all smooth. The Victorian Soccer Federation was reluctant for its big clubs to be involved and it appeared the dream of Alex Pongrass of St George and Frank Lowy of Hakoah Sydney for a nationwide club competition would not evolve. Little-known Mooroolbark from Melbourne&#x27;s outer eastern suburbs broke the deadlock by joining the competition, bringing three other Victorian sides with it, making the national league a reality.

===1977–1983: Sydney dominance===
The first seven seasons of the league would be dominated by Sydney clubs, with Sydney City winning four titles, and only West Adelaide being able to wrest the title from New South Wales. West secured the 1978 championship after scoring a late equaliser in an Adelaide derby against Adelaide City in the final round of the season. The competition at this stage was a simple first past the post. A post season finals series was played during this era but was considered more of an exhibition series rather than a legitimate game to decide the national champion, although some confusion still exists on this matter particularly amongst some Heidelberg supporters who consider the 1980 &#x27;final&#x27; as a legitimate decider.

===1984–1986: Conference system and power shift===
Shrinking crowds led to the radical move of introducing more teams (mainly from Victoria and New South Wales) and splitting the league into two conferences, with the winner of each division to play-off in an end of year two legged final. For season 1984 the &#x27;Australian&#x27; Conference had competing teams from New South Wales and the ACT, whilst the &#x27;National&#x27; Conference consisted of Victorian, South Australian and Queensland clubs. For 1985 and 1986 this reverted to &#x27;Northern&#x27; and &#x27;Southern&#x27; Conferences. Strangely, the competition&#x27;s most geographically northern sides, Brisbane Lions and Brisbane City were in the latter grouping.

This period saw South Melbourne become the first Victorian team to win the league, followed by Brunswick Juventus, and Adelaide City, all Southern conference sides. At the end of the 1986 season, the system was scrapped, and about half the teams were dumped back to their respective state leagues. The criteria used to decide who stayed and who went was based 50% on the 1986 playing record, 40% on past playing record, and 10% on crowd support. The result was that only one team from outside Sydney and Melbourne, reigning champions Adelaide City, was retained.

===1987–1989: Return to single division and last years of winter football===
The revamped league suffered a major setback early on when Sydney City pulled out of the competition after just one round into the new season. Apart from returning to a single division, the league also dispensed with finals for the 1987 season, reverting to first past the post. Many considered this an ill-considered move, as it robbed the league of its most high-profile games. Finals were re-introduced from 1988, and were to remain until the league&#x27;s demise. The 1989 season would be the last to be played in winter. This period saw a re-emergence of New South Wales dominance with all titles, minor premierships and runners-up being from that state.

===1989–1996: Birth of summer football===
Attempts to shift the league towards a summer season went back into the early 1980s, but only came to pass for the 1989/90 season. The rationale for this change was simple. The league would avoid being marginalised in the media during the peak of the Australian Football League and Australian Rugby League seasons, as well as providing better playing surfaces and spectator comfort owing to the better weather.

The impetus given to the league from the switch was not enough for some clubs to remain in the league, with many clubs being relegated or being demoted back to the state leagues, including former champions Brunswick Juventus, St George and APIA Leichhardt, as well as once upon a time contenders in Heidelberg and Preston.

This coincided with a renewed push by soccer authorities to force clubs to market themselves to mainstream Australia, as opposed to their own mostly migrant fan bases. These policies included name and logo changes, as well as the banning of ethnic flags, changes which were begrudgingly agreed to by the clubs, though in the terraces the fans generally continued to chant the old names. Marconi, South Melbourne, Adelaide City and the Melbourne Knights were the dominant sides of this era, with numerous titles and grand final appearances between them.

Stars such as Mark Viduka, Mark Bresciano, Vince Grella, Tony Popovic and Mark Schwarzer debuted in this decade and would later form the core of the Australian Golden generation.

===1996–2001: New clubs and attempts to enter the mainstream===
From 1996 onwards the league attempted to revitalise the competition and attempt to hook into the mainstream support by finally introducing a team from Western Australia, in the form of Perth Glory, as well as other new entities which promised to deliver mainstream support, as well as being fully professional outfits as opposed to the majority of clubs and players who were only semi-professional. Among the new clubs at this time were the Collingwood Warriors, Carlton, Northern Spirit (GHFA Spirit as of 2004) and Parramatta Power, as well as New Zealand&#x27;s first professional team, the Football Kingz.

These clubs would have varying degrees of success on and off the field. Collingwood Warriors barely managed to last a season, while Carlton reached the grand final in its debut year, but was unable to attract a substantial fan base. Northern Spirit started off with record crowds, and a good debut season reaching the finals, but gradually crowds declined, and financial difficulties along with a controversial takeover by Rangers, did not help matters. They would survive until the end of the NSL, but fold thereafter. Parramatta Power failed to gather much support, placed as it was in the midst of the already crowded western Sydney soccer market, and it too would not last beyond the end of the NSL. Perth Glory became the most successful of the new mainstream entrants. High crowds and good performances throughout the NSL&#x27;s last decade made Perth Glory for many observers the benchmark and role model for all future entrants to the Australian top-flight.

A then record grand final crowd of 40,000 people saw the Brisbane Strikers become the first Queensland side to win the title in season 1996/97, but it never resulted in Brisbane gaining much bigger crowds in the following seasons than they were accustomed to. South Melbourne FC under Ange Postecoglou won back-to-back titles in the late 1990s, and by also winning the 1999 Oceania Club Championship, earning the right to play in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, where it put in some respectable performances against sides such as Manchester United and a tidy sum in prize money. Wollongong Wolves became the only side from regional Australia to win the league, with their back-to-back titles in 1999–2000 and 2000–01. The 1999–2000 Grand Final against Perth Glory at Subiaco Oval in Perth saw a record attendance of 43,242, overtaking the 1997 figure in Brisbane and a record that would remain until the 2007 A-League Grand Final in Melbourne. The cancellation of the 2001 FIFA Club World Championship however was a major blow to the league as clubs which had seen a way of making a substantial amount of much needed money.

===2001–2004: Decline and demise===
After the 2001 FIFA Club World Championship was cancelled, the NSL was in great turmoil. High-profile Australian players began to leave the NSL due to more enticing offers from overseas leagues.

In 1998, Soccer Australia sold the television rights for the NSL and Socceroos matches to the Seven Network in a 10-year contract that was worth $2.5 million a year. Seven bought the rights to be one of the flagships of its pay TV sport channel, C7 Sport.

It also broadcast a small amount of coverage on its free-to-air network. At one point in 2000, the amount of free-to-air coverage on the NSL was only a one-hour highlights package of the NSL after midnight on Wednesdays. Many believe Channel 7 deliberately refused to air games to kill off interest in the league that was flourishing in the 90s.

In 2002, C7 Sport closed after the Seven Network lost the Australian Football League (AFL) rights and pay TV networks stopped carrying the channel. The next year, Seven severed its contract in the last week of Soccer Australia&#x27;s existence. This left the NSL with no TV coverage at all until SBS picked up the rights soon after.

The consequent lack of sponsorship meant the league fell into even further decline which led to its eventual demise at the end of the 2003–04 season. Highlights were few and far between, but Sydney Olympic re-emerged as a genuine leading club for the first time in a decade, winning its second title, and Perth Glory went on to win the last two titles of the NSL, after previously having lost two grand finals.

The birth of Adelaide United, as a quickly formed replacement of Adelaide City who withdrew just before the start of the final NSL season, was perhaps the sole major highlight of this era, as they put in good performances, but most importantly, registered crowds which had not been seen in Adelaide since the heyday of Adelaide City and West Adelaide.

The league in 2003–04 was won by Perth Glory after a 1–0 win against Parramatta Power on 4 April 2004, almost 27 years to the day that the national competition began. Nik Mrdja had the honour of scoring the last goal in the NSL, a 98th minute golden goal to seal the championship for Perth. After this, national competition went into recess for a year and a half. In November 2004, 8 teams, including 5 from the now defunct NSL, formed the A-League, the revamped national competition whilst many were denied the opportunity due to the bidding process and 1 team for 1 city rule. The first competition began on 26 August 2005, ending the long recess and killing off the NSL and its 24-year history.

==Competition format==
The competition structure changed many times throughout the NSL&#x27;s history. From its inception in 1977 until 1983, it was simply a matter of first past the post. However a compromise format was devised between the traditional first past the post and the Australian system of finals. In 1978, 1979 (two-legged Grand Final), 1980 and 1982 a finals series was conducted but the winner of the Grand Final did not determine who won the title. From 1984 until 1986, the league introduced more teams split into two conferences (1984 – Australian Conference, New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory clubs and National Conference, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland; 1985 and 1986 – Northern Conference, New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory clubs and Southern Conference for the rest) with 12 teams in each. The top five in each division would qualify for the playoffs, with the winner of each of the divisional playoffs playing off in a two-legged Grand Final. In 1987, the league dumped 11 teams, scrapped the split divisions, and the championship system reverted to first past the post.

In 1988 the league re-introduced a finals system, with the top five sides qualifying for the playoffs. In season 1992/93, the league increased the finalists to six. This system was used for the rest of the league&#x27;s duration, except for season 2002/03 when the top six sides played a further series of home and away games against each other, with the top two playing off in the Grand Final.

The NSL also used a variety of point systems throughout its history. From 1977 until season 1991/92, teams were awarded two points for a win, one point for draw, and none for a loss. The exceptions to this were 1979, in which wins by four goals or more were awarded a bonus point, and 1983, in which three points were awarded for a win. From season 1992/93 onwards three points were awarded for a win, except for season 1994/95. In that season, four points were awarded for a win, with games ending in draws, being decided by penalty shootouts at the end of the game. The winner of the shootout received two points, the loser one point.

===Related competitions===
Successful NSL clubs gained qualification into the continental competition, the Oceania Club Championship, although the competition only occurred in 1987, 1999 and 2001. In addition to the main league competition, the NSL also held a knock-out cup competition between 1977 and the 1997 season known as the NSL Cup. The NSL Cup was initially held during the regular season, before gradually becoming a pre-season warm-up tournament. Between 1984 and 2004 National Youth League ran in conjunction with the NSL as a national youth developmental and reserve league.

<text>Houayxay (, ; , ) (also &quot;Huoeisay&quot;, &quot;Huai Sai&quot;, &quot;Houei Sai&quot; or &quot;Huay Xai&quot;), is a district in Bokeo Province, Laos, on the border with Thailand. Ban Houayxay is the administrative centre of the district.

The town lies on the Mekong River opposite Chiang Khong in Thailand. The Fourth Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge at Ban Houayxay, which opened in December 2013 and replaced ferry service across the river, is now the northernmost road border crossing between the two countries. Asian Highway 3, which runs through Ban Houayxay, extends north to Yunnan Province of China and south to Chiang Rai Province of Thailand.

Houayxay has a domestic airport (HOE) with regular flights to Vientiane and Luang Prabang (depending on the season). 

The town is the starting point for many boats (speed and slow boats, freighters, luxury cruisers for tourists and others) on the Mekong River to Pakbeng, Luang Prabang and other destinations.

Houayxay is also home to the Gibbon Experience, another highlight for tourists. It is a series of ziplines and treehouses providing a unique overnight experience.

&quot;Fort Carnot&quot;, an ancient French fort in ruins, sits on a hill overlooking the town and the Mekong River.

<text>Stryfe is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most commonly in conflict with the superhero team X-Force. He is a clone of Cable from Cable&#x27;s alternate future timeline.

==Publication history==

The character was created by Louise Simonson and Rob Liefeld, and first appears in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #86 (February 1990), a cameo appearance in which his head cannot be seen. His first full appearance was in the following issue, &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #87 (March 1990). A clone of Cable, Stryfe is the main antagonist in the 1990s crossover &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, the 2009 &quot;X-Force/Cable&quot; crossover &quot;Messiah War&quot;, and the 2014 &quot;Cable &amp; X-Force/Uncanny X-Force&quot; crossover &quot;Vendetta&quot;.

Stryfe appears as the main villain of the 2018–2019 run of &quot;X-Force&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Askani appears to Cyclops and Jean Grey from the distant future after their son Nathan Summers is infected with a techno-organic virus by Apocalypse and tells the two that the child can be saved in the future. Nathan then arrives in the future to which Mother Askani clones the baby as a back up plan. The clone&#x27;s growth is greatly accelerated until he&#x27;s the same age as Nathan himself while the Askani succeed in halting the spread of the tehno-organic virus, thereby saving Nathan&#x27;s life. However, Apocalypse&#x27;s forces attack the Askani&#x27;s hiding place and steal the cloned infant. Apocalypse takes the child as his own, raising him himself and naming him &quot;Stryfe&quot;, intending to use him as a host body. Stryfe grows into a murderous, bored and lonely child only raised by Apocalypse and Ch&#x27;vayre (Apocalypse&#x27;s second in command). Years later, as Apocalypse is about to transfer his essence into Stryfe, Apocalypse discovers that he&#x27;s unfit because Stryfe is a clone and can&#x27;t house Apocalypse&#x27;s essence. The teenage Nathan and the time-traveling Scott Summers and Jean confront Apocalypse while Apocalypse&#x27;s essence to discorporate to which Ch&#x27;vayre raises Stryfe afterwards.

Stryfe grows up to be an embittered madman, wanting vengeance on both what he thought were his real parents (Cyclops and Jean) and his spiritual parent Apocalypse. He becomes an anarchist and terrorist rebel in the Nor-Am Pact region 3783–3806 in his alternate future. He raises an army and for years became a fierce opponent of both Cable and the Clan Chosen, as well as the New Canaanites, a despotic regime that replaced Apocalypse&#x27;s. Stryfe reveals to Cable much later in the present era that during this period in their life, he raped Aliya Dayspring (Cable&#x27;s wife who Stryfe had grown to desire) at one point by pretending to be Cable and so the father of Tyler Dayspring could be Stryfe and not Cable. He later kills Aliya as well as kidnapping and brainwashing Tyler.

In 3806, the New Canaanites take full control of the planet, but Stryfe manages to travel back in time two-thousand years. He forms a mutant terrorist group, the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF), alongside many powerful mutants including Tamara Kurtz. Stryfe orders his Mutant Liberation Front to capture Rusty Collins and Skids. In Japan, he fights Cable and clashes with the New Mutants who thwart his attempt to poison the water supplies of major cities. Stryfe abandons the Antarctic Mutant Liberation Front base during an invasion by X-Force (a team composed of Cable and several former New Mutants). Stryfe then has the Mutant Liberation Front free the captive mutants Hairbag and Slab, and turns them over to Mister Sinister before ordering an MLF attack on a clinic. He also confronts and defeats Kane, and eventually declares his enmity for Apocalypse. Stryfe later battles Cable who learns that Stryfe is actually his double. Stryfe sows chaos in the ranks of the X-Men, posing as Cable and shooting Professor X with an infected bullet, and taking Cyclops and Jean captive. He bests the Dark Riders and Apocalypse, making him leader of the Dark Riders. As a final insurance, Stryfe gives Mister Sinister a canister that he claims holds genetic material from two-thousand years worth of the Summers bloodline; in truth, it holds the deadly Legacy Virus. Stryfe battles Cable until the latter opens a temporal rift by detonating a self-destruct system, destroying his body. Stryfe&#x27;s consciousness enters Cable&#x27;s mind, in which he stays until he voluntarily leaves.

While physically dead, Stryfe attempts to return to life through the body of Warpath. However, his attempt is avoided by the arrival of X-Force and Warpath is sent back to the living by Blackheart.

By unknown means, Stryfe revives and attempts to subjugate Latveria. Stryfe is opposed by Cable and Nate Grey, and at first beats them easily, even going as far as to siphon off all of Nate&#x27;s power. Madelyne Pryor appears to join forces with Stryfe, but secretly steals the psionic energy from Stryfe and gives it back to Nate. Madelyne, Nate and Cable join forces to defeat Stryfe.

Stryfe reappears, controlling the activation sequence for the Prime Sentinels. He uses them to hunt down Lady Deathstrike who holds the complete codes for all the Sentinels via cybernetic systems. Lady Deathstrike is forced to turn to the X-Men, and together they defeat Stryfe who teleports away.

Stryfe later experiences a personal existential crisis and becomes depressed at the futility of his efforts over the years after the X-Men finally manage to cure the Legacy Virus, which Stryfe considered to be his life&#x27;s work and the one permanent victory he had against Cable, his parents (Scott and Jean), and the rest of the X-Men. He hunts down Bishop who is possessed by the entity Le Bete Noir, whose power rivals the Phoenix Force and threatens to consume Bishop&#x27;s body and unleash its evil upon the universe. However, Stryfe ultimately regrets the path he took and the choices he has made in his life (stemming from his perpetual identity crisis as a clone), frees Bishop from the entity and sacrifices himself to save the Earth by absorbing Le Bete Noir into himself, shattering his body from the power overload. Gambit, however, is suspicious that Cable may have telepathically forced Stryfe to sacrifice himself.

===Messiah War===
It&#x27;s revealed during &quot;Messiah War&quot; that Stryfe was able to transport himself into the future instead of dying where he is discovered by Bishop, who has been traveling through time in an attempt to kill Hope Summers. This was confirmed by the writer Christopher Yost to be the same character that had previously plagued the X-Men, mentioning in particular his survival of his fight against Nate and Cable. Bishop propositioned a chance to kill Apocalypse, if Stryfe aided him in killing Cable who Stryfe said he no longer cared about. After Bishop initiated a global catastrophe that wiped out most of the people on Earth, Stryfe was able to step in and fill the leadership void. Together, Stryfe and Bishop traveled to 2963 A.D., where their combined efforts attacked Apocalypse while the latter slept in a rejuvenation chamber and defeated, assuming they killed Apocalypse. Stryfe stole the Celestial Ship and technology and used it to raise an army that gave him total control over the people, save for a small rebellion. Stryfe tyrannically ruled over his subjects, the Stryfetroopers, with Bishop as his right-hand-man for nearly a decade. Stryfe placed the Ship in Westchester County, New York and renamed the city, New Celestial City. Shortly after building his empire, Stryfe employed Deadpool as security and imprisoned Kiden Nixon who was used to create a chronal net, preventing anyone from jumping out of the timeline. But when Stryfe was reminded by Wolverine that he already &quot;died a hero&quot; to just be a villain again, Stryfe claims to not know what Wolverine is talking about. Cable, Deadpool, the time-displaced X-Force and Apocalypse join forces to defeat Stryfe and Bishop. Cable and Hope travel further into the future, the X-Force return to the present, and Apocalypse drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body.

===Vendetta===
Stryfe is able to prevent Apocalypse from using his body as a new host and travels back in time to the present in the &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot; and &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; crossover &quot;Vendetta&quot;. Upon discovering that Bishop has returned to the present, Hope tries to kill him in an act of vengeance. Stryfe appears and kidnaps both and brings the two to an old, abandoned Mutant Liberation Force base. There, he attempts to manipulate Hope into killing Bishop who has come to realize the error of various past mistakes. Stryfe explains to Bishop how he wants him to suffer after he betrayed him during Messiah War and claims that he was imprisoned and tortured by Apocalypse for years until he planned a successful escape and killed him. Stryfe tries to corrupt Hope by making her give in to her feelings of hatred towards Bishop, convincing her to take revenge and murder Bishop, although he is shackled and refuses to fight back out of remorse. Cable and both teams of X-Force soon intervene and combat Stryfe. Hope sees that Stryfe is trying to undo the lessons which Cable taught and refuses to kill Bishop, but Hope severely injures him. Stryfe is defeated by Cable and both X-Force teams, but before escaping, he telepathically forces Hope to mimic his vast and nearly uncontrollable psionic power with the intention that Hope will destroy her own friends. Bishop helps Hope to disperse Stryfe&#x27;s massive energy and the two come to an uneasy truce.

==Powers and abilities==
Stryfe is a clone of the mutant Cable and, as a result, possesses Cable&#x27;s abilities of telepathy and telekinesis. However, these abilities are far more powerful than the ones Cable has generally displayed, sufficient to block the use of Cyclops and Jean Grey&#x27;s superhuman powers. This is because Stryfe was never infected with Apocalypse&#x27;s techno-organic virus like Cable was. Therefore, he does not have to constantly expend his abilities to keep the virus from consuming his body, which apparently was a huge drain on Cable&#x27;s capabilities. Stryfe can use his psionic abilities in a variety of ways such as moving large objects with his mind, reading minds, mind control, telepathically negating and activating the use of other&#x27;s powers, telepathic camouflage, telekinetic flight, telekinetic force fields, mind transference and telekinetic blasts. Stryfe also has far more control over his massive psionic abilities than Cable or Nate Grey, apparently from having a whole lifetime of experience of learning how to use his powers which his alternate counterparts never had. Stryfe also possessed other abilities through genetic manipulation similar to those that Cable achieved through cybernetic augmentation, including superhuman strength and durability.

Stryfe wears battle armor that is highly impervious to damage. He has used various advanced weaponry and technology from the 39th century of his alternate future.

==Reception==
* In 2017, &quot;WhatCulture&quot; ranked Stryfe 3rd in their &quot;10 Most Evil X-Men Villains&quot; list.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, Ultimate Stryfe is also the leader of the Mutant Liberation Front. He appears to be a mutant supremacist convinced that Professor X was killed by the United States government and that mutants should fight against the government. His mutant power manifests as the ability to cause &quot;strife&quot; within people&#x27;s minds, causing them to voice whatever is bothering them. However, when Psylocke scans his mind she senses that he has no real conviction in what he says, suggesting that much of his mutant supremacist attitude is an act, meaning his real motives are unknown. At his side is the ultimate version of Zero, a young mutant teleporter. It is revealed that Stryfe is actually a con man, working with Fenris to promote mutant unrest so they can sell Sentinels to the government.

In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, when Cable returns from the future with Xavier they both don armor; Xavier&#x27;s resembling Onslaught and Cable&#x27;s resembling the mainstream Stryfe.

===Deadpool Pulp===
In the &quot;Deadpool Pulp&quot; timeline, a General Stryfe is introduced. Stryfe is a younger, corrupt General who, alongside Cable and J. Edgar Hoover, hires Wade Wilson (who in this timeline is a former CIA man turned mercenary) to get back a stolen nuclear briefcase. Stryfe is later killed by Deadpool.

<doc id="529813" wikidata="Q528340" url="?curid=529813" title="Vaughn Monroe">
<text>Vaughn Wilton Monroe (October 7, 1911 – May 21, 1973) was an American baritone singer, trumpeter and big band leader who was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for recording and another for radio performance.

==Early life==
Monroe was born in Akron, Ohio. He graduated from Jeannette High School in Pennsylvania in 1929.

==Career==
Monroe formed his first orchestra in Boston in 1940 and became its principal vocalist. He began recording for RCA Victor&#x27;s subsidiary label, Bluebird. That same year, Monroe built &quot;The Meadows&quot;, a restaurant and nightclub to the west of Boston on Massachusetts Route 9 in Framingham, Massachusetts. After he ceased performing, he continued running the club until his death in 1973.

The summer of 1942 brought a 13-week engagement on radio, as Monroe and his orchestra had a summer replacement program for &quot;Blondie&quot; on CBS.

Monroe hosted the &quot;Camel Caravan&quot; radio program from The Meadows, starting in 1946 and, during this time, was featured in a Camel cigarettes commercial. In 1952, Monroe and his orchestra had a weekly program on Saturday nights on NBC radio. Those programs originated on location from wherever the band happened to be touring. Each program featured a focus on a college in the United States.

Monroe was tall and handsome, which helped him as a band leader and singer, as well as in Hollywood. He was sometimes called &quot;the Baritone with Muscles&quot;, &quot;the Voice with Hair on its Chest&quot;, and &quot;Ol&#x27; Leather Tonsils&quot;.

Monroe recorded extensively for RCA Victor until 1956, and his signature tune was &quot;Racing With the Moon&quot; (1941). It sold more than one million copies by 1952, becoming Monroe&#x27;s first million-seller, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Among his other hits were &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; (1939), &quot;There I Go&quot; (1941), &quot;There I&#x27;ve Said It Again&quot; (1945), &quot;Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow&quot; (1946), &quot;Ballerina&quot; (1947), &quot;Melody Time&quot; (1948), &quot;Riders in the Sky&quot; (1949), &quot;Someday (You&#x27;ll Want Me To Want You)&quot; (1949), &quot;Sound Off&quot; (1951), and &quot;In the Middle of the House&quot; (1956). He also turned down the chance to record &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.

Monroe&#x27;s orchestra had a number of excellent musicians including future jazz guitar great Bucky Pizzarelli. While their musical focus was largely romantic ballads, in person, the band had a fiercely swinging side only occasionally captured on record. In ballrooms, Monroe often reserved the final set of the evening for unrestrained, swinging music.

Hollywood also beckoned, although Monroe did not pursue acting with much vigor. He appeared in &quot;Meet the People&quot; (1944), &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot; (1947), &quot;Singing Guns&quot; (1950), and &quot;Toughest Man in Arizona&quot; (1952). He co-authored &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Putt Putt&quot; (1949), a children&#x27;s book about airplanes and flying, a personal interest of his. 

He hosted &quot;The Vaughn Monroe Show&quot; on CBS Television (1950–51, 1954–55) and appeared on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. Monroe was a major RCA stockholder and appeared in print ads and television commercials for the company&#x27;s television and audio products.

After leaving the performing end of show business, Monroe remained with RCA for many years as a television spokesperson, executive, and talent scout. In the latter capacity, he helped give Neil Sedaka, among others, his first major exposure. He was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for recording at 1600 Vine Street and one for radio at 1755 Vine Street in Hollywood, California.

==Personal life==
Monroe married Marian Baughman on April 2, 1940, in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, where they had met as high school students. They did not date during high school, but became romantically inclined toward each other when their paths crossed again in New York City, years after graduation. They returned to Jeannette for their wedding. They had two children, Candace and Christina. They remained married until Vaughn&#x27;s death in 1973.

An avid railroad enthusiast, Monroe collected and built HO scale model trains. On concert tours he had an elaborate and compact workshop that folded neatly into a valise. Inside were hundreds of intricate tools to build operating miniature locomotives, passenger and freight cars.

==Death==
Monroe died on May 21, 1973, at Martin County Memorial Hospital in Florida, shortly after having stomach surgery for a bleeding ulcer.

<doc id="529817" wikidata="Q912644" url="?curid=529817" title="Punnett square">
<text>The Punnett square is a square diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is named after Reginald C. Punnett, who devised the approach in 1905. The diagram is used by biologists to determine the probability of an offspring having a particular genotype. The Punnett square is a tabular summary of possible combinations of maternal alleles with paternal alleles. These tables can be used to examine the genotypical outcome probabilities of the offspring of a single trait (allele), or when crossing multiple traits from the parents.

The Punnett square is a visual representation of Mendelian inheritance, a fundamental concept in genetics discovered by Gregor Mendel. For multiple traits, using the &quot;forked-line method&quot; is typically much easier than the Punnett square. Phenotypes may be predicted with at least better-than-chance accuracy using a Punnett square, but the phenotype that may appear in the presence of a given genotype can in some instances be influenced by many other factors, as when polygenic inheritance and/or epigenetics are at work.

==Zygosity==

Zygosity refers to the grade of similarity between the alleles that determine one specific trait in an organism. In its simplest form, a pair of alleles can be either homozygous or heterozygous. Homozygosity, with &quot;homo&quot; relating to &quot;same&quot; while &quot;zygous&quot; pertains to a zygote, is seen when a combination of either two dominant or two recessive alleles code for the same trait. Recessive are always lowercase letters. For example, using &#x27;A&#x27; as the representative character for each allele, a homozygous dominant pair&#x27;s genotype would be depicted as &#x27;AA&#x27;, while homozygous recessive is shown as &#x27;aa&#x27;. Heterozygosity, with &quot;hetero&quot; associated with &quot;different&quot;, can only be &#x27;Aa&#x27; (the capital letter is always presented first by convention). The phenotype of a homozygous dominant pair is &#x27;A&#x27;, or dominant, while the opposite is true for homozygous recessive. Heterozygous pairs always have a dominant phenotype. To a lesser degree, hemizygosity and nullizygosity can also be seen in gene pairs.

==Monohybrid cross==

&quot;Mono-&quot; means &quot;one&quot;; this cross indicates that the examination of a single trait. This could mean (for example) eye color. Each genetic locus is always represented by two letters. So in the case of eye color, say &quot;B = Brown eyes&quot; and &quot;b = green eyes&quot;. 
In this example, both parents have the genotype &quot;Bb&quot;. For the example of eye color, this would mean they both have brown eyes. They can produce gametes that contain either the &quot;B&quot; or the &quot;b&quot; allele. (It is conventional in genetics to use capital letters to indicate dominant alleles and lower-case letters to indicate recessive alleles.) The probability of an individual offspring&#x27;s having the genotype &quot;BB&quot; is 25%, &quot;Bb&quot; is 50%, and &quot;bb&quot; is 25%. The ratio of the phenotypes is 3:1, typical for a monohybrid cross. When assessing phenotype from this, &quot;3&quot; of the offspring have &quot;Brown&quot; eyes and only one offspring has &quot;green&quot; eyes. (3 are &quot;B?&quot; and 1 is &quot;bb&quot;)

The way in which the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;b&quot; alleles interact with each other to affect the appearance of the offspring depends on how the gene products (proteins) interact (see Mendelian inheritance). This can include lethal effects and epistasis (where one allele masks another, regardless of dominant or recessive status).

==Dihybrid cross==

More complicated crosses can be made by looking at two or more genes. The Punnett square works, however, only if the genes are independent of each other, which means that having a particular allele of gene &quot;A&quot; does not alter the probability of possessing an allele of gene &quot;B&quot;. This is equivalent to stating that the genes are not linked, so that the two genes do not tend to sort together during meiosis.

The following example illustrates a dihybrid cross between two double-heterozygote pea plants. &quot;R&quot; represents the dominant allele for shape (round), while &quot;r&quot; represents the recessive allele (wrinkled). &quot;A&quot; represents the dominant allele for color (yellow), while &quot;a&quot; represents the recessive allele (green). If each plant has the genotype &quot;RrAa&quot;, and since the alleles for shape and color genes are independent, then they can produce four types of gametes with all possible combinations: &quot;RA&quot;, &quot;Ra&quot;, &quot;rA&quot;, and &quot;ra&quot;.
Since dominant traits mask recessive traits (assuming no epistasis), there are nine combinations that have the phenotype round yellow, three that are round green, three that are wrinkled yellow, and one that is wrinkled green. The ratio 9:3:3:1 is the expected outcome when crossing two double-heterozygous parents with unlinked genes. Any other ratio indicates that something else has occurred (such as lethal alleles, epistasis, linked genes, etc.).

===Forked-line method===
The forked-line method (also known as the tree method and the branching system) can also solve dihybrid and multi-hybrid crosses. A problem is converted to a series of monohybrid crosses, and the results are combined in a tree. However, a tree produces the same result as a Punnett square in less time and with more clarity. The example below assesses another double-heterozygote cross using RrYy x RrYy. As stated above, the phenotypic ratio is expected to be 9:3:3:1 if crossing unlinked genes from two double-heterozygotes. The genotypic ratio was obtained in the diagram below, this diagram will have more branches than if only analyzing for phenotypic ratio.

<text>RFA &quot;Resource&quot; was an armament stores ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom.

==Falklands War==
&quot;Resource&quot; served in the Falklands War, captained at that time by Captain Bruce Seymour. She was one of the first vessels on the scene to pick up survivors from HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;, having just supplied her.

RFA &quot;Resource&quot; was one of several RFA munitions replenishment ships certified to store and supply the fleet with munitions, including WE.177A live nuclear weapons. Other ships capable of carrying (stored in deep magazines) or deploying these weapons were , , and , they were transferred to various Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships with their specialist magazines. This was initially RFA &quot;Regent&quot;, and when RFA &quot;Resource&quot; exited San Carlos, they were transferred to her, and then to RFA &quot;Fort Austin&quot;. After the end of the conflict they were transported back to Britain aboard RFA &quot;Fort Austin&quot; and RFA &quot;Resource&quot;. Inert practice weapons and surveillance weapons without fissionable material were also transported.

==Yugoslavia==
One of &quot;Resource&quot;″s last duties before being decommissioned was to serve as a floating munitions storage for UN and IFOR troops in the former Yugoslavia. She spent much of the mid 1990s in Split, Croatia, fulfilling this role.

==Decommissioning and scrapping==
&quot;Resource&quot; sailed from Devonport on 24 June 1997, having been renamed &quot;Resourceful&quot; for the delivery run to the Indian breakers, and arrived at Alang for scrapping on 20 August 1997.

<text>A mendicant (from , &quot;begging&quot;) is one who practices mendicancy, relying chiefly or exclusively on alms to survive. In principle, mendicant religious orders own little property, either individually or collectively, and in many instances members have taken a vow of poverty, in order that all their time and energy could be expended on practicing their respective faith, preaching and serving society.

Mendicancy is a form of asceticism, especially in Western Christianity. In Eastern Christianity, some ascetics are referred to as Fools for Christ, whereby they spurn the convention of society in pursuit of living a more wholly Christian life.

==Religious practice==
Many religious orders adhere to a mendicant way of life, including the Catholic mendicant orders, Hindu ascetics, some Sufi dervishes of Islam, and the monastic orders of Jainism and Buddhism.

While mendicants are the original type of monks in Buddhism and have a long history in Indian Hinduism and the countries which adapted Indian religious traditions, they did not become widespread in Christianity until the High Middle Ages. &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot; depicts the life of an Eastern Christian mendicant.

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

In the early Latin Church, mendicants and itinerant preachers were looked down upon, and their preaching was suppressed. In the Rule of Saint Benedict, Benedict of Nursia referred to such traveling monks as gyrovagues, and accused them of dangerously indulging their wills. This behavior was compared negatively with the stationary nature of cenobite or anchorite monasticism.

In the early 13th century, the Catholic Church would see a revival of mendicant activity, as followers of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Dominic begged for food while they preached to the villages. These men came to found a Catholic form of monastic life referred to as mendicant orders. These orders were in stark contrast to more powerful, and more conservative, monastic orders such as the Benedictines and Cistercians.

Itinerant preachers that belonged to mendicant orders traveled from town to town to preach the Gospel, consciously modeling themselves after Jesus and the Twelve Disciples. Professor Giacomo Todeschini at the University of Trieste has described these mendicants in the following way:

===Other Christians===

Unlike Western Christians, Eastern Christians never created a form of monasticism equivalent to mendicant orders. Rather, all Orthodox monks and nuns follow the more traditionally monastic Rule of Saint Basil. Mendicancy does, however, still find root through lay expressions of Foolishness for Christ.

Despite the abandoning of ascetic practice within Protestantism, mendicant-style preaching has still come about independently of it. American Methodists were once known for sending out itinerant preachers known as circuit riders. Another example was Johnny Appleseed, a Swedenborgian itinerant preacher who would eventually rise to the status of American folk hero.

==Buddhism==
Buddhism is one of several religious traditions of ancient India that has an established practice of mendicancy. Monks of the Theravada traditions in Southeast Asia continue to practice alms round (Sanskrit and Pali: &quot;piṇḍapāta&quot;) as laid down by the Buddha. Food is procured from the faithful and divided equally among all members of the Sangha.

A major difference between Buddhist and Christian mendicancy is the understanding of manual labor as a means of support. While many Buddhist communities formulated limited forms of labor for monks, there also exists the understanding that a Buddhist monk must remain aloof from secular affairs. Many of these rules of decorum and acceptable livelihood are preserved in the Vinaya literature of several schools. The Sangha&#x27;s immersion into the work of laymen and laywomen is also believed to be a sign of impending calamity.

===Theravada===
Buddhist code of monastic discipline details the code of behavior and livelihood for monks and nuns, including several details on how mendicancy is to be practiced. Traditionally, mendicants relied on what have been termed the &quot;four requisites&quot; for survival: food, clothing, lodging, and medicine. As stated in the Theravada Vinaya:

&quot;Properly considering the robe, I use it: simply to ward off cold, to ward off heat, to ward off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame.

&quot;Properly considering almsfood, I use it: not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on weight, nor for beautification; but simply for the survival and continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the chaste life, (thinking) I will destroy old feelings (of hunger) and not create new feelings (from overeating). Thus I will maintain myself, be blameless, and live in comfort.

&quot;Properly considering the lodging, I use it: simply to ward off cold, to prevent sunburn, to ward off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun and reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion.

&quot;Properly considering medicinal requisites for curing the sick, I use them: simply to ward off any pains of illness that have arisen and for the maximum freedom from disease.&quot;
In addition, a monk&#x27;s personal property was also limited. The Theravada tradition recognizes eight requisites ():
#Uttarāsaṅga (outer robe)
#Antarvāsa (inner robe)
#Saṃghāti (double robe)
#an alms bowl
#a razor for shaving
#a needle and thread
#a belt
#a water strainer

Commentarial literature provides additional possessions based on circumstance.

===Japanese Buddhism===
Similar to the development of Buddhism in China, the Japanese did not frequently engage in alms round as was done in the Buddha&#x27;s time. Monasteries would receive donations of land that were worked by peasant farmers which provided regular communal meals for residing monks.

Nevertheless, piṇḍapāta is occasionally practiced in Japan, primarily within Zen Buddhism. Monks who engage in alms round tend to wear a bamboo hat, white leggings and straw sandals as traditionally worn by itinerant monks (). When going for alms in groups, the monks will form a line and wander through the town shouting the phrase &quot;hōu&quot; () to announce their presence.

==Islam==

Among Muslims, especially in Northern Nigeria, there are mendicants called Almajiri who are mostly children between the age of 5 to 18 years that are studying Qur&#x27;an in cities while begging to get sustenance. In addition to almajiri, Northern Nigeria, which is a predominantly Muslim region, has many beggars that may not necessarily be Almajiri. This includes people with physical disabilities such as the blind and even aged destitutes.

<text>HMPNGS &quot;Salamaua&quot; is a heavy landing craft operated by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF). Prior to 1974, the vessel was called HMAS &quot;Salamaua&quot; (L 131) and was operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The eight-vessel &quot;Balikpapan&quot; class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army&#x27;s LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft. They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of . The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach . The standard ship&#x27;s company is 13-strong. The &quot;Balikpapan&quot;s are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two machine guns for self-defence.

The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armored personnel carriers 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a &quot;Balikpapan&quot;-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel&#x27;s payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages.

&quot;Salamaua&quot; was laid down Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 29 May 1972, launched on 27 July 1972, and commissioned into the RAN on 19 October 1973.

==Operational history==
&quot;Salamaua&quot; was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force on 14 November 1974. She was in active service as of 2013. She was retired on June 19, 2020.

<doc id="529838" wikidata="Q6113095" url="?curid=529838" title="The House of the Dead (video game)">
<text>is a 1996 horror-themed light-gun shooter arcade game developed by Sega AM1 and released by Sega. It is the first game in the &quot;House of the Dead&quot; series. Players assume the role of agents Thomas Rogan and &quot;G&quot; as they combat an army of undead experiments created by Dr. Curien, a mad scientist.

The game was developed for over a year on the Sega Model 2 arcade hardware. Targeting an adult audience, AM1 devised a story and atmosphere inspired by Western horror films. AM1&#x27;s plans for detailed environments, non-linear level designs, and a gory aesthetic were challenged – and often limited – by the Model 2 hardware and other factors.

&quot;The House of the Dead&quot; was well-received by critics. It has been, along with &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, credited with popularising zombie video games, as well as re-popularising zombies in wider popular culture from the late 1990s onwards, leading to renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s.

A remake of the game was developed by MegaPixel Studio and published by Forever Entertainment for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One in April 2022, for Xbox Series X/S in September 2022, and for PlayStation 5 in January 2023.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The House of the Dead&quot; is a rail shooter light gun game. Players use a light gun (or mouse, in the PC version) to aim and shoot at approaching zombies. The characters&#x27; pistols use magazines which hold 6 rounds; players reload by shooting away from the screen. When a player sustains damage or shoots a civilian, one point of health is removed. The continue screen appears when all health is lost. If the player runs out of continues, the game is over. First-aid packs are available throughout the game which restore one point of health; some can be obtained from rescued hostages, while others are hidden inside certain breakable objects. Special items can be found within other breakables, granting a bonus to the player who shoots them. The player can earn additional health at the end of each level based on the number of hostages rescued.

Throughout the course of the game, players are faced with numerous situations in which their action (or inaction) will have an effect on the direction of gameplay. This is exemplified in the opening stage of the game when a hostage is about to be thrown from the bridge to his death. If the player saves the hostage, they will enter the house directly through the front door; however, if the player fails to rescue the hostage, the character is redirected to an underground route through the sewers.

Players can score additional points by shooting enemies in the head, rescuing hostages and finding hidden items.

== Plot ==
In Europe, the renowned biochemist and geneticist, Dr. Roy Curien, becomes obsessed with discovering the nature of life and death. While supported by the DBR Corporation and its own team of scientists, Curien&#x27;s behavior becomes more erratic and his experiments take an inhumane and gruesome turn. The Curien Mansion, which serves as his home and laboratory, experiences an outbreak of undead zombies. 

On December 18, 1998, AMS Agent Thomas Rogan receives a distress call from his fiancée, Sophie Richards, from the Curien Mansion. Rogan and his partner, &quot;G&quot;, fly to Europe and arrive at the estate, finding it overrun with undead creatures, which Curien unleashed and the scientists there held as hostages by the zombies. A mortally wounded scientist gives them a journal containing information about Curien&#x27;s creations and their weaknesses, and urges them to rescue the survivors still trapped inside. 

Rogan and G reach Sophie, only to witness her being carried away by a flying gargoyle-like monster called the Hangedman. The two enter the house, and later find Sophie, just before she is attacked by the Chariot, a hulking, heavily-armored mutant armed with a bardiche. After killing the mutant, Rogan and G attend to a wounded Sophie, who warns them that they must stop Curien at all costs, before collapsing from her wounds. Furious, Rogan and G push further into the mansion, and upon reaching the rooftops encounter the Hangedman. In the ensuing battle, Rogan and G are nearly thrown to their deaths, but still manage to shoot it down. Fighting deeper into the mansion’s laboratories, the two eventually find Curien, who is protected by a massive, arachnoid creature called the Hermit. After killing it, Rogan and G continue their chase.

The duo traverse through several laboratories housed in a mountain cave system beneath the manor, arriving at a massive laboratory where Curien unleashes his masterpiece, the Magician, a powerful humanoid creature with pyrokinetic abilities. However, the Magician refuses to serve any master and kills Curien. To prevent it from escaping, Rogan and G fight the Magician, and after being defeated, the Magician explodes, but not before warning the players that they &quot;have not seen anything yet&quot;. With both Curien and the Magician dead, the agents leave the mansion.

===Endings===
There are three different endings; which one players see is determined by their score rank. In what the developers called the &quot;normal ending&quot;, Sophie is reanimated and becomes a zombie. What the developers have referred to as the &quot;true ending&quot; is only seen if the players get the highest rank: Sophie is alive, having survived her injuries. In the third ending, a far view of the mansion is shown and Sophie is absent (leaving it unknown if she survived or not).

==Development and release==
Development started in December 1995 and took one year and three months. None of the development team could speak English, so they arrived at the name &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; by taking various horror-themed phrases in Japanese and picking the one where the English translated text had the most &quot;cool&quot; visual, without concern for what sort of connotations the phrase might have to English speakers. The team saw people in their 20s and 30s as their target audience, and hoped that the game would primarily be experienced as a two-player game.

&quot;The House of the Dead&quot; was built on the &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; game engine. The developers wanted to have a more complex system of path branches, and to have the system impact the game&#x27;s story, but eventually realized these ideas were too ambitious to fulfill within the time allotted to make the game.

The enemy designs were drafted quickly, going from idea directly to design drawing without any rough sketches. Anticipating that foreign markets, particularly Germany, would require the violence be toned down, they built in an option for operators to change the color of the game&#x27;s blood, with green, purple, and blue available in addition to the traditional red. They also cut a female zombie from the game because they felt she looked too much like a normal elderly woman, which could provoke controversy given that the player is encouraged to shoot the zombies. The Chariot was animated by using motion capture with an actor wielding a broom, but the other enemies were all animated manually, using motion capture for reference only.

Sega AM4 designed the game&#x27;s cabinet using screenshots and illustrations given to them by AM1. &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; came in two cabinet formats, both upright: one with a 50-inch monitor and one with a 29-inch monitor.

===Ports===
In late 1997, Sega confirmed that work had begun on a port to Sega Saturn, as an early version had been delivered to them. The port was handled by Tantalus Interactive and released in 1998, with a port to Windows (PC-CD) by Sega arriving the same year. Extra game modes were added to both ports, which include selectable characters with different weapons and a boss rush mode. The Saturn port supports the console&#x27;s light gun peripherals.

Both the Sega Saturn and PC editions have slightly remixed soundtracks. On Chapter 2, there is a reference to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the words &quot;Challenger, go at throttle up&quot;, spoken by Richard O. Covey from the mission control room only seconds before the explosion, can be heard three times before the music loops. These words do not appear in the arcade version; a snickering laugh is heard instead. The title, and boss themes are reversed on the PC port as well.

A version for mobile phones was released in Japan, and aimed to recreate the gameplay and locations from the arcade version. The pre-installed trial version containing the game&#x27;s first chapter was included with Vodafone V603SH in February 2005, and utilized the phone&#x27;s accelerometer functionality to control the camera.

==Remake==
In April 2021, it was announced that a remake of the game was to be released for the Nintendo Switch. &quot;The House of the Dead: Remake&quot; was developed by MegaPixel Studio and published by Forever Entertainment under license from Sega. In January 2022 news outlets reported that the game was expected to launch in March 2022, but it was ultimately released on April 7, 2022. Ports for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One were released on April 28, 2022, followed by Xbox Series X/S on September 23, 2022, and PlayStation 5 on January 20, 2023.

The remake uses an analog controlled crosshair for aiming by default. The Switch version also includes an alternative control scheme by utilizing the controller’s built in “gyro aiming” system to emulate the use of a light gun, and the subsequent Xbox One and PS4 ports also have alternate control methods, such as USB mouse control and the PlayStation Move/Aim controllers respectively.

==Reception and legacy==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; on their May 1, 1997, issue as being the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the month. The arcade game was also a major hit overseas. It went on to be the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1998 in Japan. By 1998, it had sold 8,600 arcade cabinets worldwide, including 1,600 in Japan and 7,000 overseas.

===Reviews===
The 1996 arcade version of &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; received positive reviews upon release. In July 1997 &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine called it &quot;the best shooting game ever!&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Overall, this is an excellent take on the light-gun genre - a sheer bloody scream.&quot; The review praised the branching levels, story, creature design, graphics, and destructible environments. In a retrospective review, &quot;AllGame&quot; awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, likewise praising the story, graphics, and destructible environments, but particularly focused on the game&#x27;s intelligent challenge. The reviewer dubbed it &quot;one of the best shooting games to hit arcades in the late 1990s.&quot;

The Saturn version of &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; garnered generally favorable reviews. It had a 71% rating on review aggregation website GameRankings based on five online reviews.

The Nintendo Switch remake received mixed reviews. &quot;Starburst&quot; praised the new soundtrack, added game modes, and the exciting atmosphere. They concluded that the remake is &quot;a fantastic revival of an old favourite&quot;. &quot;Gaming Bible&quot; similarly commented that the graphical upgrades and extras are appealing. &quot;Nook Gaming&quot; was laudatory of the game&#x27;s &quot;clever camera angles and situations&quot; that encourage efficient play. Reviewers criticized the gyro and thumbstick controls. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; felt that unlike the Wii, the Switch is unsuitable for light gun games due to its lack of a sensor bar, without which the gyro controls cause the cursor to twitch when firing. They concluded that while the gameplay still held up and the graphical upgrades and extras were reasonably well done, those who are not fans of the original game might not have the patience for it.

In a review of &quot;The House of the Dead Remake&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Sue Granquist said &quot;Though the Nintendo Switch has a pretty slick, updated gun option as a game controller, and the PS5 boasts a new &#x27;dualsense&#x27; haptics controller, I&#x27;m still not sure I&#x27;m ready to give up my OG guns for blasting away at the undead. Unfortunately, I am unlikely to be able to pass up playing an updated version.&quot;

===Cultural impact===
According to Kim Newman in the book &quot;Nightmare Movies&quot; (2011), the &quot;zombie revival began in the Far East&quot; during the late 1990s with the Japanese zombie games &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;. The success of these two 1996 zombie games inspired a wave of Asian zombie films, such as &quot;Bio Zombie&quot; (1998) and &quot;Versus&quot; (2000). The zombie revival later went global following the worldwide success of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, which inspired a wave of Western zombie films during the 2000s, such as &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002) and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004). In 2013, George A. Romero said it was the video games &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;House of the Dead&quot; &quot;more than anything else&quot; that popularised his zombie concept in early 21st-century popular culture.

<doc id="529842" wikidata="Q1522746" url="?curid=529842" title="HIARCS">
<text>HIARCS is a proprietary UCI chess engine developed by Mark Uniacke. Its name is an acronym standing for &quot;higher intelligence auto-response chess system&quot;. Because Hiarcs is written portable in C, it is available on multiple platforms such as Pocket PC, Palm OS, PDAs, iOS, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

HIARCS opening book authors over time were Eric Hallsworth, Sebastian Böhme and Harvey Williamson, who is also operating HIARCS regularly at various computer chess tournaments. HIARCS author Mark Uniacke said in a 2011 video interview that one of his current priorities in development is improving HIARCS to play in a more &quot;human-like fashion&quot; at different Elo strengths.

==History==
The first version of HIARCS was written in 1980 in PDP-11 Basic, when Mark Uniacke was only 15 years old. Subsequent versions were also written in interpreted Basic, which meant that the program was rather slow. To compensate for this, Mark developed some heuristics to guide the program&#x27;s search and evaluation in a more &#x27;targeted&#x27; way. This resulted in a program that relied on positional algorithms, rather than search depth.

At the end of the 80s, HIARCS was rewritten in C, and soon competed in computer chess tournaments. In 1991, Hiarcs went commercial and Hiarcs 1.0 was released for PCs and the MS-DOS operating system. In 1996, Hiarcs 4.0 became the first version to be marketed by Chessbase sold inside the Fritz GUI.

Version 11, the first version to support multiprocessing, was released in December 2006. HIARCS 12.1 and 13 are the engines in Pocket Fritz by Chessbase. Since Version 14, released in August 2012, HIARCS has been sold along with its own GUI (Chess Explorer) available on Mac OS X and Windows.

==Competition results==

HIARCS has won numerous computer and human tournaments. In 1991, it won the title of the &quot;World Amateur Microcomputer Chess Champion&quot; at the 11th World Microcomputer Chess Championship (WMCCC), in 1992, it won the gold medal at the 4th Computer Olympiad, and in 1993, it won the &quot;World Microcomputer Chess Championship&quot; held in Munich.

In April 1997, HIARCS 6.0 became the first PC chess program to win a match played at tournament time controls over a FIDE International Master. In the same year, HIARCS went on to win the Godesberg Open ahead of Grandmasters and International Masters.

In January 2003, HIARCS played a four-game match against Grandmaster Evgeny Bareev, world number 8 at the time. All the four games were drawn, resulting in a tied match.

Since 2005, HIARCS has been tested to be the strongest chess program available on a handheld device. It is the top handheld on the SSDF rating list, and was considered the strongest engine in a comprehensive review of 63 handheld chess programs.

In December 2007, HIARCS won the 17th International Paderborn Computer Chess Championship, and after the disqualification of Rybka, HIARCS was placed first at the 2008 World Computer Chess Championship. It also won the 2009 International CSVN Tournament, and the World Chess Software Championship in 2011 and 2013.

Pocket Fritz 4 (which uses the HIARCS chess engine) won the Copa Mercosur (a category 6 tournament) in Buenos Aires, Argentina with 9 wins and 1 draw on August 4–14, 2009, achieving a performance rating of 2898 while running on the HTC Touch HD mobile phone. It searched around 20,000 nodes per second, far less than it would on an average home computer.

==Notable games==
* HIARCS vs Viswanathan Anand, AEGON Simul, The Hague NED 1997 · Sicilian Defense: Dragon. Classical Variation General (B72) · ½–½ HIARCS plays in a simultaneous exhibition, amongst other chess engines, against Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand.
* Zappa vs HIARCS, CCT9 2007 · Sicilian Defense: Najdorf Variation. Poisoned Pawn Accepted (B97) · 0–1 Zappa traps HIARCS&#x27;s queen but ends up losing.
* HIARCS vs Jonny 17th World Computer Chess Championship (2009) · Sicilian Defense: Scheveningen Variation. English Attack (B80) 1–0 HIARCS sacrifices a piece for positional gain.

<doc id="529844" wikidata="Q2620972" url="?curid=529844" title="Story arc">
<text>A story arc (also narrative arc) is the chronological construction of a plot in a novel or story. It can also mean an extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television, comic books, comic strips, board games, video games, and films with each episode following a dramatic arc. On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is common in sitcoms, and even more so in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act structure. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most webcomics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, one of the first appearances of the term was in 1973 by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; for a synopsis of the movie &quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot;: &quot;He accomplishes this with no sacrifice to the pacing of his action sequences or the suspenseful development of his story&#x27;s arc.&quot;

Many American comic book series are now written in four- or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as trade paperbacks for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending continuity that once characterized US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC &quot;Superman&quot; comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place. Thus, storylines repeat over time in a loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another, in other words, to effect change. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a tragic fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of character is that of the &quot;hero&#x27;s journey&quot;, as laid out in Joseph Campbell&#x27;s theory of the monomyth in his work, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;. Christopher Vogler&#x27;s &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers&quot; details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Many renowned novelists and writers claim to use a story arc to create characters, stories, and even curricula. Several have published their use of the story arc to create memorable tomes in record time.

==In television and radio==

Story arcs on television and radio have existed for decades. They are common in many countries where multi-episode story lines are the norm (for example the UK&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), as well as most anime series. One notable example, from the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;, is the 1946 NBC Radio Summer-run docudrama serial &quot;The Fifth Horseman&quot;, which featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full &quot;future&quot; decades) surrounding a fictitious nuclear holocaust.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as &quot;V&quot;, were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional syndication. However, the rise of DVD box sets of complete seasons, as well as streaming, has worked in arc-based productions&#x27; favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as &quot;soap operas&quot; when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs, such as &quot;villain of the week&quot; episodes) are sometimes dismissed as filler by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
Manga and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;Gin Tama&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; and &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;. The anime &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; adapts four different story arcs from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

<text>Sir William Lamond Allardyce, (14 November 1861 – 9 June 1930) was a career British civil servant in the Colonial Office who served as governor of Fiji (1901–1902), the Falkland Islands (1904–1914), Bahamas (1914–1920), Tasmania (1920–1922), and Newfoundland (1922–1928).

==Biography==
Allardyce was born near Bombay, India, the son of Georgina Dickson Abbott and Colonel James Allardyce. Educated in Aberdeen, Scotland and at Oxford Military College, at the age of 18, he joined the British Civil Service in the Colonial Office. His brother Kenneth was also a colonial administrator, serving as Secretary for Native Affairs in Fiji.

Allardyce first posting was Fiji, where, just two years after his arrival, he was named acting Resident Commissioner for the island of Rotuma. The following year as magistrate and seven years later he was appointed to the Native Regulation Board and made the commissioner of the Supreme Court. In 1894, he was made Commissioner for Native Lands and given a seat in the Legislative Council. In 1895, he was appointed Native Commissioner, the chief liaison between the Fijian natives and the British. The following year he was appointed Receiver-General. He subsequently became Colonial Secretary and a member of the Executive Council in 1898.

In 1904, Allardyce was appointed as Governor of the Falkland Islands. After ten years at the Falklands, he was then transferred to the Bahamas to become its governor, a position he held for six years. Allardyce then became governor of Tasmania but retired after only two years—taking the last three months as leave—as a result of his failure to obtain an increase in his salary of £2750. In fact, a statement made to the Parliament of Tasmania on his salary and allowances was followed by a vote by the Legislative Assembly to abolish his office, although the same motion was defeated in the Legislative Council. Nevertheless, when he left office he was widely praised for his performance of the office.

Allardyce was subsequently ordered to Newfoundland where he was to succeed Sir Charles Alexander Harris as Governor of Newfoundland, where he was invited to become patron of the Great War Veterans Association. He was the official Crown representative of the unveiling of the National War Memorial by Field Marshal the Earl Haig on 1 July 1924. He officiated at the opening of the other national war memorial, Memorial University College, on 15 September 1925. Allardyce as governor was a key promoter in the decision awarding jurisdiction over most of the Labrador Peninsula to Newfoundland by the Privy Council.

In 1916, Allardyce was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George by King George V. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1927.

Allardyce was noted as one of the most competent administrators ever appointed by the Colonial Office to serve as the official representative of the British Crown in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Allardyce died of cancer on 9 June 1930 at Wokingham, Berkshire, England. The Allardyce Range on the island of South Georgia is named for him.

== Family ==
Allardyce married twice. First, in 1895, to Constance Angel Greene of Melbourne, Australia, daughter of Molesworth Richard Greene. She died in 1918; then, in 1920, he married Elsie Elizabeth Stewart, widow of A.C. Goodfellow. In 1923, Lady Allardyce helped start the Girl Guide movement in Newfoundland, and then in 1924, she established the Newfoundland Outport Nursing and Industrial Association (NONIA).

<doc id="529855" wikidata="Q1130386" url="?curid=529855" title="Matteuccia">
<text>Matteuccia is a genus of ferns with one species: Matteuccia struthiopteris (common names ostrich fern, fiddlehead fern, or shuttlecock fern). The species epithet &quot;struthiopteris&quot; comes from Ancient Greek words () &quot;ostrich&quot; and () &quot;fern&quot;.

==Description==
The fronds are dimorphic, with the deciduous green sterile fronds being almost vertical, tall and broad, long-tapering to the base but short-tapering to the tip, so that they resemble ostrich plumes, hence the name. The fertile fronds are shorter, long, brown when ripe, with highly modified and constricted leaf tissue curled over the sporangia; they develop in autumn, persist erect over the winter and release the spores in early spring. Along with &quot;Dryopteris goldieana&quot;, it is one of the largest species of fern in eastern North America.

==Classification==
&quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot; is the only species in the genus &quot;Matteuccia&quot;. Some sources include two Asian species, &quot;M. orientalis&quot; and &quot;M. intermedia&quot;, but molecular data shows that &quot;M. struthiopteris&quot; is more closely related to &quot;Onocleopsis&quot; and &quot;Onoclea&quot; (sensitive fern) than it is to &quot;M. orientalis&quot; and &quot;M. intermedia&quot;, and so the latter should be moved to a genus &quot;Pentarhizidium&quot; which contains those two species. Formerly classified as a member of the Dryopteridaceae, &quot;Matteuccia&quot; has been reassigned to the new much smaller family Onocleaceae.

==Distribution==

It is a crown-forming, colony-forming plant, occurring in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in central and northern Europe, northern Asia, and northern North America. It grows from a completely vertical crown, favoring riverbanks and sandbars, but sends out lateral stolons to form new crowns. It can thus form dense colonies resistant to destruction by floodwaters.

==Cultivation and uses==
The ostrich fern is a popular ornamental plant in gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. While choosing a place of planting it should be taken into account that this fern is very expansive and its leaves often lose their beauty throughout the summer, especially if not protected from wind and hail.

The tightly wound immature fronds, called fiddleheads, are also used as a cooked vegetable, and are considered a delicacy mainly in rural areas of northeastern North America. It is considered inadvisable to eat uncooked fiddleheads. Brown &quot;scales&quot; are inedible and should be scraped or rinsed off.

The sprouts are also picked all over Japan, (&quot;kogomi&quot; in Japanese) as well as in other Asian regions, where they are considered a delicacy.

Additionally, in Norway, fiddleheads were apparently used in the manufacture of beer, and in Russia, in the control of gut parasites.

&quot;Matteuccia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Sthenopis pretiosus.&quot;

Fiddlehands can be eaten raw or cooked. Collect them when 5 to 6 inches high and fronds curled. Fuzz can be removed by rubbing of the hands and wash with water. Cooking takes less than 10 minutes. 

==Fungal host==
Its base hosts the mushroom &quot;Woldmaria filiformis&quot;, which is uniquely linked with this species of fern.

<text>Archbishop Chapelle High School is a Catholic secondary school for young women located in Metairie, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States.

==History==
Archbishop Chapelle High School was founded in 1962 by the Archdiocese of New Orleans and was named after Archbishop Placide Louis Chapelle, the first Archbishop of New Orleans in the twentieth century. The Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word staffed the school. In the first year, there were 236 students with nine teachers, which included four religious and four lay teachers. An additional grade was added each year thereafter until the 1965–1966 school year, which also saw Chapelle&#x27;s first graduating class. It is also the best school by far no other school can compete. The student council came up with Chippy in 1964 and they initiated a contest among the students to help choose a mascot for the young school. Suggestions included Raiderettes, Fleur de lis, Shamrocks and Chapelle&#x27;s Belles, but Chipmunks was far and away the most popular choice.

==Academic courses==
In addition to traditional secondary school classes, Chapelle also offers include fine arts courses, drama, publications studies (including yearbook and newspaper), family and consumer studies, business courses (including computer studies and accounting), and religion. There are several foreign language courses available to students from grades 8–12, including French, Spanish, and Latin.

==Student Clubs==
Some clubs available are Ambassadors, French Club, Intramural Sports, Key Club, Matthew 25 Service Program, Mu Alpha Theta, National Art Honor Society, National Honor Society, National Junior Beta Club, National Spanish Honor Society, Student Council, and Varsity Quiz Bowl. In addition to these, there are other more specialized clubs listed on the high school&#x27;s website.

Several clubs are in coordination with Archbishop Rummel High School, an all-male Catholic secondary school also located in Metairie. Chapelle Honors Advanced band students are members of the Archbishop Rummel Band. The Chapellettes are a dance team that accompany the Rummel Band.

==Athletics==
Archbishop Chapelle athletics competes in the LHSAA.

<doc id="529857" wikidata="Q737979" url="?curid=529857" title="Eurabia conspiracy theory">
<text>&quot;Eurabia&quot; (portmanteau of Europe and Arabia) is a far-right, Islamophobic conspiracy theory that posits that globalist entities, led by French and Arab powers, aim to Islamize and Arabize Europe, thereby weakening its existing culture and undermining its previous alliances with the United States and Israel.

The theory was developed by Bat Ye&#x27;or (the pen name of Gisèle Littman) in the early 2000s and it is described in her 2005 book titled &quot;Eurabia: The Euro‐Arab Axis&quot;. Benjamin Lee of the Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats at the University of Lancaster described her work as arguing that Europe &quot;has surrendered to Islam and is in a state of submission (described as dhimmitude) in which Europe is forced to deny its own culture, stand silently by in the face of Muslim atrocities, accept Muslim immigration, and pay tribute through various types of economic assistance.&quot; According to the theory, the blame rests with a range of groups including communists, fascists, the media, universities, mosques and Islamic cultural centres, European bureaucrats, and the Euro-Arab Dialogue.

The term has gained some public interest and it has also been used and discussed by activists across a wide range of the political spectrum, including right-wing activists, self-described &quot;conservatives&quot; and counter-jihad and other anti-Islamism activists. Bat Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s &quot;mother conspiracy theory&quot; has been used as the basis for other subtheories. The narrative grew important among people who expressed anti-Islamist sentiments and it was also used by members and supporters of movements like Stop Islamisation of Europe. It gained renewed interest after the use of the term by 2011 Norway attacker, Anders Behring Breivik. Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s thesis has come under criticism by scholars, which intensified after Breivik&#x27;s crime. The conspiracy has been described as having a resemblance to the anti-Semitic &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;.

Eurabia has also been discussed by believers in classical anti-Europeanism, a strong influence on the culture of the United States as well as by believers in the notion of American exceptionalism, which sometimes sees Europe on the decline or as a rising rival power, or, as is the case here, both.

== Basic narrative ==
In &quot;Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis&quot;, Bat Ye&#x27;or says that Eurabia is the result of the Euro-Arab Dialogue, based on an allegedly French-led European policy intended to increase European power against the United States by aligning its interests with those of the Arab countries. During the 1973 oil crisis, the European Economic Community (predecessor of the European Union), had entered into the Euro-Arab Dialogue (EAD) with the Arab League. Ye&#x27;or says it was a primary cause of alleged European hostility to Israel, referring to joint Euro-Arab foreign policies that she characterises as anti-American and anti-Zionist. Ye&#x27;or purported a close connection of a Eurabia conspiracy and used the term &quot;dhimmitude&quot;, denoting alleged &quot;western subjection to Islam&quot;. The term itself is based on a newsletter published in the 1970s by the &quot;Comité européen de coordination des associations d&#x27;amitié avec le monde arabe&quot;, a Euro-Arab friendship committee.

Bat Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s &quot;Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis&quot; was the first print publication in the Eurabia genre, which has since grown to a number of titles, including Melanie Phillips&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Oriana Fallaci&#x27;s &quot;The Force of Reason&quot;, and Bruce Bawer&#x27;s &quot;While Europe Slept&quot;.
The term is often used by the writers Oriana Fallaci, Mark Steyn and several web sites, many of them affiliated with the counterjihad movement. &quot;Defeating Eurabia&quot; by Fjordman (the pen name of Peder Are Nøstvold Jensen) earned him a high standing among far-right extremists.

An important part of the narrative is the idea of a demographic threat, the fear that, at some time in the future, Islam will take over Europe. or as Bernard Lewis put it, &quot;Europe will be Islamic by the end of the century.&quot; Walter Laqueur&#x27;s &quot;The Last Days of Europe: Epitaph for An Old Continent&quot; is quoted often among the Eurabia literature.

==Impact==
=== Post-9/11 significance ===
Bat Ye&#x27;or first used the term &quot;Eurabia&quot; in 2002 and again in another 2005 book. The conservative historian Niall Ferguson referred to the concept, which he took as the potential future Islamisation of Europe based on demographic facts and ideational lack of the continent.

=== 2010s Europe ===
The idea of a Eurabian conspiracy has become a basic theme in the European extremist and populist right and expresses as well a significant strategy change. José Pedro Zúquete writes that

Muslim minority populations and Muslim immigration gained new political significance. This has led to the adoption of political positions that were previously considered fringe or third rail on either side. The main anti-Islamic theme has also penetrated into mainstream European politics, for instance in the case of Dutch populist Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders:

== Issues ==
The Eurabia concept is an Islamophobic conspiracy theory. Eurabia shortcuts the complex interaction between the US, France, Israel, the Arabic and Muslim countries on an &quot;us against them&quot; basis. The Eurabia theories are dismissed as Islamophobic, extremist and conspiracy theories in the academic community. At first academics showed little interest in the Eurabia theories due to their lack of factual basis. The theme was treated in studies of rightist extremism and Middle East politics. This changed after the 2011 Norway attacks, which resulted in the publication of several works specifically treating the Eurabia conspiracy theories.
Janne Haaland Matláry went as far as to say that &quot;it is poor use of time to analyse something so primitive&quot;.

=== Demography ===
The Pew Research Center said in 2011 that &quot;the data that we have isn&#x27;t pointing in the direction of &#x27;Eurabia&#x27; at all&quot;, and predicts that the percentage of Muslims is estimated to rise to 8% in 2030. In 2007, academics who analysed the demographics dismissed the predictions that the EU would have Muslim majorities.

Whilst it is reasonable to assume that the overall Muslim population in Europe will increase, and Muslim citizens have and will have a significant imprint on European life, its significance can be overstated. Justin Vaïsse seeks to discredit what he calls, &quot;four myths of the alarmist school&quot;, using Muslims in France as an example. Specifically he has written that the Muslim population growth rate was lower than that predicted by Eurabia, partly because the fertility rate of immigrants declines with integration. He further points out that Muslims are not a monolithic or cohesive group, and that many Muslims do seek to integrate politically and socially. Finally, he wrote that despite their numbers, Muslims have had little influence on French foreign policy.

Furthermore, leading European Muslims are rather outspoken against religious fundamentalism and are far from acknowledging Arab countries as a role model at all.

==Spread of conspiracies and further influences ==
Examples of proponents&#x27; use:

=== Europe ===
==== Germany ====
In 2010, German politician Thilo Sarrazin released &quot;Germany Abolishes Itself&quot;. The book contends that with continued Islamic immigration, Germany will become a majority Muslim nation. Journalist Simon Kuper has argued that, with over 1 million copies sold, Sarrazin had done more to publicize the concept of Eurabia than anybody else in Europe.

In political campaigning for the 2019 European Parliament election, Germany&#x27;s far-right party AfD used Jean-Léon Gérôme&#x27;s 1886 painting &quot;The Slave Market&quot; with the slogan &quot;Europeans vote AfD!&quot; and &quot;So Europe doesn&#x27;t become Eurabia!&quot;. &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; reported that the reproduction of the painting suggestively depicted dark-skinned men with beards and foreign-dress &quot;inspecting the teeth of a nude white woman&quot;.

==== Italy ====
In 2004, journalist Oriana Fallaci claimed that Muslim immigration and high fertility was part of the conspiracy theory. In 2005, Fallaci told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that &quot;Europe is no longer Europe&quot;, adding &quot;it is &#x27;Eurabia,&#x27; a colony of Islam&quot;.

In 2011, Francesco Speroni, a sitting MEP for Lega Nord, stated that he shared the same view as Anders Behring Breivik&#x27;s idea &quot;that we are going towards Eurabia&quot;. In the aftermath of the shooting, Speroni confirmed his agreement with Breivik on the conspiracy theory in an interview with Radio 24.

In 2018, Giulio Meotti used the theory in relation to the demographics of Europe, writing that &quot;Europe is over. Its future will be a mix of Eurabia and a geriatric ward.&quot;

In May 2019, ahead of the European elections, Lega Nord leader for Sarzana claimed that both the European People&#x27;s Party and the Party of European Socialists were attempting to bring about Eurabia. The day before the vote, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini endorsed the theory as a genuine threat. He insisted that a state of Eurabia had already occurred in Sweden, a claim which the Swedish embassy promptly denied with an official statement. Invoking the memory of Oriana Fallaci, he released an anti-migrant speech on Twitter, accompanied by the message &quot;No to Eurabia&quot;.

==== Netherlands ====
In 2008, journalist Arthur van Amerongen described Molenbeek as &quot;Brussels: Eurabia&quot;. Despite alleging that writer Wim van Rooy had already coined the phrase, Amerongen faced severe peer and media criticism for endorsing the conspiracy theory. After the November 2015 Paris attacks and discovery of a Brussels ISIL terror cell, photojournalist Teun Voeten agreed with Amerongen&#x27;s description, calling the municipality an &quot;ethnic and religious enclave&quot;.

Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders, who serves in the Dutch House of Representatives, has openly stated that &quot;if we do not stop Islamification now, Eurabia and Netherabia will just be a matter of time.&quot; A supporter of the conspiracy theory, Wilders believes Muslim immigration to Europe is being driven by an agreement between the European Union and Islamic countries. He has delivered speeches in the Dutch parliament about Eurabia.

==== Norway ====
In 2008, Peder Are Nøstvold Jensen, writing under his pseudonym Fjordman, published &quot;Defeating Eurabia&quot;. The book contends that one in three babies born in France are from a Muslim-background, and that there are hundreds of &quot;Muslim ghettos&quot; following Sharia law in the country, which Fjordman believes will either be overrun or face an impending civil war.

&quot;2083: A European Declaration of Independence&quot;, the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, includes a lengthy discussion of and support for the &quot;Eurabia&quot; theory. It also contains several articles on the Eurabia theme by Bat Ye&#x27;or and Fjordman. As a result, the theory received widespread mainstream media attention following the attacks. In the verdict against Breivik, the court said that &quot;many people share Breivik&#x27;s conspiracy theory, including the Eurabia theory. The court finds that very few people, however, share Breivik&#x27;s idea that the alleged &quot;Islamization&quot; should be fought with terror.&quot;

Breivik has later stated that he previously had exploited &quot;counterjihad&quot; rhetoric in order to protect &quot;ethno-nationalists&quot;, thereby instead launching a media drive against what he deemed &quot;anti-nationalist counterjihad&quot;-supporters.

==== United Kingdom ====
* The premises common to these theories are that a rapid demographic transition in Europe has been induced by &quot;European politicians and civil servants&quot;, and will lead to a Muslim majority which will have an unchanging, hostile attitude toward their host nations. Other premises, such as acquiring the compliance of or control over bureaucracies, intelligentsias and European political leaders are frequent.

=== North America ===
==== Canada ====
Author Mark Steyn, described as a &quot;champion of &#x27;Eurabia&#x27; myth&quot; by Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, has predicted an emerging Eurabia region, captured by the religion of Islam and hostile to U.S. interests. Steyn&#x27;s promotion of the conspiracy theory centres on European demographics, where he believes a culturally asserted Muslim mass will become the majority population and demand the assimilation of white Europeans.

==== United States ====
In the United States, the theories have found strong proponents in the Islamophobia movement, among them the president of Stop Islamization of America, Robert Spencer and political commentator Daniel Pipes.

In May 2006, Fox News host John Gibson called for white Americans to have more babies, referencing a decline in the &quot;native population&quot; of Europe as an apparent demographic warning for the U.S. regarding Hispanic birthrates. In what Media Matters reported as fearmongering, he claimed that Eurabia was occurring in Europe.

In his 2011–2012 run for the Republican presidential nomination, senator Rick Santorum warned that Europe was &quot;creating an opportunity for the creation of Eurabia&quot;, and that the continent was &quot;losing, because they are not having children.&quot; Classicist Bruce Thornton is also a strong advocate for the theory.

A 2007 film outline by Steve Bannon, who would later become the chief strategist for President Donald Trump and a member of the U.S. National Security Council, proposed that Muslims were trying to turn the United States into the &quot;Islamic States of America&quot;.

==Criticism==
&quot;The Economist&quot; rejected the concept of Eurabia as &quot;scaremongering&quot;. Simon Kuper in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; described Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s book as &quot;little-read but influential&quot;, and akin to &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion in reverse&quot;, adding that &quot;though ludicrous, Eurabia became the spiritual mother of a genre&quot;.

David Aaronovitch acknowledges that the threat of &quot;jihadist terror&quot; may be real, but that there is no threat of Eurabia. Aaronovitch concludes that those who study conspiracy theories will recognize Eurabia to be a theory that adds the &quot;Sad Dupes thesis to the Enemy Within idea&quot;.

Conservative US military analyst Ralph Peters has criticized the Eurabia narrative on the grounds that it is unlikely to happen as posited, citing the historical precedent of genocides frequently occurring in Europe, such as in the Balkans during the 1990s, and the Holocaust during World War II. Peters stated that if Muslims &quot;taking over&quot; Europe were imminent, Europeans would either forcibly deport their Muslims at best or engage in a genocide of them at worst, possibly leading to a U.S. intervention on behalf of persecuted Muslims.

In his 2007 book &quot;Wars of Blood and Faith&quot;, Peters states that far from being about to take over Europe through demographic change, &quot;Europe&#x27;s Muslims are living on borrowed time&quot; and that in the event of a major terrorist attack in Europe, thanks to the &quot;ineradicable viciousness&quot; of Europeans and what he perceives as a historical tendency to over-react to real or perceived threats, European Muslims &quot;will be lucky if they&#x27;re only deported&quot;.

According to Marján and Sapir, the very idea of &quot;Eurabia&quot; is &quot;based on an extremist conspiracy theory, according to which Europe and the Arab states would join forces to make life impossible for Israel and Islamize the old continent.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Race &amp; Class&quot; in 2006, author and freelance journalist Matt Carr argued that Eurabia had moved from &quot;an outlandish conspiracy theory&quot; to a &quot;dangerous Islamophobic fantasy&quot;. Carr states,

The Eurabia conspiracy theory has many similarities to &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. Arun Kundnani, writing for the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, notes that &quot;Eurabia&quot; fulfills the counter-jihad movement&#x27;s &quot;structural need&quot; for a conspiracy theory, and compares &quot;Eurabia&quot; to &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, while Carr compares it to the Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory.

Doug Saunders argues that pro-Al-Qaeda writers, and those who promote the Eurabia theory as truth, have a common extremism and world view, where &quot;there is one creature called &#x27;the Muslim&#x27; and another called &#x27;the Westerner. He proposes that there is no such distinction and that Muslims can become secular in the Western world.

<text>The Gateless Barrier (Mandarin: 無門關 &quot;Wúménguān&quot;; Japanese: 無門関 &quot;Mumonkan&quot;), sometimes translated as The Gateless Gate, is a collection of 48 Chan (Zen) koans compiled in the early 13th century by the Chinese Zen master Wumen Huikai (無門慧開; Japanese: &quot;Mumon Ekai&quot;; 1183–1260) during the Song dynasty. The title has a double meaning and can also be understood as Wumen&#x27;s Barrier; the compiler&#x27;s name, which literally means &quot;No Gate&quot;, is the same as the title&#x27;s first two characters. Wumen&#x27;s preface indicates that the volume was published in 1228. Each koan is accompanied by a commentary and verse by Wumen. A classic edition includes a 49th case composed by Anwan (pen name for ) in 1246. Wuliang Zongshou also supplemented the volume with a verse of four stanzas composed in 1230 about the three checkpoints of Zen master Huanglong. These three checkpoints of Huanglong should not be confused with Doushuai&#x27;s Three Checkpoints found in Case 47.

Along with the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; and the oral tradition of Hakuin Ekaku, &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; is a central work much used in Rinzai School practice. Five of the koans in the work concern the sayings and doings of Zhaozhou; four concern Ummon.

The common theme of the koans of the Wumen Guan and of Wumen&#x27;s comments is the inquiry and introspection of dualistic conceptualization. Each koan epitomizes one or more of the polarities of consciousness that act like an obstacle or wall to the insight. The student is challenged to transcend the polarity that the koan represents and demonstrate or show that transcendence to the Zen teacher.

== Structure and contents ==
The text was originally prepared by Wumen as a record of his teaching during a monastic training period held at &quot;Longxiang&quot; (Soaring Dragon) monastery in the summer of 1228. Wumen selected the 48 koans and commented on and added a verse for each koan. His teachings were transcribed and after the training period were compiled into the collection called the Wumen Guan.

As was customary in China at the time, an edition might have additions of text inserted by a subsequent owner or publisher. The best known version of the text is from the Japanese wood block edition made from the 1246 manuscript edition that contains the following sections.

* An untitled introduction by Xi Xiang (習巷), publisher of the 1228 edition, written in the self-deprecating style of Zen humor.
* An untitled dedication by Wumen to the Emperor and Empress. Works without such dedications were subject to Imperial censorship as being seditious.
* An untitled foreword by Wumen followed by a verse on the title.
* A table of contents with the title of each koan. However, the koans are unnumbered in both the table of contents and the body of the text and there are no page numbers in the text, so the table of contents is the list of the koan&#x27;s titles in order of appearance.
* The 48 koans presented in four parts consisting of (1) a title composed of four characters, (2) the body of the koan beginning with the name of the protagonist of the case, (3) a comment beginning with the words &quot;Wumen says&quot; (無門曰), and a verse beginning with the words &quot;The ode says&quot; (頌曰).
* An untitled afterword by Wumen that ends with the words &quot;The end of the volume the Gateless Checkpoint.&quot;
* An appendix believed to be written by Wumen titled &quot;Zen Caveats&quot; or &quot;Zen Warnings&quot; consisting of twelve one-line aphorisms about Zen practice written in the style of Zen contrariness that points to not falling for either side of dualistic thinking. For example, Zen is known as the school of Buddhism that does not stand on written words and one caveat says, &quot;Neglecting the written records with unrestrained ideas is falling into a deep pit.&quot;
* An appendix titled &quot;Huanglong&#x27;s Three Checkpoints&quot; (黄龍三關) written by Wuliang Zongshou (無量宗壽) in the late spring of 1230 C.E. Huanglong Huinan (J. Oryo Enan), 1002–1069, was a Zen master who promulgated three questions as one-line koans: &quot;Everyone exists by a particular cause of birth. What is your cause of birth?&quot; &quot;How is my hand like the hand of Buddha?&quot; &quot;How is my leg like the leg of a donkey?&quot; Wuliang wrote four four-line stanzas (Sanskrit &quot;gathas&quot;). Each of the first three stanzas comments on one of Huanglong&#x27;s three questions and the fourth stanza is a summation. Wuliang writes that he penned the four verses to thank and commemorate Wumen&#x27;s recent stay at Ruiyan (瑞巖) (Lucky Cliff) monastery where Wumen was the visiting head teacher for the training period.
* A short untitled addendum by Wuan written on the republishing of the work in the summer of 1245 C.E. Wuan called his brief addition the 49th case. It referred to Bodhidharma&#x27;s famous Zen motto: &quot;Not maintaining written words, but pointing directly to the human heart-mind to see one&#x27;s own nature to become Buddha&quot;.
* An undated postscript by Menggong (孟拱) consisting of a very brief story of a military ambassador who used his army as farmers to reclaim a wasteland and thus pacify the region. This appears to be a metaphor for the practice of Zen.
* An appendix by Anwan dated the beginning of summer 1246, presented in the same format as one of the 48 main koans and consisting of (1) an untitled introduction, (2) a title, &quot;Younger Brother&#x27;s 49th Standard Talk&quot;, (3) the body of the case, (4) a comment beginning with &quot;Anwan says&quot;, and (5) a verse beginning with &quot;The ode says&quot;, followed by Anwan&#x27;s signature with the place and date of the writing.

==List of chapters==
The table below lists the 48 chapters (&quot;koans&quot;/&quot;gong&#x27;ans&quot;) in &quot;The Gateless Barrier&quot;:

==Zen Caveats==
The Wumen Guan has an appendix titled &quot;Zen Caveats&quot; (禪箴) with one-line aphorisms dealing with Zen practice. The word &quot;zhēn&quot; (箴) means &quot;caveat&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;, or &quot;admonition&quot;, but it also has the meaning of &quot;needle&quot; or &quot;probe&quot; (as in acupuncture needles) and is sometimes translated as &quot;Zen Needles&quot;. As with the main koans, each caveat challenges the Zen student&#x27;s attachment to dualistic concepts, here those especially related to Zen practice.

* Following the rules and protecting the regulations is binding oneself without rope.
* Moving freely vertically and horizontally without obstruction is the way of outsiders and the nightmare army.
* To preserve the heart mind and to purify it by letting impurities settle to the bottom in quiescence is the perverted Zen of silent illumination.
* Neglecting the written records with unrestrained ideas is falling into a deep pit.
* To be awake and not ignorant is to wear chains and shoulder a cangue.
* Thinking good and thinking evil are the halls of heaven and hell.
* A view of Buddha and a view of Dharma are the two enclosing mountains of iron.
* A person who perceives thoughts as they immediately arise is fiddling with spectral consciousness.
* However, being on a high plateau practicing samadhi is the stratagem of living in the house of ghosts.
* To advance results in ignoring truth; to retreat results in contradicting the lineage.
* Neither to advance nor to retreat is being a breathing corpse.
* Just say, how will you walk?
* You must work hard to live in the present and, to finish, all the more. I do not advise the unfortunate excess of continual suffering.

<text>Bradley John Wall (born November 24, 1965) is a former Canadian politician who served as the 14th premier of Saskatchewan from November 21, 2007, until February 2, 2018. He is the fourth longest-tenured premier in the province&#x27;s history.

Wall was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as the member (MLA) for Swift Current in 1999 and he was re-elected four times, in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2016. He became leader of the Official Opposition Saskatchewan Party on July 15, 2004, replacing Elwin Hermanson, and he led the party to a majority government in the 2007 election. In the 2011 election, Wall&#x27;s government won the largest vote share in Saskatchewan&#x27;s history with 64% of the popular vote and 49 of the 58 seats in the legislature. The 2016 election delivered Wall another majority, marking the first time since 1925 that a party other than the New Democratic Party or its predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, had won three consecutive majority mandates.

For much of his tenure, Wall polled as the most popular premier in Canada, and he is credited with raising Saskatchewan&#x27;s profile on the national stage. Taking office during a period of growth catalyzed by rising global commodity prices, Wall&#x27;s government focused on attracting investment and championing the province&#x27;s resource-based industries. The government was persistently criticized for its privatization agenda, its disputes with organized labour, and its environmental stances. Commodity price crashes beginning in 2014 strained the province&#x27;s finances, and Wall&#x27;s popularity waned, particularly after introducing a severe austerity budget in 2017.

Wall announced his intention to retire as Saskatchewan Party Leader, Premier, and MLA for Swift Current on August 10, 2017. Wall was succeeded as Premier by Scott Moe on February 2, 2018.

==Early life and career==
Wall was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, the son of Alice (&quot;née&quot; Schmidt) and John Wall, Mennonites with Eastern European roots. John owned a local trucking company. Wall demonstrated an early interest in politics, citing time spent playing a Fraser Institute-funded economics board game called Poleconomy as an early influence. He also had a significant interest in music and hosted a rock show on a local radio station. Wall attended the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, running for student council and graduating with an honours degree in Public Administration and an advanced certificate in Political Studies.

During the 1980s, Wall began working as a political staffer, first in the office of Swift Current Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament Geoff Wilson in Ottawa. There he helped to found the &quot;Alliance for the Future of Young Canadians,&quot; a pro-free trade group. Wall returned to Saskatchewan and worked as a ministerial assistant in the Progressive Conservative government of Grant Devine in Regina. Wall worked for Graham Taylor, Minister of Public Participation, Tourism, Small Business, Co-operatives and Health, and for John Gerich, Associate Minister of Economic Development. The Devine government was swept from power in 1991 under the specter of provincial bankruptcy; then, by the middle of the 1990s, more than a dozen members of the former PC government were charged in a massive expense fraud scandal. An RCMP investigation led to the conviction of 14 MLAs who served in the Devine government, 6 of whom received jail time, including Gerich, who was sentenced to two years.

Wall described the downfall of the Progressive Conservatives as &quot;disheartening&quot; and the fallout, including the prison sentences, as &quot;powerful lessons.&quot; For most of the 1990s Wall&#x27;s attention shifted away from politics to working in business in Swift Current. In 1991, Wall became the director of business development for the City of Swift Current, a role for which he eventually won an &quot;Economic Developer of the Year&quot; award. At the time Wall also ran a consulting business, through which he attempted to move the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame from Kitchener, Ontario, to Swift Current; this effort failed and the museum ultimately moved to Calgary. Wall also launched a short-lived tourism business called the Last Stand Adventure Company that centred upon a &quot;Western ranch experience.&quot; Wall sat on a number of boards including being a founding member of the Southwest Centre for Entrepreneurial Development.

==Political career==
Wall&#x27;s first personal foray into provincial politics was in 1991 when he unsuccessfully sought the Progressive Conservative nomination for Swift Current. Despite missing out on the nomination, he still worked on the party&#x27;s unsuccessful re-election campaign.

=== MLA and Saskatchewan Party Leader (1999–2006) ===
Working in the private sector at the time, Wall has been credited with playing a backroom role in the creation of the Saskatchewan Party in 1997. The party formed as a coalition of sitting Progressive Conservative and Liberal Party MLAs and members, and was intended to unify opposition to the NDP. The Progressive Conservatives have not won a seat in any election since the formation of the Saskatchewan Party, and neither have the Liberals since winning 4 seats in 2003; as such, the emergence of the Saskatchewan Party has effectively created a two-party system in Saskatchewan politics.

After nearly a decade outside of electoral politics, Wall won the Saskatchewan Party nomination for Swift Current ahead of the 1999 election, the first since the Saskatchewan Party was formed, and he was elected MLA. He defeated NDP incumbent John Wall (no relation) with more than 50% of the vote as part of a wave of rural victories that saw the Saskatchewan Party win 25 seats and the NDP reduced to a minority government. Wall was appointed to the Saskatchewan Party&#x27;s front bench as Justice Critic, and later as Critic for Crown Corporations as well. After the election Wall also chaired a committee examining how to increase urban support for the party.

Inaugural Saskatchewan Party leader Elwin Hermanson resigned after the NDP regained a narrow majority in the 2003 provincial election. Wall announced his candidacy for the leadership and was ultimately acclaimed the party&#x27;s new leader on March 15, 2004. Wall committed to a review of Saskatchewan Party policies, aiming to present a more moderate platform that could expand the party&#x27;s support beyond rural areas. This process resulted in several socially conservative policies being jettisoned, such as work-for-welfare policies, so-called &quot;boot camps&quot; for young offenders, and a referendum on publicly funded abortions. New policy resolutions included calling for treatment for drug addicts, a patient-first review of the health care system, the development of a plan to recruit and retain health care professionals, the development of an integrated addictions strategy for young offenders, a comprehensive review of the justice system, the establishment of a provincial youth justice board to address youth crime, rehabilitation and restitution measures, support for victims of crime, the establishment of a university research chair in occupational health and safety, and a review of the Workers&#x27; Compensation Board. Wall made economic issues the party&#x27;s focal point and while in Opposition he released policy papers including &quot;The Promise of Saskatchewan: A New Vision for Saskatchewan&#x27;s Economy,&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Getting Saskatchewan Back on Track: Addressing Saskatchewan&#x27;s Labour Shortage,&quot; in 2006. Wall also introduced a Code of Ethics for party members and made a public commitment not to privatize or wind down the province&#x27;s crown corporations.

=== Premier of Saskatchewan (2007–2018) ===
Wall&#x27;s efforts to appeal to a broader base paid off in the 2007 election as the Saskatchewan Party won 38 seats, including eight seats between the province&#x27;s two largest urban areas in Regina and Saskatoon, securing a majority government. This made Wall the province&#x27;s 14th premier, and its first conservative premier since Devine. The win ushered in a period of prolonged electoral success for Wall and his party. In the 2011 election, the party secured a historic landslide victory, winning 49 seats and the highest vote share in the province&#x27;s history at 64%. This included making further inroads in urban centers as the party won 16 of 23 seats in Regina and Saskatoon. That year Wall also became the most popular premier in Canada, a distinction he would maintain through the 2016 election, which saw the Saskatchewan Party elected to a third consecutive majority with 62% of the vote and 51 seats in an expanded legislature. This marked the first time since 1925 that a non-CCF/NDP government had won three consecutive majorities in Saskatchewan. Wall&#x27;s personal popularity has been attributed to his skills as an orator and his sense of humour, and he has been credited with changing perceptions of the province, particularly through raising its profile on the national stage. Wall&#x27;s profile grew to the extent that he was considered synonymous with the party he led. However, Wall&#x27;s popularity began to wane during this third term, particularly after introducing an austerity budget in 2017. With his party losing ground in polling and in two 2017 by-elections, Wall announced in August of that year that he would be retiring from politics. This triggered what would become only the second contested leadership race in the history of the Saskatchewan Party. Rosthern-Shellbrook MLA Scott Moe won that contest on January 27, 2018, and succeeded Wall on February 2 when he was sworn in as premier.

Wall and his Saskatchewan Party took office at a time when global commodity prices began to soar, particularly for oil, potash, and uranium, but also for coal and agricultural products, and the economy started to boom accordingly. With resource revenues high, Wall focused on overseeing a period of growth and the province saw numbers of jobs increase by an average of 6,500 per year, while the province&#x27;s population grew every year under Wall&#x27;s premiership and by over 150,000 people overall. Wall instituted widespread tax cuts and guided investments in health care, education, and infrastructure. In 2010 he signed Saskatchewan onto the New West Trade Partnership Agreement with Alberta and British Columbia, a free-trade pact that expanded to include Manitoba in 2017. In 2014 the province was awarded a AAA credit rating. However, after commodity prices crashed beginning in 2014 the province ran into significant economic turmoil. While Wall had been successful early on in paying down Saskatchewan&#x27;s debt, which had nearly bankrupted the province in 1992 and reached a low of $7.9 billion in 2009, the debt rose rapidly after 2014 and would balloon to $14.8 billion in 2017. That year the province&#x27;s credit rating was downgraded to AA. Wall&#x27;s 2017 budget, the sixth deficit out of ten budgets under Wall, was deeply unpopular and criticized by many for its austerity and for disproportionately burdening poor and marginalized citizens in its efforts to address fiscal mismanagement. While the budget maintained a commitment to lowering corporate tax rates, the provincial sales tax was increased and deep cuts were made to social services and education. The budget also included cuts to grants to municipalities, which created budget crises for a number of municipalities.

Throughout his tenure as premier Wall was known as a staunch defender of Saskatchewan resource-based industries, especially potash and oil and gas. In 2010, Wall rose to national prominence through his opposition to an attempted hostile takeover of Saskatoon-based PotashCorp, which was the world&#x27;s largest potash producer, by Australian mining giant BHP. The $38.6 billion deal would have been the largest takeover in Canadian history, but the premier—who sought the advice of former NDP premier Roy Romanow and former Alberta premier Peter Lougheed—argued that Saskatchewan stood to lose billions in resource revenues and that such a takeover would damage Canada&#x27;s strategic interests. The federal government ultimately blocked the deal, and Wall was lauded for his lobbying efforts. Wall persistently championed the province&#x27;s fossil fuel industries as well. In 2011, the Saskatchewan Party led an investment of $1.2 billion to build the world&#x27;s first industrial-scale carbon capture and storage unit at SaskPower&#x27;s Boundary Dam power station in order to extend the use of coal in the province. In 2014 Wall was vocal in lobbying the federal government to strengthen its regulation of the oil industry, arguing that stronger measures would aid pipeline development. However, Wall would later be a vocal critic of efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions, considering federal efforts like the Pan-Canadian Framework on climate change and global efforts like the Paris Climate Accord to be threats to the province&#x27;s energy industry. Wall was particularly vehement in his opposition to a federal carbon tax, an issue Wall helped to put at the center of conservative political agendas across the country and at the national level. Wall also took aim at civil society calls for climate action, for example lambasting the Leap Manifesto and calling it an &quot;existential threat&quot; to the oil industry. Such stances drew the ire of environmentalists, and the province was persistently criticized for its environmental measures and its lack of regulation of industries in particular. The 2016 spill of more than 200,000 liters of oil into the North Saskatchewan River from a Husky pipeline was blamed in part on a lack of proper regulation and monitoring. The province&#x27;s 2017 climate change plan, meanwhile, was largely panned by environmental experts and organizations, including the Saskatchewan Environmental Society.

Despite consistent growth in jobs Wall persistently found his government at odds with organized labour, beginning with 2007 efforts at revising provincial labour legislation. The government introduced two bills that were maligned as anti-labour as they removed the right to strike for more than 65,000 workers and made it harder for workers to unionize; one of the bills was ultimately struck down after being deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2015. After that decision, Wall threatened to use the notwithstanding clause to maintain the legislation, but never did so. Organized labour was also central to protests against the 2017 austerity budget. Wall and his government were also critiqued for their privatization agenda, which included an estimated sale of $1.1 billion in public assets and the loss of more than 1,200 public sector jobs. One of the most controversial decisions of the 2017 budget was the shuttering of the Saskatchewan Transportation Company, a provincially-owned bus company that serviced all areas of the province. The Wall government also faced criticism for its costly application of the Lean program to the healthcare system. It also introduced private-sector involvement in health care, although it claimed some success in reducing surgical wait times, a longstanding political issue in the province. A major investment in the building of the Global Transportation Hub outside Regina also became controversial for questionable and allegedly fraudulent land deals.

In 2013, Wall attended the Bilderberg Conference, an annual private conference of approximately 120 to 140 invited political guests from North America and Europe.

After 2015 Wall continued to keep a high profile on the national stage as a frequent critic of both Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta NDP Leader and Premier Rachel Notley. In 2015 Wall wrote a letter to Trudeau urging him to suspend the federal government&#x27;s plan to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees before the end of that year. He would go on to consistently target Trudeau over the federal carbon tax, laying the groundwork for the province to launch a constitutional challenge against the measure in April 2018. Wall was also critical of Notley&#x27;s efforts to strengthen national efforts to address climate change, and by 2017 Saskatchewan and Alberta were engaging in a series of trade disputes that began when Wall publicly attempted to lure energy companies to move their headquarters from Calgary to Saskatchewan. Relations between the provinces were so dire at times that their respective trade ministers were not speaking.

=== Post-retirement ===
On May 1, 2018, Wall announced he would begin working as an advisor for the Calgary law firm Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP.

Wall remained active in political circles even after retiring from electoral politics. He was considered a strong candidate for leadership of the federal Conservative Party, but he declined to run in the party&#x27;s 2020 leadership contest. Wall did play a central role in the creation of the Buffalo Project, an American-style political action committee (PAC) aiming to influence federal politics, in Alberta. The Project claims to stand up for the interests of western industries, particularly the energy sector. Wall was influential in laying the groundwork for the project, including raising funds, and although he did not take on a formal role with the group he was a key advisor. Although the group claims to be federalist, it has been associated with western separatism, particularly after the Saskatchewan branch of the separatist Wexit party rebranded itself as the Buffalo Party.

==Controversies==
After Wall became the Saskatchewan Party leader, controversies from his days as a political staffer surfaced. During the 2006 spring session, NDP MLAs revealed that Wall had worked in John Gerich&#x27;s office at the time when $15,000 worth of alcohol was incorrectly allocated to the Minister&#x27;s office. Wall admitted to the media of his partaking in the alcohol and knowing it was &quot;wrong&quot; and stated he considered it &quot;an asset&quot; to have learned from the government&#x27;s activities. Then on April 3, 2008, the NDP released a video tape, filmed during the 1991 election campaign, that was found at a former Conservative MP&#x27;s office. The video showed Conservative MP and former Saskatchewan Party staffer Tom Lukiwski making homophobic remarks and Wall using an exaggerated Ukrainian accent and making derogatory statements about then-NDP leader Roy Romanow; Wall apologized for his remarks.

In 2015, Brad Wall was named in a lawsuit against himself, Rob Norris—the former Minister of Advanced Education—and the University of Saskatchewan and its Board of Governors for the controversial firing of the President, Ilene Busch-Vishniac. Wall and Norris are accused of unlawfully inserting themselves into the Board&#x27;s decision to fire Busch-Vishniac. The lawsuit is ongoing.

In January 2016, inmates at the Regina Correctional Facility staged a hunger strike, alleging that they had been served unsafe and under-cooked food. Wall told the media that if prisoners did not like the food they should not &quot;go to jail.&quot; Wall&#x27;s comments were heavily criticized for ignoring the issue and lacking compassion.

In 2017, Wall raised the story of an NDP member and sexual assault victim in Question Period in response to a question about the Global Transportation Hub land deal. Wall was criticized for politicizing the issue of sexual assault. Interim NDP leader Nicole Sarauer described the remarks as &quot;disgusting&quot; and asked he withdraw the comments, while the victim took to social media to demand an apology. After initially stating in the legislature that he would make &quot;no apology,&quot; Wall later publicly apologized to the victim, saying he &quot;was not aware&quot; that she &quot;did not want the matter raised in this forum.&quot;

In 2017, Wall addressed a room of Saskatchewan Party members at a nomination meeting, where he recited a joke about the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel. British Columbia&#x27;s Métis Federation labelled Wall&#x27;s joke as &quot;foolish&quot; and &quot;insensitive&quot; and called for an apology. In 2018, Wall posted a derogatory message to social media in opposition to the federal carbon tax, which read &quot;Usually when someone tells you to send in money but you’ll get more back in return, it’s a Nigerian prince.&quot; Wall deleted the post and issued an apology to Saskatchewan&#x27;s Nigerian community.

In 2022, court records revealed that Wall gave advice to Chris Barber as he helped to organize the convoy protest that went on to occupy downtown Ottawa that year.

==Personal life==
Wall resides in Swift Current. He is married to Tami, whom he met in 1984 when they were both students at the University of Saskatchewan—they married in 1991. Together they have three children. Their son Colter Wall is a country musician.

Wall is an avid football fan, supporting both the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League and the National Football League&#x27;s Oakland Raiders. He is also a classic car enthusiast and owns a Cadillac that was once owned by Waylon Jennings. As of 2021, Wall was a partner in his son Colter&#x27;s Cattle Company, which operates a ranch in the Cypress Hills.

Wall was made a member of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2024. In June 2024, Wall was inducted into Saskatchewan&#x27;s Oil &amp; Gas Hall of Fame.

<text>The control of ventilation is the physiological mechanisms involved in the control of breathing, which is the movement of air into and out of the lungs. Ventilation facilitates respiration. Respiration refers to the utilization of oxygen and balancing of carbon dioxide by the body as a whole, or by individual cells in cellular respiration.

The most important function of breathing is the supplying of oxygen to the body and balancing of the carbon dioxide levels. Under most conditions, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), or concentration of carbon dioxide, controls the respiratory rate.

The peripheral chemoreceptors that detect changes in the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide are located in the arterial aortic bodies and the carotid bodies. Central chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to changes in the pH of the blood, (resulting from changes in the levels of carbon dioxide) and they are located on the medulla oblongata near to the medullar respiratory groups of the respiratory center.
Information from the peripheral chemoreceptors is conveyed along nerves to the respiratory groups of the respiratory center. There are four respiratory groups, two in the medulla and two in the pons. The two groups in the pons are known as the pontine respiratory group.

# Dorsal respiratory group – in the medulla
# Ventral respiratory group – in the medulla
# Pneumotaxic center – various nuclei of the pons
#Apneustic center – nucleus of the pons

From the respiratory center, the muscles of respiration, in particular the diaphragm, are activated to cause air to move in and out of the lungs.

==Control of respiratory rhythm==

=== Ventilatory pattern ===

Breathing is normally an unconscious, involuntary, automatic process. The pattern of motor stimuli during breathing can be divided into an inhalation stage and an exhalation stage. Inhalation shows a sudden, ramped increase in motor discharge to the respiratory muscles (and the pharyngeal constrictor muscles). Before the end of inhalation, there is a decline in, and end of motor discharge. Exhalation is usually silent, except at high respiratory rates.

The respiratory centre in the medulla and pons of the brainstem controls the rate and depth of respiration, (the respiratory rhythm), through various inputs. These include signals from the peripheral chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors; from the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve carrying input from the pulmonary stretch receptors, and other mechanoreceptors in the lungs. as well as signals from the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus.

* Medulla 
** ventral respiratory group (includes the pre-Bötzinger complex). The ventral respiratory group controls voluntary forced exhalation and acts to increase the force of inhalation. Regulates rhythm of inhalation and exhalation.
** dorsal respiratory group (solitary nucleus). The dorsal respiratory group controls mostly movements of inhalation and their timing.
* Pons
** pneumotaxic center.
*** Coordinates speed of inhalation and exhalation
*** Sends inhibitory impulses to the inspiratory area
*** Involved in fine tuning of respiration rate.
** apneustic center
*** Coordinates speed of inhalation and exhalation.
*** Sends stimulatory impulses to the inspiratory area – activates and prolongs inhalations
*** Overridden by pneumotaxic control from the apneustic area to end inhalation

=== Control of ventilatory pattern ===
Ventilation is normally unconscious and automatic, but can be overridden by conscious alternative patterns. Thus the emotions can cause yawning, laughing, sighing (etc.), social communication causes speech, song and whistling, while entirely voluntary overrides are used to blow out candles, and breath holding (for instance, to swim underwater). Hyperventilation may be entirely voluntary or in response to emotional agitation or anxiety, when it can cause the distressing hyperventilation syndrome. The voluntary control can also influence other functions such as the heart rate as in yoga practices and meditation.

The ventilatory pattern is also temporarily modified by complex reflexes such as sneezing, straining, burping, coughing and vomiting.

=== Determinants of ventilatory rate ===
Ventilatory rate (respiratory minute volume) is tightly controlled and determined primarily by blood levels of carbon dioxide as determined by metabolic rate. Blood levels of oxygen become important in hypoxia. These levels are sensed by central chemoreceptors on the surface of the medulla oblongata for decreased pH (indirectly from the increase of carbon dioxide in cerebrospinal fluid), and the peripheral chemoreceptors in the arterial blood for oxygen and carbon dioxide. Afferent neurons from the peripheral chemoreceptors are via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and the vagus nerve (CN X).

The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) rises in the blood when the metabolic use of oxygen (O2), and the production of CO2 is increased during, for example, exercise. The CO2 in the blood is transported largely as bicarbonate (HCO3−) ions, by conversion first to carbonic acid (H2CO3), by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and then by disassociation of this acid to H+ and HCO3−. Build-up of CO2 therefore causes an equivalent build-up of the disassociated hydrogen ions, which, by definition, decreases the pH of the blood. The pH sensors on the brain stem immediately respond to this fall in pH, causing the respiratory center to increase the rate and depth of breathing. The consequence is that the partial pressure of CO (PCO2) does not change from rest going into exercise. During very short-term bouts of intense exercise the release of lactic acid into the blood by the exercising muscles causes a fall in the blood plasma pH, independently of the rise in the PCO2, and this will stimulate pulmonary ventilation sufficiently to keep the blood pH constant at the expense of a lowered PCO2.

Mechanical stimulation of the lungs can trigger certain reflexes as discovered in animal studies. In humans, these seem to be more important in neonates and ventilated patients, but of little relevance in health. The tone of respiratory muscle is believed to be modulated by muscle spindles via a reflex arc involving the spinal cord.

Drugs can greatly influence the rate of respiration. Opioids and anesthetics tend to depress ventilation, by decreasing the normal response to raised carbon dioxide levels in the arterial blood. Stimulants such as amphetamines can cause hyperventilation.

Pregnancy tends to increase ventilation (lowering plasma carbon dioxide tension below normal values). This is due to increased progesterone levels and results in enhanced gas exchange in the placenta.

=== Feedback control ===
Receptors play important roles in the regulation of respiration and include the central and peripheral chemoreceptors, and pulmonary stretch receptors, a type of mechanoreceptor.

* Central chemoreceptors of the central nervous system, located on the ventrolateral medullary surface, are sensitive to the pH of their environment.
* Peripheral chemoreceptors act most importantly to detect variation of the PO2 in the arterial blood, in addition to detecting arterial PCO2 and pH.
* Mechanoreceptors are located in the airways and parenchyma, and are responsible for a variety of reflex responses. These include:
** The Hering-Breuer reflex that terminates inhalation to prevent over inflation of the lungs, and the reflex responses of coughing, airway constriction, and hyperventilation.
** The upper airway receptors are responsible for reflex responses such as, sneezing, coughing, closure of glottis, and hiccups.
** The spinal cord reflex responses include the activation of additional respiratory muscles as compensation, gasping response, hypoventilation, and an increase in breathing frequency and volume.
** The nasopulmonary and nasothoracic reflexes regulate the mechanism of breathing through deepening the inhale. Triggered by the flow of the air, the pressure of the air in the nose, and the quality of the air, impulses from the nasal mucosa are transmitted by the trigeminal nerve to the respiratory center in the brainstem, and the generated response is transmitted to the bronchi, the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm.
** Head&#x27;s paradoxical reflex where sudden inflation of the lung causes a transient respiratory effort or gasp.

<doc id="529871" wikidata="Q2053320" url="?curid=529871" title="Weapon X">
<text>Weapon X is a fictional government genetic research facility project appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They were conducted by Department K, which turned willing and unwilling beings into living weapons to carry out covert missions like assassination or eliminating potential threats to the government. It was similar to human enhancement experiments in the real world, but it captured mutants and did experiments on them to enhance their abilities such as superpowers, turning them into weapons. They also mutated baseline humans. The Weapon X Project produced Wolverine, Leech, Deadpool, Sabretooth, and Weapon H.

The fictional experiment X, or the brutal adamantium-skeletal bonding process, written by Barry Windsor-Smith in his classic story &quot;Weapon X&quot; (originally published in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #72–84 in 1991), was eventually revealed as part of the &quot;Weapon X Project.&quot; Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;New X-Men&quot; in 2002 further revealed that Weapon X was the tenth of a series of such projects, collectively known as the Weapon Plus Program, and the X in &quot;Weapon X&quot; referred not to the letter X but the Roman numeral for the number 10. The first project, Weapon I, pertained to the Super Soldier Project that created Captain America.

==Publication history==
The Weapon X organization was created by writer Len Wein and artist Herb Trimpe, and first appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #180 (October 1974).

==Fictional organization biography==
===Original installment===
The code name &quot;Weapon X&quot; was originally mentioned in the first appearance of Wolverine in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #180 in 1974 since which it has been implied that he was connected to a shady and malevolent government program. In the 1991 story arc &quot;Weapon X&quot; (originally published in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #72–84 in 1991), the project was designated Experiment X, and it was revealed that it was responsible for bonding the adamantium to Wolverine&#x27;s skeleton, making him indestructible. It also subjected him to brainwashing in order to bring out his most basic murderous instincts and to transform him into the perfect assassin. The scientists christened their new killing machine &quot;Weapon X&quot;.

Wolverine&#x27;s solo series issues #48-50 (1992) revealed that Project X also created fabricated memories in the minds of several of its subjects.

Weapon X operated through Canada&#x27;s Department K and was directed by Professor Andre Thorton. At his side were Dr. Abraham Cornelius, Dr. Carol Hines, and Dr. Dale Rice. John Sublime, the director of Weapon Plus, was always behind the scenes. Some of the work of Weapon X was based on the experiments detailed on the journals of Nazi scientist Nathan Essex which were obtained by Weapon Plus after the end of World War II.

The project&#x27;s original test subjects were the members of Team X, a covert ops CIA team (consisting of Wolverine/Logan, Sabretooth/Victor Creed, Maverick/Christoph Nord, Silver Fox, Mastodon, Major Arthur Barrington, Psi-Borg/Aldo Ferro, Wildcat/Noel Higgins and Kestrel/John Wraith). The telepath Psi-Borg was involved in the creation of the victims&#x27; memory implants, in exchange for being endowed with immortality. The test subjects were policed by an adaptive robot enforcer, called Shiva, should any of the agents go rogue.

What Wolverine and his fellow X-Men ignored for many years is that Weapon X was part of a larger program called Weapon Plus, a United States super-soldier program created in the 1940s with the purpose of creating super-soldiers and assassins not only to be employed in conventional wars, but also to be employed for the extermination of mutants. Weapon X was the first iteration in Weapon Plus that victimized mutants.

What the Weapon X scientists did not foresee is that the experimentation on Wolverine would cause him to go on a murderous rampage, which allowed the escape of the other test subjects, and caused the death of Dale Rice, among dozens of other members of Weapon X staff, both scientists and military.

===The Deadpool===

Weapon X was temporarily shut down, but eventually was reinstated. Subsequent attempts at recreating the success seen by Weapon X with Wolverine include Native, Kimura and X-23 (the 23rd attempt to clone Wolverine who was designed to also hunt down rogue agents). The &quot;Weapon X Re-Creation Project&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Facility&quot; was headed by Director Martin Sutter, Dr. Dale Rice&#x27;s son Dr. Zander Rice, and Dr. Sarah Kinney. Like Weapon X once did, the Facility has also branched off from the main Weapon X Program. Latter creations of The Facility, now under the direction of Dr. Adam Harkins, include Predator X.

===Second installment===
At some point, Weapon X branched off from Weapon Plus&#x27; control and was solely headed up by Canada&#x27;s Department K. A new generation of agents were created: Deadpool, Garrison Kane (who took on the moniker &quot;Weapon X&quot;), Slayback, Sluggo, Wyre, Wildchild, and Ajax, among others. Weapon X used Logan&#x27;s DNA in order to endow its agents with healing powers. The batch produced many additional failures, which were sent to a facility for dissection to determine the cause of their failures. These rejects were freed by Deadpool when he escaped from the facility.

A smaller experiment was later developed by Department K with a New Zealand terrorist (who would become the third individual to be known as Weapon X) merging him with Thetagen-24: the most dangerous lethal symbiotic bacterial colony ever created.

Typhoid Mary was also a subject, when she was captured by an Antarctic facility continuing research for the Weapon X Project, specifically the mental faculties of the mutant mind. Their experiments helped give birth to Mary&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; persona, which exhibited increased psychokinetic powers.

===Third installment===
In Weapon X series number 6, director Malcolm Colcord forms the third version of the Weapon X Project, designed to monitor and eliminate mutants. Colcord, once a security guard at the first Weapon X project, suffered severe facial lacerations during an escape attempt by the mutant Wolverine. Unlike the previous two installments of Weapon X, the third Project was completely U.S.-based and focused not only on the creation of living weapons, but also on the ultimate goal of Colcord, the creation of death camps.

The Director initially uses Weapon X as his personal strike force to exact revenge against Wolverine. He soon begins using its resources for the capturing and imprisonment of mutants in the secret government death camp called Neverland. Mutants who are not suitable to be used as military weapons would be executed, while those that are suitable are given the choice to join Weapon X or die. A number of mutants, such as Cecilia Reyes, Maggott, Ape, Tarbaby, Leech and many others were arrested by Weapon X&#x27;s agents and sent to Neverland. Those mutants deemed useless to the project were killed in gas chambers, while others were brainwashed to become Weapon X operatives. The organs of the executed prisoners were then sent to the U-Men.

The agents of the third Weapon X were Agent Brent Jackson, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent; Sabretooth, who was given new adamantium implants; the shapeshifter Copycat; Deadpool; and Mauvais. Later on, Deadpool went rogue and new operatives were recruited into Weapon X, many of whom had their powers enhanced or were brainwashed into servitude. Maverick was saved from certain death and his powers were enhanced with the purpose of assassinating Wolverine, thus Agent Zero was created. Former member of Alpha Flight Wildchild was brainwashed and further mutated into a Nosferatu-like feral humanoid.

Former mutant terrorist Marrow had her powers set to a controllable level, restoring the young woman&#x27;s natural beauty. Sauron&#x27;s personality was merged with that of his Karl Lykos self and his energy-draining powers enhanced so he could fire energy blasts. Garrison Kane was further transformed into a cybernetic being. Aurora was kidnapped and brainwashed, like Madison Jeffries, who was extracted from the terrorist group known as the Zodiac and used to create hundreds of Boxbots loyal to Weapon X to serve as guards at Neverland.

Washout had his powers enhanced, though at a heavy cost. Each usage of his powers endangered his life and eventually, he dies trying to kill Colcord. Mesmero joins willingly, while Reaper and Wildside (former members of the Mutant Liberation Front) became agents of the program in exchange for their lives. The psychic mutant Jack-in-the-Box joins after his legs and arms were amputated. He becomes a living polygraph.

Unbeknownst to all except Sabretooth, Mister Sinister was disguised as the head scientist at the Neverland facility, Doctor Robert Windsor. As Windsor, Mister Sinister supposedly helped some mutants escape from Neverland, but he was only taking them to his own secret labs.

After some time, Brent Jackson (the only human officially on the team) took over as Director, during a mutiny by the team in conjunction with an attack by mutants from the Underground. Cable led this group, in a mission to destroy Weapon X and expose its existence and its human rights violations. Washout and Garrison Kane died in the event, while Sabretooth was washed away into the sewers after a battle with Marrow. Marrow used the battle to escape from Weapon X, eventually taking over the Mutant Underground, now reformed as the third incarnation of Gene Nation.

Colcord fled Weapon X with the always loyal Jeffries and Aurora as well. Director Brent Jackson&#x27;s team consisted of Wildchild, Sauron, Agent Zero, Mesmero, Jack-in-the-Box, and newly recruited Chamber, whose face was restored by the program&#x27;s scientists. Chamber was originally a double agent working for the X-Men, but was subsequently brainwashed into Jackson&#x27;s service. Mister Sinister, under the alias of Dr. Windsor, remains at Weapon X. At some point, Jackson&#x27;s team fought with Colcord&#x27;s Boxbots. Colcord regains control of Weapon X.

Following M-Day, both Chamber and Mesmero are rendered powerless. Neverland is shut down and the prisoners, either powered or depowered, are executed by hosts of Boxbots. Records of the massive executions are discovered by Beast in the Endangered Species storyline, which also hints that some of the bodies of the prisoners executed prior to M-Day were sent to Ord and used in the research to develop the cure for mutation.

In the aftermath of the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Cyclops and his team of Uncanny X-Men have taken up residency in the Weapon X facility, which they have rebuilt into a school named the New Charles Xavier&#x27;s School for the new mutants that began appearing.

===Fourth installment===
As part of the &quot;RessurXion&quot; event, a fourth installment of the Weapon X Project debuted. During the &quot;Weapons of Mutant Destruction&quot; storyline, the Weapon X Project is interested in Lady Deathstrike, Warpath, Domino, Wolverine, and Sabretooth for a new experiment. It is shown that the Weapon X Project is turning civilians into cyborgs made of Adamantium sent to hunt a specific group of mutants, forcing Old Man Logan to team up with Sabretooth to stop them. Old Man Logan and his allies alongside Amadeus Cho&#x27;s Hulk form discover that Weapon X has been experimenting on humans by grafting the DNA of Wolverine and Hulk into them while also applying Adamantium to their bones. In addition, it is shown that the director of the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Project is a somehow-revived William Stryker.

The latest project H-Alpha emerges where it kills the lesser experiment H-Beta. Unfortunately, Dr. Aliana Alba lost control of it even when Amadeus Cho&#x27;s Hulk form joins the battle while William Stryker and Dr. Alba get away. Following the fierce battle, H-Alpha flees causing Old Man Logan&#x27;s group to go after it before the Weapon X Project plans to regain control of it.

When the Weapon X Project caught up to H-Alpha, Dr. Alba regained control of H-Alpha. She then stated to the controlled H-Alpha that he has a killer instinct where he is to kill anyone that the Weapon X Project wants him to kill. As Old Man Logan&#x27;s group faces off against H-Alpha, X-23&#x27;s Wolverine appearance was able to free Weapon H from Dr. Alba&#x27;s control enabling Weapon H to leave the area so that he can remember who he was.

The &quot;Hulkverines&quot; miniseries showed Hulk and Wolverine&#x27;s reactions to the Weapon X Project creating Weapon H and their search for them as well as dealing with the collaboration of Leader and Dr. Alba.

===Implosion and Xeno emergence===
Following Professor Charles Xavier founding a sovereign nation state for mutants on the living island Krakoa, he made sure all shadow agencies around the world were defunded and disbanded, Weapon X among them.

However remnants of those agencies gathered together and established Xeno a global organization with ties to anti-mutant politicians and business leaders. Xeno are dedicated to bioengineering themselves into weapons. Upon discovering this, Professor X tasked Domino to infiltrate the organization to gather intel. Domino was discovered during her infiltration, and The Xeno&#x27;s operatives used grafts of her skin on their genetically altered soldiers to allow them to evade Krakoa&#x27;s security protocols. The Xeno strike team was able to attack Krakoa, and assassinate Xavier.

==The Weapon X codename==
* In mainstream Marvel, Logan was the first individual known as Weapon X. After Wolverine, Garrison Kane went by the alias of Weapon X before leaving the Canadian Government to work as a mercenary again.
* A short time later, a New Zealand terrorist was captured by the Canadian Government and subjected to an experiment which bonded him to a bacteria colony, called Thetagen-24. This symbiosis proved dangerous as the union created a deadly energy field which could only be contained by an armored suit that was powered by the energy field.
* In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; alternate universe, Logan was known as Weapon X.

==Series called &quot;Weapon X&quot;==
===1991 storyline===
The chronicle of Wolverine&#x27;s days with the Weapon X project, from the bonding of adamantium to his bones to his escape from the project, were revealed in the &quot;Weapon X&quot; story arc, written and illustrated by Barry Windsor-Smith and published in installments in the anthology series &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; in 1991. An expanded version of the story has been produced by writer Marc Cerasini and published by Pocket Star Books in 2004. The story intertwines with some of Wolverine&#x27;s past, and eventually ends with Wolverine&#x27;s rampage being described in full, only to be revealed as the work of a Virtual reality system which actually &quot;predicted&quot; the events of Wolverine&#x27;s escape which then occur in real life moments later.

===Age of Apocalypse series===
In 1995, &quot;Weapon X&quot; became the name of the Age of Apocalypse variation of Wolverine&#x27;s ongoing series (during the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, each X-Men series was renamed and renumbered for four monthly issues and then reverted to the original name and numbering after the storyline ended).

===2002 ongoing series===
&quot;Weapon X&quot; is the name of a 28-issue ongoing series published by Marvel from 2002 to 2004, featuring the third installment of the Weapon X project. It was written by Frank Tieri, who previously wrote the ongoing &quot;Wolverine&quot; title and had created the group&#x27;s most recent incarnation in the pages of said book. The series began in 2002 and quickly gained critical praise for its use of minor characters as well as reviving characters such as Cable, who at the time wasn&#x27;t featured in a monthly title. However, sales sagged following the removal of Cable from the book after the first year, on orders of Rob Liefeld, who was working on a new &quot;X-Force&quot; project. 

Frank Tieri was forced to drop nearly all of his subplots, including the introduction of a mutant concentration camp run by Mr. Sinister that featured many popular B-List mutant characters, and take the book into the controversial direction involving the introduction of X-23, and Wolverine and Sabretooth&#x27;s quest to find the recently revived John Sublime. The new direction failed to catch on, mainly due to the books&#x27; over-exposure of Wolverine and the drastic change in tone of the book. It was cancelled with all of its storylines unresolved.

===2005 limited series===
A limited series &quot;Weapon X: Days of Future Now&quot; in 2005 was released that resolved all of the dangling storylines and revealed that Wolverine&#x27;s disfigurement of Weapon X Director Malcolm Colcord was the catalyst for the creation of a future similar to the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; scenario.

===&quot;Wolverine: Weapon X&quot;===
An ongoing series launched in 2009 titled &quot;&quot;. The series was written by Jason Aaron and illustrated by Ron Garney.

===2017 ongoing series===
As part of their &quot;RessurXion&quot; event, a new ongoing series for Weapon X written by Greg Pak and illustrated by Greg Land was launched along with other new ongoing X-Men titles. This series takes place after the events seen in &quot;X-Men Prime&quot; when Lady Deathstrike gets kidnapped by the new version of Weapon X.

==Membership==
==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; alternate timeline, Logan was never actually called Wolverine; he retained the &quot;Weapon X&quot; codename, through his entire career.

Dead Man Wade, the AoA counterpart of Deadpool, did not receive his healing factor from the Weapon X program but from Apocalypse, apparently after Apocalypse dismantled the program, and became part of Apocalypse&#x27;s elite assassin trio dubbed the &#x27;Pale Riders&#x27;.

===&quot;Exiles&quot;===
In the series &quot;Exiles&quot;, whose cast is a group of characters from alternate timelines who travel to other realities, Weapon X is a group of superbeings that have been torn from their respective realities to fulfill various missions for the Exiles&#x27; employer, the Timebroker. To return home, they have been forced to jump from reality to reality, repairing the broken links in the chain of time. Unlike their more heroic counterparts, the Exiles, this ruthless assemblage will resort to any means necessary to attain their goals. They act without mercy and without conscience.

The team&#x27;s membership has changed through time. The first known mission given to Weapon X was to capture the Hulk. At the time, the membership of Weapon X consisted of Sabretooth (Victor Creed of the Age of Apocalypse, the father figure of the Exiles&#x27; leader Blink), Deadpool and Garrison Kane. Later it was revealed that the team also included Wolverine, Maverick and Mesmero. The six chose the name &#x27;Weapon X&#x27; due to their common ties to the Project in their native timelines, although, save for Sabretooth, the background of all the other members are a mystery. The Exiles completed the mission without realizing the existence of Weapon X, but the Weapon X trio saw the Exiles and their leader, Blink.

When the two teams met face-to-face for the first time, Weapon X was already a sextet: Sabretooth, Deadpool, the Spider (Peter Parker, an alternate version of Spider-Man, here a psychotic murderer with the symbiotic alien costume of Carnage), Storm (Ororo Munroe, here only sixteen years old and already ruler of more than half of Africa), the Vision (a version that remained an emotionless robot), and the Hulk (Jennifer Walters, normally called the She-Hulk, here a former mob bookkeeper transformed into an eight-foot green-skinned powerhouse). It was mentioned that the Vision had replaced Kane and that the Spider had replaced Matt Murdock (Daredevil). Later, Iron Man replaced Deadpool.

The next time the team was seen, Angel (now a gun-toting assassin) replaced Iron Man and the team leader was now Gambit instead of Sabretooth. Later, the Hulk was replaced by Colossus, and eventually Angel was replaced by Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers).

When Storm died, she was replaced by Hyperion. Later, Colossus and the Vision were replaced by the Hulk (Bruce Banner) and Firestar. These two, along with Gambit, tried to stop Hyperion, the Spider and Ms. Marvel when they decided to abandon their mission and rule a world. They failed, and the next mission given to both the Exiles and Weapon X was to kill enough members of each team so that there would be only six survivors in total. Ultimately, all members of this Weapon X team were killed in the fight.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In &quot;Ultimate X-Men,&quot; which takes place in the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Weapon X project has a similar intention and similar methodology as its Marvel Universe counterpart, as it was also responsible for bonding adamantium to Wolverine&#x27;s skeleton. 

Ultimate Weapon X was headed by Colonel John Wraith, a mutant-hating commando, and Dr. Cornelius. The program was sanctioned by S.H.I.E.L.D. sometime before or during the Gulf War to capture mutants and force them to carry out covert missions for the US Government. Their main facility was located in Finland (as opposed to the mainstream that was originally located in Canada). The lineup included, at times, Wolverine/Logan aka &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, Sabretooth, Rogue, Juggernaut, Nightcrawler, and the rest of the original Ultimate X-Men, for a short time after the program invaded Xavier&#x27;s mansion and took them captive. 

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. There was an unidentified Weapon X specimen whose adamantium-laced skeleton is on display in a Damage Control facility.

The Eurasian Republic ruled by the Rasputin family (consisting of Colossus, Magik, and Omega Red) has a variation of the Weapon X Project called Directorate X.

===Wolverine: The End===
In a possible future of &quot;&quot;, Wolverine attempts to hunt down the people involved in Weapon X, and discovers not only that they have been dead and gone for many decades, but also what may have been the very first subject of the project: his elder brother John Howlett, who he had been told died when he (Wolverine) was still just a baby. In addition to having bone claws, enhanced senses and a healing factor, the elder Howlett appeared to have some kind of ethereal form which allowed him to phase through things and somehow conduct energy blasts. John Howlett claimed that he was driven mad at first by his parents&#x27; seeming abandonment of him when his powers first manifested. Had he been in his insane state of mind when he first encountered Wolverine, he claims he would likely have attempted to kill him.

===X-Men Noir===
Set in &quot;Marvel Noir&quot;, this Weapon X is a 1940s German based government agency led by the &quot;Red Rose&quot;/Jiamine Szardos/Amanda Sefton, a former circus artist. She that employs agents like Andreas Strucker/Fenris and boyfriend &quot;the Demon&quot;. However the spy Calvin Rankin revealed that Weapon X is named after him as Berlin seeks to replicate his skills in warfare.

<doc id="529873" wikidata="Q1889165" url="?curid=529873" title="Moscow Manege">
<text>The Moscow Manege (, ) is an oblong building along the west side of Manege Square, which was cleared in the 1930s and lies adjacent to Red Square. It is the site of Moscow Design Museum since 2012.

Designed by Spanish engineer Agustín de Betancourt with a roof without internal support for (the building&#x27;s width), it was erected from 1817 to 1825 by the Russian architect Joseph Bové, who clothed it in its Neoclassical exterior, an order of Roman Doric columns enclosing bays of arch-headed windows in a blind arcade, painted white and cream yellow. The roof, with its internal rafters and beams exposed, rests on external columns of the Manege. 

The structure was used first as a traditional &quot;manège&quot;, an indoor riding academy, to house parades of horsemen and a training school for officers. The long Manege was large enough to hold an entire infantry regiment—over two thousand soldiers—as well as an invited audience. Since 1831 it has been an exhibition place. In 1867, Hector Berlioz and Nikolai Rubinstein performed at the Manege before a crowd of 12,000. During the Soviet years, the building was used as an art gallery. It was there that Nikita Khrushchev chided avant-garde artists for promoting degenerate art, an episode known as the Manege Affair.

==2004 fire==
On 14 March 2004, the night of a Russian presidential election in which Vladimir Putin was overwhelmingly re-elected for a second four-year term, the building caught fire and burnt down, killing two firefighters. The wooden beams and rafters collapsed, leaving the walls remaining on site. The official investigation concluded that a short circuit caused the fire, though there was media speculation that a fire at such a historic building, only a stone&#x27;s throw from the Kremlin, on the night of a presidential election, may not have been coincidental. On 18 February 2005 the restored Manege resumed its operation as an exhibition hall by mounting the same exposition that had been scheduled for the day of the fire.

== Description and architectural features ==
The Rectangular in plan one-storey building of the Moscow Manege is an example of Classicism architecture. The building was 166 m long, 44 m wide and about 15 m high. The original floor area of the Manege was 7,424.67 m ². The facades of the building have an arcade of seven arched apertures with semi-columns and are crowned with plain gables without decorations. The side walls are flanked by semi-columns of the Tuscan order, between which vaulted windows are placed in the arched openings. Under the gables of the facades as well as in the middle part of the side walls there are three wooden gates. The main facade was supposed to be the Southern one facing the Kutafya Tower - one of the four entrances to the Kremlin. The internal space of the Manege was well illuminated by the daylight owing to the windows which formed about one third of the area of the walls. The Manege&#x27;s enlarged proportions, columns, pylons and restrained colour scheme underscore the monumentality of the building.
