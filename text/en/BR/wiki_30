<text>The Entlebucher Sennenhund or Entlebucher Mountain Dog is a medium-sized herding dog, it is the smallest of the four regional breeds that constitute the Sennenhund dog type. The name Sennenhund refers to people called &quot;Senn&quot;, herders in the Swiss Alps. Entlebuch is a region in the canton of Lucerne in Switzerland. 

The breed is also known in English as the Entelbuch Mountain Dog, Entelbucher Cattle Dog, and similar combinations.

== History ==

The Entlebucher is the smallest of four Swiss mountain dogs, the others being the Appenzeller Sennenhund, the Bernese Mountain Dog, and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. During the 1800s these dogs were variable and were not regarded as distinct breeds. In 1908 the Swiss Kennel Club set about classifying them. 

In 1913, four bobtail Entlebucher Sennenhund were shown to Albert Heim, an advocate for the increasingly rare Sennenhund breeds. The breed was entered into the Swiss Kennel Club stud book, but World War I intervened, and at first, after the war, no examples of the breed could be found. 

The first breed club was not formed until 1926, 16 dogs of the type were found in 1927, and the breed slowly was restored. Although originally kept for guarding and herding, today the breed is usually kept as a lively companion.
=== Four breeds of Sennenhund ===
The four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name followed by the most popular English version of the breed name, are:
* Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog
* Berner Sennenhund, Bernese Mountain Dog
* Appenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller Mountain Dog
* Entlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher Mountain Dog

The Entlebucher breed shares many characteristics of other livestock guardian dogs from around the world.

==Appearance==

The female Entlebucher Sennenhund is a square; the male is a longer, less square, sturdy, medium-sized dog. It has small, triangular ears and rather small brown eyes. The head is well proportioned to the body, with a strong flat skull. The long jaw is well formed and powerful. The feet are compact, supporting its muscular body. The smooth coat is close and smooth with symmetrical markings of black, tan, and white. This tricolor coat has white on its toes, tail-tip, and the chest and blaze where the fur is soft and fluffy; the tan always lies between the black and the white. It has muscular, broad hips. The hocks are naturally well angled. The tail is sometimes docked, a practice which is now prohibited by law in many countries, or it may have a natural bobtail. Height at the withers is 19-20 ins (48–50 cm) and weight is 45-65 lbs (20–30 kg).

==Temperament==
As with all large, active working dogs, this breed should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people, and be provided with regular activity and training. Temperament of individual dogs may vary. The Standard says that the breed is &quot;good-natured and devoted towards people familiar to him, slightly suspicious of strangers.&quot;

==Kennel club recognition==
The Entlebucher Sennenhund is recognised internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, using the standard written in the breed&#x27;s native Switzerland. Other national kennel clubs not affiliated with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale also recognise the breed, often writing their own versions of the breed standard.

The Entlebucher is recognised by The Kennel Club (UK) and the Canadian Kennel Club and placed in the Working Group. The United States Kennel Club (US) places the breed in the Herding Group. It is not yet recognised by the New Zealand Kennel Club or the Australian National Kennel Council. The breed is recognised by numerous small clubs and internet-based registries, where it is promoted as a rare breed for puppy buyers seeking a unique pet.

The breed was accepted into the American Kennel Club Stud Book on December 1, 2010 and became eligible to compete in the herding dog group on January 1, 2011.

==Health issues==
Inbreeding due to the small foundation stock numbers has led to Entlebuchers suffering from congenital defects, the most common of which is hip dysplasia. Hemolytic anemia also is known to occur. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is also present in the breed. The National Entlebucher Mountain Dog Association (NEMDA), in collaboration with other organizations, is working to eliminate these issues from the breed through responsible breeding, genetic testing, and fact dissemination.

<text>Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, (December 5, 1829 – November 16, 1908) lawyer, businessman and politician served as the fourth premier of Quebec, a federal Cabinet minister, and the seventh Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, PC was born as Henry-Gustave Joly in Épernay, France. His father&#x27;s family was one of the traditional Huguenot families from Switzerland and his mother&#x27;s family was Roman Catholic. Initially a Huguenot himself, Henri-Gustave converted to Anglicanism before he married in 1856.

His father, Gaspard-Pierre-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, was a pioneer of early photography (the first man to photograph the Acropolis, in 1839) who made a series of daguerreotypes while on a Grand Tour through Greece, Egypt and the Holy Land.

Henri-Gustave&#x27;s mother was Julie-Christine, the youngest daughter of Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière, who inherited the seigneury of Lotbinière, in 1828. His parents&#x27; marriage was not a happy one, which is perhaps not surprising as his father had first proposed to Julie-Christine&#x27;s eldest sister, Louise-Josephe, the Seigneuresse de Vaudreuil, who instead chose to marry Robert Unwin Harwood.

Henri-Gustave Joly studied in Paris from 1836 to 1849, obtaining his &quot;bachelier ès lettres&quot; from the Sorbonne. He returned to Canada in 1850 and was called to the bar in 1855. Joly inherited the lands and title of seigneur of Lotbinière in 1860.

=== Family ===

Joly married Margaretta-Josepha Gowen (25 July 1837 – 14 August 1904), daughter of Hammond Gowen of Quebec, and was the father of eleven children, of whom seven (four girls and three boys) reached adulthood. Their daughter, Margaretta-Anna, married Brigadier-General Herbert Colborne Nanton (1863–1935), brother of Augustus Meredith Nanton. His son, Edmond-Gustave Joly de Lotbinère inherited the seigneury of Lotbinière in 1908. Sir Henri-Gustave was the grandfather of Seymour de Lotbiniere, Director of the British Broadcasting Corporation from 1935 to 1940.

=== Provincial political career ===
Joly was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Lotbinière in 1861 as a Bleu, a moderate liberal, but was a member of the more radical Parti rouge when re-elected in 1863.

Henri-Gustave Joly became Leader of the Quebec Liberals at the time of Confederation in 1867, and was the member for the federal riding of Lotbinière. He was re-elected in Lotbinière in the Canadian Election of 1872.

In 1878, Conservative premier Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville resigned on March 2 since he was about to be deposed by Lieutenant Governor Luc Letellier de Saint-Just. They had a conflict over railroad legislation which de Saint-Just deemed unconstitutional. As a result, Joly became Premier on March 8, 1878, and the first Liberal to become Premier of Quebec. To this day, he remains the only foreign-born and Protestant to be the Leader of the Province of Quebec.

In the May 1, 1878 election, the Liberals won one fewer seat than the Conservatives (there were also two independent Conservatives). However, Joly remained in power in a minority government for about a year and half. His government was brought down by a motion of censure involving the defection of five Liberals (including future premier Edmund James Flynn) to the Conservatives. The Leader of the Opposition Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau was called to form a government on October 31, 1879.

Joly remained Liberal Party leader until 1883. In all, he spent about 17 years as Liberal leader, but served only briefly as Premier.

In 1883, Joly resigned as Liberal leader to make way for Honoré Mercier. He resigned as member of the Legislative Assembly in November 1885.

He added &quot;de Lotbinière&quot; (part of his mother&#x27;s maiden name) to his name in 1888.

=== Careers in federal politics and in forestry ===

Joly de Lotbinière was once again elected to the federal House of Commons in the 1896 federal election, this time as the member from Portneuf. He served as a federal Cabinet minister from 1897 until he retired in 1900.

In March 1900 Sir Henri was invited along with J. R. Booth, William Little, Thomas Southworth and Dr. William Saunders by Elihu Stewart, Canada&#x27;s chief inspector of timber and forestry, to create the Canadian Forestry Association. On 8 March 1900, these men met in the Railway Committee Room of the House of Commons in Ottawa, playing host to lumbermen, foresters, civil servants, railroad executives and others, all concerned about the survival and future use of Canada&#x27;s forests. The CFA was truly a national organization, with representation from every province and the districts of Assiniboia, Athabaska, Keewatin and Yukon.

Under the chairmanship of Sir Henri, delegates approved bylaws and a constitution of the Canadian Forestry Association, Canada&#x27;s oldest conservation organization. These early conservationists recognized that the whole field of renewable resources, the forests, waters, wildlife, soils and recreational values, were closely interrelated. The CFA&#x27;s mission continues to be to promote the protection and wise use of Canada&#x27;s forest, water and wildlife resources. His participation as the first president of the Canadian Forestry Association was not altered by his ongoing political activity. He continued to put forward new ideas for forestry. In 1906 the CFA convened Canada&#x27;s first national forestry convention, chaired by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, honorary CFA President. Sir Henri presented a paper in that called for the forest sector to consider conversion to the metric measurement system, a change that would not come to fruition in Canada until the 1980s.

At the 1905 annual meeting of the Canadian Forestry Association in Quebec City, condolences were expressed to Sir Henri on the passing the previous year of his wife. To quote the proceedings: &quot;Then we must all regret the affliction that has come to our honoured president, Sir Henri Joly de Lotbinière and his family in the death of Lady Joly. We all love Sir Henri, and we believe that his name will be remembered for the good work he has done as long as trees grow in this country. He has our sincere sympathy in the affliction that has befallen him.&quot;

Prime Minister Laurier appointed him Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia in 1900; he served until 1906. He died in Quebec City in 1908, and was buried in Mount Hermon Cemetery in Sillery, on 18 November 1908.

==Elections as party leader==

He won the 1878 election (the Liberals won one fewer seat than the Conservatives but he remained premier with the support of a few Conservatives). He lost the 1881 election.

<text>Vice-Admiral Sir Humphrey Thomas Walwyn, (25 January 1879 – 29 December 1957) was an officer of the Royal Navy, who served during the Second Boer War and First World War, and was the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Indian Navy from 1928 until his retirement in 1934. He then served as Governor of Newfoundland from 1936, throughout the Second World War, until 1946.

==Naval career==
Walwyn joined the Royal Navy in 1893, spending two years training in the training ship &quot;Britannia&quot; before joining the battleship . He served as acting sub-lieutenant from December 1898, and was confirmed in this rank on 7 February 1900, when he was posted to the pre-dreadnought battleship , serving in the Mediterranean Fleet. Later that year he was promoted to lieutenant on 15 December 1900, seeing action in the Second Boer War.

In 1902 Walwyn was posted to , the Naval Gunnery School at Whale Island, Hampshire, to train as a Gunnery Lieutenant. Upon qualifying he was appointed to the school&#x27;s staff for six months. From 1905 he served as Gunnery Lieutenant in the cruiser and the battleships and . He also spent 18 months on the staff of the Inspector of Target Practice at the Admiralty. He was promoted to the rank of commander on 1 July 1912.

Walwyn was then appointed an Assistant to the Director of Naval Ordnance at the Admiralty, remaining in that post into the first year of the First World War, finally returning to sea duty in 1915 as Commander (Second-in-Command) of the new battleship . There he saw action in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, and was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 15 September. He was promoted to captain on 31 December 1916, and in June 1917, was awarded the Order of St. Stanislas, 2nd Class (with Swords) by Russia.

Walwyn was appointed commander of the first class protected cruiser on 17 January 1919, and, from 29 April 1920, he commanded the destroyer leader , also serving as Captain (D), 2nd Destroyer Flotilla.

He oversaw the change of the Royal Indian Marine to the Royal Indian Navy in October 1934, of which he was the first Flag Officer Commanding, but retired in November 1934 after only a month. He was placed on the Retired List on 15 December 1934.

<text>Sir Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau (; November 9, 1840 – June 13, 1898), born in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec, was a French-Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 7th Lieutenant Governor of Quebec from 1892 to 1898.

==Life==

As a lawyer, he defended Ambroise-Dydime Lépine against the charge of murdering Thomas Scott during the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870.

He served as the fifth premier of Quebec, federal Cabinet minister, and the seventh lieutenant governor of Quebec.

After the 1878 Quebec election, he was the Leader of the Opposition. He became premier in 1879 after the fall of the minority government of Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière. He won the 1881 election, but resigned on July 29, 1882, to seek election to the federal House of Commons. He won a by-election held on August 16, 1882.

Chapleau planned to quit politics in 1885 when Louis Riel was sentenced to be hanged but decided to stay, fearing it would only inflame the situation. After Riel was hanged, he was attacked by Quebecers who accused him of the death of Riel along with John A. Macdonald.

He served as Minister of Justice under prime ministers John A. Macdonald and John Abbott, but declined to serve under John Thompson. He resigned in 1892, and was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Quebec from December 1892 until January 1898. He died in June of that same year in Montreal, Quebec. His funeral monument can be seen at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery.

==Elections as party leader==
He won the 1881 election.

==Family==
On November 25, 1874, he married Marie Louise, daughter of Lieutenant-colonel Charles King of Sherbrooke in the province of Quebec.

== Electoral record ==

Note: popular vote is compared to vote in 1882 general election.

<doc id="517107" wikidata="Q451326" url="?curid=517107" title="Doris Troy">
<text>Doris Troy (born Doris Elaine Higginsen; January 6, 1937 – February 16, 2004) was an American R&amp;B singer and songwriter, known to her fans as &quot;Mama Soul&quot;. Her biggest hit was &quot;Just One Look&quot;, a top 10 hit in 1963.

==Life and career==
She was born as Doris Elaine Higginsen, in the Bronx, the daughter of a Barbadian Pentecostal minister. She later took her grandmother&#x27;s name and grew up as Doris Payne. Her parents disapproved of &quot;subversive&quot; forms of music like rhythm &amp; blues, so she cut her teeth singing in her father&#x27;s choir. At age 16, she was working as an usherette at the Apollo where she was discovered by James Brown. Under the name Doris Payne, she began songwriting and earned $100 in 1960 for the Dee Clark hit &quot;How About That&quot;.

Going into the recording industry, Troy worked as a backup vocalist for Atlantic Records alongside Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick. She was also part of the original lineup of The Sweet Inspirations in 1963, with Cissy Houston and the two Warwicks, who were Houston&#x27;s nieces. Taking her stage name from Helen of Troy, Troy sang backup vocals for Solomon Burke, the Drifters, Houston, and Dionne Warwick, before she co-wrote and recorded &quot;Just One Look&quot; (the songwriting credits use the name Doris Payne). This song hit No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1963.

&quot;Just One Look&quot; was the only charting US hit for Troy. The song was recorded in 10 minutes in October 1962, with producer Buddy Lucas, as a demo for Atlantic Records. However, after Atlantic Records heard the demo, they decided not to re-record it, instead releasing it unchanged. The musicians included Ernie Hayes on organ, Wally Richardson on guitar, Bob Bushnell on bass, and Bernard &quot;Pretty&quot; Purdie on drums. The song has been covered by The Hollies, Faith, Hope &amp; Charity, Major Lance, Linda Ronstadt, Bryan Ferry, Anne Murray, Klaus Nomi, and Harry Nilsson in a duet with Lynda Laurence. Troy&#x27;s only foray into the UK Singles Chart, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot;, peaked at No. 37 in December 1964.

In 1968, her single &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; was released in the UK on the Toast label. It was reviewed by Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; Hite of Canned Heat in the &quot;Blind Date&quot; section of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Hite said that he wasn&#x27;t a fan of records with big symphony backings.

After moving to London in 1969, she was signed by The Beatles to their Apple Records label, and released the &quot;Doris Troy&quot; album the following year, co-produced by Troy and George Harrison. Troy worked in the UK throughout the 1970s, appearing at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Club and recording a live album, &quot;The Rainbow Testament&quot;. Neither &quot;The Rainbow Testament&quot; nor her People Records album, &quot;Stretching Out&quot;, sold well.

As her solo career peaked, she continued to sing back-up for multiple artists and bands. She contributed vocals to The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1968 song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;, Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, and Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;. In addition, she also sang for Humble Pie, Kevin Ayers, Edgar Broughton, George Harrison, Johnny Hallyday, Vivian Stanshall, Dusty Springfield, Nick Drake, and Junior Campbell.

In 1974, Troy moved from England back to the United States, where she played casinos and nightclubs.

&quot;Mama, I Want to Sing&quot; is a stage musical based on her life, and was co-written with her sister, Vy Higginsen, a popular New York City radio personality. It ran for 1,500 performances at the Heckscher Theatre in Spanish Harlem. Troy played her own mother, Geraldine. Chaka Khan played her aunt in the London production, as did Deniece Williams. &quot;Mama, I Want to Sing!&quot; was also made into a motion picture, starring Ciara, Patti LaBelle, and Hill Harper, which was released on DVD in 2012.

Troy died from emphysema at her home in Las Vegas, Nevada, aged 67.

<doc id="517109" wikidata="Q7520751" url="?curid=517109" title="Simple Simon (nursery rhyme)">
<text>&quot;Simple Simon&quot; is an English language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19777.

==Lyrics==

The rhyme is as follows;

:Simple Simon met a pieman,
:Going to the fair;
:Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
:Let me taste your ware.

:Said the pieman to Simple Simon,
:Show me first your penny;
:Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
:Indeed I have not any.

:Simple Simon went a-fishing, 
:For to catch a whale;
:All the water he had got,
:Was in his mother&#x27;s pail.

:Simple Simon went to look
:If plums grew on a thistle;
:He pricked his fingers very much,
:Which made poor Simon whistle.

:He went for water in a sieve
:But soon it all fell through
:And now poor Simple Simon
:Bids you all adieu!

==Origin==
The verses used today are the first of a longer chapbook history first published in 1764. The character of Simple Simon may have been in circulation much longer, possibly through an Elizabethan chapbook and in a ballad, &quot;Simple Simon&#x27;s Misfortunes and his Wife Margery&#x27;s Cruelty&quot;, from about 1685. A possible inspiration is Simon Edy, a beggar of the St Giles area in the 18th century.

<text>Simple Simon is a Broadway musical with book by Guy Bolton, and Ed Wynn, lyrics by Lorenz Hart, music by Richard Rodgers, produced by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., and starring Ed Wynn.

It originally played from February 18, 1930, to June 14, 1930, at the Ziegfeld Theatre, then reopened on March 9, 1931, at the Majestic Theatre.

The play, a loose plot designed to show off Ed Wynn&#x27;s fumbling, clowning, punning style, cast him as a newspaper vendor who spends his time in a fairy-tale land where bad news does not exist. The song &quot;Ten Cents a Dance&quot; was introduced by Ruth Etting in this show. &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; by Gus Kahn and Walter Donaldson was interpolated into the show about two months after it opened.

&quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot;, cut during the Broadway previews, was eventually sung by Jessie Matthews in the London production of &quot;Ever Green&quot;, and became a standard.

The musical numbers written for the show included:
*&quot;Coney Island&quot;
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Your Folks&quot;
*&quot;Magic Music&quot;
*&quot;I Still Believe in You&quot;
*&quot;Send for Me&quot;
*&quot;Dull and Gay&quot;
*&quot;Sweetenheart&quot;
*&quot;Hunting the Fox&quot;
*&quot;Come On, Men&quot;
*&quot;Ten Cents a Dance&quot;
*&quot;Rags and Tatters&quot;
*&quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot; (dropped before the New York opening)
*&quot;He Was Too Good to Me&quot; (dropped before the New York opening)
*&quot;Oh, So Lovely&quot; (unused)
*&quot;Peter Pan&quot;
*&quot;The Simple Simon Instep&quot; (unused)
*&quot;Prayers of Tears and Laughter&quot; (dropped before the New York opening)
*&quot;Hunting Song&quot; (unused)
*&quot;Come out of the Nursery&quot; (dropped before the pre-Broadway tryout)
*&quot;Sing Glory Hallelujah&quot; (dropped before the pre-Broadway tryout)

The song &quot;I Can Do Wonders with You&quot;, from a previous show, was interpolated.

<text>Joseph-Alfred Mousseau (July 17, 1837 – March 30, 1886), was a Canadian lawyer and politician, who served in the federal Cabinet and also as the sixth premier of Quebec.

== Biography ==
He was born in Sainte-Geneviève-de-Berthier, Lower Canada, the son of Louis Mousseau, the son of Alexis Mousseau, and Sophie Duteau, dit Grandpré. Mousseau was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative Member of Parliament in the 1874 election for the riding of Bagot, and was re-elected three times. In 1880, he was elevated to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, serving first as president of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council of Canada, and then as Secretary of State for Canada.

Exchanging places with Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Mousseau left federal politics to become the sixth Premier of the province of Quebec from July 31, 1882. He served until his resignation on January 22, 1884, after being appointed as a puisne judge of the Superior Court for the district of Rimouski. He died in Montreal in 1886.

His brother Joseph Octave Mousseau was also a member of the Canadian House of Commons.

<doc id="517115" wikidata="Q443886" url="?curid=517115" title="Alton Ellis">
<text>Alton Nehemiah Ellis (1 September 1938 – 10 October 2008) was a Jamaican singer-songwriter. One of the innovators of rocksteady, he was given the informal title &quot;Godfather of Rocksteady&quot;. In 2006, he was inducted into the International Reggae And World Music Awards Hall Of Fame.

==Early life==
Born Alton Nehemiah Ellis in Trenchtown, Kingston, Jamaica, Ellis was raised within a musical family which included his older brothers Leslie [who performed as one of his back up singers and co-wrote some of his songs], and Irving [known as &#x27;Niney&#x27;] who was a popular singer and steel pan player on Jamaica&#x27;s North Coast. He learned to play the piano at a young age. He attended Ebeneezer and Boys&#x27; Town schools, where he excelled in both music and sport. While at Boys&#x27; Town Ellis performed as a dancer (in a duo) in the first show that a school director called Mr Bailey had organized for Vere Johns who had been invited down to talent scout. He would later compete on Vere Johns&#x27; &quot;Opportunity Hour&quot;. After winning some competitions, he switched to singing, starting his career in 1959 as part of the duo Alton &amp; Eddy with Eddy Parkins.

==Career==
===Rhythm and blues===
Ellis and Parkins recorded for Coxsone Dodd at Studio One, initially in the R&amp;B style, having a hit in 1960 with &quot;Muriel&quot; (from Dodd&#x27;s first commercially oriented recording session at Federal studios), a song Ellis had written while working as a labourer on a building site. This initial success was followed by the release of &quot;My Heaven&quot;, which like &quot;Muriel&quot; was a slow R&amp;B ballad with the instrumental triplets and vocal harmonizing common to the ballads of that period. Further releases in the R&amp;B style followed: &quot;Lullabye Angel&quot;, &quot;I Know It All&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Never Gonna Cry&quot; and &quot;Yours&quot;. The duo also recorded R&amp;B tracks for Vincent Chin&#x27;s Randy&#x27;s label including &quot;Let Me Dream&quot;. The duo split after Parkins won a major talent contest and moved to the United States. Ellis remained in Kingston, working as a printer and after losing his job, he restarted his music career, initially forming a new duo with John Holt. When Holt joined The Paragons, Ellis formed a new group, The Flames. Ellis continued to work for Dodd and also recorded for his arch-rival, Duke Reid on his Treasure Isle label. At the start of his career Ellis recorded with his younger sister Hortense; early tracks with Hortense like &quot;Don&#x27;t Gamble With Love&quot; (1965) were still in the R&amp;B style.

===Ska and rocksteady===
By the mid-1960s, ska was moving on and the beat was slowing down to rocksteady and becoming associated with the violent rude boy subculture in Jamaican dancehalls. Many artists made records referring to the rude boys, including Ellis, although his records were consistently anti-rudie, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Trouble People&quot;, &quot;Dance Crasher&quot;, and &quot;Cry Tough&quot;. Releasing records under the name Alton Ellis and The Flames (the varying line-up of which included his brother Leslie Ellis, David &quot;Baby G&quot; Gordon and Winston Jarrett); the group had hits with &quot;Girl I&#x27;ve Got a Date&quot; and &quot;Cry Tough&quot;.

&quot;Girl I&#x27;ve Got a Date&quot; recorded with Gladstone Anderson on piano, Paul Douglas on drums, Hux Brown on rhythm guitar, Lynn Taitt on guitar, and Jackie Jackson on bass is considered one of the foundational songs of the rocksteady genre. The bass line of &quot;Girl I&#x27;ve Got a Date&quot; was allegedly duplicated in other international hits &quot;The Liquidator&quot; (Harry J Allstars and &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot; (The Staple Singers).

The release of &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (1967) backed by Tommy McCook and the Supersonics, the first song to refer to the name of the new genre, heralded the new direction Jamaican popular music was taking. Ellis continued to have hits for Treasure Isle; working with artists such as Lloyd Charmers, Phyllis Dillon and The Heptones. His &quot;Mr Soul of Jamaica&quot; album (with Tommy McCook and the Supersonics) is regarded as one of the definitive rocksteady albums.

Ellis toured the United Kingdom in the 1967 with Ken Boothe and Studio One session band the Soul Vendors and on his return to Jamaica he worked with Dodd, recording the tracks that would be released as his debut album &quot;Alton Ellis Sings Rock &amp; Soul&quot;. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ellis recorded for some of Jamaica&#x27;s top producers including Bunny Lee, Keith Hudson, and Herman Chin Loy. He also began to produce his own records, including &quot;My Time Is The Right Time&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Message&quot;. He had two hits with Lloyd Daley in &quot;Deliver Us&quot; (1970) and &quot;Back to Africa&quot; (1971), both released in the UK on the Gas record label, a subsidiary of Pama Records.

Ellis regularly returned to England, working with several London-based producers and after spending a few years in Canada, from 1972 he based himself permanently in the UK. Ellis continued to record and perform regularly, recording in the early 1980s for emerging producers including Henry &quot;Junjo&quot; Lawes, Sugar Minott, and King Jammy. He also opened up the &quot;All-Tone&quot; record shop in South London, and started a record label of the same name.

Ellis continued to be active on the reggae scene until his health began to deteriorate. His latest works include performing all over Europe with a French backing-band called ASPO (About Some Precioux Oldies) at the beginning of the 21st century. Recorded in Bordeaux, France, &quot;Live with Aspo: Workin&#x27; on a Groovy Thing&quot; is the only live album Alton Ellis ever released (2001).

In 2004, Ellis was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government in recognition of his achievements.

In December 2007, he was admitted to hospital in London for treatment of cancer of the lymph glands (Hodgkins disease), but he returned to live performance after receiving chemotherapy.

Ellis died of cancer on 10 October 2008 at Hammersmith Hospital, London. His death prompted a statement from Jamaica&#x27;s Minister of Information, Culture, Youth and Sports, Olivia &quot;Babsy&quot; Grange, who said &quot;even as we mourn the great Alton Ellis, we must give thanks for his monumental contribution to the development of Jamaica&#x27;s popular music&quot;. A funeral service and celebration of his life was held on 3 November, attended by family, fans, music industry personnel and government ministers, with tribute performances from stars including Mr. Fix It Winston Francis, Tinga Stewart, George Nooks, Tony Gregory, Ken Boothe, Judy Mowatt and Carlene Davis.

In 2012 it was announced that the main hall of the new Trench Town Multi-Purpose Building would be named the Alton Ellis Auditorium in his honour.

He was the older brother of the late Hortense Ellis, and the father of more than twenty children, including Noel Ellis and Christopher Ellis, who are both reggae singers. He was also the uncle of the Jamaican comedians Owen &quot;Blakka&quot; Ellis and Ian &quot;Ity&quot; Ellis.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Mad Mad&quot; riddim (the track &quot;Mad Mad&quot; by Alton Ellis and the Sound Dimension band was released in 1968 on the Coxsone label) has been reused or sampled by many hip-hop, dancehall and reggae producers and artists. The recognizable three-note descending horn line was reinterpreted by Henry &quot;Junjo&quot; Lawes, and eventually became known as the &quot;Diseases&quot; reggae riddim. &quot;Diseases&quot; is notably used in Yellowman&#x27;s hit song &quot;Zungguzungguguzungguzeng&quot;, which has in turn has been sampled and reinterpreted by a long list of popular hip-hop artists, including KRS-One, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Sublime, and Blackstar. This constant reinterpretation and referencing has made Ellis a major but little-known influence in the trajectory of dancehall, reggae and hip hop.

<doc id="517117" wikidata="Q22082217" url="?curid=517117" title="National redoubt">
<text>A national redoubt or national fortress is an area to which the (remnant) military forces of a nation can be withdrawn if the main battle has been lost or even earlier if defeat is considered inevitable. Typically, a region is chosen with a geography favouring defence, such as a mountainous area or a peninsula, to function as a final holdout to preserve national independence and host an effective resistance movement for the duration of the conflict.

==Western Europe==
===Belgium===

From the middle of the 19th century until 1914 the fortress city of Antwerp was the official National Redoubt of Antwerp in Belgium.

Fortress Antwerp was a defensive belt of fortifications built in two rings to defend Antwerp. Antwerp was designated to be a national redoubt ( or ) in case Belgium was attacked. It was built in the period 1859–1914. In total it encompasses a belt of fortifications of 95 km. During the 1914 Siege of Antwerp it held out for 12 days.

===France===
In 1940 Brittany was briefly considered a national redoubt in the last stages of the Battle of France, but proved impractical.

===Netherlands===
Until 1920, the &quot;Fortress Amsterdam&quot; was the national redoubt of the Netherlands. Between 1920 and 1940, Fortress Amsterdam was extended to Fortress Holland, to include a larger part of the country&#x27;s heartland. In both cases, neither &quot;redoubt&quot; proved defensible even though the Dutch Water Line, a precursor in the Netherlands, managed to stop the advances of the French troops in the &quot;Rampjaar&quot; 1672, providing the Dutch with the needed time to gain the upper hand.

===Portugal===

From the early 19th century to World War II, Lisbon was considered the national redoubt of Portugal. Besides being the capital, the largest city and the major port of the country, Lisbon was considered the last defensible redoubt in case of an invasion of Portugal by a major power. During this period, successive systems of defense were implemented.

The first major defense system of Lisbon was built during the Peninsular War, as the Lines of Torres Vedras. These consisted in two lines of fortifications that protected the region of Lisbon (with a third line around the coastal fortress of São Julião da Barra). The Lines of Torres Vedras were able to block Masséna&#x27;s 1810 offensive.

Another major defense system was implemented in the late 19th century as the Lisbon Entrenched Camp. This was a modern (for its day) system of fortifications, aimed to protect the Portuguese capital against an attack coming from land or from the sea. Its land component sector consisted in several modern forts, connected by protected roads and telegraph lines. Its sea front defense consisted in coastal artillery batteries, complemented by naval dedicated assets, including a coastal battleship, torpedo boats, submarines and naval mines.

The last major system of defense of Lisbon was implemented during World War II. It included a system of anti-aircraft, ground, coastal and maritime defenses. Parts of this system, namely its fortified coastal defense batteries remained partially active until the late 1990s.

===Sweden===
Karlsborg Fortress was conceived in 19th century Sweden to host the monarchy, government, parliament and gold reserves in time of war. Karlsborg was selected as Sweden&#x27;s eastern coast and Stockholm became rather exposed after Sweden&#x27;s loss of Finland in 1809.

==Central Europe==

===Germany===
The Alpine Fortress () was the World War II national redoubt planned by Heinrich Himmler in November/December 1943 for Germany&#x27;s government and armed forces to retreat to an area from &quot;southern Bavaria across western Austria to northern Italy&quot;. The plan was never fully endorsed by Hitler and no serious attempt was made to put the plan into operation. It did, however, serve as an effective propaganda tool and ruse of war in the closing months of the conflict, with considerable Allied resources diverted southwards towards the capture of the purported redoubt which ultimately turned out to be a phantom.

=== Italy ===

The Valtellina Redoubt (&quot;Ridotto Alpino Repubblicano&quot;, Republican Alpine Redoubt, or RAR) was intended to be a stronghold in the Valtellina, a valley in the Italian Alps, where the Italian fascist regime would make its last stand at the end of World War II. Because of a lack of planning and preparatory work, it was never used.

===Switzerland===

Swiss National Redoubt (&quot;Schweizer Alpenfestung&quot; or &quot;Réduit suisse&quot;) was a defensive plan developed by the Swiss government during World War II to respond to a possible German invasion, which had been planned but was never carried out.

The plan was in three stages: first, to hold an invading army on the border; second, if that failed, to launch a delaying war that would allow the bulk of Swiss forces to withdraw to a defensible perimeter in the Swiss Alps; and third, to defend that mountain stronghold.

===Austria===
During the Cold War, Austria developed a similar plan called &quot;Raumverteidigung&quot; (area defence). The plan was primarily directed against Hungary and Czechoslovakia (and later the entire Warsaw Pact) but it also included plans against an attack by NATO forces. The Austrian Armed Forces would retreat into key zones situated in the alpine region and defend it. They would also employ guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and delay the enemy advance in the area&#x27;s security zones.

==Other regions==
===China===
During the Second Sino-Japanese War in World War II, the city of Kunming was prepared as a national redoubt in case the temporary capital, Chongqing, fell. An elaborate system of caves to serve as offices, barracks and factories was prepared but never used.

Kunming was again slated to serve in this role in the renewed Chinese Civil War, but the Nationalist garrison changed sides and joined the Communists. Instead, Taiwan became the last redoubt and home of the Nationalist government, a role which continues to this day.

===Japan===
Towards the end of World War II, the Matsushiro Underground Imperial Headquarters were built in Nagano Prefecture. They were intended as a base from which the Japanese government could operate in case of an Allied invasion of the home islands. The base was partly completed by the time of Japan&#x27;s surrender.

===Mandate of Palestine===
As German Afrika Korps forces proceeded eastward towards Egypt in the North African campaign of World War II, the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine considered retreating into fortified positions at Haifa and the Mount Carmel region, were the German advance to reach them. The Palestine Post Occupation Scheme was a short-lived 1942 collaboration between the Jewish underground Palmach and the British Special Operations Executive, with training for the plan centered at the kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek, and Moshe Dayan to be put in charge of managing a clandestine radio network.

In Jewish underground circles, the plan was also variously called the &quot;Plan for the North&quot;, &quot;Masada on the Carmel&quot;, &quot;Haifa-Tobruk&quot;, &quot;Haifa-Masada-Musa-Dagh&quot;, or &quot;Haifa Stronghold&quot;. The planners on the Palmach side were Yohanan Ratner and Yitzhak Sadeh. David Shaltiel (commander in Haifa at the time) and Yitzhak Gruenbaum were vocal supporters of a Masada-like stand, while Yigal Allon and others were skeptical of its usefulness. The evacuation of women and children to Cyprus was also considered.

The decisive British victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein soon afterward rendered the plan moot.

===Poland===
During the 1930s, assuming that Poland would be attacked only by Germany, the Polish forces were to make the last stand in the area of the Romanian Bridgehead. After the Battle of Bzura was over and even after the Soviet invasion of Poland, many Polish divisions kept on heading towards the Romanian Bridgehead. Beck&#x27;s proposal to establish Lviv (Lwów) as the temporary capital of Poland, in the case of German attack, was rejected; possibly because Lviv was west of the Romanian Bridgehead.

===South Korea===
===Yugoslavia===
According to the &quot;Total National Resistance&quot; defense doctrine of Yugoslavia, a rugged highland area focused on central Bosnia (roughly, the Lašva Valley) was to function as a redoubt to which the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army would retreat in case of a Soviet or NATO invasion. Defense of the rest of the country was to be left to the guerrilla-warfare efforts of the Territorial Defense Forces. A network of industrial zones and fortified bases was developed in anticipation, including factories in boom cities like Zenica and an underground air force base at Željava and a command bunker complex intended for the use by Marshal Josip Broz Tito and the rest of the Yugoslav leadership.

<doc id="517119" wikidata="Q333437" url="?curid=517119" title="Gordon Macdonald, 1st Baron Macdonald of Gwaenysgor">
<text>Gordon Macdonald, 1st Baron Macdonald of Gwaenysgor (27 May 1888 – 20 January 1966), was a British Labour Party politician and Newfoundland&#x27;s final British governor as well as the last chairman of the Commission of Government serving from 1946 until the dominion joined Confederation in 1949 and became a province of Canada.

==Early life==
Macdonald was born in Gwaenysgor, near Prestatyn, Flintshire, Wales. His birth was registered (as Gordon McDonald) in Holywell in the third quarter of 1888. His father, Thomas Macdonald, and his mother, Ellen, were both Welsh. The family moved to the Lancashire Coalfield where he was brought up, his father working as a coalminer in a pit near Ashton in Makerfield. Educated in a local elementary school, he initially followed his father into the collieries aged 13. He subsequently won a scholarship to Ruskin College.

In 1920 he was elected to Wigan Board of Guardians, in 1924 became president of a local co-operative society and in the same year a miner&#x27;s agent for the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain.

==Member of Parliament==

At the 1929 general election Macdonald was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Ince, holding the seat until 1942. He was a junior Labour whip from 1931 to 1934 and was chairman of committees in the House of Commons. He resigned from Parliament in July 1942 to take up the post of Regional Controller for the Ministry of Fuel and Power for the Lancashire, Cheshire, and North Wales Region.

==Governor of Newfoundland==
In January 1946 he was appointed Governor of Newfoundland and Commander in Chief of Newfoundland and its Dependencies, and chairman of the unelected Commission of Government that governed the dominion. At the same time he was created Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. He oversaw the election of the Newfoundland National Convention in 1946, and the holding of two referendums in 1948, which led to Newfoundland becoming a province of Canada in March 1949.

Macdonald was viewed as being pro-federation and was accused of bias by Peter Cashin and supporters of responsible government and of manipulating the referendums.

Macdonald left the island upon its entry to Canada in 1949. Two days after his departure, an apparently congratulatory poem was published in &quot;The Evening Telegram&quot;. It emerged that the poem was an acrostic, with the first letter of each line spelling out &quot;THE BASTARD&quot;.

==Paymaster-General==
On return to the United Kingdom in 1949, Macdonald joined the government of Clement Attlee as Paymaster General, elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Macdonald of Gwaenysgor. In 1950 he was leader of the British delegation to the Commonwealth Conference on Economic Aid to Countries of South East Asia held in Sydney, Australia and was a delegate to United Nations General Assembly at Lake Success, New York. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1951. He held office until Labour lost power at the 1951 general election.

==Later life==
Macdonald continued to be active in public life.

A fluent Welsh speaker, from 1952 to 1960 he was National Governor for Wales of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and from 1953 until his death was chairman of the Broadcasting Council for Wales. From 1952 to 1959 he was a member of the Colonial Development Corporation.

A Congregationalist in religion, he was National President of the Band of Hope Union of Great Britain in 1951. He held two honorary doctorates in law from Mount Allison University, Sackville, New Brunswick and the University of Wales.

==Family==
In 1913 he married Mary Lewis of Blaenau Ffestiniog. The couple had two sons and one daughter.

He died in January 1966, aged 77. His eldest son, Gordon Ramsay MacDonald, succeeded him in the barony.

<text>Gédéon Ouimet (June 2, 1823 – April 23, 1905) was a French-Canadian politician.

Born in what is today part of the city of Laval, Quebec Canada, Ouimet served as the second premier of Quebec from February 26, 1873 to September 22, 1874. He resigned as party leader of the Conservative Party of Quebec in 1874 because of the Tanneries scandal which implicated the government of Quebec.

He was appointed to the Legislative Council of Quebec in 1895.

He died in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec in 1905.

The Quebec town of Grandmont changed its name to Saint-Gédéon in honour of Ouimet. A bridge on Highway 15 (Laurentian) was also named after him; the bridge crosses the Rivière des Mille Îles. It connects the municipality of Laval to the northern shore in what is now known as the town of Boisbriand.

<text>White River is a river, approximately long, in the U.S. states of Colorado and Utah and is a tributary of the Green River (which flows into the Colorado River).

==Description==

The river rises in two forks in northwestern Colorado in northeastern Garfield County in the Flat Tops Wilderness Area in the White River National Forest. The North Fork rises in Wall Lake and flows northwest, then southwest. The South Fork rises ten miles south of the north, flows southwest, then northwest, past Spring Cave. The two forks join near Buford in eastern Rio Blanco County, forming the White. It flows west, then northwest, past Meeker (site of the White River Museum), and across the broad valley between the Danforth Hills on the north and the Roan Plateau on the south. Downstream from Meeker, it is joined by Piceance Creek and Yellow Creek. In western Rio Blanco County, it turns southwest, flows past Rangely, where it is joined by Douglas Creek, and into Uintah County, Utah, where it joins the Green south of Ouray.

The White River is navigable by small boats throughout most of its length. But in low water years, the water level may be too low for navigation for a period of several months. Flows vary from in late summers of dry years to well over in spring.

==Dams and reservoirs==
The river is dammed in two places, both in Colorado. Taylor Draw Dam creates Kenney Reservoir near Rangely, and the Johnnie Johnson Dam impounds Rio Blanco Lake near White River City.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, White River has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="517136" wikidata="Q360574" url="?curid=517136" title="Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.">
<text>Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (March 8, 1841 – March 6, 1935) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1902 to 1932. Holmes is one of the most widely cited and influential Supreme Court justices in American history, noted for his long tenure on the Court and for his pithy opinions—particularly those on civil liberties and American constitutional democracy—and deference to the decisions of elected legislatures. Holmes retired from the Court at the age of 90, an unbeaten record for oldest justice on the Supreme Court. He previously served the Union as a brevet colonel in the American Civil War (in which he was wounded three times), as an associate justice and chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and as Weld Professor of Law at his alma mater, Harvard Law School. His positions, distinctive personality, and writing style made him a popular figure, especially with American progressives.

During his tenure on the U.S. Supreme Court, to which he was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, he supported the constitutionality of state economic regulation and came to advocate broad freedom of speech under the First Amendment, after, in &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; (1919), having upheld for a unanimous court criminal sanctions against draft protestors with the memorable maxim that &quot;free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic&quot; and formulating the groundbreaking &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test. Later that same year, in his famous dissent in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; (1919), he wrote that &quot;the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market... That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.&quot; He added that &quot;we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death...&quot;

&quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; has identified Holmes as the third-most-cited American legal scholar of the 20th century. Holmes was a legal realist, as summed up in his maxim, &quot;The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience,&quot; a moral skeptic, and an opponent of the doctrine of natural law. His jurisprudence and academic writing influenced much subsequent American legal thinking, including the judicial consensus upholding New Deal regulatory law and the influential American schools of pragmatism, critical legal studies, and law and economics.

==Early life==
Holmes was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to the prominent writer and physician Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and Amelia Lee Jackson Holmes. Both his parents were of English descent, and all his ancestors had come to North America from England during the early colonial period as part of the Puritan migration to New England. His mother opposed slavery and fulfilled her domestic role as traditionally understood. Dr. Holmes was a leading figure in Boston intellectual and literary circles. Mrs. Holmes was connected to the leading families; Henry James Sr., Ralph Waldo Emerson, and other transcendentalists were family friends.

Known as &quot;Wendell&quot; in his youth, Holmes became lifelong friends with the brothers William James and Henry James Jr. Holmes accordingly grew up in an atmosphere of intellectual achievement and early on formed the ambition to be a man of letters like Emerson. He retained an interest in writing poetry throughout his life. While still in Harvard College he wrote essays on philosophic themes and asked Emerson to read his attack on Plato&#x27;s idealist philosophy. Emerson famously replied, &quot;If you strike at a king, you must kill him.&quot; He supported the abolitionist movement that thrived in Boston society during the 1850s. At Harvard, he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, the Hasty Pudding and the Porcellian Club; his father had also been a member of both clubs. In the Pudding, he served as Secretary and Poet, as had his father. Holmes graduated Phi Beta Kappa and cum laude from Harvard in 1861, and, in the spring of that year, after President Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers following the firing on Fort Sumter, he enlisted in the Massachusetts militia but returned briefly to Harvard College to participate in commencement exercises.

===Civil War===

During his senior year of college, at the outset of the American Civil War, Holmes enlisted in the Fourth Battalion of Infantry in the Massachusetts militia, then in July 1861, with his father&#x27;s help, received a commission as second lieutenant in the Twentieth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He saw considerable combat during his service, taking part in the Peninsula Campaign, and the Wilderness, suffering wounds at the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff, Antietam, and Chancellorsville, and suffered from a near-fatal case of dysentery. He particularly admired and was close to Henry Livermore Abbott, a fellow officer in the 20th Massachusetts. Holmes rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, but eschewed command of his regiment upon his promotion. Abbott took command of the regiment in his place and was later killed.

In September 1863, while recovering at the Holmes family home on Charles Street in Boston from his third major combat injury, Holmes was promoted to colonel, but he never returned to the 20th Massachusetts because the unit had been largely destroyed. Upon his recovery, in January 1864 Holmes was appointed aide-de-camp of General Horatio Wright, then Division Commander of VI Corps, and later in command of the Corps. Holmes served with Wright during General Grant&#x27;s campaign down to Petersburg, returning to Washington with the Sixth Corps when the Capital was threatened in July 1864. On July 17, 1864, Holmes was mustered out at the end of his enlistment term, returning to Boston and enrolling at Harvard Law School later that year.

Holmes is said to have shouted to Abraham Lincoln to take cover during the Battle of Fort Stevens, although this is commonly regarded as apocryphal. Holmes himself expressed uncertainty about who had warned Lincoln (&quot;Some say it was an enlisted man who shouted at Lincoln; others suggest it was General Wright who brusquely ordered Lincoln to safety. But for a certainty, the 6 foot 4 inch Lincoln, in frock coat and top hat, stood peering through field glasses from behind a parapet at the onrushing rebels.&quot;) and other sources state he likely was not present on the day Lincoln visited Fort Stevens.

==Legal career==
===Lawyer===
In the summer of 1864, Holmes returned to the family home in Boston, wrote poetry, and debated philosophy with his friend William James, pursuing his debate with philosophic idealism, and considered re-enlisting. By the fall, when it became clear that the war would soon end, Holmes enrolled in Harvard Law School, &quot;kicked into the law&quot; by his father, as he later recalled. He attended lectures there for a single year, reading extensively in theoretical works, and then clerked for a year in his cousin Robert Morse&#x27;s office. In 1866, he received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Harvard, was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, and after a long visit to London to complete his education went into law practice in Boston. He joined a small firm, and in 1872 married a childhood friend, Fanny Bowditch Dixwell, buying a farm in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, the following year. Their marriage lasted until her death on April 30, 1929. They never had children. They did adopt and raise an orphaned cousin, Dorothy Upham. Fanny &quot;had a charming public persona. She could also be quiet and unassuming... She was essentially a shy and private woman [and] stand-offish... As she grew older, her inclination to solitude became more pronounced, and in time she became a virtual recluse...&quot;.

Whenever he could, Holmes visited London during the social season of spring and summer, and during his years as a lawyer and judge in Boston he formed romantic friendships with English women of the nobility, with whom he corresponded while at home in the United States. The most important of these was his friendship with the Anglo-Irish Clare Castletown, the Lady Castletown, whose family estate in Ireland, Doneraile Court, he visited several times, and with whom he may have had a brief affair. He formed his closest intellectual friendships with British men and became one of the founders of what was soon called the &quot;sociological&quot; school of jurisprudence in Great Britain, followed a generation later by the &quot;legal realist&quot; school in America.

Holmes practiced admiralty law and commercial law in Boston for fifteen years. It was during this time that he did his principal scholarly work, serving as an editor of the new &quot;American Law Review&quot;, reporting decisions of state supreme courts, and preparing a new edition of Kent&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, which served practitioners as a compendium of case law, at a time when official reports were scarce and difficult to obtain. He summarized his hard-won understanding in a series of lectures, collected and published as &quot;The Common Law&quot; in 1881.

===The Common Law===

&quot;The Common Law&quot; has been continuously in print since 1881 and remains an important contribution to jurisprudence. The book also remains controversial, for Holmes begins by rejecting various kinds of formalism in law. In his earlier writings he had expressly denied the utilitarian view that law was a set of commands of the sovereign, rules of conduct that became legal duties. He rejected as well the views of the German idealist philosophers, whose views were then widely held, and the philosophy taught at Harvard, that the opinions of judges could be harmonized in a purely logical system. In the opening paragraphs of the book, he famously summarized his own view of the history of the common law:

The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation&#x27;s development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.

In &quot;The Common Law&quot;, Holmes wrote that, even though the law &quot;uses the language of morality, it necessarily ends in external standards not dependent on the consciousness of the individual&quot; or on his moral culpability. Foreseeability of harm was the key: &quot;the general basis of criminal liability was knowledge, at the time of action, of facts from which common experience showed that certain harmful results were likely to follow.&quot; Tort liability, similarly, was imposed when circumstances were &quot;such as would have led a prudent man to perceive danger, although not necessarily to foresee the specific harm&quot;. Likewise, with respect to contracts, &quot;The law has nothing to do with the actual state of the parties&#x27; minds. In contract, as elsewhere, it must go by externals, and judge parties by their conduct.&quot;

In the book, Holmes set forth his view that the only source of law, properly speaking, was a judicial decision enforced by the state. Judges decided cases on the facts, and then wrote opinions afterward presenting a rationale for their decision. The true basis of the decision was often an &quot;inarticulate major premise&quot;, however. A judge was obliged to choose between contending legal arguments, each posed in absolute terms, and the true basis of his decision was sometimes drawn from outside the law, when precedents were lacking or were evenly divided.

The common law evolves because civilized society evolves, and judges share the common preconceptions of the governing class. These views endeared Holmes to the later advocates of legal realism and made him one of the early founders of law and economics jurisprudence. Holmes famously contrasted his own scholarship with the abstract doctrines of Christopher Columbus Langdell, dean of Harvard Law School, who viewed the common law as a self-enclosed set of doctrines. Holmes viewed Langdell&#x27;s work as akin to the German philosophic idealism he had for so long resisted, opposing it with his own scientific materialism. Albert Alschuler, however, wrote, &quot;Langdell was innocent of the charge ... of attempting to deduce law from &quot;a priori&quot; premises&quot;.

===State court judge===
Holmes was considered for a federal court judgeship in 1878 by President Rutherford B. Hayes, but Massachusetts Senator George Frisbie Hoar persuaded Hayes to nominate another candidate. In the fall of 1882, Holmes became a professor at Harvard Law School, accepting an endowed professorship that had been created for him, largely through the efforts of Louis D. Brandeis. On Friday, December 8, 1882, Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts associate justice Otis Lord decided to resign, giving outgoing Republican governor John Davis Long a chance to appoint his successor, if he could do so before the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council adjourned at 3 pm. Holmes&#x27;s partner George Shattuck proposed him for the vacancy, Holmes quickly agreed, and there being no objection by the council, he took the oath of office on December 15, 1882. His resignation from his professorship, after only a few weeks and without notice, was resented by the law school faculty, with James Bradley Thayer finding Holmes&#x27;s conduct &quot;selfish&quot; and &quot;thoughtless&quot;. On August 2, 1899, Holmes became chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court following the death of Walbridge A. Field.

During his service on the Massachusetts court, Holmes continued to develop and apply his views of the common law, usually following precedent faithfully. He issued few constitutional opinions in these years, but carefully developed the principles of free expression as a common-law doctrine. He departed from precedent to recognize workers&#x27; right to organize trade unions and to strike, as long as no violence was involved, and coercion was not exerted through impermissible means such as secondary boycotts, stating in his opinions that fundamental fairness required that workers be allowed to combine to compete on an equal footing with employers. He continued to give speeches and to write articles that added to or extended his work on the common law, most notably &quot;Privilege, Malice and Intent&quot;, in which he presented his view of the pragmatic basis of the common-law privileges extended to speech and the press, which could be defeated by a showing of malice, or of specific intent to harm.

Famously, he observed in &quot;McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford&quot; (1892) that a policeman &quot;may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman&quot;. He also published an address, &quot;The Path of the Law&quot;, which is best known for its prediction theory of law, that &quot;[t]he prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by law&quot;, and for its &quot;bad man&quot; perspective on the law, that &quot;[i]f you really want to know the law and nothing else, you must look at it as a bad man, who cares only for the material consequences which such knowledge enables him to predict&quot;.

==Supreme Court Justice==

===Overview===

Soon after the death of Associate Justice Horace Gray in July 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt made known his intention to appoint Holmes as Gray&#x27;s successor; it was the president&#x27;s stated desire to fill the vacancy with someone from Massachusetts. The nomination was supported by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, the junior senator from Massachusetts, but was opposed by its senior senator, George Frisbie Hoar, who was also chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hoar was a strenuous opponent of imperialism, and the legality of the annexation of Puerto Rico and the Philippines was expected to come before the Court. Lodge, like Roosevelt, was a strong supporter of imperialism, which Holmes was expected to support as well.

Despite Hoar&#x27;s opposition, the president moved ahead on the matter. On December 2, 1902, he formally submitted the nomination and Holmes was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 4. He was sworn into office on December 8.

On the bench, Holmes did vote to support the administration&#x27;s position favoring the annexation of former Spanish colonies in the &quot;Insular Cases&quot;. However, he later disappointed Roosevelt by dissenting in &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot;, a major antitrust prosecution; the majority of the court opposed Holmes and sided with Roosevelt&#x27;s belief that Northern Securities violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The dissent by Holmes permanently damaged his formerly close relationship with Roosevelt.

Holmes was known for his pithy, frequently quoted opinions. In more than twenty-nine years on the Supreme Court bench, he ruled on cases spanning the whole range of federal law. He is remembered for prescient opinions on topics as varied as copyright law, the law of contempt, the antitrust status of professional baseball, and the oath required for citizenship. Holmes, like most of his contemporaries, viewed the Bill of Rights as codifying privileges obtained over the centuries in English and American common law, and he established that view in numerous opinions for the Court. He is considered one of the greatest judges in American history and embodies for many the traditions of the common law. A eugenicist, he wrote the majority opinion in Buck v. Bell, upholding forced sterilization. Tens of thousands of the procedures followed.

From the departure of William Howard Taft on February 3, 1930, until Charles Evans Hughes became chief justice on February 24, 1930, Holmes briefly acted as the chief justice and presided over court sessions.

===Noteworthy Supreme Court opinions===

====&quot;Otis v. Parker&quot;====
Beginning with his first opinion for the Court in &quot;Otis v. Parker&quot; (1903), Holmes exhibited his tendency to defer to legislatures, which two years later he did most famously in his dissenting opinion in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905). In &quot;Otis v. Parker&quot;, the Court, in an opinion by Holmes, upheld the constitutionality of a California statute that provided that &quot;all contracts for the sales of shares of the capital stock of any corporation or association on margin, or to be delivered at a future day, shall be void...&quot; Holmes he wrote that, as a general proposition, &quot;neither a state legislature nor a state constitution can interfere arbitrarily with private business or transactions... But general propositions do not carry us far. While the courts must exercise a judgment of their own, it by no means is true that every law is void which may seem to the judges who pass upon it excessive, unsuited to its ostensible end, or based upon conceptions of morality with which they disagree. Considerable latitude must be allowed for differences of view... If the state thinks that an admitted evil cannot be prevented except by prohibiting a calling or transaction not in itself necessarily objectionable, the courts cannot interfere, unless... they can see that it &#x27;is a clear, unmistakable infringement of rights secured by the fundamental law.&#x27;&quot;

====&quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;====
In his dissenting opinion in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905), Holmes supported labor, not out of sympathy for workers, but because of his tendency to defer to legislatures. In &quot;Lochner&quot;, the Court struck down a New York statute that prohibited employees (spelled &quot;employes&quot; at the time) from being required or permitted to work in a bakery more than sixty hours a week. The majority found that the statute &quot;interferes with the right of contract between the employer and employes&quot;, and that the right of contract, though not explicit in the Constitution, &quot;is part of the liberty of the individual protected by the Fourteenth Amendment&quot;, under which no state may &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; In his brief dissent, Holmes said that the majority had reached its decision on the basis of the economic theory of &quot;laissez faire&quot;, but that the Constitution does not prevent the states from interfering with the liberty to contract. &quot;The Fourteenth Amendment&quot;, Holmes wrote, &quot;does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer&#x27;s Social Statics&quot;, which advocates &quot;laissez faire&quot;.

====&quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;====
In a series of opinions surrounding the World War I Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, Holmes held that the freedom of expression guaranteed by federal and state constitutions simply declared a common-law privilege for speech and the press, even when those expressions caused injury, but that the privilege could be defeated by a showing of malice or intent to do harm. Holmes came to write three unanimous opinions for the Supreme Court that arose from prosecutions under the 1917 Espionage Act because in an earlier case, &quot;Baltzer v. United States&quot;, he had circulated a powerfully expressed dissent, when the majority had voted to uphold a conviction of immigrant socialists who had circulated a petition criticizing the draft. Apparently learning that he was likely to publish this dissent, the government (perhaps alerted by Justice Louis D. Brandeis, newly appointed by President Woodrow Wilson) abandoned the case, and it was dismissed by the Court. The chief justice then asked Holmes to write opinions that could be unanimous, upholding convictions in three similar cases, where there were jury findings that speeches or leaflets were published with an intent to obstruct the draft, a crime under the 1917 law. Although there was no evidence that the attempts had succeeded, Holmes, in &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; (1919), held for a unanimous Court that an attempt, purely by language, could be prosecuted if the expression, in the circumstances in which it was uttered, posed a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; that the legislature had properly forbidden. In his opinion for the Court, Holmes famously declared that the First Amendment would not protect a person &quot;falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic&quot;.

====&quot;Abrams v. United States&quot;====
Later in 1919, however, in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot;, Holmes dissented. The Wilson Administration was vigorously prosecuting those suspected of sympathies with the recent Russian Revolution, as well as opponents of the war against Germany. The defendants in this case were socialists and anarchists, recent immigrants from Russia who opposed the apparent efforts of the United States to intervene in the Russian Civil War. They were charged with violating the Sedition Act of 1918, which was an amendment to the Espionage Act of 1917 that made criticisms of the government or the war effort a crime. Abrams and his co-defendants were charged with distributing leaflets (one in English and one in Yiddish) that called for a &quot;general strike&quot; to protest the U.S. intervention in Russia. A majority of the Court voted to uphold the convictions and sentences of ten and twenty years, to be followed by deportation, while Holmes dissented. The majority claimed to be following the precedents already set in Schenck and the other cases in which Holmes had written for the Court, but Holmes insisted that the defendants&#x27; leaflets neither threatened to cause any harm nor showed a specific intent to hinder the war effort. Holmes condemned the Wilson Administration&#x27;s prosecution and its insistence on draconian sentences for the defendants in passionate language: &quot;Even if I am technically wrong [regarding the defendants&#x27; intent] and enough can be squeezed from these poor and puny anonymities to turn the color of legal litmus paper... the most nominal punishment seems to me all that possibly could be inflicted, unless the defendants are to be made to suffer, not for what the indictment alleges, but for the creed that they avow...&quot; Holmes then went on to explain the importance of freedom of thought in a democracy:

[W]hen men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe... that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.

In writing this dissent, Holmes may have been influenced by Zechariah Chafee&#x27;s article &quot;Freedom of Speech in War Time&quot;. Chafee had criticized Holmes&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Schenck&quot; for failing to express in more detail and more clearly the common-law doctrines upon which he relied. In his &quot;Abrams&quot; dissent, Holmes did elaborate somewhat on the decision in &quot;Schenck&quot;, roughly along the lines that Chafee had suggested. Although Holmes evidently believed that he was adhering to his own precedent, some later commentators accused Holmes of inconsistency, even of seeking to curry favor with his young admirers. In &quot;Abrams&quot;, the majority opinion relied on the clear-and-present-danger formulation of &quot;Schenck&quot;, claiming that the leaflets showed the necessary intent, and ignoring that they were unlikely to have any effect. By contrast, the Supreme Court&#x27;s current formulation of the clear and present danger test, stated in 1969 in &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;, holds that &quot;advocacy of the use of force or of law violation&quot; is protected by the First Amendment &quot;unless such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action&quot;.

====&quot;Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States&quot;====
In &quot;Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States&quot; (1920), Holmes ruled that any evidence obtained, even indirectly, from an illegal search was inadmissible in court. He reasoned that otherwise, police would have an incentive to circumvent the Fourth Amendment to obtain derivatives of the illegally obtained evidence. This later became known as the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine.

====&quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;====
In 1927, Holmes wrote the 8–1 majority opinion in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, a case that upheld the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924 and the forced sterilization of Carrie Buck, who was claimed to be mentally defective. Later scholarship has shown that the suit was collusive, in that &quot;two eugenics enthusiasts... had chosen Buck as a bit player in a test case that they had devised&quot; and &quot;had asked Buck&#x27;s guardian to challenge [the Virginia sterilization law]&quot;. In addition, Carrie Buck was probably of normal intelligence. The argument made on her behalf was principally that the statute requiring sterilization of institutionalized persons was unconstitutional, violating what today is called &quot;substantive due process&quot;. Holmes repeated familiar arguments that statutes would not be struck down if they appeared on their face to have a reasonable basis. In support of his argument that the interest of &quot;public welfare&quot; outweighs the interest of individuals in their bodily integrity, he argued:

Sterilization rates under eugenics laws in the United States climbed from 1927 until &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot;, 316 U.S. 535 (1942), in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared unconstitutional an Oklahoma statute that provided for the sterilization of &quot;habitual criminals&quot;.
&quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; continues to be cited occasionally in support of due process requirements for state interventions in medical procedures. For instance, in 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit cited &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; to protect the constitutional rights of a woman coerced into sterilization without procedural due process. The court stated that error and abuse will result if the state does not follow the procedural requirements, established by &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, for performing an involuntary sterilization. &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; was also cited briefly, though not discussed, in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, in support of the proposition that the Court does not recognize an &quot;unlimited right to do with one&#x27;s body as one pleases&quot;. However, although &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; has not been overturned, &quot;the Supreme Court has distinguished the case out of existence&quot;.

==Jurisprudential contributions==

===Critique of formalism===

From his earliest writings, Holmes demonstrated a lifelong belief that the decisions of judges were consciously or unconsciously result-oriented and reflected the mores of the class and society from which judges were drawn. In his 1881 book &quot;The Common Law&quot;, Holmes argued that legal rules are not deduced through formal logic but rather emerge from an active process of human self-government. He expressed this idea most famously in &quot;The Common Law&quot; with the statement, &quot;The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience&quot;. His philosophy represented a departure from the prevailing jurisprudence of the time: legal formalism, which held that law was an orderly system of rules from which decisions in particular cases could be deduced. Holmes sought to consciously reinvent the common law – to modernize it as a tool for adjusting to the changing nature of modern life, as judges of the past had done more or less unconsciously. He has been classed with the philosophic pragmatists, although pragmatism is what he attributed to the law, rather than his personal philosophy.

Central to his thought was the notion that the law, as it had evolved in modern societies, was concerned with the material results of a defendant&#x27;s actions. A judge&#x27;s task was to decide which of two parties before him would bear the cost of an injury. Holmes argued that the evolving common law standard was that liability would fall upon a person whose conduct failed to reflect the prudence of a &quot;reasonable man&quot;:

This &quot;objective standard&quot; adopted by common-law judges, Holmes thought, reflected a shift in community standards, away from condemnation of a person&#x27;s act toward an impersonal assessment of its value to the community. In the modern world, the advances made in biology and the social sciences should allow a better conscious determination of the results of individual acts and the proper measure of liability for them. This belief in the pronouncements of science concerning social welfare, although he later doubted its applicability to law in many cases, accounts for his enthusiastic endorsement of eugenics in his writings, and his opinion in the case of &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;.

===Legal positivism===

In 1881, in &quot;The Common Law&quot;, Holmes brought together into a coherent whole his earlier articles and lectures concerning the history of the common law (judicial decisions in England and the United States), which he interpreted from the perspective of a practicing lawyer. What counted as law, to a lawyer, was what judges did in particular cases. Law was what the state would enforce, through violence if necessary; echoes of his experience in the Civil War were often present in his writings. Judges decided where and when the force of the state would be brought to bear, and judges in the modern world tended to consult facts and consequences when deciding what conduct to punish. The decisions of judges, viewed over time, determined the rules of conduct and the legal duties by which all are bound. Judges did not and should not consult any external system of morality, certainly not a system imposed by a deity.

Being a legal positivist, Holmes brought himself into constant conflict with scholars who believed that legal duties rested upon natural law, a moral order of the kind invoked by Christian theologians and other philosophic idealists. He believed instead &quot;that men make their own laws; that these laws do not flow from some mysterious omnipresence in the sky, and that judges are not independent mouthpieces of the infinite.&quot; &quot;The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky.&quot; Rather than a set of abstract, rational, mathematical, or in any way unworldly set of principles, Holmes said: &quot;[T]he prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law.&quot;

His belief that law, properly speaking, was a set of generalizations from what judges had done in similar cases, determined his view of the Constitution of the United States. As a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Holmes rejected the argument that the text of the Constitution should be applied directly to cases that came before the court, as if it were a statute. He shared with most of his fellow jurists the belief that the Constitution carried forward principles derived from the common law, principles that continued to evolve in American courts. The text of the Constitution itself, as originally understood, was not a set of rules, but only a directive to courts to consider the body of the common law when deciding cases that arose under the Constitution. It followed that constitutional principles adopted from the common law were evolving, as the law itself evolved: &quot;A word [in the Constitution] is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought&quot;.

The provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas that have their essence in form, they are organic, living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital, not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.

Holmes also insisted on the separation of &quot;ought&quot; and &quot;is&quot;, confusion of which he saw as an obstacle in understanding the realities of the law. &quot;The law is full of phraseology drawn from morals, and talks about &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;duties&quot;, &quot;malice&quot;, &quot;intent&quot;, and &quot;negligence&quot; – and nothing is easier in legal reasoning than to take these words in their moral sense&quot;. &quot;Therefore nothing but confusion can result from assuming that the rights of man in a moral sense are equally rights in the sense of the Constitution and the law&quot;. Holmes said, &quot;I think our morally tinted words have caused a great deal of confused thinking&quot;.

Nevertheless, in rejecting morality as a form of natural law outside of and superior to human enactments, Holmes was not rejecting moral principles that were the &quot;result&quot; of enforceable law: &quot;The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. Its history is the history of the moral development of the race. The practice of it, in spite of popular jests, tends to make good citizens and good men. When I emphasize the difference between law and morals I do so with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law.&quot; Holmes&#x27;s insistence on the material basis of law, on the facts of a case, has led some to characterize him as unfeeling, however. George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Rosen summarized Holmes&#x27;s views this way: &quot;Holmes was a cold and brutally cynical man who had contempt for the masses and for the progressive laws he voted to uphold... an aristocratic nihilist who once told his sister that he loathed &#x27;the thick-fingered clowns we call the people&#x27;.&quot;

===Reputation as a dissenter===
Although Holmes did not dissent frequently—during his 29 years on the U.S. Supreme Court, he wrote only 72 separate opinions, whereas he penned 852 majority opinions—his dissents were often prescient and acquired so much authority that he became known as &quot;The Great Dissenter&quot;. Chief Justice Taft complained that &quot;his opinions are short, and not very helpful&quot;. Two of his most famous dissents were in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; and &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;.

==Speeches and letters==

===Speeches===
Only Holmes&#x27;s legal writings were readily available during his life and in the first years after his death, but he confided his thoughts more freely in talks, often to limited audiences, and more than two thousand letters that have survived. Holmes&#x27;s executor, John Gorham Palfrey, diligently collected Holmes&#x27;s published and unpublished papers and donated them (and their copyrights) to Harvard Law School. Harvard Law Professor Mark De Wolfe Howe undertook to edit the papers and was authorized by the school to publish them and to prepare a biography of Holmes. Howe published several volumes of correspondence, beginning with Holmes&#x27;s correspondence with Frederick Pollock, and a volume of Holmes&#x27;s speeches, before his untimely death. Howe&#x27;s work formed the basis of much subsequent Holmes scholarship.

Holmes&#x27;s speeches were divided into two groups: public addresses, which he gathered into a slim volume, regularly updated, that he gave to friends and used as a visiting card, and less formal addresses to men&#x27;s clubs, dinners, law schools, and Twentieth Regiment reunions. All of the speeches are reproduced in the third volume of &quot;The Collected Works of Justice Holmes&quot;. The public addresses are Holmes&#x27;s effort to express his personal philosophy in Emersonian, poetic terms. They frequently advert to the Civil War and to death, and express a hope that personal sacrifice, however pointless it may seem, serves to advance the human race toward some as-yet unforeseen goal. This mysterious purpose explained the commitment to duty and honor that Holmes felt deeply himself and that he thought was the birthright of a certain class of men. As Holmes stated at a talk upon receiving an honorary degree from Yale:

In the 1890s, at a time when &quot;scientific&quot; anthropology that spoke of racial differences was in vogue, his observations took on a bleakly Darwinist cast:

This talk was widely reprinted and admired at the time, and may have contributed to the popular name given by the press to the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry (the &quot;Rough Riders&quot;) during the Spanish–American War.

On May 30, 1895, Holmes gave the address at a Memorial Day function held by the Graduating Class of Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. The speech, which came to be known as &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Faith&quot;, expressed Holmes&#x27;s view of the conflict between the high ideals that motivated his generation to fight in the Civil War and the reality of a soldier&#x27;s experience and personal pledge to follow orders into battle. Holmes stated:

In the conclusion of the speech, Holmes said:

Theodore Roosevelt reportedly admired Holmes&#x27;s &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Faith&quot; speech, and it is believed to have contributed to his decision to nominate Holmes to the Supreme Court.

===Letters===

Many of Holmes&#x27;s closest male friends were in England and he corresponded with them regularly and at length, speaking usually of his work. Letters to friends in England such as Harold Laski and Frederick Pollock contain frank discussion of his decisions and his fellow justices. In the United States, letters to friends Morris R. Cohen, Lewis Einstein, Felix Frankfurter, and Franklin Ford are similar, although the letters to Frankfurter are especially personal. Holmes&#x27;s correspondence with women in Great Britain and the U.S. was at least as extensive, and in many ways more revealing, but these series of letters have not been published. An extensive selection of letters to Claire Castletown, in Ireland, are quoted in &quot;Honorable Justice: The Life of Oliver Wendell Holmes&quot;, by Sheldon Novick. These letters are closer to Holmes&#x27;s conversation and cast light upon the style he adopted in judicial opinions, which were often designed to be read aloud.

In a letter to a contemporary, Holmes made this comment on international comparisons: &quot;Judge not a people by the ferocity of its men, but by the steadfastness of its women.&quot;

==Retirement, death, honors and legacy==

Holmes was widely admired during his last years, and on his ninetieth birthday he was honored on one of the first coast-to-coast radio broadcasts, during which Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Dean of Yale Law School Charles Edward Clark, and the president of the American Bar Association read encomia; the Bar Association presented him with a gold medal. Holmes served on the Court until January 12, 1932, when his brethren on the Court, citing his advanced age, suggested that the time had come for him to step down. By that time, at 90 years and 10 months of age, he was the oldest justice to serve in the Court&#x27;s history. (His record has been challenged only by John Paul Stevens, who in 2010 retired at 8 months younger than Holmes had been at his own retirement.) On Holmes&#x27;s ninety-second birthday, newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife, Eleanor, called on Holmes at his home in Washington, D.C. Holmes died of pneumonia in Washington on March 6, 1935, two days short of his 94th birthday. He was the last living justice of the Fuller Court; he had been between 1925 and 1932 the last justice of that Court to remain on the bench.

In his will, Holmes left his residuary estate to the United States government (he had earlier said that &quot;taxes are what we pay for civilized society&quot; in &quot;Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas&quot; vs. &quot;Collector of Internal Revenue&quot;, 275 U.S. 87, 100 (1927).) After his death, his personal effects included his Civil War officer&#x27;s uniform still stained with his blood and &quot;torn with shot&quot; as well as the Minié balls that had wounded him three times in separate battles. Holmes was buried beside his wife in Arlington National Cemetery.
The United States Postal Service honored Holmes with a Prominent Americans series (1965–1978) 15¢ postage stamp. A bust of Justice Holmes, sculpted by Joseph Kiselewski, was installed in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at New York University in New York City in 1970.

Holmes&#x27;s papers, donated to Harvard Law School, were kept closed for many years after his death, a circumstance that gave rise to somewhat fanciful accounts of his life. Catherine Drinker Bowen&#x27;s fictionalized biography &quot;Yankee from Olympus&quot; was a long-time bestseller, and the 1946 Broadway play and 1950 Hollywood motion picture &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot; were based on a biography of Holmes by Francis Biddle, who had been one of his secretaries. Much of the scholarly literature addressing Holmes&#x27;s opinions was written before much was known about his life, and before a coherent account of his views was available. The Harvard Law Library eventually relented and made available to scholars the extensive Holmes papers, collected and annotated by Mark DeWolfe Howe, who died before he was able to complete his own biography of the justice. In 1989, the first full biography based on Holmes&#x27;s papers was published, and several other biographies followed. A bust of Justice Holmes, sculpted by Joseph Kiselewski, was installed at the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in 1970. 
Congress established the U.S. Permanent Committee for the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise within the Library of Congress with the funds he left to the United States in his will, which were used to create a memorial garden at the Supreme Court building and to publish an ongoing series on the history of the Supreme Court.

Holmes&#x27;s summer house in Beverly, Massachusetts, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972, recognition for his contributions to American jurisprudence.

Justice Holmes was an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati.

==Clerks==

&quot;Many secretaries formed close friendships with one another&quot;, wrote Tony Hiss, son of Alger Hiss, about the special club of clerks of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. They included:
* Robert M. Benjamin (later, lawyer for an appeal by Alger Hiss)
* Laurence Curtis, U.S. Representative
* Alger Hiss, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and convicted perjurer
* Donald Hiss, partner, Covington &amp; Burling law firm
* Irving Sands Olds, chairman of U.S. Steel
* H. Chapman Rose, Undersecretary of the United States Treasury
* Chauncey Belknap IV, name partner in Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler, one of the largest law firms in New York during his time, and an attorney for the Rockefeller Foundation, father of Robert L. Belknap

==In popular culture==
* American actor Louis Calhern portrayed Holmes in the 1946 play &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;, with Dorothy Gish as Holmes&#x27;s wife Fanny. In 1950, Calhern repeated his performance in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s film version &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;, for which he received his only Academy Award nomination. Ann Harding co-starred in the film. A 1965 television adaptation of the play starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in one of their few appearances on the small screen.
* In the movie &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), defense advocate Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) quotes Holmes twice. First, with one of his earlier opinions:

Second, on the sterilization laws enacted in Virginia and upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;:

: This was in relation to Holmes&#x27;s support for eugenics laws in the United States, which Rolfe argued were not different in principle from the Nazi laws. In the earlier &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; television version from 1959, which also quotes Holmes in this context, the tribunal judge Ives, who ultimately presents a dissenting verdict, is played by the actor Wendell Holmes (1914–1962), born Oliver Wendell Holmes.
* Holmes appears as a minor character in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s novels &quot;Copperhead&quot; and &quot;The Bloody Ground&quot;, the second and fourth volumes of his &quot;Starbuck Chronicles&quot;; the novels portray the battles of Ball&#x27;s Bluff and Antietam, in both of which the young Lieutenant Holmes was wounded in action.
* The 1960s television sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot; starred Eddie Albert as a character named Oliver Wendell Douglas, a Manhattan white-shoe lawyer who gives up the law to become a farmer. His name is a combination of two Supreme Court Justices, Holmes and William O. Douglas.
* The 1980 comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot; features a character named Oliver Wendell Jones, a young computer hacker and gifted scientist.
* &quot;Holmes&quot;. &quot;This 75-minute staged reading stars Kevin Reese showcasing the wit and wisdom of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.&quot; Written by Todd C. Peppers, Directed by Mary Hall Surface. World premier at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., October 30, 2023.

<text>Swansea is a town at the entrance to Lake Macquarie from the Pacific Ocean in New South Wales, Australia. It is part of the City of Lake Macquarie local government area and is regarded as part of Greater Newcastle.

==History==
The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land.

Swansea&#x27;s local industries are coal mining, fishing, boating, and tourism. There were once several small coal mines. There are also popular fine sandy beaches on the Pacific Ocean, Swansea Channel and Lake Macquarie. It is 25.2 km away from the city of Newcastle, where many residents commute to for work.

<doc id="517141" wikidata="Q7334735" url="?curid=517141" title="Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia">
<text>The Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia is a book published yearly by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

&quot;Ring&quot; editor Nat Fleischer, noting that other sports had record books and that boxing did not have any books specialized in keeping fans up to date as far as the participants&#x27; records, began writing the first &quot;Ring&quot; boxing encyclopedia in 1941. It was published for the first time in 1942. Fleischer wanted to create a book that would keep fans informed about the history of boxing and their favorite fighters, and, at the same time, help fighters&#x27; managers and promoters choose who their protégé&#x27;s next opponent should be. It also included a detailed history of title fights for each division, and a section of a list of boxing record setters.

With time, the book would also include round by round scoring for each title fight held on the year prior. At its peak, the book consisted of close to 600 pages of records and stats.

After Fleischer died in 1972, Stanley Weston took over the production and edition of the yearly encyclopedia book. During this period, &quot;Ring Record book and boxing Encyclopedia&quot;s were hard-cover books, with a glossy, outside cover that had color photos of famous modern fighters of the era.

In 1990, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine went bankrupt, and the &quot;Ring Encyclopedia&quot; stopped being produced. In 1992, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine returned to the stands, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1994 that the encyclopedia returned.

The new version of the &quot;Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia&quot; is a smaller, pocket sized book with a different context separating it from the original one. It is a soft cover book that covers the history of each division, but including only the fights where world titles changed hands. It also includes a recap of title fights held the year before, but without the judges&#x27; scorecards for any of the fights. It only has the records of current world champions (except WBO ones, as &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine has always refused to recognize WBO world champions as such), and of leading contenders. It also has a recap of &quot;Ring&quot;&#x27;s articles of the past twelve months. Currently, the encyclopedic books are edited by Steve Farhood.

The original version of the encyclopedia, which was a mail-order item, topped at a price of 25 dollars. Many books in the original format are now collector&#x27;s items, and as such, their prices have gone up. The new version usually sells for 5 dollars at many supermarkets and other stores.

<doc id="517142" wikidata="Q388286" url="?curid=517142" title="Bobby Womack">
<text>Robert Dwayne Womack ( ; March 4, 1944 – June 27, 2014) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. Starting in the early 1950s as the lead singer of his family musical group the Valentinos and as Sam Cooke&#x27;s backing guitarist, Womack&#x27;s career spanned more than 60 years and multiple styles, including R&amp;B, blues, doo-wop, gospel, funk, and soul. 

Womack was a prolific songwriter who wrote and originally recorded &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot; with his brothers, the Valentinos (a song that later became the Rolling Stones&#x27; first UK number one hit) and New Birth&#x27;s &quot;I Can Understand It&quot;. As a singer, he is most notable for the hits &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Love&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I Feel About Cha&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, &quot;Harry Hippie&quot;, &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;, and his 1980s hits &quot;If You Think You&#x27;re Lonely Now&quot; and &quot;I Wish He Didn&#x27;t Trust Me So Much&quot;.

In 2009, Womack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Womack was born in the Fairfax neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, near East 85th Street and Quincy Avenue, to Naomi Womack and Friendly Womack, the third of five sons. Friendly Jr. and Curtis were Bobby&#x27;s older brothers, and Harry and Cecil were his younger brothers. They all grew up in the Cleveland slums, so poor that the family would fish pig snouts out of the local supermarket&#x27;s trash. He had to share a bed with his brothers. His mother told him he could &quot;sing his way out of the ghetto.&quot; Recalling his childhood, Bobby said, &quot;we came up very poor. My kids have had a much better life than I&#x27;d ever thought of livin,&#x27;&quot; and, &quot;the neighborhood was so ghetto that we didn&#x27;t bother the rats and they didn&#x27;t bother us.&quot;

Raised Baptist, their mother played the organ for the church choir, and their father was a steelworker, part-time minister, and musician who played the guitar and also sang gospel. Their father repeatedly ordered his sons to not touch his guitar while he was away, yet all five brothers regularly played it while their father was at work. One night, eight-year-old Bobby broke a guitar string, then tried to replace the string with a shoelace. After Friendly deduced that Bobby (who was missing a shoelace) had broken the string, he offered Bobby the chance to play the guitar for him in lieu of a whipping:

Soon afterwards, Friendly bought guitars for all five of his sons. Because Bobby was left-handed, he flipped his guitar upside-down to play, not knowing that the guitar could have been restrung to accommodate a left-handed player.

== Career ==

By the mid-1950s, 10-year-old Bobby was touring with his brothers on the midwest gospel circuit as The Womack Brothers, along with Naomi on organ and Friendly Sr. on guitar. In 1954, under the moniker Curtis Womack and the Womack Brothers, the group issued the Pennant single, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;. More records followed.

Sam Cooke, the lead singer of The Soul Stirrers, first saw the group performing in the mid-1950s. He became their mentor and helped them go on tour. They went on national tours with The Staple Singers. Even though Curtis often sang lead, Bobby was allowed to sing alongside him showcasing his gruff baritone vocals in contrast to his older brother&#x27;s smoother tenor. During performances, Bobby would sometimes imitate the role of a preacher, which later became his nickname. At just 16, Bobby dropped out of high school.

At the beginning of the 1960s, Cooke formed SAR Records and signed the quintet to the label in 1961, where they released a handful of gospel singles. Then, Cooke changed their name to the Valentinos, relocated them to Los Angeles and convinced them to transition from gospel music to secular soul-and pop-influenced sound. Cooke produced and arranged the group&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Love&quot;, which was a pop version of the gospel song, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Hear Nobody Pray&quot;, they had recorded earlier. The song became an R&amp;B hit and helped land the group an opening spot for James Brown&#x27;s tour. The group&#x27;s next hit came in 1964 with the country-tinged &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot;, co-composed by Bobby. Their version was rising on the charts when The Rolling Stones covered it.

Womack was also a member of Cooke&#x27;s band, touring and recording with him from 1961. The Valentinos&#x27; career was left shaky after Sam Cooke was shot and killed in a Los Angeles motel. Devastated by the news, the brothers disbanded and SAR Records folded. Womack attempted to start his solo career in 1965, first recording for Him Records and later the Chess Records subsidiary, Checker Records. Womack faced backlash after his marriage to Cooke&#x27;s widow Barbara Cooke. He would go to radio stations and disc jockeys would throw away his records. He continued to work as a session musician. Between 1965 and 1968, he toured and recorded with Ray Charles.

===1967–1972: Early solo career===
Circa 1965, Womack relocated to Memphis where he worked at Chips Moman&#x27;s American Studios. He played guitar on recordings by Joe Tex and the Box Tops. Womack played guitar on several of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s albums, including &quot;Lady Soul&quot;, but not on the hit song &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;, as erroneously reported. His work as a songwriter caught the ear of music executives after Wilson Pickett took a liking to some of Womack&#x27;s songs and insisted on recording them. Among the songs were &quot;I&#x27;m a Midnight Mover&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;.

In 1968, Bobby signed with Minit Records and recorded his first solo album, &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, where he scored his first major hit with a cover of Barry McGuire&#x27;s &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;. In 1969, Womack forged a partnership with Gábor Szabó and with Szabó, penned the instrumental &quot;Breezin&#x27;&quot;, later a hit for George Benson. Womack also worked with rock musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Janis Joplin, contributing vocals and guitar work on the Family Stone&#x27;s accomplished album &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;, and penning the ballad &quot;Trust Me&quot;, for Joplin on her album &quot;Pearl&quot;. In fact, Womack was one of the last people to see Joplin alive, having visited her hours before she died at the Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles, California.

After two more albums with Minit, Bobby switched labels, signing with United Artists where he changed his attire and his musical direction with the album &quot;Communication&quot;. The album bolstered his first top 40 hit, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I Feel About Cha&quot;, which peaked at number two R&amp;B and number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the spring of 1972.

===1972–1989: Solo success===
Following &quot;Communication&quot;, Womack&#x27;s profile was raised with two more albums, released in 1972. The first was &quot;Understanding&quot;, noted for the track &quot;I Can Understand It&quot;, later covered by the funk band New Birth and a three-sibling lineup of Bobby&#x27;s old group, the Valentinos, and two hit singles, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; and &quot;Harry Hippie&quot;. The latter song was written for Womack by Jim Ford in a country version, which Womack re-arranged in an R&amp;B version. &quot;Harry Hippie&quot; later became Womack&#x27;s first single to be certified gold. &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; became Womack&#x27;s first single to hit number one on the R&amp;B charts.

Another hit album released after &quot;Understanding&quot; was the soundtrack to the blaxploitation film &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;. The title track became popular during its initial 1972 release and later would be played during the opening and closing scenes of the 1997 film &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. In 1973, Womack released another hit album, &quot;Facts of Life&quot;, and had a top 40 hit with &quot;Nobody Knows You When You&#x27;re Down and Out,&quot; an older song Sam Cooke had done years before.

In 1974, Womack released his most successful single during this period with a remake of his first hit single, &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Love&quot;. His solo version of the song became even more successful than the original with the Valentinos, becoming his second number-one hit on the R&amp;B chart and peaking at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming his only hit to reach that high on the pop chart. The song was featured on the album &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Love Again&quot; and featured the minor hit &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome, Stop on By&quot;, later covered by Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan. Womack&#x27;s career began stalling after Womack received the news of his brother Harry&#x27;s death. Womack continued to record albums with United Artists through 1975 and 1976 but with less success than previous albums. In 1975, Womack collaborated with Rolling Stones member Ronnie Wood, on Wood&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Now Look&quot;. In 1976, Womack organized a benefit at the Hollywood Palladium to raise funds for his friend, singer Jackie Wilson, who had suffered a heart attack.

Womack languished with his own recordings during the late 1970s but continued to be a frequent collaborator with other artists, most notably Wilton Felder of the Crusaders. After his son Truth Bobby died in 1978, Womack formed a production company named Truth. He hired a new co-producer and Keyboardist, Patrick Moten who worked with Ike Turner and Natalie Cole, and released the album &quot;Roads of Life&quot; on Arista Records in 1979.

In 1980, Wilton Felder released the album &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; on MCA Records, which featured Womack. He had a soulful song featuring on the Wilton Felder single &quot;(No Matter How High I Get) I&#x27;ll Still Be Looking Up to You&quot;, which was originally recorded in 1979 as a bonus track for the same 1980 album although it was officially released in 1985. This song became a soul classic, notably in the UK—Robbie Vincent at Radio London included the track as one of his all-time winners in October 1982. In 1981, Womack signed with Beverly Glen Records and had his first R&amp;B top 10 single in five years—since the 1976 single &quot;Daylight&quot;—with &quot;If You Think You&#x27;re Lonely Now&quot; that peaked at number three on the R&amp;B singles chart. His accompanying album &quot;The Poet&quot; reached number one on the R&amp;B album charts and is now seen as the high point of his long career, bringing him wider acclaim not only in the U.S. but also in Europe. He had two more R&amp;B top 10 singles during the 1980s including the Patti LaBelle duet, &quot;Love Has Finally Come at Last&quot; (1984), and &quot;I Wish He Didn&#x27;t Trust Me So Much&quot; (1985). In 1986, Bobby recorded the song &quot;Living in a Box&quot; with new group Living in a Box.

===1990–2014: Later career===

In 1993 Bobby Womack and Lulu released song &quot;I&#x27;m Back for More&quot;. Womack&#x27;s solo career started to slow down after 1994. In the mid-1990s, he released his twentieth studio album, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, on his close friend&#x27;s Ronnie Wood&#x27;s label. The album included session background work from admiring associates that included Rod Stewart, Ronald Isley, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts. His remaining brothers from the Valentinos, Curtis, Friendly and Cecil, featured as background singers. Two singles from the album—a duet with Ronald Isley, &quot;Tryin&#x27; Not to Break Down&quot;, and &quot;Forever Love&quot;—appeared on the Billboard R&amp;B chart, but although the album contained two of Womack&#x27;s best latter songs, &quot;Cousin Henry&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Break Your Promise (Too Soon)&quot;, the album received a mixed critical reception. Judges sitting in the high court in London in 2003 ruled that Bobby Womack stole the song &quot;Cry Myself to Sleep&quot; which appeared on the album from Liverpool musician and songwriter Mark Thomas, who never received the outstanding royalty payments due to him.

A gospel album, &quot;Back to My Roots&quot;, appeared at the end of the decade, but Womack largely concentrated on session and guest work for the next ten years.

In 1986, The Manhattans released the album &quot;Back To Basics&quot;, which contained songs written and produced by Womack. Womack contributed vocals and acoustic guitar to the songs &quot;Where Did We Go Wrong&quot; (duet with Regina Belle), &quot;I&#x27;m Through Trying to Prove My Love to You&quot;, &quot;Mr D.J.&quot; and &quot;Back into the Night&quot;.

He is the featured vocalist on June Yamagishi&#x27;s &quot;My Pleasure&quot; album, on &quot;Inherit The Wind&quot;, a track credited to Wilton Felder, and with Allen Toussaint on &quot;Sputin&quot;, and he contributed vocals to Rae &amp; Christian&#x27;s version of &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;. Other collaborations included &quot;You Got What It Takes&quot; with Diane Schuur, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like The Lovin&#x27; We Got&quot; with Shirley Brown, &quot;Break the Chain&quot; with Andrew Love &amp; Wayne Jackson and &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot; with Jeanie Tracy.

In 1989, Womack sang on Todd Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;For the Want of a Nail&quot; on the album &quot;Nearly Human&quot;. In 1998, he performed George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Summertime&quot; with The Roots for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;, a tribute to Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.

In October 1992, Womack held four tribute concert for his friend Eddie Kendricks. Womack planned the concert before Kendricks, who suffered from lung cancer, died on October 5, 1992. Womack headlined the concert; other performers included Chaka Khan, Mary Wilson, and Bill Withers.

In 2010, Womack contributed lyrics and sang on &quot;Stylo&quot; alongside Mos Def, the first single from the third Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;. Womack was told to sing whatever was on his mind during the recording of &quot;Stylo&quot;. &quot;I was in there for an hour going crazy about love and politics, getting it off my chest,&quot; said Womack. He also provided vocals on the song &quot;Cloud of Unknowing&quot; in addition to the song &quot;Bobby in Phoenix&quot; on their December 2010 release &quot;The Fall&quot;.

A new album was released on June 12, 2012, by XL Recordings. The album, &quot;The Bravest Man in the Universe&quot;, was produced by Damon Albarn and Richard Russell. The first Song &quot;Please Forgive My Heart&quot; was offered as a free download on XL Recordings&#x27; official website on March 8, 2012. Contact Music reported that Womack was working on a blues album called &quot;Living in the House of Blues&quot;, featuring collaborations with Stevie Wonder, Snoop Dogg, and Rod Stewart. In an interview with &quot;Uncut&quot;, Womack revealed that the follow-up album would now be called &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; and feature Teena Marie and Ronnie Isley.

Womack sang a duet with Van Morrison titled &quot;Some Peace of Mind&quot; on Morrison&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;&quot;. Womack collaborated with Rudimental on &quot;New Day&quot;, a song taken from their second studio album, &quot;We the Generation&quot;. He had expressed an interest in working with the group, and they had exchanged ideas. Following Womack&#x27;s death, his wife sent the group an a cappella vocal that he had recorded for them, and they pieced together the track.

Womack&#x27;s final concert was June 14, 2014, at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.

==Personal life==

=== Marriages ===
On February 26, 1965, 77 days after Sam Cooke&#x27;s death, 20-year-old Womack and Cooke&#x27;s widow Barbara Cooke, who was 10 years his senior, attempted to marry at the Los Angeles county courthouse. Womack wore one of Cooke&#x27;s suits to the courthouse and the media was present to record the event, but their application was rejected. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot;, it was denied because Womack was under 21 years old and did not have his parents&#x27; permission to marry. They were finally married on March 5, the day after his 21st birthday. Their marriage was considered a scandal by some in the music business and Womack found himself ostracized in the soul music world. Womack&#x27;s brothers turned against him, as did his audiences and disc jockeys. Cooke&#x27;s family was also enraged. His brothers Charles and David Cook broke Womack&#x27;s jaw during an attack at a hotel in Chicago. Womack later claimed he initially went to Barbara&#x27;s side to console her following Cooke&#x27;s death for fear that if she were left alone, she would &quot;do something crazy.&quot;

In 1970, Womack and Barbara separated after she discovered he was having an affair with his 17-year-old stepdaughter Linda Cooke (daughter of Barbara and Sam Cooke). In the ensuing tussle, Barbara fired a gun at her husband and the bullet grazed his head. Their divorce was finalized in 1971. According to Womack, Linda never spoke to her mother again.

Womack married his second wife Evelyn Evans when he was 29. She was his personal secretary.

On December 31, 1975, Womack married his third wife, 19-year-old Regina Banks. Together they had three children. In the early 1990s, Regina left him and went to New York. They later remarried in 2013.

=== Children ===
Womack had six children, with two passing away before him.

Womack&#x27;s firstborn from his marriage to Barbara, Vincent Dwayne Womack, was born in 1966. He died by suicide at the age of 21 by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Barbara had two daughters from her previous marriage to Sam Cooke, Tracy and Linda. She also had a son, Vincent Lance Cooke (1961–1963), who drowned in the family pool aged 18 months.

Womack had two sons Truth Bobby (1978–1978) and Bobby Truth, and a daughter, GinaRe, with his wife Regina. Truth Bobby, whose name was suggested by Womack&#x27;s friend Sly Stone, died aged 4 months old after falling into a coma when he was found &quot;wedged between the wall and the bed.&quot; His death caused Womack to delve deeper into drug addiction. Bobby Truth got involved with gangs and was sent to a youth detention center at about 11 or 12 years old.

Womack fathered two sons, Cory and Jordan, from his relationship with Jody Laba.

=== Family ===
In 1974, Bobby&#x27;s brother Harry Womack was fatally stabbed in the neck with a steak knife by his girlfriend Patricia Wilson in a jealous rage. She had found another woman&#x27;s clothes in a room he was occupying at Bobby&#x27;s house. It turned out that the clothes actually belonged to Bobby&#x27;s girlfriend. After his death, Bobby established the Harry James Womack Memorial Scholarship Fund in his memory. The $50,000 scholarship fund was to aid minority students complete college, because Harry had always &quot;wished he had gone on and gotten a degree.&quot;

Bobby&#x27;s former stepdaughter, Linda Cooke, co-wrote his 1972 hit song &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gotta Have It.&quot; They collaborated in the late 1970s for her planned debut album. She married Bobby&#x27;s younger brother Cecil Womack, and the duo teamed up as Womack &amp; Womack. The song &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Scared of You&quot; by Womack &amp; Womack, from their album &quot;Love Wars&quot;, was released as a single in 1983.

===Drug addiction and health issues===
Womack opened up about his frequent drug use in his memoir, &quot;Midnight Mover&quot;. Womack said he began using cocaine sometime in the late 1960s. He had become close friends with Sly Stone, and was an enthusiastic participant in Stone&#x27;s infamous drug binges. Womack told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1984: &quot;I was really off into the drugs. Blowing as much coke as I could blow. And drinking. And smoking weed and taking pills. Doing that all day, staying up seven, eight days. Me and Sly [Stone] were running partners.&quot;

In 1974, Womack experienced &quot;temporary blindness&quot; after he suffered a concussion from a blow to his head when he flipped backwards over an amplifier during a recording session.

His cocaine use turned into an addiction by the late 1970s. Womack partially attributed his drug addiction to his infant son Truth&#x27;s death in 1978, which he said changed him forever. Throughout most of the 1980s, Womack struggled with a worsening addiction. During this period his career slowed down significantly, partly as a result of his drug usage. In 1985, after completing 14 one-nighters, Womack was hospitalized after experiencing a blood circulation problem in his left leg. Toward the end of the 1980s, he went into a rehabilitation center to get over his cocaine addiction, which he said he conquered.

Womack survived prostate cancer. A series of health problems would follow, including diabetes, pneumonia, colon cancer, and early signs of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Womack developed diabetes in his later years. It was revealed in March 2012 that Womack was diagnosed with colon cancer after Bootsy Collins reported it on his Facebook page. Womack announced afterwards that he was to undergo cancer surgery. On May 24, 2012, it was announced that Womack&#x27;s surgery to remove a tumor from his colon was successful and he was declared cancer free. On January 1, 2013, Womack admitted that he struggled to remember his songs and other people&#x27;s names, and later he was diagnosed with early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Death==
Womack died at his home in Tarzana, California, at the age of 70 on June 27, 2014. He was cremated, and his ashes were inurned at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Memorial Terrace Columbarium.

==Musical legacy==
In 2009, Calvin Richardson was chosen to record a tribute album to Womack to coincide with Womack&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Grammy-nominated album was entitled &quot;Facts of Life: The Soul of Bobby Womack&quot;. It reached No. 30 on the US R&amp;B chart.

In early 2012, Womack&#x27;s career was the subject of the documentary show &quot;Unsung&quot; on TV One. 

==Awards and nominations==
In 2009, Womack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, his original vocal group, his brothers, The Valentinos (Friendly Womack Jr., Curtis Womack, Harry Womack and Cecil Womack), were not inducted with him.

In 2011, Womack received his first Grammy nomination for Best Short-Form Music Video for &quot;Stylo&quot; shared with Mos Def &amp; Gorillaz.

<text>Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. (; August 29, 1809 – October 7, 1894) was an American physician, poet, and polymath based in Boston. Grouped among the fireside poets, he was acclaimed by his peers as one of the best writers of the day. His most famous prose works are the &quot;Breakfast-Table&quot; series, which began with &quot;The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table&quot; (1858). He was also an important medical reformer. In addition to his work as an author and poet, Holmes also served as a physician, professor, lecturer, and inventor.

Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Holmes was educated at Phillips Academy and Harvard College. After graduating from Harvard in 1829, he briefly studied law before turning to the medical profession. He began writing poetry at an early age; one of his most famous works, &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, was published in 1830 and was influential in the eventual preservation of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;. Following training at the prestigious medical schools of Paris, Holmes was granted his Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard Medical School in 1836. He taught at Dartmouth Medical School before returning to teach at Harvard and, for a time, served as dean there. During his long professorship, he became an advocate for various medical reforms and notably posited the controversial idea that doctors were capable of carrying puerperal fever from patient to patient. Holmes retired from Harvard in 1882 and continued writing poetry, novels and essays until his death in 1894.

Surrounded by Boston&#x27;s literary elite—which included friends such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell—Holmes made an indelible imprint on the literary world of the 19th century. Many of his works were published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, a magazine that he named. For his literary achievements and other accomplishments, he was awarded numerous honorary degrees from universities around the world. Holmes&#x27;s writing often commemorated his native Boston area, and much of it was meant to be humorous or conversational. Some of his medical writings, notably his 1843 essay regarding the contagiousness of puerperal fever, were considered innovative for their time. He was often called upon to issue occasional poetry, or poems written specifically for an event, including many occasions at Harvard. Holmes also popularized several terms, including &quot;Boston Brahmin&quot; and &quot;anesthesia&quot;. He was the father of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who would become a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Life and education==

===Early life and family===

Holmes was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 29, 1809. His birthplace, a house just north of Harvard Yard, was said to have been the place where the Battle of Bunker Hill was planned. He was the first son of Abiel Holmes (1763–1837), minister of the First Congregational Church and avid historian, and Sarah Wendell, Abiel&#x27;s second wife. Sarah was the daughter of a wealthy family, and Holmes was named for his maternal grandfather, a judge. The first Wendell, Evert Jansen, left the Netherlands in 1640 and settled in Albany, New York. Also through his mother, Holmes was descended from Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet and his wife, Anne Bradstreet (daughter of Thomas Dudley), the first published American poet.

From a young age, Holmes was small and had asthma, but he was known for his precociousness. When he was eight, he took his five-year-old brother, John, to witness the last hanging in Cambridge&#x27;s Gallows Lot and was subsequently scolded by his parents. He also enjoyed exploring his father&#x27;s library, writing later in life that &quot;it was very largely theological, so that I was walled in by solemn folios making the shelves bend under the load of sacred learning.&quot; After being exposed to poets such as John Dryden, Alexander Pope and Oliver Goldsmith, the young Holmes began to compose and recite his own verse. His first recorded poem, which was copied down by his father, was written when he was 13.

Although a talented student, the young Holmes was often admonished by his teachers for his talkative nature and habit of reading stories during school hours. He studied under Dame Prentiss and William Bigelow before enrolling in what was called the &quot;Port School&quot;, a select private academy in the Cambridgeport settlement. One of his schoolmates was future critic and author Margaret Fuller, whose intellect Holmes admired.

===Education===
Holmes&#x27;s father sent him to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, at the age of 15. Abiel chose Phillips, which was known for its orthodox Calvinist teachings, because he hoped his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Holmes had no interest in becoming a theologian, however, and as a result he did not enjoy his single year at Andover. Although he achieved distinction as an elected member of the Social Fraternity, a literary club, he disliked the &quot;bigoted, narrow-minded, uncivilized&quot; attitudes of most of the school&#x27;s teachers. One teacher in particular, however, noted his young student&#x27;s talent for poetry, and suggested that he pursue it. Shortly after his sixteenth birthday, Holmes was accepted by Harvard College.
As a member of Harvard&#x27;s class of 1829, Holmes lived at home for the first few years of his college career rather than in the dormitories. Since he measured only &quot;five feet three inches when standing in a pair of substantial boots&quot;, the young student had no interest in joining a sports team or the Harvard Washington Corps. Instead, he allied himself with the &quot;Aristocrats&quot; or &quot;Puffmaniacs&quot;, a group of students who gathered in order to smoke and talk. As a town student and the son of a minister, however, he was able to move between social groups. He also became a friend of Charles Chauncy Emerson (brother of Ralph Waldo Emerson), who was a year older. During second year, Holmes was one of 20 students awarded the scholastic honor &quot;Deturs&quot;, which came with a copy of &quot;The Poems of James Graham, John Logan, and William Falconer&quot;. Despite his scholastic achievements, the young scholar admitted to a schoolmate from Andover that he did not &quot;study as hard as I ought to&#x27;. He did, however, excel in languages and took classes in French, Italian and Spanish.

Holmes&#x27;s academic interests and hobbies were divided among law, medicine, and writing. He was elected to the Hasty Pudding, where he served as Poet and Secretary, and to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. With two friends, he collaborated on a small book entitled &quot;Poetical Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Painting&quot;, which was a collection of satirical poems about the new art gallery in Boston. He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class&#x27;s commencement and wrote a &quot;light and sarcastic&quot; poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he lived at home and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time). By January 1830, however, he was disenchanted with legal studies. &quot;I am sick at heart of this place and almost everything connected to it&quot;, he wrote. &quot;I know not what the temple of law may be to those who have entered it, but to me it seems very cold and cheerless about the threshold.&quot;

===Poetic beginnings===
1830 proved to be an important year for Holmes as a poet; while disappointed by his law studies, he began writing poetry for his own amusement. Before the end of the year, he had produced over fifty poems, contributing twenty-five of them (all unsigned) to &quot;The Collegian&quot;, a short-lived publication started by friends from Harvard. Four of these poems would ultimately become among his best-known: &quot;The Dorchester Giant&quot;, &quot;Reflections of a Proud Pedestrian&quot;, &quot;Evening / By a Tailor&quot; and &quot;The Height of the Ridiculous&quot;. Nine more of his poems were published anonymously in the 1830 pamphlet &quot;Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Paintings&quot;.
In September of that same year, Holmes read a short article in the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot; about the 18th-century frigate USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, which was to be dismantled by the Navy. Holmes was moved to write &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; in opposition to the ship&#x27;s scrapping. The patriotic poem was published in the &quot;Advertiser&quot; the very next day and was soon printed by papers in New York, Philadelphia and Washington. It not only brought the author immediate national attention, but the three-stanza poem also generated so much public sentiment that the historic ship was preserved, though plans to do so may have already been in motion.

During the rest of the year, Holmes published only five more poems. His last major poem that year was &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;, which was inspired in part by a local man named Thomas Melvill, &quot;the last of the cocked hats&quot; and one of the &quot;Indians&quot; from the 1774 Boston Tea Party. Holmes would later write that Melvill had reminded him of &quot;a withered leaf which has held to its stem through the storms of autumn and winter, and finds itself still clinging to its bough while the new growths of spring are bursting their buds and spreading their foliage all around it.&quot; Literary critic Edgar Allan Poe called the poem one of the finest works in the English language. Years later, Abraham Lincoln would also become a fan of the poem; William Herndon, Lincoln&#x27;s law partner and biographer, wrote in 1867: &quot;I have heard Lincoln recite it, praise it, laud it, and swear by it&quot;.

Holmes published in &quot;The Token&quot; annual gift book in 1831, 1833, and 1837. Despite his early literary success, Holmes did not consider turning to a literary profession. Later he would write that he had &quot;tasted the intoxicating pleasure of authorship&quot; but compared such contentment to a sickness, saying: &quot;there is no form of lead-poisoning which more rapidly and thoroughly pervades the blood and bones and marrow than that which reaches the young author through mental contact with type metal&quot;.

==Medical career==
===Medical training===
Having given up on the study of law, Holmes switched to medicine. After leaving his childhood home in Cambridge during the autumn of 1830, he moved into a boardinghouse in Boston to attend the city&#x27;s medical college. At that time, students studied only five subjects: medicine, anatomy and surgery, obstetrics, chemistry and &quot;materia medica&quot;. Holmes became a student of James Jackson, a physician and the father of a friend, and worked part-time as a chemist in the hospital dispensary. Dismayed by the &quot;painful and repulsive aspects&quot; of primitive medical treatment of the time—which included practices such as bloodletting and blistering—Holmes responded favorably to his mentor&#x27;s teachings, which emphasized close observation of the patient and humane approaches. Despite his lack of free time, he was able to continue writing. He wrote two essays during this time which detailed life as seen from his boardinghouse&#x27;s breakfast table. These essays, which would evolve into one of Holmes&#x27;s most popular works, were published in November 1831 and February 1832 in &quot;The New-England Magazine&quot; under the title &quot;The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table&quot;.

In 1833, Holmes traveled to Paris to further his medical studies. Recent and radical reorganization of the city&#x27;s hospital system had made medical training there highly advanced for the time. At twenty-three years old, Holmes was one of the first Americans trained in the new &quot;clinical&quot; method being advanced at the famed École de Médecine. Since the lectures were taught entirely in French, he engaged a private language tutor. Although far from home, he stayed connected to his family and friends through letters and visitors (such as Ralph Waldo Emerson). He quickly acclimated to his new surroundings. While writing to his father, he stated, &quot;I love to talk French, to eat French, to drink French every now and then.&quot;

At the hospital of La Pitié, he studied under internal pathologist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, who demonstrated the ineffectiveness of bloodletting, which had been a mainstay of medical practice since antiquity. Louis was one of the fathers of the &quot;méthode expectante&quot;, a therapeutic doctrine that states the physician&#x27;s role is to do everything possible to aid nature in the process of disease recovery, and to do nothing to hinder this natural process. Upon his return to Boston, Holmes became one of the country&#x27;s leading proponents of the &quot;méthode expectante&quot;. Holmes was awarded his Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard in 1836; he wrote his dissertation on acute pericarditis. His first collection of poetry was published later that year, but Holmes, ready to begin his medical career, wrote it off as a one-time event. In the book&#x27;s introduction, he mused: &quot;Already engaged in other duties, it has been with some effort that I have found time to adjust my own mantle; and I now willingly retire to more quiet labors, which, if less exciting, are more certain to be acknowledged as useful and received with gratitude&quot;.

===Medical reformer===
After graduation, Holmes quickly became a fixture in the local medical scene by joining the Massachusetts Medical Society, the Boston Medical Society, and the Boston Society for Medical Improvement—an organization composed of young, Paris-trained doctors. He also gained a greater reputation after winning Harvard Medical School&#x27;s prestigious Boylston Prize, for which he submitted a paper on the benefits of using the stethoscope, a device with which many American doctors were not familiar.

In 1837, Holmes was appointed to the Boston Dispensary, where he was shocked by the poor hygienic conditions. That year he competed for and won both of the Boylston essay prizes. Wishing to concentrate on research and teaching, he, along with three of his peers, established the Tremont Medical School—which would later merge with Harvard Medical School—above an apothecary shop at 35 Tremont Row in Boston. There, he lectured on pathology, taught the use of microscopes, and supervised dissections of cadavers. He often criticized traditional medical practices and once quipped that if all contemporary medicine was tossed into the sea &quot;it would be all the better for mankind—and all the worse for the fishes&quot;. For the next ten years, he maintained a small and irregular private medical practice, but spent much of his time teaching. He served on the faculty of Dartmouth Medical School from 1838 to 1840, where he was appointed professor of anatomy and physiology. For fourteen weeks each fall, during these years, he traveled to Hanover, New Hampshire, to lecture. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1838.

After Holmes resigned his professorship at Dartmouth, he composed a series of three lectures dedicated to exposing medical fallacies, or &quot;quackeries&quot;. Adopting a more serious tone than his previous lectures, he took great pains to reveal the false reasoning and misrepresentation of evidence that marked subjects such as &quot;Astrology and Alchemy&quot;, his first lecture, and &quot;Medical Delusions of the Past&quot;, his second. He deemed homeopathy, the subject of his third lecture, &quot;the pretended science&quot; that was a &quot;mingled mass of perverse ingenuity, of tinsel erudition, of imbecile credulity, and of artful misrepresentation, too often mingled in practice&quot;. In 1842, he published the essay &quot;Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions&quot; in which he again denounced the practice.

In 1846, Holmes coined the word &quot;anaesthesia&quot;. In a letter to dentist William T. G. Morton, the first practitioner to publicly demonstrate the use of ether during surgery, he wrote:
Holmes predicted his new term &quot;will be repeated by the tongues of every civilized race of mankind.&quot;

===Study of childbed fever===
In 1842 Holmes attended a lecture by Walter Channing to the Boston Society for Medical Improvement about puerperal fever, or &quot;childbed fever&quot;, a disease which at the time was a significant cause of mortality of women after delivering children. Becoming interested in the subject, Holmes spent a year going through case reports and other medical literature on the subject to ascertain the cause and possible prevention of the condition. In 1843, he presented his research to the society, which he then published as a paper &quot;The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever&quot; in the short-lived publication &quot;New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery&quot;. The essay argued—contrary to popular belief at the time, which predated germ theory of disease—that the cause of puerperal fever, a deadly infection contracted by women during or shortly after childbirth, stems from patient-to-patient contact via their physicians. He believed that bed sheets, washcloths and articles of clothing were of particular concern in this regard. Holmes gathered a large collection of evidence for this theory, including stories of doctors who had become ill and died after performing autopsies on patients who had likewise been infected. In concluding his case, he insisted that a physician in whose practice even one case of puerperal fever had occurred, had a moral obligation to purify his instruments, burn the clothing he had worn while assisting in the fatal delivery, and cease obstetric practice for a period of at least six months.

Though it largely escaped notice when first published, Holmes eventually came under attack by two distinguished professors of obstetrics—Hugh L. Hodge and Charles D. Meigs—who adamantly denied his theory of contagion. In 1855, Holmes published a revised version of the essay in the form of a pamphlet under the new title &quot;Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence&quot;, and discussing additional cases. In a new introduction, in which Holmes directly addressed his opponents, he wrote: &quot;I had rather rescue one mother from being poisoned by her attendant, than claim to have saved forty out of fifty patients to whom I had carried the disease.&quot; He added, &quot;I beg to be heard in behalf of the women whose lives are at stake, until some stronger voice shall plead for them.&quot;

A few years later, Ignaz Semmelweis would reach similar conclusions in Vienna, where his introduction of prophylaxis (handwashing in chlorine solution before assisting at delivery) would considerably lower the puerperal mortality rate, and the then-controversial work is now considered a landmark in germ theory of disease.

===Teaching and lecturing===
In 1847, Holmes was hired as Parkman Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard Medical School, where he served as dean until 1853 and taught until 1882. Soon after his appointment, Holmes was criticized by the all-male student body for considering granting admission to a woman named Harriot Kezia Hunt. Facing opposition from not only students but also university overseers and other faculty members, she was asked to withdraw her application. Harvard Medical School would not admit a woman until 1945. Holmes&#x27;s training in Paris led him to teach his students the importance of anatomico-pathological basis of disease, and that &quot;no doctrine of prayer or special providence is to be his excuse for not looking straight at secondary causes.&quot; Students were fond of Holmes, to whom they referred as &quot;Uncle Oliver&quot;. One teaching assistant recalled:
==Marriage, family, and later life==

On June 15, 1840, Holmes married Amelia Lee Jackson at King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston. She was the daughter of the Hon. Charles Jackson, formerly Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and the niece of James Jackson, the physician with whom Holmes had studied. Judge Jackson gave the couple a house at 8 Montgomery Place, which would be their home for eighteen years. They had three children: Civil War officer and American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (1841–1935), Amelia Jackson Holmes (1843–1889), and Edward Jackson Holmes (1846–1884).
Amelia Holmes inherited $2,000 in 1848, and she and her husband used the money to build a summer house in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Beginning in July 1849, the family spent &quot;seven blessed summers&quot; there. Having recently given up his private medical practice, Holmes was able to socialize with other literary figures who spent time in The Berkshires; in August 1850, for example, Holmes spent time with Evert Augustus Duyckinck, Cornelius Mathews, Herman Melville, James T. Fields and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Holmes enjoyed measuring the circumference of trees on his property and kept track of the data, writing that he had &quot;a most intense, passionate fondness for trees in general, and have had several romantic attachments to certain trees in particular&quot;. The high cost of maintaining their home in Pittsfield caused the Holmes family to sell it in May 1856.

While serving as dean in 1850, Holmes became a witness for both the defense and prosecution during the notorious Parkman–Webster murder case. Both George Parkman (the victim), a local physician and wealthy benefactor, and John Webster (the assailant) were graduates of Harvard, and Webster was professor of chemistry at the Medical School during the time of the highly publicized murder. Webster was convicted and hanged. Holmes dedicated his November 1850 introductory lecture at the Medical School to Parkman&#x27;s memory.

The same year, Holmes was approached by Martin Delany, an African-American man who had worked with Frederick Douglass. The 38-year-old requested admission to Harvard after having been previously rejected by four schools despite impressive credentials. In a controversial move, Holmes admitted Delany and two other black men to the Medical School. Their admission sparked a student statement, which read: &quot;Resolved That we have no objection to the education and evaluation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us.&quot; Sixty students signed the resolution, although 48 students signed another resolution which noted it would be &quot;a far greater evil, if, in the present state of public feeling, a medical college in Boston could refuse to this unfortunate class any privileges of education, which it is in the power of the profession to bestow&quot;. In response, Holmes told the black students they would not be able to continue after that semester. A faculty meeting directed Holmes to write that &quot;the intermixing of races is distasteful to a large portion of the class, &amp; injurious to the interests of the school&quot;. Despite his support of education for blacks, he was not an abolitionist; against what he considered the abolitionists&#x27; habit of using &quot;every form of language calculated to inflame&quot;, he felt that the movement was going too far. This lack of support dismayed friends like James Russell Lowell, who once told Holmes he should be more outspoken against slavery. Holmes calmly responded, &quot;Let me try to improve and please my fellowmen after my own fashion at present.&quot; Nonetheless, Holmes believed that slavery could be ended peacefully and legally.

Holmes regarded Native Americans as &quot;a sketch in red crayon of a rudimental manhood&quot;. As to the &quot;problem of his relation to the white race&quot;, Holmes saw only one solution: &quot;extermination&quot;.

Holmes lectured extensively from 1851 to 1856 on subjects such as &quot;Medical Science as It Is or Has Been&quot;, &quot;Lectures and Lecturing&quot;, and &quot;English Poets of the Nineteenth Century&quot;. Traveling throughout New England, he received anywhere from $40 to $100 per lecture, but he also published a great deal during this time, and the British edition of his &quot;Poems&quot; sold well abroad. As social attitudes began to change, however, Holmes often found himself publicly at odds with those he called the &quot;moral bullies&quot;; because of mounting criticisms from the press regarding Holmes&#x27;s vocal anti-abolitionism, as well as his dislike of the growing temperance movement, he chose to discontinue his lecturing and return home.

===Later literary success and the Civil War===
In 1856, the Atlantic or Saturday Club was created to launch and support &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. This new magazine was edited by Holmes&#x27;s friend James Russell Lowell, and articles were contributed by the New England literary elite such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Lothrop Motley and J. Elliot Cabot. Holmes not only provided its name, but also wrote various pieces for the journal throughout the years. For the magazine&#x27;s first issue, Holmes produced a new version of two of his earlier essays, &quot;The Autocrat at the Breakfast-Table&quot;. Based upon fictionalized breakfast table talk and including poetry, stories, jokes and songs, the work was favored by readers and critics alike and it secured the initial success of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The essays were collected as a book of the same name in 1858 and became his most enduring work, selling ten thousand copies in three days. Its sequel, &quot;The Professor at the Breakfast-Table&quot;, was released shortly after beginning in serialized installments in January 1859.
Holmes&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Elsie Venner&quot;, was published serially in the &quot;Atlantic&quot; beginning in December 1859. Originally entitled &quot;The Professor&#x27;s Story&quot;, the novel is about a neurotic young woman whose mother was bitten by a rattlesnake while pregnant, making her daughter&#x27;s personality half-woman, half-snake. The novel drew a wide range of comments, including praise from John Greenleaf Whittier and condemnation from church papers, which claimed the work a product of heresy.

Also in December 1859, Holmes sent medication to the ailing writer Washington Irving after visiting him at his Sunnyside home in New York; Irving died only a few months later. The Massachusetts Historical Society posthumously awarded Irving an honorary membership at a tribute held on December 15, 1859. At the ceremony, Holmes presented an account of his meeting with Irving and a list of medical symptoms he had observed, despite the taboo of discussing health publicly.

About 1860, Holmes invented the &quot;American stereoscope&quot;, a 19th-century entertainment in which pictures were viewed in 3-D. He later wrote an explanation for its popularity, stating: &quot;There was not any wholly new principle involved in its construction, but, it proved so much more convenient than any hand-instrument in use, that it gradually drove them all out of the field, in great measure, at least so far as the Boston market was concerned.&quot; Rather than patenting the hand stereopticon and profiting from its success, Holmes gave the idea away.

Soon after South Carolina&#x27;s secession from the Union in 1861 and the start of the Civil War, Holmes began publishing pieces—the first of which was the patriotic song &quot;A Voice of the Loyal North&quot;—in support of the Union cause. Although he had previously criticized the abolitionists, deeming them traitorous, his main concern was for the preservation of the Union. In September of that year, he published an article titled &quot;Bread and Newspapers&quot; in the &quot;Atlantic&quot;, in which he proudly identified himself as an ardent Unionist. He wrote, &quot;War has taught us, as nothing else could, what we can be and are&quot; and inspiring even the upper class to have &quot;courage ... big enough for the uniform which hangs so loosely about their slender figures.&quot; However, on July 4, 1863, Holmes wrote, &quot;how idle it is to look for any other cause than slavery as having any material agency in dividing the country&quot; and declared it as one of &quot;its sins against a just God&quot;. Holmes also had a personal stake in the war: his oldest son, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., enlisted in the Army against his father&#x27;s wishes in April 1861 and was injured three times in battle, including a gunshot wound in his chest at the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff in October 1861. Holmes published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; an account of his search for his son after hearing news of his injury at the Battle of Antietam.
Amid the Civil War, Holmes&#x27;s friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow began translating Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Beginning in 1864, Longfellow invited several friends to help at weekly meetings held on Wednesdays. Holmes was part of that group, which became known as the &quot;Dante Club&quot;; among its members were Longfellow, Lowell, William Dean Howells, and Charles Eliot Norton. The final translation was published in three volumes in the spring of 1867. American novelist Matthew Pearl has fictionalized their efforts in &quot;The Dante Club&quot; (2003). The same year the Dante translation was published, Holmes&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Guardian Angel&quot;, began appearing serially in the &quot;Atlantic&quot;. It was published in book form in November, with its sales half that of &quot;Elsie Venner&quot;&#x27;s.

===Later years and death===
Holmes&#x27;s fame continued through his later years. &quot;The Poet at the Breakfast-Table&quot; was published in 1872. Written fifteen years after &quot;The Autocrat&quot;, this work&#x27;s tone was mellower and more nostalgic than its predecessor; &quot;As people grow older,&quot; Holmes wrote, &quot;they come at length to live so much in memory that they often think with a kind of pleasure of losing their dearest possessions. Nothing can be so perfect while we possess it as it will seem when remembered&quot;. In 1876, at the age of seventy, Holmes published a biography of John Lothrop Motley, which was an extension of an earlier sketch he had written for the Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings. The following year he published a collection of his medical essays and &quot;Pages from an Old Volume of Life&quot;, a collection of various essays he had previously written for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1880. He retired from Harvard Medical School in 1882 after thirty-five years as a professor. After he gave his final lecture on November 28, the university made him professor emeritus.
In 1884, Holmes published a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes&#x27;s book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson&#x27;s poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes&#x27;s third and last novel, &quot;A Mortal Antipathy&quot;, was published serially in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, though he did not approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a shut-in.

Exhausted and mourning the sudden death of his youngest son, Holmes began postponing his writing and social engagements. In late 1884, he embarked on a visit to Europe with his daughter Amelia. In Great Britain he met with writers such as Henry James, George du Maurier and Alfred Tennyson, and was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Cambridge, a Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Edinburgh, and a third honorary degree from the University of Oxford. Holmes and Amelia then visited Paris, a place that had significantly influenced him in his earlier years. He met with chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur, whose previous studies in germ theory had helped reduce the mortality rate of women who had puerperal fever. Holmes called Pasteur &quot;one of the truest benefactors of his race&quot;. After returning to the United States, Holmes published a travelogue, &quot;Our One Hundred Days in Europe&quot;.

In June 1886, Holmes received an honorary degree from Yale University Law School. His wife of more than forty years, who had struggled with an illness that had kept her an invalid for months, died on February 6, 1888. The younger Amelia died the following year after a brief malady. Despite his weakening eyesight and a fear that he was becoming antiquated, Holmes continued to find solace in writing. He published &quot;Over the Teacups&quot;, the last of his table-talk books, in 1891.
Towards the end of his life, Holmes noted that he had outlived most of his friends, including Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. As he said, &quot;I feel like my own survivor ... We were on deck together as we began the voyage of life ... Then the craft which held us began going to pieces.&quot; His last public appearance was at a reception for the National Education Association in Boston on February 23, 1893, where he presented the poem &quot;To the Teachers of America&quot;. A month later, Holmes wrote to Harvard president Charles William Eliot that the university should consider adopting the honorary doctor of letters degree and offer one to Samuel Francis Smith, though one was never issued.

Holmes died quietly after falling asleep in the afternoon of Sunday, October 7, 1894. As his son Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote, &quot;His death was as peaceful as one could wish for those one loves. He simply ceased to breathe.&quot; Holmes&#x27;s memorial service was held at King&#x27;s Chapel and overseen by Edward Everett Hale. Holmes was buried alongside his wife in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Writing==

===Poetry===
Holmes is one of the fireside poets, together with William Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and John Greenleaf Whittier. These poets—whose writing was characterized as family-friendly and conventional—were among the first Americans to build substantial popularity in Europe. Holmes in particular believed poetry had &quot;the power of transfiguring the experiences and shows of life into an aspect which comes from the imagination and kindles that of others&quot;.

Due to his immense popularity during his lifetime, Holmes was often called upon to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was &quot;a florist in verse, and what &quot;would&quot; people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?&quot; As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, &quot;very little ... survives the occasions that produced it&quot;. Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be &quot;a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would be surprised at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions&quot;.

In addition to the commemorative nature of much of Holmes&#x27;s poetry, some pieces were written based on his observations of the world around him. This is the case with two of Holmes&#x27;s best known and critically successful poems—&quot;Old Ironsides&quot; and &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;—which were published when he was a young adult. As is seen with poems such as &quot;The Chambered Nautilus&quot; and &quot; &quot;or&quot; The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay&quot;, Holmes successfully concentrated his verse upon concrete objects with which he was long familiar, or had studied at length, such as the one-horse shay or a seashell. Some of his works also deal with his personal or family history; for example, the poem &quot;Dorothy Q&quot; is a portrait of his maternal great-grandmother. The poem combines pride, humor and tenderness in short rhyming couplets:

Holmes, an outspoken critic of over-sentimental Transcendentalist and Romantic poetry, often slipped into sentimentality when writing his occasional poetry, but would often balance such emotional excess with humor. Critic George Warren Arms believed Holmes&#x27;s poetry to be provincial in nature, noting his &quot;New England homeliness&quot; and &quot;Puritan familiarity with household detail&quot; as proof. In his poetry, Holmes often connected the theme of nature to human relations and social teachings; poems such as &quot;The Ploughman&quot; and &quot;The New Eden&quot;, which were delivered in commemoration of Pittsfield&#x27;s scenic countryside, were even quoted in the 1863 edition of the &quot;Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;.

He composed several hymn texts, including Thou Gracious God, Whose Mercy Lends and Lord of All Being, Throned Afar.

===Prose===
Although mainly known as a poet, Holmes wrote numerous medical treatises, essays, novels, memoirs and table-talk books. His prose works include topics that range from medicine to theology, psychology, society, democracy, sex and gender, and the natural world. Author and critic William Dean Howells argued that Holmes created a genre called dramatized (or discursive) essay, in which major themes are informed by the story&#x27;s plot, but his works often use a combination of genres; excerpts of poetry, essays and conversations are often included throughout his prose. Critic William Lawrence Schroeder described Holmes&#x27;s prose style as &quot;attractive&quot; in that it &quot;made no great demand on the attention of the reader.&quot; He further stated that although the author&#x27;s earlier works (&quot;The Autocrat&quot; and &quot;The Professor of the Breakfast-Table&quot;) are &quot;virile and fascinating&quot;, later ones such as &quot;Our Hundred Days in Europe&quot; and &quot;Over the Teacups&quot; &quot;have little distinction of style to recommend them.&quot;
Holmes first gained international fame with his &quot;Breakfast-Tables&quot; series. These three table-talk books attracted a diverse audience due to their conversational style, which made readers feel an intimate connection to the author, and resulted in a flood of letters from admirers. The series&#x27; conversational tone is not only meant to mimic the philosophical debates and pleasantries that occur around the breakfast table, but it is also used in order to facilitate an openness of thought and expression. As the Autocrat, Holmes states in the first volume:

The various speakers represent different facets of Holmes&#x27;s life and experiences. The speaker of the first installment, for example, is understood to be a doctor who spent several years studying in Paris, while the second volume—&quot;The Professor at the Breakfast-Table&quot;—is told from the point of view of a professor of a distinguished medical school. Although the speakers discuss myriad topics, the flow of conversation always leads to supporting Holmes&#x27;s Paris-taught conception of science and medicine and how they relate to morality and the mind. &quot;Autocrat&quot; in particular addresses philosophical issues such as the nature of one&#x27;s self, language, life and truth.

Holmes wrote in the second preface to &quot;Elsie Venner&quot;, his first novel, that his aim in writing the work was &quot;to test the doctrine of &#x27;original sin&#x27; and human responsibility for the distorted violation coming under that technical denomination&quot;. He also stated his belief that &quot;a grave scientific doctrine may be detected lying beneath some of the delineations of character&quot; throughout all fiction. Deeming the work a &quot;psychological romance&quot;, he employed a romantic narrative in order to describe moral theology from a scientific perspective. This means of expression is also present in his two other novels, in which Holmes uses medical or psychological dilemmas to further the story&#x27;s dramatic plot.

Holmes referred to his novels as &quot;medicated novels&quot;. Some critics believe that these works were innovative in exploring theories of Sigmund Freud and other emerging psychiatrists and psychologists. &quot;The Guardian Angel&quot;, for example, explores mental health and repressed memory, and Holmes uses the concept of the unconscious mind throughout his works. &quot;A Mortal Antipathy&quot; depicts a character whose phobias are rooted in psychic trauma, later cured by shock therapy. Holmes&#x27;s novels were not critically successful during his lifetime. As psychiatrist Clarence P. Oberndorf, author of &quot;The Psychiatric Novels of Oliver Wendell Holmes&quot;, states, the three works are &quot;poor fiction when judged by modern criteria. ... Their plots are simple, almost juvenile and, in two of them, the reader is not disappointed in the customary thwarting of the villain and the coming of true love to its own&quot;.

==Legacy and criticism==

Holmes was well respected by his peers, and garnered a large, international following throughout his long life. Particularly noted for his intelligence, he was named by American theologian Henry James Sr. &quot;intellectually the most alive man I ever knew&quot;. Critic John G. Palfrey also praised Holmes, referring to him as &quot;a man of genius ... His manner is entirely his own, manly and unaffected; generally easy and playful, and sinking at times into &#x27;a most humorous sadness&#x27;&quot;. On the other hand, critics S. I. Hayakawa and Howard Mumford Jones argued that Holmes was &quot;distinctly an amateur in letters. His literary writings, on the whole, are partly the leisure-born meditations of a physician, partly a means of spreading certain items of professional propaganda, partly a distillation of his social life.&quot;

Like Samuel Johnson in 18th-century England, Holmes was noted for his conversational powers in both his life and literary output. Though he was popular at the national level, Holmes promoted Boston culture and often wrote from a Boston-centric point of view, believing the city was &quot;the thinking centre of the continent, and therefore of the planet&quot;. He is often referred to as a Boston Brahmin, a term that he created while referring to the oldest families in the Boston area. The term, as he used it, referred not only to members of a good family but also implied intellectualism. He also famously nicknamed Emerson&#x27;s &quot;The American Scholar&quot; the American &quot;intellectual Declaration of Independence&quot;.

Although his essay on puerperal fever has been deemed &quot;the most important contribution made in America to the advancement of medicine&quot; up to that time, Holmes is most famous as a humorist and poet. Editor and critic George Ripley, an admirer of Holmes, referred to him as &quot;one of the wittiest and most original of modern poets&quot;. Emerson noted that, though Holmes did not renew his focus on poetry until later in his life, he quickly perfected his role &quot;like old pear trees which have done nothing for ten years, and at last begin to grow great.&quot;

Poems by Holmes, along with those by the other fireside or schoolroom poets, were often required to be memorized by schoolchildren. Although learning by rote recitation began fading out by the 1890s, these poets nevertheless remained fixed as ideal New England poets. Literary scholar Lawrence Buell wrote of these poets: &quot;we value [them] less than the nineteenth century did but still regard as the mainstream of nineteenth-century New England verse.&quot; Many of these poets soon became recognized only as children&#x27;s poets, as noted by a 20th-century scholar who asked about Holmes&#x27;s contemporary Longfellow: &quot;Who, except wretched schoolchildren, now reads Longfellow?&quot; Another modern scholar notes that &quot;Holmes is a casualty of the ongoing movement to revise the literary canon. His work is the least likely of the Fireside Poets to find its way into American literature anthologies.&quot;

The school library of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where Holmes studied as a child, is named the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, or the OWHL, in his memory. Items from Holmes&#x27;s personal library—including medical papers, essays, songs and poems—are held in the library&#x27;s Special Collections department. In 1915, Bostonians placed a memorial seat and sundial behind Holmes&#x27;s final home at 296 Beacon Street in a spot where he would have seen it from his library. King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston, where Holmes worshiped, erected an inscribed memorial tablet in his honor. The tablet notes Holmes&#x27;s achievements in the order he recognized them: &quot;Teacher of Anatomy, Essayist and Poet&quot;. It ends with a quote from Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica: Miscuit Utile Dulci&quot;: &quot;He mingled the useful with the pleasant.&quot;

<doc id="517145" wikidata="Q2476387" url="?curid=517145" title="Chapterhouse (band)">
<text>Chapterhouse were a British shoegaze band from Reading, Berkshire, England. Formed in 1987 by Andrew Sherriff, Stephen Patman and Simon Rowe, the band began performing alongside Spacemen 3. They released two albums: &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1991) and &quot;Blood Music&quot; (1993). The group temporarily reformed in 2008 after being asked to join Ulrich Schnauss onstage to perform his cover version of their song &quot;Love Forever&quot; at the Truck Festival in Oxfordshire. The band finished the brief reunion with two gigs in London (2009–2010) and tours in North America and Japan in 2010.

==Career==
The band comprised Andrew Sherriff (b.16 May 1969, Wokingham, England), Stephen Patman (b. 8 November 1968, Windsor, Berkshire, England), Simon Rowe (b. 23 June 1969, Reading, Berkshire), Jon Curtis and Ashley Bates (b. 2 November 1971, Reading).

Rowe described that Chapterhouse was born from &quot;friendship and common interests&quot; among the founding members: Rowe, Sherriff and Patman. Rowe and Sherriff were next door neighbours who went to the same secondary school with Patman. As teenagers, they used to go to shows such as Cocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Fall and others. The common musical interests the three shared then led them to learn guitar at age 17/18 and to form the band at about age 19.

In 1989, the band moved to London to take a more serious path. They rehearsed and gigged for well over a year before recording a demo tape. They were initially lumped in with the British acid rock genre, eventually becoming a part of the shoegazing scene along with acts such as Lush, Moose, Ride and Slowdive.

Bassist Jon Curtis left the group to study, and was replaced by Russell Barrett (b. 7 November 1968, Vermont, United States) in 1990.

Chapterhouse signed to the newly formed Dedicated label, releasing a series of singles, including &quot;Pearl&quot;, which featured guest vocals by Rachel Goswell of Slowdive and reached No. 67 in the UK Singles Chart. 

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Whirlpool&quot;, released in 1991, has been cited as one of the genre&#x27;s high points, but failed to capture a wider market despite reaching No. 23 in the UK Albums Chart. In the same year, Chapterhouse also appeared in their home town Reading Festival immediately following Nirvana&#x27;s performance.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Blood Music&quot;, which was stylistically different, was released in 1993. According to Rowe, while the first album &quot;originally had a very raw feel&quot; and was made as an attempt by the band to sound like The Stooges live, &quot;Blood Music&quot; was &quot;a different concept altogether&quot;. It had a lot more dance music influences that mainly came into play from Sherriff. Singles from the album &quot;She&#x27;s a Vision&quot; and &quot;We Are the Beautiful&quot; were relatively successful. Some copies of &quot;Blood Music&quot; included a bonus disc &quot;retranslated&quot; by Global Communication, called &quot;Pentamerous Metamorphosis&quot; that was withdrawn due to a sampling lawsuit, but later reissued in a slightly altered version.

The band then released no further new material other than a double album, &quot;Rownderbowt&quot;, in 1996, compiling their singles, various b-sides, rarities and unreleased demos which featured Slowdive drummer Simon Scott. Sherriff went on to form Bio.com and Rowe went on to play guitar for Mojave 3. Bates formed Cuba and now plays in the British folktronica band Tunng, and Chapterhouse ceased for almost fifteen years.

The music of Chapterhouse was mostly out of print on CD until March 2006, when Cherry Red Records reissued the album &quot;Whirlpool&quot; with bonus tracks, and for the first time, lyrics.

The band played a version of &quot;Love Forever&quot; with Ulrich Schnauss on the Barn Stage at the 2008 edition of Truck Festival. In response to requests over the years, Chapterhouse played live at Club AC30&#x27;s Reverence show at the ICA on 26 November 2009 along with Schnauss and Kirsty Hawkshaw. This was preceded on 23 November by a warm up show at the Luminaire in Kilburn. The band also played at The Scala in London on 18 March 2010, and undertook short tours of Japan in April 2010 and North America in May 2010. The North American tour had to be postponed due to the Icelandic ash cloud cancelling flights, stranding Patman in Japan. Chapterhouse rescheduled the North American tour for September and October 2010. No plans were made for any other shows and the band ended the brief reunion in 2010.

On 22 March 2023, the band announced a deluxe CD box set release entitled &quot;Chronology&quot;. It contains previously released albums, singles, b-sides, remixes, and demos, including twenty unreleased songs. It was released on 26 May 2023 through Cherry Red Records.

== Post-breakup ==
In 1997, Sherriff started working as a composer/sound designer for an Emmy Award-winning music production company Adelphoi Music. Patman and Bates joined him later in 2001. After more than twenty years, they departed from the company, pursuing their career as freelance composers. Bates also continues being a long-standing member of Tunng. 

In October 2022, Rowe announced that he would be releasing a solo album, entitled &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Thinking&quot;. The album was recorded with the help of all the Chapterhouse members, alongside Ian McCutcheon, Neil Halstead and Hamish Brown. The album was released on 2 March 2023 via Big Potato Records.

She began her singing career with the album &quot;Jadoo&quot; in 1985, and by the 1990s she had become known as the &#x27;Queen of Indipop&#x27;. Her best known songs were with producers Anu Malik and Biddu during the 1990s. Her best known song is &quot;Made in India&quot;.

==Career==
Chinai&#x27;s initial albums include &quot;Jaadoo&quot;, &quot;Babydoll&quot;, &quot;Aah... Alisha!&quot;, &quot;Madonna&quot;, &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, &quot;Alisha - Madonna of India&quot; and &quot;Made in India&quot;. Alisha was introduced to Hindi film music by the veteran music director and composer Bappi Lahiri. They had many disco hits together in many films in the 1980s including &quot;Adventures of Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Dance Dance&quot;, &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Guru&quot;, &quot;Love Love Love&quot;, etc. When she started her career with him, she was playback singing for many leading actresses, such as Karisma Kapoor, Smita Patil, Mandakini, Sridevi, Juhi Chawla, Madhuri Dixit, Divya Bharti. In 1985, Alisha sang two songs with Remo Fernandes, in Konkani, for the album &quot;Old Goan Gold&quot;. She also recorded a song for Pankuj Parashar&#x27;s film &quot;Jalwa&quot; (1987), composed by Anand–Milind. One of her biggest hits during the 1980s was &quot;Kaate Nahin Katthe&quot; (&quot;Mr. India&quot;), which she recorded in 1987 with Kishore Kumar under the music direction of Laxmikant–Pyarelal. Another successful track, in 1989, was &quot;Raat Bhar Jaam Se&quot; from the film &quot;Tridev&quot;, which had music by Kalyanji-Anandji and Viju Shah.

In the 1990s, Chinai took on working in different films, collaborating with other music directors, such as Anu Malik, Anand–Milind, Rajesh Roshan and Nadeem-Shravan. Throughout these years, she had several Bollywood hit songs, including &quot;Dhak Dhak Dhak&quot; with Aditya Pancholi (&quot;Maha-Sangram&quot;), &quot;Jalta Hai Badan&quot; (&quot;Balwaan&quot;), &quot;Tere Ishq Mein Nachenge&quot; (&quot;Raja Hindustani&quot;), &quot;Chaa Raha Hain Pyaar Ka Nasha&quot; (&quot;Chandra Mukhi&quot;), &quot;Roundhe&quot; (&quot;Pyar Tune Kya Kiya&quot;), &quot;Sona Sona Roop Hai&quot; (&quot;Bollywood/Hollywood&quot;), &quot;Mouje Mein&quot; (&quot;Karobaar&quot;), &quot;De Diya&quot; (&quot;Keemat&quot;), &quot;Ruk Ruk Ruk&quot; (&quot;Vijaypath&quot;) and the controversial &quot;Sexy Sexy Sexy Mujhe Log Bole&quot; (&quot;Khuddar&quot;).

Chinai recorded an album with Lesle Lewis under the title &quot;Bombay Girl&quot;, which included the hit song &quot;De De&quot; released in 1994.
Simultaneously, she recorded many songs as a pop singer, with accompanying album releases. Chinai was noted for her 1995 hit single and album, titled &quot;Made in India&quot;, which was composed by Biddu and went on to become one of the highest-selling pop albums of its time, making Alisha became a household name. It contains well-known songs such as &quot;Aaja Mere Dil Mein&quot;, &quot;Ek Baar Do Baar&quot;, &quot;Sun O Meri Dhadkan&quot;, &quot;Tu Kahan&quot;, &quot;Ooh La La&quot;, &quot;Tu Jo Mila&quot;, &quot;Dhokha Diya Hai Re Tune Mere Dil&quot; and &quot;Lover Girl&quot;. With its success, Chinai announced her departure from playback singing and wanted to concentrate only on private pop albums. However, her follow-up releases were less successful. This was also the period when she got into a major controversy with the man who recorded several hit songs with her, Anu Malik. During the release of &quot;Made in India&quot;, Chinai had accused Anu Malik of molesting her. Anu Malik and Chinai did not work for several years, only to reunite in 2003 with &quot;Ishq Vishk&quot;. 
Chinai&#x27;s comeback to film music was with the song &quot;Oh My Darling&quot; in the Yash Raj film &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot;. From 2000 to 2009, she recorded primarily with Himesh Reshammiya, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy and Pritam. After her controversy with Anu Malik in the 1990s, she patched up with him to record for a number of films, starting with &quot;Ishq Vishk&quot;, &quot;Fida&quot;, &quot;No Entry&quot;, &quot;Love Story 2050&quot;, &quot;Maan Gaye Mughle Azam&quot;, &quot;Ugly Aur Pagli&quot;, &quot;Chehraa&quot; and &quot;Kambakht Ishq&quot;.

In 2005, Chinai&#x27;s career reached a new high when she sang &quot;Kajra Re&quot; (&quot;Bunty Aur Babli&quot;). The song was a hit and won her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer. She was also a judge on &quot;Indian Idol 3&quot; and is a judge on Zee TV&#x27;s &quot;Star Ya Rockstar&quot; with Anu Malik.

<text>The Uncompahgre River is a tributary of the Gunnison River, approximately long, in southwestern Colorado in the United States. Lake Como at in northern San Juan County, in the Uncompahgre National Forest in the northwestern San Juan Mountains is the headwaters of the river. It flows northwest past Ouray, Ridgway, Montrose, and Olathe and joins the Gunnison at Confluence Park in Delta.

The river forms Poughkeepsie Gulch and the Uncompahgre Gorge. The major tributaries are all creeks draining the northwest San Juan Mountains.

There are two dams on the Uncompahgre River, a small diversion dam in the Uncompahgre Gorge, and Ridgway Dam below the town of Ridgway which forms Ridgway Reservoir.

The river is used for irrigation in the Uncompahgre Valley. Additionally, water from the Gunnison is diverted to the valley via the Gunnison Tunnel. The Uncompahgre is unnavigable except at high water.

The name &quot;Uncompahgre&quot; () comes from the Ute word &quot;Uncompaghre&quot;, which loosely translates to &quot;dirty water,&quot; &quot;red lake,&quot; or &quot;red water spring&quot; and is likely a reference to the many hot springs in the vicinity of Ouray.

== Conservation ==
In October 2020, the City of Montrose announced a multi-year, multi-million dollar river restoration project along the Uncompahgre, including $785,000 total grants from the Colorado Water Conservation Board. The project will enhance fishing habitats, provide bank stabilization, increase river access and fishing opportunities for the public. 

The public-private partnership includes Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife, Colorado Trout Unlimited, and fly fishing company Mayfly Outdoors.

<text>Lynn René Anderson (September 26, 1947 – July 30, 2015) was an American country singer and television personality. Her crossover signature recording, &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, was a number one hit internationally. She also charted five number one and 18 top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. Anderson is regarded as one of country music&#x27;s most significant performers.

Born in Grand Forks, North Dakota, United States, she was raised in California by her mother, Liz Anderson, who was also a country music artist. Daughter Lynn was signed to a recording contract to Chart Records in 1966 after she was heard singing along with her mother at an industry function. Previously she had recorded some demo tapes of her mother&#x27;s songs and appeared on television in California on regional country music shows. In 1967, she had her first top ten hit with the single &quot;If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away)&quot;. Soon after, Anderson joined the cast of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, where she performed country music weekly to a national audience.

In 1970, Anderson signed with Columbia Records, where she was produced by her first husband, Glenn Sutton. She had her biggest commercial success with &quot;Rose Garden&quot;. The song reached positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country, pop, and adult contemporary charts, also charting in the Top-5 in 15 other countries and earning her a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Throughout the decade, Anderson also had number-one hits with &quot;You&#x27;re My Man&quot;, &quot;How Can I Unlove You&quot;, &quot;Keep Me in Mind&quot;, and &quot;What a Man My Man Is&quot;. She also became a television personality, with appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, specials with Bob Hope and Dean Martin, and her own prime-time specials.

After a brief hiatus, Anderson returned with the studio album &quot;Back&quot; (1983). The album spawned three singles, including the top ten hit &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome to Tonight&quot;, with Gary Morris. She continued recording sporadically throughout the 1980s. This included a revival of the pop hit &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; and the studio album &quot;What She Does Best&quot; (1988). Anderson continued releasing new albums into the new millennium, such as 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Bluegrass Sessions&quot;. Towards the end of her life, Anderson struggled with alcohol addiction, but continued performing until her death in 2015. For her work as a crossover artist, she was ranked on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time&quot; and &quot;CMT&quot;s &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot;.

==Early life==
Lynn Rene Anderson was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota, on September 26, 1947, to Casey and Liz Anderson. Her grandparents were Scandinavian immigrants who established a North Dakota &quot;saddle club&quot;. According to Anderson, she could ride horses before she could walk. While she was still a young child, the family relocated to a subdivision in Fair Oaks, California. 

However, Anderson insisted that her parents move to a ranch, prompting the family to move to Sacramento, California. In Sacramento, the Anderson family bought a ranch with two acres of land. The family raised horses, which she learned how to ride and care for. At the age of 9, Anderson won second place at a local horse-racing event in San Francisco, California. Lynn also became interested in performing from an early age. Both her parents were aspiring songwriters that had formed friendships with west country performers. Her performing and musical interests continued into high school. During her teens she landed a job working as a secretary for KROY in Sacramento. Upon graduating, she became the station&#x27;s secretary to the general manager.

While working full-time, Lynn continued entering equestrian competitions. Once winning several competitions, she was dubbed the &quot;California Horse Show Queen&quot; in 1966. While watching her daughter at these events, Liz Anderson was also composing songs. She sent her compositions to Los Angeles and Nashville, Tennessee, where they were heard by music executives. Among the songs heard was &quot;(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers&quot;, which was recorded by Merle Haggard in 1964. The song led producer Chet Atkins to sign Liz to a recording contract at RCA Victor. This prompted the family to relocate to Nashville. Before officially moving, Liz took a brief trip with her daughter to Nashville in 1965. At a hotel, mother and daughter performed in an informal sing-along with several other artists. Also present at the sing-along was producer Slim Williamson. Impressed by her vocals, Williamson offered Lynn a recording contract of her own. In 1966, she signed her first recording contract with Chart Records.

==Music career==
===1966–1969: Early country success and &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;===
During a car ride, Liz Anderson composed a song titled &quot;Ride, Ride, Ride&quot;. Her daughter liked the song and had an interest in cutting it at her new label. It was cut at her first recording session. Although her debut single was 1966&#x27;s &quot;In Person&quot;, it was &quot;Ride, Ride, Ride&quot; that became Anderson&#x27;s first charting single. Her next release was another Liz Anderson composition, &quot;If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away)&quot;. It was Anderson&#x27;s first major hit as a music artist, reaching number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart in 1967. Her debut studio album of the same name was also released in 1967 and peaked at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. She followed it with &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, which reached number four on the country singles list in February 1968. Her second studio release of the same name reached number one on the country albums chart. 
When reviewing her 1999 Chart compilation, Greg Adams of AllMusic gave the recording four-and-a-half out of five stars. &quot;Lynn Anderson made some of the best music of her career during her late-&#x27;60s period on the Chart label&quot;, Adams commented. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine also praised these early recordings. In reviewing &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, writers took note of her mass appeal. &quot;The material which includes her fine renditions of &#x27;Honey&#x27; and &#x27;Ring of Fire&#x27; is diversified and has appeal for all buyers&quot;, they wrote.

In 1967, Anderson&#x27;s career gained further momentum when she was cast on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;. Welk&#x27;s son, Larry Welk, discovered an Anderson album cover and was drawn to her physicality. Larry&#x27;s interest drew Lawrence Welk to audition and eventually cast her. Anderson became the show&#x27;s first country performer and toured with the cast nationwide. However, she was dissatisfied with the material chosen for her to sing on the program and threatened to quit. After meeting with Welk, different arrangements were made for Anderson&#x27;s performances. The exposure led to continued music success. In 1967, she won the &quot;Top Female Vocalist&quot; award at the Academy of Country Music Awards. She remained with &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; until 1968.

While finding chart success and common ground with Welk, Anderson was not finding common ground with the Nashville establishment. &quot;I was seen as a kid from California on the Welk show – not a real country artist&quot;, she stated. Thus, she chose to record more traditional material that would help associate her with Nashville&#x27;s country music scene. Among these songs was a cover of the Osborne Brothers&#x27; &quot;Rocky Top&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s version became a bigger hit than the original, climbing to number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles list in 1970. She had country hits between 1968 and 1969 that further displayed a traditional country style, including &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s a No No&quot; and a cover of Hank Snow&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s sixth studio album was a tribute to the traditional female country performers that preceded her. Entitled &quot;Songs That Made Country Girls Famous&quot; (1969), the album reached number nine on the country albums chart.

===1970–1980: Rose Garden and breakthrough===

In 1970, Anderson&#x27;s recording contract was bought by Columbia Records and she began recording for the new label that year. Two years prior, she married songwriter and producer Glenn Sutton, who ultimately became her producer at the label. Her first Columbia release was the Sutton-penned &quot;Stay There, Till I Get There&quot;. The song became her fifth top ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart, rising to number seven in 1970. Her eighth studio album of the same name was also released in 1970. According to writer Greg Adams, the album resembled the traditional country of her previous Chart recordings. Despite the success of Sutton&#x27;s composition, Anderson claimed that it was hard for Sutton to provide additional material for her. His collaborator, Billy Sherrill, oversaw Sutton and chose many of his compositions for Tammy Wynette to record. &quot;Glenn was very politically connected at Columbia and Epic...so I had to find songs from other sources, which is why a lot of my songs were written by other people&quot;, she commented in 2011.
According to Anderson, she had found the original version of &quot;Rose Garden&quot; on &quot;a Joe South album and loved it.&quot; She then brought it to the attention of Glenn Sutton. However, Sutton was against recording it because lines in the song were sung from a male perspective. However, he eventually acceded to Anderson after she kept bringing the song into recording sessions. Released as a single in October 1970, the song became Anderson&#x27;s first number one single, topping the charts for five weeks. It was also her first to crossover onto the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number three in February 1971. The song was an international hit, reaching the Top-5 in 15 other countries. Its crossover success helped Anderson receive accolades from 13th Annual Grammy Awards, the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association. Anderson&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, was released in December 1970. The record topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and spent 77 weeks on the survey altogether. It was also her highest-peaking album on the Billboard 200 chart list, reaching number 19. The record certified platinum in sales from the Recording Industry Association of America.

Anderson followed &quot;Rose Garden&quot; with the singles &quot;You&#x27;re My Man&quot; and &quot;How Can I Unlove You&quot;, which both became number one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart in 1971. Both songs also registered on the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart, with &quot;You&#x27;re My Man&quot; becoming a top ten hit on that survey. The latter singles appeared on corresponding studio releases. This begun with &quot;You&#x27;re My Man&quot;, which reached the top spot on the country albums list. The project also peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, praising the album&#x27;s pop covers of &quot;Knock Three Times&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. Her twelfth studio album was also titled &quot;How Can I Unlove You.&quot; It featured covers of &quot;Take Me Home Country Roads&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;. The record peaked at number two on the country albums chart and number 132 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;.

She continued to diversify her music by recording songs of different styles. In 1972, Anderson recorded Johnnie Ray&#x27;s pop hit &quot;Cry&quot;, which became a top five country hit for Anderson. She also reached the top five with a version of Loggins and Messina&#x27;s &quot;Listen to a Country Song&quot; and Joe South&#x27;s &quot;Fool Me&quot;. She then covered The Carpenters&#x27; &quot;Top of the World&quot; after hearing it on their 1972 album, &quot;A Song for You&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s version reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. After discovering that Anderson&#x27;s version had become a hit, The Carpenters released their own version for the pop market.

In the 21st century, critics have taken notice of Anderson&#x27;s various music styles. Writers Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann commented that her diverse song subjects proved that she could be &quot;poignant&quot; and &quot;downhearted&quot;. Greg Adams of Allmusic thought that albums such as 1972&#x27;s &quot;Cry&quot; had an easy listening style that made her music more marketable to different genres.
Between 1973 and 1974, the singles &quot;Keep Me in Mind&quot; and &quot;What a Man My Man Is&quot; reached number one. Anderson&#x27;s success was also fueled by television appearances, especially during the second half of the decade. She appeared on prime-time shows &quot;The Brady Bunch Hour&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. Additionally, she collaborated with Dean Martin and Bob Hope on television and in concert. Anderson hosted her own CBS television special in 1977. Regular television appearances helped promote singles that were less successful. This included a one-episode appearance on &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, where Anderson performed her 1977 single &quot;Wrap Your Love All Around Your Man&quot;. After her performance, the song reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles chart. She had further top twenty country hits in the middle decade with &quot;He Turns It into Love Again&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Loved Anyone More&quot;, and &quot;All the King&#x27;s Horses&quot;. With declining chart success, Anderson adopted a newer image which was described by writers as &quot;racy&quot; and &quot;skin tight&quot;. The new style proved successful when she returned in 1979 with Karla Bonoff&#x27;s &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Always Love&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s version reached the top ten of the country charts. Its success led to her 1979 album reaching the top 30 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. In 1980, Anderson released her last studio album for Columbia Records called &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. It produced two top 30 country singles, including the title track, which reached number 26.

===1982–1989: Hiatus and comeback===
In 1980, Anderson left Columbia Records after remarrying two years prior. Prior to her departure, it was claimed that Columbia intended to promote her as the company&#x27;s answer to counterparts, Barbara Mandrell and Dolly Parton. Instead, Anderson moved to Louisiana with her second husband and raised a family. With the exception of an album of re-recordings, she did not record for nearly three years. In 1982, Anderson and Harold Stream divorced. She returned to Nashville that same year and began working with former CBS agent Bonnie Garner. In 1983, Garner helped her secure a new recording contract with the independent label Permian Records.

In 1983, she released her 29th studio album, &quot;Back&quot;, on Permian. Writers Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann called the album&#x27;s music &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;bruised&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s what I felt at the time&quot;, Anderson recalled of the album&#x27;s choice of material. &quot;Back&quot; was her last charting record, peaking at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums list in 1983. Two singles were spawned that became major hits. The first was &quot;What I Learned from Loving You&quot;, a top twenty hit on the Hot Country Songs chart. The second was a duet with Gary Morris called &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome to Tonight&quot;. It was Anderson&#x27;s first top ten hit in five years, reaching number nine in 1984.

In 1986, Permian Records filed for bankruptcy. Although the label focused on artist management and production, it dropped all of its major artists, including Anderson. During this period Anderson did not release full-length albums, but did record a single for MCA Records. Titled &quot;Heart of the Matter,&quot; the track did not chart. She then signed with Mercury Records in the second half of the decade. In 1988, her cover of The Drifters&#x27; &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; became her highest-charting single in five years, peaking at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. Her 30th studio album, &quot;What She Does Best&quot;, was issued on Mercury in 1988. The record&#x27;s title track was also spawned as a single and became a minor hit in 1988. The album&#x27;s third (and final) single, &quot;How Many Hearts&quot;, was Anderson&#x27;s last chart appearance in her career. In March 1989, it peaked at number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart.

===1990–2015: New musical directions===
Anderson left the major label market following her departure from Mercury in 1990. She began to diversify her career during this time. In 1990, she appeared on the BBC Scotland drama &quot;The Wreck on the Highway&quot;. She also recorded a variety of different musical genres. In 1992, she released the studio album &quot;Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; on the independent Laserlight label. The project was western-themed and included collaborations with Emmylou Harris and Marty Stuart. Allmusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars, yet called it one of her &quot;stronger albums&quot;. In 1992, &quot;Billboard&quot; gave the album a positive response. &quot;Anderson has never sounded better or more alluring than she does in this collection built around a western/living free motif&quot;, staff writers noted. Six years later, Anderson released the Platinum Entertainment studio project, &quot;Latest and Greatest&quot;. The album included re-recordings of her hits, and also featured three new tracks. Two of the album&#x27;s track were composed by Anderson&#x27;s partner, Mentor Williams. In their review, Allmusic commented that she no longer had her &quot;girlish&quot; edge, but rather a voice comparable to that of K.T. Oslin or Mary Chapin Carpenter.
In 2000, Anderson released her first live record entitled &quot;Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;, which was issued on the Smith label. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic gave the effort three out of five stars in his review, commenting, &quot;This disc is not an electrifying find, but it&#x27;s decent for what it is.&quot; In June 2005, Anderson&#x27;s 34th studio album, &quot;The Bluegrass Sessions&quot; was issued on the DM label. The album was a collection of Anderson&#x27;s former hits recorded in a bluegrass style. The track listing included hits such as &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My Man&quot;, and &quot;Rocky Top&quot;. Zac Johnson of Allmusic gave the release 2.5 out of 5 possible stars. Johnson questioned her authenticity when reviewing the record, noting that some songs sounded &quot;a little forced&quot;. Despite the critical response, &quot;The Bluegrass Sessions&quot; was nominated by the Grammy Awards for Best Bluegrass Album.

Over the next several years, Anderson continued touring and performing as well. In 2007, Anderson was part of the lineup at the CMA Music Festival at the Riverfront Park. Other performers included Terri Clark and Lorrie Morgan. In 2009, she performed at the Stagecoach Festival, which also included several additional performers as well. Between 2010 and 2011, she performed alongside the Metropole Symphony Orchestra for a series of concerts. Anderson also continued recording music. In 2006, she released her 35th studio album, &quot;Cowgirl&quot;. The album was a collection of western songs, which were written (or co-written) with her mother. The project was released on her mother&#x27;s label, Showboat Records. A similar project was issued in 2010 entitled &quot;Cowgirl II&quot; on the same label. According to Anderson, her reasons for releasing both western albums was to present the genre in a &quot;sophisticated way&quot; for people who did not know the music.

In June 2015, Anderson released her final studio album &quot;Bridges&quot;. The album was a collection of gospel material that included collaborations with The Martins and The Oak Ridge Boys. According to a 2015 interview with Anderson, it was her first album in ten years that she decided to promote. It was also Anderson&#x27;s first gospel collection and featured a reworking of Dobie Gray&#x27;s &quot;Drift Away&quot; for the Christian market. Writer Timothy Yap called the album&#x27;s songwriting &quot;top notch&quot; in his review of the album. Markos Papadatos of the &quot;Digital Journal&quot; gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling the record &quot;phenomenal&quot;. The album was released a month prior to her death in July 2015.

==Equestrian career==
In addition to her music career, Anderson was also an equestrian and professional horse racer. While she had equestrian credits before signing her first recording contract, Anderson continued pursuing it throughout her life. Over the course of her life, Anderson had won 16 national championships, eight world championships and some celebrity championships. 
She often alternated between performing music concerts and participating in horse shows. &quot;I&#x27;d go sing at a concert, then fly to a horse show, then fly back the next night for a concert. I was real serious about showing horses&quot;, she recounted. Anderson also bred horses, most notably quarter horses. Among her bred horses, Doc Starlight, helped start a bloodline for cutting horses in the United States. She was a lifelong member of the American Quarter Horse Association and participated in a variety of the organization&#x27;s events. While she participated in many events, the cutting horse events were considered her favorites.

Anderson kept show horses in Texas during the final years of her life. She also employed a horse trainer to keep the animals active and ready for competitions. Anderson traveled between Texas and her home in New Mexico to spend time with the horses. She also raised horses at her ranch in New Mexico. In a 1995 interview, Anderson told reporter Gene Stout that she mainly moved to New Mexico so that she could raise horses. &quot;I’ve been kind of a cowgirl most of my life, so New Mexico is the perfect place for me. It suits me very well. Ninety percent of the time I’m in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat&quot;, she recounted.

Anderson worked with disabled children and facilitated in learning to ride horses. She helped establish a horse riding organization in Franklin, Tennessee called &quot;Special Riders&quot;. Anderson was inspired to establish the organization after observing a child who had crutches and was unable to ride. Anderson also collaborated with a similar program in Texas called &quot;Rocky Top Riders&quot;. Although not started by Anderson, the program was named for her 1970 country hit. She also established a clinic to help aspiring young female riders. Entitled &quot;Rodeo Queen&quot;, the clinic focused on horse show activities, such as horse grooming and self-care. She also worked with the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (NARHA) for several years.

==Personal life==
===Marriages, relationships and family===
Anderson was married twice and had three children. Her first marriage to Glenn Sutton lasted from 1968 until 1977. The pair met after Sutton developed an interest in producing her music while at the Chart label. Anderson stated that she had turned down several professional opportunities due to Sutton&#x27;s disapproval. This included touring in Vietnam with Bob Hope and acting in the film &quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot;. The pair continued collaborating musically until they divorced in 1977. The couple had one child together, Lisa Sutton.

In 1978, Anderson married Texas business entrepreneur Harold &quot;Spook&quot; Stream. She had met Stream at a rodeo event and developed a romantic relationship shortly afterward. The couple had two children together. The couple divorced in 1982. Anderson claimed that Stream had been physically abusive, stating that he had attempted to run her over with a vehicle and attempted to hit her. Following their divorce, Anderson and Stream fought over custody of their two children. Although attempting to gain visitation rights, Anderson ultimately lost custody of the children.

Anderson reconnected with songwriter Mentor Williams following her divorce. The pair reunited at a Nashville press event and the relationship turned romantic in 1989. The couple later moved to a ranch in Taos, New Mexico, the home state of Williams. Anderson and Williams lived in New Mexico until her death in 2015. The pair never married but remained in a committed relationship. &quot;He’s technically my boyfriend, but really he’s like my husband&quot;, Anderson said in 2013.

===Legal issues===

Anderson had issues with alcohol towards the end of her life. In December 2004, she was arrested and charged with driving under the influence in Denton, Texas. A driver following Anderson called the police after noticing her car weaving in and out of lanes. After failing a field sobriety test, she was arrested and released on a $1000 bond. On January 24, 2005, Anderson was accused of shoplifting a &quot;Harry Potter&quot; DVD from a local supermarket in Taos, New Mexico. Upon her arrest she punched the arresting officer. She was charged with shoplifting, resisting arrest and assault on a police officer. The assault charges were later dropped. The shoplifting charge was dropped, as long as Anderson agreed to not commit any further offenses.

In May 2006, Anderson was arrested on a second DUI charge after a traffic accident near Española, New Mexico. According to police, Anderson failed a sobriety test and refused to take a breathalyzer test after her car hit the back of another car. No one was injured in the collision and she again was charged and released on bond. Her last arrest occurred on September 11, 2014, after being involved in a minor traffic accident in Nashville, Tennessee, on West End Avenue. Anderson was arrested after she admitted to drinking alcohol and taking prescription medication. She was booked on DUI and released on a $5,000 bond. She issued a statement and apologized to her fans. Anderson later went through rehabilitation at the Betty Ford Center.

===Death===
Anderson died on July 30, 2015, at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 67. She had been briefly hospitalized due to pneumonia after vacationing in Italy. The official cause of death was a heart attack. At her funeral, friend Brenda Lee gave a speech, and several doves were released to commemorate her passing. 

Anderson is interred in the mausoleum at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Nashville near her mother, Liz, who died in 2011. Her father, Clarence, died in 2018 and was interred next to his wife. That same year, Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery (referred to as &quot;Cemetery of Country Stars&quot;) created &quot;The Lynn Anderson Rose Garden&quot;, consisting of 200 Lynn Anderson Hybrid Rose Bushes (named for the singer by the National Rose Society of America), as a place of reflection and meditation, in honor of Anderson&#x27;s signature song.

==Musical styles==

Anderson&#x27;s music is rooted in the country genre. It is also rooted in the sub-genres of the Nashville Sound, Countrypolitan, bluegrass, western and gospel. Early on, Anderson had a traditional country style that featured instruments such as the steel guitar and the banjo. These recordings also incorporated some elements of the Nashville Sound style. Her style shifted after working alongside Glenn Sutton, who helped develop Anderson&#x27;s music towards the Countrypolitan format by combining soft rock and adult contemporary. This was first seen on her 1970 studio album, &quot;No Love at All&quot;. Reviewer Pemberton Roach said the album exemplified the style through its emotional lyrics and mature vocal stylings. It was most apparent in &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, which writer Richard Carlin called a &quot;poppy, upbeat song&quot; with rock accompaniment.

As Anderson&#x27;s music routinely crossed over into the pop field, it developed into adult contemporary and pop music. Anderson recorded covers of pop hits for her studio releases during the 1970s. In his review of her 1972 album, Greg Adams commented on her shift: &quot;&quot;Cry&quot; continues Lynn Anderson&#x27;s trend toward pop music and away from songs written by her gifted mother, Liz Anderson.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted a similar trend in his review of her 2017 album, &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot;: &quot;[It] winds up with a narrative, illustrating how Anderson drifted from the Nashville sound to easy listening by the end of the &#x27;70s, and by telling that story, this double disc lives up to its title&#x27;s promise&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s singing voice has also been highlighted by writers and journalists. David Laing of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her as having a &quot;powerful alto voice.&quot; Steve Huey of Allmusic called Anderson&#x27;s voice &quot;sweet but strong&quot; in his biography of her career.

==Legacy, honours and achievements==
Anderson has been widely regarded as one of country music&#x27;s most significant female artists. According to Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann, Anderson brought female artists to a new level in the 1970s. Steve Huey of Allmusic called her &quot;one of the most popular female country singers of the early &#x27;70s&quot;. Courtney Campbell of &quot;Wide Open Country&quot; called her &quot;one of the most important female country music voices of her time&quot;. At the time of her passing, other country artists acknowledged her as a career inspiration, most notably Neal McCoy, Martina McBride and Mary Sarah. Reba McEntire also saw Anderson as a musical inspiration: &quot;I am a huge fan of Lynn’s. She was always so nice to me. She did so much for the females in country music. Always continuing to pave the road for those to follow.&quot;

Writers and music journalists have most notably regarded Anderson as an important crossover music artist. In his book &quot;Historical Dictionary of Popular Music&quot;, author Norman Abjorensen viewed her as an artist that &quot;took aim at the mainstream pop audience&quot;. Bufwack and Oermann noted that Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Rose Garden&quot; helped set the trend for female crossover artists in the 1970s. Her crossover legacy has also been recognized for her national television appearances. In 2015, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; explained that Anderson was the first female country artist to appear on national television due to cast membership on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;. Courtney Campbell of &quot;Wide Open Country&quot; noted that she was the first female country performer to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and headline at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Anderson has also been given honors and achievements as part of her legacy. Record World named her their &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot; between 1970 and 1980. In the mid-1990s, a hybrid tea rose was created called &quot;The Lynn Anderson Rose&quot;. In 1999, Governor Don Sundquist of Tennessee made June 15 &quot;Lynn Anderson Day&quot; in the state. She was also inducted into the North American Country Music Association Hall of Fame the same year.

In 2002, she was ranked by Country Music Television on their list of the &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot;. She received a similar recognition when &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included her on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time&quot;. In 2017, her stage costumes and memorabilia were on display at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. The Anderson exhibit was called &quot;Keep Me in Mind&quot;. The exhibit ran through 2018. In 2018, daughter Lisa Sutton helped open the Lynn Anderson Rose Garden in Nashville to pay tribute to her career. In 2019, she was inducted into the Western Music Association Hall of Fame. In 2020, Anderson was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;Iconic Women of Country&quot;. Female country artists, including Trisha Yearwood, discussed her legacy in the genre. The same year, Anderson&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, was remastered for its 50th anniversary. The new edition included liner notes from Clive Davis and Reba McEntire.

<text>was a 120-metre-tall giant Ferris wheel in the city of Fukuoka, Japan, operating from December 2001 until September 2009.
It was tall, making it the tallest Ferris wheel in Japan during its years of operation. It was located in the Evergreen Marinoa (Japanese: エバーグリーンマリノア) entertainment facility adjacent to the Marinoa City Fukuoka mall, which itself features a smaller, 58-metre-tall ferris wheel.

The gondolas were all air conditioned and accessible for wheelchair-users. One full rotation took approximately 20 minutes.

Sky Dream Fukuoka was built to renew the infrastructure in Fukuoka with an attempt to develop the cultural tourism industry in the city. Promoting Sky Dream Fukuoka as one of the tallest Ferris wheels in Japan, Fukuoka sought to gain profound growth in its regional economy through revenue generated from tourism. When the Ferris wheel was newly opened for visitors, Sky Dream Fukuoka achieved a fair amount of popularity as a landmark and tourist attraction.

Sky Dream Fukuoka eventually faced financial challenges soon after, where visitors have declined over time. The Sky Dream Fukuoka initially gained popularity over their slow pacing of the wheel rotation, where Sky Dream Fukuoka advertised the slow pacing of the Ferris wheel as a selling point that provides a longer amount of time for visitors to observe the landscape and spend time with their loved ones inside the capsule. However, the following selling feature didn’t appeal to their customers as more Ferris wheels from Western countries adopted more thrilling &amp; fast-paced Ferris wheels that have risen in popularity. Moreover, because the Ferris wheel was big, it required expensive maintenance work to keep the Sky Dream Fukuoka in operation. But as the passenger numbers of Sky Dream Fukuoka were declining over time, generating enough revenue to fulfill the maintenance cost &amp; profit was predicted to be unviable. Therefore, the Evergreen Group (owner of the Sky Dream Fukuoka) has decided to close the Sky Dream Fukuoka permanently.

Sky Dream Fukuoka closed on 26 September 2009. It was subsequently sold to a Taiwanese company for rebuilding at Lihpao Land in Taiwan. Dismantling work commenced in 2010, although work was disrupted in July 2011 when supports failed, causing two cranes involved in dismantling to topple over, injuring one workman and damaging four cars.

<text>United New Zealand () was a centrist political party in New Zealand founded in 1995. It merged with the Christian-based Future New Zealand party to form the United Future New Zealand party in 2000.

==History==
===Formation===
United was founded on 28 June 1995, one of a number of new parties hoping to capitalise on the upcoming switch to the MMP electoral system. It was intended to be a liberal centrist party, encompassing moderate voters from both the centre-left and the centre-right. The party was established by four MPs from the National Party, two MPs from the Labour Party, and former Labour MP Peter Dunne, who had already established his own party, Future New Zealand (not to be confused with the Christian-based party of the same name which United later merged with). The party was led by Clive Matthewson, a former Labour MP.
The MPs who established United were:
===1996 election===
The party, while initially attracting interest, performed poorly in the 1996 election. The party&#x27;s policies were centrist and liberal in nature but to many appeared too bland to attract media profile. In addition, Matthewson, while charismatic, was seen by many as an intellectual light-weight. Bruce Cliffe had indicated he would resign from Parliament in 1996. Peter Dunne was the only United MP to retain his seat, with all others being ejected from Parliament. Clive Matthewson, whose seat had been abolished in the change to MMP, placed fourth in his new electorate.

As the party&#x27;s only surviving MP, Peter Dunne became leader of United. When United entered into a coalition with the governing National Party in 1996, securing a Cabinet post for Peter Dunne, many commentators claimed that the party had abandoned its centrist stance. United claimed that a deal with National would allow United to moderate National&#x27;s more extreme right-wing tendencies and that such arrangements would become common practice under the new MMP system.

1997 saw the merging into United of the Advance NZ Party, Ethnic Minority Party and the Conservatives; all small centre-right parties established to contest the 1996 election.

===1999 election===
In the 1999 election, United&#x27;s share of the vote declined even further, with swinging voters shifting to Labour to oust the Shipley government. However, Peter Dunne managed to retain his electorate seat thereby preserving United&#x27;s parliamentary representation.

===Later developments===
United merged with a social conservative, evangelical Christian-based party Future New Zealand (not to be confused with Peter Dunne&#x27;s party before United was formed) in 2000. Future New Zealand, formerly the Christian Democrats, was not represented in parliament. The merged party adopted the name United Future New Zealand, and established a caucus that has extended from seven (47th New Zealand Parliament, 2002–2005) to three (48th New Zealand Parliament, 2005–2007) to two members (48th New Zealand Parliament, May 2007 – 2008) with the departure of Gordon Copeland, eventually returning to just one MP elected in , and . Of these caucuses, Dunne remained the only electorate MP, while his caucus was formed from United Future&#x27;s MMP party list, and consisted of MPs who were progressive on social justice issues but conservative on some moral issues.

<text>Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders (also known as Raiders) were an American rock band formed in Boise, Idaho, in 1958. They saw considerable U.S. mainstream success in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s. The band was known for including Revolutionary War-style clothes in their attire.

Originally an instrumental rock combo called the Downbeats, the Raiders were formed in 1958 by organist Paul Revere, and included singer Mark Lindsay. After charting in 1961 with the minor hit &quot;Like, Long Hair&quot; and then in late 1963 just missing &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 with a cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, the band was signed to Columbia Records, under the tutelage of producer Terry Melcher. In January 1966 the single &quot;Just Like Me&quot;—propelled by exposure on Dick Clark&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Where The Action Is&quot;—reached no. 11 on the Hot 100, followed by the consecutive Top Tens &quot;Kicks&quot; and &quot;Hungry&quot;, thus establishing the band as national stars. Clark&#x27;s TV shows showcased Lindsay as a teen idol and Revere as the &quot;madman&quot; of the group, and between 1966 and &#x27;69 they reached the top 30 with 12 hits. Bolstered by the success of the singles, the three 1966 albums &quot;Just Like Us&quot;, &quot;Midnight Ride&quot; and &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;67&quot; all were gold-certified by the RIAA.

Mark Lindsay replaced Terry Melcher as the Raiders&#x27; producer, and the band scored with the US No. 20 hit &quot;Let Me!&quot; in 1969. In early 1970 the band&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Raiders&quot; and one year later the hugely successful cover of the song &quot;Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)&quot; reached number one in both the US and Canada and was eventually certified platinum in 1996. But the failure to continue the record&#x27;s success led to the breakup of the band after being dropped by Columbia in 1975. In 1978, Revere went back to live performances with a show that mixed comedy and rock and roll. He died of cancer in 2014.

The group had many lineup changes, with their most well-known &quot;classic&quot; lineup being: Mark Lindsay (vocals and saxophone), Paul Revere (keyboards), Drake &quot;Kid&quot; Levin (guitar), Phil &quot;Fang&quot; Volk (bass), and Mike &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith (drums). This lineup recorded most of the material on the group&#x27;s first five Columbia albums from 1965 to 1967.

==History==

===Early years===
Initially based in Boise, Idaho, the Raiders began as an instrumental rock band led by organist and founder Paul Revere (1938–2014). The band relocated to Portland, Oregon, when Revere returned from serving in the armed forces in 1962.

In his early 20s, Revere owned several restaurants in Caldwell, Idaho, and first met singer Mark Lindsay (b. 1942) while picking up buns from the bakery where Lindsay worked. The circumstance of their meeting was later referred to in the tongue-in-cheek song &quot;Legend of Paul Revere&quot;, recorded by the group. Lindsay joined Revere&#x27;s band in 1958. Originally called the Downbeats, they changed their name to Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders in 1960 on the eve of their first record release for Gardena Records. The band garnered their first hit in the Pacific Northwest in 1961, with the instrumental &quot;Like, Long Hair&quot;. The record had enough national appeal that it peaked at no. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on April 17, 1961. When Revere was drafted for military service, he became a conscientious objector and worked as a cook at a mental institution for a year and a half of deferred service. During the same time period, Lindsay pumped gas in Wilsonville, Oregon. On the strength of their Top 40 single, Lindsay toured the U.S. in the summer of 1961 with a band that featured Leon Russell taking Revere&#x27;s place on piano.

By summer 1962, Revere and Lindsay were working together again in Oregon with a version of the Raiders that featured Mike &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith (1942–2001), a drummer who would spend two extended periods with the band. Around this time, KISN DJ Roger Hart, who was producing teen dances, was looking for a band to hire. Hart had a casual conversation with a bank teller who told him about a band called &quot;Paul Revere-something&quot;. Hart obtained Revere&#x27;s phone number and they met for lunch. Hart hired the band for one of his teen dances. Soon afterward, Hart became the group&#x27;s personal manager. It was Hart who suggested they record &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, for which Hart paid them about $50, producing the song and placing it on his Sandē label, ultimately attracting the attention of Columbia Records. According to Lindsay, the Raiders were a &quot;bunch of white-bread kids doing their best to sound black. We got signed to Columbia on the strength of sounding like this.&quot; Both the Kingsmen and the Raiders recorded &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in the same studio Northwestern Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings, Inc. (NWI) in Portland, Oregon, in April 1963. Sources concur that the Kingsmen session was first but vary on the date of the Raiders recording. Soon after, the Raiders added guitarist Drake Levin (replacing Charlie Coe, who had replaced “Louie Louie” soloist Steve West) and bassist Mike &quot;Doc&quot; Holiday (replacing Dick Walker and replaced in early 1965 by Phil Volk).

===Hits and promotion in the &quot;Action&quot; era===

In 1965, the Raiders began recording a string of garage rock classics. Under the guidance of producer Terry Melcher, the group relocated to Los Angeles and increasingly emulated the sounds of British Invasion bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals, while adding an American, R&amp;B feel. Their first major national hit, &quot;Just Like Me&quot;, was one of the first rock records to feature a distinctive, double-tracked guitar solo, performed by guitarist Drake Levin. A late 1965 release, the single peaked at No. 11 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in January 1966 during a then-lengthy 15-week run.

Their Hot 100 hits from this period include &quot;Kicks&quot; (No. 4), &quot;Hungry&quot; (No. 6), &quot;The Great Airplane Strike&quot; (No. 20), &quot;Good Thing&quot; (No. 4) and &quot;Him or Me – What&#x27;s It Gonna Be?&quot; (No. 5). Of these, &quot;Kicks&quot; emerged as their best-known hit – a hip-sounding record with an anti-drug message, written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil and originally earmarked for the Animals. (Mann later revealed in interviews that the song was written about their friend, fellow 1960s songwriter Gerry Goffin, whose ongoing drug problems were interfering with his career and his relationship with then wife Carole King.)

The band appeared regularly in the U.S. on national television, most notably on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;, &quot;Happening &#x27;68&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Happening&quot;, the latter two co-hosted by Revere and Lindsay. In November 1966, the band appeared as themselves performing a song on the popular &quot;Batman&quot; television series in the episode &quot;Hizzonner the Penguin&quot;.

The Raiders had an endorsement deal with the Vox Amplifier Company through its U.S. distributor, the Thomas Organ Company, with Revere using the Vox Continental combo organ and Volk occasionally playing the Vox Phantom IV bass. When performing, the entire band was plugged into Vox Super Beatle amplifiers. The band was reported to be the first major band in history to tour with all members amplified, including sidemen such as horn players. When Levin left the group in 1966 to join the National Guard he was replaced by Jim Valley, another Northwest musician the Raiders had met during their days playing the Portland and Seattle music circuits. Valley was dubbed &quot;Harpo&quot; by the other Raiders due to a vague resemblance to the famous Marx brother.

By mid-1967, having released five albums in just over two years, the Raiders were Columbia&#x27;s top-selling rock group. Their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album released that spring was one of two releases selected by Clive Davis to test a higher list price for albums expected to be particularly popular (along with &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;).

===Major lineup change===
At the height of the group&#x27;s popularity, Valley, Volk, and Smith left the band. The split happened for a number of reasons, among them being the feeling that the group was prevented from evolving into a more egalitarian creative team, upset at being replaced by studio musicians on recordings (Volk denied this and said that the Wrecking Crew were hired by Melcher and Lindsay only to augment the band) and unhappy with a continued teen-oriented direction while a more serious rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll style was emerging.

Valley was the first to leave. Levin completed his National Guard service and rejoined the band during its spring 1967 tour. In April, Levin, Volk, and Smith flew to New York together when the Raiders were booked to perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Revere was upset about Valley, Volk, and Smith leaving the group, blaming Levin for their departures. Levin showed up at the Ed Sullivan Theater to perform with Volk and Smith for the very last time, but Revere refused to let him play. Unbeknownst to the group, Revere had hired a new guitar player, Freddy Weller, to perform that night. Levin held no grudges about this; he showed Weller the chords to the songs and watched from the wings as the Raiders made their one and only appearance on Sullivan&#x27;s show on April 30, 1967. It was the only time that the lineup of Revere, Lindsay, Smith, Volk, and Weller performed together. The following month, Volk and Smith left, subsequently rejoining Levin to form the band Brotherhood which would release two albums on RCA Records. Charlie Coe, who had played guitar for the group in 1963, rejoined the band on bass, and Joe Correro Jr. was recruited as the new drummer.

===The &quot;Happening&quot; era===
By 1968, changing musical tastes rendered the group and its matching revolutionary war costumes unfashionable, but they still continued to have modest hits through the rest of the decade, including &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;I Had a Dream&quot;, &quot;Too Much Talk&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Take It So Hard&quot;, &quot;Cinderella Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Mr. Sun, Mr. Moon&quot;, and &quot;Let Me!&quot;, which became their first gold record. On January 6, 1968, just four months after the cancellation of &quot;Where The Action Is&quot;, Revere and Lindsay returned to the air as hosts of a new Dick Clark-produced show in which the Raiders made several appearances, &quot;Happening &#x27;68&quot; (later shortened to &quot;Happening&quot;). This weekly series was joined from July to September that year by a Clark-produced daily series &quot;It&#x27;s Happening&quot;, also hosted by Revere and Lindsay. In August 1968, bassist Coe left the group again to get married and was replaced by former &quot;Action&quot; heartthrob Keith Allison. According to author Derek Taylor, the Raiders were seen as &quot;irrelevances. . . . Nervous citizens felt reassured that some good safe things never changed&quot;.

Terry Melcher ended his association with the group to focus on other artists and Mark Lindsay produced and arranged all records beginning with the psychedelic album &quot;Something Happening&quot;. The band moved further away from its garage rock roots and adopted a more layered, complex sound on &quot;Something Happening&quot; and the follow-up albums &quot;Hard &#x27;N&#x27; Heavy (with Marshmallow)&quot; and &quot;Alias Pink Puzz&quot;. (According to allmusic.com, Pink Puzz was the identity under which the Raiders first tried to get the album played on FM radio, a gambit that failed though the band kept the joke name for the album title.).

The success of &quot;Let Me!&quot; allowed Paul Revere and the Raiders to tour Europe with the Beach Boys in the summer of 1969 (they also recorded two songs for the long running German music program &quot;Beat-Club&quot;). The band also performed a specially written song and appeared in a television commercial for Pontiac&#x27;s new GTO-branded muscle car, &quot;The Judge&quot;. The group was also invited to appear at the Woodstock festival but reportedly turned down the invitation. Later in 1969, &quot;Happening&quot; ended its run on television and Lindsay released a hit single as a solo artist, &quot;Arizona&quot;, written by Kenny Young, which peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

===The Raiders: early 1970s===
In an effort to change the band&#x27;s sound and image, its name was officially shortened to &quot;Raiders&quot; starting with the 1970 album &quot;Collage&quot;. It drew a glowing review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, with critic Lenny Kaye singling out Lindsay for praise: &quot;[He] never fails to give the impression that he knows what he&#x27;s doing. Almost single-handedly, he&#x27;s brought the Raiders to a stronger position than they&#x27;ve occupied in years&quot;. &quot;Collage&quot; proved to be a commercial failure (#154 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200) and Lindsay began to turn toward solo projects. Joe Correro departed after their spring tour ended and replaced by his predecessor Mike Smith.

The Raiders achieved their greatest success with their cover of John D. Loudermilk&#x27;s &quot;Indian Reservation&quot;, which was brought to the band by Columbia A&amp;R man Jack Gold. Revere worked to promote the single and &quot;Indian Reservation&quot; peaked at No. 1 for one week in July 1971. It became Columbia&#x27;s biggest-selling single for almost a decade, clearing over six million units. The success of the single was followed by the album of the same name that reached No. 19 and consisted mainly of covers. The group expanded to include drummer Omar Martinez and keyboardist Bob Wooley.

The last Raiders album, &quot;Country Wine&quot; (1972), failed to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Later that year, they began preparation on follow up album, &quot;Love Music.&quot; The intended title track was released as a promotion for the project, but it reached only #97, marking the Raiders&#x27; final chart appearance and the album being shelved by Columbia. Without a chart presence, the band was relegated to playing lounges and state fairs as an &quot;oldies&quot; act, a situation Revere found pleasing, but not Lindsay. Weller and Smith departed in December 1972, Weller being replaced by guitarist Doug Heath.

===The later 1970s===
Lineup changes ensued in early 1975, with Mark Lindsay departing after a gig at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. He recorded two final singles for Warner Bros. records in 1977, then turned his attentions to film scoring and commercials. He was also head of A&amp;R (artists &amp; repertoire) for United Artists Records in the 1970s. Keith Allison departed in April 1975, to be replaced by Ron Foos.&quot;

Country music was the choice of former guitarist Freddy Weller, who had much success on the country charts before, starting with his country version of Joe South&#x27;s &quot;Games People Play&quot; in 1969 reaching no. 2 on the country charts as well as recording albums (his first two solo albums were produced by Mark Lindsay), and Top 10 singles on the country singles charts such as his covers of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Promised Land&quot;, the Cowsills&#x27; &quot;Indian Lake&quot;, as well as &quot;These Are Not My People&quot; and &quot;Another Night of Love&quot; for Columbia during this time while with the Raiders, as well as after leaving the Raiders. (Freddy&#x27;s stint was 1967–1973.)

In a memorable event, Revere married for the second time on July 4, Bicentennial Year 1976 onstage at a Raiders show. Revere announced his retirement from the music business at the end of 1976, but was back on the road by 1978 with a new cast of Raiders. Along with guitarist Doug Heath, Revere linked in this period with a group called &quot;Louie Fontaine &amp; the Rockets&quot;, and went on the road with them as &quot;Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders&quot;, featuring Blair Hill (&quot;Louie Fontaine&quot;) as lead vocalist. This configuration even appeared as &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Raiders&quot; without Paul, for a while in 1978. The &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Revere, Lindsay, Levin, Volk, and Smith reunited for a final time with Dick Clark on national television in 1979 and performed a medley of their biggest hits. The same year &quot;Indian Reservation&quot; was covered by the German group Orlando Riva Sound.

===The 1980s to 2014===

The punk rock and new wave eras saw a wave of interest in the Raiders&#x27; music; &quot;I&#x27;m Not Your Stepping Stone&quot; was covered by the Sex Pistols, Minor Threat, Berkeley&#x27;s Fang, and Liverpool band the Farm – although the Monkees&#x27; version was better known than the Raiders&#x27;. &quot;Just Like Me&quot; was covered by the Circle Jerks, Joan Jett and Pat Benatar. David Bowie covered &quot;Louie, Go Home&quot;. The Who recorded the song in 1965, changing the title and lyrics to &quot;Lubie (Come Back Home)&quot;, and released it in 1985 on a rarities album and in 2002 on the deluxe edition reissue of 
their first album &quot;My Generation&quot;. &quot;Hungry&quot; was covered by Sammy Hagar. The Flamin&#x27; Groovies tackled three Raiders songs (&quot;Him or Me – What&#x27;s It Gonna Be?&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Ups and Downs&quot;) and The Morrells did a country-tinged arrangement of &quot;Ups and Downs&quot; as well. The Paisley Underground, garage rock revival, and grunge movements all acknowledged the Raiders&#x27; influence. &quot;Kicks&quot; was covered by Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork of the Monkees as one of three new recordings included on their 1986 compilation, &quot;Then &amp; Now... The Best of The Monkees&quot;.

Mark Lindsay cut a version of &quot;Ups And Downs&quot; in 1994 with Carla Olson, which appeared on her &quot;Reap The Whirlwind&quot; album.

Revere continued with a relatively stable lineup through the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, featuring longtime members Omar Martinez (drums and vocals since 1972), Doug Heath (guitarist for the Raiders since 1973), Ron Foos (bass, Allison&#x27;s replacement in 1975), Danny Krause (keyboards, vocals since 1980) and lead vocalist Carlo Driggs (who replaced Michael Bradley). New record releases included the self-produced &quot;Special Edition&quot; in 1983, with Michael Bradley on vocals, and &quot;Paul Revere Rides Again&quot;, released in 1983 through Radio Shack stores. They also recorded a home video for MCA Universal in 1987 titled &quot;The Last Madman of Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;. Revere&#x27;s son Jamie joined the band on guitar for several years in the 1990s, featured on &quot;Generic Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (1992) and &quot;Generic Rock 2&quot; (1996).

On September 19, 1997, four of the group&#x27;s classic lineup (Lindsay, Levin, Volk and Smith) reunited in full costume (without Revere) for a 30th anniversary performance in Portland. In 2000 Sundazed Records released a two-CD package entitled &quot;Mojo Workout&quot; that focused on the R&amp;B and soul sounds from early in the Raiders&#x27; Columbia career. In 2001, the Raiders released &quot;Ride to the Wall&quot;, featuring several new songs, along with their versions of 1960s hits, with proceeds going to help veterans of the Vietnam War. They performed at Rolling Thunder&#x27;s Memorial Day event in Washington D.C. in 2001 for POW-MIA&#x27;s of the Vietnam era. A steady touring schedule kept Paul and his &quot;new Raiders&quot; in the public eye. Keith Allison, who played in the Raiders from 1968 to 1975, has since gone into acting, and appeared in the films &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; and &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; among others.

On October 13, 2007, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, along with their manager Roger Hart, were inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame. Lindsay, Volk, and Roger Hart were present to accept their awards. In 2010, the band was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. Revere announced his retirement from the band in August 2014; the group planned to tour without him as &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Raiders&quot;. In October 2014, the band&#x27;s web site announced that Revere had died &quot;peacefully&quot; on October 4, 2014, at his Garden Valley, Idaho home, a &quot;small estate overlooking a tranquil river canyon&quot;, from cancer. He was 76 years old.

On October 10, 2014, at the Los Angeles Forum, Tom Petty performed &quot;I&#x27;m Not Your Stepping Stone&quot;, dedicating it to Revere, acknowledging his death that week.

===Former Raiders and legacy===
Phil Volk tours with his own band, Fang &amp; The Gang. He was married to &quot;Where The Action Is&quot; regular Tina Mason from 1967 until her death in 2021.

After leaving the Raiders in 1967, Jim Valley continued to perform and hone his songwriting skills in a variety of acts. He was signed as a solo artist by Dunhill Records and released two singles. He subsequently moved back to his native Northwest, playing with several rock acts including Sweet Talking Jones and the Shoestring Orchestra &amp; Choir. He became an acclaimed and award-winning children&#x27;s music artist and educator, traveling the world as an emissary of the &quot;Rainbow Planet&quot;. Valley continues to work with children, write and record his own albums, as well as perform live.

Joe Correro Jr., the Raiders&#x27; drummer from 1967 to 1971, performs as part of the Los Angeles-based Richard Sherman Trio jazz combo. Bassist Mike &quot;Doc&quot; Holiday and guitarist/bassist Charlie Coe made a special guest appearance with Mark Lindsay at a show in Boise, Idaho in 1996. They both reside in Idaho. Righteous Brothers Bill Medley&#x27;s son, Darrin, sang and performed with Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders.

Another Darren, Darren Dowler, followed Darrin Medley as lead vocalist of the Raiders. Coincidentally, Darren Dowler also sang with Darrin Medley&#x27;s father&#x27;s group, the Righteous Brothers Band singing the parts formerly sung by tenor, recording great Bobby Hatfield. Dowler, the current vocalist, has also performed with the Lettermen, the Jordanaires, the Fifth Dimension, Gary Puckett, Mitch Ryder and was the first guitarist for the Backstreet Boys in 1991 before they hit mega stardom. Dowler, also an actor and filmmaker, appeared in such films as &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; with Billy Bob Thornton and &quot;Hancock&quot; with Will Smith. In 2014 he starred in, wrote, and directed the films &quot;Rock and Roll the Movie&quot; and &quot;Christmas In Hollywood&quot;. In 2014, Revere commissioned Dowler to compose an album of original songs for a new Raider album, the first all original album in 35 years.

After ending his second stint with the Raiders in 1972, drummer Mike &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith moved to Kona, Hawaii and continued performing for several groups in that region. He died of natural causes on March 6, 2001, at age 58.

Drake Levin became an accomplished blues guitarist, playing in and forming numerous groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. He died at his home in San Francisco on July 4, 2009, at the age of 62 after a long battle with cancer.

The group&#x27;s founder, vocalist and keyboard player Paul Revere died of cancer at his home in Garden Valley, Idaho on October 4, 2014, aged 76. His funeral, held at the Cathedral of the Rockies in Boise, Idaho, was attended by, amongst others, former Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne. The group then became &quot;Paul Revere’s Raiders&quot;, continuing to perform until April 3, 2022, after which the name was retired.

Carl &quot;Carlo&quot; Driggs, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders&#x27; longest-serving lead singer (a 20-year-plus span), was formerly lead vocalist for Kracker, a band that toured Europe as an opening act for (and had their albums distributed outside America by) the Rolling Stones. He followed this with his tenure in the Latin/disco group Foxy, who scored a no. 1 hit on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (no. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100) with &quot;Get Off&quot;, which was co-written by Driggs. On May 31, 2017, Driggs died of a heart attack at his home in Miami, Florida, at the age of 67.

Keith Allison, who was a member of the Raiders from 1968 to 1975, died at his home in Sherman Oaks, California on November 17, 2021, at the age of 79.

==Musical style and influences==
Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders were classified as a garage rock, proto-punk, rock and roll and pop band. The band&#x27;s early sound combined fast-paced, guitar-and-vocal-dominated rock with an intimidating R&amp;B flavor. before shifting to a psychedelic pop sound. Quentin Tarantino, who used music from the band in his film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019), categorized Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders as a bubblegum band.

1970&#x27;s &quot;Collage&quot; saw the band make an effort to distance themselves from their former image as an AM radio singles band, utilizing &quot;fuzzy guitar noodling, time signature changes, groovy horn charts à la Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, trippy headphone cross-fading, and other hip production techniques of the time,&quot; according to AllMusic&#x27;s Cub Koda. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album saw Mark Lindsay &quot;pushing the Raiders toward a harder rock, part way between the fuzz guitars of Grand Funk and horns of Chicago, accentuated by lingering affection for country-rock and soul.&quot;

==Legacy==
Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and their manager Roger Hart were inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame on 13 October 2007. In 2010 the band was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. The garage rock revival and grunge movements—and individual acts such as the Paisley Underground—have cited the Raiders as an influence.

In 2004, &quot;Kicks&quot; ranked no. 400 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Additionally, &quot;Just Like Me&quot; is included among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, set in 1969, featured three of the band&#x27;s top 20 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 —&quot;Hungry&quot; (1966), &quot;Good Thing&quot; (1966) and &quot;Mr. Sun, Mr. Moon&quot; (1969)—and the 1968 B-side &quot;Theme From It&#x27;s Happening&quot;.

<text>Amos Emerson Dolbear (; November 10, 1837 – February 23, 1910) was an American physicist and inventor. Dolbear researched electrical spark conversion into sound waves and electrical impulses. He was a professor at University of Kentucky in Lexington from 1868 until 1874. In 1874 he became the chair of the physics department at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. He is known for his 1882 invention of a system for transmitting telegraph signals without wires. In 1899 his patent for it was purchased in an unsuccessful attempt to interfere with Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s wireless telegraphy patents in the United States.

==Biography==
Amos Dolbear was born in Norwich, Connecticut, on November 10, 1837. He was a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University, in Delaware, Ohio. While a student there, he had made a &quot;talking telegraph&quot; and invented a receiver containing two features of the modern telephone: a permanent magnet and a metallic diaphragm that he made from a tintype. He invented the first telephone receiver with a permanent magnet in 1865, 11 years before Alexander Graham Bell patented his model. Later, Dolbear couldn&#x27;t prove his claim, so Bell kept the patent. Dolbear lost his case before the U. S. Supreme Court, (&quot;Dolbear et al. v. American Bell Telephone Company&quot;). The June 18, 1881, edition of &quot;Scientific American&quot; reported:
In 1876, Dolbear patented a magneto electric telephone. He patented a static telephone in 1879.
In 1883, Dolbear was able to communicate over a distance of a quarter of a mile without wires in the Earth. His device relied on conduction in the ground, which was different from later radio transmissions that used electromagnetic radiation. He received a U.S. patent for a wireless telegraph in March of that year. His set-up used phones grounded by metal rods poked into the earth. His transmission range was at least as much as a half a mile and he received a patent for this device, , in 1886. (He did not patent his system in Europe.)

In 1899, The New England Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Company, a subsidiary of the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, purchased Dolbear&#x27;s 1886 patent, and filed a suit against Marconi for infringement. However, in March 1901, a United States Circuit Court dismissed the suit. In April 1902, American Wireless petitioned Congress to extend the 1886 patent by ten years, but was unsuccessful, so it duly expired on October 4, 1903. In 1905, the New York Circuit Court further noted that the Dolbear patent was &quot;inoperative, and that, even if operative, it operates by virtue of radically different electrical laws and phenomena&quot; than the radio signaling used by Marconi.

In 1868 Dolbear (while a professor at Bethany College) invented the electrostatic telephone. He also invented the opeidoscope (an instrument for visualizing vibration of sound waves, using a mirror mounted on a membrane) and a system of incandescent lighting. He authored several books, articles, and pamphlets, and was recognized for his contributions to science at both the Paris Exposition in 1881 and the Crystal Palace Exposition in 1882.

In 1897, Dolbear published an article &quot;The Cricket as a Thermometer&quot; that noted the correlation between the ambient temperature and the rate at which crickets chirp. The formula expressed in that article became known as Dolbear&#x27;s Law.

In 1899, after the demonstration by Ernest A. Hummel of the telediagraph, an apparatus allowing the transmission of pictures by wire, Dolbear claimed to have invented such an apparatus in 1864 (&quot;Norwich Bulletin&quot;, 26 April 1899). 

He died at his home in Medford on February 23, 1910.

In 2008, Kent Biffle of the Dallas Morning News reported receiving newspaper clippings from a local lawyer and historian on the subject of UFO sightings in Stephenville, Texas. Apparently in 1897, widespread newspaper reports of a cigar-shaped flying object started to circulate in the Midwest and Southwest. Responding to sightings previously reported in the Morning News, on April 17, 1897, one respected Erath County farmer, C.L. McIlhany discovered such a craft had landed on his property, and reported two human operators, a pilot and an engineer, who gave their names as &quot;S.E. Tilman&quot; and &quot;A.E. Dolbear.&quot; The two operators performed minor repairs on their electrically powered lighter-than-air craft, then again flew away.

<text>Jill Sobule ( ; born January 16, 1959) is an American singer-songwriter best known for the 1995 single &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Supermodel&quot; from the soundtrack of the 1995 film &quot;Clueless&quot;. Her folk-inflected compositions alternate between ironic, story-driven character studies and emotive ballads, a duality reminiscent of such 1970s American songwriters as Warren Zevon, Harry Nilsson, Loudon Wainwright III, Harry Chapin, and Randy Newman. Autobiographical elements, including Sobule&#x27;s Jewish heritage and her adolescent battles with anorexia and depression, frequently occur in Sobule&#x27;s writing.

In 2009, she released &quot;California Years&quot;, an album funded entirely by fan donations, making her an early pioneer of crowdfunding.

==History and studio recordings==

To date Sobule has released eight studio albums of original songs, four EPs, and a greatest hits compilation album. Sobule&#x27;s output also includes original songs available only via the Internet, a cover of Robert Earl Keen&#x27;s Christmas novelty track &quot;Merry Christmas from the Family,&quot; and a version of the late Warren Zevon&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Us Get Sick&quot; included on both Sobule&#x27;s acoustic album and on a posthumous Zevon tribute record.

===1990s===
Sobule&#x27;s debut album &quot;Things Here Are Different&quot; was released in 1990. Produced by pop legend Todd Rundgren, the album failed to sell. During this period a follow-up record was produced by British New Wave rocker Joe Jackson (for whom she opened during 1991) but Sobule was dropped from her label and the second record was never released. It was five years before Sobule landed another recording contract.

Her 1995 album &quot;Jill Sobule&quot; established Sobule as part of a fruitful mid-90s movement of female singer-songwriters that included such artists as Lisa Loeb, Juliana Hatfield and Alanis Morissette. The album contains Sobule&#x27;s best-known composition &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, a story-song about a lesbian flirtation between two suburban girlfriends which became an unlikely radio success thanks in part to a comedic music video featuring beefcake model Fabio Lanzoni. &quot;Supermodel&quot; (sample lyric: &quot;I didn&#x27;t eat yesterday ... and I&#x27;m not gonna eat today ... and I&#x27;m not gonna eat tomorrow ... &#x27;Cause I&#x27;m gonna be a supermodel&quot;) managed to both send up and celebrate American teenage lifestyles, and became well known after its inclusion in 1995&#x27;s hit teen comedy film &quot;Clueless&quot;.

The &quot;Jill Sobule&quot; album seemed to establish Sobule&#x27;s commercial prospects, but her third album slowed that momentum while setting what has so far been the musical and production patterns for the rest of her career. 1997&#x27;s &quot;Happy Town&quot; featured Sobule&#x27;s most elaborate pop productions to date and contains songs about an eclectic range of topics including reactionary Christianity (&quot;Soldiers of Christ&quot;), the negative impact of anti-depressant medication on the libido (&quot;Happy Town&quot;), and a track that uses Anne Frank&#x27;s enforced Nazi-era hibernation as the metaphor for a love song (&quot;Attic&quot;). Though embraced by record reviewers from publications as diverse as &quot;The Advocate&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Happy Town&quot; sold poorly, simultaneously solidifying Sobule&#x27;s critical reputation while stalling her commercial momentum.

===2000s===
The 2000 record &quot;Pink Pearl&quot; may be Sobule&#x27;s most characteristic set. It is anchored by three female character studies: &quot;Lucy at the Gym&quot;, about an anorexic exercise addict; &quot;Claire&quot;, about an aging lesbian aviator succumbing to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; and &quot;Mary Kay&quot;, about Mary Kay Letourneau, the notorious real-life schoolteacher who became impregnated and was imprisoned as the result of the statutory rape of a 13-year-old male student, whom she married when he reached the age of consent.

&quot;Pink Pearl&quot; also contains some of Sobule&#x27;s most directly confessional songwriting, especially the atheist&#x27;s prayer &quot;Somewhere in New Mexico&quot; and the insomniac&#x27;s lullaby &quot;Rock Me To Sleep&quot;. Don Henley contributed a promotional quotation to the ad campaign for the album and selected Sobule to open for him during his solo tour that year.

In 2004, Sobule self-released an album of acoustic tracks titled &quot;The Folk Years 2003–2003&quot;. In addition to some of her rarer compositions and several tracks that would later receive fuller arrangements on Sobule&#x27;s next major-label release, Sobule performed offbeat cover versions of such standards as the Doris Day theme song &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot; and &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot; from the Broadway musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

The more elaborately recorded &quot;Underdog Victorious&quot;, also released in 2004, was one of the last albums distributed by legendary personal manager and media entrepreneur Danny Goldberg&#x27;s now-defunct Artemis Records. The liquidation of Artemis Records led Sobule to extend her experiments with online music distribution and to relocate from New York City to Los Angeles. She continued to write and perform prolifically and to compose original music for television, including for the popular &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; series &quot;Unfabulous&quot;.

Sobule also acted and performed her songs in writer-director Eric Schaeffer&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Mind the Gap&quot;, as a street musician in Astoria, Queens with a heart condition, who aspires to play in Manhattan.

In mid-January 2008, Sobule launched a website, jillsnextrecord.com, which sought to raise $75,000 through fan donations in order to produce, manufacture, distribute and promote an upcoming studio album. In exchange for their donations, Sobule offered her patrons an assortment of rewards with values commensurate with the amount of the donation. These ranged from a free download of the album upon its release ($10) to the opportunity to attend a recording session and sing on the record ($10,000).

On March 8, 2008, 53 days after the public launch of the site, Sobule reached her target through donations from more than 500 people in 44 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and 11 foreign countries. The subsequent album, &quot;California Years,&quot; was released on April 14, 2009 on Sobule&#x27;s own label, Pinko Records.

On Sobule&#x27;s next record &quot;Dottie&#x27;s Charms&quot; in 2014, she put music to lyrics of her friends and favorite authors including David Hajdu, Jonathan Lethem, Vendela Vida and Lucy Sante, with each song relating to individual charms on an antique charm bracelet she had been given.

In 2018, Sobule again used crowd funding to assist with the production of her next album, &quot;Nostalgia Kills&quot;. Rolling Stone listed the first single from the album, &quot;Island of Lost Things&quot;, among the 10 best new country and Americana songs.

Since 2020, Sobule has acted as musician-in-residence at the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice, an LGBTQIA community center.

==Collaborations==

In the late 90s, Sobule toured with Richard Barone as &quot;The Richard &amp; Jill Show&quot;. Together they wrote &quot;Bitter&quot; on &quot;Happy Town&quot;, &quot;Rock Me To Sleep&quot; on &quot;Pink Pearl&quot;, &quot;Big Shoes&quot; on &quot;I Never Learned to Swim&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for the Train&quot; on Barone&#x27;s &quot;Clouds Over Eden&quot; album. They also appeared together (as Mr. and Mrs. Sobule) in the underground film &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot;, which featured another of their compositions, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Queer&quot;. The pair continue to collaborate, including &quot;Odd Girl Out&quot; for Barone&#x27;s 2010 album, &quot;Glow&quot; (Bar/None Records), and to perform together. Their songs have been used on &quot;The West Wing&quot;. &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;South of Nowhere&quot; and other television shows. In 2018, Barone produced and sang backing vocals on &quot;Island of Lost Things&quot; on Sobule&#x27;s album &quot;Nostalgia Kills&quot;.

In 1997-1998, Sobule joined Lloyd Cole&#x27;s short-lived band The Negatives.

In 2004, she played one of the five leads in the film &quot;Mind The Gap&quot; with six of her songs featured on the soundtrack.

In 2005, Sobule contributed music to &quot;Unfabulous&quot;, a popular &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; TV series about a 13-year-old aspiring songwriter, including a title song performed by Sobule under the program&#x27;s opening credits. Four Sobule compositions or co-compositions appear on the series star&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Unfabulous and More: Emma Roberts&quot;: credits a Roberts cover version of &quot;Mexican Wrestler&quot; from Sobule&#x27;s album &quot;Pink Pearl;&quot; &quot;Punch Rocker&quot; and &quot;94 Weeks (Metal Mouth Freak),&quot; both written by Sobule for Roberts&#x27; character to &quot;compose&quot; on the program; and &quot;New Shoes,&quot; a track co-written by Sobule with &quot;Unfabulous&quot; series creator Sue Rose.

In 2006, Sobule met Julia Sweeney, the actress, writer and comedian, and started performing the &quot;Jill and Julia Show&quot;, a compilation of songs and stories. They performed at the James Randi Educational Foundation meeting in Las Vegas on January 19, 2007, as well as at regular showings for the Groundlings Theater in Los Angeles. Also in 2006, Sobule created a theme song for blogger Arianna Huffington&#x27;s self-help book &quot;On Becoming Fearless&quot;.

In 2007, Sobule teamed up with John Doe to produce and record a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Down by the River&quot; for the American Laundromat Records benefit CD &quot;Cinnamon Girl – Women Artists Cover Neil Young For Charity&quot;. Other contributing artists included Lori McKenna, Tanya Donelly, Josie Cotton, Kristin Hersh, Britta Phillips, and The Watsons Twins.

Also in 2007, Sobule&#x27;s song &quot;San Francisco&quot; became the first single released by Don Was as part of his Wasmopolitan Cavalcade of Recorded Music, an advertiser-sponsored means for the recording and distribution of new music, part of the multimedia website mydamnchannel.com. The pair also collaborated on a 16-minute concert video entitled &quot;Jill Sobule&#x27;s Dance Party,&quot; distributed for free in two parts on both mydamnchannel.com and YouTube.

In May 2008, Sobule released a CD of music from &quot;Prozak and the Platypus&quot;, a multi-media collaboration of Sobule, playwright Elise Thoron, and graphic artist KellyAnne Hanrahan. The play, written by Thoron (book, lyrics) and Sobule (music) and illustrated in a graphic novella by Hanrahan, tells the story of a fierce young woman, Sara (a musician) and her father Arvin, a neuroscientist, who relocates his family from Los Angeles to Brisbane, Australia to study REM sleep in the platypus, a unique species native to Australia. Shattered by her mother&#x27;s recent suicide and unhappy with the side-effects of her own treatment for depression, Sara renames herself &quot;Prozak,&quot; rages through her songwriting, and rebels. Meanwhile, in her father&#x27;s lab, Sara finds an unexpected confidant in her father&#x27;s current lab subject, a jaunty platypus who speaks to her and calls himself &quot;Frankie&quot;. In the piece, according to its website, &quot;Music club and science lab become testing grounds in which angry teen and scientist father pit aboriginal mythology against modern neuroscience research. The dreams of a platypus prove to be the link between the two.&quot;

In 2009-10, Sobule performed with Julia Sweeney in a revue called &quot;Jill and Julia&quot;. Sobule and Sweeney originally met at a TED (conference) and performed together at TED in 2008. They brought the show on the road in 2009 and 2010, performing in New York and Denver among other locations. The show is an autobiographical mix of music, stories and commentary.

==Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;==
In 2008, Katy Perry issued her own &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; for her debut album &quot;One of the Boys&quot;. The song received mixed reviews but skyrocketed to #1. 
Sobule shared her feelings about Perry&#x27;s song and use of the title in a July 2009 interview with The Rumpus:

Days later, in an article she wrote for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Sobule stated:

== Etymology ==

Krishna District with its district headquarters at Machilipatnam is the coastal district of Andhra Pradesh. It was formerly called as Machilipatnam District. Later it was renamed as Krishna District after the holy river Krishna, by adding certain Taluks of the abolished Guntur District in 1859. Again in 1925, Krishna District was further divided into Krishna and West Godavari Districts. There are no changes in its jurisdiction except some minor changes (in Divi Taluk and Munagala Paragana). Further Again in 2022 Krishna District was divided into Krishna and NTR Districts. It was named after the Krishna River (also known as Krishnaveni in literature) the third longest river in India. The river flows through the district before it empties itself into Bay of Bengal, near Hamsaladevi village.

== History ==

The history of this region dates back to the 2nd century BCE. The area was ruled by the Satavahanas (230 BCAD 227); Pallavas (AD 340AD 500), Chalukyas (AD 6151070 AD) and later by Cholas, Kakatiyas, Musunuri Nayaks, Reddy dynasty and Gajapati kings of Odisha.

&quot;Satavahana period&quot; (230 BCAD 227): The Satavahanas ruled this region with headquarters at Srikakulam, at present a village in Ghantasala mandal of the district. Prominent rulers during this period were Srimukha (founder), Gotamiputra Satakarni and Yajnasri Satakarni (last Satavahana king). The Satavahanas imparted more stability and security to the life of the people of the region for more than four centuries.

&quot;Pallava Kingdom&quot; (AD 340AD 500), spread over from Krishna river to Tungabhadra, including Amaravati in the East, Bellary in the West and Kancheepuram in the South with capital cities at Venginagar near Eluru and Pithapuram, both in Vengidesa. &quot;Bruhitpalayanas&quot;, the contemporaries of Pallavas ruled the district with Koduru as their capital. &quot;Vishnukundinas&quot; (AD 6th century) rulers created cave temples at Mogalrajapuram (now in Vijayawada) and Undavalli.

&quot;Eastern chalukyas&quot; (AD 615AD 1070), the entire Andhra country was under the control of a single ruler under their reign. The Eastern Chalukyas were credited with the excavations of the cave temple at Undavalli, rock cut shrines, and Shiva temples.

&quot;Cholas&quot; ruled this region with their capital located at Rajamahendri. It was during Rajaraja Narendra&#x27;s reign that Nannayya Bhattu translated the Mahabharata into Telugu. &quot;Kakatiyas&quot; ruled this region up to the early 14th century with Orugallu as their capital. They are followed by Musunuri Nayaks who rebelled against Delhi sultanate and won. Musunuri Nayaks constructed various forts in South India including Hampi and ruled many states of India independently. &quot;Reddy dynasty&quot; a subordinate of Musunuri Kapaya Naidu established himself in the hill fort of Kondaveedu. The Kondaveedu Reddis were great patrons of Telugu literature. The poet Srinadha and his brother-in-law Bammera Pothana flourished at his court. 

&quot;Gajapathis&quot; of Odisha: Kapileswarapuram named in honour of Kapileswara Gajapathi now in Pamidimukkala mandal exists to this day. He was succeeded by Vidyadhara Gajapathi who built Vidyadharapuram (now in Vijayawada) and constructed a reservoir at Kondapalli. Krishnadevaraya of &quot;Vijayanagara empire&quot; conquered this region in the early 16th century. Then this region became part of the Kingdom of Golconda in 1550 which was founded by Sultan Quli Qutub Shah as part of the &quot;Qutb Shahis&quot; in 1512.

&quot;The British&quot;: In the year 1611 the English founded their settlement at Masulipatnam which remained their headquarters until they finally moved to Madras in 1641. The Dutch and French also had settlements at Masulipatnam. Upon the death of the old Nizam-ul-Mulk in June 1748, his heirs strove for the succession with the support of the English and the French. When Nizam Ali Khan was proclaimed ruler of Golconda in 1761, the British secured at first the divisions of Masulipatnam, Nizampatnam and part of Kondaveedu and later the entire Circars. At first the district was administered by a chief and council at Masulipatnam but in 1794 Collectors, directly responsible to the Board of Revenue, were appointed at Masulipatnam.

<text>Daana Veera Soora Karna () is a 1977 Indian Telugu-language Hindu mythological film co-written, produced and directed by N. T. Rama Rao under his banner Ramakrishna Cine Studios. Based on the life of Karna from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the film stars Rama Rao in three roles: the title character Karna, Duryodhana, and Krishna. The music was composed by composed by Pendyala Nageswara Rao.

The film focuses on Karna&#x27;s life, his deep loyalty to Duryodhana, and the moral dilemmas he faces. Duryodhana, traditionally portrayed as an antagonist in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, is shown here in a more positive light as a knowledgeable and loyal friend to Karna. This sympathetic portrayal of Duryodhana, first introduced in Rama Rao&#x27;s earlier film &quot;Sri Krishna Pandaveeyam&quot; (1966), is expanded upon in &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot;.

Produced on a budget of ₹10 lakh, &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; became a significant commercial success, emerging as the highest-grossing Telugu film of its time with a distributor share of ₹1.5–2 crore. It is regarded as a classic in Telugu mythological cinema.

== Plot ==

A baby is discovered floating in the Ganga river by a charioteer named Adhiratha, who adopts and names the boy Karna. As Karna grows up, he witnesses the injustice of Dronacharya removing Ekalavya&#x27;s thumb to ensure Arjuna becomes the foremost archer. Outraged by this act, Karna vows to one day surpass Arjuna.

Karna later becomes a student of Parasurama, seeking to master the art of archery. One day, while Parasurama sleeps, Indra, disguised as an insect, bites Karna. Despite the pain, Karna remains still to avoid waking his guru. When Parasurama sees the blood, he mistakenly believes Karna to be of the Kshatriya caste and curses that Karna&#x27;s skills would fail him when he needs them the most. Although Parasurama later realizes that Karna is a Sūtaputra (son of a charioteer), he cannot revoke the curse.

During his travels, Karna attempts to save a Brahmin&#x27;s cow from Indra, who is in the form of a lion. Failing to do so, Karna incurs another curse from the Brahmin, foretelling that Karna will die in a helpless situation. Additionally, Karna, moved by a young girl&#x27;s distress, squeezes ghee from the soil to restore her spilled offering. For disturbing the earth, Bhudevi curses Karna that his chariot wheel will get stuck in the ground at a critical moment during battle.

At an archery competition in Hastinapuram, Karna arrives to challenge Arjuna but is insulted due to his lower birth. Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, defends Karna by crowning him king of Anga. Grateful, Karna pledges his loyalty to Duryodhana, and the two become close friends. When Dharmaraja, the eldest Pandava, challenges Duryodhana to a dice game, Dharmaraja loses everything to Sakuni&#x27;s manipulation, forcing the Pandavas into exile.

As tensions rise before the Kurukshetra War, Lord Krishna reveals Karna’s true parentage—he is Kunti&#x27;s firstborn son and the eldest Pandava. However, Karna remains loyal to Duryodhana. During the war preparations, Bhishma, the Kaurava commander, refuses to allow Karna to fight, labeling him &quot;Ardharatha&quot; (half a charioteer), a term implying his lower status. Karna swears not to fight until Bhishma is incapacitated. After Bhishma falls on the battlefield, Karna receives his blessing and joins the war.

On the battlefield, Karna faces Abhimanyu, Arjuna’s son, who has been wreaking havoc on the Kaurava forces. Duryodhana orders Karna to destroy Abhimanyu&#x27;s bow, which leads to Abhimanyu&#x27;s death. Karna mourns the loss, recognizing Abhimanyu’s courage and lamenting his role in the young warrior&#x27;s death.

Later, Kunti approaches Karna and begs him to join the Pandavas or at least spare them in battle. Karna agrees not to kill any of the Pandavas except Arjuna, promising that Kunti will still have five sons, whether he or Arjuna survives. During the subsequent battles, Karna repeatedly spares the lives of the Pandavas, though he defeats them in combat. After the deaths of his own sons at the hands of the Pandavas, Karna declares that he has sacrificed his sons for Kunti&#x27;s.

Indra, disguised as a Brahmin, tricks Karna into surrendering his divine armor (Kavacha) and earrings (Kundala), which protect him from harm. In return, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, the Vasavi Sakthi, for one-time use. Though Karna hopes to use this weapon against Arjuna, he is forced to deploy it during a night attack, losing his advantage.

On the final day of battle, Salya, an uncle of the Pandavas, serves as Karna’s charioteer and demoralizes him, as per Krishna’s plan. Karna&#x27;s accumulated curses take effect as his chariot wheel becomes stuck in the battlefield. In his moment of helplessness, Karna calls upon Arjuna to honour the warrior code and allow him to free his chariot, but Krishna urges Arjuna to strike. Arjuna kills Karna, aided by Krishna&#x27;s guidance.

After Karna&#x27;s death, Krishna explains Karna&#x27;s sacrifices and valoir to Arjuna. Kunti reveals Karna’s true identity to the Pandavas, leading Dharmaraja to curse all women for keeping secrets. Karna&#x27;s soul ascends to Surya, the Sun God. Duryodhana mourns the loss of his closest friend and attempts to abandon the war, but Krishna convinces him to continue.

In the final duel, Duryodhana chooses Bhima as his opponent. Following Krishna&#x27;s advice, Bhima strikes Duryodhana&#x27;s thigh, a dishonorable move that ultimately kills him. As Duryodhana lies dying, he questions Krishna&#x27;s righteousness. After their deaths, Karna and Duryodhana are reunited in heaven, their unbreakable bond enduring beyond life.

==Production==

=== Development ===
&quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; was launched on 7 June 1976 at Ramakrishna Cine Studios in Hyderabad with M. G. Ramachandran giving the inaugural clap. It was the first shot at Ramakrishna Cine Studios. N. T. Rama Rao, who produced, directed, and played three key roles in the film (Karna, Krishna, and Duryodhana), intended to release the film for the Sankranti festival in 1977. During the planning stages, Rama Rao became aware that actor Krishna was preparing to make &quot;Kurukshetram&quot; (1977), with a story line similar to &quot;Dana Veera Soora Karna&quot;. This prompted Rama Rao to start the film immediately to ensure a timely release for Sankranti. 

The film&#x27;s dialogues were written by Kondaveeti Venkatakavi, a scholar and Sanskrit college principal, who initially declined the offer due to his atheistic beliefs but eventually agreed after Rama Rao&#x27;s personal request. While most mythological and folkloric movies since the 1950s used colloquial language (Vaduka Bhasha), &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; distinguished itself by employing a formal literary style (Granthika Bhasha) throughout.

=== Casting ===
Rama Rao initially wanted Akkineni Nageswara Rao to play Krishna in &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot;, but Nageswara Rao declined due to concerns over screen presence. Even after a request from Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jalagam Vengala Rao, who assured him that audiences would appreciate the collaboration, Nageswara Rao refused the role. However, Rama Rao later cast him as Chanakya in &quot;Chanakya Chandragupta&quot; (1977), a role Nageswara Rao had shown interest in.

Harikrishna and Balakrishna, Rama Rao&#x27;s sons, played the roles of Arjuna and Abhimanyu, respectively. This marked the second and final film where Rama Rao, Harikrishna, and Balakrishna worked together. Madala Ranga Rao was initially cast as Arjuna but was replaced by Harikrishna following a disagreement over Rama Rao&#x27;s strict rule that all actors maintain a vegetarian diet during the production of the mythological film.

During the film’s production, Rama Rao imposed conditions on actors, including prohibiting them from working on Krishna&#x27;s &quot;Kurukshetram&quot; simultaneously, as both films were being made at the same time. However, exception was made for Kaikala Satyanarayana, who acted in both films. Satyanarayana portrayed Bhima in &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; and Duryodhana in &quot;Kurukshetram&quot;. Sarada, initially apprehensive about working with Rama Rao due to his strict nature, played the role of Draupadi and later became more comfortable after her first day&#x27;s shoot.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; was completed in 43 working days, a record at the time, considering that N. T. Rama Rao required at least three hours for makeup and two hours for removal for each of his three roles. Rama Rao typically did not review rushes before release, allowing the film to be edited quickly without pre-screening. The Mayasabha set was not finished during filming, so Rama Rao filmed close-ups while the paintings were still in progress and wide shots once they were completed. The film was shot entirely at Ramakrishna Cine Studios, with no major location shoots.

== Music ==
The film&#x27;s music was composed by Pendyala Nageswara Rao, who completed the majority of the soundtrack. Initially, Saluri Rajeswara Rao contributed by composing the song &quot;Ye Thalli Ninu Kannadho&quot; along with many verses. However, only Pendyala Nageswara Rao&#x27;s name appears in the title credits.

&quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; features ten songs and thirty-five verses, making it one of the most song-heavy films in Telugu cinema, surpassed only by &quot;Lava Kusa&quot; (1963). Many of the verses were adapted from &quot;Paandavodyoga Vijayam&quot; and &quot;Sree Krishna Raayabaram&quot;, written by the poet duo Tirupati Venkata Kavulu. Pundareekakshayya, who held the rights to these verses for &quot;Sri Krishnavataram&quot; (1967), was offered a blank cheque by Krishna for their use in &quot;Kurukshetram&quot;. However, he chose to give the rights to N. T. Rama Rao for free, allowing &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; to use them.
== Release ==

=== Reception ===
The film received widespread acclaim, particularly for N. T. Rama Rao&#x27;s portrayal of three distinct characters and Kondaveeti Venkatakavi&#x27;s powerful dialogues. Rama Rao&#x27;s innovative reimagining of Duryodhana as &quot;Suyodhana,&quot; a noble and virtuous leader, deviated from the traditional negative portrayal and was well-received by audiences. The film&#x27;s complex and classical Telugu (Grandhikam) dialogues, while challenging for some viewers to follow, contributed to the film&#x27;s authenticity and grandeur. These dialogues became immensely popular, with their recordings released on LP records and audio cassettes, which sold in large numbers.

=== Box Office ===
&quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; was censored on January 12, 1977, and released on January 14. Initially distributed with 30 prints, Gemini Labs could not print all of them in the limited time available. Consequently, the film was released in 14 centers on the first day and expanded to 16 centers the following day.

The film achieved significant box office success, running for 100 days in nine centers and 250 days at the Shanti Theatre in Hyderabad. This success solidified N. T. Rama Rao&#x27;s reputation as a leading figure in mythological cinema. Produced on a budget of less than ₹10 lakh, &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; grossed over ₹1 crore during its initial run. It was the second Telugu film to collect ₹1 crore after &quot;Lava Kusa&quot; (1963). For its 1994 re-release, the film once again earned over ₹1 crore in revenue.

== Awards ==
*P. Susheela won Nandi Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the song &quot;Ye Thalli Ninu Kannado&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Wake&quot; (PR-3) was a United States Navy river gunboat operating on the Yangtze River. Originally commissioned as the gunboat Guam&quot; (PG-43), she was redesignated river patrol vesselPR-3in 1928, and renamed Wake&quot; 23 January 1941. She was captured by Japan on 8 December 1941 and renamed &quot;Tatara&quot;. After her recapture in 1945, she was transferred to Chinese nationalists, who renamed her &quot;Tai Yuan&quot;. Communist forces captured her in 1949. On 1 May 1949 &quot;Tai Yuan&quot; was sunk by Nationalist aircraft in the Caishiji River.

==Service history==

===U.S. Navy===
She was launched on 28 May 1927 as &quot;Guam&quot; by the Kiangnan Dock and Engineering Works in Shanghai, China, and commissioned on 28 December 1927. Her primary mission was to ensure the safety of American missionaries and other foreigners. Later, the ship also functioned as a &quot;radio spy ship,&quot; keeping track of Japanese movements. However, by 1939, she was &quot;escorted&quot; by a Japanese warship wherever she went, as China fell more and more under Imperial Japanese control.

In 1930 when it was nearing Yochow it was shot at by rebels, which killed one crew.

On 23 January 1941, she was renamed Wake, as &quot;Guam&quot; was to be the new name of a large cruiser being built in the U.S. 
On 25 November 1941, LCDR Andrew Earl Harris, the brother of Field Harris, was ordered to close the Navy installation at Hankou, and sail to Shanghai. On 28 November 1941, LCDR Harris and most of the crew were transferred to gunboats and ordered to sail to the Philippines. Columbus Darwin Smith—an old Chinese hand who had been piloting river boats on the Yangtze River—was asked to accept a commission in the U.S. Navy and was appointed captain of &quot;Wake&quot; with the rank of Lt. Commander.

When Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7th, 1941. Shanghai had been under Japanese occupation since the 1937 Battle of Shanghai. Smith was in command on 8 December 1941 (7 December in Hawaii), with a crew of 14, when the Japanese captured the ship, which was tied up at a pier in Shanghai. Smith had received a telephone call the night before from a Japanese officer he knew. The officer asked where Smith would be the next morning as he wanted to deliver some turkeys for Smith and his crew. The Japanese did the same to other American officers and officials to determine where they would be on 8 December. However, Commander Smith received word from his quartermaster about the Pearl Harbor attack and rushed to the ship only to find it under guard by the Japanese. Surrounded by an overwhelming Japanese force, the crew attempted unsuccessfully to scuttle the craft. &quot;Wake&quot; surrendered, the only U.S. ship to do so in World War II.

Commander Smith and his crew were confined to a prison camp near Shanghai, where the U.S. Marines and sailors captured on Wake Island were also later imprisoned.

===Japanese service===
The Japanese gave &quot;Wake&quot; to their puppet Wang Jingwei regime in Nanjing, where she was renamed . The following activities are known to have occurred during the war.
The ship was part of Sasebo Naval District for China Area Fleet.

===Post-war===
In 1945, at the end of the war, she was returned to the U.S. when the Japanese troops surrendered (VJ Day). The U.S. gave the ship to the Chinese nationalists, who renamed her &quot;Tai Yuan&quot; (太原). Finally, the ship was captured by Communist Chinese forces in 1949. On 1 May 1949 Tai Yuan was sunk by Nationalist aircraft in the Caishiji River.

As of 2019, no other ship of the U.S. Navy has been named &quot;Wake&quot;, though a launched in 1943 was named . Wake Island is a remote Pacific island used as a US military base, and the site of a WW2 Battle in December 1941 (Battle of Wake Island).

<text>The Mindset is an Intel 80186-based MS-DOS personal computer. It was developed by the Mindset Corporation and released in spring 1984. Unlike other IBM PC compatibles of the time, it has custom graphics hardware supporting a 320×200 resolution with 16 simultaneous colors (chosen from a 512-shade palette) and hardware-accelerated drawing capabilities, including a blitter, allowing it to update the screen 50 times as fast as an IBM standard color graphics adapter. The basic unit was priced at . It is conceptually similar to the more successful Amiga released over a year later. Key engineers of both the Amiga and Mindset were ex-Atari, Inc. employees.

The system didn&#x27;t sell well and was only on the market for about a year. This was lamented by industry commenters, who saw compatibility taking precedence over innovation. Its distinctive case remains in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

==History==
Roger Badertscher was head of Atari, Inc.&#x27;s Home Computer Division until 1982 when he resigned in order to set up a new company to produce a new personal computer. As president of Mindset Corporation, he brought a number of Atari engineers with him.

===Design===
In most computer systems of the era, the CPU is used to create graphics by drawing bit patterns directly into memory. Separate hardware then reads these patterns and produces the actual video signal for the display. The Mindset added a new custom-designed VLSI vector processor to handle many common drawing tasks, like lines or filling areas. Instead of the CPU doing all of this work by changing memory directly, in the Mindset the CPU sets up those instructions and then hands off the actual bit fiddling to the separate processor.

Badertscher compared the chipset to the Intel 8087 floating-point processor, running alongside the Intel 80186 on which the machine is based. There are a number of parallels between the Mindset and the Amiga 1000, another computer designed by ex-Atari engineers that offered advanced graphics.

The Mindset&#x27;s look was designed by Robert Brunner who would go on to provide design and direction for all Apple product lines from 1989-1997. His distinctive case for the Mindset is included by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in its permanent collection.

As development continued and it became clear that the machine would be ready before the MS-DOS-based Microsoft Windows 1.0 was, Bill Gates became personally involved in the project to assist Mindset in emulating IBM character graphics without losing performance. Once Mindset officials determined that most of the desirable software was compatible, development was frozen and the OS burned to ROM in late 1983. The ROM does not run about 20% of the PC software base, including Microsoft Flight Simulator. WordStar is one of the PC applications reported to run, and Mindset publicized a list of 60 applications that run unmodified. The software base was expected to increase dramatically once a final version of Windows was released.

Before its release, in early 1984 Jack Tramiel is rumored to have tried to buy Mindset&#x27;s technology. before ultimately buying Atari and designing a new machine from off-the-shelf parts, the Atari ST.

===Release===

The Mindset was released on 2 May 1984. The base model with 64 KB RAM (32 KB user RAM, 32 KB VRAM) and no floppy-disk drive sold for US$1,099, a 128 KB (user RAM) model with single disk was available for $1,798, and a 256 KB (user RAM) dual-disk version cost $2,398. The disk-less version of the machine was still usable, as the system also included two ROM cartridge ports on the front of the machine that could be used for the operating system and another program. The canonical cartridge is an extended version of GW-BASIC. The machine is packaged in a unique enclosure designed by GVO of Menlo Park, visually separated into two sections with the ROM slots in the lower half and the optional diskettes on the upper half. It was sold complete with a custom nylon carrying case.

Mindset&#x27;s president said its graphics capabilities were unmatched except on US$50,000 workstations. At the time it garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers universally praising its graphics and overall performance which was much faster than contemporary PCs. although in many cases with the caveat that the market was rapidly standardizing.

===Disappearance===
By the summer of 1984, it was clear the system was not selling as expected, and the company re-purposed it for the video production and graphics design markets. That was followed in August by a round of layoffs, and another in January 1985, this time half the employees were let go. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection on 28 August 1985, and never emerged.

By 1985, when it was clear the system was not living up to its promise and Windows 1.0 was a flop in general, John J. Anderson published a review of the system decrying that the personal computer market was beginning to value compatibility over technology. He wrote:

===Mindset II===
The Base System Unit is referred to as Model M1001; later a &quot;Mindset II&quot; computer was released, a badge engineered version of the M1001, with an adhesive label designating &quot;II&quot; under the embossed name. Internally the Video Processor Board is a separate mini-daughterboard. Its enhanced functionality is not totally understood – but from the &quot;Mindset II Advanced Professional Videographics System&quot; user&#x27;s guide it makes mention of &quot;Chaining&quot; two Mindset&#x27;s:

The Mindset II is referred to on the front of the user guide as Model# M1500, however other internal pages reference is an M1000-II and also make mention of Mindset Video Production Module Model# M1011. The system included 512 KB system RAM, 128 KB VRAM, and 40 KB ROM. The primary resolution was 640x400, 4-color, double-buffered.

==Description==
The system architecture is based on the Intel 80186, with proprietary VLSI chips that enhance and speed up the graphics. Although it is disk compatible with the IBM PC&#x27;s DOS, its enhanced graphics capabilities make achieving full IBM compatibility more difficult than its competitors. Bill Gates became involved with development, assisting Mindset in emulating IBM character graphics without losing performance. Once Mindset officials determined that most of the desirable software was compatible, development was frozen and the OS burned to ROM, which locked out 20% of the PC software base, including &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;. WordStar is one of the PC applications reported to run, and Mindset publicized a list of 60 applications that run unmodified. The software base was expected to increase dramatically once a final version of Windows was released.

Mindset&#x27;s design is modular in many aspects. The top of the case has an opening to access its system bus; this allows for the expansion module to plug into the main computer module to add memory and one or two disk drives. The Mindset was designed by several ex-Atari engineers like the Amiga 1000, another computer of the era with an advanced graphics subsystem and modular expandability. Jack Tramiel (forming Tramel Technology, Ltd.) tried to buy Mindset&#x27;s technology in Spring of 1984.

A dual 5.25-inch floppy drive module that sits above the main unit was available and part of the common sales configuration for the system. The module also includes 224 KB of expansion memory as well.

Mindset has dual front-mounted ROM cartridge ports with a locking knob on the left side of the main computer module to lock the ROM modules into place. The Mindset has the option (through its System Configuration Utility) to be able to select whether the system boots from left or right ROM carts, or disk drive. Cartridges can also contain CMOS RAM, which is retained when unplugged by a battery in the cartridge case. Cartridges were envisioned to be a primary medium for software distribution on the Mindset, but sales of the system were too low for cartridges to be economical, and software was distributed on disk instead.

While released in 1984, models of the M1001 Mindset computer with BIOS ROM code 1.07 and earlier show a copyright notice of (c) 1983 Mindset Computer Corp.

===Sound processor===
Mindset has a custom sound-processor (CSP). The optional Sound Module adds a second CSP, along with a right channel audio output jack. There are four operating modes:
==Rear ports==
The rear of the computer is equipped with the following ports:

* Audio left
* Composite out
* TV/RF
* Channel 3/4 select switch
* RGB video
* EXT sync
* Aux in
* Aux out

The rear of the main computer module also has 3× 36-pin Expansion bus slots.

The Dual Disk/Memory Expansion Unit adds an additional three 36-pin Expansion bus slots to the system.

==Expansion modules==
* Dual Disk Drive / Memory Expansion Module. Some are marked Model # M1003 and others M1004, despite there being no internal or external differences.
* Printer Module – parallel
* RS-232-C Module – serial
* Modem Module 300
* Modem Module 1200
* 128 KB memory &quot;Cartridge Module&quot;
* Hard Drive System, consisting of an Interface &quot;Cartridge Module&quot; and HD loader on NVRAM cartridge
* Stereo Module – adds right channel output jack and second sound processor

==Peripherals==

* Mouse
* Analog joystick
* Touch Tablet
* Video Production Module – video fader

==Video game==
Only one video game has been released for the Mindset:
* &quot;Vyper&quot; (Synapse Software, 1984)

<text>The Legislative Council of Quebec (, ) was the unelected upper house of the bicameral legislature in the Canadian province of Quebec from 1867 to 1968. The Legislative Assembly was the elected lower house.

The council was composed of 24 members, appointed by the lieutenant governor upon the recommendation of the premier. Each councillor nominally represented a portion of the Province of Quebec called a division. The boundaries of these divisions were identical to the ones used for Canada East by the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada and were also identical to the boundaries still used today by the Senate of Canada for Quebec. The division boundaries were never changed to accommodate territorial expansions of Quebec in 1898 and 1912.

The Legislative Council was abolished in 1968 and the Legislative Assembly was renamed the National Assembly of Quebec. Since the abolition, Quebec has a unicameral legislature.

== Powers of the Legislative Council ==

The council had the right to introduce bills, except of a financial nature, and to amend or reject bills passed by the Legislative Assembly. Its speaker, known in French as orateur, was by right a member of the Cabinet, and its members could serve as ministers or even premier. Two Quebec premiers, Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville and John Jones Ross, were members of the Legislative Council.
== Appointment of members of the Legislative Council ==

Members were originally appointed for life. In 1963, the rule was changed to force members to retire at age 75, but that did not apply to members who had already been appointed. In the event, the change remained entirely theoretical since the council was abolished before it could be applied to anyone.

== Abolition of the Legislative Council ==

Effective December 31, 1968 the Legislative Council was abolished, and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec was renamed the National Assembly. As a consequence, Quebec now has a unicameral legislature. The establishment of the original system dates back to the Constitutional Act of 1791.

The Union Nationale government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand passed the legislation, known as &quot;Bill 90&quot;, to implement the change. Previous governments had made unsuccessful attempts to eliminate the upper chamber. In fact, the first attempt dated all the way back to Félix-Gabriel Marchand, in the late 19th century. Quebec was the last Canadian province to abolish its upper house.

When it was dissolved, it had 15 members of the Union Nationale and 9 Liberal Party members.

== The Red Chamber ==

The large chamber that housed the Legislative Council is also known in French as &quot;le salon rouge&quot; (the red hall) and in English as &quot;the Red Room&quot; because of the predominance of the colour on the walls. It is now used for committee meetings and for important state functions that require a large, impressive hall, such as inductions into the National Order of Quebec.

== Speakers of the Legislative Council of Quebec (1867–1968) ==

The Speaker of the Legislative Council (in French, the &quot;Orateur&quot;) was appointed by the government. Most Speakers sat in the Cabinet. The Speaker was the presiding officer of the Legislative Council, but could vote like other members. In the event of a tie, the Speaker did not have a casting vote. The motion simply failed.

== Legislative Council divisions ==

The twenty-four members of the Legislative Council were each appointed to represent a division of Quebec. The divisions were originally defined by statute for the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada in 1856, when elected members were included in the Legislative Council. The statutory descriptions of the divisions were then incorporated into the &quot;Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 1859&quot;. In 1867, the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; simply adopted the existing twenty-four divisions for the new Legislative Council of Quebec, although the new Council was appointed, rather than elected.

Although the boundaries of Quebec were extended northwards twice, in 1898 and again in 1912, the boundaries of the Legislative Council divisions were never altered.

<text>Tatiana Petrovna Nikolayeva (; May 4, 1924November 22, 1993) was a pianist, composer, and teacher from the Soviet Union.

==Life==
Nikolayeva was born in Bezhitsa, in the Bryansk district, on May 4, 1924. Her mother was a professional pianist and studied at the Moscow Conservatory under the renowned pedagogue Alexander Goldenweiser, and her father was an amateur violinist and cellist. Nikolayeva won first prize in the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition in Leipzig, which was founded to mark the bicentenary of Bach&#x27;s death in 1750. Dmitri Shostakovich, who was a member of the jury, composed and dedicated the 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 87, to her: it remained an important part of her piano repertoire.

She sat as a jury member on international competitions such as the Paloma O&#x27;Shea Santander International Piano Competition, the International Tchaikovsky Competition and the Leeds Piano Competition. She recorded her own transcription of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;. Nikolayeva was the teacher of Nikolai Lugansky. Among her other students were András Schiff, whom she taught in summer courses at the Hochschule für Musik Franz Liszt, Weimar, and Michael Korstick, whom she taught during her master classes at Musikhochschule Cologne, Germany.

She died on November 22, 1993, in San Francisco, nine days after succumbing to a brain haemorrhage during a performance of one of the Op. 87 fugues at the Herbst Theatre.

As James Campbell-Methuen commented in her obituary, &quot;Aside from the Shostakovich, though, Tatiana Nikolayeva will be remembered as a Bach player who flung stylistic considerations to the winds and played the music with an irrepressible musical intelligence and knowledge of the resources of her chosen instrument.&quot;

==Partial repertoire==

* 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 87 (Shostakovich)
* Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)

<doc id="517192" wikidata="Q12053618" url="?curid=517192" title="British Rail Class 52">
<text>The British Rail Class 52 is a class of 74 Type 4 diesel-hydraulic locomotives built for the Western Region of British Railways between 1961 and 1964. All were given two-word names, the first word being &quot;Western&quot; and thus the type became known as Westerns. They were also known as &quot;Wizzos&quot; and &quot;Thousands&quot;. The final Class 52 locomotives were withdrawn from service in 1977.

==Historical context==

When switching to diesel traction as part of the Modernisation Plan of the 1950s, British Railways (BR) designed, and commissioned designs for, a large number of locomotive types. At this time BR&#x27;s regions had a high degree of autonomy, which extended as far as classes of locomotives ordered and even the design criteria for those locomotives. Whilst almost all other diesel locomotives were diesel-electric, the Western Region employed a policy of using diesel-hydraulic traction, originally commissioning three classes of main line locomotives: a type 2 and two type 4s (later designations Class 22, Class 41 and Class 42). With pressure to increase the speed of the transition from steam to diesel, volume orders for the Class 22 and Class 42 (along with a similar design Class 43) followed in 1957, a mere two years after the original orders and well before any idea of performance or reliability could be gained. 

At the same time it was realised that all the existing orders (diesel-electric and diesel-hydraulic) were for types 1, 2 and 4; thus orders were placed for 101 Type 3 diesel-hydraulics (later Class 35). However the increasing demands for more powerful locomotives prompted a further order, in 1961, for 74 diesel-hydraulics of ; so when the first locomotive was outshopped from Swindon Works in December 1961, less than a year after the order was placed, the Westerns were born.

The theoretical advantage of diesel-hydraulic was simple: it resulted in a lighter locomotive than equivalent diesel-electric transmission. This provided a better power/weight ratio and decreased track wear. Unfortunately, it had several key disadvantages:

* The technology was proven in continental Europe, particularly Germany, but was new to the UK. At the time, it was considered politically unacceptable for the UK government to order railway rolling stock from foreign companies, especially German companies so soon after the Second World War. This resulted in most of the engines and transmissions being manufactured in the United Kingdom under licence from the German manufacturers.
* The most robust hydraulic transmissions were only capable of handling engines with power output of around 1,500 hp (1,120 kW); building a more powerful locomotive would involve two diesel engines and two transmissions.
* The transmission had significantly higher power losses than diesel-electric, negating some of the benefits and resulting in considerably higher fuel consumption.
Experience showed that the Bristol-Siddeley-Maybach engines were superior to those made by North British Locomotive Company-MAN and although the use of twin engines in the same locomotive was new, the design did not produce any insurmountable problems. In the end the diesel-hydraulic experiment foundered on low fleet numbers, poor maintenance conditions and design issues; not on its German heritage or development of a novel configuration. BR&#x27;s Swindon Works maintained all the diesel-hydraulic locomotives, and their early demise resulted in a much reduced workload and hastened its eventual closure in 1986.

== The Western ==

With the Hymeks and Warships already in service but proving underpowered for top-link services, BR Western Region needed a high-powered locomotive for these trains – the Western therefore needed two diesel engines to achieve the required power output. In keeping with their policy, a new locomotive with a hydraulic transmission was envisaged. Experience had shown that the Maybach engines in the Hymeks were superior to the earlier Maybach and MAN engines used in the Warships, particularly in power output. Also Maybach were able to offer their 12 MD engines rated at allied to a Voith transmission; a Mekydro transmission designed to handle such power could not be fitted into the British loading gauge.

Prototypes sited the engines behind the driving cabs but drivers found this too noisy; moving the engines centrally meant making the locomotive heavier, removing some of the design&#x27;s advantage. In operational use, the dual-engine arrangement turned out to have some advantages: in particular, the Westerns were able to continue operating with a single engine running in situations where more conventional single-engine designs would require rescue by another locomotive.

The most serious continual problem with the class was a mismatch between the Maybach MD655 engines and the Voith L630rV three speed hydraulic transmissions, a design fault. The top gear ratio in the transmission was too high for the torque characteristics of the engine: the result was that a single locomotive could struggle to reach its claimed top speed in the absence of down grades, more so when work-weary and due for overhaul. This factor, the South Devon Banks (a major part of their running grounds) and the deleterious effect on worn-out engines, all contributed against the Westerns continuing in top-line service. With fifty Class 50 locomotives becoming available following completion of the West Coast Main Line electrification, and new High Speed Trains, the speed and comfort increases the Western Region sought could be achieved and the Westerns dispensed with. Towards the end of their careers, the Westerns were all allocated to Laira (Plymouth).

== Competition and comfort ==

Whilst the design was largely successful, the working life of the class was relatively short. Its non-standard design added to its maintenance costs at a time when national British Rail policy was moving away from diesel-hydraulics. When the Westerns were introduced in 1962, the Western Region had 226 diesel-hydraulics and 10 diesel-electrics (excluding shunters); by 1966, the numbers were 345 and 269 respectively. As a result, the early 1970s saw the decision taken to retire all the diesel-hydraulic types. Class 46s and Class 47s took over passengers and heavy freight, Class 31s and Class 37s took over light passengers and freight, and Class 25s covered the lighter duties. Following completion of the electrification of the West Coast Main Line throughout from London to Glasgow, the Class 50s were reallocated to the Western Region; the introduction of High Speed Trains three years later was the final nail in the coffin for the Class 52 Westerns.

In 1968–69, the Westerns received train air brake equipment in addition to their vacuum exhausters, thus significantly extending their working lives, unlike the similar but lower-powered, Warship class. Four of the class (D1017–D1020) did not receive dual brakes, with these locomotives being among the first withdrawals. The vacuum brake equipment was retained and to fit the additional equipment, it was necessary to remove one of the fuel tanks. However, as with the Warships, it proved impossible to equip them with electric train heating (ETH, or head-end power in US terminology). The Western Region faced particularly stiff competition for its prime inter-city services in the mid to late 1970s from the M4 motorway and it was generally felt within BR that significant speed and comfort improvements on the prime London Paddington-Bristol route were necessary. The lack of ETH meant the Westerns could not power the newly introduced air-conditioned BR Mark 2d/e/f coaches – a shortcoming that classes 47 and 50, equipped with ETH (the latter from new), did not share.

== Performance ==
The highest recorded speed with a Western that O. S. Nock was aware of was when D1068 hauled nine coaches (305 tons gross) down 1 in 1,320 (i.e. virtually level) at Southall. The train averaged exactly for between Slough and Ealing whilst hauling a service from Reading to Paddington.

However, when it came to drawbar horsepower the Westerns in some respects were less capable than the equivalent diesel electric locomotives. Nock states &quot;whilst the Westerns took their rightful place as fast and powerful locomotives it became evident that they were showing the same deficiency in actual power put forth at the drawbar as the [diesel-hydraulic] Warships had done. The highest output that came to my notice was a sustained hauling 560 tons descending 1 in 1,320, which equates to 1,500 edhp (equivalent drawbar horsepower)&quot;. A similar result was obtained when Clough &amp; Beckett compared the performance of type 4 diesel locomotives (Classes 45/46/47/50/52) hauling trains up the ascent to Whiteball summit. They deliberately chose data to show each class in their best light and included a Western run which produced 1,775 edhp but they still concluded that &quot;without doubt the Westerns get the wooden spoon; certainly not what one would expect from units of 2,700 bhp&quot;. The best performer was the Class 50, a diesel-electric locomotive: on one run this achieved 2,115 edhp.

Despite this apparent limitation, the BR Western Region load-limit book gave the same 550 ton loading figure for both the Class 52 and Class 47 diesels over the South Devon banks between Newton Abbot and Plymouth. The reason for this is that, while the diesel-electric classes could produce high maximum tractive effort for limited periods, diesel hydraulics could produce significantly higher continuous tractive effort.

== Fleet list ==
While the first Western was under construction, proposals for livery and names were prepared by the BR design panel. The D1000 series locomotives were to be named after famous West of England place names; the illustration from the portfolio shows D1000 bearing the name &quot;Cheddar Gorge&quot;. This was not followed in production, however, and the Westerns were named with general heraldic and regimental terms prefixed with the word &quot;Western&quot; as per the following table.

Of the 74 locomotives built, 7 have survived to preservation.

Although designated Class 52 under the TOPS scheme and all were still in service when TOPS was introduced in 1973, no Western ever carried its &quot;52 0xx&quot; TOPS number. As withdrawal was already planned when the scheme was introduced and because of the cast number plates, it was not considered cost effective to renumber the locomotives. Some class members did run with the &quot;D&quot; of their number painted over – TOPS classification removed the need for locomotives to indicate their energy type in the running number (D = Diesel, E = Electric).

When the display of destination headcodes on the front of trains was dropped in 1976, the instruction was given for them all to be set to &quot;0000&quot;. On many Westerns, the headcode was set to display the locomotive&#x27;s number in contravention of this directive and most surviving members of the class ran like this until they were scrapped. If used for routing, such reporting numbers would be interpreted as a passenger express terminating on the Southern Region.

== Liveries ==

===Early liveries===

When the initial batch of Westerns was being built in 1961–2, British Rail was considering a new unified corporate colour scheme but had not yet made a final decision on what it would be. As a result, some of the early locomotives were painted in experimental liveries: D1000 was rolled out of Swindon Works in November 1961 painted in a light brown livery which became known as Desert Sand. Initially the numbers, borne on the left hand cab when viewed from the side, were painted in white but soon individual numbers and letters, looking like they were cast but apparently made of wood, were fitted. This was in turn replaced by the final design of cast nameplate and numberplate; metal with a black background. This livery was later altered by the addition of a small yellow warning panel at each end and a black roof. 

The second locomotive, D1001 was delivered in an all-over maroon livery with yellow buffer beams and further locomotives D1002-D1004 in all-over green with small yellow warning panels. Remaining deliveries carried the all-over maroon livery, initially without yellow warning panels, but the latter were applied from new after D1010 of the Swindon-built, and D1043 of the Crewe-built locomotives. Exceptions were the first four locomotives built at Crewe, D1035–D1038, which were delivered in green livery with red backgrounds to the nameplates, and D1015, which was outshopped from Swindon in an experimental &quot;golden ochre&quot; livery with small yellow warning panels at each end. On one end of this locomotive, the yellow panel was embellished by the addition of a yellow band which extended sideways from each of the top corners round onto the cabside for a short distance, resembling a T shape. The locomotive is not believed to have run in this condition, but was released to traffic in the golden ochre livery with standard small yellow panels.

===Corporate scheme===

After the adoption of Rail Blue with full yellow ends in 1966 (D1048 was the first of the class painted in this livery in 1966), for some unexplained reason a small batch of locomotives (D1017, D1030, D1036, D1037, D1043, D1047 and D1057) received this variant married to small yellow warning panels; D1030 carried red buffer beams for a short while. All other repaints were with full yellow ends which extended from the body line above the buffer beam up to the base of the window frames, along the sill of the cab-side windows onto the vertical end reveal. The valance above the cab windows on the front was also painted yellow, leaving the window frames in their base aluminium. The drive to repaint the locomotives in Rail Blue was outstripped by the safety directive dictating full yellow ends for all powered vehicles and some locomotives ran for a time with their original maroon bodies and full yellow ends.

The last locomotive to be repainted into Rail Blue was D1046, outshopped from Swindon in May 1971. Some early photographs of the blue livery give it a more metallic shade which is even more evident on the locomotives with small yellow panels. This however is possibly a photographic anomaly with colour film or due to printing techniques.

It is commonly accepted amongst Western enthusiasts in recent years that none of the class or any other British Rail locomotive of the period were ever painted with a metallic paint. However, several publications refer to initial painting in blue as being &quot;chromatic blue&quot; and published images do show a metallic sheen and lighter shade of blue than the standard Rail Blue.

== Incidents ==

* 15 August 1963. Knowle and Dorridge rail crash. D1040 &quot;Western Queen&quot; collided with a freight train, crushing the cab and killing the three traincrew. The locomotive was repaired and returned to service.
* 11 January 1967. St Annes Bristol rail crash. No. 1071 &quot;Western Renown&quot; in charge of the diverted 12:00 Paddington to Swansea collided with the rear of the 11:45 Paddington to Bristol hauled by No. 1067 &quot;Western Druid&quot;. The collision resulted in very severe damage being caused to the leading cab of locomotive No. 1071, but the three men in the cab escaped injury by moving into the centre of the locomotive. Nineteen passengers required first aid or medical treatment but there were no fatalities or serious injuries. The locomotive was repaired and returned to service.
* 19 December 1973. Ealing rail crash. No. 1007 &quot;Western Talisman&quot; derailed while hauling an express passenger train, after an unlocked battery box door fell open, broke off and changed points under the locomotive. Ten people were killed. The locomotive did not return to service.
* 29 January 1975 (Oxford). No. 1023 &quot;Western Fusilier&quot; derailed with a London Paddington to Birmingham train whilst approaching the platform. This was due to a failed axle which had split due to the growth of a previously undetected crack. There were no reported injuries and the locomotive was later preserved.
* 3 January 1976 (Worcester Tunnel). No. 1055 &quot;Western Advocate&quot; crashed into a stationary parcels train killing the driver and guard of the Western. The locomotive did not return to service.

== Withdrawal ==
Withdrawal of the class began in May 1973 with D1019 &quot;Western Challenger&quot; and D1032 &quot;Western Marksman&quot; becoming the first members of the class to be withdrawn. The final five engines in service were withdrawn in February 1977, these five engines would also survive into preservation with D1023 being donated to the National Collection.

== Preservation ==
Seven locomotives have survived into preservation at heritage railways, four Swindon built &amp; three Crewe built. Two have run on the mainline in preservation with D1015 being passed to operate on the mainline since 2002. D1062 made a brief appearance in 1980 during the Rocket 150 parade at Rainhill.

D1022 &quot;Western Sentinel&quot; was a candidate for preservation and was planned to be purchased by the DTG (Diesel Traction Group), but it was scrapped. D1015 &quot;Western Champion&quot; was purchased for preservation.


== Model railways ==
The first model of a Class 52 was produced by Trix to its unusual compromise scale of 3.8mm to 1ft with OO gauge/HO gauge (16.5mm) track. This model, however, was quite crude.

In 1979 Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 52 (type 4) Western in OO gauge.

Lima also produced a model to OO gauge.

A British N gauge model was produced by Graham Farish.

Since then, OO gauge models have been produced by both Heljan, and most recently Dapol, whilst an O gauge model has been produced by Heljan. Dapol have also produced a model in British N gauge. The Dapol models were produced from a 3D scan of D1015 &quot;Western Champion&quot; at Tyseley Locomotive Works in February 2011.

<doc id="517195" wikidata="Q346280" url="?curid=517195" title="Alan Ladd">
<text>Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913 – January 29, 1964) was an American actor and film producer. Ladd found success in film in the 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in films noir and Westerns. He was often paired with Veronica Lake in films noir, such as &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; (1942), &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946). &quot;Whispering Smith&quot; (1948) was his first Western and color film, and &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) was noted for its contributions to the genre. Ladd also appeared in ten films with William Bendix.

His other notable credits include &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1949). His popularity diminished in the mid-1950s, though he continued to appear in numerous films, including his first supporting role since &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; in the smash hit &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; released in 1964.

==Biography==
Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on September 3, 1913. He was the only child of Ina Raleigh (also known as Selina Rowley) (1888–1937), and Alan Ladd (1874–1917), a freelance accountant. His mother was English, from County Durham, and had migrated to the U.S. in 1907 when she was 19. His father died of a heart attack when Ladd was four. On July 3, 1918, young Alan accidentally burned down the family home while playing with matches. His mother moved to Oklahoma City, where she married Jim Beavers, a house painter (d. 1936).

In the early 1920s an economic downturn led to Ladd&#x27;s family moving to California, which took four months. They lived in a migrant camp in Pasadena, California, at first and then moved to the San Fernando Valley, where Beavers went to work at FBO Studios as a painter.

Ladd enrolled in North Hollywood High School on February 18, 1930. He became a high-school swimming and diving champion and participated in high school dramatics in his senior year, including the role of Ko-Ko in &quot;The Mikado&quot;. His diving skills led to his appearance in the aquatic show &quot;Marinella&quot; in July 1933.

===Early career===
Ladd&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Mikado&quot; was seen by a talent scout. In August 1933 Ladd was one of a group of young &quot;discoveries&quot; signed to a long-term contract with Universal Pictures. The contract had options that could continue for seven years, but they were all in the studio&#x27;s favor. Ladd appeared unbilled in &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (1932), but the studio eventually decided Ladd was too blond and too short, and it dropped him after six months. (All of Ladd&#x27;s fellow &quot;discoveries&quot; eventually were dropped, including a young Tyrone Power.)

At 20, Ladd graduated from high school on February 1, 1934. He worked in the advertising department of the &quot;San Fernando Sun Valley Record&quot;, becoming the newspaper&#x27;s advertising manager. When the paper changed hands, Ladd lost his job. He sold cash registers and borrowed $150 to open his own hamburger and malt shop, across from his previous high school, which he called Tiny&#x27;s Patio (his nickname at high school was Tiny), but he was unable to make a success of the shop.

In another attempt to break into the film industry, Ladd went to work at Warner Bros. as a grip and stayed two years. He was injured falling off a scaffold and decided to quit.

Ladd managed to save and borrow enough money to attend an acting school run by Ben Bard, who had taught him when he was under contract at Universal. Ladd appeared in several stage productions for Bard. Bard later claimed Ladd &quot;was such a shy guy he just wouldn&#x27;t speak up loud and strong. I had to get him to lower his voice too; it was too high. I also insisted that he get himself a decent set of dentures.&quot;

In 1936, Ladd played an unbilled role in &quot;Pigskin Parade&quot;. He had short-term stints at MGM and RKO and got regular professional acting work only when he turned to radio. Ladd had worked to develop a rich, deep voice ideal for that medium, and in 1936 he was signed by station KFWB as its sole radio actor. He stayed for three years at KFWB, working as many as 20 shows per week.

===Earning an agent===
One night Ladd was playing the roles of a father and son on radio when he was heard by the agent Sue Carol. She was impressed and called the station to talk to the actors and was told it was one person. She arranged to meet him and, impressed by his looks, she signed him to her books and enthusiastically promoted her new client in films as well as on radio. Ladd&#x27;s first notable part under Carol&#x27;s management was the 1939 film &quot;Rulers of the Sea&quot;, in which he played a character named Colin Farrell, at $250 per week. He also received attention for a small part in &quot;Hitler – Beast of Berlin&quot; (1939).

Ladd tested unsuccessfully for the lead in &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1939) but obtained many other small roles in films such as the serial &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1940), &quot;Her First Romance&quot; (1940), &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1941), and the Disney film &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; (1941). Most notably, he had a small uncredited part in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, playing a newspaper reporter toward the end of the film.

Ladd&#x27;s career gained extra momentum when he was cast in a featured role in &quot;Joan of Paris&quot; (1942), a wartime drama made at RKO. It was only a small part, but it involved a touching death scene that brought him attention within the industry. RKO eventually offered Ladd a contract at $400 per week. However, he soon received a better offer from Paramount.

===&quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; and stardom===

Paramount had owned the film rights to &quot;A Gun for Sale&quot;, a novel by Graham Greene, since 1936 but waited until 1941 before making a movie out of it, changing the title to &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;. Director Frank Tuttle was struggling to find a new actor to play the role of Raven, a hit man with a conscience. Ladd auditioned successfully, and Paramount signed him to a long-term contract in September 1941 for $300 per week. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that:

Tuttle and the studio are showing more than a passing enthusiasm for Ladd. He has been trying to get a foothold in pictures for eight years, but received no encouragement, although he tried every angle known to town—extra work, bit parts, stock contracts, dramatic schools, assault of the casting offices. Sue Carol, the former silent star who is now an agent, undertook to advance the youth&#x27;s career two years ago, and only recently could she locate an attentive ear. Then, the breaks began.

According to author David Thomson (film critic) in 1975, &quot;Once Ladd had acquired an unsmiling hardness, he was transformed from an extra to a phenomenon. Ladd&#x27;s calm slender ferocity make it clear that he was the first American actor to show the killer as a cold angel.&quot; John Houseman later wrote that Ladd played &quot;a professional killer with a poignant and desolate ferocity that made him unique, for a time, among the male heroes of his day.&quot;

Both the film and Ladd&#x27;s performance played an important role in the development of the gangster genre: &quot;That the old-fashioned motion picture gangster with his ugly face, gaudy cars, and flashy clothes was replaced by a smoother, better looking, and better dressed bad man was largely the work of Mr. Ladd.&quot; – &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary (January 30, 1964).

Though the romantic lead went to established star Robert Preston, Ladd&#x27;s teaming in support with female lead Veronica Lake captured the public&#x27;s imagination. Their overnight sensation pairing continued in three more films and included three more in guest spots in wartime all-star Hollywood musical revues.

===&quot;The Glass Key&quot;===

Even during the filming of &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;, Paramount knew it had a potential star and announced Ladd&#x27;s next film, an adaptation of Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s story, &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942). This had been a successful vehicle for George Raft several years earlier, and Paramount wanted &quot;a sure-fire narrative to carry him on his way.&quot; There had also been talk Ladd would appear in &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, another story by Hammett, but this was never produced.

The movie was Ladd&#x27;s second pairing with Lake, with Ladd offering confident support of Brian Donlevy—so confident he even ended up with Donlevy&#x27;s girl. Ladd&#x27;s cool, unsmiling, understated persona proved popular with wartime audiences, and he was voted by the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; as one of the 10 &quot;stars of tomorrow&quot; for 1942. His salary was raised to $750 per week. According to critic David Shipman:
Paramount of course was delighted. The majority of stars were earmarked as such when they appeared on the horizon—from Broadway or from wherever they came; if it seemed unlikely that public acceptance would come with one film they were trained and built up: The incubation period was usually between two and five years. As far as Ladd was concerned, he was a small-part actor given a fat part &quot;faute de mieux&quot;, and after his second film for them, he had not merely hit the leading-men category, but had gone beyond it to films which were constructed around his personality.

Ladd then appeared in &quot;Lucky Jordan&quot; (1943), a lighter vehicle with Helen Walker, playing a gangster who tries to get out of war service and tangles with Nazis. His new status was reflected by the fact he was the only actor billed above the title. He had a cameo spoofing his tough guy image in &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot;, which featured most of Paramount&#x27;s stars, and then starred in &quot;China&quot; (1943) with Loretta Young for director John Farrow, with whom Ladd made a number of movies. Young did not like working with Ladd:

I found him petulant... I don&#x27;t remember hearing him laugh, or ever seeing him laugh. Everything that concerned him was very serious... He had a certain screen personality... but as an actor... I never made any contact with him. He wouldn&#x27;t look at me. He&#x27;d say &quot;I love you...&quot;, and he&#x27;d be looking out there some place. Finally, I said &quot;Alan, I&#x27;m he-ere!!&quot;... I think he was very conscious of his looks. Alan would not look beyond a certain point in the camera because he didn&#x27;t think he looked good... Jimmy Cagney was not tall but somehow Jimmy was at terms with himself, always. I don&#x27;t think Alan Ladd ever came to terms with himself.
Ladd&#x27;s next film was meant to be &quot;Incendiary Blonde&quot;, opposite Betty Hutton, but he was inducted into the army on January 18, after reprising his performance in &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; on radio for &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;.

===Army service===
Ladd briefly served in the U.S. Army Air Forces&#x27; First Motion Picture Unit. Initially, he was classified 4-Funfit for military service because of stomach problemsbut he later enlisted for military service on January 19, 1943. He was posted to the Walla Walla Army Air Base at Walla Walla, Washington, attaining the rank of corporal. He attended the Oscars in March 1943, and in September he appeared in a trailer promoting a war loan drive titled &quot;Letter from a Friend&quot;.

While Ladd was in the armed services, a number of films that had been announced for him were postponed and/or made with different actors, including &quot;Incendiary Blonde&quot;, &quot;The Story of Dr. Wassell&quot;, &quot;Ministry of Fear&quot;, and &quot;The Man in Half Moon Street&quot;. Paramount started promoting Ladd replacements, such as Sonny Tufts and Barry Sullivan. Old Ladd films were reissued with his being given more prominent billing, such as &quot;Hitler, Beast of Berlin&quot;. He was reportedly receiving 20,000 fan letters per week. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Ladd in the brief period of a year and with only four starring pictures to his credit... had built up a following unmatched in film history since Rudolph Valentino skyrocketed to fame.&quot; In December 1943, he was listed as the 15th most popular star in the U.S.

Ladd fell ill and went to the military hospital in Santa Barbara for several weeks in October. On October 28, he was given an honorable medical discharge because of a stomach disorder complicated by influenza.

===Return to filmmaking===
When Ladd returned from the army, Paramount announced a series of vehicles for him, including &quot;And Now Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;. &quot;And Now Tomorrow&quot; was a melodrama, starring Loretta Young as a wealthy deaf woman who is treated (and loved) by her doctor, played by Ladd; Raymond Chandler co-wrote the screenplay, and it was filmed in late 1943 and early 1944. According to Shipman:
It was a pitch to sell Ladd to women filmgoers, though he had not changed one iota and he did not have a noticeable romantic aura. But Paramount hoped that women might feel that beneath the rock-like expression there smouldered fires of passion, or something like. His black-lashed eyes, however, gave nothing away; it was &#x27;take me as I am&#x27; or &#x27;I&#x27;m the boss around here&#x27;. He never flirted nor even seemed interested (which is one of the reasons he and Lake were so effective together).
In March 1944, Ladd took another physical and was reclassified 1A. He would have to be reinducted into the army, but a deferment was given to enable Ladd to make &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (the release of which was postponed two years). He was meant to be re-inducted on September 4, 1944, but Paramount succeeded in getting this pushed back again to make &quot;Salty O&#x27;Rourke&quot;. He also found time to make a cameo in a big-screen version of &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;.

Ladd&#x27;s reinduction was then set for May 1945. Paramount commissioned Raymond Chandler to write an original screenplay for him titled &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot;, made relatively quickly in case the studio lost Ladd to the military once again. However, in May 1945, the U.S. Army released all men 30 or over from induction, and Ladd was finally free from the draft. Along with several other film stars likewise spared, Ladd promptly enlisted with the Hollywood Victory Committee for the entertainment industry&#x27;s overseas arm, volunteering to tour for USO shows.

Ladd next made &quot;Calcutta&quot; (1947), which reteamed him with John Farrow and William Bendix. Release for this film was delayed.

===Suspension===
Ladd was meant to make &quot;California&quot; with Betty Hutton, but he refused to report for work in August 1945. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t on account of the picture&quot;, said Ladd. &quot;There were other issues.&quot; Ladd wanted more money, and Paramount responded by suspending him. The two parties reconciled in November with Ladd&#x27;s getting a salary increase to $75,000 per film, but without story approval or the right to do outside films, which he had wanted. Exhibitors voted him the 15th-most popular star in the country.

&quot;When a star&#x27;s off the screen, he&#x27;s &#x27;dead&#x27;&quot;, Ladd later reflected. &quot;I like my home and my security and I don&#x27;t intend to jeopardize them by being difficult at work.&quot;

Ladd&#x27;s next film was &quot;O.S.S&quot;, a wartime thriller, produced by Richard Maibaum. He then convinced Ladd that he should play the title role in an adaptation of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, to which Paramount held the film rights; Ladd became enthusiastic at the chance to change his image, but the project was delayed by a combination of censorship wrangles and studio reluctance.

Eventually, &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; was released to great acclaim (Raymond Chandler was nominated for an Oscar for the screenplay), quickly followed by &quot;O.S.S.&quot;, and finally, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;. The first two films were solid hits, each earning over $2 million in rentals in the U.S. and Canada; &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; was a blockbuster, earning over $4 million and ranking among the top 10 most popular films of the year. Ladd&#x27;s roles in &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;, &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, and &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot;, firmly established him as a no-nonsense tough guy in a popular genre of crime films later to become known as film noir.

Ladd earned a reported $88,909 for the 12 months up to June 1946. (The following year, he earned $107,000.) In 1947, he was ranked among the top 10 popular stars in the U.S. That year finally had the release of &quot;Calcutta&quot;, along with &quot;Wild Harvest&quot;, where he reteamed with Robert Preston.

Ladd made a cameo appearance as a detective in the Bob Hope comedy, &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot; (1947), and he made another cameo in an all-star Paramount film, titled, &quot;Variety Girl&quot;, singing Frank Loesser&#x27;s &quot;Tallahassee&quot; with Dorothy Lamour. He was reteamed with Lake for the final time in &quot;Saigon&quot; (1948), then made &quot;Whispering Smith&quot; (1948), his first Western since he became a star (and his first movie in color). He followed this with &quot;Beyond Glory&quot; (1948), a melodrama with Farrow, which featured Audie Murphy in his film debut (and was released before &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;).

=== Radio and comic books ===
Since he had become a star, Ladd continued to appear in radio, usually in dramatizations of feature films for such shows as &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; and &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;. He created roles played both by himself, but also other actors, including the part of Rick Blaine in an adaptation of &quot;Casablanca&quot;. In 1948, he starred and produced &quot;Box 13&quot;, a regular weekly series for syndication, which ran for 52 episodes.

From 1949–1951, he appeared in a nine-issue series of comic books published by DC Comics, portraying Ladd in a variety of adventurous situations; the first six issues had photos of him on the covers.

===&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;===
Ladd&#x27;s next role was a significant change of pace, playing Jay Gatsby in the 1949 version of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, written and produced by Richard Maibaum. This film had been planned since 1946, but production was delayed due to a combination of difficulties with the censor, and Paramount&#x27;s reluctance for Ladd to play such a challenging part. It was not a big success at the box office, and its mixed critical and commercial reception caused Ladd to avoid serious dramatic roles.

His next films were standard fare: &quot;Chicago Deadline&quot;, playing a tough reporter; &quot;Captain Carey, U.S.A.&quot;, as a vengeful ex-OSS agent, for Maibaum; and &quot;Appointment with Danger&quot;, as a postal inspector investigating a murder with the help of nun Phyllis Calvert (shot in 1949, but not released until 1951).

Paramount purchased the screen rights to the play &quot;Detective Story&quot; as a possible vehicle for Ladd, and he was keen to do it, but the role went to Kirk Douglas. Ladd was cast, instead, in &quot;Branded&quot;, a Western. In February 1950, Paramount announced that Ladd would star in a film version of the novel &quot;Shane&quot;. Before he made this film, he appeared in &quot;Red Mountain&quot;, produced by Hal Wallis.

In 1950, the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Press Club voted Ladd the easiest male star to deal with in Hollywood. The following year, a poll from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association listed Ladd as the second most popular male film star in the world, after Gregory Peck.

===&quot;Shane&quot;===

In 1951, Ladd&#x27;s contract had only one more year to run. &quot;Paramount is like a home to me&quot;, he said, &quot;and I&#x27;d like to remain on the lot for one picture a year. But I want to be free to take pictures at other studios if offered to me.&quot; The main studio Ladd was in discussion with was Warner Bros. He also received a six-year offer to make &quot;Adventure Limited&quot;, a TV series.

In May 1951, Ladd announced he had formed Ladd Enterprises, his own production company, to produce films, radio, and TV, when his Paramount contract ended in November 1952. He optioned the novel &quot;Shadow Riders of the Yellowstone&quot; by Les Savage. The next month, his deal with Warner Bros. was announced: one film per year for five years. However, he expressed a desire to continue to work with Paramount.

Ladd&#x27;s final three movies for Paramount were &quot;Thunder in the East&quot;, &quot;Shane&quot;, and &quot;Botany Bay&quot;. Once Ladd finished &quot;Botany Bay&quot; in February 1952, it was announced Ladd&#x27;s contract with Paramount would end early and be amended, so that he would make two more movies for the studio, at a later date. (In the end, Ladd did not make another film at Paramount until &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;.)

Paramount staggered the release of Ladd&#x27;s final films for the company, with &quot;Shane&quot; and &quot;Botany Bay&quot; not being released until 1953. Ladd later said that leaving Paramount was &quot;a big upset&quot; for him and that he only left for &quot;business reasons...future security for the children and ourselves&quot;.

&quot;Shane&quot;, in which he played a strong, silent, courageous title character, was particularly popular. It premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City in April 1953, grossing over $114,000 in its four weeks there (a large sum at the time), and earning $8 million in North America over its initial run. This led to Ladd&#x27;s being voted one of the 10 most popular stars in the U.S. in 1953.

===Freelance star: Warner Bros., Universal, Warwick===

Ladd&#x27;s deal with Warner Bros. was for one film per year for 10 years, starting from when his contract with Paramount expired. Warner guaranteed him $150,000 per film against 10% of the gross, making Ladd one of the better paid stars in Hollywood. His first film for Warner Bros. was &quot;The Iron Mistress&quot; (1952), in which Ladd played Jim Bowie.

The arrangement with Warner was not exclusive, enabling Ladd to work for other studios. He made &quot;Desert Legion&quot;, a film at Universal Studios (1953), playing a member of the French Foreign Legion. Ladd was paid a fee and a percentage of the profits.

Ladd signed an arrangement with Warwick Films to make three films in Britain, where the actor was very popular: a wartime saga titled &quot;The Red Beret&quot; (1953), with Ladd masquerading as a Canadian soldier in the Parachute Regiment, and a whaling story titled &quot;Hell Below Zero&quot; (1954), based on the Hammond Innes book &quot;The White South&quot;. Both movies were co-written by Richard Maibaum, with whom Ladd had worked at Paramount. Ladd played a mountie in &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; for Universal in Canada and returned to Britain for his final film with Warwick, &quot;The Black Knight&quot; (1954), a medieval swashbuckler (a genre then in vogue), wherein Ladd played the title role. This meant Ladd spent 19 months out of the U.S. and did not have to pay tax on his income for this period. It also caused his plans to enter independent production to be deferred. Ladd&#x27;s fee for his Warwick films was $200,000 against 10% of the profits, plus living expenses.

===Jaguar Productions===
When Ladd returned to Hollywood in 1954, he formed Jaguar Productions, a new production company that released movies through Warner Bros. This was in addition to the films he made with Warner, solely as an actor.

His first film for Jaguar was &quot;Drum Beat&quot; (1954), a Western directed by Delmer Daves, which was reasonably successful at the box office. For Warners, he then made &quot;The McConnell Story&quot; (1955), co-starring June Allyson, which also proved popular. He signed to appear in some episodes of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; on TV. The first of these, &quot;Committed&quot;, was based on an old episode of &quot;Box 13&quot;, which Ladd was considering turning into a TV series. However, despite Ladd&#x27;s presence, a series did not result.

Ladd next made &quot;Hell on Frisco Bay&quot; (1955), a film for Jaguar also starring second-billed Edward G. Robinson and Joanne Dru, co-written by Martin Rackin and directed by Frank Tuttle, his old &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; associate. Rackin wrote and produced Ladd&#x27;s subsequent film, titled &quot;Santiago&quot;, which he made for Warner Bros. For Jaguar, Ladd produced, but did not appear in, &quot;A Cry in the Night&quot;.

Ladd&#x27;s instinct for choosing material was proving increasingly poor: George Stevens offered him the role of Jett Rink in &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), which he turned down because it was not the lead; James Dean took the part, and the film became one of the big hits of the decade. He was meant to return to Paramount to make &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot;, but he bought himself out of his Paramount contract for $135,000; the film was made a decade later, with John Wayne and Dean Martin, and was a big hit.

Instead, Ladd signed a new four-year contract between Jaguar and Warner Bros., with his company having a budget of $6.5 million. The first film made under it was &quot;The Big Land&quot; (1957), a Western. He made &quot;Farewell to Kennedy&quot;, another TV film for &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;; he hoped this would lead to a series, but that did not happen.

Ladd then received an offer to star in &quot;Boy on a Dolphin&quot; (1957), a film being made in Greece for 20th Century Fox. In March 1957, it was announced that WarnerBros. and Jaguar had renegotiated their agreement and that Jaguar would now make 10 films for the studio, of which Ladd was to appear in at least six, starting with &quot;The Deep Six&quot; (1958). Warner Bros. provided all the financing and split profits with Jaguar 50/50. The second film under the contract was &quot;Island of Lost Women&quot;, which Ladd produced but did not appear in.

Ladd&#x27;s next film as an actor saw him co-star with his son David in &quot;The Proud Rebel&quot;, made independently for Samuel Goldwyn Jr. According to Shipman, Ladd&#x27;s &quot;performance is his best work, sincere and likable (due perhaps to an odd resemblance in long shot to Buster Keaton), but the film did not have the success it deserved; Ladd&#x27;s own fans missed the bang-bang and [co star] Olivia de Havilland&#x27;s fans were not persuaded that any film she did with Ladd could be that good.&quot; He announced a six-picture deal with Warwick Productions but ultimately did not work for Warwick again. MGM hired Ladd to make &quot;The Badlanders&quot;, a Western remake of &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;, but like many of Ladd&#x27;s films around this time it was a box-office disappointment.

Ladd was considered to play the lead in &quot;The Angry Hills&quot;, but Robert Mitchum eventually was cast. Mitchum later told a journalist that the producers met Ladd at his home after &quot;he&#x27;d just crawled out of his swimming pool and was all shrunken up like a dishwasher&#x27;s hand. They decided he wouldn&#x27;t do for the big war correspondent.&quot;

===Later films===
For Walter Mirisch at United Artists, Ladd appeared in &quot;The Man in the Net&quot;. He produced a pilot for a TV series, starring William Bendix, called &quot;Ivy League&quot;. That did not go to series; neither did &quot;The Third Platoon&quot;, another pilot Ladd produced for Paramount, written by a young Aaron Spelling where Ladd only did a voiceover. Spelling also wrote &quot;Guns of the Timberland&quot; for Jaguar and Warners, in which Ladd appeared; it was his last movie for Warners.

As an actor, he made &quot;All the Young Men&quot; with Sidney Poitier, that was released through Columbia. &quot;One Foot in Hell&quot; (1960), over at 20th Century Fox, had Ladd play an out-and-out villain for the first time, since the beginning of his career, but the result was not popular with audiences.

&quot;I&#x27;d like to retire from acting&quot;, he said in 1960. &quot;I&#x27;d produce.&quot; Ladd kept busy developing projects, some of which were vehicles for his son, David.

Ladd also kept acting, following the path of many Hollywood stars made &quot;Duel of Champions&quot; (1961), a peplum in Italy. Back in Hollywood, he made &quot;13 West Street&quot;, as a star and producer, for Ladd Enterprises.

&quot;I&#x27;ll go to work again when the right story comes along&quot;, said Ladd. He joined the board of 38 Inc., a new film producing company, which announced plans to make a movie out of a Ben Hecht script.

In 1963, Ladd&#x27;s career looked set to make a comeback, when he took a supporting role in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, based on the best-selling novel. This was a co-production between Embassy and Paramount, meaning Ladd was filming on the Paramount back lot for the first time in over a decade. He also announced plans to turn &quot;Box 13&quot; into a feature-film script, and was hoping for cameos from old friends, such as Veronica Lake and William Bendix.

==Personal life==
On November 29, 1937, Ladd&#x27;s mother, who was staying with him following the breakup of a relationship, asked Ladd for some money to buy something at a local store. Ladd gave her the money, thinking it was for alcohol. She purchased some arsenic-based ant paste from a grocer and died by suicide by drinking it in the back seat of Ladd&#x27;s car.

On November 2, 1962, Ladd was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood with a bullet wound near his heart. The bullet penetrated Ladd&#x27;s chest around the third and fourth rib, through the lungs, and bounced off the rib cage. At the time, Ladd said he thought he heard a prowler, grabbed a gun, and tripped over, accidentally shooting himself. This was accepted by the police investigating.

Ladd has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1601 Vine Street. His handprint appears in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. In 1995, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

===Family and relationships===
Ladd married Marjorie Jane &quot;Midge&quot; Harrold, a high school sweetheart, in October 1936. Their only child, Alan Ladd, Jr., was born on October 22, 1937. They divorced in July 1941 and she died in 1957, having remarried.

On March 15, 1942, Ladd married his agent and manager, former film actress Sue Carol in Mexico City. They intended to be remarried in the U.S. in July because Ladd&#x27;s divorce from his first wife was not final. Carol had a daughter from a previous marriage, Carol Lee (b. July 18, 1932), whom Alan and Sue raised. In addition, they had two children of their own, Alana (born April 21, 1943, when Ladd was in the army) and David Ladd (1947).

Alan Ladd, Jr., was a film executive and producer and founder of the Ladd Company. Actress Alana Ladd, who co-starred with her father in &quot;Guns of the Timberland&quot; and &quot;Duel of Champions&quot;, was married to the veteran talk radio broadcaster Michael Jackson. Alana died on November 23, 2014. Actor David Ladd, who co-starred with his father as a child in &quot;The Proud Rebel&quot;, was married (1973–1980) to &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; star Cheryl Ladd (née Stoppelmoor). Their daughter is actress Jordan Ladd.

Ladd&#x27;s name was linked romantically with June Allyson when they made &quot;The McConnell Story&quot; together.

===Height===
Reports of Ladd&#x27;s height vary from to , with being cited most often in unofficial sources. His 1940 draft registration lists him as . His 1943 U.S. Army enlistment record, generally deemed to be the most reliable source, lists him as .

Ladd and Veronica Lake became a particularly popular pairing because, at , she was one of the few Hollywood actresses substantially shorter than he was. In his memoirs, actor/producer John Houseman wrote of Ladd: &quot;Since he himself was extremely short, he had only one standard by which he judged his fellow players: their height.&quot; To compensate for Ladd&#x27;s height, during the filming of &quot;Boy on a Dolphin&quot;, co-starring the Sophia Loren, the cinematographer used special low stands to light Ladd and the crew built a ramp system of heavy planks to enable the two actors to stand at equal eye level. In outdoor scenes, trenches were dug for Loren to stand in. For the film &quot;Saskatchewan&quot;, director Raoul Walsh had a hole dug for co-star Hugh O&#x27;Brian to stand in, while using the excavated dirt to build a mound for Ladd to stand, thereby overcoming the disparity in height.

==Death==
In January 1964, after injuring his knees, Ladd hoped to recuperate at his house in Palm Springs. On January 29, 1964, his butler said that he saw Ladd on his bed at 10 am; when he returned at 3:30 pm, he found Ladd dead on his bed.

His death, due to cerebral edema caused by an acute overdose of alcohol, a barbiturate, and two tranquilizers containing at least two depressants, was ruled accidental. Ladd suffered from chronic insomnia and regularly used sleeping pills and alcohol to induce sleep. While he had not taken a lethal amount of any one drug, the combination apparently caused fatal interaction. 

Ladd&#x27;s funeral was held on February 1, with Edmond O&#x27;Brien giving the eulogy. Fans were allowed to see his coffin. He was buried with his wedding ring and a letter that his son David had written to him.

Ladd died a wealthy man, with his holdings including a 5,000-acre ranch at Hidden Valley and a hardware store in Palm Springs. After he died, &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; was released and became a financial success.

<text>White City was a railway station on the Sunbury railway line (then the St Albans line) of the Melbourne suburban rail system in Melbourne, Australia. It was located approximately 700 metres west of Tottenham railway station. The next station down the line was Sunshine.

==History==

The station was opened on 10 December 1927, to serve the new White City greyhound racing track, named after the site of the 1908 London Olympics. The station was originally called Coursing Platform and was renamed White City on 25 August 1929.

Workmen&#x27;s trains from the city began stopping at the station on 10 June 1940, serving employees at local industries, such as the Olympic Tyres factory, but it was not until 28 June 1948, that trains returning to the city stopped at the station, when an afternoon &quot;up&quot; service was provided from the station&#x27;s single platform, using the crossover at the up end of the platform. White City was made a regular suburban station in December 1949. The station only ever had one platform, on the westbound track, even though fifty services a week stopped there at its peak. Due to its proximity to Tottenham station, White City&#x27;s signals were operated from there.

In the early 1980s, Tottenham station and its area underwent extensive alterations. The line was raised in order to eliminate the level crossing at Ashley Street, and a new high-level island platform was provided. As a consequence, it was decided to remove the nearby White City station. On 4 October 1981, White City was officially closed. It was later demolished, and no trace of its existence remains.

<doc id="517197" wikidata="Q5167913" url="?curid=517197" title="Cooperative distributed problem solving">
<text>In computing cooperative distributed problem solving is a of semi-autonomous processing nodes working together to solve a problem, typically in a multi-agent system. That is concerned with the investigation of problem subdivision, sub-problem distribution, results synthesis, optimisation of problem solver coherence and co-ordination. It is closely related to distributed constraint programming and distributed constraint optimization; see the links below.

==Aspects of CDPS==
* Neither global control or global data storage – no individual CDPS problem solver (agent) has sufficient information to solve the entire problem.
* Control and data are distributed
* Communication is slower than computation, therefore:
** Loose coupling between problem solvers
** Efficient protocols (not too much communication overhead)
** problems should be modular, coarse grained
* Any unique node is a potential bottleneck
** Organised behaviour is hard to guarantee since no one node has the complete picture

==See also==
* Multiscale decision making
* Distributed constraint optimization
* Distributed artificial intelligence
* Multi-agent planning

<text>USS &quot;Towers&quot; (DD-959/DDG-9) was a guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy notable for action in the Vietnam War. The ship was named in honor of Admiral John Henry Towers.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Towers&quot; keel was laid down on 1 April 1958 at Seattle, Washington, by the Todd Pacific Shipyards; launched on 23 April 1959; sponsored by Mrs. Nathaniel Rotoreau, Jr.; and commissioned on 6 June 1961 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington.

===1960s===

Homeported at San Diego, California, &quot;Towers&quot; carried out trials and local operations off the southern California coast into September 1961. She then conducted her shakedown cruise to Callao and Lima, Peru; Balboa, Panama Canal Zone; and Acapulco, Mexico, before she deployed to the Western Pacific (WestPac) for the first time in the early spring of 1962.

She arrived at Sydney, Australia, on 30 April to represent the United States during the 20th observance of the anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea and shifted to Melbourne a week later. She then continued her WestPac deployment with visits to Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Subic Bay, Philippines; Keeling, Taiwan; and Bangkok, Thailand. She then returned home via Guam and Hawaii.

Following a routine schedule of local operations out of San Diego from 1 January to 17 May 1963, &quot;Towers&quot; departed her home port on 18 May, bound for the Far East. En route, she stopped at Pearl Harbor and Midway and later took part in exercises and operations off Japan and in the Philippines. She returned to San Diego on 28 November 1963 and operated along the southern California coast. May &#x27;64 Towers entered dry dock at Hunters Point, San Francisco for a five-month overhaul. Returning to duty in early October she went through weeks of shakedown exercises prior to returning to her home port of San Diego.

&quot;Towers&quot; departed San Diego on 5 January 1965, bound for her third WestPac tour. As American forces became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War, escalating from an advisory capacity to active combat, the Navy&#x27;s role in Vietnamese coastal waters expanded. &quot;Towers&quot; participated in three main facets of the U.S. 7th Fleet&#x27;s operations in the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea. She performed screening and plane-guard duties for fast carrier task forces on Yankee Station, providing protection with her missiles and her rapid-fire 5-inch battery. In addition, she conducted search and rescue (SAR) patrols on the northern station; and made interdiction patrols in conjunction with Operation Market Time. Upon the conclusion of this tour, the guided missile destroyer sailed for home on 10 May. En route to the Hawaiian Islands, she participated in Operation Sailor Hat, a special blast test to determine deficiencies in modern ship construction, and arrived home at San Diego on 26 June.

From 31 January to 6 February 1966, &quot;Towers&quot; participated in Operation Buttonhook, a joint United States and Canadian exercise off the west coast of Canada and the United States which emphasized antisubmarine warfare (ASW) techniques. Following availability at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard during March, &quot;Towers&quot; took part in Operation Gray Ghost from 12 to 22 April. This exercise dealt with air control intercept tactics and antiaircraft warfare (AAA) measures to prepare the ship for her upcoming deployment to the Gulf of Tonkin, off Vietnam. In addition, the ship trained to become proficient in tactics to utilize against possible motor torpedo (PT) boat attacks.

Departing San Diego on 4 June 1966, &quot;Towers&quot; steamed west, via Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Subic Bay, to Vietnam. She expended some 3,266 rounds of 5-inch ammunition between 2 and 17 July, off target areas which included the &quot;Rung Sat Special Zone.&quot; Her target assessment included the destruction of 17 enemy buildings and damage to 118 more, the sinking of three sampans, the killing of 11 Viet Cong soldiers, and the destruction of a bridge. The guided missile destroyer returned to Subic Bay for upkeep and further training in PT-boat countermeasures before she returned to the Gulf of Tonkin to take up her position on the northern SAR station on 1 August. For the next month, under the command of Stanley Thomas Counts, she deployed with , keeping on the alert to spot downed pilots and to direct friendly helicopters to the rescue.

On 6 August 1966, &quot;Towers&quot; directed an HU-16 helicopter to the site of a downed aviator some 69 miles from the ship. The next day, &quot;Towers&quot; directed another HU-16 to a spot behind the enemy-held island of Cac Ba, where two Air Force men had bailed out. The helicopter successfully rescued them from behind communist lines. In the next two weeks, the ship participated in two more rescues—picking up two more Air Force pilots in one and a Navy flyer in the other.

&quot;Towers&#x27;&quot; most daring rescue came on the last day of her tour on the SARA station. On 31 August 1966, a Navy plane was hit by antiaircraft fire over Haiphong, and the pilot bailed out of his doomed aircraft directly over the enemy harbor. As he floated down under his parachute to face what seemed certain capture, &quot;Towers&quot; and closed to within visual range of Haiphong harbor. Then &quot;King&#x27;s&quot; helicopter sped in under the guidance of &quot;Towers&quot; experienced controllers and picked up the pilot, whisking him out of danger from beneath the enemy&#x27;s very nose.

After a brief rest and recreation period, &quot;Towers&quot; returned to the SAR station again on 1 October 1966. However, flying weather turned out to be poorer at this time of year, and air operations were sharply curtailed. Hence, &quot;Towers&quot; spent much of her time patrolling the Gulf of Tonkin.

Sailing for home on 21 November 1966, &quot;Towers&quot; departed Yokosuka and ran into heavy seas while en route to the west coast, suffering minor storm damage before she arrived at her home port on 3 December. After operations at sea from January 1967 to mid-March, &quot;Towers&quot; underwent a major overhaul at Hunters&#x27; Point Naval Shipyard from 14 April to 19 October. The guided missile destroyer then operated out of San Diego through the spring of 1968.

&quot;Towers&quot; then readied herself for her next WestPac deployment. Her preparation included screening and shore bombardment exercises with , the world&#x27;s only active battleship. Departing San Diego on 5 September 1968, &quot;Towers&quot; made stops at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay before arriving off the I Corps tactical zone to commence &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations.

While escorting and screening &quot;New Jersey&quot;, &quot;Towers&quot; knocked out two artillery and three antiaircraft gun sites; destroyed 55 meters of trenches; sank two logistics craft; set off 19 secondary explosions; and killed an estimated 10 enemy soldiers. On 1 October 1968, the ship rescued two downed airmen just south of the demilitarized zone (DMZ). The flyers, Capt. James Spaith, USMC, and his observer, 1st Lt. U.S. Grant, USMC, had been shot down when their Douglas A4F &quot;Skyhawk&quot; had been hit while spotting gunfire for &quot;New Jersey&quot;.

Following upkeep at Subic Bay, she planeguarded on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; for and returned to the I Corps operating zone for urgent gunfire support duties. She provided support for Operation Daring Endeavor launched to destroy enemy troop concentrations south of Da Nang. Commended for her part in this action, &quot;Towers&quot; remained on the scene from 17 to 30 November. She again provided anti-rocket support out of Da Nang from the 21st through the 25th. In addition, she provided gunfire for Korean marines: and the Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division.

&quot;Towers&quot; then sailed north to the Philippines for up keep at Subic Bay before proceeding to Singapore for rest and recreation. She arrived back on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; three days before Christmas, to assume the role of escort commander for . After two days of this duty, however, the guided missile destroyer was back in the IV Corps operating area on night-harassment fire duties against the communist ground forces.

New Year&#x27;s Day 1969 found the ship still engaging the enemy in the IV Corps&#x27; zone, supporting Vietnamese ranger battalions. During this period, &quot;Towers&quot; 5-inch rifles wreaked havoc upon Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troop concentrations, bunkers, sampans, and footbridges. The ship then spent a few days at Hong Kong before she returned to the &quot;gunline&quot;, once more at Da Nang. She supported the U.S. 3rd Marine Division, operating north and south of Da Nang, blasting enemy troops and structures, again in support of Korean marines and the 101st Airborne.

&quot;Towers&quot; furnished gunfire support for South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) units in January 1969 and shelled shore targets for the 3rd Marine Division and the 101st Airborne Division, both north and south of Da Nang. From her anchorage inside Da Nang harbor, the guided missile destroyer fired frequent night harassment and counter-rocket site fire against communist positions in the surrounding countryside. Her damage assessments for this duty included destruction of targets such as troop concentrations, bunkers, footbridges, and supply-carrying sampans.

Shifting again to &quot;Yankee Station&quot;, &quot;Towers&quot; joined the screen of on station with TG 77.5 until 7 February. She then sailed for Subic Bay for three days of upkeep before proceeding on to Yokosuka. Departing Japanese waters on 21 February, &quot;Towers&quot; soon headed east and brought this WestPac deployment to a close when she sailed into San Diego harbor on 4 March 1969.

===1970s===
&quot;Towers&quot; spent much of the year 1970 on routine local operations in the vicinity of her home port in preparation for future WestPac deployments. On 4 September, while conducting refresher training out of San Diego, the ship directed a helicopter to rescue the pilot from an F-8 Crusader that had crashed nearby. The embarked evaluation team from the Fleet Training Group gave the ship a grade of &quot;outstanding&quot; during this &quot;unscheduled evolution.&quot;

Deploying again to WestPac on 7 January 1971, &quot;Towers&quot; proceeded to Vietnamese waters, via Pearl Harbor and Midway. While she proceeded west on 20 January, one of the other ships in her convoy, , suffered a major engine room fire which stopped her dead in the water. &quot;Towers&quot; turned-to and lent a hand. After the fire was extinguished, the guided missile destroyer took &quot;Roark&quot; in tow until arrived and took over the towing.

&quot;Towers&quot; arrived back on the gunline on 8 February and provided gunfire support until the 21st, when she moved to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; to provide plane-guard service for . On 6 March, a member of the carrier&#x27;s flight deck force was blown over the side during launching operations. &quot;Towers&quot; quickly sped to the scene, rescued the sailor, and returned him to his ship.

A short visit to Subic Bay followed, as did another tour on the gunline and the northern SAR station. The ship then returned to Subic Bay for upkeep and then made still another tour as plane guard and screen for . She departed WestPac on 1 July. Arriving at San Diego on the 15th, &quot;Towers&quot; operated out of her home base into the early spring of 1972. Gunnery exercises, underway training evolutions (with emphasis on ASW and AAW tactics); plane-guarding for ; and an upkeep and inport period all followed as the ship prepared for her upcoming WestPac deployment.

Events in Vietnam, however, forced a change in plan for &quot;Towers&quot; and rapidly accelerated her return to the war zone. Although not scheduled for deployment until September, she departed the west coast on 20 June, bound once more for-the gunline. A massive Viet Cong and North Vietnamese assault had battered South Vietnamese forces in key Quang Tri Province and resulted in emergency measures for the supporting naval forces offshore. During the voyage from the west coast to the South China Sea, the ship assisted in the rescue of six crewmen from a downed B-52 Stratofortress near Guam and received a commendation from the United States Secretary of the Navy.

A curtailed two-day upkeep period at Subic Bay preceded the ship&#x27;s sailing on 13 July for the gunline. Heavy commitments and long hours of gunfire support duty in support of ARVN troops followed from 17 to 28 July as &quot;Towers&quot; participated in Operation Lamson 72. From 29 July to 5 August, the ship operated on &quot;Linebacker&quot; strikes against targets to the northward of the DMZ, in North Vietnam, as part of Task Unit 77.1.2. On several occasions during this time, she came under fire from communist shore batteries.

The intense gunfire support duties assigned to the ship soon wore out the linings of her two 5-inch guns, so the ship sailed for Sasebo, where she spent the week from 9 to 15 August undergoing a re-gunning. She soon returned to the &quot;gunline&quot; and supported ARVN troops off Huế. The destroyer also fired night &quot;Linebacker&quot; strikes on 24 and 25 September, rounding out the month with gunfire support missions fired for the 1st ARVN division.

A visit to Hong Kong for needed rest and recreation for her crew soon followed, and an upkeep period at Subic Bay preceded the ship&#x27;s return to Vietnamese waters on 21 October. She supported the ARVN 22d Division near Qui Nhon and around Quang Tri. She then again visited Subic Bay and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, before returning to the gunline again from 3 to 8 December. For the rest of the month, &quot;Towers&quot; fired gunfire support missions against North Vietnamese troop concentrations near Quang Tri. Spirited exchanges of gunfire with enemy shore batteries took place on numerous occasions during this period.

She finished the year 1972 again serving as plane guard for &quot;Constellation&quot; on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; and closed out her grueling seven-month deployment on the last day of the year, when she sailed for Yokosuka. From there, she returned home via Midway and Pearl Harbor.

This deployment turned out to be the destroyer&#x27;s last in support of the Vietnam War. The &quot;Vietnamization&quot; plan placed the burden of self-defense on the shoulders of the South Vietnamese, as American land, sea, and air forces were withdrawn from combat in January and February 1973. &quot;Towers&quot; returned to San Diego and soon under-went refurbishment at Long Bach shipyards. Towers then operated out of San Diego from 1973 through 1976, pursuing a regular schedule of local operations, routine upkeep and overhaul periods, and underway training evolutions.

Towers departed San Diego on 30 July 1976 for her first extended overseas deployment in three years. She conducted exercises and local operations in the western Pacific (WESTPAC) while stationed at Subic Bay Naval Station, Philippines. Towers participated in Exercise &quot;Sharkhunt XVII&quot; with the Taiwanese Navy and made a port call in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Towers then performed an extended cruise through the busy Strait of Malacca into the Indian Ocean, with port calls to Singapore, Colombo, Sri Lanka and Karachi, Pakistan. While in Columbo the crew of the USS Towers were honored as guests of the European diplomatic community and the U.S. Marines embassy detachment at the coastal European diplomatic recreation center, overlooking the Indian Ocean.

While in the Indian Ocean Towers took part in &quot;Midlink 76&quot; with units of the Iranian, Pakistani, British, and American Navies in mid-November.

Towers then returned to the South China Sea where she participated in &quot;Multiplex/Missilex-76&quot; with other United States 7th Fleet units.

Following port visits to Hong Kong from 6 to 12 January and Bangkok, Thailand from 29 January to 4 February 1977, &quot;Towers&quot; engaged in a coordinated ASW (Anti-Submarine-Warfare) exercise, &quot;Sharkhunt XX&quot;, with the Taiwanese Navy from 22 to 25 February and made a second port call in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

She returned to San Diego via Hawaii on 21 March to complete her seven-month, three-week WESTPAC deployment. Post-deployment operations off the west coast were highlighted by port visits to San Francisco, California and Vancouver, British Columbia, from 9 to 17 July for Vancouver&#x27;s annual Sea Festival. &quot;Towers&quot; last significant operations at sea for the year occurred during the period 12 to 16 September when she conducted naval gunfire support exercises on the range at San Clemente Island. On 23 September, the guided missile destroyer commenced a four-month availability at San Diego which took her into the new year.

Post-availability trials commenced on 26 January 1978, and &quot;Towers&quot; spent the next nine months evaluating her radar detection and tracking system during numerous at-sea operations for that purpose. On 14 November, the ship got underway for Long Beach where she entered the Naval Shipyard on the 15th for commencement of a regular overhaul which took her into 1979.

==1980s==

In January 1980, &quot;Towers&quot;&#x27; ships&#x27; company received news that the ship&#x27;s home port would change to Yokosuka, Japan, in October. The crew spent the next nine months preparing for the homeport change, which required passing a series of service inspections, repairing engineering casualties and preparing for overseas deployment. In July, &quot;Towers&quot; underwent a special availability at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, arriving on the 13th for repairs to her missile launcher system. The repairs only took two weeks since replacement parts were obtained from the decommissioned guided missile cruiser . Departing San Diego on 14 October, &quot;Towers&quot; sailed for Japan, arriving in Yokosuka via Pearl Harbor on 10 November. Following an upkeep period through 12 December, the warship conducted a short familiarization cruise in Japanese waters until the 19th whereupon she began a holiday leave and upkeep period.

After a series of local operations and exercises, including an ASW exercise with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) warships, &quot;Towers&quot; sailed to the Middle East in mid-April to relieve guided missile cruiser as radar picket ship in the Persian Gulf. Concluding operations on 14 May, she slowly made her way home, visiting Thailand, Singapore, and Subic Bay, as well as rescuing 138 Vietnamese refugees from three small craft in the South China Sea before putting into Yokosuka on 11 June. Less than a month later, &quot;Towers&quot; was on hand for another rescue on 4 July, this time picking up 26 survivors from a South Korean freighter that had gone down in bad weather 25 miles east of Hong Kong. A planned restricted availability at Yokosuka followed, during which the yard replaced both propellers as well as the sandblasted and repainted the hull. Maintenance problems hampered the warship over the next few months, but the guided missile destroyer managed to conduct multiple training evolutions with two aircraft carrier battle groups as they transited the area.

&quot;Towers&quot; resumed local operations in early February 1982 with an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise off Sasebo with JMSDF ships &quot;Kurama&quot; and &quot;Sagami&quot;. During the exercise, the warship successfully fired practice torpedoes at submarine . After a cruise to Okinawa and Hong Kong later in the month, &quot;Towers&quot; joined carrier &quot;Midway&quot; and the rest of Battle Group Alpha for an operational &quot;tune-up&quot; prior to Exercise Team Spirit &#x27;82 in mid-March. Operations with the battle group continued off and on until 5 May, when the guided missile destroyer shifted to the carrier &quot;Ranger&quot; Battle Group. Over the next three days she conducted close-in AAW defense and plane guard duties for &quot;Ranger&quot; during &quot;war-at-sea&quot; exercises. In company with &quot;Reeves&quot;, &quot;Towers&quot; successfully fired two SM-1 missiles before steaming to Subic Bay on 22 May for a two-week upkeep period. Following Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) qualifications, the guided missile destroyer returned to Yokosuka on 18 June.

Following a restricted availability through July 1982, &quot;Towers&quot; resumed the familiar pattern of operations out of Yokosuka. These included battle group training evolutions with &quot;Midway&quot;, ASW exercises with Japanese warships as well as investigating and shadowing Soviet warships in the northern Pacific, a regimen that lasted through September. On 12 October, she got underway with Battle Group Alpha for a voyage to the Indian Ocean, stopping at Subic Bay the next day and then sailing for Singapore. While en route, the warship rescued 65 Vietnamese refugees from a small craft in the South China Sea and transferred them to &quot;Midway&quot; for further processing. The warships then conducted exercises with Singapore naval and air units in late October, visited Pattaya beach, Thailand, in early November, and conducted battle group operations while en route to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka via Hong Kong on 10 December.

In mid-January 1983, &quot;Towers&quot; commenced Team Spirit &#x27;83, a joint exercise off South Korea, followed by the periodic Nuclear Weapons Certification inspection. After a short period at Yokosuka (10–27 February 1983), the warship conducted another set of battle group operations. Unfortunately, during the afternoon watch on 2 March, while en route to Chinhae, Korea, a ruptured steam line in number one fire room inflicted serious injuries on FNs Pino and Jones and BT2 Dyer; all were med-evaced by helicopter to &quot;Midway&quot;. FN Pino died from his injuries. &quot;Towers&quot; subsequently returned to Sasebo for repairs between 2–19 March. Following more battle group operations, the ship returned to Chinhae for a Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection (23–27 March), thereafter participating in FleetEx 83-1, a major northern Pacific exercise involving carriers , and &quot;Midway&quot;. Gunnery exercises in April, a joint midshipmen cruise with the JMSDF out of Kure and Valiant Usher 83, a combined amphibious assault exercise off the coast of Korea, rounded out the summer. After a maintenance availability in Yokosuka (13–25 August), &quot;Towers&quot; sailed south with DesRon 15, bound for the Indian Ocean. During the transit, the guided missile destroyer helped track a Soviet guided missile submarine and her escorts through the Malacca Straits. On 20 September, she arrived at Diego Garcia to refuel, subsequently transiting to Phuket, Thailand, for a five-day visit. After a stop at Subic Bay on 11 October, the warship supported the final salvage stages of salvage work at the Korean Air Lines Flight 007 crash site (22 October – 6 November) before reaching Yokosuka on 9 November.

&quot;Towers&quot; underwent a major overhaul at Yokosuka during most of 1984, receiving the Harpoon anti-ship missile system, improved electronics equipment and major work on boiler tubes and brickwork. Conducting her first sea trials after the overhaul (4–7 September), she departed Yokosuka ahead of schedule on 17 October for two months of combat systems certification in the Hawaiian operating areas.

Following a series of service inspections in January and February 1985, &quot;Towers&quot; conducted refresher training off South Korea and out of Subic Bay before sailing south for Cobra Gold &#x27;85, a joint training exercise with the Thai military held 7–16 July. During her transit south, &quot;Towers&quot; rescued another group of Vietnamese refugees, her fourth such humanitarian rescue in her career. Subsequent to Cobra Gold, the guided missile destroyer steamed to the North Arabian Sea via Singapore and Diego Garcia, arriving on station on 4 August. Battle group operations remained fairly quiet, with the warship tasked to track Soviet or Indian aircraft on a periodic basis. Tragedy struck on the night of 7 August, however, when Liberty 603, an E-2C from VAW-115, impacted the water off &quot;Midway&quot;&#x27;s flight deck. The search and rescue effort, in which &quot;Towers&quot; participated, yielded three of the five crew members; Lt.(j.g.) Kevin R. Kuhnigk, USNR, and Ens. Christopher Mims, USNR, however, perished in the mishap. After a &quot;war-at-sea&quot; exercise in the Indian Ocean, Battle Group Alpha steamed southeast to western Australia, where &quot;Towers&quot; enjoyed five days of liberty in Geraldton, Australia (13–19 September). Thereafter, she participated in Valiant Usher &#x27;85, a joint exercise with Australian forces, and AnnualEx 85, a joint U.S.-Japanese operation, before reaching Yokosuka on 15 October.

After a series of local operations and individual ship exercises, &quot;Towers&quot; participated in Exercise Team Spirit 86 off Korea in late February and early March 1986. Upon her return home on 3 April 1986, the guided missile destroyer underwent and passed four major inspections; a command security inspection, (24 April) a combat systems readiness test (14–19 April), a Board of Inspection and Survey visit (5–9 May) and a boiler inspection (12 May). After celebrating her 25th anniversary on 29 May, &quot;Towers&quot; hosted a celebration in her home port for crew and their families, as well as local dignitaries. She then returned to certifications, service exams and inspections, tasks that kept the crew busy until mid-September when she sailed for Guam. After participation in multinational exercise CrowEater &#x27;86, the guided missile destroyer sailed south for a series of port visits in eastern Australia, stopping at Cairns, Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane before returning home on 15 November via Cairns and Guam.

The new year got off to a good start with the crew receiving &quot;outstanding&quot; in all areas during the 5–8 January 1987 command inspection. Local operations followed, including training for the annual March–April Exercise Team Spirit &#x27;87. On 15–19 May &quot;Towers&quot; took part in the Shimoda Black Ship Festival, celebrating the visit of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry&#x27;s squadron to Japan in July 1853. She spent the rest of the summer in preparation for another Indian Ocean deployment, upon which she embarked on 15 October. After a stop at Subic Bay in November, the warship sailed to the Persian Gulf, beginning the new year moored alongside the destroyer tender for availability at Masirah, Oman.

Upon completion, &quot;Towers&quot;, in company with frigate , sailed to Karachi, Pakistan, for a five-day port visit (14–18 January 1988) during which the commanding officer called upon the CNO of the Pakistan Navy. The guided missile destroyer subsequently made her way to the Republic of the Maldives for a four-day port visit and then to Diego Garcia for five days. After a stop at Pattaya Beach, Thailand, in mid-February, &quot;Towers&quot; accomplished her fifth rescue of Vietnamese refugees on 29 February, picking up 126 survivors of a &quot;grossly overloaded&quot; boat with a broken-down engine and no food or water. Continuing on home, the guided missile destroyer stopped at Subic Bay and Hong Kong before participating in the annual bilateral exercise Team Spirit 87 off South Korea (16 March – 3 April). Following local exercises, &quot;Towers&quot; participated in a joint exercise with the Japanese in the Philippine Sea (13–19 May), an ASW exercise in the Sea of Japan (11–14 June), before putting to sea on the 23rd for Exercise Mekar 88 alongside ships of the Royal Malaysian Navy (7–13 July). She combined that operation with Exercise Cobra Gold 88 off Thailand (24 July – 1 August), upon completion of which she returned to Yokosuka for a 90-day restricted availability.

Upon completion of repairs, which included replacing both 5-inch gun mounts, the warship conducted sea trials and gunnery drills starting on 9 November 1988. During those evolutions, however, some shells fell both within Japanese territorial waters and near a cutter of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency (JMSA), &quot;Uraga&quot; (PLH-04). The U.S. Navy report stated that &quot;no vessel or object was used as a target&quot; and that the place of impact was 1,900 meters away from the cutter, but the JMSA investigation said that the shells fell continuously at a distance of 300 to 500 meters from the cutter, and Japanese Diet members pointed out the possibility that the shells were aimed at the cutter. The Japan government protested the incident and the Navy relieved &quot;Towers&quot;&#x27; commanding officer &quot;for cause without relief.&quot; Despite the embarrassing incident, the warship resumed local operations soon after.

Departing Yokosuka on 6 January 1989, &quot;Towers&quot; sailed south for refresher training out of Subic Bay. Engineering trouble hampered these evolutions, however, and the guided missile destroyer put into the Ship Repair Facility (SRF) there for repairs in late January. Detailed inspections quickly determined that the guided missile destroyer had suffered damage to turbine blades as well as both propellers. &quot;It was amazing&quot;, one technician commented later, &quot;that the whole turbine did not disintegrate.&quot; The guided missile destroyer finally put to sea for exercises with the &quot;Midway&quot; Battle Group in June. After a month-long stay at Yokosuka starting on 15 July, &quot;Towers&quot; sailed south for more exercises with the battle group. While in transit to Pattaya Beach in late August, however, the warship received the news that Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, USMC, kidnapped by Iranian-supported terrorists in Beirut, Lebanon, the previous February, had been murdered. Ordered to the Indian Ocean for contingency operations, as well as to oversee the end of tanker convoy operations in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Towers&quot; patrolled those waters until early October. She then sailed south for a port visit to Mombasa, Kenya, 18–21 October, before arriving in Subic Bay on 27 November. Although &quot;Towers&quot; departed 1 December, an attempted coup d&#x27;état in the Philippines kept her there for a week of contingency operations before she arrived home on 11 December.

Although the guided missile destroyer continued intermittent local operations in early 1990, &quot;Towers&quot; received word of future decommissioning and began inactivation inspections in April. She got underway for the last time on 18 June, to serve as plane guard for &quot;Midway&quot;, and visited Pusan, South Korea, before returning to Yokosuka on the 30th.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

On 17 July 1990, &quot;Towers&quot; moved to drydock for inactivation procedures, and she was decommissioned at Yokosuka on 1 October 1990. She later was towed to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 May 1992. Plans to convert her into a barge were cancelled, and ultimately the guided-missile frigate sank her as a target in a fleet training exercise (SinkEx) off the coast of California on 9 October 2002.

==Honors and awards==

* Navy Unit Commendation
* Meritorious Unit Commendation
* Vietnam Service Medal with four battle stars

&quot;Towers&quot; received one Navy Unit Commendation, one Meritorious Unit Commendation, and four battle stars for her service during the Vietnam War.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Tower&quot;′s captain&#x27;s gig is on display at Freedom Park in Omaha, Nebraska.

<text>Boffin is a British slang term for a scientist, engineer, or other person engaged in technical or scientific research and development. A &quot;boffin&quot; was viewed by some in the regular military or government services as odd, quirky or peculiar, though quite bright and essential to helping in the war effort through having and developing the key ideas leading to transformative military capabilities.

==Origins==

===Civil===

The origins and etymology of &quot;boffin&quot; are obscure. A link to the mathematician and evolutionary theorist Buffon has been proposed. Alternatively, linguist Eric Partridge proposed the term derived from Nicodemus Boffin, the good-hearted &#x27;golden dustman&#x27; character who appears in the novel &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; (1864/5) by Charles Dickens, described there as a &quot;very odd-looking old fellow indeed&quot;. In the novel, Mr Boffin pursues a late-life education, employing Silas Wegg to teach him to read.

William Morris also has a man called Boffin, based on Charles Dickens and said to be a variant of &#x27;Biffin&#x27;, meet the newly arrived time traveller in his novel &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890). Dickens had referred to a &#x27;Miss Biffins&#x27;, an artist with only vestigial arms and legs, in Martin Chuzzlewit (1843). Thus at this time a &#x27;Boffin&#x27; is a good-hearted person who has suffered from &#x27;hard times&#x27;, been ill-regarded, taken an opportunity to better themselves and done well, demonstrating remarkable social mobility. Possibly ill-favoured in appearance, possibly artistic.

In 1894 Augustine Birrell invented a fictional character Rev. Boffin B.A. to epitomize those who bothered fellow Liberal politician Sir Frank Lockwood with seeming trifles. Sir Frank turned the joke on Birrell by writing letters to the papers and critical of him as if from Boffin, later published a popular book of cartoons on the affair and was only then identified as the author, as described in Birrell&#x27;s humorous biography of Sir Frank.

J. R. R. Tolkien also had a police sergeant called Boffin in his children&#x27;s tale &quot;Mr. Bliss&quot; (written around 1932, published 1982), but he is said to have derived the name from an Oxford family of bakers and confectioners rather than Dickens (as confirmed by his daughter Priscilla Tolkien). He later used Boffin as a surname for a family in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937). This family provides the main heroes, who meet Dickens&#x27; mould and are also small, like Sarah Biffen.

===Military===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; quotes use in &quot;The Times&quot; in September 1945 based on a Ministry of Aircraft Production press release:
Malvern was home to both the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) and the Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE), who were later merged into the Radar Research Establishment (RRE). It developed RADAR in support of all the services. The then superintendent of TRE, A.P. Rowe used the term &#x27;boffin&#x27; to refer to earlier R.A.F. usage and by 1942 an RAF training film (School for Secrets) cited &#x27;boffin&#x27; as armed-forces slang for an RAF technician or research scientist. 
Post war, Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the British radar pioneer, cited Robert Hanbury Brown, who had been at RAF Bawdsey (later part of TRE), as the prototypical boffin, noting: &quot;It is quite wrong to use the word ‘boffin’ simply to describe a scientist or technician; a boffin is essentially a middleman, a bridge between two worlds ...&quot;.

Sir Robert cites Air Vice-Marshal G. P. Chamberlain, who played a vital part in the use of radar to defeat night-bombers, as the source of the word. Chamberlain himself claimed that &#x27;A Puffin, a bird with a mournful cry, got crossed with a Baffin, a mercifully obsolete Fleet Air Arm aircraft. Their offspring was a Boffin, a bird of astonishingly queer appearance, bursting with weird and sometimes inopportune ideas, but possessed of staggering inventiveness, analytical powers and persistence. Its ideas, like its eggs, were conical and unbreakable. You push the unwanted ones away, and they just roll back.&#x27;&quot;. A naval origin is supported by reports of an anti-submarine trial by HM Signal School April 1, 1941 based on equipment from TRE. Eric Partridge, in his dictionary of slang, noted that the word had been used in the Royal Navy as &quot;an unkind term for any officer over forty&quot;, but this usage seems to have been overshadowed by that referred to by the OED, above.

Of its etymology Sir Robert himself wrote: “I am not quite sure about the true origins of this name of Boffin. ... I am sure it has nothing at all to do with that first literary “Back Room Boy,” the claustrophiliac Colonel Boffin, who as you remember never overtly emerged from his back room, although his voice was clearly audible from it. It is the very essence of the Boffin that he should emerge frequently and almost aggressively from the Back Room to which, however, he must return on his missions of interpretation and inspiration.” 

The origin of the term appears to be Naval, rather than Air, but its main usage seems to have originated with Naval officers working with civilian radar &#x27;boffins&#x27; and quickly adapted by other servicemen and boffins themselves.

A key innovation at TRE was Rowe&#x27;s &#x27;Sunday Soviets&#x27;. These reflected the lessons identified from the Great War as reflected in the Haldane principle, but adapted to suit the operational challenges. They allowed the boffins both to contribute more, and to be more recognized.

== Usage ==
===World War II===
World War II was regarded by many as a &#x27;Wizard War&#x27;.

War-time and immediate post-war reference to scientists was particularly associated with radar, either Malvern or Farnborough. 
Alternatively, Lindemann noted that Mervyn O&#x27;Gorman had inaugurated the use of scientific methods in aeronautical development at the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough, developing a cadre of &#x27;leaders and explorers&#x27; who have retrospectively been termed &#x27;boffins&#x27;. Some &quot;have been careful to differentiate between the true boffin and the &#x27;nark&#x27;, who was a member of the scientific staff of the Experimental Flying Section at Farnborough.&#x27; Similarly, the Secretary of State for War cites the contribution of an operational analyst to the U-boat war in 1943.”

The radar pioneer Robert Watson-Watt provided the following definition: &quot;The Boffin is a researcher, of high scientific competence, who has learned that a device of great technical elegance, capable of a remarkable performance in the hands of a picked crew, is not necessarily a good weapon of war. He is the instrument for building into the design provisions which depend on close analysis of the vehicle in which the device is to operate, the field conditions in which it is to operate and above all things, the competence of those who are to operate, maintain, and repair it. He alone can save us from the danger of engendering electronic dinosaurs; he alone can provide on the one hand the knowledge on which the machine can be measured to the man and on the other, the knowledge on which can be based the selection, training, and (this is important) the inspiration of the normal human beings on whom its successful use, in the end, must rest. He must have an understanding and an appreciation of these normal human beings. He can reach these only through having their confidence. He is a middleman, but he is a middleman who can effect enormous economies and enormous increases in efficiencies. He is a rare bird, but he should be free to flit over the whole field of defense science, its origins, and its applications.&quot; He also noted that “It is a term of respect, and admiration, but particularly a term of affection—an affection which is expressed, as is the English way, in a slightly outside-in, jocular way so that the affection and admiration may not be regarded as too demonstrative.”

Thus a Boffin seems the type of person described by Isaac Newton (1642–1726/7), who, in his advice to the Admiralty, made an important distinction when he said that &#x27;if, instead of sending observations of seamen to able mathematicians on land, the land would be able to send able mathematicians to sea, it would signify much more to the improvement of navigation and the safety of men&#x27;s lives and estates on that element.&#x27;

Watson-Watt stated that &#x27;the bill of the boffin has two separate functions. One is to poke into other people&#x27;s business and the other is to puncture &#x27;the more highly coloured and ornate eggs of the 
, which are quite inappropriate to the military scene.&#x27; Henry Tizard has also been regarded as the prototypical boffin.

According to the Daily Herald, &quot;backroom boys known throughout the services of the United Nations [were known] as `Boffins`. [It] should be considered a badge of honour.&quot;

On VJ Day the Daily Herald reported: ”This is `Boffins Day` because for the first time it is permissible to tell something of the war saga of the backroom boys known throughout the services of the United Nations as `Boffins`. It is a dramatic and romantic story of a battle of wits, brains and inventive genius between the scientists of the United Nations and those of the enemy and the United Nations Team won hands down. … Theirs was the best kept secret of the war they were conducting what had been aptly described as the very heart of the United Nations war effort.”

===Cold War===
In 1952 the Secretary of State for War noted the need to develop &#x27;Colonel Boffins&#x27; at Shrivenham (1952).

Notably, Richard Vincent acquired the nickname &#x27;the boffin&#x27; after working at Malvern (1960–62) as a Gunnery Staff Captain and, via RMCS Shrivenham, rose to become Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom).

In the 12 January 1953 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, a short article on Malcolm Compston depicted him testing &quot;the Admiralty&#x27;s new plastic survival suit&quot; in the Arctic Ocean; the article, entitled &quot;Cold Bath for a Boffin&quot;, defines the term for its American audience as &quot;civilian scientist working with the British Navy&quot; and notes that his potentially life-saving work demonstrates &quot;why the term &#x27;boffin&#x27;, which first began as a sailor&#x27;s expression of joking contempt, has become instead one of affectionate admiration&quot;. By 1956 the US Navy apparently regarded boffins as too influential.

By 1962 Boffins were characterised as &#x27;the man (sic) who could understand the viewpoint of the Services, who worked with them, and who frequently shared their dangers&#x27; and R V Jones, wartime head of scientific intelligence, was referred to as a boffin.
By the late 60s the term was sometimes being used to include all scientists who had worked at Malvern, irrespective of how closely they worked with the services, even &#x27;backroom&#x27; staff.

===Post Cold War===
&quot;Boffin&quot; continued, in the immediate postwar period, to carry some of its wartime connotation, as a modern-day wizard who labours in secret to create incomprehensible devices of great power. For example, the comics of the period depicted them as developing imaginative machines.
However, their more nuanced wartime role was not reflected in popular culture, such as the 1951 Festival of Britain
 and the term was used in the UK parliament (1953) to refer to boffins as either narrow academics or the catalyst for growth.

The image of the technical hero was popularised by Nevil Shute&#x27;s novel &quot;No Highway&quot; (1948), Paul Brickhill&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;The Dambusters&quot; (1951) and Shute&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Slide Rule&quot; (1954). &quot;The Dambusters&quot; film (1954) also featured boffins as heroes, as did stand-alone films such as &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Sound Barrier&quot; (1952).

John Wyndham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot; (1953) includes a song called &quot;The Boffin&#x27;s Lament&quot; or &quot;The Lay of the Baffled Boffin&quot;, with Naval Boffins. By 1958 sound engineers such as Shute and Frank Cordell were being referred to as ‘Pop Boffins’.
 More recently, the term &#x27;boffin&#x27; has been used to cover all of Churchill&#x27;s war-winning Wizards, including atomic scientists, aeronautical engineers and the scientists of the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (including Shute). By the late 60s the term boffins was being used for any research scientists who were making a difference. Alan Turing has been described as a &#x27;boffin&#x27; both for his cryptanalytic wizardry and his backroom work on computers, as have some &#x27;Pop&#x27; architects.

However, while the main characters in the semi-autobiographical films &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (1948) and &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; (1948) came good in the end, many scientists were presented as figures of fun, including those working with computers, in bomb disposal and on aircraft. Moreover the films (unlike the books) used the term &#x27;Boffin&#x27; to apply to any Back-Room Boy, with unfortunate connotations. By 1959 a biography refers to &#x27;muzzle-headed boffins in cob-webby small backrooms&#x27;.

Moreover between 1968 and 1972 a series of English language primers portraying a &#x27;mad professor&#x27;, reinforced by a British TV children&#x27;s comedy Bright&#x27;s Boffins (1970–72), became the stereotype for children&#x27;s literature.
&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI:10.1017/9781108529501&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s boffins were relegated, in UK popular culture, to semi-comic supporting characters such as Q, the fussy armourer-inventor in the James Bond films, and the term itself gradually took on a negative connotation within society at large.
Thus, by the late 1990s, while the need for &#x27;high-calibre&#x27; research staff with &#x27;intimate knowledge&#x27; of users and their potential needs was well recognized by potential employers, the term &#x27;boffin&#x27; was no longer used in its original sense, lest it conjure up images of &#x27;mad scientists&#x27;.


This negative view changed after 2003, with &quot;Backroom Boys: The Secret Return of the British Boffin&quot;, but without making the original distinction between &#x27;back-room boys&#x27; and boffins. By 2009 a popular history noted how enthusiastic &#x27;home-taught boffins&#x27; and academics contributed to both world wars, and came to have &#x27;key positions in directing the war effort&#x27; and a nostalgic popular book to accompany the Science Museum&#x27;s &#x27;Dan Dare and the Birth of High-Tech Britain&#x27; Exhibition described the optimism as the war-time boffins turned their attention to turning Britain into &#x27;a place of ingenious, and beautifully crafted home-spun technology and design&#x27;, until thwarted by the consumerist policies of Harold Macmillan. Norman Foster is cited as carrying forward the spirit of the boffin.

===Popular culture===
The term &#x27;boffin&#x27; has become widely used in the UK popular media to refer to any scientist or scientific expert, especially those engaged in research. The Institute of Physics is running a campaign to limit this usage, due to the negative image.

In its July 1984 edition, Road and Track commented: &quot;Peter Wright, formerly aerodynamic engineer for Team Lotus Research and Development, is known there as &#x27;The Boffin&#x27; for his scientific wizardry.&quot; This Boffin would go on to pioneer active suspension in Formula-One.

The term is used frequently in the sketches of comedy duo &quot; Mitchell &amp; Webb &quot;, particularly in the reoccurring sketch Big Talk.
