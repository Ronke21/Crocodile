<text>Aryanism, is an ideology of German racial supremacy which views the supposed Aryan race as a distinct and superior racial group which is entitled to rule the rest of humanity. Initially promoted by racial theorists such as Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Aryanism reached its peak of influence in Nazi Germany. In the 1930s and 40s, the regime applied the ideology with full force, sparking World War II with the 1939 invasion of Poland in pursuit of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, or living space, for the Aryan people. The racial policies which were implemented by the Nazis during the 1930s came to a head during their conquest of Europe and the Soviet Union, culminating in the industrial mass murder of six million Jews and eleven million other victims in what is now known as the Holocaust.

==Background==
By the late 19th century, a number of later writers, such as the French anthropologist Vacher de Lapouge in his book &quot;L&#x27;Aryen&quot;, argued that this superior branch could be identified biologically by using the cephalic index (a measure of head shape) and other indicators. He argued that the long-headed &quot;dolichocephalic-blond&quot; Europeans, characteristically found in Northern Europe, were natural leaders, destined to rule over more &quot;brachycephalic&quot; (short-headed) peoples. Similar theories were promoted by Nordicists like Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain.

== Nazi Aryanism ==

The ideology of Nazism was based upon the conception of the ancient Aryan race being a superior race, holding the highest position in the racial hierarchy and that the Nordic-type Germanic peoples were the most racially pure existing peoples of Aryan stock. The Nazi conception of the Aryan race arose from earlier proponents of a supremacist conception of the race as described by racial theorist figures such as Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain.

Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther identified the European race as having five subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine, and East Baltic. Günther applied a Nordicist conception that Nordics were the highest in the racial hierarchy amongst these five European subtype races. In his book &quot;Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes&quot; (1922) (Racial Science of the German People), Günther recognized Germans as being composed of all five European subtypes, but emphasized the strong Nordic heritage amongst Germans. Günther believed Slavic people to be of Eastern race, one that was separate from Germans and Nordics, and warned about mixing German blood with Slavic one. He defined each racial subtype according to general physical appearance and their psychological qualities including their racial soul – referring to their emotional traits and religious beliefs, and provided detailed information on their hair, eye, and skin colours, facial structure. He provided photographs of Germans identified as Nordic in places like Baden, Stuttgart, Salzburg, and Schwaben; and provided photographs of Germans he identified as Alpine and Mediterranean types, especially in Vorarlberg, Bavaria, and the Black Forest region of Baden. Adolf Hitler read &quot;Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes,&quot; which influenced his racial policy and resulted in Günther&#x27;s Nazi-backed attainment of a position in the anthropology department at the University of Jena in 1932 where Hitler attended Günther&#x27;s inaugural lecture.

Günther distinguished Aryans from Jews, and identified Jews as descending from non-European races, particularly from what he classified as the Near Asian race (&quot;Vorderasiatische Rasse&quot;), more commonly known as the Armenoid race, and said that such origins rendered Jews fundamentally different from and incompatible with Germans and most Europeans. This association of Jews with the Armenoid type had been utilized by Zionist Jews who claimed that Jews were a group within that type. He claimed that the Near Eastern race descended from the Caucasus in the fifth and fourth millennia BC, and that it had expanded into Asia Minor and Mesopotamia and eventually to the west coast of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Aside from ascribing Armenians and Jews as having Near Eastern characteristics, he ascribed them to several other contemporary peoples; he included some Greeks, Turks, Syrians, and Iranians as having these characteristics as well. In his work &quot;Racial Characteristics of the Jewish People&quot;, he defined the racial soul of the Near Eastern race as emphasizing a commercial spirit (&quot;Handelgeist&quot;), and described them as artful traders – a term that Günther ascribed as being used by Jewish racial theorist Samuel Weissenberg to describe contemporary Armenians, Greeks, and Jews. Günther added to that description of the Near Eastern type as being composed primarily of commercially spirited and artful traders, by claiming that the type held strong psychological manipulation skills that aided them in trade. He claimed that the Near Eastern race had been bred not so much for the conquest and exploitation of nature as it was for the conquest and exploitation of people.

Hitler&#x27;s conception of the Aryan &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; (master race) explicitly excluded the vast majority of Slavs, regarding the Slavs as having dangerous Jewish and Asiatic influences. Because of this, the Nazis declared Slavs to be &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (subhumans). Exceptions were made for a small percentage of Slavs who were seen by the Nazis to be descended from German settlers and therefore fit to be Germanised to be considered part of the Aryan folk or nation. Hitler described Slavs as a mass of born slaves who feel the need of a master. Hitler declared that the Geneva Conventions were not applicable to Slavs because they were subhumans, and German soldiers were thus permitted to ignore the Geneva Conventions in World War II with regard to Slavs. Hitler called Slavs a rabbit family meaning they were intrinsically idle and disorganized. Nazi Germany&#x27;s propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had media speak of Slavs as primitive animals who were from the Siberian tundra who were like a dark wave of filth. The Nazi notion of Slavs being inferior non-Aryans was part of the agenda for creating Lebensraum (living space) for Germans and other Germanic people in eastern Europe that was initiated during World War II under &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;: millions of Germans and other Germanic settlers would be moved into conquered territories of Eastern Europe, while the original Slavic inhabitants were to be annihilated, removed, or enslaved. Nazi Germany&#x27;s ally the Independent State of Croatia rejected the common conception that Croats were primarily a Slavic people and claimed that Croats were primarily the descendants of the Germanic Goths. However the Nazi regime continued to classify Croats as a subhuman in spite of the alliance. Nazi Germany&#x27;s policy changed towards Slavs in response to military manpower shortages, in which it accepted Slavs to serve in its armed forces within occupied territories, in spite of them being considered subhuman, as a pragmatic means to resolve such manpower shortages.

Shortly after the Nazis came to power in 1933 they passed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service law which required all civil servants to provide proof of their Aryan ancestry and defined non-Aryan as a person with one Jewish grandparent. In 1933, the German Interior Ministry official Albert Gorter drafted an official definition of the Aryan race for the new law which included all non-Jewish Europeans, this definition was unacceptable by the Nazis. However, Achim Gerke revised Gorter&#x27;s draft of the Civil Service Law classifying Aryans as people tribally related to German blood. The Nuremberg race laws of 1935 classified as racially acceptable people with German or related blood.

Hitler often doubted whether Czechs were Aryan or not, he said in his table talk, &quot;It is enough for a Czech to grow a moustache for anyone to see, from the way the thing droops, that his origin is Mongolian.&quot; The question of whether Italians were Aryan enough was questioned by the Nazi racial theorists. Hitler viewed northern Italians as strongly Aryan, but not southern Italians. The Nazis viewed the downfall of the Roman Empire as being the result of the pollution of blood from racial intermixing, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Hitler even mentioned his view of the presence of Negroid blood in the Mediterranean peoples during his first meeting with Mussolini in 1934. The definition of Aryan remained in constant flux to such an extent that the Nazis questioned whether European ethnic groups such as Finns or Hungarians were to be classified as Aryans. Hungarians were classified as tribally alien but not necessarily blood alien, in 1934 the Nazis published a pamphlet which declared Magyars (which it did not define) as Aryans. The following year, an article published by the Nazis admitted that there were disputes over the racial status of Hungarians. As late as 1943, there were disputes over whether Hungarians were to be classified as Aryan. In 1942, Hitler declared that the Finns were racially related Germanic neighboring peoples, although there is no evidence to suggest that this was based on anything racial.

The idea of the Northern origins of the Aryans was particularly influential in Germany. It was widely believed that the Vedic Aryans were ethnically identical to the Goths, Vandals and other ancient Germanic peoples of the &quot;Völkerwanderung&quot;. This idea was often intertwined with antisemitic ideas. The distinctions between the Aryan and Semitic peoples were based on the aforementioned linguistic and ethnic history. A complete, highly speculative theory of Aryan and anti-Semitic history can be found in Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s major work, &quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot;. Semitic peoples came to be seen as a foreign presence within Aryan societies, and the Semitic peoples were often pointed to as the cause of conversion and destruction of social order and values leading to culture and civilization&#x27;s downfall by proto-Nazi theorists such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain.

These and other ideas evolved into the Nazi use of the term Aryan race to refer to what they saw as being a superior race, which was narrowly defined by the Nazis as being identical with the Nordic race, followed by other sub-races of the Aryan race and excluding Slavs as non-Aryan. They worked to maintain the purity of this race through eugenics programs (including anti-miscegenation legislation, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and the mentally deficient, the execution of the institutionalized mentally ill as part of a euthanasia program).

Heinrich Himmler (the &quot;Reichsführer&quot; of the SS), the person ordered by Adolf Hitler to implement the Final Solution, or the Holocaust, told his personal masseur Felix Kersten that he always carried with him a copy of the ancient Aryan scripture, the Bhagavad Gita because it relieved him of guilt about what he was doing – he felt that like the warrior Arjuna, he was simply doing his duty without attachment to his actions.

===Italian Fascism and Aryanism===

In a 1921 speech in Bologna, Mussolini stated that fascism was born out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan and Mediterranean race. In this speech Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race, Aryan in the meaning of people of an Indo-European language and culture. Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations, and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors. While Italian Fascism based its conception of race on spiritual and cultural factors, Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically pure races existed though biology was still considered a relevant factor in race.

Italian Fascism strongly rejected the common Nordicist conception of the Aryan race that idealized pure Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes. The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean inferiority complex that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior. Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism. However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter-skinned peoples had been depigmented from a darker skin, this theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology. Anthropologist Carleton S. Coon in his work &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that the Nordic race&#x27;s light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.

In the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the Nazi Party in Germany and with dictator Adolf Hitler&#x27;s emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues. In 1934, in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism&#x27;s Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis&#x27; emphasizing of a common Nordic Germanic race was absurd, saying, &quot;A Germanic race does not exist. We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so.&quot; The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by prominent Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther in his book &quot;Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes&quot; (1922) (Racial Science of the German People), where Günther recognized Germans as being composed of five Aryan subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine, and East Baltic while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five subtypes.

By 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by Giulio Cogni. Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists. Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory. On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book &quot;Il Razzismo&quot; (1936). Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians. Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions. As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies. He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization. Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni&#x27;s work, however Cogni&#x27;s ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later.

In 1938 Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognize Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society. Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognized Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent. In a meeting with PNF members in June 1938, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism.

The Fascist regime began publication of the racialist magazine &quot;La Difesa della Razza&quot; in 1938. The Nordicist racial theorist Guido Landra took a major role in the early work of &quot;La Difesa&quot;, and published the &quot;Manifesto of Racial Scientists&quot; in the magazine in 1938. The &quot;Manifesto&quot; received substantial criticism, including its assertion of Italians being a pure race, as it was viewed as absurd. &quot;La Difesa&quot; published other theories that described long-term Nordic Aryan amongst Italians, such as the theory that in the Eneolithic age Nordic Aryans arrived to Italy. Many of the writers took up the traditional Nordicist claim that the decline and fall of the Roman Empire was due to the arrival of Semitic immigrants. &quot;La Difesa&quot;″s writers were divided on their claims that described how Italians extricated themselves from Semitic influence.

The Nordicist direction of Fascist racial policy was challenged in 1938 by a resurgence of the Mediterraneanist faction in the PNF. By 1939, the Mediterraneanists&#x27; advocacy of a nativist racial theory that rejected ascribing the achievements of the Italian people to Nordic peoples. This nativist racial policy was prominently promoted by Ugo Rellini. Rellini rejected the notion of large-scale invasions of Italy by Nordic Aryans in the Eneolithic age, and claimed that Italians were an indigenous people descended from the Cro-Magnons. Rellini claimed that Mediterranean and Nordic peoples arrived later and peacefully intermixed in small numbers with the indigenous Italian population.

In 1941 the PNF&#x27;s Mediterraneanists through the influence of Giacomo Acerbo put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race. However these efforts were challenged by Mussolini&#x27;s endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist Alberto Luchini as head of Italy&#x27;s Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested in Julius Evola&#x27;s spiritual Nordicism in late 1941. Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist &quot;Manifesto of the Racial Scientists&quot;. The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group, and condemned the &quot;Manifesto&quot; for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the &quot;Manifesto&quot; constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country. Furthermore, the Council denounced the &quot;Manifesto&quot; for implicitly crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the Lombards for having a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance. The Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the ancient Greeks and Romans in comparison with the ancient Germanic tribes made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Aryan Germans. The Council denounced the &quot;Manifesto&quot;″s Nordicist attitude towards Mediterraneans that it claimed was considering them as slaves and was a repudiation of the entire Italian civilization.

==Neo-Nazism and Aryanism==
Since the military defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies in 1945, some neo-Nazis have developed a more inclusive definition of &quot;Aryan&quot;, claiming that the peoples of Western Europe are the closest descendants of the ancient Aryans, with Nordic and Germanic peoples being the most &quot;racially pure.&quot;

According to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, many neo-Nazis want to establish an autocratic state modeled after Nazi Germany to be called the &quot;Western Imperium&quot;. It is believed that this proposed state would be able to attain world domination by combining the nuclear arsenals of the four major Aryan world powers, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia under a single military command.

This proposed state would be led by a &quot;Führer&quot;-like figure called the &quot;Vindex&quot;, and would include all areas inhabited by the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, as conceived by Neo-Nazis. Only those of the Aryan race would be full citizens of the state. The &quot;Western Imperium&quot; would embark on a vigorous and dynamic program of space exploration, followed by the creation by genetic engineering of a super race called Homo Galactica. The concept of the &quot;Western Imperium&quot; as outlined in the previous three sentences is based on the original concept of the &quot;Imperium&quot; as outlined in the 1947 book &quot;Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics&quot; by Francis Parker Yockey as further updated, extended and refined in the early 1990s in pamphlets published by David Myatt.

<doc id="529875" wikidata="Q6188014" url="?curid=529875" title="Jesuit High School (New Orleans)">
<text>Jesuit High School is a private, non-profit, Catholic college-preparatory high school (grades 8–12) for boys run by the USA Central and Southern Province of the Society of Jesus in Mid-City New Orleans, Louisiana.

Founded in 1847 as the College of the Immaculate Conception before taking on its current name in 1911, the school promotes itself as serving students of all religious faiths.

== Mission and philosophy ==
The mission of Jesuit High School is to develop student competence, conscience and compassion to be men of faith.

The Jesuit approach to education is based on tradition beginning with St. Ignatius Loyola, in 1540.

It begins with focus on student and their potential; a &quot;cura personalis&quot;.

Encourages personal excellence in all aspects of life, often called &quot;magis&quot;, meaning &quot;more&quot; or &quot;greater,&quot; to the rigor of intellectual exchange and the varied challenges the school poses to its students through its curriculum.

==History==

===Founding and early history===
The College of the Immaculate Conception was founded in 1847 and opened in 1849. It was both a secondary school and college, and both were located in the Faubourg Ste. Marie of New Orleans (now the New Orleans Central Business District), a block upriver from the French Quarter, at the corner of Baronne and Common Streets. The delayed start of the school&#x27;s first year came as a result of the spread of Yellow Fever, and the school&#x27;s founder, Jean Baptiste Maisonabe, S.J., himself fell victim to the disease. Maisonabe was succeeded by John Cambiaso, S.J., who largely responsible for the design of the Church of the Immaculate Conception.

The Church of the Immaculate Conception remains on the original campus and plays an active role in the Jesuit High School community today.

=== Move to Carrollton &amp; Banks ===
In 1911, the high school and college divisions were split, and the college division relocated to St. Charles Avenue, eventually becoming Loyola University New Orleans. The high school remained on Baronne Street until 1926, when it was moved to its current location at 4133 Banks Street in Mid-City.

Since 1926, several additions have been made to the campus. In 1953 a wing was added along Palmyra Street; the addition included an auditorium, the Chapel of the North American Martyrs, a cafeteria, a library, several classrooms, and a band room. A recreation center and gym was constructed on Banks Street across from the school in 1957 and provided facilities for the athletic teams and the physical education program.

A resource center, featuring the school&#x27;s library, additional classrooms, and science facilities was built in 1974. The area was upgraded again in 2001, when the Student Commons was constructed under the resource center with further renovations to the school following after Hurricane Katrina.

In 2012, John Ryan Stadium, a baseball and multi-purpose sports stadium, was constructed at 100 Blue Jay Way in Metairie, LA, marking the school&#x27;s expansion into Jefferson Parish.

===Recent leadership===

In recent times, Fr. Raymond Fitzgerald, S.J., (Class of 1976) served as school president and was succeeded by 1966 graduate Fr. Anthony McGinn, S.J. In May 2015 it was announced that Fr. Chris Fronk, S.J., on active duty as a U.S. Navy chaplain, would serve as the school&#x27;s 30th president, and he assumed office in November 2016. In January 2020, Fr. Chris Fronk, S.J., stepped down from school president. Fr. John Brown, S.J., who is currently the school&#x27;s president, took over the role in 2020, becoming the school&#x27;s 31st president.

The principal is Peter Kernion (Class of 1990).

===Mascot, colors, and logo===
The mascot is a blue jay posed with his fists raised, designed by cartoonist Walt Kelly of Pogo fame. A contest among students was held to name the mascot in 1954, and the name &quot;Jayson&quot; won.

The school&#x27;s colors are blue and white to honor the Virgin Mary. Student athletes wore a white sweater with a blue letter &quot;J&quot; on it and were referred to as the &quot;Blue Js&quot;—hence the eventual selection of the mascot. As with many Jesuit schools, the school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam&quot; (&quot;For the Greater Glory of God&quot;).



==Athletics==
Jesuit athletics competes in the LHSAA.

===Athletic history===
Since 1933, Jesuit has won numerous state championships in football, basketball, baseball, wrestling, and soccer. The 1946 athletic year yielded undefeated state champions in baseball, basketball, track and field, and football—all coached by G. Gernon Brown. It has been said that Jesuit had &quot;All the Tricks in &#x27;46.&quot;

In the 2004–2005 school year, Jesuit won state championships in baseball, cross country, soccer, tennis, wrestling, rugby, and swimming, and went to the state playoffs in football with an undefeated regular season. In 2012 Jesuit built Ryan stadium, a state of the art facility accommodating football, baseball, and soccer on a field covered entirely with artificial turf. In 2015, Jesuit was the first prep school in the States to get a germ-zapping robot, gift of an alumnus.

=== Baseball ===
From 2007–09 Jesuit made it to the state tournament three times, and twice to the American Legion playoffs winning one championship. In August 2012, Jesuit&#x27;s baseball team won the American Legion World Series. Jesuit&#x27;s American Legion teams also won the national championship in 1946 and 1960. Jesuit won the Louisiana State High School Athletic Association Division I state championship in 2021 and again in 2023.

=== Basketball ===
In February 1965, Jesuit&#x27;s all-white basketball team played a secret game against St. Augustine, the city&#x27;s all-male, all-black high school. The Purple Knights won the game, which was the basis for the 1999 motion picture Passing Glory. That same year, Jesuit won the 1965 Louisiana High School Athletic Association state championship in Class AAA (at the time the state&#x27;s highest classification) while St. Augustine won the championship of the Louisiana Interscholastic and Literary Organization, the sanctioning body for the state&#x27;s black schools. In the fall of 1967, St. Augustine joined the LHSAA and became a rival for the Blue Jays in the New Orleans Catholic League through the 2010–11 school year, when the Purple Knights were reclassified Class 4A by the LHSAA. In the 2013-14 school year, the Purple Knights were reclassified back up to Class 5A by the LHSAA.

=== Cross-Country ===
In 2005, Jesuit became the first 5A school in Louisiana history to win three state championships in a row in the sport of cross country. In 2006 they continued with an unprecedented 4th cross country state championship.

=== Football ===
In football, Jesuit High School vs. Holy Cross High School is the oldest continuous high school rivalry in Louisiana and one of the oldest continuous high school football rivalries in the United States. The first game was played in 1922 (Jesuit won by 52–0) and the two teams have played every year since (twice in 1963 and 2023: in 1963 once in regular season and another time for the state crown which Holy Cross won and in 2023 once in regular season and another time in the state playoffs which Holy Cross won) Blue Jays vs. Tigers.

Jesuit has won eight football state championships in 1933, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1953, 1960, and 2014. 
The Jesuit football team played for a state championship during the 2014 season against the John Curtis Patriots. It was the Blue Jays&#x27; first championship game appearance since 1978 against St. Augustine. Jesuit defeated John Curtis 17–14 to win the Division 1 state championship. Running back Charles Jackson was voted the game&#x27;s most valuable player.

=== Golf ===
Jesuit won the state championship twice in the late 1990s. 
=== Lacrosse ===
In 2014, Jesuit New Orleans won the 2014 Allstate Sugar Bowl Lacrosse Classic, with 14 schools competing from Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. In 2021, the Lacrosse team won the Louisiana High School Lacrosse state championship after completing an undefeated season.

=== Rugby ===
In the 2007–2008 season, the rugby team won the State Championship for the sixth consecutive year with an undefeated season, only allowing 12 points while scoring over 300. Because of a conflict with the senior prom, the team was forced to play in the more difficult multi-school division at the Southern Regionals in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The team swept regionals and moved on to become 8th in the country in the multi-school division at the USA Rugby Boys High School National Championship. In 2017, the Blue Jays reclaimed the State Championship, winning the title for the first time since 2011, with an overtime victory over the Bayou Hurricanes, 25–22. In 2018, the Blue Jays remained the State Champions with a victory over the Brother Martin Crusaders, 22–12.

=== Soccer ===
In the 1998–1999 season, 2006–2007 season, 2008–2009 season, and also the 2009–2010 season, Jesuit fielded one of the best soccer teams in the nation, winning the Louisiana state title and in all four cases ending the season undefeated. This record gave the Jesuit team a #3 (1998–99), a #2 (2006–2007), a #1 (2008–2009), and a #3 (2009–2010) rank in the nation. The 2008–2009 team is considered the best high school soccer team in LHSAA history. In the three seasons from 2009–2011, the soccer team had a 94-game unbeaten streak, which is the fourth longest unbeaten streak in the country. Jesuit won additional soccer state championships in 2018 and 2024.

=== Swimming ===
Jesuit swimming holds the LHSAA record for most consecutive state championships in any sport, with 18 straight. As of November 20, 2010, Jesuit Swimming has captured 36 state championships. The streak was broken in 2005 when the team, still feeling the effects of Hurricane Katrina, was only able to field 12 swimmers, yet managed to take second place, only a few points out of first. In 2006, however, the team was able to recapture the state championship.

=== Wrestling ===
In wrestling within the state of Louisiana, Jesuit&#x27;s rival Holy Cross was the perennial state champs under Br. Melchior Polowy in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Then in 1969 Jesuit hired Surachai &quot;Sam&quot; Harnsongkram as its new wrestling coach. In 1972 the Jesuit High School Blue Jays won the first of 18 State Championships under Coach Sam, including 11 in a row from 1988–1998. Prior to that 1972 win, Jesuit&#x27;s only state championship was in 1951. And since that string-of-11 (ending in 1998) Jesuit has won 4 more state wrestling championships, with the last being in 2009. High School wrestling in Louisiana has become much more visible starting in the 1990s, resulting in other schools developing programs to challenge the &quot;leaders&quot;. From 1999-til-2015, Jesuit has won 4 more state championships, and has been runner-up in the other years. Jesuit won the Louisiana Division I wrestling championship in 2024.

==Hurricane Katrina==

When the flooding following Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, Jesuit High School was inundated, five feet (1.5 m) of water ruining the ground floor. When the school announced that it was closed indefinitely, many students enrolled in schools in cities where they had evacuated. The largest concentration of students attended a satellite school at Strake Jesuit College Preparatory in Houston; at one point, approximately 420 displaced students attended classes at night with their own teachers and classmates. In mid-October, Jesuit opened another satellite school at St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal School in Metairie in unincorporated Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, where about 500 students attended until Thanksgiving. After Thanksgiving, Jesuit&#x27;s students and faculty returned to their own campus, becoming the first flooded school in New Orleans to reopen – albeit with an unusable first floor. The school held its annual Thanksgiving Drive for the poor living in the surrounding neighborhoods. On 23 January 2006, 1285 of the 1450 students returned to attend Jesuit for the second semester. After the Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017, Jesuit hosted students from Colegio San Ignacio in Puerto Rico.

==History of sexual abuse==
There have been several instances of child sexual abuse at the school. The Jesuit order confirmed that at least fourteen clergy assigned to Jesuit High at some point in their careers were credibly accused of sexual abuse. The accused clergy were active from the 1950s through the 1990s, and almost all were dead by 2018. Several other priests and employees at the school have also been confirmed by the administration as abusers, and the school has allegedly paid large settlements to the families.

In 2018 the president of Jesuit High School said that he was &quot;horrified&quot; by the sexual abuse at the school dating back to the &quot;disgusting time in our history&quot; of the 1970s.

<text>Agostino Todaro (14 January 1818 – 18 April 1892) was an Italian botanist.

He was born and died in Palermo, Italy. He was a professor of botany and became the director of the botanical gardens in Palermo. Starting with 1864 he edited the exsiccata &quot;Flora Sicula exsiccata&quot;. Todaro published the &quot;Hortus Botanicus Panormitanus&quot; in 1876–1878.

In 1843, botanist Filippo Parlatore published &quot;Todaroa&quot;, which is a genus of flowering plants from the Canary Islands, belonging to the family Apiaceae. It just contains one known species, Todaroa aurea , and it is named after Agostino Todaro.

The standard botanical author abbreviation Tod. is applied to species he described.

<text>Sir John Middleton, (1870 – 5 November 1954) was a British colonial administrator.

Middleton joined the Colonial Office in 1901, serving in south Nigeria for six years as a junior official before moving on to Mauritius until 1920 when he was promoted to governor of the Falkland Islands from 1920 to 1927, Gambia from 1927 to 1928 and Newfoundland from 1928 to 1932.

He was Governor of Newfoundland during a period of acute political crisis that was exacerbated by the Great Depression. In 1932, he was asked to investigate allegations that the Prime Minister of Newfoundland, Sir Richard Squires had falsified cabinet minutes in an attempt to coverup evidence of corruption involving his government. Middleton&#x27;s conclusions that there was no sign of tampering resulted in a riot outside his office on 5 April 1932 that helped bring down the Squires government. Middleton retired from public life following his term in Newfoundland and returned to England.

<text>Ventilation is the intentional introduction of outdoor air into a space. Ventilation is mainly used to control indoor air quality by diluting and displacing indoor effluents and pollutants. It can also be used to control indoor temperature, humidity, and air motion to benefit thermal comfort, satisfaction with other aspects of the indoor environment, or other objectives.

The intentional introduction of outdoor air is usually categorized as either mechanical ventilation, natural ventilation, or mixed-mode ventilation.
* Mechanical ventilation is the intentional fan-driven flow of outdoor air into and/or out from a building. Mechanical ventilation systems may include supply fans (which push outdoor air into a building), exhaust fans (which draw air out of a building and thereby cause equal ventilation flow into a building), or a combination of both (called balanced ventilation if it neither pressurizes nor depressurizes the inside air, or only slightly depressurizes it). Mechanical ventilation is often provided by equipment that is also used to heat and cool a space.
* Natural ventilation is the intentional passive flow of outdoor air into a building through planned openings (such as louvers, doors, and windows). Natural ventilation does not require mechanical systems to move outdoor air. Instead, it relies entirely on passive physical phenomena, such as wind pressure, or the stack effect. Natural ventilation openings may be fixed, or adjustable. Adjustable openings may be controlled automatically (automated), owned by occupants (operable), or a combination of both. Cross ventilation is a phenomenon of natural ventilation.
* Mixed-mode ventilation systems use both mechanical and natural processes. The mechanical and natural components may be used at the same time, at different times of day, or in different seasons of the year. Since natural ventilation flow depends on environmental conditions, it may not always provide an appropriate amount of ventilation. In this case, mechanical systems may be used to supplement or regulate the naturally driven flow.

Ventilation is typically described as separate from infiltration.

* Infiltration is the circumstantial flow of air from outdoors to indoors through leaks (unplanned openings) in a building envelope. When a building design relies on infiltration to maintain indoor air quality, this flow has been referred to as adventitious ventilation.

The design of buildings that promote occupant health and well-being requires a clear understanding of the ways that ventilation airflow interacts with, dilutes, displaces, or introduces pollutants within the occupied space. Although ventilation is an integral component of maintaining good indoor air quality, it may not be satisfactory alone. A clear understanding of both indoor and outdoor air quality parameters is needed to improve the performance of ventilation in terms of occupant health and energy. In scenarios where outdoor pollution would deteriorate indoor air quality, other treatment devices such as filtration may also be necessary. In kitchen ventilation systems, or for laboratory fume hoods, the design of effective effluent capture can be more important than the bulk amount of ventilation in a space. More generally, the way that an air distribution system causes ventilation to flow into and out of a space impacts the ability of a particular ventilation rate to remove internally generated pollutants. The ability of a system to reduce pollution in space is described as its &quot;ventilation effectiveness&quot;. However, the overall impacts of ventilation on indoor air quality can depend on more complex factors such as the sources of pollution, and the ways that activities and airflow interact to affect occupant exposure.

An array of factors related to the design and operation of ventilation systems are regulated by various codes and standards. Standards dealing with the design and operation of ventilation systems to achieve acceptable indoor air quality include the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards 62.1 and 62.2, the International Residential Code, the International Mechanical Code, and the United Kingdom Building Regulations Part F. Other standards that focus on energy conservation also impact the design and operation of ventilation systems, including ASHRAE Standard 90.1, and the International Energy Conservation Code.

When indoor and outdoor conditions are favorable, increasing ventilation beyond the minimum required for indoor air quality can significantly improve both indoor air quality and thermal comfort through ventilative cooling, which also helps reduce the energy demand of buildings. During these times, higher ventilation rates, achieved through passive or mechanical means (air-side economizer, ventilative pre-cooling), can be particularly beneficial for enhancing people&#x27;s physical health. Conversely, when conditions are less favorable, maintaining or improving indoor air quality through ventilation may require increased use of mechanical heating or cooling, leading to higher energy consumption.

Ventilation should be considered for its relationship to &quot;venting&quot; for appliances and combustion equipment such as water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and wood stoves. Most importantly, building ventilation design must be careful to avoid the backdraft of combustion products from &quot;naturally vented&quot; appliances into the occupied space. This issue is of greater importance for buildings with more air-tight envelopes. To avoid the hazard, many modern combustion appliances utilize &quot;direct venting&quot; which draws combustion air directly from outdoors, instead of from the indoor environment.

== Design of air flow in rooms ==
The air in a room can be supplied and removed in several ways, for example via ceiling ventilation, cross ventilation, floor ventilation or displacement ventilation.

Furthermore, the air can be circulated in the room using vortexes which can be initiated in various ways:

== Ventilation rates for indoor air quality ==

The ventilation rate, for commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) buildings, is normally expressed by the volumetric flow rate of outdoor air, introduced to the building. The typical units used are cubic feet per minute (CFM) in the imperial system, or liters per second (L/s) in the metric system (even though cubic meter per second is the preferred unit for volumetric flow rate in the SI system of units). The ventilation rate can also be expressed on a per person or per unit floor area basis, such as CFM/p or CFM/ft², or as air changes per hour (ACH).

=== Standards for residential buildings ===
For residential buildings, which mostly rely on infiltration for meeting their ventilation needs, a common ventilation rate measure is the air change rate (or air changes per hour): the hourly ventilation rate divided by the volume of the space (&quot;I&quot; or &quot;ACH&quot;; units of 1/h). During the winter, ACH may range from 0.50 to 0.41 in a tightly air-sealed house to 1.11 to 1.47 in a loosely air-sealed house.

ASHRAE now recommends ventilation rates dependent upon floor area, as a revision to the 62-2001 standard, in which the minimum ACH was 0.35, but no less than 15 CFM/person (7.1 L/s/person). As of 2003, the standard has been changed to 3 CFM/100 sq. ft. (15 L/s/100 sq. m.) plus 7.5 CFM/person (3.5 L/s/person).

=== Standards for commercial buildings ===
=== Ventilation rate procedure ===
Ventilation Rate Procedure is rate based on standard and prescribes the rate at which ventilation air must be delivered to space and various means to the condition that air. Air quality is assessed (through CO2 measurement) and ventilation rates are mathematically derived using constants.Indoor Air Quality Procedure uses one or more guidelines for the specification of acceptable concentrations of certain contaminants in indoor air but does not prescribe ventilation rates or air treatment methods. This addresses both quantitative and subjective evaluations and is based on the Ventilation Rate Procedure. It also accounts for potential contaminants that may have no measured limits, or for which no limits are not set (such as formaldehyde off-gassing from carpet and furniture).

== Natural ventilation ==

Natural ventilation harnesses naturally available forces to supply and remove air in an enclosed space. Poor ventilation in rooms is identified to significantly increase the localized moldy smell in specific places of the room including room corners. There are three types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: wind-driven ventilation, pressure-driven flows, and stack ventilation. The pressures generated by &#x27;the stack effect&#x27; rely upon the buoyancy of heated or rising air. Wind-driven ventilation relies upon the force of the prevailing wind to pull and push air through the enclosed space as well as through breaches in the building&#x27;s envelope.

Almost all historic buildings were ventilated naturally. The technique was generally abandoned in larger US buildings during the late 20th century as the use of air conditioning became more widespread. However, with the advent of advanced Building Performance Simulation (BPS) software, improved Building Automation Systems (BAS), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) design requirements, and improved window manufacturing techniques; natural ventilation has made a resurgence in commercial buildings both globally and throughout the US.

The benefits of natural ventilation include:

*Improved indoor air quality (IAQ)
*Energy savings
*Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
*Occupant control
*Reduction in occupant illness associated with sick building syndrome
*Increased worker productivity

Techniques and architectural features used to ventilate buildings and structures naturally include, but are not limited to:

*Operable windows
*Clerestory windows and vented skylights
*Lev/convection doors
*Night purge ventilation
*Building orientation
*Wind capture façades

==Airborne diseases==
Natural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza, meningitis or COVID-19. Opening doors and windows are good ways to maximize natural ventilation, which would make the risk of airborne contagion much lower than with costly and maintenance-requiring mechanical systems. Old-fashioned clinical areas with high ceilings and large windows provide the greatest protection. Natural ventilation costs little and is maintenance-free, and is particularly suited to limited-resource settings and tropical climates, where the burden of TB and institutional TB transmission is highest. In settings where respiratory isolation is difficult and climate permits, windows and doors should be opened to reduce the risk of airborne contagion. Natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive.

Natural ventilation is not practical in much of the infrastructure because of climate. This means that the facilities need to have effective mechanical ventilation systems and or use Ceiling Level UV or FAR UV ventilation systems.

Ventilation is measured in terms of air changes per hour (ACH). , the CDC recommends that all spaces have a minimum of 5 ACH. For hospital rooms with airborne contagions the CDC recommends a minimum of 12 ACH. Challenges in facility ventilation are public unawareness, ineffective government oversight, poor building codes that are based on comfort levels, poor system operations, poor maintenance, and lack of transparency. 

Pressure, both political and economic, to improve energy conservation has led to decreased ventilation rates. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning rates have dropped since the energy crisis in the 1970s and the banning of cigarette smoke in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Mechanical ventilation ==

Mechanical ventilation of buildings and structures can be achieved by the use of the following techniques:

*Whole-house ventilation
*Mixing ventilation
*Displacement ventilation
*Dedicated subaerial air supply

=== Demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) ===
Demand-controlled ventilation (DCV, also known as Demand Control Ventilation) makes it possible to maintain air quality while conserving energy. ASHRAE has determined that &quot;It is consistent with the ventilation rate procedure that demand control be permitted for use to reduce the total outdoor air supply during periods of less occupancy.&quot; In a DCV system, CO2 sensors control the amount of ventilation. During peak occupancy, CO2 levels rise, and the system adjusts to deliver the same amount of outdoor air as would be used by the ventilation-rate procedure. However, when spaces are less occupied, CO2 levels reduce, and the system reduces ventilation to conserves energy. DCV is a well-established practice, and is required in high occupancy spaces by building energy standards such as ASHRAE 90.1.

=== Personalized ventilation ===

Personalized ventilation is an air distribution strategy that allows individuals to control the amount of ventilation received. The approach delivers fresh air more directly to the breathing zone and aims to improve the air quality of inhaled air. Personalized ventilation provides much higher ventilation effectiveness than conventional mixing ventilation systems by displacing pollution from the breathing zone with far less air volume. Beyond improved air quality benefits, the strategy can also improve occupants&#x27; thermal comfort, perceived air quality, and overall satisfaction with the indoor environment. Individuals&#x27; preferences for temperature and air movement are not equal, and so traditional approaches to homogeneous environmental control have failed to achieve high occupant satisfaction. Techniques such as personalized ventilation facilitate control of a more diverse thermal environment that can improve thermal satisfaction for most occupants.

=== Local exhaust ventilation ===

Local exhaust ventilation addresses the issue of avoiding the contamination of indoor air by specific high-emission sources by capturing airborne contaminants before they are spread into the environment. This can include water vapor control, lavatory effluent control, solvent vapors from industrial processes, and dust from wood- and metal-working machinery. Air can be exhausted through pressurized hoods or the use of fans and pressurizing a specific area.A local exhaust system is composed of five basic parts:

# A hood that captures the contaminant at its source
# Ducts for transporting the air
# An air-cleaning device that removes/minimizes the contaminant
# A fan that moves the air through the system
# An exhaust stack through which the contaminated air is discharged

In the UK, the use of LEV systems has regulations set out by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) which are referred to as the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (CoSHH). Under CoSHH, legislation is set to protect users of LEV systems by ensuring that all equipment is tested at least every fourteen months to ensure the LEV systems are performing adequately. All parts of the system must be visually inspected and thoroughly tested and where any parts are found to be defective, the inspector must issue a red label to identify the defective part and the issue.

The owner of the LEV system must then have the defective parts repaired or replaced before the system can be used.

== Smart ventilation ==
Smart ventilation is a process of continually adjusting the ventilation system in time, and optionally by location, to provide the desired IAQ benefits while minimizing energy consumption, utility bills, and other non-IAQ costs (such as thermal discomfort or noise).
A smart ventilation system adjusts ventilation rates in time or by location in a building to be responsive to one or more of the following: occupancy, outdoor thermal and air quality conditions, electricity grid needs, direct sensing of contaminants, operation of other air moving and air cleaning systems. In addition, smart ventilation systems can provide information to building owners, occupants, and managers on operational energy consumption and indoor air quality as well as a signal when systems need maintenance or repair.
Being responsive to occupancy means that a smart ventilation system can adjust ventilation depending on demand such as reducing ventilation if the building is unoccupied. Smart ventilation can time-shift ventilation to periods when a) indoor-outdoor temperature differences are smaller (and away from peak outdoor temperatures and humidity), b) when indoor-outdoor temperatures are appropriate for ventilative cooling, or c) when outdoor air quality is acceptable.
Being responsive to electricity grid needs means providing flexibility to electricity demand (including direct signals from utilities) and integration with electric grid control strategies.
Smart ventilation systems can have sensors to detect airflow, systems pressures, or fan energy use in such a way that systems failures can be detected and repaired, as well as when system components need maintenance, such as filter replacement.

== Ventilation and combustion ==

Combustion (in a fireplace, gas heater, candle, oil lamp, etc.) consumes oxygen while producing carbon dioxide and other unhealthy gases and smoke, requiring ventilation air. An open chimney promotes infiltration (i.e. natural ventilation) because of the negative pressure change induced by the buoyant, warmer air leaving through the chimney. The warm air is typically replaced by heavier, cold air.

Ventilation in a structure is also needed for removing water vapor produced by respiration, burning, and cooking, and for removing odors. If water vapor is permitted to accumulate, it may damage the structure, insulation, or finishes. When operating, an air conditioner usually removes excess moisture from the air. A dehumidifier may also be appropriate for removing airborne moisture.

== Calculation for acceptable ventilation rate ==
Ventilation guidelines are based on the minimum ventilation rate required to maintain acceptable levels of effluents. Carbon dioxide is used as a reference point, as it is the gas of highest emission at a relatively constant value of 0.005 L/s. The mass balance equation is:

Q = G/ (Ci − Ca)

*Q = ventilation rate (L/s)
*G = CO2 generation rate
*Ci = acceptable indoor CO2 concentration
*Ca = ambient CO2 concentration

== Smoking and ventilation ==
ASHRAE standard 62 states that air removed from an area with environmental tobacco smoke shall not be recirculated into ETS-free air. A space with ETS requires more ventilation to achieve similar perceived air quality to that of a non-smoking environment.

The amount of ventilation in an ETS area is equal to the amount of an ETS-free area plus the amount V, where:

V = DSD × VA × A/60E

*V = recommended extra flow rate in CFM (L/s)
*DSD = design smoking density (estimated number of cigarettes smoked per hour per unit area)
*VA = volume of ventilation air per cigarette for the room being designed (ft3/cig)
*E = contaminant removal effectiveness

== History ==

Primitive ventilation systems were found at the Pločnik archeological site (belonging to the Vinča culture) in Serbia and were built into early copper smelting furnaces. The furnace, built on the outside of the workshop, featured earthen pipe-like air vents with hundreds of tiny holes in them and a prototype chimney to ensure air goes into the furnace to feed the fire and smoke comes out safely.

Passive ventilation and passive cooling systems were widely written about around the Mediterranean by Classical times. Both sources of heat and sources of cooling (such as fountains and subterranean heat reservoirs) were used to drive air circulation, and buildings were designed to encourage or exclude drafts, according to climate and function. Public bathhouses were often particularly sophisticated in their heating and cooling. Icehouses are some millennia old, and were part of a well-developed ice industry by classical times.

The development of forced ventilation was spurred by the common belief in the late 18th and early 19th century in the miasma theory of disease, where stagnant &#x27;airs&#x27; were thought to spread illness. An early method of ventilation was the use of a ventilating fire near an air vent which would forcibly cause the air in the building to circulate. English engineer John Theophilus Desaguliers provided an early example of this when he installed ventilating fires in the air tubes on the roof of the House of Commons. Starting with the Covent Garden Theatre, gas burning chandeliers on the ceiling were often specially designed to perform a ventilating role.

=== Mechanical systems ===

A more sophisticated system involving the use of mechanical equipment to circulate the air was developed in the mid-19th century. A basic system of bellows was put in place to ventilate Newgate Prison and outlying buildings, by the engineer Stephen Hales in the mid-1700s. The problem with these early devices was that they required constant human labor to operate. David Boswell Reid was called to testify before a Parliamentary committee on proposed architectural designs for the new House of Commons, after the old one burned down in a fire in 1834. In January 1840 Reid was appointed by the committee for the House of Lords dealing with the construction of the replacement for the Houses of Parliament. The post was in the capacity of ventilation engineer, in effect; and with its creation there began a long series of quarrels between Reid and Charles Barry, the architect.

Reid advocated the installation of a very advanced ventilation system in the new House. His design had air being drawn into an underground chamber, where it would undergo either heating or cooling. It would then ascend into the chamber through thousands of small holes drilled into the floor, and would be extracted through the ceiling by a special ventilation fire within a great stack.

Reid&#x27;s reputation was made by his work in Westminster. He was commissioned for an air quality survey in 1837 by the Leeds and Selby Railway in their tunnel. The steam vessels built for the Niger expedition of 1841 were fitted with ventilation systems based on Reid&#x27;s Westminster model. Air was dried, filtered and passed over charcoal. Reid&#x27;s ventilation method was also applied more fully to St. George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool, where the architect, Harvey Lonsdale Elmes, requested that Reid should be involved in ventilation design. Reid considered this the only building in which his system was completely carried out.

=== Fans ===
With the advent of practical steam power, ceiling fans could finally be used for ventilation. Reid installed four steam-powered fans in the ceiling of St George&#x27;s Hospital in Liverpool, so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling. Reid&#x27;s pioneering work provides the basis for ventilation systems to this day. He was remembered as &quot;Dr. Reid the ventilator&quot; in the twenty-first century in discussions of energy efficiency, by Lord Wade of Chorlton.

=== History and development of ventilation rate standards ===

Ventilating a space with fresh air aims to avoid &quot;bad air&quot;. The study of what constitutes bad air dates back to the 1600s when the scientist Mayow studied asphyxia of animals in confined bottles. The poisonous component of air was later identified as carbon dioxide (), by Lavoisier in the very late 1700s, starting a debate as to the nature of &quot;bad air&quot; which humans perceive to be stuffy or unpleasant. Early hypotheses included excess concentrations of and oxygen depletion. However, by the late 1800s, scientists thought biological contamination, not oxygen or , was the primary component of unacceptable indoor air. However, it was noted as early as 1872 that concentration closely correlates to perceived air quality.

The first estimate of minimum ventilation rates was developed by Tredgold in 1836. This was followed by subsequent studies on the topic by Billings in 1886 and Flugge in 1905. The recommendations of Billings and Flugge were incorporated into numerous building codes from 1900–the 1920s and published as an industry standard by ASHVE (the predecessor to ASHRAE) in 1914.

The study continued into the varied effects of thermal comfort, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and biological contaminants. The research was conducted with human subjects in controlled test chambers. Two studies, published between 1909 and 1911, showed that carbon dioxide was not the offending component. Subjects remained satisfied in chambers with high levels of , so long as the chamber remained cool. (Subsequently, it has been determined that is, in fact, harmful at concentrations over 50,000ppm)

ASHVE began a robust research effort in 1919. By 1935, ASHVE-funded research conducted by Lemberg, Brandt, and Morse – again using human subjects in test chambers – suggested the primary component of &quot;bad air&quot; was an odor, perceived by the human olfactory nerves. Human response to odor was found to be logarithmic to contaminant concentrations, and related to temperature. At lower, more comfortable temperatures, lower ventilation rates were satisfactory. A 1936 human test chamber study by Yaglou, Riley, and Coggins culminated much of this effort, considering odor, room volume, occupant age, cooling equipment effects, and recirculated air implications, which guided ventilation rates. The Yagle research has been validated, and adopted into industry standards, beginning with the ASA code in 1946. From this research base, ASHRAE (having replaced ASHVE) developed space-by-space recommendations, and published them as ASHRAE Standard 62-1975: Ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality.

As more architecture incorporated mechanical ventilation, the cost of outdoor air ventilation came under some scrutiny. In 1973, in response to the 1973 oil crisis and conservation concerns, ASHRAE Standards 62-73 and 62–81) reduced required ventilation from 10 CFM (4.76 L/s) per person to 5 CFM (2.37 L/s) per person. In cold, warm, humid, or dusty climates, it is preferable to minimize ventilation with outdoor air to conserve energy, cost, or filtration. This critique (e.g. Tiller) led ASHRAE to reduce outdoor ventilation rates in 1981, particularly in non-smoking areas. However subsequent research by Fanger, W. Cain, and Janssen validated the Yagle model. The reduced ventilation rates were found to be a contributing factor to sick building syndrome.
The 1989 ASHRAE standard (Standard 62–89) states that appropriate ventilation guidelines are 20 CFM (9.2 L/s) per person in an office building, and 15 CFM (7.1 L/s) per person for schools, while 2004 Standard 62.1-2004 has lower recommendations again (see tables below). ANSI/ASHRAE (Standard 62–89) speculated that &quot;comfort (odor) criteria are likely to be satisfied if the ventilation rate is set so that 1,000 ppm CO2 is not exceeded&quot; while OSHA has set a limit of 5000 ppm over 8 hours.

ASHRAE continues to publish space-by-space ventilation rate recommendations, which are decided by a consensus committee of industry experts. The modern descendants of ASHRAE standard 62-1975 are ASHRAE Standard 62.1, for non-residential spaces, and ASHRAE 62.2 for residences.

In 2004, the calculation method was revised to include both an occupant-based contamination component and an area–based contamination component. These two components are additive, to arrive at an overall ventilation rate. The change was made to recognize that densely populated areas were sometimes overventilated (leading to higher energy and cost) using a per-person methodology.
Occupant Based Ventilation Rates, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004

Area-based ventilation rates, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004

The addition of occupant- and area-based ventilation rates found in the tables above often results in significantly reduced rates compared to the former standard. This is compensated in other sections of the standard which require that this minimum amount of air is delivered to the breathing zone of the individual occupant at all times. The total outdoor air intake of the ventilation system (in multiple-zone variable air volume (VAV) systems) might therefore be similar to the airflow required by the 1989 standard. 
From 1999 to 2010, there was considerable development of the application protocol for ventilation rates. These advancements address occupant- and process-based ventilation rates, room ventilation effectiveness, and system ventilation effectiveness

== Problems ==
* In hot, humid climates, unconditioned ventilation air can daily deliver approximately 260 milliliters of water for each cubic meters per hour (m3/h) of outdoor air (or one pound of water each day for each cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per day), annual average. This is a great deal of moisture and can create serious indoor moisture and mold problems. For example, given a 150 m2 building with an airflow of 180 m3/h this could result in about 47 liters of water accumulated per day.
* Ventilation efficiency is determined by design and layout, and is dependent upon the placement and proximity of diffusers and return air outlets. If they are located closely together, supply air may mix with stale air, decreasing the efficiency of the HVAC system, and creating air quality problems.
* System imbalances occur when components of the HVAC system are improperly adjusted or installed and can create pressure differences (too much-circulating air creating a draft or too little circulating air creating stagnancy).
* Cross-contamination occurs when pressure differences arise, forcing potentially contaminated air from one zone to an uncontaminated zone. This often involves undesired odors or VOCs.
* Re-entry of exhaust air occurs when exhaust outlets and fresh air intakes are either too close, prevailing winds change exhaust patterns or infiltration between intake and exhaust air flows.
* Entrainment of contaminated outdoor air through intake flows will result in indoor air contamination. There are a variety of contaminated air sources, ranging from industrial effluent to VOCs put off by nearby construction work. A recent study revealed that in urban European buildings equipped with ventilation systems lacking outdoor air filtration, the exposure to outdoor-originating pollutants indoors resulted in more Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) than exposure to indoor-emitted pollutants.

<text>Ahmed Ben Messali Hadj (May 16, 1898 – June 3, 1974; commonly known as Messali Hadj, ) was an Algerian nationalist politician dedicated to the independence of his homeland from French colonial rule. He is often called the &quot;father&quot; of Algerian nationalism.

He co-founded the &quot;Étoile nord-africaine&quot;, and founded the &quot;Parti du peuple algérien&quot; and the &quot;Mouvement pour le triomphe des libertés démocratiques&quot; before dissociating himself from the armed struggle for Independence in 1954. He also founded the &quot;Mouvement national algérien&quot; to counteract the ongoing efforts of the &quot;Front de libération nationale&quot;.

== Early life ==

Ahmed Ben Messali Hadj was born in Tlemcen in 1898. His father Hadj Ahmed Messali was of Turkish origin and his mother Ftéma Sari Ali Hadj-Eddine belonged to a family of seven daughters, raised in Muslim traditions by their father, a qadi, a member of the Darqawiyya brotherhood. He was educated in a local French primary school and also received a religious education influenced by the Darqawiyya Sufi order.

Messali Hadj served in the French army from 1918 to 1921; having trained in Bordeaux and then promoted as sergeant in 1919. By October 1923, at the age of 25, Messali Hadj went to Paris to find work; upon his arrival, he sold bonnets and Tlemceni handicrafts, and he also enrolled in Arabic-language university courses. During his time in Paris, Messali Hadj met his French wife, Émilie Busquant, a worker revolutionary’s daughter. His time in Paris also corresponded with the first meetings of Maghribi workers in France which called for the independence of all colonies. Abdelkader Hadj Ali recruited Messali Hadj to the French Communist Party (PCF) colonial commission in 1925.

== Political career ==

=== Founding of nationalist organisations ===

In 1926 Messali Hadj founded the &quot;Étoile Nord-Africaine&quot; (ENA). Consequently, he became one of the most prominent Algerian nationalists seeking to remove all French forces and to end French colonial rule in Algeria. Messali Hadj went to Brussels in 1927 to outline the ENA’s demands for the abolition of the &quot;Indigénat&quot; and amnesty for all those convicted under it; moreover, he listed several other demands including: the right to form trade unions, education for all, and social welfare and representational legislation. By 1929 the ENA was banned in France once its links with the French Communist Party were severed. Thereafter, Messali Hadj rebranded the ENA several times in the 1930s and 1940s; hence, he would find himself frequently jailed or exiled.

By 1935 Messali Hadj had reorganised the &quot;Glorieuse Étoile Nord-Africaine&quot; (ENA) party and distanced it from the French communists by presenting it as an Algerian nationalist organisation describing it as an &quot;Union Nationale des Musulmans Nord-Africains&quot;. However, whilst he was in temporary exile in Geneva, Switzerland, Messali Hadj met Shakib Arslan and reoriented from Marxism to Pan-Arabism and Islamism. Consequently, Messali Hadj reorganised his nationalist movement as the &quot;Parti du Peuple Algérien&quot; (PPA) in March 1937.

However, in March 1941 Messali Hadj was tried by a Vichy court and sentenced to 16 years of hard labour. He was confined first to southern Algeria and then in Brazzaville in French Equatorial Africa. Nonetheless, he continued to be active in the Algerian nationalist movement. Once World War II came to an end, he was amnestied and returned to Algeria. However, straining relations between the &quot;Parti du Peuple Algérien&quot; and the &quot;Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté&quot; (AML), as well as the decision to arrest and deport Messali Hadj, contributed to the outbreak of riots in Sétif and Constantinois on May 8, 1945. It was the first day of peace after the Nazi surrender in World War II and despite the celebrations in France, the mood of the French remained somber. France was low on resources, fuel, and raw materials, its railway infrastructure and industry in ruins. Politically, unrest was mounting, and even the accusation of collaboration was enough to paint a target on someone&#x27;s back. Meanwhile the Muslims of Algeria were mobilizing to march for their own self-determination under slogans like &quot;Muslims Awaken!&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Muslim flag that will float over North Africa&quot; appearing on graffitied walls overnight. Messali Hadj had been exiled to Brazzaville as soon as French authorities received word of plans by &quot;Parti du Peuple Algérien&quot; to escalate the deepening unrest between the French settler &quot;colons&quot; and the Muslims. The death of some one hundred Europeans during the riots saw the French authorities ruthlessly suppress the Algerian nationalists and the army and police killed approximately 10,000 Muslims.

By 1946 Messali Hadj founded the &quot;Mouvement pour le triomphe des libertés démocratiques&quot; (MTLD) to replace the PPA, which had been outlawed by the French authorities. However, the MTLF was often referred to as the &quot;MTLD-PPA&quot; because, whilst the MTLD pursued public political strategies, the PPA continued to press for independence. By the end of 1947 the PPA-MTLD approved the creation of the Organisation spéciale to accelerate the independence movement. The party achieved considerable success in the elections for the Algerian Assembly. However, Messali Hadj&#x27;s assertion of Arabism alienated the Kabyles and contributed to the Berberist crisis in 1949.

Once the Algerian War of Liberation began, Messali Hadj sought to compete with the Front de Libération Nationale by mobilising the Mouvement National Algérien (MNA) in December 1954.

=== Leader of the MNA ===
After the outbreak of the Algerian War of Independence in 1954 which was started against his wishes, Messali created the Mouvement National Algérien, or MNA (&quot;Algerian National Movement&quot;). Messali&#x27;s followers clashed with the FLN; it was the only socialist faction not absorbed into the Front&#x27;s fight for independence. The FLN&#x27;s armed wing, the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) wiped out the MNA&#x27;s guerrilla apparatus in Algeria early on in the war; the infighting then continued in France, during the so-called &quot;café wars&quot; over control of the expatriate community. According to author Remy Mauduit the FLN’s fight with the Messalists “did not stop until the Messalists were exterminated or forced to rally to the French.” According to this author, 10,000 were killed and another 25,000 wounded in the conflict. In 1958, Messali supported the proposals of President Charles de Gaulle, and France probably attempted to capitalize on the internal rivalries of the nationalist movement. During negotiation talks in 1961 the FLN did not accept the participation of the MNA, and this led to new outbursts of fighting.

=== After Algerian independence ===

In 1962, as Algeria gained independence from France, Messali tried to transform his group into a legitimate political party, but it was not successful, and the FLN seized control over Algeria as a one-party state.

== Personal life ==
He was married to Émilie Busquant, a French feminist, anarcho-syndicalist and anti-colonial activist.

His daughter, Djanina Messali-Benkelfat, published a book about her father called &quot;Une vie partagée avec Messali Hadj, mon père&quot; (&quot;A Life Shared with Messali Hadj, my Father&quot;).

Messali Hadj was in exile in France when he died in 1974. His body was buried in his native Tlemcen.

<doc id="529895" wikidata="Q1532008" url="?curid=529895" title="Carotid body">
<text>The carotid body is a small cluster of peripheral chemoreceptor cells and supporting sustentacular cells situated at the bifurcation of each common carotid artery in its tunica externa.

The carotid body detects changes in the composition of arterial blood flowing through it, mainly the partial pressure of arterial oxygen, but also of carbon dioxide. It is also sensitive to changes in blood pH, and temperature.

==Structure==
The carotid body is situated on the posterior aspect of the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.

The carotid body is made up of two types of cells, called glomus cells: glomus type I cells are peripheral chemoreceptors, and glomus type II cells are sustentacular supportive cells.

* Glomus type I cells are derived from the neural crest. They release a variety of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, ATP, and dopamine that trigger EPSPs in synapsed neurons leading to the respiratory center. They are innervated by axons of the glossopharyngeal nerve which collectively are called the carotid sinus nerve.
* Glomus type II cells resemble glial cells, express the glial marker S100 and act as supporting cells.

==Function==

The carotid body functions as a sensor: it responds to a stimulus, primarily O2 partial pressure, which is detected by the type I (glomus) cells, and triggers an action potential through the afferent fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve, which relays the information to the central nervous system.

===Stimulus===
The carotid body peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen (P). This is in contrast to the central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata that are primarily sensitive to changes in pH and P (a decrease in pH and an increase in P). The carotid body chemoreceptors are also sensitive to pH and P, but only secondarily. More specifically, the sensitivity of carotid body chemoreceptors to decreased P is greater when pH is decreased and P is increased.

Impulse rate for carotid bodies is particularly sensitive to changes in arterial PO2 in the range of 60 down to 30 mm Hg, a range in which hemoglobin saturation with oxygen decreases rapidly.

The output of the carotid bodies is low at an oxygen partial pressure above about 100mmHg (13,3 kPa) (at normal physiological pH), but below 60mmHg the activity of the type I (glomus) cells increases rapidly due to a decrease in hemoglobin-oxygen saturation below 90%.

===Detection===
The mechanism for detecting reductions in P has yet to be identified, there may be multiple mechanisms and could vary between species. Hypoxia detection has been shown to depend upon increased hydrogen sulfide generation produced by cystathionine gamma-lyase as hypoxia detection is reduced in mice in which this enzyme is knocked out or pharmacologically inhibited. The process of detection involves the interaction of cystathionine gamma-lyase with hemeoxygenase-2 and the production of carbon monoxide. Yet, some studies show that physiologic concentration of hydrogen sulfide may not be strong enough to trigger such responses.

Other theories suggest it may involve mitochondrial oxygen sensors and the haem-containing cytochromes that undergo reversible one-electron reduction during oxidative-phosphorylation. Haem reversibly binds O2 with an affinity similar to that of the carotid body, suggesting that haem containing proteins may have a role in O2, potentially this could be one of the complexes involved in oxidative-phosphorylation. This leads to increases in reactive oxygen species and rises in intracellular Ca2+. However, whether hypoxia leads to an increase or decrease in reactive oxygen species is unknown. The role of reactive oxygen species in hypoxia sensing is also under question.

The oxygen dependent enzyme haem-oxidase has also been put forward as a hypoxia sensor. In normoxia, haem-oxygenase generates carbon monoxide (CO), CO activates the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, BK. Falls in CO that occur as a consequence of hypoxia would lead to closure of this potassium channel and this would lead to membrane depolarisation and consequence activation of the carotid body. A role for the &quot;energy sensor&quot; AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has also been proposed in hypoxia sensing. This enzyme is activated during times of net energy usage and metabolic stress, including hypoxia. AMPK has a number of targets and it appears that, in the carotid body, when AMPK is activated by hypoxia, it leads to downstream potassium channel closure of both O2-sentive TASK-like and BK channels

An increased P is detected because the CO2 diffuses into the cell, where it increases the concentration of carbonic acid and thus protons. The precise mechanism of CO2 sensing is unknown, however it has been demonstrated that CO2 and low pH inhibit a TASK-like potassium conductance, reducing potassium current. This leads to depolarisation of the cell membrane which leads to Ca2+ entry, excitation of glomus cells and consequent neurotransmitter release.

Arterial acidosis (either metabolic or from altered P) inhibits acid-base transporters (e.g. Na+-H+) which raise intracellular pH, and activates transporters (e.g. Cl−-HCO3−) which decrease it. Changes in proton concentration caused by acidosis (or the opposite from alkalosis) inside the cell stimulates the same pathways involved in P sensing.

Another mechanism is through oxygen sensitive potassium channels. A drop in dissolved oxygen lead to closing of these channels which results in depolarization. This leads to release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the glossopharyngeal and vagus afferente to the vasomotor area.

===Action potential===
The type I (glomus) cells in the carotid (and aortic bodies) are derived from neuroectoderm and are thus electrically excitable. A decrease in oxygen partial pressure, an increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure, and a decrease in arterial pH can all cause depolarization of the cell membrane, and they affect this by blocking potassium currents. This reduction in the membrane potential opens voltage-gated calcium channels, which causes a rise in intracellular calcium concentration. This causes exocytosis of vesicles containing a variety of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, adenosine, ATP, substance P, and met-enkephalin. These act on receptors on the afferent nerve fibres which lie in apposition to the glomus cell to cause an action potential.

===Relay===
The feedback from the carotid body is sent to the cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla oblongata via the afferent branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve. (The efferent fibers of the aortic body chemoreceptors are relayed by the vagus nerve.) These centers, in turn, regulate breathing and blood pressure, with hypoxia causing an increase in ventilation.

==Clinical significance==
===Paraganglioma===

A paraganglioma is a tumor that may involve the carotid body and is usually benign. Rarely, a malignant neuroblastoma may originate from the carotid body.

<doc id="529896" wikidata="Q3100791" url="?curid=529896" title="Western fence lizard">
<text>The western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) is a species of lizard native to Arizona, New Mexico, and California, as well as Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Northern Mexico. The species is widely found in its native range and is considered common, often being seen in yards, or as the name implies, on fences. As the ventral abdomen of an adult is characteristically blue, it is also known as the blue-belly. Two western fence lizards have been reported with duplicated or forked tails, presumably following an autotomy.

==Taxonomy==
Taxonomy for the western fence lizard has been under much debate. &quot;S. occidentalis&quot; belongs in the order Squamata (snakes and lizards) and the suborder Iguania. The family in which it belongs is still under scrutiny. The family Phrynosomatidae, along with seven other families, used to be included in the single family Iguanidae, until Frost and Etheridge&#x27;s (1989) analysis of iguanian systematics suggested the family be divided. Most literature, however, still place the phrynosomatids in Iguanidae.

Five subspecies are recognized, as follows:
*San Joaquin fence lizard, &quot;Sceloporus occidentalis biseriatus&quot;
*Coast Range fence lizard, &quot;Sceloporus occidentalis bocourtii&quot;
*Great Basin fence lizard, &quot;Sceloporus occidentalis longipes&quot;
*Northwestern fence lizard, &quot;Sceloporus occidentalis occidentalis&quot;
*Sierra fence lizard, &quot;Sceloporus occidentalis taylori&quot;

Some authors have raised the island fence lizard to specific rank, &quot;Sceloporus becki&quot;. However, recent work in molecular systematics has suggested there are four clades and 11 genetically separable populations, and the subspecies will probably have to be redefined.

==Identification==

Western fence lizards measure (snout-vent length) and a total length of about . They are brown to black in color (the brown may be sandy or greenish) and have black stripes on their backs, but their most distinguishing characteristic is their bright blue bellies. The ventral sides of the limbs are yellow. Male blue belly lizards also have blue patches on their throats. This bright coloration is faint or absent in both females and juveniles. In some populations the males also display iridescent, bright turquoise blue spots on the dorsal surface. The scales of &quot;S. occidentalis&quot; are sharply keeled, and between the interparietal and rear of thighs, there are 35–57 scales.

Many other lizards have similar bright-blue coloring. The eastern fence lizard, &quot;S. undulatus&quot;, instead of having one large patch on its throat, has two small patches. The sagebrush lizard, &quot;S. graciosus&quot;, lacks yellow limbs and has smaller dorsal scales. &quot;S. occidentalis&quot; also resembles the side-blotched lizard, &quot;Uta stansburiana&quot;. However, the axilla of &quot;U. stansburiana&quot; usually has a black spot behind it and it has a complete gular fold.

==Distribution and habitat==
Although California is the heart of the range of this lizard, it is also found in eastern and southwestern Oregon (some populations are found even north of Seattle, Washington), as well as in the Columbia River Gorge, southwestern Idaho, Nevada, western Utah, northwestern Baja California, New Mexico, Arizona, and some of the islands off the coast of both California and Baja California. There is also an isolated population in the Northwestern Tualatin Valley, around Henry Hagg Lake.

The western fence lizard occupies a variety of habitats. It is found in grassland, broken chaparral, sagebrush, woodland, coniferous forest, and farmland, and occupies elevations from sea level to 10,800 ft. They generally avoid the harsh desert and are often found near water.

As of now, the western fence lizard is listed as unprotected, and no conservation restrictions apply.
== Urbanization ==
Habitat loss caused by urbanization has many effects on the western fence lizard. Lizards in an urbanized environment have evolved to have shorter limbs and toes. This is because of the change in surfaces that the lizards use. While before urbanization western fence lizards used mostly woody substances, after urbanization they used more man-made substances, a greater breadth of habitats and developed shorter limbs and toes.

The habitat loss also causes a decrease in the number of scales. This is because of the urban heat island effect, increasing the temperature year round. The increase in temperature causes an increase in scale size and a decrease in scale number as it decreases the number of living cells in-between the scales and lowers evaporative water loss and heat load.

==Behavior==
These lizards are diurnal, and are commonly seen basking on paths, rocks, and fence posts, and other suitable sunny locations. They can change color from light grey or tan to nearly jet black for the purpose of thermoregulation while basking. &quot;S. occidentalis&quot; goes through a period of brumation during the winter. The length of time and when they emerge varies depending on climate. During the mating season, adult males will defend a home range.

The western fence lizard primarily eats small invertebrates, but may consume any appropriately sized prey item.

==Reproduction==
Western fence lizards mate in the spring, and do not breed until the spring of their second year. Females lay eggs under a flat surface by digging a nest at night. She lays one to three clutches of three to 17 eggs (usually eight) between April and July. The eggs hatch in August.

==Lyme disease==

Studies have shown that cases of Lyme disease are rarer in areas where the lizards are found. When ticks carrying Lyme disease feed on these lizards&#x27; blood (which they commonly do, especially around their ears), a protein in the lizard&#x27;s blood kills the bacterium in the tick that causes Lyme disease. The infection inside the ticks&#x27; gut is therefore cleared and the tick no longer carries Lyme disease.

<doc id="529916" wikidata="Q18361829" url="?curid=529916" title="Coronary arteries">
<text>The coronary arteries are the arterial blood vessels of coronary circulation, which transport oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. The heart requires a continuous supply of oxygen to function and survive, much like any other tissue or organ of the body.

The coronary arteries wrap around the entire heart. The two main branches are the left coronary artery and right coronary artery. The arteries can additionally be categorized based on the area of the heart for which they provide circulation. These categories are called &quot;epicardial&quot; (above the epicardium, or the outermost tissue of the heart) and &quot;microvascular&quot; (close to the endocardium, or the innermost tissue of the heart).

Reduced function of the coronary arteries can lead to decreased flow of oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Not only does this affect supply to the heart muscle itself, but it also can affect the ability of the heart to pump blood throughout the body. Therefore, any disorder or disease of the coronary arteries can have a serious impact on health, possibly leading to angina, a heart attack, and even death.

== Structure ==
The coronary arteries are mainly composed of the left and right coronary arteries, both of which give off several branches, as shown in the &#x27;coronary artery flow&#x27; figure.

* Aorta
**Left coronary artery
***Left anterior descending artery
***Left circumflex artery
***Posterior descending artery
***Ramus or intermediate artery
**Right coronary artery
***Right marginal artery
***Posterior descending artery

The left coronary artery arises from the aorta within the left cusp of the aortic valve and feeds blood to the left side of the heart. It branches into two arteries, the left anterior descending and the left circumflex. The left anterior descending artery perfuses the interventricular septum and anterior wall of the left ventricle. The left circumflex artery perfuses the left ventricular free wall. In approximately 33% of individuals, the left coronary artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery which perfuses the posterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle. Sometimes a third branch is formed at the fork between left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries, known as a &quot;ramus&quot; or &quot;intermediate artery&quot;.

The right coronary artery (RCA) originates within the right cusp of the aortic valve. It travels down the right coronary sulcus, towards the crux of the heart. The RCA primarily branches into the right marginal arteries, and, in 67% of individuals, gives place to the posterior descending artery. The right marginal arteries perfuse the right ventricle and the posterior descending artery perfuses the left ventricular posterior and inferior walls.

There is also the conus artery, which is only present in about 45 percent of the human population, and which provides collateral blood flow to the heart when the left anterior descending artery is occluded.

==Clinical significance==
Narrowing of the arteries can be caused by a process known as atherosclerosis (most common), arteriosclerosis, or arteriolosclerosis. This occurs when plaques (made up of deposits of cholesterol and other substances) build up over time in the walls of the arteries. Coronary artery disease (CAD) or ischemic heart disease are the terms used to describe narrowing of the coronary arteries.

As the disease progresses, plaque buildup can partially block blood flow to the heart muscle. Without enough blood supply (ischemia), the heart is unable to work properly, especially under increased stress. Stable angina is chest pain on exertion that improves with rest. Unstable angina is chest pain that can occur at rest, feels more severe, and/or last longer than stable angina. It is caused by more severe narrowing of the arteries.
A heart attack results from a sudden plaque rupture and formation of a thrombus (blood clot) that completely blocks blood flow to a portion of the heart, leading to tissue death (infarct).

CAD can also result in heart failure or arrhythmias. Heart failure is caused by chronic oxygen deprivation due to reduced blood flow, which weakens the heart over time. Arrhythmias are caused by inadequate blood supply to the heart that interferes with the heart&#x27;s electric impulse.

The coronary arteries can constrict as a response to various stimuli, mostly chemical. This is known as a coronary reflex.

There is also a rare condition known as spontaneous coronary artery dissection, in which the wall of one of the coronary arteries tears, causing severe pain. Unlike CAD, spontaneous coronary artery dissection is not due to plaque buildup in arteries, and tends to occur in younger individuals, including women who have recently given birth or men who do intense exercise.

Coronary artery dominance is described as the coronary artery that give branches to supply the right posterior descending artery and supplies the inferior wall of the heart. In 80 to 85% of the population, the right coronary artery supplies the posterior descending artery, making it right heart dominant while in 7 to 13% of the population, the left coronary artery supplies the posterior descending artery, making it left heart dominant. In 7 to 8% of the population, both right and left coronary arteries supplies the posterior descending artery, making it right and left co-dominance. Narrowing of coronary arteries is more frequent in those who are left dominant when compared to those who have right dominant or co-dominant hearts.

==Name etymology==

The word &quot;&quot; is a Latin word meaning &quot;crown&quot;, from the Ancient Greek (, &quot;garland, wreath&quot;). It was applied to the coronary arteries because of a notional resemblance (compare the photos).

The word &quot;arterie&quot; in Anglo-French (&#x27; in Old French, and &#x27; in Latin) means &quot;windpipe&quot; and &quot;an artery&quot;. It was applied to the coronary arteries because the arteries do not contain blood after death.

<doc id="529930" wikidata="Q127370" url="?curid=529930" title="Honda Inspire">
<text>The is a mid-size sedan derived from the Honda Accord chassis. The first Inspire debuted in late 1989 as the Accord Inspire, a sister nameplate to the Honda Vigor. It was sold at different retail channels in Japan, known as &quot;Honda Verno&quot; for the Vigor/Saber, and as the Inspire at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; stores.

==Nameplate history==
In 1995, the Inspire was updated and exported to the US as the Acura 3.2 TL, while the Vigor nameplate was replaced with the Honda Saber. The longitudinal 2.5L straight-five engine layout and platform remained and was sold as the Acura 2.5 TL.

In 1999, these cars were replaced by the second generation TL that was based on the US-spec Accord platform, and largely designed and engineered in the US by Honda R&amp;D Americas, Inc. in Raymond, Ohio. Manufactured in the US, these were imported into Japan as the new Inspire and Saber.

In June 2003, the fourth-generation Inspire was introduced in Japan derived from the North American Honda Accord V6. This Inspire marks the first time Honda introduced their Variable Cylinder Management technology. In October 2005, the fourth-generation Inspire received a mild restyle, with new headlights, new tail lights, revised interior and new colors. The Inspire targeted the Nissan Teana, the Toyota Mark X and numerous other entry level luxury cars from Japan.

In October 2007, the fifth-generation Inspire was previewed at the Tokyo Motor Show. It is essentially a rebadged 2008 North American market Accord with minor exterior and interior modifications.

In September 2012, after six generations and 23 years, along with the introduction of the ninth-generation Accord, the Inspire ended production for a six-year period. It was then relaunched in 2018 as a China-only model based on the tenth-generation Accord.
== First generation (CB5, CC2 &amp; CC3; 1989)==


On October 12, 1989, the Honda Accord Inspire was introduced. The platform was shared with the Honda Vigor, a JDM Honda Accord derived five-cylinder luxury sedan available only at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; dealerships. The Inspire was introduced during the bubble developed in Japan which would burst in the early 1990s (known in Japan as the &quot;bubble economy&quot;). The SOHC four valves per cylinder G20A inline-five engine was all new and was also used in the JDM Honda Rafaga, which was a shorter sedan shared with the second generation Honda Ascot. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel.

The body style was a four-door hardtop, but it wasn&#x27;t a true hardtop, using a &quot;B&quot; pillar between the front and rear passenger compartments, and instead it used frameless doors. The Inspire was available in two versions; a shorter and narrower version badged as the Accord Inspire, with a G20A 2.0-liter engine in compliance with Japanese vehicle size requirements for cars classified as &quot;compact&quot;. The CB5 Inspire was offered in three trim levels: the base AZ-i with manual transmission, AG-I with fog lamps and optional sunroof as well as central locking, and the top spec luxury AX-i with leather upholstery, more safety features and full cruise control as well as power seats. A longer and wider version with the G20 (CC3) or with the new G25A 2.5-liter engine (CC2) debuted in early 1992, similar in dimensions to the first generation Legend. The larger CC2 and CC3 Inspire was a mild makeover of the first CB5 Inspire, featuring updated full-width boot lamps (the updated Vigor had conventional single lamp units) with less chrome, larger bumpers with new wrap-around cornering lamp design (instead of the optional separate units like the CB5) and mesh alloy wheels. The new Inspire offered fewer trim levels and the 2-liter inline-five received a minor upgrade, with power creeping up from . The new 2.5 develops . The CC2/CC3 Inspire shared more features with the Acura Vigor under a &#x27;wide-body&#x27; marketing campaign with minor differences. The smaller-bodied Accord Inspire continued to be available alongside the larger CC2/CC3 until the introduction of the second generation Inspire, as it fit a much lower tax category.

The Inspire offered a luxurious approach to the interior as a lower price alternative to the top level Legend, and both vehicles were sold at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships. Interior appearance was provided by the Japanese furniture company, Tendo Mokko, offering unique leather interior and a choice of genuine wood inserts for the dashboard and center console.

The transmission is attached behind the engine, with a driveshaft that sends power to the front of the car to an asymmetrically installed limited-slip differential which then supplies power to the front wheels using half shafts; this allowed the powertrain to remain slightly behind the front wheels. This also gave the car a 60:40 front to rear weight distribution. The turning radius of the Inspire also was not as tight as its competitors due to the use of Constant-velocity joint installed on the front axle half shafts, but the Inspire did have an advantage in adverse traction conditions.
== Second generation (UA1–UA3; 1995)==


The second generation Inspire was almost identical in its dimensions to the first generation 1986 Honda Legend, with that vehicle having been updated and enlarged to better fit the role of flagship for the Honda and Acura brands. The second generation Inspire was available with the Type I 3.2 L V6 offered in the Legend on July 6, 1995, while still offering the straight 5 in both 2.0 L and 2.5 L versions. The profile of this vehicle was reduced somewhat to . The luxury approach was enhanced. A carryover from the previous generation saw marginal increases in length, width, and height dimensions for vehicles installed with the V6 engine, but the smaller dimensions were not in compliance with Japanese government regulations concerning dimensions and maximum engine displacement, thereby giving buyers an incentive in interior accommodations when purchasing the V6 model. Each engine choice obligated the Japanese buyer with increased annual road tax liability, and one trim level package was designated with the engine choice, offering stepped levels of standard and luxury equipment for each selection.

The Inspire, sold at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships, was also known as the () and sold at the &quot;Honda Verno&quot; sales network, and mechanically identical to the UA1-UA3 Inspire. Starting with this generation, all Inspire and Saber vehicles were manufactured at Honda&#x27;s Marysville Auto Plant in Ohio, USA.

November 8, 1996 saw the introduction of dual airbags for front seat passengers and anti-lock brakes as standard.

This version of the Inspire competed with the Toyota Camry Gracia, Mark II, Cresta and Chaser, the Nissan Cefiro and Skyline, the Mazda Millenia, and the Mitsubishi Diamante.
== Third generation (UA4 &amp; UA5; 1998)==


The third generation Honda Inspire/Saber was introduced October 15, 1998, and was the first Honda designed and built in the US and exported to Japan. In North America, this vehicle was sold as the Acura TL, while in Japan it was the second model that accompanied the flagship Honda Legend at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; Japanese dealerships. The Saber version of this car was sold as the top level sedan at &quot;Honda Verno&quot;. Honda&#x27;s internet-based navigation system Internavi was introduced with this generation.

The Inspire no longer offered the straight-five engine, and instead offered the VTEC-equipped 3.2-litre J32A and 2.5-litre J25A V6 engines, and a choice of a 4- or 5-speed automatic transmission. The bodystyle was changed from hardtop to sedan as a result of the USA-spec Accord having been upgraded to meet USA requirements for improved side impact protection. A cabin air filter, also known as a pollen filter is introduced with this generation and is located behind the glove compartment for all vehicles sold internationally.

The Honda Saber was discontinued April 2003 along with the consolidation of the Honda Japan sales networks Primo, Clio and Verno.
== Fourth generation (UC1; 2003)==
The fourth generation Honda Inspire was introduced June 18, 2003. This vehicle was built at the Saitama Prefecture facility in Sayama, Japan. It was built on the same platform as the North American seventh generation Honda Accord. Unlike the North American variant it was based on, the Inspire would only come in the sedan body style, while powertrain was only available with the 3.0 L J30A V6 with i-VTEC, and a 5-speed automatic transmission. It was available in three trims including 30TE, 30TL, and AVANZARE, with the latter being the highest trim. A 30TE limited trim would be available for the 2005 model year.

Styling would be consistent between the Inspire and Accord it was based upon. Notable differences would include standard fog lights on all trims, a redesigned grill, and a new light on the trunk lid. The headlights are different as well featuring High-intensity discharge lamp bulbs for the low beams. A new styling was introduced November 4, 2005, changing both the front grille and rear tail lights, in which LED lighting would be implemented.

This was the first vehicle to showcase Honda&#x27;s Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) technology. Another technology introduced on the Inspire was Honda&#x27;s Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS, originally introduced as CMS). Honda also made available its Intelligent Highway Cruise Control (IHCC), &quot;C-MOS&quot;, which utilized a front-mounted camera to assist in unwanted lane drifting. An Internet-based navigation service called Internavi is available for drivers in Japan.

== Fifth generation (CP3; 2007)==

The fifth generation Honda Inspire was released on December 21, 2007 in Japan. Like the fourth generation Inspire, the fifth generation would be based on the North American eighth generation Honda Accord. Unlike the North American car it was based upon, and like its predecessor, the fifth generation Inspire would only be available as a sedan with a V6. It would use a similar 5-speed automatic transmission, but power would be increased by switching to the 3.5 L J35Z2 i-VTEC VCM V6 (marked as J35A-80).

Unlike its North American relative, the Inspire continued to have technologies such as Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS), Intelligent Highway Cruise Control (IHCC), and Honda&#x27;s Internavi telematics subscription service. A notable change would be the change to Electric power-steering (EPS). This was in effort to reduce power demands on the engine, thereby improving fuel economy.

There are few exterior and interior differences between this Inspire and the Southeast Asian Honda Accord. Sales of this generation of the Inspire ended September 2012 in Japan.

== Sixth generation (CV4 &amp; CV6; 2018)==

The sixth generation Inspire was released in 2018 as a sedan designed exclusively for the Chinese market. It is based on the North American tenth generation Honda Accord with a redesigned front and rear DRG. The sixth generation Inspire is made by Dongfeng Honda to replace the Spirior.

It is available with either the 1.5-liter L15B7 inline-four or the 2-liter LFB11/12 inline-four.

== Seventh generation (CY; 2023)==
The seventh-generation Inspire, based on the eleventh-generation Accord, went on sale in late May 2023.

<text>Sir Edward Maitland Wright (13 February 1906 – 2 February 2005) was an English mathematician, best known for co-authoring &quot;An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers&quot; with G. H. Hardy. He served as the Principal of the University of Aberdeen from 1962 to 1976.
==Career==

He was born in Farnley, near Leeds, Yorkshire, where his father was a soap manufacturer. He moved to the south of England with his mother when his parents separated.

After obtaining a first-class mathematics degree as a self-taught external student at the University of London, Wright studied at Jesus College, Oxford and Christ Church, Oxford. His research career lasted from 1931 until the early 1980s, firstly on a Research Fellowship at Christ Church, which included a year in Göttingen, Germany. He was then appointed a lecturer at Christ Church, teaching there until 1935 followed by his appointment as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Aberdeen. He held that chair from 1936 to 1962, except for a break during the war (from 1943 to 1945) when he was seconded to the Air Ministry Intelligence at MI6 headquarters. He became Vice-Principal of the University in 1961 and Principal and Vice-Chancellor from 1962 until he stood down in 1976. He nevertheless continued to work as a Research Fellow at the University until 1983. A building there is named after him in recognition of his service to the university.

Wright worked in many different subspecialties, including number theory and graph theory, and published over a hundred papers. Most of his work focused on analytic number theory.

==Honours and awards==
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937 and awarded their Makdougall Brisbane Prize in 1952.

He was elected to the London Mathematical Society in 1929 and awarded their Senior Berwick Prize in 1978.

He was knighted in 1977 and awarded the Gold Medal of the Order of Polonia Restituta of Poland in 1978.

==Private life==
He died in Reading shortly before his 99th birthday. He had married Phyllis Harris of North Wales, with whom he had a son, the mathematician John D. M. Wright.

<text>Robert Lee &quot;Hoot&quot; Gibson (born October 30, 1946), (Capt, USN, Ret.), is a former American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, and aeronautical engineer. A retired NASA astronaut, he also served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from 1992 to 1994. Today Gibson is active as a professional pilot, racing regularly at the annual Reno Air Races. He was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2003 and the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2013, and has received several military decorations throughout his career.

==Early life and education==
Gibson was born October 30, 1946, in Cooperstown, New York. He graduated from Huntington High School, Huntington, New York as a part of the Class of 1964, and went on to earn an Associate degree in engineering science from Suffolk County Community College in 1966. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from California Polytechnic State University in 1969.

==Military career==
Gibson entered active duty with the U.S. Navy in 1969. He was commissioned through the Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS), and proceed to flight training. He received basic and primary flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola and Naval Air Station Saufley Field, Florida, and Naval Air Station Meridian, Mississippi. He completed advanced flight training at Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas and was assigned to Fighter Squadron 121 (VF-121) at Naval Air Station Miramar, California for replacement training in the F-4 Phantom II.

While assigned to Fighter Squadron 111 (VF-111) and Fighter Squadron 1 (VF-1) from April 1972 to September 1975, he saw duty aboard aircraft carriers and , flying combat missions in Southeast Asia in the F-4 with VF-111 and making the initial operational carrier deployment of the F-14 Tomcat with VF-1. He is a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as &quot;TOPGUN.&quot;

Gibson returned to the United States and an assignment as an F-14A instructor pilot with Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124) at Naval Air Station Miramar. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland in June 1977 and later became involved in the test and evaluation of improvements to the F-14A aircraft while assigned to the Naval Air Test Center&#x27;s Strike Aircraft Test Directorate.

Selected as a NASA astronaut, he continued to be promoted, eventually achieving the rank of captain in the U.S. Navy and the rank at which he retired from active naval service.

Charles F. Bolden, his copilot on STS-61-C, described Gibson and John Young as the two best pilots he had met &quot;in my life in aviation, over thirty-five years; never met two people like them. Everyone else gets into an airplane; John and Hoot wear their airplane. They&#x27;re just awesome&quot;.

Gibson&#x27;s flight experience included over 6,000 flying hours (14,000 hours in total) in over 140 types of civil and military aircraft. He holds an airline transport pilot license. In 2006 he was required to stop flying for the airlines because he reached his 60th birthday. He still holds a multi-engine and instrument rating. He has held a private pilot rating since age 17. Gibson has also completed over 300 carrier landings.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in January 1978, Gibson became an astronaut in August 1979. Gibson flew five missions: STS-41-B in 1984, STS-61-C in 1986, STS-27 in 1988, STS-47 in 1992, and STS-71 in 1995. Gibson served as Chief of the Astronaut Office (December 1992 to September 1994) and as Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations (March–November 1996).

On his first space flight, Gibson was the pilot on the crew of STS 41-B which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 3, 1984. The flight accomplished the deployment of two Hughes 376 communications satellites which later failed to reach desired geosynchronous orbits due to upper-stage rocket failures. The STS 41-B mission marked the first checkout of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and Manipulator Foot Restraint (MFR), with Bruce McCandless II and Bob Stewart performing two EVAs (spacewalks). The German Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS), Remote Manipulator System (RMS), six &quot;Getaway Specials&quot;, and materials processing experiments were included on the mission. The eight-day orbital flight of &quot;Challenger&quot; culminated in the first-ever landing at the Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 1984.

Gibson was the commander of the STS-61-C mission, and the first of only four people under the age of 40 to command an STS Orbiter. The seven-man crew on board the Orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center on January 12, 1986. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed the SATCOM Ku satellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. The mission concluded with a successful night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 18, 1986.

Gibson subsequently participated in the investigation of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, and also participated in the redesign and recertification of the solid rocket boosters.

As the commander of STS-27, Gibson and his five-man crew launched from the Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1988, aboard the Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The mission carried a Department of Defense payload, and a number of secondary payloads. After 68 orbits of the Earth the mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base on December 6, 1988. The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damage &quot;Atlantis&quot; sustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent.

When in training for the 1991 STS-46 mission, Gibson was involved in a collision during a weekend air race in Texas that left a second pilot dead and raised questions about the enforcement of rules banning such high-risk activity by expensively trained astronauts. He lost his flight status on NASA&#x27;s T-38 training aircraft for one year, thus being unable to participate in the training for the mission.

On Gibson&#x27;s fourth space flight, the fiftieth Space Shuttle mission, he served as commander of STS-47, Spacelab-J, which launched on September 12, 1992, aboard the Orbiter &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The mission was a cooperative venture between the United States and Japan, and included the first Japanese astronaut, Mamoru Mohri, and the first African-American woman, Mae Jemison, in the crew. During the eight-day flight, the crew focused on life science and materials processing experiments in over forty investigations in the Spacelab laboratory, as well as scientific and engineering tests performed aboard the Orbiter &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The mission ended with a successful landing on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on September 20, 1992.

On his last flight, (June 27 to July 7, 1995), Gibson commanded a crew of seven-members (up) and eight-members (down) on Space Shuttle mission STS-71. This was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. The &quot;Atlantis&quot; Space Shuttle was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. It also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed various life sciences experiments and data collections. When the hatch separating the two modules was opened, Gibson and Vladimir Dezhurov shook hands, symbolizing the newly-found cooperation between the United States of America and the Russian Federation. Later that day, President Bill Clinton in a statement mentioned that this handshake was a major breakthrough towards the ending of the Cold War.

When giving public speeches, Gibson often jokes that he ended the Cold War.

In five space flights, Gibson completed a total of 36.5 days in space.

==Post-NASA career ==
Gibson left NASA in November 1996 and became a pilot for Southwest Airlines. In 2006, as reported by NASA Watch, Gibson was forced to retire as mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration for commercial airline pilots. Gibson has publicly spoken out against federal regulations which require airline pilots to retire at age 60. In December 2006, he joined the Benson Space Company as chief operating officer and chief test pilot. Gibson has flown 111 different aircraft types, and has become a regular competitor at the annual Reno Air Races. In 1998, Gibson flying the Hawker Sea Fury &quot;Riff-Raff&quot; won the Unlimited Class in the Inaugural Running of the EAA AirVenture Cup Race.
Beginning in 2009, Gibson flew as a demonstration pilot for Hawker Beechcraft Corporation to showcase the Premier 1A light business jet across the United States and overseas.

In 2010, The Academy of Model Aeronautics, the United States&#x27; national aeromodeling organization, named Gibson a spokesperson and Ambassador to promote the hobby of radio controlled model flight and to encourage an interest in aviation amongst young people. Gibson has stated that his interest in manned flight and his career as a test pilot and astronaut has its origin in his building of model aircraft as a youth. Gibson remains an avid radio controlled model hobbyist and is reportedly constructing a flyable version of the experimental vertical take off and landing Convair XFY-1 &quot;Pogo&quot; of the 1950s.

Gibson worked with the National Transportation Safety Board following the 2011 Reno Air Races crash. This was documented in an &quot;Air Disasters&quot; episode several years later.

In September 2013, Gibson qualified the Hawker Sea Fury known as &quot;September Fury&quot; in race #232 at the 50th National Championship Air Races at a speed of 479.164 mph. This is the fastest Sea Fury qualifying time.

In September 2015, Gibson qualified the P-51D, known as &quot;Strega&quot; at the 52nd National Championship Air Races at a speed of 475.043, and won the Gold Unlimited Race finishing at 488.983 mph average speed. He was crowned the Unlimited Gold Champion for 2015.

==Personal life==
On May 30, 1981, he married fellow astronaut, Rhea Seddon of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Their first child was born in July 1982. Gibson already had one child, a daughter, from his first marriage. Gibson and Seddon had two further children. 

Gibson enjoys home-built aircraft, Formula One Air Racing, Unlimited Class Air Racing, running and surfing during his free time.

In October 2007, Gibson was a contestant on &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot;. During his appearance, he became the first contestant to make it to the million-dollar question without using any of his cheats. He incorrectly answered the $1,000,000 question (&quot;How many factors do 32 and 28 share?&quot;). The correct answer is three; 1, 2, and 4. He answered with two (2 and 4). All of his prize money ($25,000) went to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.

<text>Augustus Frederick Goodridge (c. 1839 – February 16, 1920) was a Newfoundland merchant and politician. He was premier of Newfoundland in 1894.

==Early life==
Goodridge was born in Devon, England. He arrived in Newfoundland when he was 13 and worked in his father&#x27;s business.

==Career==
Goodridge became a fish merchant and ship owner in St. John&#x27;s. He joined the Conservative Party, and was first elected to the House of Assembly in 1880. He became leader of the Conservatives in 1884. From 1885 to 1889 he served in the conservative Protestant &quot;Reform Party&quot; government of Sir Robert Thorburn. The Reform Party collapsed and Thorburn went into opposition as leader of the new &quot;Tory Party&quot;.

Goodridge&#x27;s Tories lost the 1893 election to the Liberals led by Sir William Whiteway. However, the Tories complained that Whiteway&#x27;s Liberals had promised jobs to Newfoundlanders who voted for him and filed petitions in the Supreme Court under the Corrupt Practices Act against fifteen Liberal members of the House alleging bribery and corruption. The members were tried and found guilty and their seats were declared vacant.

In April 1894, in the midsts of the trials, Whiteway attempted to dissolve the House of Assembly and call new elections. Instead, Governor Sir Arthur Murray refused Whiteway&#x27;s requested and instead appointed Goodridge as the new Premier despite the fact that Goodridge&#x27;s Tories were outnumbered by Liberals in the House of Assembly. In order to prevent the Tories from being defeated by a Motion of No Confidence, Murray repeatedly prorogued the House before a vote could be held. Regardless of this assistance by the governor, Goodridge&#x27;s Tory Party government was short lived due to a mounting political and economic crisis and resigned on December 12, 1894, after the collapse of two banks.

Goodridge lost his seat in the 1904 election. A few years later he was appointed to the Legislative Council (Newfoundland&#x27;s upper house) by Prime Minister Edward Patrick Morris.

<doc id="529946" wikidata="Q5336827" url="?curid=529946" title="Eden Center">
<text>Eden Center is a Vietnamese American strip mall located near the crossroads of Seven Corners in the City of Falls Church, Virginia. Eden Center is the largest Vietnamese commercial center on the East Coast and is considered Falls Church&#x27;s top tourist destination. The center is home to more than 120 shops, restaurants and businesses catering extensively to the Asian American, especially the Vietnamese-American, population. Eden Center has created an anchor for Vietnamese culture serving the Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania areas, as shown by the large number of phở soup restaurants, bánh mì delicatessens, bakeries, markets, as well as Vietnamese-American cultural events that are regularly held at the center.

==History==
The center opened in 1962 as the Plaza Seven Shopping Center, with a Grand Union supermarket and a Zayre discount store serving as anchors. After the Grand Union store closed in 1984, Vietnamese merchants displaced from the &quot;Little Saigon&quot; area in the Clarendon neighborhood of nearby Arlington, Virginia, due to Washington Metro subway construction and redevelopment moved into the space, as the Vietnamese-American community in Northern Virginia (and the Washington, DC, metropolitan area) grew following the Vietnam War. The mall is named after the Eden Arcade market in Ho Chi Minh City. The cluster of stores took on the Eden name, and erected an &quot;Eden&quot; sign. It ultimately evolved into the name for the entire center. The landlord, Capital Commercial Properties, later added a clock tower and an arch flanked by lions, inspired by the Bến Thành Market in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

==Layout==
Most businesses are located on ground level and offer direct access to the sidewalk and parking lot, as would a conventional strip mall. About 65 more stores and restaurants are inside three enclosed malls. In the rear of the mall are additional businesses, currently including a nightclub.

The main parking lot has about 900 spaces, with about 300 more behind the stores.

The mall flies a South Vietnamese Flag, as do many Vietnamese-owned businesses in the Washington, D.C., area.

==Stores==
Eden Center is host to a variety of business types, a few of which incorporate &quot;Eden&quot; in their names. Most are food-related: restaurants, supermarkets, and specialty delicatessens catering prepared foods. Restaurants range from carry-out-only places that serve stir-fry dishes and spring rolls to high-volume phở soup restaurants to sit-down restaurants with large varied menus and a formal decor. Other businesses include jewelry stores, herbal medicine shops, clothing and toy stores, and travel agents.

A 44,000-square foot Good Fortune supermarket opened in the former Ames building in November 2014.

Eden Center was featured on the January 19, 2009, episode of &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot; that focused on the Washington, D.C., area, with Bourdain visited the Song Que deli.

==Events==

Eden Center hosts an annual Tết, or Vietnamese New Year festival, and an annual Moon Festival, both widely attended with a vibrant display of special food, performers, fireworks, and lion dancing.

Each September, the Eden Center plays host to the annual &quot;Miss Vietnam DC&quot; scholarship pageant, the preeminent contest of its kind in the Washington, D.C., area.

==Crime==
In 1997, after a fatal shooting, the Falls Church Police Department opened a substation at Eden Center. The property landlord also began operating 48 closed-circuit monitoring cameras.

On August 11, 2011, federal agents, Virginia State Police, and local police jointly raided several businesses in Eden Center, seizing more than $1 million in cash from one business and small amounts from other businesses. Also seized were several gambling machines; and 19 people were arrested on suspicion of gambling and alcohol crimes. Police blamed the Dragon Family gang, a Vietnamese-American criminal gang that operates in Asian-American hubs across North America. No felony charges were ever filed, and ultimately, though some defendants pleaded guilty, many had their cases dismissed before trial. At least one defendant went to trial and was found not guilty of the charges. The raid ignited tensions between the Eden Center businesses and the City of Falls Church government. After a second raid five months later arrested suspects on a variety of gambling and money laundering charges, many in the community alleged racism and poor investigation by the police.

<text>Cosby is an American television sitcom that aired on CBS from September 16, 1996, to April 28, 2000. The program starred Bill Cosby (in his final series) and Phylicia Rashad, who had previously worked together in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1984–1992). Madeline Kahn portrayed their neighborly friend, Pauline, until her death in 1999. The show was adapted from the British sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;.

==Premise==
Set at the corner of 33rd Ave and 1539 Blake St. in Astoria, Queens, Cosby portrayed grumpy Hilton Lucas, a New York City man forced into early retirement from his job as an airline customer service agent. His wife Ruth was again played by Phylicia Rashad. Initially, Telma Hopkins was cast as Ruth Lucas; however, she was recast after she reacted poorly to Cosby&#x27;s tendency to ad lib. The couple had one daughter, Erica Lucas, initially portrayed by Audra McDonald and later portrayed by T&#x27;Keyah Crystal Keymáh. Doug E. Doug played Griffin Vesey, a foster son the Lucas family took in when he was younger. Griffin occasionally tried to win Erica&#x27;s affections, but they decided just to remain friends when in the fourth and final season, Darien Sills-Evans portrayed Darien Evans, Erica&#x27;s fiancé/husband. Jurnee Smollett also joined the cast as 11-year-old Jurnee, whom Hilton adored.

The show was based on the concept from the BBC series &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, starring Richard Wilson and Annette Crosbie. David Renwick, the creator and writer of &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, was listed as a consultant of &quot;Cosby&quot;. &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; was notable for containing dark humor for a mainstream sitcom. The tone was significantly lightened for &quot;Cosby&quot;, although certain controversial scenes, such as a scene in which the lead character incinerates a live tortoise, albeit by accident, were recreated.

When the show was under development for CBS, it&#x27;s working title was &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot; (not to be confused with the short-lived 2023-2024 ABC sitcom of the same name respectively), featuring Glenn Plummer as Griffin Vessey and Audra McDonald as Erica Lucas. Madeline Kahn and Phylicia Rashad were the only cast members to survive the pilot episode. The unaired theme by Benny Golson was recorded as a jazz standard while congas and harmonica were later added for the uptempo salsa mix. Telma Hopkins auditioned for the role of Ruth Lucas and won. However, she was replaced shortly before filming the pilot.

A notable later episode was the fourth-season premiere, &quot;My Spy&quot;, which showed Hilton watching an episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; (the 1960s series in which Cosby co-starred) and then dreaming an adventure with Robert Culp&#x27;s character from that series; the episode ends with a brief dream sequence in which Rashad dreams she is playing her previous character from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. The same season also presented an episode entitled &quot;Loving Madeline&quot; which featured the standard opening credits for the series but was in fact a tribute to Kahn featuring the cast members out of character discussing the recently deceased actress, punctuated by clips from past episodes.

&quot;Cosby&quot; premiered to an audience of more than 24.7 million viewers, but averaged 16 million viewers during the course of the season. As the series progressed, ratings shrank and CBS, fresh with new hit comedies in &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; and &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, decided to move the series from Monday to Wednesday, then to the Friday night death slot. The moves led to a drop in ratings. At the end of the fourth season, having accumulated 96 episodes, Cosby and CBS executive Les Moonves mutually decided to end the series. The last episode, &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, aired on April 28, 2000, and was the 96th episode to be produced and broadcast, drawing just over 7 million viewers.

<doc id="529949" wikidata="Q4871802" url="?curid=529949" title="Battle of Mount Longdon">
<text>The Battle of Mount Longdon was fought between the British 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment and elements of the Argentine 7th Infantry Regiment on 11–12 June 1982, towards the end of the Falklands War. It was one of three engagements in a Brigade-size operation that night, along with the Battle of Mount Harriet and the Battle of Two Sisters.

A mixture of hand-to-hand fighting and ranged combat resulted in the British occupying this position above Port Stanley, allowing its capture and the surrender of Argentine forces on the islands.

==Background==

===British forces===
The British force consisted of the Third Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 PARA), under Lieutenant Colonel Hew Pike. Artillery support came from six 105mm light guns of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and the 4.5-in gun of , Second Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 PARA) were in reserve.

British paratroopers carried the semi-automatic L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (SLR) and the L7A2 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). Longer-range precision fire was provided by the bolt-action L42A1 sniper rifle, which was especially valuable during pre-battle reconnaissance engagements.

For clearing bunkers, the M72 LAW, 84mm Carl Gustaf &amp; L2 fragmentation grenades, were widely used and the battalions MILAN anti-tank guided missiles, played a critical role in neutralizing Argentine defensive positions.

===Argentine forces===
The Argentine forces included B Company of the 7th Infantry Regiment (RI 7), part of the 10th Mechanized Infantry Brigade, along with detachments from other units. Paratroop-trained Major Carlos Carrizo Salvadores, served as RI 7’s second-in-command. The regiment, reinforced by two Marine Infantry platoons, defended positions at Mount Longdon, Wireless Ridge, Port Stanley, and Cortley Ridge. At San Miguel del Monte, they had prepared for a potential conflict with Chile, training with the 601st Combat Aviation Battalion where about 50, were trained in commando tactics by Commando-trained Major Oscar Ramón Jaimet.

The defenders, mostly reservists with a year of training, were equipped with FN FAL rifles, including the heavier-barrelled, FAP light machine gun, PAM submachine guns and FN MAG general-purpose machine guns. &quot;Teniente de Navío&quot; ( Marine Captain) Sergio Andrés Dachary oversaw the heavy machine guns teams and protecting rifle squads from the Puerto Belgrano-based &quot;Batallón Infantería Comando&quot; (BICO, Marine Headquarters Battalion) and Military Police.

==Battle==

===British advance===
3 PARA and the supporting Royal Engineers from the 9 Parachute Squadron RE crossed the hills North of Mount Simon to seize the high ground above the settlement known as Estancia House. The weather conditions were atrocious, with the Paras traversing steep slippery hillocks to the objective. Private Nick Rose, 6 Platoon, B Company under Lieutenant Jonathan Shaw:
The terrain dictated exactly how we advanced. A lot of the time if we were going along on tracks – what few we did go on – we used Indian file, which is staggered file on either side of the track, like a zig-zag. But there are great rivers of rock – big white boulders – and you have to cross them and then there&#x27;s the heather and the gorse and its constantly wet. So the wind chill factor was – I think somebody said minus 40 degrees – and storm force winds and horizontal rain – a nightmare scenario. ... We are horrible, we&#x27;re miserable as sin, all of us – we&#x27;re missing home, want a dry fag&quot; [cigarette], &quot;warm, dry boots, a cheese and onion sandwich and a bottle of blue top milk. I used to dream of these.
Captain Matthew Selfridge from 3 PARA&#x27;s B Company and Captain Robbie Burns from the 9th Parachute Squadron (Royal Engineers) set up a patrol base near Murrell Bridge, two kilometres west of Mount Longdon on 3 June, protected by 4 Platoon (under Lieutenant Ian Bickerdike) also from B Company.
From their forward operating base, Selfridge and Burns sent out patrols to scout and disrupt the Argentine positions on Mount Longdon. During one of these missions, Lance-Corporal John Hare of 2 Troop, Royal Engineers, was seriously wounded.

Terry Peck, a former member of the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), participated in these reconnaissance and patrol operations. In early June, while pretending to have lost his way while riding his motorbike, he engaged in conversation with a group of five conscripts under the command of Corporal Remigio Gerónimo Díaz of the 1st Platoon. These soldiers had been assigned to guard supplies that had been airlifted forward and were resting in the sun after consuming several cans of beer at the eastern end of Mount Longdon.

Shortly after this, Peck, while leading a close-target reconnaissance patrol under Corporal Peter Hadden, mistakenly opened fire on Sergeant John Pettinger&#x27;s standing patrol, which also belonged to 3 PARA&#x27;s D Company. No British casualties were recorded in this particular case of friendly fire.

During the night of June 4–5, a three-man British patrol from D Company, comprising Corporal Jerry Phillips with Privates Richard Absolon and Bill Hayward, was deployed to the northern slopes of Mount Longdon. Their objective was to infiltrate the position then held by Sub-Lieutenant Juan Baldini&#x27;s 1st Platoon on the western slopes and capture a prisoner. The patrol was supported by a battery of six 105mm field guns, to provided covering fire. The British snipers targeted Baldini&#x27;s platoon and fired a 66mm anti-tank rocket at a mortar position under the command of Corporal Óscar Carrizo. In response, the Argentine forces returned fire, subjecting the British patrol to machine gun and mortar fire. Despite this exchange, no casualties were reported on either side.

The Argentine 7th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s Reconnaissance Platoon, led by Second Lieutenant Francisco Ramón Galíndez Matienzo, was stationed on Wireless Ridge but could not carry out their own patrols, as they had been designated as the reserve force for the area. Instead, Argentine Commando units, typically assigned to deep reconnaissance missions, assumed this responsibility.

In the early hours of June 7, a combined patrol from the 601 Commando Company and the 601 National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron advanced toward the Murrell Bridge following intelligence reports from Major Jaimet indicating enemy activity in the area. At the same time, two British patrols, led by Corporals Peter Hadden and Mark Brown, had just arrived at a bluff on the western bank of the Murrell River, where Sergeant Ian Addle&#x27;s patrol had established a base.

Shortly after, a sentry detected movement near the bridge, prompting the British forces to open fire. A chaotic firefight ensued in the darkness, with both sides exchanging small arms fire, British LAW rockets and Argentine Energa rifle grenades. The engagement escalated when Captain Rubén Teófilo Figueroa&#x27;s 2nd Assault Section of the 601 Commando Company initiated a counterattack. Under mounting pressure and unable to sustain their position, the British forces were forced to retreat before dawn, leaving behind a substantial quantity of their equipment. The official history of the Parachute Regiment later acknowledged the outcome of the engagement.
They were forced to evacuate their position rapidly, leaving behind their packs and radio, but succeeded in withdrawing without suffering any casualties. The location was checked on the evening of 8 June by another patrol, but there was no sign of the packs or radio, which meant the battalion&#x27;s radio net could have been compromised.
From then on, British patrols were mounted closer to their own lines.

That same night, an eight-man section led by Corporal Oscar Nicolás Albornoz-Guevara from the 4th Regiment&#x27;s C Company, stationed on Two Sisters, attempted to scout and map the British positions near Estancia House. However, they were spotted by British sentrys and 3 PARA&#x27;s Mortar Platoon successfully repelled the Argentine patrol.

Nevertheless, despite evidence of Argentine patrolling, Colonel Pike and his company commanders on the eve of battle still held the Argentine regulars in low regard and did not expect them to put up much resistance. For this reason, the British hoped to surprise the Argentine commanders by advancing as close to their forward platoon as possible under cover of darkness, before rushing the Argentine trenches. The three major objectives – &#x27;Fly Half&#x27;, &#x27;Full Back&#x27; and &#x27;Wing Forward&#x27; – were named after positions in Rugby football. B Company would attack through &#x27;Fly Half&#x27; and proceed to &#x27;Full Back&#x27;, while A Company, followed by C Company if necessary, would do the same on Wireless Ridge.

Private Fabián Passaro of B Company served on Mount Longdon with Baldini&#x27;s 1st Platoon and remembers life at the time:
Most of us had adjusted to what we&#x27;d been landed in, we&#x27;d adjusted to the war. But some boys&quot; [identified in the book &quot;Two Sides of Hell/Los Dos Lados Del Infierno&quot;] &quot;were still very depressed and, in many cases, were getting worse all the time. Of course, we were very fed up with wearing the same clothes for so many days, going without a shower, being so cold, eating badly. It was too many things together, quite apart from our natural fear of the war, the shelling and all that. But I think some of us were adapting better than others. There were kids who were very worried, and I tried to buoy them up a bit. &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry,&#x27; I told them. &#x27;Nothing will happen, we&#x27;re safe here. &#x27;Don&#x27;t you see they could never get right up here? There&#x27;s one thousand of us; if they try to climb, we&#x27;ll see them, we&#x27;ll shoot the shit out of them.&quot;
When 3 PARA&#x27;s B Company (under Major Mike Argue) fixed bayonets to storm the Argentine 1st Platoon positions on Mount Longdon, they found themselves trapped in a minefield. British sappers subsequently counted some 1,500 anti-personnel mines that Lieutenant Diego Arreseigor&#x27;s platoon of Sappers from the 10th Mechanized Engineer Company had laid along the western and northern slopes of Mount Longdon. Corporal Peter Cuxson recalled,
&quot;but only two exploded&quot; &quot;because the rest were frozen.&quot; &quot;Otherwise, the final battle for Port Stanley would have been an altogether different story.&quot;
===Assault on Mount Longdon===
As dusk fell, 3 PARA advanced to their start lines and commenced a four-hour march toward their objectives. While B Company approached Mount Longdon, Corporal Brian Milne triggered a mine, alerting Sub-Lieutenant Baldini&#x27;s platoon. The Argentine troops emerged from their tents and opened fire just as Lieutenant Bickerdike&#x27;s No. 4 Platoon arrived at their positions. During the engagement, Corporal Stewart McLaughlin was spotted eliminating an Argentine 7.62mm machine gun positioned on high ground overlooking the western slopes.

Lieutenant Jonathan Shaw&#x27;s No. 6 Platoon, positioned on B Company&#x27;s right flank, secured the summit of &#x27;Fly Half&#x27; without resistance. However, they had overlooked several Argentine soldiers from the 3rd Platoon, who later fired on the platoon&#x27;s rear, causing several casualties before the area was finally secured. Meanwhile, intense hand-to-hand combat combat erupted in the 1st Platoon sector, lasting three hours until the Paras successfully forced the defenders out.

Across the 1st Platoon&#x27;s position, small groups of soldiers were locked in desperate combat. B Company methodically eliminated the Argentine defensive positions. Privates Ben Gough and Dominic Gray managed to crawl to an Argentine bunker and position themselves beside it as the Argentine Marines inside fired at the British. The two Paras each &quot;posted&quot; a grenade through the firing slit before storming the bunker. Both soldiers were mentioned in despatches for their actions during the battle.

Marine Corporal Carlos Rafael Colemil was part of the forward defence and fought as a sniper:
A British soldier climbed over the rock which supported the accommodation bunker of the 105mm gun crew, and from there he was silhouetted. He screamed like he was giving out orders. I aimed and fired and he fell, then Conscript Daniel Ferrandis alerted me to the approach of three British soldiers on the flank. I observed with a night sight; they were very close. I saw one of them was carrying a gun with a bipod; he fell at the first shot and shouted. Another man approached him and I fired again and also got him ... Many people fell to the ground screaming, but soon the enemy was aware of my presence and every time I fired a shot I received a great deal of fire in response. Not long after my main action, I was wounded ... We could also hear the cries for help from the Rasit radar operator Sergeant Roque Nista, who was wounded. I could hear Sergeant Omar Cabral, who was a sniper: he was also firing.

According to the account of Private Victor José Bruno, Sub-Lieutenant Baldini was killed as he tried to clear a stopage from a machine gun. &quot;The Lieutenant pushed us back and stood up trying to unlock the barrel but then he was shot in his belly by enemy fire&quot;, he recalled in an interview with Eduardo César Gerding of the Nottingham Malvinas Group. Corporal Dario Ríos was found lying dead with his platoon commander and Baldini&#x27;s weapon and boots were removed for the use of British soldiers. Also killed in the initial fighting was Cavalry Sergeant Jorge Alberto Ron (according to Private Altieri who was wounded in the blast that killed the NCO) and the Argentine forward artillery observation officer, Lieutenant Alberto Rolando Ramos, whose last message was that his position was surrounded. Sub-Lieutenant Baldini was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal.

==== Argentine reinforcements ====
When 2nd Lieutenant Enrique Neirotti&#x27;s 3rd Platoon in the southern half and Staff Sergeant Raúl González&#x27;s 2nd Platoon in the northern half of the mountain were on the verge of being overrun, reinforcements arrived from 2nd Lieutenant Hugo Quiroga&#x27;s 1st Platoon of the 10th Engineer Company stationed at &#x27;Full Back.&#x27; Despite intense fighting in this sector, many Argentine positions on the mountain&#x27;s saddle held firm. The recently arrived engineers&#x27; rifle-mounted night sights were particularly effective, causing heavy losses among the advancing Paras.

Private Nick Rose in 6 Platoon recalls:
Pete Gray stood up and went to throw a grenade and he was shot by a sniper in his left forearm. We thought the grenade had gone off. We punched his arm down onto the ground to staunch the bleeding, believing he&#x27;d lost half his right forearm and hand, but it was still there and his arm bent at the forearm instead of the elbow – a horrible thing to watch. ...There&#x27;s &#x27;incoming&#x27; everywhere, loads of stuff going down the range and then &#x27;bang&#x27; my pal &quot;Fester&quot;&quot; [Tony Greenwood], &quot;gets it just above his left eye, only a yard away from me. That was a terrible thing. &#x27;Fester&#x27; was such a lovely guy. Then it was &#x27;Baz&#x27; Barratt. &#x27;Baz&#x27; had gone back to try to get field dressings for Pete Gray and [as] he was coming back, &#x27;bang&#x27;, he got it in the back. This was when we just stalled as a platoon. (Jon Cooksey, op. cit., p. 66)
Argentine resistance was strong and well organized. At the centre of the mountain were Marine conscripts Jorge Maciel and Claudio Scaglione in a bunker with a machine gun, and Marine conscripts Luis Fernández and Sergio Giuseppetti with night-scope equipped rifles.

====Action of Sergeant Ian McKay====
After 3 Para had secured their initial objective, 4 Platoon was ordered to clear the enemy from the northern flank of a long east–west ridge, which was defended by well-concealed machine gun positions. As the platoon advanced, they came under heavy fire, suffering casualties. Realising that no further progress could be made from their exposed position, the Platoon Commander, Lieutenant Ian Bickerdike, ordered a withdrawal to the ridge’s rocky outcrops, where elements of 5 Platoon were regrouping.

While moving forward to reconnoitre the position, Lieutenant Bickerdike and his signaller were both wounded, and command passed to Sergeant McKay. Recognising the critical nature of the situation, he led an assault on the enemy position with Corporal Bailey, 17-year-old Jason Burt, and another private. The attack was met with intense fire, wounding Corporal Bailey and the private. Demonstrating exceptional bravery, Sergeant McKay continued the assault, throwing grenades at the enemy position until he was killed, his body falling onto the bunker. This act relieved the pressure on both 4 and 5 Platoons, allowing them to reposition with a measure of safety. For his gallantry, Sergeant McKay was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, while Corporal Bailey received the Military Medal.

Peter Harclerode,a noted British historian of the Parachute Regiment who had access to the war diary of the 3rd Battalion and later authored PARA! (Arms &amp; Armour Press, 1993), noted that McKay and his team successfully eliminated several Marine riflemen but failed to neutralize the heavy machine gun.

After Sergeant McKay’s death, Sergeant Fuller, the Senior NCO in the Company HQ, volunteered to take command of 4 Platoon, which included Jason Burt, the only soldier who escaped Sergeant McKay’s action unscathed and combined them with a section from 5 Platoon. Positioning a gun team on the right flank, he led another assault but without success. In recognition of his leadership, Sergeant Fuller was awarded the Military Medal. Later, Corporal McLaughlin crawled to within grenade-throwing range of the machine gun but despite repeated attempts with fragmentation grenades and 66mm rockets, was unable to silence the weapon.

Major Argue&#x27;s B Company ceased firing and devoted their efforts to a withdrawal from &#x27;Fly Half&#x27; due to the difficult situation. Peter Harclerode, went on record, saying that:
&quot;Under covering fire, Nos. 4 and 5 Platoons withdrew, but another man was killed and others wounded in the process. At that point, Lieutenant Colonel Hew Pike and his &#x27;R&#x27; Group arrived on the scene and Major Argue briefed him on the situation. Shortly afterwards, Company Sergeant-Major Weeks reported that both platoons had pulled back to a safe distance and that all the wounded had been recovered. The dead, however, had to be left where they had fallen. Meanwhile, on the southern slope of the objective, the wounded from No. 6 Platoon were being evacuated while the rest remained under cover of the rocks.&quot;
The British 3rd Commando Brigade commander, Brigadier Julian Thompson was reported to have said:

 &quot;I was on the point of withdrawing my Paras from Mount Longdon. We couldn&#x27;t believe that these teenagers disguised as soldiers were causing us to suffer many casualties.&quot;

==== Argentine counterattack ====
Major Carrizo-Salvadores on &#x27;Full Back&#x27; had remained in touch with the Argentine commanders in Port Stanley:
&quot;Around midnight I asked RHQ for infantry reinforcements, and I was given a rifle platoon from Captain Hugo García&#x27;s C Company. First Lieutenant Raúl Fernando Castañeda gathered the sections of his platoon, hooked around First Sergeant Raúl González&#x27;s 2nd Platoon that was already fighting and delivered a counterattack [at about 2am local time]. The Platoon fought with great courage in fierce hand-to-hand combat and the battle raged for two more hours, but gradually the enemy broke contact and withdrew while being engaged by artillery strikes&quot;.

Major Carrizo-Salvadores manoeuvred Castañeda&#x27;s reinforced platoon to close with 4 and 5 Platoons; meanwhile, under the direction of Corporal Jorge Daniel Arribas, part of Castañeda&#x27;s platoon converged on the British aid post. Colour Sergeant Brian Faulkner, seeing that more than 20 wounded Paras on the western slopes of the mountain were about to fall into the hands of Corporal Arribas, deployed anyone fit enough to defend the position.
&quot;I picked four blokes and got up on this high feature, and as I did so this troop of twenty or thirty Argentines&quot; [in fact a reinforced section of 12 to 15 riflemen under Corporal Arribas] &quot;were coming towards us. We just opened fire on them. We don&#x27;t know how many we killed, but they got what they deserved because none of them were left standing when we&#x27;d finished with them.&quot; said Faulkner.
For his conduct, Colour Sergeant Faulkner was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

According to Corporal Jorge Arribas, two men (Privates Jose Luis Del Hierro and Alfredo Gatton) in his rifle section were killed in this action. In fact the Argentines were able to do little more than move forwards and stabilise their existing line.

====British resume the attack====
Following the fighting on &#x27;Fly Half&#x27; and the withdrawal of Nos. 4 and 5 Platoons, 29 Commando Regiment provided artillery support from Mount Kent. Subsequently, the area was flanked, where despite being under heavy fire, the remnants of 4 and 5 Platoons, led by Lieutenant Cox, advanced toward their objective, &#x27;Full Back&#x27;. During this push, they encountered resistance from Casteñeda&#x27;s platoon, specifically Corporal Julio Nardielo Mamani&#x27;s section, sustaining several casualties.  Undeterred, Lieutenant Cox and Private Kevin Connery stormed an Argentine bunker, neutralizing three enemy combatants. As this position was being cleared, Private Gray suffered a headshot injury but refused evacuation until Major Argue had successfully consolidated the troops&#x27; positions on &#x27;Fly Half&#x27;.

Recognising the risk of further losses, the Paras were unable to advance further and were ordered to fall back to the western end of Mount Longdon. Major David Collett&#x27;s A Company was then tasked with moving through B Company to launch an assault on the heavily defended eastern objective, &#x27;Full Back&#x27;, from the west. Support Company provided covering fire during this operation. This coordinated effort aimed to maintain momentum while minimizing further casualties in the face of determined Argentine resistance.  Lieutenant David Wright and Second Lieutenant Ian Moore mustered their platoons near the western summit then cleared the Argentine positions.

During the clearing of these positions by A Company, Corporal McLaughlin was injured by a recoilless gun fired from &quot;Rough Diamond&quot; and while en route to the aid post, both Corporal McLaughlin and Lance Corporal Higgs were killed by an 81mm mortar round fired by First Sergeant Mario Ricardo Alcaide&#x27;s platoon.

The Argentines mounted a strong defence of &quot;Full Back&quot;, where, despite being wounded, Corporal Medina from Castañeda&#x27;s platoon took charge of the recoilless rifle and targeted a MILAN launcher near the western summit killing three Paratroopers: Corporal &quot;Ginge&quot; McCarthy, Privates West and Heddicker. 

By the time the survivors of Castañeda&#x27;s 46-man platoon managed to retreat from the mountain, they were utterly exhausted, having suffered six killed and twenty-one wounded during the counterattack. Among them, Private Leonardo Rondi stood out as he wore a maroon beret taken from a dead of Parachute Regiment soldier. Rondi, who had evaded groups of Paras to deliver messages to Castañeda&#x27;s section leaders after the radio operator was lost, found the body of a Para behind a rock and took the fallen soldier&#x27;s beret and rifle, which he later presented to the Argentine commanders as war trophies.

For his courage and dedication, Rondi was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal.

Lieutenant Hugo Quiroga&#x27;s platoon of engineers suffered half-a-dozen wounded, Platoon Sergeant Juan Carlos Insaurralde badly wounded in the chest, Corporal Walter Calderon wounded in the hand, Private Claudio Jesús Hefner (the radio operator) wounded in the arm and Private Jorge Alejandro Lezcano badly wounded in the hand. The Platoon Commander and Corporal Julio César Oviedo were tossed into the air and knocked unconscious by an explosion with Quiroga only recovering his wits after being given some whisky in the freezing night.

==Aftermath==
The twelve-hour battle was costly for both sides. 3 PARA lost 17 soldiers, including a Royal Engineer attached to the unit. Among the dead, Privates Ian Scrivens and Jason Burt were just 17, and Private Neil Grose was killed on his 18th birthday. Forty British paratroopers were initially reported wounded, with B Company&#x27;s Private Mick Southall noting that only one NCO, Colin Edwards, remained standing in Major Mike Argue&#x27;s company after the intense fighting.

&quot;We took a hammering,&quot; Southall said, with soldiers promoted in the field to replace fallen leaders.

Subsequent Argentine shelling over two days killed four more Paras, a REME craftsman and wounded another seven. Argentine counter-fire on Wireless Ridge during the night of 13–14 June also caused injuries. Earlier on 12 June, Royal Marine Sergeant Peter Thorpe was wounded while assisting injured artillerymen trapped in a Snowcat disabled in a minefield.

The Argentines suffered 31 dead, 120 wounded, and 50 taken prisoner.

Lance-Corporal Vincent Bramley was patrolling the western half of Mount Longdon when he was confronted with the full horror of the night combat. The 3 PARA NCO and keen writer stumbled upon the bodies of five Paratroopers killed by Neirotti&#x27;s 3rd Platoon.
&quot;A few bullets whizzed overhead and smashed into the rocks. A corporal shouted that Tumbledown was firing at us. We ran into a tight gap in the path &quot;[and] &quot;came to an abrupt halt, as it was a dead end. Four or five bodies lay sprawled there, close together. This time they were our own men: the camouflaged Para smocks hit my eyes immediately. CSM &quot;[Company-Sergeant-Major] &quot;Weeks was standing over them like a guardian, screaming at some of his men to cover the further end of the path and a small crest. The CSM and Sergeant P &quot;[Pettinger] &quot;exchanged quick words. I wasn&#x27;t listening; my mind was totally occupied with looking into the crags for the enemy. I turned and looked at our own lads, dead on the ground, mowed down when they tried to rush through this gap. I felt both anger and sadness. The CSM&#x27;s face showed the strain of having seen most of his company either wounded or shot dead. That night&#x27;s fighting was written in every line of his face.&quot;

<doc id="529953" wikidata="Q322177" url="?curid=529953" title="Ablation">
<text>Ablation ( – removal) is the removal or destruction of something from an object by vaporization, chipping, erosive processes, or by other means. Examples of ablative materials are described below, including spacecraft material for ascent and atmospheric reentry, ice and snow in glaciology, biological tissues in medicine and passive fire protection materials.

==Artificial intelligence==
In artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning, ablation is the removal of a component of an AI system. The term is by analogy with biology: removal of components of an organism.

==Biology==

Biological ablation is the removal of a biological structure or functionality.

Genetic ablation is another term for gene silencing, in which gene expression is abolished through the alteration or deletion of genetic sequence information. In cell ablation, individual cells in a population or culture are destroyed or removed. Both can be used as experimental tools, as in loss-of-function experiments.

==Medicine==

In medicine, ablation is the removal of a part of biological tissue, usually by surgery. Surface ablation of the skin (dermabrasion, also called resurfacing because it induces regeneration) can be carried out by chemicals (chemoablation), by lasers (laser ablation), by freezing (cryoablation), or by electricity (fulguration). Its purpose is to remove skin spots, aged skin, wrinkles, thus rejuvenating it. Surface ablation is also employed in otolaryngology for several kinds of surgery, such as the one for snoring. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a method of removing aberrant tissue from within the body via minimally invasive procedures, it is used to cure a variety of cardiac arrhythmia such as supraventricular tachycardia, Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (WPW), ventricular tachycardia, and more recently as management of atrial fibrillation. The term is often used in the context of laser ablation, a process in which a laser dissolves a material&#x27;s molecular bonds. For a laser to ablate tissues, the power density or fluence must be high, otherwise thermocoagulation occurs, which is simply thermal vaporization of the tissues.

Rotablation is a type of arterial cleansing that consists of inserting a tiny, diamond-tipped, drill-like device into the affected artery to remove fatty deposits or plaque. The procedure is used in the treatment of coronary heart disease to restore blood flow.

Microwave ablation (MWA) is similar to RFA but at higher frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation removes tissue from within the body noninvasively.

Bone marrow ablation is a process whereby the human bone marrow cells are eliminated in preparation for a bone marrow transplant. This is performed using high-intensity chemotherapy and total body irradiation. As such, it has nothing to do with the vaporization techniques described in the rest of this article.

Ablation of brain tissue is used for treating certain neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and sometimes for psychiatric disorders as well.

Recently, some researchers reported successful results with genetic ablation. In particular, genetic ablation is potentially a much more efficient method of removing unwanted cells, such as tumor cells, because large numbers of animals lacking specific cells could be generated. Genetically ablated lines can be maintained for a prolonged period of time and shared within the research community. Researchers at Columbia University report of reconstituted caspases combined from &quot;C. elegans&quot; and humans, which maintain a high degree of target specificity. The genetic ablation techniques described could prove useful in battling cancer.

== Electro-ablation ==
Electro-ablation, is a process that removes material from a metallic workpiece to reduce surface roughness.

Electro-ablation breaks through highly resistive oxide surfaces, such as those found on titanium and other exotic metals and alloys without melting the underlying non-oxidised metal or alloy. This allows very quick surface finishing

The process is capable of providing surface finishing for a wide range of exotic and widely used metals and alloys, including: titanium, stainless steel, niobium, chromium–cobalt, Inconel, aluminium, and a range of widely available steels and alloys.

Electro-ablation is very effective at achieving high levels of surface finishing in holes, valleys and hidden or internal surfaces on metallic workpieces (parts).

The process is particularly applicable to components produced by additive manufacturing process, such as 3D-printed metals. These components tend to be produced with roughness levels well above 5–20 micron. Electro-ablation can be used to quickly reduce the surface roughness to less than 0.8 micron, allowing the post-process to be used for volume production surface finishing.

==Glaciology==

In glaciology and meteorology, ablation—the opposite of accumulation—refers to all processes that remove snow, ice, or water from a glacier or snowfield. Ablation refers to the melting of snow or ice that runs off the glacier, evaporation, sublimation, calving, or erosive removal of snow by wind. Air temperature is typically the dominant control of ablation, with precipitation exercising secondary control. In a temperate climate during ablation season, ablation rates typically average around 2 mm/h. Where solar radiation is the dominant cause of snow ablation (e.g., if air temperatures are low under clear skies), characteristic ablation textures such as suncups and penitentes may develop on the snow surface. Ablation can refer to mass loss from the upper surface of a glacier or ocean-driven melt and calving on the face of a glacier terminus.

Ablation can refer either to the processes removing ice and snow or to the quantity of ice and snow removed.

Debris-covered glaciers have also been shown to greatly impact the ablation process. There is a thin debris layer that can be located on the top of glaciers that intensifies the ablation process below the ice. The debris-covered parts of a glacier that is experiencing ablation are sectioned into three categories which include ice cliffs, ponds, and debris. These three sections allow scientists to measure the heat digested by the debris-covered area and is calculated. The calculations are dependent on the area and net absorbed heat amounts in regards to the entire debris-covered zones. These types of calculations are done to various glaciers to understand and analyze future patterns of melting.

Moraine (glacial debris) is moved by natural processes that allow for down-slope movement of materials on the glacier body. It is noted that if the slope of a glacier is too high then the debris will continue to move along the glacier to a further location. The sizes and locations of glaciers vary around the world, so depending on the climate and physical geography the varieties of debris can differ. The size and magnitude of the debris is dependent on the area of glacier and can vary from dust-size fragments to blocks as large as a house.

There have been many experiments done to demonstrate the effect of debris on the surface of glaciers. Yoshiyuki Fujii, a professor at the National Institute of Polar Research, designed an experiment that showed ablation rate was accelerated under a thin debris layer and was retarded under a thick one as compared with that of a natural snow surface. This science is significant due to the importance of long-term availability of water resources and assess glacier response to climate change. Natural resource availability is a major drive behind research conducted in regards to the ablation process and overall study of glaciers.

==Laser ablation==

 Laser ablation is greatly affected by the nature of the material and its ability to absorb energy, therefore the wavelength of the ablation laser should have a minimum absorption depth. While these lasers can average a low power, they can offer peak intensity and fluence given by:

:formula_1

while the peak power is

:formula_2

Surface ablation of the cornea for several types of eye refractive surgery is now common, using an excimer laser system (LASIK and LASEK). Since the cornea does not grow back, laser is used to remodel the cornea refractive properties to correct refraction errors, such as astigmatism, myopia, and hyperopia. Laser ablation is also used to remove part of the uterine wall in women with menstruation and adenomyosis problems in a process called endometrial ablation.

Researchers have demonstrated a successful technique for ablating subsurface tumors with minimal thermal damage to surrounding healthy tissue, by using a focused laser beam from an ultra-short pulse diode laser source.

==Marine surface coatings==
Antifouling paints and other related coatings are routinely used to prevent the buildup of microorganisms and other animals, such as barnacles for the bottom hull surfaces of recreational, commercial and military sea vessels. Ablative paints are often utilized for this purpose to prevent the dilution or deactivation of the antifouling agent. Over time, the paint will slowly decompose in the water, exposing fresh antifouling compounds on the surface. Engineering the antifouling agents and the ablation rate can produce long-lived protection from the deleterious effects of biofouling.

==Passive fire protection==
Firestopping and fireproofing products can be ablative in nature. This can mean endothermic materials, or merely materials that are sacrificial and become &quot;spent&quot; over time while exposed to fire, such as silicone firestop products.
Given sufficient time under fire or heat conditions, these products char away, crumble, and disappear. The idea is to put enough of this material in the way of the fire that a level of fire-resistance rating can be maintained, as demonstrated in a fire test. Ablative materials usually have a large concentration of organic matter that is reduced by fire to ashes. In the case of silicone, organic rubber surrounds very finely divided silica dust (up to 380 m2 of combined surface area of all the dust particles per gram of this dust). When the organic rubber is exposed to fire, it burns to ash and leaves behind the silica dust with which the product started.

== Protoplanetary disk ablation ==
Protoplanetary disks are rotating circumstellar disks of dense gas and dust surrounding young, newly formed stars. Shortly after star formation, stars often have leftover surrounding material that is still gravitationally bound to them, forming primitive disks that orbit around the star&#x27;s equator – not too dissimilarly from the rings of Saturn. This occurs because the decrease in the protostellar material&#x27;s radius during formation increases angular momentum, which means that this remaining material gets whipped into a flattened circumstellar disk around the star. This circumstellar disk may eventually mature into what is referred to as a protoplanetary disk: a disk of gas, dust, ice and other materials from which planetary systems may form. In these disks, orbiting matter starts to accrete in the colder mid-plane of the disk from dust grains and ices sticking together. These small accretions grow from pebbles to rocks to early baby planets, called planetesimals, then protoplanets, and eventually, full planets.

As it is believed that massive stars may play a role in actively triggering star formation (by introducing gravitational instabilities amongst other factors), it is plausible that young, smaller stars with disks may be living relatively nearby to older, more massive stars. This has already been confirmed through observations to be the case in certain clusters, e.g. in the Trapezium cluster. Since massive stars tend to collapse through supernovae at the end of their lives, research is now investigating what role the shockwave of such an explosion, and the resulting supernova remnant (SNR), would play if it occurred in the line of fire of a protoplanetary disk. According to computationally modelled simulations, a SNR striking a protoplanetary disk would result in significant ablation of the disk, and this ablation would strip a significant amount of protoplanetary material from the disk – but not necessarily destroy the disk entirely. This is an important point because a disk that survives such an interaction with sufficient material leftover to form a planetary system may inherit an altered disk chemistry from the SNR, which could have effects on the planetary systems that later form.

==Spaceflight==

In spacecraft design, ablation is used to both cool and protect mechanical parts and/or payloads that would otherwise be damaged by extremely high temperatures. Two principal applications are heat shields for spacecraft entering a planetary atmosphere from space and cooling of rocket engine nozzles. Examples include the Apollo Command Module that protected astronauts from the heat of atmospheric reentry and the Kestrel second stage rocket engine designed for exclusive use in an environment of space vacuum since no heat convection is possible.

In a basic sense, ablative material is designed so that instead of heat being transmitted into the structure of the spacecraft, only the outer surface of the material bears the majority of the heating effect. The outer surface chars and burns away – but quite slowly, only gradually exposing new fresh protective material beneath. The heat is carried away from the spacecraft by the gases generated by the ablative process, and never penetrates the surface material, so the metallic and other sensitive structures they protect, remain at a safe temperature. As the surface burns and disperses into space, the remaining solid material continues to insulate the craft from ongoing heat and superheated gases. The thickness of the ablative layer is calculated to be sufficient to survive the heat it will encounter on its mission.

There is an entire branch of spaceflight research involving the search for new fireproofing materials to achieve the best ablative performance; this function is critical to protect the spacecraft occupants and payload from otherwise excessive heat loading. The same technology is used in some passive fire protection applications, in some cases by the same vendors, who offer different versions of these fireproofing products, some for aerospace and some for structural fire protection.

<text>The Esquiline Hill (; ; ) is one of the Seven Hills of Rome. Its southernmost cusp is the &quot;Oppius&quot; (Oppian Hill).
==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Esquiline&quot; is still under much debate. One view is that the hill was named after the abundance of (Italian oaks) growing there. Another view is that, during Rome&#x27;s infancy, the Capitolium, the Palatinum, and the northern fringes of the Caelian were the most-populated areas of the city, whose inhabitants were considered (&quot;in-towners&quot;); those who inhabited the external regions – Aurelian, Oppius, Cispius, Fagutal – were considered (&quot;suburbanites&quot;).

==History==
The Esquiline Hill includes three prominent spurs, which are sometimes called &quot;hills&quot; as well:

*Cispian (&quot;Cispius&quot;) – northern spur
*Oppian (&quot;Oppius&quot;) – southern spur
*Fagutal (&quot;Fagutalis&quot;) – western spur

Rising above the valley in which was later built the Colosseum, the Esquiline was a fashionable residential district.

According to Livy, the settlement on the Esquiline was expanded during the reign of Servius Tullius, Rome&#x27;s sixth king, in the 6th century BC. The king also moved his residence to the hill in order to increase its respectability.

The political advisor and art patron Maecenas (70–8 BC) sited his gardens, the first in the Hellenistic-Persian garden style in Rome, on the Esquiline Hill, atop the Servian Wall and its adjoining necropolis. It contained terraces, libraries and other aspects of Roman culture. At the Oppius, Nero (37 AD–68 AD) confiscated property to build his extravagant, mile-long Golden House, and later still Trajan (53–117) constructed his bath complex, both of whose remains are visible today. The 3rd-century Horti Liciniani, a group of gardens (including the relatively well-preserved nymphaeum formerly identified as the non-extant Temple of Minerva Medica), were probably constructed on the Esquiline Hill. Farther to the northeast, at the summit of the &quot;Cispius&quot;, is the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.

In 1781, the first known copy of the marble statue of a discus thrower – the &quot;Discobolus&quot; of Myron – was discovered on the Roman property of the Massimo family, the Villa Palombara, on the Esquiline Hill. The famous Esquiline Treasure, now in the British Museum, was found on the Esquiline Hill.

<text>The Caelian Hill ( ; ; ) is one of the famous seven hills of Rome.

== Geography ==
The Caelian Hill is a moderately long promontory about long, to wide, and tall in the park near the Temple of Claudius. The hill overlooks a plateau from which the Esquiline, Viminal and Quirinal hills also arise.

&quot;Caeliolus&quot; (also &quot;Caeliculus&quot; or &quot;Caelius Minor&quot;) corresponds to a section of the hill, maybe the westernmost one, towards the valley that houses the Colosseum, or the one now occupied by the Basilica dei Santi Quattro Coronati.

==History==
=== Archaic age ===

Under the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the entire population of Alba Longa was forcibly resettled on the Caelian Hill. According to a tradition recounted by Varro, the hill received its name from the Etruscan folk hero Caelius Vibenna, because he either settled there or was honored posthumously by his friend Servius Tullius. Other authors have linked the name to the Latin &quot;caelum&quot;, &quot;heaven&quot;. Nevertheless, the former name of the hill probably was &quot;Querquetulanus mons&quot; due to the abundance of oaks (Latin: &quot;Quercus&quot;). Scholarship suggests that there existed the ethnic name &quot;Querquetulani&quot; as a designation of the previous inhabitants of Caelius, in pre-Etruscan times.
&quot;Mons Caelius&quot; would have been included in the city perimeter under the reign of Ancus Marcius. The list of &quot;Septimontium&quot; mentions it, and it was part of the 1st city quarter (&quot;Suburana&quot;) in the division made by Servius Tullius. In the later Augustan division, it became the Regio II Caelimontium.

A trace of the archaic period remains in the memory of cults of woods and sources, such as that of the nymph Egeria in the wood of Camenae, just outside Porta Capena. Numa Pompilius is said to have been particularly devoted to his sanctuary.

=== Republican age ===
In the Republican age (as well in Imperial Rome) the Caelian Hill was a fashionable residential district and the site of residences of the wealthy. A section of Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, &quot;Who Was the First to Encrust the Walls of Houses at Rome with Marble&quot;, attests to this. Mamurra, a soldier who served under Julius Caesar in Gaul and profited tremendously from corruption, achieved this expensive feat on the Caelian Hill; Horace and Catullus mocked him accordingly. 

Most of the hill was outside the boundaries of the pomerium, therefore temples to foreign divinities were allowed to be built, such as the Temple of Minerva Capta or the old Sacellum of Diana, outside the Servian Wall.

Some sepulchres, such as the burial chamber in Via Celimontana, just before Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano, date back to this period.

=== Imperial age ===
Under Augustus the Caelian Hill was one of the 14 divisions of the town, called &quot;Caelimontium&quot;. The area between the Lateran and Porta Maggiore was included in the v Regio (&quot;Esquiliae&quot;), though physically it is part of the hill.

On the higher point of the side facing the Colosseum, the Temple of Claudius was erected on a huge supporting platform. It was dedicated to the Emperor Claudius and begun by his widow Agrippina after his death and deification in 54 AD; it was not ultimately finished until the reign of Vespasian. Nero added a grand nymphaeum (tiered water fountain) to the eastern retaining wall of this platform, with semi-circular and rectangular niches. The water to supply this fountain was supplied by a special branch of the Aqua Claudia, called the &quot;Arcus Neroniani&quot;, which extended 2 kilometres west from the Claudia at Porta Maggiore and terminated on the southern side of the Caelian Hill in a structure called the &quot;Aqueductium&quot;. The &quot;Aqueductium&quot; distributed the water via conduits to reservoirs behind the nymphaeum and to the site of the temple.

The remains found in the area of the hill allow one to reconstruct a conspicuous housing phase in the second half of the 2nd century AD, while former buildings of the 1st century BC were probably destroyed by a fire in AD 27. 

Jerome alleges that Marcus Aurelius was born on the Caelian Hill in AD 121. 

In the 4th century rich &quot;domus&quot;, surrounded by vast parks, stood on the hill, such as the ones belonging to the Symmachi (near which rose the Basilica hilariana) and Tetrici families, as well as the &quot;domus Faustae&quot;, perhaps belonging to the wife of Constantine I. The property of the Annii, of Domitia Lucilla Minor (the mother of Marcus Aurelius) and of the Quintilii became part of the Domus Vectiliana of Commodus.

In the interurban area of the hill several barracks were built for the troops stationed in the capital: in the site of the Basilica of Saint Stephen in the Round there were the &quot;Castra Peregrina&quot; (built under Trajan and restored several times in the following centuries), close to a large house of the Valerii (&quot;domus Valerii&quot;). Opposite, stood the headquarters of the V Cohort of the Vigiles (&quot;stazio cohortis V vigilum&quot;).

In a land possession of the Laterani family Septimius Severus built between 193 and 197 the &quot;castra nova equitum singularium&quot;, a new barrack for the knights corps of the imperial guard, opposite the former barrack built under Trajan (&quot;castra priora equitum singularium&quot;). When Constantine I dissolved the corps, the new basilica dedicated to the Messiah, which later became the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, partially occupied the area of the Severian camp.

The decisive battle in the 271 revolt of mint workers, led by Felicissimus, took place on the Caelian Hill. It is possible that this uprising was somehow connected with the senatorial and equestrian classes, as Aurelian executed several senators.

The buildings of the Caelian hill were badly damaged during the sack of Alaric in 410; starting from this period, the hill was subject to increasing abandonment and ruralization.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the 6th century it was part of the II Roman ecclesiastical region due to its proximity to the Lateran basilica, so much so that the toponym of &quot;Laterano&quot; was often used for the entire hill. The erection of the &quot;Patriarchium&quot;, which probably dates back to the 6th Century, gave rise to the creation of various &quot;tituli&quot; (the oldest places of Christian worship, often within private houses) and &quot;xenodochia&quot; (centers for the assistance and reception of pilgrims and sick).

New churches continued to be built, initially to supersede the former &quot;tituli&quot;, later independently, such as the Basilica of Saints John and Paul, the Basilica of the Four Crowned Martyrs, the Basilica of St. Mary in Domnica, the Basilica of St. Stephen in the Round, the church of San Giovanni a Porta Latina, the church of San Gregorio al Celio, the church of San Tommaso in Formis, the church of San Sisto Vecchio

Monasteries, often surrounded by estates and gardens, were also founded on the hill, as well as some towers of noble families, mainly in the 10th and 11th centuries. A new destruction was suffered with the sack of 1084.

From the 12th century, it was part of the &quot;Regio Montium&quot;, which even extended to the Quirinal Hill.

===Later history===

Today the Caelian Hill is included in the Rione of the same name and, continuing its vocation for assistance, hosts the Policlinico Militare del Celio, built on a project by Salvatore Bianchi and Filippo Laccetti. 

George Santayana lived in a room at the Convent of English Blue Sisters on the Caelian Hill from 1912 until his death.

<text>The Viminal Hill ( ; ; ) is the smallest of the famous Seven Hills of Rome. A finger-shape cusp pointing toward central Rome between the Quirinal Hill to the northwest and the Esquiline Hill to the southeast, it is home to the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera and the Termini Railway Station.

At the top of the Viminal Hill is the Palace of Viminale that hosts the headquarters of the Ministry of the Interior; currently the term &quot;Il Viminale&quot; means the Ministry of the Interior.

According to Livy, the hill first became part of the city of Rome, along with the Quirinal Hill, during the reign of Servius Tullius, Rome&#x27;s sixth king, in the 6th century BC. The name of the hill derives from Latin &quot;viminalis&quot; (“pertaining to osiers”), from &quot;&quot; (“a pliant twig, osier”).

<text>Paul Sandner Moller (born December 11, 1936, in Fruitvale, British Columbia, Canada) is a Canadian engineer who has spent over fifty years developing the Moller Skycar personal vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle. The engine technology developed for the Skycar has also been adapted as a UAV platform called the &quot;aerobot&quot;. The rotapower engine itself has been spun off to a separate Moller company, Freedom Motors.

==Education==
Moller holds several degrees and certifications:
* D.A.M. (Diploma Aircraft Maintenance), Provincial Institute of Technology and Art, 1957
* D.A.E. (Diploma Aeronautical Engineering), Provincial Institute of Technology and Art 1958
* Master of Engineering, McGill University, 1961
* Ph.D. in Aerodynamics, McGill University, 1963

==Career==

In 1972, Moller founded Supertrapp Industries to market his invention of an engine silencing system. Moller sold Supertrapp in 1988 in order to fund development of his Skycar and its rotapower engine. 

In 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Moller for civil fraud (&quot;Securities And Exchange Commission v. Moller International, Inc., and Paul S. Moller, Defendants&quot;) in connection with value of shares after the initial public offering of stock, and for making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of the Skycar. Moller settled this lawsuit without admitting guilt by agreeing to a permanent injunction against claiming projected worth of Moller International stock and paying US$50,000. The shareholders of Moller International - collectively known as SOMI (&quot;Shareholders Of Moller International&quot;) banded together on a website (no longer active) to tell the Moller-side of the SEC issue.

Moller was a professor of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering, from 1963 to 1975, at the University of California, Davis and lives in Davis. He was featured in &quot;Popular Science&quot;″s January 2005 issue and appeared on the radio show &quot;Coast To Coast AM&quot;.

In 2007, Moller announced that the M200G Volantor, a successor to the Moller Skycar, would hopefully be on the market in the United States by early 2008. His proposed Autovolantor model includes an all-electric version powered by Altairnano batteries.

Moller is President of Aerobotics Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Moller International, which designed an aerial system for video inspection of bridges, for Caltrans. The project was suspended in 2008 after significant issues were identified with the test design.

Moller&#x27;s credibility has been questioned in recent years because of the vaporware nature of his creations. In April 2009, the &quot;National Post&quot; characterized the Moller M400 Skycar as a &#x27;failure&#x27;, and described the Moller company as &quot;no longer believable enough to gain investors&quot;.

On May 18, 2009, Moller filed for personal protection under the Chapter 11 reorganization provisions of the federal bankruptcy law, however Moller International (corporation) did not file for bankruptcy and continues to do business . 

By 2009, Moller International had accumulated a deficit of $43.1 million.

<text>Fictional [[Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom|colleges]] are perennially popular in modern novels, allowing the author much greater licence when describing the more intimate activities of a Cambridge college and a way of placing events that might not be permitted by actual Cambridge geography.

Below is a list of some of the fictional colleges of the University of Cambridge.

*All Saints College, &quot;The Man in Room 17&quot;, &quot;The Green Man&quot; by Kingsley Amis, mentioned briefly in &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; by Douglas Adams and in &quot;Dreaming of the Bones&quot; by Deborah Crombie.
*Boniface College, Cambridge, &quot;Pendennis&quot; by William Thackeray, inspired by his time at Cambridge and home to the poet Sprott.
*Brakespeare College, &quot;Manalive&quot; by G. K. Chesterton
*Canterbury College, &quot;The Mezzotint&quot; by M. R. James
*Fawkes College, in the novels of Mary Selby/Joanna Bell. The College features her book &quot;Gargoyles and Port&quot;, in which it is rival to the neighbouring St Alupent&#x27;s College
*Fisher College, &quot;The Cambridge Murders&quot; by Dilwyn Rees, situated between real-life St John&#x27;s College and Trinity College
*Flopsy College, In the episode Return of the Mummy of children&#x27;s spy series &quot;M.I. High&quot;
*Haworth College, Dr Rose Fenemore in &quot;Stormy Petrel&quot; by Mary Stewart is described as the College&#x27;s English tutor, though most of the novel is set on the Isle of Mull 
*Hawkins College, The longstanding rivals of Old College in the series of PorterGirl books and blog of the same name written by Lucy Brazier 
*Humber College, Hugo Lamb, narrator of the second chapter in David Mitchell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bone Clocks&quot;, is an undergraduate at Humber, a medieval college in the city centre 
*Lancaster College, various books by Simon Raven. Bears more than a passing resemblance to King&#x27;s College, founded by Henry VI of the House of Lancaster
*Lauds College, various books by Susan Howatch. Fictionally contains Cambridge Cathedral, so is similar to Christ Church, Oxford. Charles Ashworth was a fellow of the College and many other characters studied there. Named after William Laud, controversial 17th century Archbishop of Canterbury
*Marcian College, Raisley Conyngham&#x27;s old college in &quot;In the Image of God&quot; by Simon Raven. Located between the Round Church and Portugal Place, i.e. between St John&#x27;s and Jesus. Described by its head porter as &quot;the least distinguished college in the kingdom, with the possible exception of Hertford College, Oxford&quot;
*Old College, fictional college from the &quot;PorterGirl&quot; books and blog, written by Lucy Brazier
*Pelby College, spoof college that Cambridge students use as an &quot;unmistakable landmark&quot; when giving directions to tourists. By convention it is located somewhere between Magdalene and St John&#x27;s.
*[[Porterhouse Blue|Porterhouse College]], &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot; and &quot;Grantchester Grind&quot; by Tom Sharpe. The name suggests Peterhouse, though it is also a pun on college porters and porterhouse steaks. It is also reputedly based loosely on Pembroke, Sharpe&#x27;s alma mater or Corpus Christi which is next door and its location is somewhere near Peterhouse and Pembroke. Despite this, however, filming for the television series took place at Sidney Sussex College. A Porterhouse College in the (fictional) University of Carrbridge, Inverness-shire has been used in University of Cambridge mathematics exam questions.
*Rachel Ambrose College, Christminster, &quot;Culture Shock&quot; (Duckworth 1988) by Valerie Grosvenor Myer, a graduate of Newnham, and sometime Associate of Lucy Cavendish, which, as a college for mature women students, it most resembles
*St Agatha&#x27;s College, &quot;The Wyndham Case&quot; (1993), &quot;A Piece of Justice&quot; (1995), &quot;Debts of Dishonour&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Bad Quarto&quot; (2007) by Jill Paton Walsh, located between Castle Mound and Chesterton Lane
*St Alupent&#x27;s College, in the novels of Mary Selby/Joanna Bell. The College is the setting of her book &quot;Gargoyles and Port&quot;. The author studied at Gonville and Caius College. She named St Alupent&#x27;s after a branded asthma syrup available on the NHS at the time

*St Matthew&#x27;s College, &quot;The Green Man&quot; by Kingsley Amis, next door to St Catharine&#x27;s College. Also in various works by Stephen Fry - in which it is a loosely disguised version of Queens&#x27; College, revealed by names of bridges and courts
*St Maud&#x27;s College, in the short-lived BBC sitcom &quot;Honey for Tea&quot;. Exterior shots are of Clare College
*St Paul&#x27;s College, located on St Andrew&#x27;s Street, between Christ&#x27;s and Emmanuel, in &quot;The Pink and the Grey&quot; by Anthony Camber
*St Radegund&#x27;s College, an all-female college in &quot;Hearts and Mind&quot; by Rosy Thornton
*St Stephen&#x27;s College, &quot;For the Sake of Elena&quot; by Elizabeth George, located between Trinity College and Trinity Hall, modelled on the latter. In the BBC adaptation of the Inspector Lynley Mysteries, St John&#x27;s College was used as the setting
*St Swithin&#x27;s College, In James Hilton&#x27;s &quot;Random Harvest&quot;, the college attended by Charles Ranier, the main character, and a decade later by Harrison, the narrator. Founded in the latter 16th century

*Wetmarsh College, subject of an operetta by Mark Wainwright and Roland Anderson entitled &quot;Wetmarsh College, or, Dr Middlebottom&quot;, first staged at the ADC Theatre, Cambridge, in 2005 (Wetmarsh is never explicitly said to be in Cambridge, but Wainwright&#x27;s libretto [albeit including a little Oxford terminology] and the place of its composition and first performance make it fairly clear)
* An unnamed college in C. P. Snow&#x27;s &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; series, including &quot;The Masters&quot;, in which he states that he &quot;never liked geographical inventions such as Christminster&quot;, referring to the Oxford surrogate in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex.
* An unnamed college in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;High Table, Lower Orders&quot;

<doc id="529972" wikidata="Q7554318" url="?curid=529972" title="Software licensing audit">
<text>A software licensing audit or software compliance audit is an important sub-set of software asset management and component of corporate risk management. When a company is unaware of what software is installed and being used on its machines, it can result in multiple layers of exposure.

The primary benefits a corporation receives from performing a software licensing audit are greater control and various forms of cost savings.
The audit is used both as an efficiency mechanism to improve software distribution within an organization and as a preventative mechanism to avoid copyright infringement prosecution by software companies. Software licensing audits are an important part of software asset management, but also serve as a method of corporate reputation management by ensuring that the company is operating within legal and ethical guidelines.

Software audits should not be confused with code audits, which are carried out on the source code of a software project.

== Challenges ==
If the auditing company self-dependently scans the code base, one of the serious challenges is the license changes between versions. Some software libraries start with one license and later switch into another. The typical examples are switching from the single permissive license to the dual licensing model (the choice between strong reciprocal or paid commercial) as for iText, switching from more reciprocal to more permissive license (as for Qt Extended) and open sourcing the previously commercial code (as for OpenJDK). In such cases it is not enough to detect that some library or code fragment has been used - an exact used version must be correctly identified. Further difficulties may arise if the library owner removes the obsolete versions (that were under different license) from the public sources.

Some licenses (like LGPL) have very different conditions for the simple linking and creating of the derivative works. In such case the proper audit must take into consideration if the library has been linked or the derivative work (custom branch) has been created.

Finally, some software packages may internally contain fragments of the source code (such as source code of the Oracle Java) that may be provided only for reference or have various other licenses, not necessary compatible with the internal policies of the company. If the software team actually does not use (or even is not aware) about such fragments, this must be viewed differently from the case if they would be directly linked.

All these issues are relatively easy to resolve if the auditing group cooperates with the software team that normally should know the used versions and so on. If the software team is not trusted, an incompetent audit may find many &quot;inconsistencies&quot; and &quot;violations&quot; where there are not any.

==Software asset management==

Software asset management is an organization process, which is outlined in ISO/IEC 19770-1. It is also now embraced within ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Management Systems - Requirements and ISO/IEC 17799:2005 Information Technology - Security Techniques - Code of Practice for Information Security Management.

Software asset management is a comprehensive strategy that has to be addressed from top to bottom in an organization to be effective, to minimize risk.
A software compliance audit is an important sub-set of software asset management and is covered in the above referenced standards. At its simplest it involves the following:

# Identification of Software Assets.
# Verifying the Software Assets including licenses, usage, and rights.
# Identifying gaps that may exist between what exists on the installations, and the licenses possessed, and the rights of usage.
# Taking action to close any gaps.
# Recording the results in a centralized location with Proof Of Purchase records.
The audit process itself should be a continuing action, and modern SAM software identifies what is installed, where it is installed, its usage, and provides a reconciliation of this discovery against usage. This is a very useful means of controlling software installations and lowering the costs of licensing. Large organizations could not do this without discovery and inventory applications.

From time to time internal or external (by major accounting firms) audits may take a forensic approach to establish what is installed on the computers in an organization with the purpose of ensuring that it is all legal and authorized and to ensure that its process of processing transactions or events is correct. Though one might be confronted with a software vendor audit by fair contractual and legal means, one should know and reserve one&#x27;s crucial rights in an audit situation as well.

Software audits are a component of corporate risk management, and they certainly minimize the risk of prosecution for copyright infringement due to use of unlicensed software. Most vendors permit the company to settle without prosecution though in serious cases, prosecutions certainly occur. In addition with a strict software usage policy the risk of computer viruses are minimized by preventing uncontrolled software copying.

==Organizations==

Vendors subscribe to organizations such as the Federation Against Software Theft (FAST) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA) as a means of providing an industry approach to control piracy, counterfeiting, and illegal use of software. They publicize campaigns against illegal use of software and reward any employees who notify them of any breaches which result in successful prosecution and/or recovery of license fees.

<doc id="529974" wikidata="Q10384227" url="?curid=529974" title="Mediated transport">
<text>Mediated transport refers to cellular transport mediated at the lipid bilayer through phospholipid interactions, or more frequently membrane transport proteins. Substances in the human body may be hydrophobic, electrophilic, contain a positively or negatively charge, or have another property. As such there are times when those substances may not be able to pass over the cell membrane using protein-independent movement. The cell membrane is imbedded with many membrane transport proteins that allow such molecules to travel in and out of the cell. There are three types of mediated transporters: uniport, symport, and antiport. Things that can be transported are nutrients, ions, glucose, etc, all depending on the needs of the cell. One example of a uniport mediated transport protein is GLUT1. GLUT1 is a transmembrane protein, which means it spans the entire width of the cell membrane, connecting the extracellular and intracellular region. It is a uniport system because it specifically transports glucose in only one direction, down its concentration gradient across the cell membrane. 

Another example of a uniporter mediated transport protein is microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) who is responsible for catalyzing the assembly of the triglyceride rich lipoproteins as well mediating their release from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. What is distinguishable about this specific transfer protein is that it requires the protein PRAP1 to bind to the lipoprotein to facilitate the transport of said lipoprotein. MTTP only recognizes the PRAP1-lipoprotein complex and only then will it catalyze the transport reaction. In a way, the PRAP1 protein acts as a signal for MTTP. The importance of such interactions implies that mediated transport is not only dependent on transmembrane proteins but can also require the presence of additional non-transmembrane proteins. For instance, studies show that in the absence of a fully functional PRAP1 protein, MTTP fails to transport specific lipoproteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. 

An example of a symporter mediated transport protein is SGLT1, a sodium/glucose co-transporter protein that is mainly found in the intestinal tract. The SGLT1 protein is a symporter system because it passes both glucose and sodium in the same direction, from the lumen of the intestine to inside the intestinal cells. 

An example of an antiporter mediated transport protein is the sodium-calcium antiporter, a transport protein involved in keeping the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium ions in the cells, low. This transport protein is an antiporter system because it transports three sodium ions across the plasma membrane in exchange for a calcium ion, which is transported in the opposite direction.
Mechanism of transport. A molecule will bind to a transporter protein, altering its shape. The change of shape or other added substances such as ATP will, in turn, cause the transport protein to alter its shape and release the molecule onto the other side of the cell membrane.   
==Types of Transport==
Source:

* Facilitated diffusion
* Active transport

== Mutations in Transport Proteins ==
The importance of mediated transport proteins is visualized with the presence of mutations that render the transport proteins nonfunctional. A prime example of this are mutations found within the Archain 1 gene which codes for the transport proteins COPI and COPII. The main function of these transport proteins is to facilitate the passage of molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus, and vice versa. The mutated ARCN1 gene gives rise to abnormal COPI who fails to transport type I collagen and leads to the secretion of collagen. Due to the fact that type I collagen is the main ingredient of connective tissue, such mutations are the cause of numerous severe skeletal disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta and cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia. Various variations of these disorders are characterized by visible physical dysplasia. This example highlights the importance of transport proteins, not only as a means for the passage of specific molecules across a membrane, but for proper bodily development.

<text>The rating percentage index, commonly known as the RPI, is a quantity used to rank sports teams based upon a team&#x27;s wins and losses and its strength of schedule. It is one of the sports rating systems by which NCAA basketball, baseball, softball, hockey, soccer, lacrosse, and volleyball teams are ranked. This system was in use from 1981 through 2018 to aid in the selecting and seeding of teams appearing in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament as well as in the women&#x27;s tournament from its inception in 1982 through 2020.

During the 2018 offseason, the NCAA announced that the RPI would no longer be used in the selection process for the Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Effective immediately, it was replaced with the NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET).

In its current formulation, the index comprises a team&#x27;s winning percentage (25%), its opponents&#x27; winning percentage (50%), and the winning percentage of those opponents&#x27; opponents (25%). The opponents&#x27; winning percentage and the winning percentage of those opponents&#x27; opponents both comprise the strength of schedule (SOS). Thus, the SOS accounts for 75% of the RPI calculation and is 2/3 its opponents&#x27; winning percentage and 1/3 its opponents&#x27; opponents&#x27; winning percentages.

The RPI lacks theoretical justification from a statistical standpoint. Other ranking systems which include the margin of victory of games played or other statistics in addition to the win/loss results have been shown to be a better predictor of the outcomes of future games. However, because the margin of victory has been manipulated in the past by teams or individuals in the context of gambling, the RPI can be used to mitigate motivation for such manipulation.

Some feel that the heavy emphasis upon strength of schedule gives an unfair advantage to teams from major conferences. Teams from &quot;majors&quot; are allowed to pick many of their non-conference opponents (often blatantly weaker teams). Teams from minor conferences, however, may only get one or two such opponents in their schedules. Also, some mid-major conferences regularly compel their member teams to schedule opponents ranked in the top half of the RPI, which could boost the strength of that conference and/or its tougher-scheduling teams. In basketball, the Missouri Valley Conference has successfully done this: It has become one of the top-rated RPI conferences, despite having very few of its teams ranked in the two national Top 25 polls. In 2006, the NCAA began to release its RPI calculations weekly starting in January. Independent sources, such as ESPN or CNN/SI, also publish their own RPI calculations, which are updated more frequently.

==Basketball formula==
The current and commonly used formula for determining the RPI of a college basketball team at any given time is as follows.

RPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)

where WP is Winning Percentage, OWP is Opponents&#x27; Winning Percentage and OOWP is Opponents&#x27; Opponents&#x27; Winning Percentage.

The WP is calculated by taking a team&#x27;s wins divided by the number of games it has played (i.e. wins plus losses).

For Division 1 NCAA Men&#x27;s basketball, the WP factor of the RPI was updated in 2004 to account for differences in home, away, and neutral games. A home win now counts as 0.6 win, while a road win counts as 1.4 wins. Inversely, a home loss equals 1.4 losses, while a road loss counts as 0.6 loss. A neutral game counts as 1 win or 1 loss. This change was based on statistical data that consistently showed home teams in Division I basketball winning about two-thirds of the time. Note that this location adjustment applies only to the WP factor and not the OWP and OOWP factors. Only games against Division 1 teams are included for all RPI factors. As an example, if a team loses to Syracuse at home, beats them away, and then loses to Cincinnati away, their record would be 1–2. Considering the weighted aspect of the WP, their winning percentage is 1.4 / (1.4 + 1.4 + 0.6) = 0.4118

The OWP is calculated by taking the average of the WP&#x27;s for each of the team&#x27;s opponents with the requirement that all games against the team in question are removed from the equation. Continuing from the example above, assume Syracuse has played one other game and lost, while Cincinnati has played two other teams and won. The team in question has played Syracuse twice and therefore Syracuse must be counted twice. Thus the OWP of the team is (0/1 + 0/1 + 2/2) / 3 (number of opponents – Syracuse, Syracuse, Cincinnati). OWP = 0.3333

The OOWP is calculated by taking the average of each Opponent&#x27;s OWP. Note that the team in question is part of the team&#x27;s OOWP. In fact, the most re-occurring opponent of your opponents is the team in question.

Continuing the example above, a team has played Syracuse twice and Cincinnati once. Syracuse has played one other game and lost, while Cincinnati has played two other games and won. Next, for simplicity, assume none of the unnamed teams has played any other games.

The OOWP is calculated as (Syracuse&#x27;s OWP + Syracuse&#x27;s OWP + Cincinnati&#x27;s OWP ) / 3.

Syracuse has played and beat the team in question (which, excluding the games against Syracuse, only lost to Cincinnati), lost to the team in question (excluding Syracuse, only lost to Cincinnati), and lost one other game (excluding Syracuse, this team has no WP). Syracuse&#x27;s OWP is (0/1 + 0/1) / 2 = 0.0000.

Cincinnati has played the team in question (excluding Cincinnati, they went 1–1 vs. Syracuse) and won versus two other opponents each of which have no WP when games versus Cincinnati are excluded. Cincinnati&#x27;s OWP is (1/2) / 1 = 0.5000.

For the team in question, the OOWP is thus (0.0000 + 0.0000 + 0.5000) / 3 = 0.1667

For the team in question, the RPI can now be calculated:

RPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)

Plugging in numbers from the above example gives you

RPI = (0.4117 * 0.25) + (0.3333 * 0.50) + (0.1667 * 0.25) = 0.3113

===Extended example===
Assume the following game results:

Here is the calculation of the WPs, OWPs, and OOWPs for each team:

WP

:UConn: 3 / 4 = 0.7500 Weighted 2.6/3.2 = 0.8125
:Kansas: 2 / 3 = 0.6667 Weighted 2.0/2.6 = 0.7692
:Duke: 1 / 2 = 0.5000 Weighted 0.6/1.2 = 0.500
:Wisconsin: 0 / 3 = 0.0000 Weighted 0/3.4 = 0.000

OWP

:UConn: ((Kansas 1.0) + (Kansas 1.0) + (Duke 1.0) + (Wisconsin 0.0)) / (4 games) = 0.7500
:Kansas: ((UConn 1.0) + (UConn 1.0) + (Wisconsin 0.0)) / (3 games) = 0.6667
:Duke: ((UConn 0.6667) + (Wisconsin 0.0)) / (2 games) = 0.3333
:Wisconsin: ((UConn 0.6667) + (Duke 0.0) + (Kansas 0.5)) / (3 games) = 0.3889

OOWP

:UConn: ((Kansas 0.6667) + (Kansas 0.6667) + (Duke 0.3333) + (Wisconsin 0.3889)) / (4 games) = 0.5139
:Kansas: ((UConn 0.7500) + (UConn 0.7500) + (Wisconsin 0.3889)) / (3 games) = 0.6296
:Duke: ((UConn 0.7500) + (Wisconsin 0.3889)) / (2 games) = 0.5694
:Wisconsin: ((UConn 0.7500) + (Duke 0.3333) + (Kansas 0.6667)) / (3 games) = 0.5833

These are then combined via the formula
:RPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)
resulting in the following ratings:

:UConn: 0.7066
:Kansas: 0.6830
:Duke: 0.4340
:Wisconsin: 0.3403

The RPI formula also has many flaws. Due to the heavy weighting of opponents winning percentage, beating a team with a bad RPI may actually hurt your RPI. In addition,
losing to a good RPI team can help your RPI. 

===Quadrants===
Since 2018, one criterion for determining selection to the NCAA Tournament has been performance against certain RPI quadrants. Typically, a quadrant 1 win is considered a &quot;good win&quot;, while a quadrant 4 loss is considered a &quot;bad loss&quot;. The quadrants are defined as follows: 

* Quadrant 1: Home games vs. RPI teams ranked in the top 30; neutral games vs. 1-50; away games vs. 1-75.
* Quadrant 2: Home vs. 31-75 teams; neutral vs. 51-100; away vs. 76-135.
* Quadrant 3: Home vs. 76-160 teams; neutral vs. 101-200; away vs. 136-240.
* Quadrant 4: Home vs. 161-plus teams; neutral vs. 201-plus; away vs. 241-plus.

The quadrant system is still in use under the new NET system, with RPI ranking replaced by NET ranking.

===Replacement with NET for Division I basketball===
The NCAA announced on August 22, 2018, that the RPI would no longer be used in the Division I men&#x27;s basketball selection process and would be replaced by the aforementioned NET. This new metric takes the following into account:
* Game results
* Strength of schedule
* Game location (home, away, or neutral court)
* Scoring margin — While included in the NET, teams receive no extra credit for wins by more than 10 points. Additionally, overtime games are assigned a 1-point victory margin, regardless of the actual score.
* Net offensive and defensive efficiency
* Quality of wins and losses, using the existing quadrant system
Game date and order are not included in the NET—all games are treated equally, whether an early-season matchup or a conference tournament championship game.

==Baseball formula==
The formula used in NCAA baseball is the same as that used in basketball except for the adjustment of home and road records. Starting in 2013, college baseball RPI formula values each road victory as 1.3 instead of 1.0. Each home win is valued at 0.7 instead of 1.0. Conversely, each home loss counts 1.3 against a team’s RPI and each road loss counts 0.7 against a team’s RPI. Neutral-site games have a value of 1.0, but the committee is studying how to determine if a game should be considered a neutral-site contest. The adjustment is based on data showing that home teams win about 62 percent of the time in Division I baseball.&quot; The change was made because of the discrepancy in the number of home games teams play. Some schools are able to play 35–40 of their 56 allowable games at home, while other teams, due to factors such as weather, may play only 20 home games.

This adjustment replaces the previous system of bonuses or penalties that teams received. Bonus points were awarded for beating top-75 non-conference opponents on the road and penalty points were given for losing to bottom-75 non-conference opponents at home. Bonuses and penalties were on a sliding scale, separated into groups of 25, with the top bonus for a road win against a top-25 team and the worst penalty for a home loss to a bottom-25 opponent.

<doc id="529981" wikidata="Q142943" url="?curid=529981" title="Membrane transport protein">
<text>A membrane transport protein is a membrane protein involved in the movement of ions, small molecules, and macromolecules, such as another protein, across a biological membrane. Transport proteins are integral transmembrane proteins; that is they exist permanently within and span the membrane across which they transport substances. The proteins may assist in the movement of substances by facilitated diffusion, active transport, osmosis, or reverse diffusion. The two main types of proteins involved in such transport are broadly categorized as either channels or carriers (a.k.a. transporters, or permeases). Examples of channel/carrier proteins include the GLUT 1 uniporter, sodium channels, and potassium channels. The solute carriers and atypical SLCs are secondary active or facilitative transporters in humans. Collectively membrane transporters and channels are known as the transportome. Transportomes govern cellular influx and efflux of not only ions and nutrients but drugs as well.

==Difference between channels and carriers==
A carrier is not open simultaneously to both the extracellular and intracellular environments. Either its inner gate is open, or outer gate is open. In contrast, a channel can be open to both environments at the same time, allowing the molecules to diffuse without interruption. Carriers have binding sites, but pores and channels do not. When a channel is opened, millions of ions can pass through the membrane per second, but only 100 to 1000 molecules typically pass through a carrier molecule in the same time. Each carrier protein is designed to recognize only one substance or one group of very similar substances. Research has correlated defects in specific carrier proteins with specific diseases.

==Active transport==

 Active transport is the movement of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient. This is usually to accumulate high concentrations of molecules that a cell needs, such as glucose or amino acids. If the process uses chemical energy, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is called primary active transport. Membrane transport proteins that are driven directly by the hydrolysis of ATP are referred to as ATPase pumps. These types of pumps directly the exergonic hydrolysis of ATP to the unfavorable movement of molecules against their concentration gradient. Examples of ATPase pumps include P-type ATPase&#x27;s, V-type ATPases, F-type ATPases, and ABC binding cassettes.

Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient, and does not use energy produced in the cell. Secondary active transport commonly uses types of carrier proteins, typically symporters and antiporters. Symporter proteins couple the transport of one molecule down its concentration gradient to the transport of another molecule against its concentration gradient, and both molecules diffuse in the same direction. Antiporter proteins transport one molecule down its concentration gradient to transport another molecule against its concentration gradient, but the molecules diffuse in opposite directions. As symporters and antiporters are involved in coupling the transport of two molecules, they are commonly referred to as cotransporters. Unlike channel proteins which only transport substances through membranes passively, carrier proteins can transport ions and molecules either passively through facilitated diffusion, or via secondary active transport. A carrier protein is required to move particles from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration. These carrier proteins have receptors that bind to a specific molecule (substrate) needing transport. The molecule or ion to be transported (the substrate) must first bind at a binding site at the carrier molecule, with a certain binding affinity. Following binding, and while the binding site is facing the same way, the carrier will capture or occlude (take in and retain) the substrate within its molecular structure and cause an internal translocation so that the opening in the protein now faces the other side of the plasma membrane. The carrier protein substrate is released at that site, according to its binding affinity there.

==Facilitated diffusion==
Facilitated diffusion is the passage of molecules or ions across a biological membrane through specific transport proteins and requires no energy input. Facilitated diffusion is used especially in the case of large polar molecules and charged ions; once such ions are dissolved in water they cannot diffuse freely across cell membranes due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids that make up the bilayers.
The type of carrier proteins used in facilitated diffusion is slightly different from those used in active transport. They are still transmembrane carrier proteins, but these are gated transmembrane channels, meaning they do not internally translocate, nor require ATP to function. The substrate is taken in one side of the gated carrier, and without using ATP the substrate is released into the cell. Facilitated diffusion does not require the use of ATP as facilitated diffusion, like simple diffusion, transports molecules or ions along their concentration gradient.

== Osmosis ==

Osmosis is the passive diffusion of water across a cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Since Osmosis is a passive process, like facilitated diffusion and simple diffusion, it does not require the use of ATP. Osmosis is important in regulating the balance of water and salt within cells, thus it plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis. Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins that allow for the rapid passage of water and glycerol through membranes. The aquaporin monomers consist of six transmembrane alpha-helix domains and these monomers can assemble to form the aquaporin proteins. As four of these monomers come together to form the aquaporin protein, it is known as a homotetramer, meaning it is made up of four identical subunits. All aquaporins are tetrameric membrane integral proteins, and the water passes through each individual monomer channel rather than between all of the four channels. Since aquaporins are transmembrane channels for the diffusion of water, the channels that make up the aquaporin are typically lined with hydrophilic side chains to allow water to pass through.

==Reverse diffusion==

Reverse transport, or &quot;transporter reversal&quot;, is a phenomenon in which the substrates of a membrane transport protein are moved in the opposite direction to that of their typical movement by the transporter. Transporter reversal typically occurs when a membrane transport protein is phosphorylated by a particular protein kinase, which is an enzyme that adds a phosphate group to proteins.

==Types==

(Grouped by Transporter Classification database categories)

===1: Channels/pores===
* α-helical protein channels such as voltage-gated ion channel (VIC), ligand-gated ion channels(LGICs)
* β-barrel porins such as aquaporin
* channel-forming toxins, including colicins, diphtheria toxin, and others
* Nonribosomally synthesized channels such as gramicidin
* Holins; which function in export of enzymes that digest bacterial cell walls in an early step of cell lysis.

Facilitated diffusion occurs in and out of the cell membrane via channels/pores and carriers/porters.

Note:
* Channels:
Channels are either in open state or closed state. When a channel is opened with a slight conformational switch, it is open to both environment simultaneously (extracellular and intracellular)
* Pores:
Pores are continuously open to these both environment, because they do not undergo conformational changes. They are always open and active.

===2: Electrochemical potential-driven transporters===
Also named carrier proteins or secondary carriers.
* 2.A: Porters (uniporters, symporters, antiporters), SLCs.
** Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs)
*** EAAT1
*** EAAT2
*** EAAT3
*** EAAT4
*** EAAT5
** Glucose transporter
** Monoamine transporters, including:
*** Dopamine transporter (DAT)
*** Norepinephrine transporter (NET)
*** Serotonin transporter (SERT)
*** Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT)
** Adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT)
* 2.B: Nonribosomally synthesized porters, such as:
** The Nigericin family
** The Ionomycin family
* 2.C: Ion-gradient-driven energizers

===3: Primary Active Transporters===
* 3.A: P-P-bond-hydrolysis-driven transporters (a.k.a. ATP-driven pumps, or transport ATPases):
** ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), such as MDR, CFTR
** V-type ATPase ; ( &quot;V&quot; related to vacuolar ).
** P-type ATPase ; ( &quot;P&quot; related to phosphorylation), such as:
*** Na+/K+-ATPase
*** Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase
*** Proton pump
** F-type ATPase; (&quot;F&quot; related to factor), including: mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase1
* 3.B: Decarboxylation-driven transporters
* 3.C: Methyltransfer-driven transporters
* 3.D: Oxidoreduction-driven transporters
* 3.E: Light absorption-driven transporters, such as rhodopsin

=== 4: Group translocators ===
The group translocators provide a special mechanism for the phosphorylation of sugars as they are transported into bacteria (PEP group translocation)

===5: Electron carriers===
The transmembrane electron transfer carriers in the membrane include two-electron carriers, such as the disulfide bond oxidoreductases (DsbB and DsbD in E. coli) as well as one-electron carriers such as NADPH oxidase. Often these redox proteins are not considered transport proteins.

==Relevant Examples==

=== GLUT 1 ===
Every carrier protein, especially within the same cell membrane, is specific to one type or family of molecules. GLUT1 is a named carrier protein found in almost all animal cell membranes that transports glucose across the bilayer. This protein is a uniporter, meaning it transports glucose along its concentration in a singular direction. It is an integral membrane protein carrier with a hydrophilic interior, which allows it to bind to glucose. As GLUT 1 is a type of carrier protein, it will undergo a conformational change to allow glucose to enter the other side of the plasma membrane. GLUT 1 is commonly found in the red blood cell membranes of mammals.
=== Sodium/Potassium Channels ===
While there are many examples of channels within the human body, two notable ones are sodium and potassium channels. Potassium channels are typically involved in the transport of potassium ions across the cell membrane to the outside of the cell, which helps maintain the negative membrane potential of cells. As there are more potassium channels than sodium channels, more potassium flows out of the cell than sodium into a cell, thus why the membrane potential is negative. Sodium channels are typically involved in the transport of sodium ions across the cell membrane into the cell. These channels are commonly associated with excitable neurons, as an influx of sodium can trigger depolarization, which in turn propagates an action potential. As these proteins are types of channel proteins, they do not undergo a change of conformation after binding their respective substrates.
=== Other Examples ===
Other specific carrier proteins also help the body function in important ways. Cytochromes operate in the electron transport chain as carrier proteins for electrons.

==Pathology==
A number of inherited diseases involve defects in carrier proteins in a particular substance or group of cells. Cysteinuria (cysteine in the urine and the bladder) is such a disease involving defective cysteine carrier proteins in the kidney cell membranes. This transport system normally removes cysteine from the fluid destined to become urine and returns this essential amino acid to the blood. When this carrier malfunctions, large quantities of cysteine remain in the urine, where it is relatively insoluble and tends to precipitate. This is one cause of urinary stones. Some vitamin carrier proteins have been shown to be overexpressed in patients with malignant disease. For example, levels of riboflavin carrier protein (RCP) have been shown to be significantly elevated in people with breast cancer.

<text>Youree Dell Harris (August 12, 1962 – July 26, 2016) was an American television personality and actress best known for portraying Miss Cleo, a spokeswoman for a psychic pay-per-call-minute service called Psychic Readers Network, in a series of television commercials that aired from 1997 to 2003. Harris used various aliases, including Ree Perris, Youree Cleomili, Youree Dell Harris, Youree Perris, Rae Dell Harris, Cleomili Perris Youree, and Cleomili Harris.&lt;ref name=&quot;seattlepi/miss-cleo-deception&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Youree Harris was born on August 12, 1962,&lt;ref name=&quot;californiabirthindex/8028366&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at Los Angeles County Hospital to Alisa Teresa Hopis and David Harris. She attended, as a boarder, Ramona Convent Secondary School, a Catholic girls&#x27; school in Alhambra, California. 

The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;″s Dorothy Parvaz reported that University of Southern California found no records that Harris had enrolled for four classes in 1980, as reported by &quot;People&quot; magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo/171959485&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Seattle===
In 1996, Harris as &quot;Ree Perris&quot;, wrote a play entitled &quot;For Women Only&quot;, playing a Jamaican woman named &quot;Cleo&quot;, in Seattle.

In 1997, Harris as &quot;Ree Perris&quot;, produced and performed two plays with the Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center in Seattle, &quot;Summer Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Supper Club Cafe&quot;.

Her last project, &quot;Supper Club Cafe&quot; in 1997, was not successful, and she &quot;left town with a trail of debts and broken promises&quot;, according to the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;. Some of the cast of her productions claimed that they were never paid, and that Harris &quot;told her cast members she had bone cancer&quot; and &quot;her medical costs would prevent her from paying people immediately&quot;, but she wrote each actor and crew member a letter telling him or her how much money she owed them.

===Psychic Readers Network===
In January 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;browardpalmbeach/6323143&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Feder and Peter Stolz (sometimes spelled: Stotz&lt;ref name=&quot;browardpalmbeach/miss-cleo-dead&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stoltz Stolz&lt;ref name=&quot;sun-sentinel/0210030079&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) started &quot;Psychic Advisors Network&quot;, launched to compete with Psychic Friends Network using Philip Michael Thomas, Billy Dee Williams and Catherine Oxenberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;courttv/misscleo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Harris moved to Florida, met Steven Feder and Peter Stolz, Fort Lauderdale cousins behind Access Resource Services, doing business as Psychic Readers Network and took a call-taker job as reader No. 16153.&lt;ref name=&quot;spokesman/miss-cleo-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/lives-lived-miss-cleo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was using the Jamaican accent when she moved to Florida and began working as a tarot-reading psychic for a telemarketing center.&lt;ref name=&quot;people/0,20139413,00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was approached by Access Resource Services while working at an event in a Pompano Beach, Florida, mall and agreed to appear in an ad in 2000.

&quot;the whole point was two things: keeping people on the phone as long as possible...and...telling people what they wanted to hear&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;xojane/psychic-for-miss-cleo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the late 1990s, Harris began work for the Psychic Readers Network under the name Cleo. She appeared as a television infomercial psychic in which she claimed to be a shaman from Jamaica. Her employers&#x27; website also stated that Harris had been born in Trelawny, Jamaica, and grown up there.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/miss-cleo-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The network used the title &quot;Miss Cleo&quot; and sent unsolicited emails, some of which stated, &quot;[Miss Cleo has] been authorized to issue you a Special Tarot Reading!... it is vital that you call immediately!&quot; Charges of deceptive advertising and of fraud on the part of the network began to surface around this time. Among the complaints were allegations that calls to Miss Cleo were answered by her &quot;associates&quot; who were actors reading from scripts, and that calls promoted as &quot;free&quot; were in fact charged for.

A tie-in book, &quot;Keepin&#x27; It Real: A Practical Guide for Spiritual Living&quot; appeared in 2001. Its authorship was attributed to Miss Cleo.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/miss-cleo-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Access Resource Services, doing business as Psychic Readers Network, was sued in various lawsuits originating in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,&lt;ref name=&quot;ljworld/2001/kansas-investigating-psychic-hotline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri,&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/14351033665445&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/2001-07-25/lawsuit-miss-cleo-pay-per-call&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and elsewhere, as well as the Federal Communications Commission,&lt;ref name=&quot;ftc.gov/access-resource-services&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission charged the company&#x27;s owners and Harris&#x27; promoters, Steven Feder and Peter Stolz, with deceptive advertising, billing, and collection practices; Harris was not indicted. The network had billed its victims for an estimated $1 billion. Her promoters agreed to settle by paying a $5 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission, as well a combined debt forgiveness and refund checks to callers which came to a monumental $500 million. It emerged during a lawsuit in Florida that Harris had been born in Los Angeles, and that her parents were American citizens.

The state of Florida also sued Harris under a provision of the law that allowed spokespeople to be held liable. Dave Aronberg of the Florida Attorney General’s Office led the state’s case against her. His successor dropped the charges.

===After Psychic Readers Network===
On 11 July 2001, Harris started a company, Waghwaan Entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;browardpalmbeach/6322600&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris voiced the character of Auntie Poulet in the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;sun-sentinel/cereal-lawsuit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that TV music network Fuse had signed Harris as a spokeswoman. In early 2005, Harris was reportedly appearing on television as Miss Cleo in advertisements for a used car dealership in Florida, according to the &quot;Broward-Palm Beach New Times&quot;.

Harris offered &quot;readings&quot;, priced from $75 to $250, and &quot;weddings&quot;, priced from $350 and up.&lt;ref name=&quot;the-real-mscleo/services&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harris had a podcast. 

In September 2007, Harris released a spoken-word CD, &quot;Convicted for My Beliefs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;browardpalmbeach/6310671&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the name Cleomili Harris she spoke, from Toronto, about her experiences at the Psychic Readers Network in the 2014 documentary &quot;Hotline,&quot; which focuses on the history of telephone hotlines.&lt;ref name=&quot;vice/ms-cleo-Hotline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychic Readers Network&#x27;s &quot;Miss Cleo&quot; lawsuits==
In 2015, as Miss Cleo, Harris appeared in a series of advertisements for the General Mills breakfast cereal French Toast Crunch. The Psychic Readers Network sued on the basis that they owned the character of Miss Cleo. The advertisements were discontinued.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/miss-cleo-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Psychic Readers Network sued Benefit Cosmetics, a Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey subsidiary, for using Harris as &quot;Miss Cleo&quot; in a makeup commercial, as the persona″s owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;allisonlegal/6129-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailybusinessreview/1202769518327&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usmagazine/miss-cleo-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Harris married at age 19, gave birth to a daughter, and divorced at age 21. She had a second daughter while in her late 20s. In 2006, she came out as a lesbian.

Harris developed colorectal cancer, which metastasized. She died under hospice care in Palm Beach, Florida, on July 26, 2016, at the age of 53.

In December 2022, HBO Max released a feature documentary about Harris&#x27; life titled &quot;Call Me Miss Cleo&quot;.

On August 10, 2024, Lifetime Movie Network released a Movie of the Week titled, &quot;Miss Cleo: Her Rise and Fall&quot;. The movie is a Hillionaire Productions film, and the executive producer is Jami McCoy Lankford.

<doc id="529995" wikidata="Q982231" url="?curid=529995" title="Nick Mallett">
<text>Nicholas Vivian Haward Mallett (born 30 October 1956) is a former South African rugby union player who played for the Springboks, South Africa&#x27;s national rugby union team, in 1984. He also coached the Springboks between 1997 and 2000 and was the head coach of Italy&#x27;s rugby union team between 2007 and 2011.

==Early life==

Born on 30 October 1956 in Hertford Heath, England, Mallett moved to Rhodesia with his family in 1956 when he was only six weeks old, and his father, Tony Mallett, took up a post as an English teacher at the recently founded Peterhouse Boys&#x27; School, in Marandellas near Salisbury. Nick first arrived in Cape Town, South Africa in 1963, when his father was appointed Headmaster of Diocesan College, after which he attended St. Andrew&#x27;s College, Grahamstown. He graduated from the University of Cape Town in 1977 with a BA in English and History. While a student at the university, he was selected to play for the Western Province rugby union team.

==Playing career==

In 1979 Mallett moved back to England to attend University College at the University of Oxford, where he not only gained further qualifications but also won Blues in rugby union and cricket, famously hitting three sixes in one over off Ian Botham. Eventually he returned to South Africa, where he represented Western Province in four consecutive Currie Cup wins between 1982 and 1985, and played two games for the Springboks in 1984 against the South American Jaguars.

=== Test history ===
==Coaching career==

===The beginning===

Mallett once again left South Africa in 1985, this time for France, where he played and coached rugby for seven years until 1992 before eventually returning to South Africa in 1994 and taking a job as Head of the False Bay Rugby Club until 1995.

Between 1995 and 1996, Mallett took up the role of head coach of the Boland Cavaliers before being appointed assistant coach to the Springboks in 1996 and finally getting the job of Springbok Coach in 1997.

===Coach of Springboks (1997–2000)===

Between August 1997 and December 1998, under Mallett&#x27;s guidance, the Springboks went on a record winning streak of 17 consecutive test wins. As part of the unbeaten run the Springboks won the Tri Nations Series undefeated and beat several teams by record margins, including a 52–10 against France in Paris, a 68–10 win over Scotland in Edinburgh, a 33–0 defeat of Ireland and a 96–13 against Wales. The run ended when the Springbok team was defeated by England at Twickenham at the end of a long tour on 5 December 1998.

The relationship between Mallet and Gary Teichmann, one of South Africa&#x27;s most successful team captains ever (with 36 wins), began to sour and Teichman was controversially excluded from the 1999 Rugby World Cup squad. Mallet looked for a new captain, first turning to Corné Krige then Rassie Erasmus, Joost van der Westhuizen and André Vos for a solution. In the end, despite the internal instability in the squad, the Springboks managed four consecutive wins and were finally knocked out of the championship in the semi-final by eventual winners Australia. Despite his team&#x27;s relatively mediocre results of 8 wins and 5 losses in 1999, the Springboks still managed to break more records, beating Italy 101–0 and England in the quarter-final 44–21, with Jannie de Beer kicking a world-record five drop goals in that game.

In 2000, Mallett accused the South Africa Rugby Football Union (SARFU) of &quot;greed&quot; for selling Tri-Nations championship tickets at inflated prices. He had alienated the SARFU executive, and on 27 September he resigned as national coach at the start of a disciplinary hearing began into allegations that his comments had brought the game into disrepute. Some fans, upset by how he had treated Teichman and his team&#x27;s sudden poor performance, were also keen to see him go.

In spite of his team&#x27;s relatively poor performance and the internal strife that marred his final years as coach, Mallett remains one of South Africa&#x27;s most successful coaches ever, having won 27 of the 38 tests played under his guidance and rewriting the record books several times

===Stade Français (2002–04)===

Mallett moved back to France as coach for the Paris club Stade Français, which he led to two consecutive French domestic title wins in 2003 and 2004 before returning to South Africa where he accepted the job of Director of Rugby at Western Province. Initially there was speculation that he might coach the Springbok team again, but those rumours were quashed by the appointment of Jake White as the new South African coach.

Mallet was linked with the position of England coach after the coerced resignation of Andy Robinson in 2006, a position that eventually went to Brian Ashton. In 2007 Mallett became coach of Italy.

===Italy (2007–11)===

On 3 October 2007, Mallett replaced Frenchman Pierre Berbizier as &quot;CT&quot; (&quot;Technical Commissioner&quot;, i.e. coach) of the Italy national rugby union team. His Six Nations debut was fairly impressive; Italy were defeated by Ireland 11–16 in the first game, but came close to victory against Jonny Wilkinson&#x27;s England team. Italy lost also against Wales and France. In those matches he gave Andrea Marcato and Alberto Sgarbi their debuts&#x27;. In the final game, Mallett&#x27;s team beat Scotland 23–20, thanks to Marcato&#x27;s late drop goal. However, Italy won the wooden spoon because their points difference was worse than Scotland&#x27;s.

During the summer test matches, he got a good result against South Africa, the world champions at the time, in Cape Town, despite Italy losing 0–26. In Córdoba Italy beat Argentina for the first time thanks to Leonardo Ghiraldini&#x27;s try and a late penalty by Marcato.

He also coached the Barbarians against the All Blacks in December 2009 with the &#x27;Baa-Baas&#x27; winning 25–18.
In 2010 Mallet coached the Barbarians to victory over South Africa.

In the 2010 Six Nations, Mallett guided Italy to a 16–12 win against Scotland. Despite this victory, Italy&#x27;s only win in the competition, Italy still finished last because Scotland&#x27;s points difference was just one better.
In the 2011 Six Nations Championship Italy beat France by 22–21 in arguably their best victory to date.

===Retirement (2011–present)===

In November 2011, after the World Cup in New Zealand, Nick Mallett&#x27;s contract as head coach of Italy expired and he returned to Cape Town with Frenchman Jacques Brunel taking over the Italy job. Mallett has stated that he wishes to spend time with his family in South Africa, despite being briefly linked to the position as Coach of England following Martin Johnson&#x27;s resignation.

<doc id="529998" wikidata="Q663053" url="?curid=529998" title="Omni (magazine)">
<text>Omni was a science and science fiction magazine published for domestic American and UK markets. It contained articles on science, parapsychology, and short works of science fiction and fantasy. It was published as a print version between October 1978 and 1995. The first &quot;Omni&quot; e-magazine was published on CompuServe in 1986 and the magazine switched to a purely online presence in 1996. It ceased publication abruptly in late 1997, following the death of co-founder Kathy Keeton; activity on the magazine&#x27;s website ended the following April.

==History==
===Concept===
&quot;Omni&quot; was founded by Kathy Keeton and her long-time collaborator and future husband Bob Guccione, the publisher of &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine. The initial concept came from Keeton, who wanted a magazine &quot;that explored all realms of science and the paranormal, that delved into all corners of the unknown and projected some of those discoveries into fiction&quot;.

Dick Teresi, an author and former &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; editor, wrote the proposal for the magazine, from which a dummy was produced. In pre-launch publicity it was referred to as &quot;Nova&quot; but the name was changed before the first issue went to print to avoid a conflict with the PBS science show of the same name. Guccione described the magazine as &quot;an original if not controversial mixture of science fact, fiction, fantasy and the paranormal&quot;. The debut edition had an exclusive interview with Freeman Dyson, a renowned physicist, and the second edition carried an interview with Alvin Toffler, futurist and author of &quot;Future Shock&quot;.

===Fiction===
In its early run, &quot;Omni&quot; published a number of stories that have become genre classics, such as Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Unaccompanied Sonata&quot;, William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; and &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, and George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;Sandkings&quot;. The magazine also published original science fiction and fantasy by William S. Burroughs, Joyce Carol Oates, Jonathan Carroll, Julio Cortázar, T. Coraghessan Boyle, and other mainstream writers. The magazine excerpted Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Firestarter&quot;, and featured his short story &quot;The End of the Whole Mess&quot;. &quot;Omni&quot; also brought the works of numerous painters to the attention of a large audience, such as H. R. Giger, De Es Schwertberger and Rallé. In the early 1980s, popular fiction stories from &quot;Omni&quot; were reprinted in &quot;The Best of Omni Science Fiction&quot; series and featured art by space artists like Robert McCall.
A fictional cover of the magazine appears in the 1984 &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; movie, featuring a photo of the proton pack on the cover.

===Market===
&quot;Omni&quot; entered the market at the start of a wave of new science magazines aimed at educated but otherwise &quot;non-professional&quot; readers. &quot;Science Digest&quot; and &quot;Science News&quot; already served the high-school market, and &quot;Scientific American&quot; and &quot;New Scientist&quot; the professional, while &quot;Omni&quot; was arguably the first aimed at &quot;armchair scientists&quot; who were nevertheless well informed about technical issues. The next year, however, &quot;Time&quot; introduced &quot;Discover&quot; while the AAAS introduced &quot;Science &#x27;80&quot;. Advertising dollars were spread among the different magazines, and those without deep pockets soon folded in the 1980s, notably &quot;Science Digest&quot;, while &quot;Science &#x27;80&quot; merged with &quot;Discover&quot;. &quot;Omni&quot; appeared to weather this storm better than most, likely due to its wider selection of contents. In early 1996 publisher Bob Guccione suspended publication of the print edition of &quot;Omni&quot;, attributing the decision to the rising price of paper and postage. At the end of its print run the circulation was still reported to be more than 700,000 copies a month.

In September 1997, Keeton died of complications from surgery for an intestinal obstruction. The staff of &quot;Omni Internet&quot; was laid off, and no new content was added to the website after April 1998. General Media shut the site down and removed the &quot;Omni&quot; archives from the Internet in 2003.

==Editions==
===International editions===
&quot;Omni&quot; magazine was published in at least six languages. The content in the British editions closely followed the North American editions, but with a different numbering sequence. This was mainly accomplished by wrapping the American edition in a new cover which featured British advertising on the inside. At least one British edition was entirely unique and was shipped under the banner of &quot;Omni UK&quot;. An Italian edition was edited by Alberto Peruzzo and ran for 20 issues from 1981 to 1983, when Peruzzo detached the name Omni from his local edition. The Italian spin-off continued with the name &quot;Futura&quot;, while maintaining the same graphical style and with an unchanged intended audience, for another twenty issues, up to July 1985. The Japanese edition ran from 1982 to the summer of 1989 and included almost entirely different content from the American edition. The German edition began in 1984 and ended in early 1986. The first Spanish edition appeared in November 1986 and ran until the summer of 1988. A Russian edition was published in the Soviet Union beginning in September 1989 in conjunction with the USSR Academy of Sciences. These editions were 80% in English and featured both Russian and English advertising. Publisher Guccione arranged for 20,000 copies of the Russian edition to be placed on news stands and onboard internal Aeroflot flights in the Soviet Union in exchange for an equivalent number of copies of &quot;Science in Russia&quot; being distributed in the USA. &quot;Omni&quot; ran subscription adverts beginning in August 1989 for &quot;Science in Russia&quot;. This arrangement was intended to last for one year and was made possible by the Glasnost events in the Soviet Union.

===Webzine===
&quot;Omni&quot; first began its online presence as part of Compuserve in the summer of 1986. On September 5, 1993, &quot;Omni&quot; became part of the America Online service. The AOL unveiling took place at the 51st World Science Fiction Convention in San Francisco. AOL subscribers had access to much of the &quot;Omni&quot; printed archive as well as forums, chat groups and new fiction. After the print magazine folded, the &quot;Omni Internet&quot; webzine was launched on September 15, 1996. For the first few months the new website was integrated into the AOL service, replacing the existing AOL Omni interface. Now free of pressure to focus on fringe science areas, &quot;Omni&quot; returned to its roots as the home of gonzo science writing, becoming one of the first large-scale venues to deliver a journalism geared specifically to cyberspace, complete with real-time coverage of major science events, chats and blogs with scientific luminaries, and interactive experiments that users could join. The world&#x27;s top science fiction writers also joined in, writing collaborative fiction pieces for &quot;Omni&quot;&#x27;s readers live online.

===Television===
A short-lived syndicated television show based on the magazine&#x27;s format (and called &quot;Omni: The New Frontier&quot;) aired in the United States beginning in September 1981, hosted by Peter Ustinov. A French-language, dubbed version of the show appeared on the Canadian public TV network Radio-Québec (now known as Télé-Québec) in 1994. In 1985, extracts of the 1981 television series were re-edited and repackaged into four television shows hosted by Keir Dullea under the title &quot;Omni: Visions of the Future&quot;. Episodes were titled &quot;Futurebody&quot;, &quot;Space&quot;, &quot;Amazing Medicine&quot; and &quot;Lifestyles in the 21st Century&quot;.

===Comics===
An equally short-lived spin-off magazine called &quot;Omni Comix&quot; debuted in 1995, and was published in the same glossy, newsstand magazine format as its sister publications &quot;Omni&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Penthouse Comix&quot;. &quot;Omni Comix&quot; ran for only three issues, and the third and final issue featured an abortive revival of the 1960s superhero series &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;.

=== Anthologies ===
From 1983 to 1986, Zebra Books published a series of anthologies containing selected non-fiction content from &quot;Omni&quot; magazine:

* &quot;The Omni Book of Space&quot; edited by Owen Davies (, published in October 1983)

From 1984 to 1989, Zebra Books also published a series of Science Fiction anthologies containing stories published in &quot;Omni&quot; magazine with all volumes edited by Ellen Datlow who was also serving as the editor of &quot;Omni&quot; magazine at the time:
* &quot;The First Omni Book of Science Fiction&quot; (, published in January 1984)

* &quot;The Sixth Omni Book of Science Fiction&quot; (, published in March 1989)
* &quot;The Seventh Omni Book of Science Fiction&quot; (, published in June 1989)

Ellen Datlow also edited and released the following Science Fiction anthologies of stories published in &quot;Omni&quot; magazine under the &quot;OMNI Books&quot; imprint:
* &quot;Omni Best Science Fiction One&quot; (, published in October 1992)
* &quot;Omni Best Science Fiction Two&quot; (, published in November 1992)
* &quot;Omni Best Science Fiction Three&quot; (, published in June 1993)
* &quot;Omni Visions One&quot; (, published in November 1993)
* &quot;Omni Visions Two&quot; (, published in July 1994)

Pharos books also published &quot;The Omni Future Almanac&quot; edited by Robert Weil.
* &quot;The Omni Future Almanac&quot; (, published in December 1983)

==Editorial staff==

The magazine was initially edited by Frank Kendig, who left several months after the magazine&#x27;s launch. Ben Bova, who was hired as fiction editor, was promoted to editor. Bova then left the magazine in 1981. Subsequent editors included Dick Teresi, Gurney Williams III, Patrice Adcroft, Keith Ferrell, and Pamela Weintraub (editor of &quot;Omni&quot; as one of the first major standalone webzines from 1996 to 1998). Kathleen Stein managed the magazine&#x27;s prestigious Q&amp;A interviews with the top scientists of the 20th century through 1998. Ellen Datlow was associate fiction editor of &quot;Omni&quot; under Robert Sheckley for one and a half years, and took over as fiction editor in 1981 until the magazine was suspended in 1998. In 2016, two print issues of OMNI were published by members of the original staff, including Weintraub and Datlow. Under the umbrella of PGMI, OMNI was reimagined as a series of print quarterlies starting in 2017, with Pamela Weintraub as editor-in-chief and Ellen Datlow as fiction editor. Other team members include Robert Killheffer and Corey S. Powell as executive editors and Matt Westphalen as creative director.

==Ownership==
In 2013, Glenn Fleishman undertook a research project with the goal of learning who currently owns the &quot;Omni&quot; intellectual property, and concluded that the rights to the fiction published in &quot;Omni&quot; had long since reverted to the original authors (who had only sold first North American publication rights), and that &quot;possibly even the current ostensible owner&quot; may not know who owns the rights to the rest of the content.

===Reboot===
In August 2013, plans to launch &quot;a new online project&quot;, described as an &quot;&quot;Omni&quot; reboot&quot;, were reported by &quot;The Verge&quot;. The project was said to be under the guidance of producer Rick Schwartz and businessman/collector Jeremy Frommer, who purchased a storage locker &quot;on a whim&quot; in November 2012 that was found to contain &quot;a sizable chunk of the estate of Bob Guccione&quot;. The rediscovered materials include &quot;cover drafts with greasy pencil notations, thousands of 35-mm slides, large-format chromes, magazines bundled with stapled paperwork, production materials, and untold amounts of photos and artwork.&quot;

===Penthouse publishes new &quot;Omni&quot;===
Penthouse Global Media acquired &quot;Omni&quot; in 2017, and announced plans for a new print issue, to commence publication on 24 October. The issue was published and billed as the Winter 2017 issue, the first on a quarterly schedule, but no further issues were ever published.

<text>Bruce County is a county in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It has eight lower-tier municipalities with a total 2016 population of 66,491. It is named for James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin and 12th Earl of Kincardine, the sixth Governor General of the Province of Canada. The Bruce name is also linked to the Bruce Trail and the Bruce Peninsula.

The county has three distinct areas. The Bruce Peninsula is part of the Niagara Escarpment and is known for its views, rock formations, cliffs, and hiking trails. The Lakeshore includes nearly 100 km of fresh water and soft sandy beaches. Finally, the Interior Region has a strong history in farming.

==History==
===Cessions of First Nations lands===
The territory of the County arose from various surrenders of First Nations lands.

The bulk of the land arose from the Queen&#x27;s Bush, as a result of the 1836 Saugeen Tract Agreement. That was followed by the cession of the Indian Strip in 1851 for a road between Owen Sound and Southampton that was never constructed. Friction between the Chippewas arising out of that led to significant delay in later negotiations.

The Saugeen Surrenders of 1854, known as &quot;Treaty 72,&quot; transferred the remainder of the Bruce Peninsula to the Crown and reserved the following lands:

===Municipal history===

Huron County was organized in the Huron District in 1845, and the District itself, which had been continued for judicial purposes, was abolished in early 1850. Legislation passed later in the same session of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada provided instead for it to be reconstituted as the United Counties of Huron, Perth and Bruce, with the territory of the Bruce Peninsula (referred to as the &quot;Indian Reserve&quot;) to ne withdrawn and annexed to Waterloo County. Bruce County consisted of the following townships:
* Huron
* Kinloss
* Curloss
* Carrick
* Kincardine
* Greenock
* Brant
* Bruce
* Saugeen
* Elderslie
* Arran
The Indian Reserve (being the part not otherwise transferred to Grey County) was later withdrawn from Waterloo and transferred to Bruce in 1851. The County of Perth was given its own Provisional Municipal Council at that time, and was separated from the United Counties in 1853.

In 1849, the Huron District Council initially united the area of the county with the United Townships of Wawanosh and Ashfield as a single municipality, which lasted until 1851, when Wawanosh and Ashfield were withdrawn. The area then became known as the &quot;United Townships in the County of Bruce,&quot; which lasted until its division into municipalities in 1854.

The Bruce Peninsula was later surveyed into townships, starting with Amabel and Albemarle in 1855, Eastnor in 1862, followed by Lindsay in 1870 and St. Edmunds in 1871.

The following villages and towns would be constituted over the years:

===Formation of separate county council (18571867)===

A Provisional Municipal Council was established for Bruce County at the beginning of 1857, Walkerton was initially proclaimed as the county seat, in preference to Kincardine, but local opposition forced the proclamation to be deferred until each town and village had presented a case for its selection. A subsequent proclamation confirmed Walkerton&#x27;s selection.

In 1863, the provisional council promoted a bill in the Legislative Assembly to divide the county into the counties of Bruce and Wallace, with Kincardine and Southampton once more proposed as the respective county towns, but it went only as far as thé second reading and did not proceed further.

The provisional council later asked for legislation to provide for a referendum as to whether Walkerton, Paisley, Kincardine, or another place would be the most acceptable choice. The referendum was held in September 1864, and Paisley received a plurality of the votes. In early 1865, the provisional council asked for legislation to confirm the result but changed its mind later in the year in favour of Walkerton. Confirming legislation was passed in 1866 to provide for the dissolution of the United Counties on January 1, 1867, with Huron and Bruce becoming separate counties for all purposes.

==Indigenous lands==
Two First Nations are included within the Bruce census division, but their lands are separate from the county administration:

===Land disputes===
There have been disputes relating to cottage owners leasing properties on First Nations lands in the county. At Hope Bay, the occupiers of 68 cottages saw their leases revoked in 2007, resulting in a lawsuit that was only settled in 2018, leading to the resulting demolition of the cottages. in the Saugeen and Chief&#x27;s Point reserves, there are four blocks of land encompassing 1,200 cottages that had been subject to ten-year lease agreements, on which a new five-year agreement came into effect in May 2021.

Litigation is underway, in which the Saugeen Ojibway First Nation is claiming the following:

#Compensation resulting from the Crown breaching its fiduciary trust to protect and preserve the territory of the Saugeen Ojibway Nation;
#Aboriginal title over the water territory around the Bruce Peninsula, from the international boundary with the United States in Lake Huron across to Georgian Bay; and
#A declaration that their harvesting (i.e., hunting and fishing) rights within their traditional territory were not extinguished by Treaty 72 of 1854.

In July 2021, the Ontario Superior Court dismissed the first two claims, but upheld the third. It deferred the question of liability with respect to municipal defendants for a subsequent hearing. An appeal has been filed with respect to the dismissals. Settlements on municipal liability have since been reached with Bruce County and Saugeen Shores.

The Saugeen First Nation is pursuing separate litigation relating to the determination of the actual reserve boundary. Treaty 72 had originally provided for the following reservation of land:

A dispute has arisen because the original survey of Amabel Township appears to be at variance with the treaty&#x27;s specifications, with the eastern limit being drawn at 8 miles from the western limit, instead of the 9½ stated. The matter had been partially resolved some years earlier, with certain lands running from Sauble Beach down to Southampton reverting to the reserve. However, another part of the public beach in Sauble Beach, approximately 2 km in length, is still in dispute. The matter has been in protracted litigation, with separate claims being filed in 1990 by the federal government and in 1995 by the First Nation. An attempted settlement, arising from mediation overseen by the former Supreme Court of Canada justice Ian Binnie, collapsed in 2014. The case hearing began in November 2021. In the meantime, some friction has occurred between the First Nation and local authorities over maintenance work being undertaken on the local dunes.

The southern portion of Sauble Beach, known as Sauble Park, is within the limits of the reserve. As of 2018, beach parking is no longer available there, in line with what is already the case at Wasaga Beach and Grand Bend.

In April 2023, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that the entire portion of the fish landing ground fronting on Lake Huron that was reserved from surrender in Treaty 72, being the substantial part of Sauble Beach, continues to be part of the Saugeen reserve, and no third parties have an interest in any part of it. A proposal to allow a life interest to the private landowners being displaced is currently under consideration by the court. The Town of South Bruce Peninsula subsequently announced that it would take the case to the Ontario Court of Appeal.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Bruce County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Municipalities==

<doc id="530010" wikidata="Q754769" url="?curid=530010" title="North Haven, Connecticut">
<text>North Haven is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States on the outskirts of New Haven. The town is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 24,253.

North Haven is home of the Quinnipiac University School of Health Sciences, the School of Nursing, School of Law, School of Education, and School of Medicine on Bassett Road. North Haven has easy access to Interstate 91 and the Wilbur Cross Parkway (Route 15). It is near Sleeping Giant State Park and less than from downtown New Haven and Yale University.

==History==


In his will of 1714, the Reverend James Pierpont (1659–1714) of New Haven gave to his neighbors in the Northeast Parish, as North Haven was called, &quot;provided those neighbors will set their meeting house there and do their training and burying there.&quot;

The first meeting house, completed in 1722, stood on the Green, west of what is now known as the Old Center Cemetery. About half of the original Pierpont gift remains today as the North Haven Green.

Ezra Stiles enumerated about forty families living in North Haven in the early part of the eighteenth century. All of these people were multipurpose farmers, producing what they needed for themselves and their families. In 1786, the General Assembly permitted North Haven to incorporate as a town, separate from New Haven. New roads were built to facilitate communication, namely the Hartford Turnpike in 1798 and the Middletown Turnpike in 1813.

The first United States census counted 1,236 people in the agricultural community of North Haven in 1790. However, the 1789 Grand List had found 1,620 sheep in North Haven, with the sheep outnumbering the residents.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, signs of the Industrial Revolution were apparent. In 1838, the New Haven and Hartford Railroad had laid its tracks along the level sand plains by the Quinnipiac River. In addition, small industries such as the manufacture of agricultural implements in Clintonville began in 1830. In the 1850 census, 62% of the population was listed as farmers. One-third of the residents worked in various nonagricultural occupations such as mechanics, brickmakers, and shoemakers.

After the Civil War, the expanding production of bricks, especially by the I.L. Stiles Co., brought immigrants to North Haven from Ireland, Germany, Italy, and Poland. By 1880, 11 out of 100 people had been born outside of the United States.

In the 1880s, Solomon Linsley, a North Haven architect, built the Memorial Town Hall and the new District 4 School. Linsley designed and built 32 Victorian style houses and public buildings in North Haven.

By 1900, public transportation was important to North Haven residents. Eighteen passenger trains stopped at the Broadway station every day. The Airline Railroad ran through Montowese and Clintonville to Middletown. Trolleys ran from Montowese to New Haven. After 1900, the line was extended north to Wallingford.

After World War I, the automobile changed life in this country town. The brickyards along the river were the major industry. However, residents who owned a car could live in North Haven and commute to New Haven for their jobs. Small real estate development began to grow up along the southern edge of town.

Significant population growth occurred at the end of World War II. North Haven&#x27;s population increased rapidly, quadrupling between 1945 and 1970. The establishment of two factories, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Marlin Firearms, spurred the subsequent population increase. This population shift necessitated the building of a new police station, firehouse, library, and five schools in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate the needs of the growing community. The town continues to grow and expand until this day.

In spite of its rapid growth throughout the past few decades, however, this New England town still retains its town meeting form of government.

Those interested in an in-depth look at the history of North Haven should refer to &quot;Amidst Cultivated and Pleasant Fields: A Bicentennial History of North Haven, Connecticut&quot;
by Lucy McTeer Brusic. Several copies are available to borrow at the North Haven Memorial Library.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 21.1 square miles (54.6 km), of which 20.8 square miles (53.8 km) is land and 0.3 square miles (0.8 km), or 1.52%, is water. North Haven is located less than from Long Island Sound.

North Haven is south of Hartford, northeast of New York City, west of Providence and southwest of Boston. The center of town is an area stretching along U.S. Route 5, from approximately its interchange with I-91 in the north to Bailey Road in the south.

North Haven borders the City of New Haven and the towns of East Haven, Hamden, North Branford, and Wallingford.

<text>Grooming (also called preening) is the art and practice of cleaning and maintaining parts of the body. It is a species-typical behavior.

== In animals ==
Individual animals regularly clean themselves and put their fur, feathers or other skin coverings in good order. This activity is known as personal grooming, a form of hygiene. Extracting foreign objects such as insects, leaves, dirt, twigs and parasites is a form of grooming. Among animals, birds spend considerable time preening their feathers. This is done to remove ectoparasites, keep the feathers in good aerodynamic condition, and waterproof them. To do that, they use the preen oil secreted by the uropygial gland, the dust of down feathers, or other means such as dust-bathing or anting. During oil spills, animal conservationists that rescue penguins sometimes dress them in knitted sweaters to stop them from preening and thereby ingesting the mineral oil, which is poisonous. Monkeys may also pick out nits from their fur or scratch their rears to keep themselves clean. Cats are well known for their extensive grooming. Cats groom so often that they often produce hairballs from the fur they ingest. Many mammal species also groom their genitals after copulation.

== Grooming as a social activity ==

Many social animals adapt preening and grooming behaviors for other social purposes such as bonding and the strengthening of social structures. Grooming plays a particularly important role in forming social bonds in many primate species, such as chacma baboons and wedge-capped capuchins.

== Mutual grooming in human relationships ==

In humankind, mutual grooming relates closely to social grooming, which is defined as the process by which human beings fulfill one of their basic instincts, such as socializing, cooperating and learning from each other.
In research conducted by Holly Nelson (from the University of New Hampshire), individuals who chose their romantic partner reported more mutual grooming than others who focused in other types of relationships. Hence, this study hypothesized that mutual grooming related to relationship satisfaction, trust and previous experience of affection within the family. They claim that even though humans do not groom each other with the same fervor that other species do, they are groomers par excellence. Therefore, human mutual grooming plays an important role in pair bonding.
In the same investigation, researchers found that individuals with more promiscuous attitudes and those who scored high on the anxiety sub-scale on an adult attachment style measure tend to groom their partners more frequently. These findings were also consistent with some of the functions of grooming: potential parental indicator, developing trust and courtship or flirtation.

A recent empirical study by Seinenu Thein-Lemelson (University of California, Berkeley) utilized an ethological approach to examine cross-cultural differences in human grooming as it pertains to caregiving behaviors. Naturalistic data was collected through video focal follows with children during routine activities and then coded for grooming behaviors. This cross-cultural comparison of urban families in Burma and the United States indicates that there are significant cross-cultural differences in rates of caregiver-to-child grooming. Burmese caregivers in the sample groomed children more often than caregivers in the United States. Additionally, children in the United States have short instances of concentrated grooming predominantly during daily activities that are structured explicitly around hygiene goals (bath time), in contrast to the Burmese child, whose grooming is distributed more evenly within and across daily activities. The Burmese parents maintained a constant vigilance with regard to risk of infection. The study is significant because it is the only study of human grooming to utilize naturalistic data.

<text>A timer or countdown timer is a type of clock that starts from a specified time duration and stops upon reaching 00:00. An example of a simple timer is an hourglass. Commonly, a timer triggers an alarm when it ends. A timer can be implemented through hardware or software.
&quot;Stopwatches&quot; operate in the opposite direction, upwards from 00:00, measuring elapsed time since a given time instant. 
&quot;Time switches&quot; are timers that control an electric switch.

==Hardware==

===Mechanical===
Mechanical timers use clockwork to measure time. Manual timers are typically set by turning a dial to the time interval desired, turning the dial stores energy in a mainspring to run the mechanism. They function similarly to a mechanical alarm clock, the energy in the mainspring causes a balance wheel to rotate back and forth. Each swing of the wheel releases the gear train to move forward by a small fixed amount, causing the dial to move steadily backward until it reaches zero when a lever arm strikes a bell. The mechanical kitchen timer was invented in 1926.

The simplest and oldest type of mechanical timer is the hourglass - which is also known as &quot;the glass of the hour&quot; - in which a fixed amount of sand drains through a narrow opening from one chamber to another to measure a time interval.

===Electromechanical===

Short-period bimetallic electromechanical timers use a thermal mechanism, with a metal finger made of strips of two metals with different rates of thermal expansion sandwiched together, steel and bronze are common. An electric current flowing through this finger causes heating of the metals, one side expands less than the other, and an electrical contact on the end of the finger moves away from or towards an electrical switch contact. The most common use of this type is in the &quot;flasher&quot; units that flash turn signals in automobiles, and sometimes in Christmas lights. This is a non-electronic type of multivibrator.

An electromechanical cam timer uses a small synchronous AC motor turning a cam against a comb of switch contacts. The AC motor is turned at an accurate rate by the alternating current, which power companies carefully regulate. Gears drive a shaft at the desired rate, and turn the cam. The most common application of this timer now is in washers, driers and dishwashers. This type of timer often has a friction clutch between the gear train and the cam, so that the cam can be turned to reset the time.

Electromechanical timers survive in these applications because mechanical switch contacts may still be less expensive than the semiconductor devices needed to control powerful lights, motors and heaters.

In the past, these electromechanical timers were often combined with electrical relays to create electro-mechanical controllers. Electromechanical timers reached a high state of development in the 1950s and 1960s because of their extensive use in aerospace and weapons systems. Programmable electromechanical timers controlled launch sequence events in early rockets and ballistic missiles. As digital electronics has progressed and dropped in price, electronic timers have become more advantageous.

Electronic timers are essentially quartz clocks with special electronics, which can achieve higher precision than mechanical timers. They have digital electronics, but may have an analog or digital display. Integrated circuits have made digital logic so inexpensive that an electronic timer is now less expensive than many mechanical and electromechanical timers. Individual timers are implemented as a simple single-chip computer system, similar to a watch and usually utilizing the same, mass-produced technology.

Nowadays, many timers are implemented in software. Modern controllers use a programmable logic controller (PLC) instead of a box full of electromechanical parts. The logic is usually designed as if it were relays, utilizing a special computer language called ladder logic. In PLCs, timers are usually simulated by the software built into the controller. Each timer is just an entry in a table maintained by the software.

Computer systems typically have at least one hardware timer. These are typically digital counters that either increment or decrement at a fixed frequency, which is often configurable, and which interrupt the processor when reaching zero. An alternative design uses a counter with a sufficiently large word size that it will not reach its overflow limit before the end of life of the system.

More sophisticated timers may have comparison logic to compare the timer value against a specific value set by software, which triggers some action when the timer value matches the preset value. This might be used, for example, to measure events or generate pulse-width modulated waveforms to control the speed of motors (using a class D digital electronic amplifier).

One specialist use of hardware timers in computer systems is as watchdog timers, which are designed to perform a hardware reset of the system if the software fails.

==Software==
These types of timers are not devices nor parts of devices, they exist only as software. They rely on the accuracy of a clock generator usually built into a hardware device that runs the software.

===Applications===
Due to the increasing popularity of mobile phones, many timer apps have been developed that mimic the old mechanical timer, but which have also highly sophisticated functions. These apps are also easier to use, because they are available at once, without any need to purchase or carry separate devices. Timers can be software applications phones, smartwatches, or tablets. Some of these apps are countdown timers, stopwatches, etc. These timer apps can be set for a specific time and can be used for tracking working or training time, motivating children to do tasks, replacing an hourglass-form egg timer in board games such as Boggle, or for the traditional purpose of tracking time when cooking.

Apps may be superior to hour glasses, or to mechanical timers. Hour glasses are not precise and clear, and they can jam. Mechanical timers lack the customization that applications support, such as sound volume adjustments for individual needs. Most applications will also offer selectable alarm sounds.

Some timer applications can help children to understand the concept of time, help them to finish tasks in time, and help them to get motivated. These applications are especially used with children with disabilities like ADHD, Down syndrome, etc., but everybody else can also benefit from them.

<text>MathCounts, stylized as MATHCOUNTS, is a nonprofit organization that provides grades 6-8 extracurricular mathematics programs in all U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands. Its mission is to provide engaging math programs for middle school students of all ability levels to build confidence and improve attitudes about math and problem solving. 

In MathCounts, testing is conducted in four separate rounds; the Sprint, Target, Team, and Countdown rounds. 

The Sprint Round consists of 30 problems to be completed within the time limit of 40 minutes. This round is meant to test the accuracy and speed of the competitor. As a result of the difficulty and time constraints, many competitors will not finish all of the problems in the Sprint Round. 

The Target Round consists of 8 problems. Problems are presented in sets of two, with each set having a 6 minute time limit. Calculators are permitted on this portion of the test. This round is meant to test the accuracy and problem solving skills of the competitor. Many later problems are highly difficult, even with the aid of a calculator, and it is common for some students to leave questions blank.

The Team Round consists of 10 problems to be solved in 20 minutes. This round, similar to the Target Round, allows use of a calculator. Only the four students on a school or state&#x27;s team can take this round officially. The Team Round is meant to test the collaboration and problem solving skills of the team.

The Countdown Round is an optional round with a buzzer type question format. Competitors can buzz in to answer questions. Execution of the Countdown Round varies from different locations, with some using a one-on-one format and some having multiple competitors at the buzzers at the same time. The Countdown Round may be official(has an impact on your score) or unofficial depending on the location. The Countdown Round is meant to test the speed and reflexes of a competitor. The Countdown Round is the official determinant of the National Champion at MathCounts Nationals.

Topics covered in the competition include geometry, counting, probability, number theory, and algebra.

== History ==
Mathcounts was started in 1983 by the National Society of Professional Engineers, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and CNA Insurance to increase middle school interest in mathematics. The first national-level competition was held in 1984. The Mathcounts Competition Series spread quickly in middle schools, and today it is the best-known middle school mathematics competition. In 2007, Mathcounts launched the National Math Club as a noncompetitive alternative to the Competition Series. In 2011, Mathcounts launched the Math Video Challenge Program, which was discontinued in 2023.

2020 was the only year since 1984 in which a national competition was not held, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The &quot;MATHCOUNTS Week&quot; event featuring problems from the 2020 State Competition was held on the Art of Problem Solving website as a replacement. The 2021 National Competition was held online.

Current sponsors include RTX Corporation, U.S. Department of Defense STEM, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, National Society of Professional Engineers, 3M, Texas Instruments, Art of Problem Solving, Bentley Systems, Carina Initiatives, National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, CNA Financial, Google, Brilliant, and Mouser Electronics.

== Competition Series ==

The Competition Series is divided into four levels: school, chapter, state, and national. Students progress to each level in the competition based on performance at the previous level. As the levels progress, the problems become more challenging. Each level has many rounds, always including a Sprint Round (30 questions, 40 minutes) and a Target Round (4 pairs of harder problems with calculator use, 6 minutes each pair).

All students are either school-based competitors or non-school competitors (&quot;NSCs&quot;). Most students participate through their schools, starting with a school-level competition. A student whose school is not participating in the Competition Series starts at the chapter level as an NSC, competing individually.

=== School level ===
Coaches of each school select up to 12 students from their school to advance to the chapter competition, with 4 of them competing on the official school team. The rest compete individually.

=== Chapter level ===
All qualifying students compete individually. Students on an official school team also compete as a team. The Countdown Round is optional and can either be used to determine top individuals or as an unofficial round. The top teams and individuals advance to the state competition. The exact number of qualifiers varies by region.

=== State level ===
All qualifying students compete individually. Students on a qualifying school team also compete as a team. The Countdown Round is optional and can either be used to determine top individuals or as an unofficial round. The top 4 individuals qualify for the national competition. The coach of the winning school team is the coach for the state team. Some states have universities within the state that give scholarships to the top individuals of the state.

=== National level ===

Qualifying students and coaches receive an all-expenses-paid trip to the national competition. The competition typically lasts 3–4 days on Mother&#x27;s Day weekend. The coach of the state team is the supervisor for the team. The students compete individually for the title of national champion. They also compete as a team to represent their state.

The 12 highest scoring individuals advance to the Countdown Round. The winner of this round is declared the National Champion.

Scholarships and prizes are awarded to the top individuals and top state teams. In the past, prizes have included trips to Space Camp or to the White House to meet the current President of the United States.

== National Math Club ==
In addition to the Competition Series program, students can also participate in the National Math Club program.

The National Math Club program allows schools and non-school groups to start a math club for free. Upon registering, club leaders earn free online access to dozens of games, explorations, and problem sets.

Clubs that meet at least five times during the program year can achieve Silver Level Status, and clubs that complete a creative and collaborative project can achieve Gold Level Status. Clubs that achieve Silver Level and Gold Level can earn prizes and recognition.

== Other programs ==

=== Alumni scholarships ===
Each year, Mathcounts awards two types of scholarships to multiple alumni who participated in at least one of the Mathcounts programs during middle school. The Mathcounts Alumni Scholarship is awarded to alumni whose experience in Mathcounts was extremely influential, and the Community Coaching Scholarship is awarded to alumni who start Mathcounts programs at underserved schools.

=== Math Video Challenge ===
In 2011, Mathcounts started the Reel Math Challenge (later renamed to the Math Video Challenge). The Math Video Challenge program allowed students in teams of 4 to create a video that explained the solution to a problem from the Mathcounts School Handbook in a real-world scenario. The program was discontinued in 2023, but a similar video project opportunity is offered through the National Math Club.

<doc id="530043" wikidata="Q2707849" url="?curid=530043" title="Holbrookia">
<text>Holbrookia is a genus of earless lizards, known commonly as the lesser earless lizards, in the family Phrynosomatidae. The genus contains six recognized species, which are found throughout the Southwestern and Central United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by having no external ear openings, presumably to prevent soil from entering their bodies when they are digging.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Holbrookia&quot;, is in honor of American zoologist John Edwards Holbrook.

==Description==
Lesser earless lizards grow to about 2.0–2.5 in (50–65 mm) snout-to-vent length (SVL), plus a tail of 3–4 in (75–100 mm). They are typically grey or tan in color, with black blotching. The males usually have blue patches on either side of their bellies, whereas the females do not. Females often change to have bright orange patches when gravid.

==Behavior==
&quot;Holbrookia&quot; species are diurnal, basking lizards. They spend the vast majority of their time sunning on rocks, even in the heat of the day, until the surface temperature reaches around 104 °F (40 °C), when they will retreat to a rock crevice or burrow.

==Diet==
Lesser earless lizards are insectivorous.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Holbrookia&quot; contains six species which are recognized as being valid.
==Geographic range==
Earless lizards (genera &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Holbrookia&quot;) are found in the Southwestern and Central United States, in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and as far north as Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. They are also found in Mexico, in the states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Sinaloa, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz.

<doc id="530046" wikidata="Q2703208" url="?curid=530046" title="Knobcone pine">
<text>The knobcone pine, Pinus attenuata (also called &quot;Pinus tuberculata&quot;), is a tree that grows in mild climates on poor soils. It ranges from the mountains of southern Oregon to Baja California with the greatest concentration in northern California and the Oregon-California border.

==Description==
Individual specimens can live up to a century. The crown is usually conical with a straight trunk. It reaches heights of , but can be a shrub on especially poor sites. The bark is thin and smooth, flaky and gray-brown when young, becoming dark gray-red-brown and shallowly furrowed into flat scaly ridges in age. The twigs are red-brown and often resinous. Its wood is knotty and of little interest for lumber.

The leaves are in fascicles of three, needle-like, yellow-green, twisted, and long. The cones are resin-sealed and irregularly shaped, long and clustered in whorls of three to six on the branches. The scales end in a short stout prickle. Cones can sometimes be found attached to the trunk and larger branches.
==Distribution==
The knobcone pine can be found growing in the dry, rocky soils of southern Oregon and northern California, between above sea level. It forms nearly pure stands, preferring to grow where there is no competition.

==Ecology==
On the coast, the knobcone pine may hybridize with bishop pine (&quot;Pinus muricata&quot;), and Monterey pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;).

In the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, knobcone pine is often a co-dominant with blue oak (&quot;Quercus douglasii&quot;).

The species is susceptible to fire, but this melts the cone resin, releasing seeds for regrowth. The species seems to be shade intolerant.

<text>James Anthony Bailey (July 4, 1847 – April 11, 1906) (né McGinnis), was an American owner and manager of several 19th-century circuses, including the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus (also billed as &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;).

==Early life==
James Anthony McGinnis was born July 4, 1847 to Edward and Hannora McGinnis in Detroit, Michigan. Edward McGinnis died in October, 1849 of cholera and in 1855, James was orphaned when his mother died. James then went to live with his older sister, Catherine Gordon.

Life with Catherine was difficult as she tended to be overbearing and harsh. Sometime between 1859 and 1860, James ran away from Catherine&#x27;s home and found a job and a place to stay on a farm about 10 miles outside the city of Pontiac, Michigan. Finding life on the farm unrewarding, 13-year old James wandered into Pontiac where he found work at the Hodges House Hotel.

After working at the hotel for a time, he was discovered by Colonel Frederic Harrison Bailey, a nephew of circus pioneer Hachaliah Bailey, and an advance man for John Robinson and Bill Lake&#x27;s traveling circus. F.H. Bailey gave McGinnis a job as his assistant, and the two traveled together for many years. McGinnis eventually adopted F.H. Bailey&#x27;s surname to become James A. Bailey.

==Circus life==
In his diary, James&#x27; brother-in-law Joe McCaddon writes that Bailey recounted stories of how he left the circus world at age 16 and went to work as clerk to a sutler during the Civil War.

In 1866, with the war over, he went back to work for Bill Lake, who now owned his own circus with his wife Agnes Lake Thatcher. During this time, James met Ruth Louisa McCaddon of Zanesville, Ohio. James and Ruth became friends, fell in love, and were married in December 1868. The very next year in Granby, Missouri, Bill Lake was shot and killed. With her husband dead, Agnes Lake became the first woman in the United States to own a circus (Agnes Lake would later marry famous gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok, who worked for a short time with Buffalo Bill Cody, whose Wild West Show James A. Bailey would one day manage). 

Bailey later associated with James E. Cooper, and by the time he was 22, he was manager of the Cooper and Bailey circus. He then met with P.T. Barnum, and together they established Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Circus (for which Bailey was instrumental in obtaining Jumbo the Elephant) in 1880, with their combined show opening the following spring in Madison Square Garden.

Barnum was the face of the circus, but James Bailey was the hard worker who insisted on staying behind the scenes. Barnum once wrote to him that James managed the show “ten times better than I could.”

Equestrienne Josie Demott Robinson wrote in her autobiography that &quot;Mr. Barnum was the advertiser, who loved the limelight, who rode around in the ring, and announced who he was. But Mr. Bailey was the businessman, content to be invisible ... and interested only in the success of the show.&quot;

Bailey was considered by many to be a genius at logistics. His organizational skills for transporting people, animals, and equipment was copied by the military of more than one country.

He hired Pinkerton Detectives to travel with the show and protect circusgoers from grifters and thieves.

He established “Orphan Day”, one day a year when orphans could attend the circus for free. He was often known to carry children who could not walk into the circus tent and find them a seat away from the crush of the crowd.

Following Barnum&#x27;s death in 1891, Bailey managed not only The Barnum and Bailey Greatest Show on Earth, but in 1894, took on the management of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show.

==Death and legacy==
Bailey died of erysipelas in 1906 at age 58 at his home in Mount Vernon, NY.
He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, in The Bronx, New York City. His widow subsequently sold the circus to the Ringling brothers in 1907, who eventually merged the rival operations in 1919.

In his book about the circus, Earl Chapin May wrote, “Probably...no circus owner and manager left more sincere mourners than the thin little magnate known to millions as James A. Bailey.”

Taped beneath a photo of James Bailey in the scrapbook of employee Harrison Gunning is a small scrap of paper that reads, “P.T. Barnum was the great showman, but Mr. Bailey was the supreme of all circus managers, past and present.”

James A. Bailey was inducted into the International Circus Hall of Fame in 1960 and into the Circus Ring of Fame in Sarasota, Florida in 1990.

<doc id="530060" wikidata="Q1189744" url="?curid=530060" title="Pfaffian">
<text>In mathematics, the determinant of an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;m&quot; skew-symmetric matrix can always be written as the square of a polynomial in the matrix entries, a polynomial with integer coefficients that only depends on &quot;m&quot;. When &quot;m&quot; is odd, the polynomial is zero, and when &quot;m&quot; is even, it is a nonzero polynomial of degree &quot;m&quot;/2, and is unique up to multiplication by &amp;pm;1. The convention on skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrices, given below in the examples, then determines one specific polynomial, called the Pfaffian polynomial. The value of this polynomial, when applied to the entries of a skew-symmetric matrix, is called the Pfaffian of that matrix. The term Pfaffian was introduced by , who indirectly named them after Johann Friedrich Pfaff. 

Explicitly, for a skew-symmetric matrix formula_1,
: formula_2
which was first proved by , who cites Jacobi for introducing these polynomials in work on Pfaffian systems of differential equations. Cayley obtains this relation by specialising a more general result on matrices that deviate from skew symmetry only in the first row and the first column. The determinant of such a matrix is the product of the Pfaffians of the two matrices obtained by first setting in the original matrix the upper left entry to zero and then copying, respectively, the negative transpose of the first row to the first column and the negative transpose of the first column to the first row. This is proved by induction by expanding the determinant on minors and employing the recursion formula below.

== Examples ==
: formula_3

: formula_4
(3 is odd, so the Pfaffian of B is 0)

: formula_5

The Pfaffian of a 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix is given as
: formula_6
(Note that any skew-symmetric matrix can be reduced to this form; see Spectral theory of a skew-symmetric matrix.)

== Formal definition ==

Let &quot;A&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;&quot;ij&quot;) be a 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; skew-symmetric matrix. The Pfaffian of &quot;A&quot; is explicitly defined by the formula

:formula_7
where &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot; is the symmetric group of degree 2&quot;n&quot; and sgn(σ) is the signature of σ.

One can make use of the skew-symmetry of &quot;A&quot; to avoid summing over all possible permutations. Let Π be the set of all partitions of into pairs without regard to order. There are such partitions. An element can be written as
: formula_8
with and formula_9. Let
: formula_10
be the corresponding permutation. Given a partition α as above, define
: formula_11
The Pfaffian of &quot;A&quot; is then given by
: formula_12

The Pfaffian of a &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; skew-symmetric matrix for &quot;n&quot; odd is defined to be zero, as the determinant of an odd skew-symmetric matrix is zero, since for a skew-symmetric matrix,
formula_13
and for &quot;n&quot; odd, this implies formula_14.

=== Recursive definition ===

By convention, the Pfaffian of the 0 × 0 matrix is equal to one. The Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; with can be computed recursively as
: formula_15
where the index &quot;i&quot; can be selected arbitrarily, formula_16 is the Heaviside step function, and formula_17 denotes the matrix &quot;A&quot; with both the &quot;i&quot;-th and &quot;j&quot;-th rows and columns removed. Note how for the special choice formula_18 this reduces to the simpler expression:
: formula_19

=== Alternative definitions ===
One can associate to any skew-symmetric 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; matrix a bivector
: formula_20
where is the standard basis of R2&quot;n&quot;. The Pfaffian is then defined by the equation
: formula_21
here &quot;ω&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;n&quot; denotes the wedge product of &quot;n&quot; copies of &quot;ω&quot;.

Equivalently, we can consider the bivector (which is more convenient when we do not want to impose the summation constraint formula_22):
formula_23
which gives formula_24

A non-zero generalisation of the Pfaffian to odd-dimensional matrices is given in the work of de Bruijn on multiple integrals involving determinants. In particular for any &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;, we use the formal definition above but set formula_25. For &quot;m&quot; odd, one can then show that this is equal to the usual Pfaffian of an (&quot;m&quot;+1) × (&quot;m&quot;+1)-dimensional skew symmetric matrix where we have added an (&quot;m&quot;+1)th column consisting of &quot;m&quot; elements 1, an (&quot;m&quot;+1)th row consisting of &quot;m&quot; elements −1, and the corner element is zero. The usual properties of Pfaffians, for example the relation to the determinant, then apply to this extended matrix.

== Properties and identities ==

Pfaffians have the following properties, which are similar to those of determinants.
* Multiplication of a row and a column by a constant is equivalent to multiplication of the Pfaffian by the same constant.
* Simultaneous interchange of two different rows and corresponding columns changes the sign of the Pfaffian.
* A multiple of a row and corresponding column added to another row and corresponding column does not change the value of the Pfaffian.
Using these properties, Pfaffians can be computed quickly, akin to the computation of determinants.

=== Miscellaneous ===

For a 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; skew-symmetric matrix &quot;A&quot;
: formula_26
: formula_27
: formula_28
For an arbitrary 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;B&quot;,
: formula_29
Substituting in this equation &quot;B = Am&quot;, one gets for all integer &quot;m&quot;
: formula_30

=== Derivative identities ===

If &quot;A&quot; depends on some variable &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, then the gradient of a Pfaffian is given by
: formula_31
and the Hessian of a Pfaffian is given by
: formula_32

=== Trace identities ===

The product of the Pfaffians of skew-symmetric matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; can be represented in the form of an exponential
: formula_33

Suppose &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; skew-symmetric matrices, then
: formula_34
and &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;s&quot;1,&quot;s&quot;2...,&quot;s&quot;n) are Bell polynomials.

=== Block matrices ===

For a block-diagonal matrix
:: formula_35
: formula_36
For an arbitrary &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;M&quot;:
: formula_37

It is often required to compute the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix formula_38 with the block structure
: formula_39
where formula_40 and formula_41 are skew-symmetric matrices and formula_42 is a general rectangular matrix.

When formula_40 is invertible, one has
: formula_44
This can be seen from Aitken block-diagonalization formula,
: formula_45
This decomposition involves a congruence transformations that allow to use the Pfaffian property formula_46.

Similarly, when formula_41 is invertible, one has
: formula_48
as can be seen by employing the decomposition 
: formula_49

== Calculating the Pfaffian numerically ==
Suppose &quot;A&quot; is a &quot;2n × 2n&quot; skew-symmetric matrices, then
: formula_50
where formula_51 is the second Pauli matrix, formula_52 is an identity matrix of dimension &quot;n&quot; and we took the trace over a matrix logarithm.

This equality is based on the trace identity
: formula_53
and on the observation that formula_54.

Since calculating the logarithm of a matrix is a computationally demanding task, one can instead compute all eigenvalues of formula_55, take the log of all of these and sum them up. This procedure merely exploits the property formula_56. This can be implemented in Mathematica with a single statement:
: codice_1
However, this algorithm is unstable when the Pfaffian is large. The eigenvalues of formula_57 will generally be complex, and the logarithm of these complex eigenvalues are generally taken to be in formula_58. Under the summation, for a real valued Pfaffian, the argument of the exponential will be given in the form formula_59 for some integer formula_60. When formula_61 is very large, rounding errors in computing the resulting sign from the complex phase can lead to a non-zero imaginary component.

For other (more) efficient algorithms see .

== Applications ==
* There exist programs for the numerical computation of the Pfaffian on various platforms (Python, Matlab, Mathematica) .
* The Pfaffian is an invariant polynomial of a skew-symmetric matrix under a proper orthogonal change of basis. As such, it is important in the theory of characteristic classes. In particular, it can be used to define the Euler class of a Riemannian manifold that is used in the generalized Gauss–Bonnet theorem.
* The number of perfect matchings in a planar graph is given by a Pfaffian, hence is polynomial time computable via the FKT algorithm. This is surprising given that for general graphs, the problem is very difficult (so called #P-complete). This result is used to calculate the number of domino tilings of a rectangle, the partition function of Ising models in physics, or of Markov random fields in machine learning (; ), where the underlying graph is planar. It is also used to derive efficient algorithms for some otherwise seemingly intractable problems, including the efficient simulation of certain types of restricted quantum computation. See Holographic algorithm for more information.

<doc id="530064" wikidata="Q1373738" url="?curid=530064" title="Mount Suribachi">
<text>is a -high mountain on the southwest end of Iwo Jima in the northwest Pacific Ocean under the administration of Ogasawara Subprefecture, Tokyo Metropolis, Japan.

The mountain&#x27;s name derives from its shape, resembling a &quot;suribachi&quot; or grinding bowl. It is also known as , since the volcanic gas and water vapor that rolls in from the summit, alongside the rest of the island, give the appearance of a smoking pipe when viewed from the sea.

Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s iconic World War II photograph, &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;, depicting United States Marines raising an American flag, was taken at the mountain&#x27;s peak during the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Ammunition ship USS &quot;Suribachi&quot; was named after this mountain.

==Geology==
Geologically, the mountain is a cinder cone of andesite, formed by volcanic activity. It is thought that the mountain is a dormant vent to a still active volcano (designated Iō-tō, the name of the island as a whole). From 1889 to 1957, the Japanese government recorded sixteen eruptions on the peak. One eruption lasted for sixty-five minutes, and created a crater with a diameter of 35 meters and a depth of fifteen meters on the runway near the former airfield from World War II. The Japanese Meteorological Agency reported that on May 2, 2012, a small eruption caused water discoloration to the northeast, and confirmed the appearance of a new fumarole.

==History==
During World War II, the Japanese built tunnel and bunker systems in and on Mount Suribachi. In February 1945, United States Marines invaded the island and initiated a major battle. For the United States, Iwo Jima was an important strategic point between the United States and mainland Japan, needed for its close proximity to Japan as an airstrip for supporting aircraft in Japanese mainland bombing operations but became useful for damaged B-29s returning to the Mariana Islands from bombing Japan, a status that resulted in severe fighting that led to over 20,000 American casualties and close to 20,000 Japanese killed.

==In popular culture==

*During the Battle of Iwo Jima, Marines captured Mount Suribachi and raised a small American flag. Their officers ordered it replaced with a larger one, and photographer Joe Rosenthal took his famous picture, &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;. The photograph has become an iconic image and is depicted as a large statue at the Marine Corps War Memorial.
*The 1949 film &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;, directed by Allan Dwan and starring John Wayne, follows a United States Marine rifle squad preparing for battle at Iwo Jima. The 2006 films &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; and &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood, treat the theme of this Pacific battle and present the positions of both belligerents in this conflict.

<doc id="530079" wikidata="Q452445" url="?curid=530079" title="Antonio Lamer">
<text>Joseph Antonio Charles Lamer (July 8, 1933 – November 24, 2007) was a Canadian lawyer and jurist who served as the 16th Chief Justice of Canada from 1990 to 2000.

==Career==
Lamer practised in partnership at the firm of Cutler, Lamer, Bellemare and Associates and was a full professor in the Faculty of Law, Université de Montréal, where he was also a lecturer in criminology.

On December 19, 1969, at the age of 36, he was appointed to the Quebec Superior Court and to the Queen&#x27;s Bench (Crown Side) of the province of Quebec. In 1978, he was elevated to the Quebec Court of Appeal and was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1980. Brian Mulroney named Lamer as Chief Justice on July 1, 1990.

On January 7, 2000, Lamer took an unexpected early retirement after having served as chief justice for ten years. Several years after his death, former judges spoke about the situation surrounding his retirement. According to a 2011 article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, in February 1999, a &quot;delegation of three veteran judges&quot; including former Supreme Court judge John C. Major, selected by their colleagues met with Lamer to tell him that &quot;his performance was not what it had been up until this time.&quot; To which he immediately responded, &quot;Well, then I&#x27;ll resign.&quot; Lamer finally agreed to resign following a second meeting with Justices Major, Peter Cory and Charles Gonthier in the spring of 1999. He announced in an August 1999 talk to the Canadian Bar Association, that he would be resigning from the Supreme Court in January 2000.

After he retired, Lamer joined a large law firm, Stikeman Elliott, in a senior advisory role and was appointed associate professor of law at the Université de Montréal in 2000. He was appointed Communications Security Establishment Commissioner on June 19, 2003, a position he held until August 1, 2006. He also served as honorary colonel of the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards.

In a CBC interview, Lamer described how the Supreme Court of Canada was transformed following the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms under then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau which expanded the role of the judiciary. Lamer described it as &quot;somewhat of a shock to see their job description changed so fundamentally.&quot; Eugene Meehan, who was Lamer&#x27;s first executive legal officer at the Supreme Court of Canada described Lamer as &quot;a foundational builder&quot;, who was &quot;one of the key architects of how courts interpret&quot; the 1982 Charter&quot; ...&quot;building on the work of his predecessor as chief justice, Brian Dickson.&quot;

In March 2003, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador asked Lamer to head a public inquiry into several wrongful convictions in Newfoundland specifically to oversee an inquiry into how the criminal justice system dealt with three discredited murder convictions. The hearings lasted about three years. Lamer was tasked to conduct an investigation into the death of Catherine Carroll and the circumstances surrounding the resulting criminal proceedings against Gregory Parsons, and an investigation into the death of Brenda Young and the circumstances surrounding the resulting criminal proceedings against Randy Druken. Lamer was also asked to inquire as to why Ronald Dalton&#x27;s appeal of his murder conviction took eight years before it was brought on for a hearing in the Court of Appeal.

==Personal life==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Lamer served in the Royal Canadian Artillery from 1950 to 1954 and in the Canadian Intelligence Corps from 1954 to 1960. In 1956, he graduated in law from the Université de Montréal and was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1957.

In 1987, he married Danièle Tremblay-Lamer, who was later appointed a judge on the Federal Court.

During his tenure he was well known among the bench to be a frequent consumer of alcohol, especially wine, and have various drug prescriptions to deal with his declining health. Various commentators and even other judges have vocally critiqued these habits of his as reason for him to resign from the court.

He died in Ottawa of a cardiac condition on November 24, 2007, and was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

==Recognition==
He was a Companion of the Order of Canada. He received honorary degrees from the Université de Moncton, University of Ottawa, Université de Montréal, University of Toronto, University of New Brunswick, Dalhousie University, University of British Columbia, and Saint Paul University.

From 1992 to 1998, Chief Justice Lamer was Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the 62nd (Shawinigan) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA.

In January 1972, Genesee Community College relocated to its current permanent address on One College Road in the town of Batavia.

In 1991, GCC would see expansion with the addition of the Stuart Steiner Theatre, which houses a theater and stage, as well as expanded classrooms for the various arts programs. In 2000, the Conable Technology Building was added to the main campus facilities, a two-story annex that is the center for most of GCC&#x27;s technological programs and apparatus. In January 2006, GCC expanded again, adding the Wolcott J. Humphrey III Student Union, a central location for student affairs and organizations.

In February 2009, the plans for another campus center in Lima was announced, which will replace the Lakeville satellite campus and in June 2009, construction of the campus was completed. The campus features two modern computer labs and a state-of-the-art science lab, five to seven classrooms, a lobby and reception area, as well as faculty, staff, advisor, and administrative offices.

==Academics==

Genesee Community College offers over 60 associate degree and certificate programs. Many students of the associate degree programs eventually transfer to four-year schools to complete their degree. College-ready students can complete their choice of 16 fully online programs at GCC.

==Athletics==
Genesee Community College currently has 14 intercollegiate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in basketball, baseball, lacrosse, soccer, softball, golf, swimming, cheerleading, and volleyball. Collectively, they are known as the Cougars, and their colors are blue and gold.

==Roz Steiner Gallery==
The Roz Steiner Gallery is Genesee Community College&#x27;s (GCC) only gallery and is located in Batavia, New York, United States. The gallery is located in GCC&#x27;s Center for the Arts, to the east of the Stuart Steiner Theatre lobby. The Roz Steiner Gallery opened in spring 2011. While the Steiner Gallery does not house a permanent collection, it typically features three professional exhibitions and two student-work exhibitions each academic year. The gallery was financed with funding from the State University of New York Construction Fund, and gifts from the Genesee Community College Foundation and Genesee Community College Association.

== Media ==
GCC also has a radio station called The Music. It can be heard on 90.7 FM and online. It broadcasts to an approximately radius of the school.

<text>Hachaliah Lyman Bailey (pronounced &quot;heck-a-LIE-uh&quot;; July 31, 1775 – September 2, 1845) was the founder of one of America&#x27;s earliest circuses. In 1808, he purchased an Indian elephant which he named &quot;Old Bet&quot; and which was one of the first such animals to reach America. With &quot;Old Bet&quot; as its main attraction, he formed the Bailey Circus, which also included a trained dog, several pigs, a horse and four wagons. This was the impetus for what in time evolved into the Bailey component of what became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.
Between 1820 and 1825, Bailey built the Elephant Hotel in Somers, New York. The hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Bailey also served two terms in the New York State legislature.

In 1837, Bailey sold the hotel and moved to Northern Virginia, bought the land surrounding the intersection of Leesburg Pike and Columbia Pike in Fairfax County, Virginia near Falls Church, Virginia, and gave Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads his name. The Crossroads then became the winter quarters for his circus.

In 1845 Hachaliah returned to Somers for a visit and died from the kick of a horse while there. He is buried in Somers&#x27; Ivandell Cemetery.

Several of the next generation of Baileys performed in circuses. Hachaliah Bailey served as a role model to a young P.T. Barnum, who wrote of meeting him when Hachaliah visited Barnum&#x27;s store in Bethel, Connecticut. In 1888, Barnum lent his name to a partnership with James Anthony Bailey, who had adopted the surname of Frederick Bailey, a nephew of Hachaliah&#x27;s, to form the Barnum and Bailey Circus.

==Early career==
Hachaliah Bailey was born in the small village of Somers, New York on July 31, 1775. His parents were James Bailey and Anne Brown Bailey. Hachaliah was one of six children, Mary Bailey, Stephen Bailey, Lewis Bailey, Jane Bailey and Anna Bailey Owens.

Like his father, Hachaliah became a farmer where he farmed land and raised cattle. Hachaliah married Mary Purdy and they had five children. Hachaliah Bailey was also known for finding other ways to make an income. He became one of the directors of the Croton Turnpike Company, this eventually turned into a toll road through the middle of Somers where it became a major route. This route was used to transport cattle to the Hudson. Another way Hachaliah made a profit was by becoming a part-owner of a sloop which was used to transport farm animals.

Hachaliah and many locals frequented a bar called the Bull Head Tavern. This is where Hachaliah bought his elephant Old Bet for only $1,000. Old Bet&#x27;s name drew from Hachaliah&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth whose nickname was Young Beth. Old Bet was the second elephant ever to be brought to the United States. Hachaliah brought the elephant to Hudson Valley in 1805 and then New York City in 1806. Old Bet was originally supposed to be used as a draft animal, however, it didn&#x27;t take long for Hachaliah to realize the rising interest that Americans had for exotic animals. Hachaliah then used this intrigue and began traveling at night so no one could get a glimpse of the animal and he would charge 25 cents per person to see Old Bet.

Hachaliah then decided to showcase Old Bet in a small circus. After Hachaliah&#x27;s neighbors saw the booming success the exotic creature brought to Hachaliah, most of his neighbors started buying and showcasing exotic animals. Soon after Somers became known for its intriguing animals. By 1808 Hachaliah took on two partners Benjamin Lent and Andrew Brunn each paying $1200 for one/third of the interest on Old Bet. Hachaliah also owned two more elephants after Old Bet was shot on tour by a local farmer who was angry with the amount of money and attention that was being spent on an elephant. Hachaliah then memorialized Old Bet by creating the Elephant Hotel and building a statue in her honor.

==Marriages and children==
Hachaliah Bailey married his wife Mary Purdy when she was fourteen years old and he was twenty-three years old. Together they had five children:
* Calista Bailey (1800–1879)
* Lewis Bailey (1803–1870)
* Jane Bailey (1808–1882)
* Joseph Turk Bailey (1810–1881)
* Stephen Bailey (1814–1863)

Hachaliah Bailey then would split with Mary and later marry his wife Ruth Ferris Bailey where they had no children.

<text>The Port of Houston is one of the world&#x27;s largest ports and serves the metropolitan area of Houston, Texas. The port is a complex of diversified public and private facilities located a few hours&#x27; sailing time from the Gulf of Mexico. Located in the fourth-largest city in the United States, it is the busiest port in the U.S. in terms of foreign tonnage and the busiest in the U.S. in terms of overall tonnage. Though originally the port&#x27;s terminals were primarily within the Houston city limits, the port has expanded to such a degree that today it has facilities in multiple communities in the surrounding area. In particular the port&#x27;s busiest terminal, the Barbours Cut Terminal, is located in Morgan&#x27;s Point.

The Port of Houston is a cooperative entity consisting of both the port authority, which operates the major terminals along the Houston Ship Channel, and more than 150 private companies situated along Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay. Many petroleum corporations have built refineries along the channel where they are partially protected from the threat of major storms in the Gulf of Mexico. The petrochemical complex associated with the Port of Houston is one of the largest in the world.

==History==

The original Port of Houston was located at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou in downtown Houston by the . This area is called &quot;Allen&#x27;s Landing&quot; and is now a park. It is the birthplace of the City of Houston.

Shipping points grew at multiple locations on Buffalo Bayou including the port of Harrisburg (now part of Houston) and the docks on the Allen Ranch. By the end of the 19th century Buffalo Bayou had become a major shipping channel with traffic beginning to rival Galveston.

The citizens of Harris County approved creation of the modern port in 1909, believing that an inland port would better serve the region after the destructive Galveston Hurricane of 1900. President Woodrow Wilson officially opened the port to traffic as the World Port of Houston and Buffalo Bayou on November 10, 1914. In the 1930s the Port became the focus of labor conflict, with sometimes intense battles between strikers and authorities, during the 1935 Gulf Coast longshoremen&#x27;s strike and the 1936 Gulf Coast maritime workers&#x27; strike among other incidents.

In 1911, there was a campaign persuading voters to approve a $1.25 million bond to raise money for dredging the waterway. The campaign was successful and voters approved the bond issuance and creation of the Harris County Houston Ship Channel Navigation District that is called Port of Houston Authority (POHA) today.

Early supporters would prove to be correct; the port has grown to be one of the world&#x27;s largest. By 1961, it was already among the busiest ports in the US. In 1977 the Port of Houston opened the Barbours Cut Terminal, Texas&#x27; first cargo container terminal, at Morgan&#x27;s Point. This new terminal, in the Bay Area, quickly became the port&#x27;s most important terminal. The opening of the Bayport Terminal in 2006 further extended the port authority&#x27;s reach outside the city of Houston.

==The port today==

Approximately of cargo moved through the Port in 2005, most of which is petroleum related. The Port has two separate terminals dedicated to the handling of cargo containers: Barbours Cut (at Morgan&#x27;s Point), and Bayport (in Pasadena, opened in October 2006). The Barbours Cut terminal was, in fact, the port&#x27;s first terminal specifically designed for these shipments. Additional general cargo terminals include Turning Basin, Jacintoport, Woodhouse, and Care.

The Port Authority offers a 90-minute free cruise aboard the &quot;M/V Sam Houston&quot;, details of which can be found on its website. Since the Houston Ship Channel is closed to recreational traffic, this is the only means by which the general public can view port operations, and thus the tours are highly popular.

Most Volkswagen (and Audi) automobiles sold in North America pass through the port of Houston.

The Port is operated by the Port of Houston Authority, an independent political subdivision of the State of Texas governed by a seven-member commission. The City of Houston and the Harris County Commissioners Court each appoint two commissioners; these two governmental entities also jointly appoint the chairman of the Port Commission. The Harris County Mayors and Councils Association and the City of Pasadena each appoint one commissioner. Daily operations are overseen by an CEO who serves at the will of the Commission.

A renovation project for the Port&#x27;s Turning Basin Terminal began in 2010 and is expected to take 10 years. The Turning Basin Terminal is a multipurpose complex with open wharves and 37 docks that are used for direct discharge and loading of breakbulk, containerized, project or heavy-lift cargoes. The goal of the renovation is to accommodate the increase in the transportation of steel, which increased more than in the first nine months of 2011, up from over the same period in the previous year.

===Trade data===
The Port of Houston is a major point of international trade for the United States. The following is the trade volume by world region reported by the Greater Houston Partnership as of 2006.
* Europe 31%
* Latin America 22%
* Asia/Pacific Rim 15%
* North America 13%
* Middle East 7%
* Africa 12%

===Foreign Trade Zone===
The Port of Houston Authority manages Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) No. 84, which includes many privately owned and port-owned sites located throughout Houston and Harris County, Texas. The Houston Zone offers users special benefits. For example, customs duties on imported goods entering the FTZ can be delayed until the cargo is removed from the zone. No duty is paid if the merchandise is exported directly from the zone.

The following Sub Zones are a part of The Port of Houston FTZ No. 84:
* 84E Gulf Coast Maritime
* 84F Valero Refining Co.

* 84N Pasadena Refining System, Inc.
* 84O ExxonMobil
* 84P Houston Refining LP
* 84Q Equistar Chemicals
* 84R Michelin North America, Inc.

===List of firsts===
Despite being one of the youngest major ports in the world (the port reached its 100th birthday in 2014) it has already racked up an impressive list of firsts.

Notable firsts include:
* First port to be built with federal funds and local matching funds, thus guaranteeing local support (every port since 1930 has had a local match requirement)
* First direct shipment of cotton to Europe (November 1919 via the &quot;M/V Merry Mount&quot;)
* First double-stack container train (1981)
* When the Baytown Tunnel was removed in 1997 to allow deepening and widening of the Houston Ship Channel (it was replaced by the Fred Hartman Bridge), it was the largest tunnel so removed ( diameter by length) without closing the channel, losing time due to accidents, or impacting the navigational safety of the port.
* First port to conduct air emissions testing of its off-road equipment (2000)
* First port to meet ISO 14001 standards for environmental excellence (2002), and the first port to be recertified to ISO 14001 standards (2004)

In 1968 Texas historian Marilyn McAdams Sibley published &quot;The Port of Houston: A History&quot;.

<doc id="530086" wikidata="Q7023609" url="?curid=530086" title="Niagara County Community College">
<text>SUNY Niagara (alternatively Niagara County Community College, or NCCC) is a public community college in Sanborn, New York. Founded in 1962, NCCC is sponsored by Niagara County and offers associate degrees as part of the State University of New York system. Dual admissions programs facilitate transfer to four-year colleges upon completion of the two-year degree programs. NCCC operates the Niagara Falls Culinary Institute as a remote campus within the former Rainbow Centre Factory Outlet in downtown Niagara Falls, New York.

== History ==
The college&#x27;s first campus opened on September 30, 1963 within a former Nabisco factory at 430 Buffalo Avenue in downtown Niagara Falls, New York.

The current campus opened on February 5, 1973 at the corner of New York State Route 31 and New York State Route 429 in the suburban community of Sanborn, New York. It was built on of semi-wooded land, with eight interconnected buildings: 

*Ernest Notar Administration (Building A)
*Business (Building B)
*Science (Building C)
*Henrietta G. Lewis Library (Building D)
*Humanities &amp; Social Sciences (Building E)
*Arts &amp; Media (Building F)

<text>Powerball is an American lottery game offered by 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and overseen by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), which also manages other large jackpot games such as the Mega Millions. Drawings are held three times weekly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays at 10:59 p.m. Eastern Time, at the Florida Lottery&#x27;s headquarters in Tallahassee. 

The winning numbers are made up of five &quot;white balls&quot; from a matrix of 69 and one &quot;Powerball&quot; from a matrix of 26, resulting in jackpot odds of 1 in 292,201,338 per play. Each play costs two dollars, but players in some states can add Power Play, which allows players to increase the payout of their winning numbers, or Double Play, which allows players to use their numbers in a second, concurrent drawing with a different prize pool, each for an additional dollar. The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time; some lotteries cut off sales earlier. Powerball&#x27;s minimum jackpot starts at $20 million annuity. Powerball jackpot winners have the choice of taking the annuity or lump sum cash prize. The annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments over 29 years with each annuity payment increasing 5% annually, whereas the lump sum payment, with a cash value of about half of the advertised jackpot, is paid all at once. 

Powerball is known for producing some of the largest lottery jackpots in history, including the record-breaking $2.1 billion jackpot won by a ticket purchased in Altadena, California, in 2022.

==Powerball members==
===Mega Millions and Powerball===
Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah do not have state lotteries.

==History==
=== 1988 precursor: Lotto America ===

Powerball&#x27;s predecessor began in 1988; the multi-state game was known as Lotto America. The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.

Dr. Edward J. Stanek was president of the Iowa Lottery, and along with Steve Caputo, invented the Powerball game.

===1992: Powerball begins===
When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from, offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing low jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and high overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by &quot;The Big Game&quot; (now Mega Millions) in the US, Australia&#x27;s Powerball, Thunderball in the UK, Eurojackpot and EuroMillions.

Through 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines, Iowa. The drawings&#x27; host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went &quot;on the road&quot; for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new &quot;The Big Game&quot;, then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for &quot;both&quot; games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.

On November 2, 1997, the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.

In 1998, Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor Charlie Crist allowed Florida to join MUSL on January 4, 2009.

=== 2001: Introduction of Power Play ===
On March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called &quot;Power Play&quot;) was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the &quot;Power Play&quot; multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the &quot;1x&quot; was removed from the &quot;Power Play&quot; wheel).

===2009: Move to Florida===
With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.

Based on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.

The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando. The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a random number generator (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.

Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009, the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010, it joined Mega Millions (along with New York) years earlier, when &quot;The Big Game&quot; added &quot;Mega Millions&quot; to its name.

===2010: Cross-sell expansion===
In March 2009, it was reported that New Jersey, already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball. In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.

On January 31, 2010, the date of the cross-sell expansion, Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May. The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010. Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20, 2010, Oregon followed on March 28, 2010, Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18, 2010, Maine added Mega Millions on May 9, 2010, Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16, 2010. The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.

Before the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the Sharon, Pennsylvania/Masury, Ohio, border sold both Mega Millions (via the Ohio Lottery) and Powerball (Pennsylvania) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.

Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games&#x27; drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation WGN-TV through its national WGN America feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago&#x27;s Fox owned-and-operated station WFLD in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. (Central Time) newscast, with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery&#x27;s drawings.

On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in Morris Plains. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).

On June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling &quot;either&quot; Mega Millions &quot;or&quot; Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in Sunbury. Ohio&#x27;s second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010, drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.

===2012 format change===
On January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million, with at least a $10 million rollover for each drawing without a jackpot winner. A non-jackpot play matching the five white balls won $1 million. The red balls decreased from 39 to 35. The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery&#x27;s studios in Tallahassee. Sam Arlen began his tenure as host in 2012, while Laura W. Johnson served as Arlen’s co-host.

These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine-figure jackpots; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $500 million jackpot was feasible (it became a reality within the year,) and that the first $1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012 (though it didn&#x27;t occur until 4 years later.) Less than three months after the Powerball changes, Mega Millions&#x27; jackpot reached $656,000,000 despite remaining a $1-per-play game. The random &quot;Power Play&quot; multiplier was retired for a set, fixed dollar amount payout. The $25 million rollover &quot;cap&quot; (creating larger 5+0 prizes) was eliminated.

California joined on April 8, 2013; it has never offered the &quot;Power Play&quot; option, as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games, by law, are parimutuel. Mega Millions, which became available in California in 2005, offers its &quot;Megaplier&quot; in its other 45 jurisdictions.

On January 22, 2014, the variable Power Play option returned (2x-5x) for multiplying non-jackpot prizes.

In October 2014, Puerto Rico joined Powerball; the first mainly Spanish-speaking jurisdiction offering the game; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions.

===2015 format change===
On October 4, 2015, the Powerball format changed again; the white-ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24, it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338. The 4+1 prize became $50,000; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million. Three months later, the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot, double the previous record, after 20 consecutive rollovers.

===2020 COVID-19 adjustments and 2021 provisional removal by Idaho===
On April 2, 2020, the Powerball starting jackpot amount was temporarily reset from $40 million to $20 million with the annuity option, with at least a $2 million rollover for each drawing without a jackpot winner, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This was done to enforce social distancing and discourage crowding of selling venues for large jackpots, and to account for lower interest rates.

On March 10, 2021, following Powerball&#x27;s move to expand its operations in Australia later that year and in the United Kingdom in 2022, the Idaho Legislature voted overwhelmingly to end the state&#x27;s participation in the lottery after more than 30 years. State lawmakers cited fears of outside revenue being generated from the foreign involvement as reasons behind the vote. The removal would have taken place when non-US jurisdictions were allowed to join in August 2021, but was rendered moot when the expansion was put on hold.

=== 2021 addition of Monday drawings and introduction of Double Play ===
On May 23, 2021, Powerball announced that starting on August 23, 2021, draws would occur on Monday, in addition to Wednesday and Saturday. Along with the new Monday drawings, a new Double Play option was added for 12 states (including host state Florida) and Puerto Rico, allowing players to reuse their Powerball numbers in a second drawing (held 30 minutes after the main drawing) for a chance to win a $10 million top prize by paying an extra $1 per game.

Due to technical difficulties that occurred before the start of the new draw schedule, the first ever Monday draw did not occur on its usual time meaning that the first Monday draw did not happen as planned for the group that operates the game. Michele Lyles became the third regular hostess of the Powerball drawings serving alongside Arlen and Johnson. Randy Trainor serves as a substitute host if neither Arlen, Johnson or Lyles are available.

===2022 delay===
The scheduled November 7, 2022, drawing of the record-breaking $2.04B jackpot was delayed due to incomplete security protocols regarding ticket sales at an unnamed lottery until the next day at 8:59 a.m. EST. Prior to the November 7 delay, there had been delays on April 9 and October 19th and on March 16, 2022. Days after the drawing was completed for the $2.04 Billion Powerball Jackpot, the Minnesota Lottery announced later that week that it had been responsible for the delay. Lottery officials there said there was a technical problem with the communication system that prevented the drawing from happening.

== System of the game ==
===Basic game===
The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match one of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (the name for this varies by state, but most are called some variation of &quot;quick pick&quot;, &quot;easy pick&quot;, etc.).

In each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.

Two identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. Originally, the model of machine was the Criterion, manufactured by Beitel Lottery Products (as was the previous Lotto America machines), however since 1999, the model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery was considering switching to a random number generator in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball was affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during Hurricane Michael and again during Hurricane Helene, a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa. The drawings are supervised by Carroll &amp; Company, CPA’s.

The double matrices and probabilities in the game&#x27;s history:
†&quot;Power Play&quot; was introduced in 2001.
‡10× available if jackpot is under $150 million.

While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/70 + 1/25), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.

===Power Play===
For an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.

The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.

Power Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5× spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10×. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10× multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10× space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10× multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10× multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5× guarantee continued; the 10× applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.

Power Play&#x27;s success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably &quot;Megaplier&quot;, available through all Mega Millions members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having &quot;fixed&quot; Power Play prizes.

On January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:
*2× (15)
*3× (9)
*4×/5×: 3 each

On October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43† balls as follows:
*2× (24)
*3× (13)
*4× (3)
*5× (2)
*10× (1)†

† 10× available when jackpot is under $150 million.

===Double Play===

A Double Play option is available in 14 states and Puerto Rico. For an additional $1, players may reuse their Powerball numbers in a second drawing with a different prize structure held approximately 30 minutes after the main drawing. The Double Play top prize is worth $10 million, which stays as a fixed amount in every drawing, even if there&#x27;s no winner. Unlike the main drawing&#x27;s increasing jackpots, the $10 million top prize in Double Play is a not annuitized. Thus, a player is able to receive a cash lump sum worth $10 million, subject to state and federal taxes. A Powerball ticket with the Double Play option costs $3. If both the Power Play and Double Play options are chosen, then the total cost is $4.

===Prizes and odds===

Payouts as of October 7, 2015:

Overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 24.87.

Former prizes/odds (January 19, 2014 – October 3, 2015):

Payouts and odds for Double Play:

Overall odds of winning were 1 in 31.85.
All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts (except in California); they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis, with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier, if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member.

===Jackpot accumulation and payment options===
Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash (in two installments; one from the winning jurisdiction, then the combined funds from the other members) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments. The pre-tax amount of the first annuity payment is approximately 1.505% of the jackpot amount. Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.

The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity. The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non–&quot;Power Play&quot;) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.

MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.

When the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $20 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.

=== Claiming prizes ===
A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).

Generally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include Florida and Missouri; the 60-day &quot;clock&quot; starts with the drawing, so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. New Jersey and Texas require the cash/annuity choice to be made when &quot;playing&quot;; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.

Powerball winnings in California are subject to federal income tax only. Conversely, Powerball winnings in Puerto Rico are not subject to federal income tax, only local tax. There is no state income tax in Florida, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming, and only on interest and dividends in New Hampshire and Tennessee. In all other states, winnings are subject to both federal income tax and that state&#x27;s income tax, provided the winning ticket was purchased in the winner&#x27;s home state. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one&#x27;s home state may be subject to the income tax laws of &quot;both&quot; states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions), though this depends on the states in question.

===Secondary prizes===
Unlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.

Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables. Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.

==Notable wins==
Over time, the size of jackpots has increased because of the higher ticket price, the larger number of states participating, and the reduced odds of winning.

Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.

On December 25, 2002, the president of a construction firm in Putnam County, West Virginia, won $314.9 million ($ million today), then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery. The winner chose the cash option of $170 million, receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings.

On October 19, 2005, a family from Jacksonville, Oregon, won $340 million ($ million today). The winners chose the cash payout of $164.4 million (before withholdings), smaller than a previous winners cash payout in 2002 due to a then-recent change in the annuity structure.

A jackpot of $365 million ($ million today) was won on February 18, 2006, by one ticket in Nebraska. It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant. The group chose the cash option of approximately $177.3 million, before withholdings.

On August 25, 2007, a jackpot worth $314 million ($ million today) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio; that ticket was bought in Richmond, Indiana, a community that had previously sold a jackpot-winning ticket of over $200 million.

In November 2011, three Greenwich, Connecticut, financial executives shared a jackpot of $254.2 million ($ million today), the largest prize on a Connecticut-bought ticket. Choosing the cash option, the men split nearly $104 million after withholdings. The jackpot, at the time, was the 12th largest in Powerball history.

On May 18, 2013, the world&#x27;s largest one-ticket jackpot at the time, an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ($ million today), was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills, Florida. On June 5, Florida Lottery officials announced the winner who purchased the &quot;quick pick&quot; ticket at a Publix supermarket. The winner chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million, before Federal withholding; Florida does not have a state income tax.

On January 13, 2016, the world&#x27;s largest lottery jackpot at the time, an annuity of approximately $1.586 billion was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills, California, Melbourne Beach, Florida, and Munford, Tennessee, each worth $528.8 million. Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee (and California does not tax lottery winnings), the cash option after Federal withholdings is $187.2 million each.

On August 23, 2017, the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee, Massachusetts, won more than $750 million, one of the largest prizes in the lottery&#x27;s history. A mother of two from Massachusetts was the lucky winner.

On March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in Wisconsin was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history. The winner of the enormous prize was identified as a 24-year-old Wisconsin man.

On November 8, 2022, a single ticket purchased in Altadena, California, was the only winner of a $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot, the largest in U.S. lottery history. The prize was claimed on February 14, 2023. The winner was revealed as Edwin Castro. He opted to collect his prize as a lump sum payment of $997.6 million. He purchased his ticket at Joe&#x27;s Service Center in Altadena, which received a $1 million reward from the Powerball operator for selling the winning ticket.

On July 19, 2023, a single ticket purchased in Los Angeles, California, was the only winner of a $1.08 billion ($558.1 million cash) Powerball jackpot.

On October 11, 2023, a single ticket purchased in Frazier Park, California, was the only winner of a $1.76 billion ($774.1 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in U.S lottery history.

=== Fortune cookie payout ===
The Powerball drawing on March 30, 2005, produced 110 second-prize winners. The total payout to these winners was $19.4 million, with 89 winners receiving $100,000 each, while the other 21 winners received $500,000 each as they were Power Play selections.

MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error. However, all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City, New York. The factory had printed the numbers &quot;22, 28, 32, 33, 39, 40&quot; on thousands of fortunes. The &quot;40&quot; in the fortune did not match the Powerball number, 42. No employees of Wonton Food played those numbers. At the time, the closest game member was Connecticut. Because the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play, the payouts were made.

Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number, these winners would have shared the $25 million jackpot: each $227,272 annuity or $122,727 cash (before withholdings). The fortune on the cookie read: &quot;All the preparation you&#x27;ve done will finally be paying off.&quot;

==Computers and slot machines==
In 2006, WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name. In 2007, the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real-time. The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements.

The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010. Five winning numbers plus a Powerball were printed across the top of the card, with 12 opportunities to match. Matching the winning numbers or the Powerball won. The top prize was $1 million (annuity); unlike actual Powerball, there was no cash option for the top prize.

<text>Francis Russell &quot;Frank&quot; O&#x27;Hara (March 27, 1926 – July 25, 1966) was an American writer, poet, and art critic. A curator at the Museum of Modern Art, O&#x27;Hara became prominent in New York City&#x27;s art world. O&#x27;Hara is regarded as a leading figure in the New York School, an informal group of artists, writers, and musicians who drew inspiration from jazz, surrealism, abstract expressionism, action painting, and contemporary avant-garde art movements.

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poetry is personal in tone and content, and has been described as sounding &quot;like entries in a diary&quot;. Poet and critic Mark Doty has said O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poetry is &quot;urbane, ironic, sometimes genuinely celebratory and often wildly funny&quot; containing &quot;material and associations alien to academic verse&quot; such as &quot;the camp icons of movie stars of the twenties and thirties, the daily landscape of social activity in Manhattan, jazz music, telephone calls from friends&quot;. O&#x27;Hara sought to capture in his poetry the immediacy of life, feeling that poetry should be &quot;between two persons instead of two pages.&quot;

&quot;The Collected Poems of Frank O&#x27;Hara&quot; edited by Donald Allen (Knopf, 1971), the first of several posthumous collections, shared the 1972 National Book Award for Poetry. Brad Gooch&#x27;s &quot;City Poet&quot; is the first substantial biography on O&#x27;Hara.

==Early life and education==
Frank O&#x27;Hara, the son of Russell Joseph O&#x27;Hara and Katherine (née Broderick), was born on March 27, 1926, at Maryland General Hospital, Baltimore and grew up in Grafton, Massachusetts. He attended St. John&#x27;s High School. He grew up believing his birthday was in June, when, in fact, he had been born in March—as his parents disguised his true date of birth because he had been conceived out of wedlock. He studied piano at the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1941 to 1944 and served in the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific and Japan as a sonarman on the destroyer USS &quot;Nicholas&quot; during World War II.

With the funding made available to veterans he attended Harvard University, where artist and writer Edward Gorey was his roommate. O&#x27;Hara was heavily influenced by visual art and by contemporary music, which was his first love (he remained a fine piano player all his life and would shock new partners by suddenly playing music by Sergei Rachmaninoff when visiting them). His favorite poets were Pierre Reverdy, Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, Boris Pasternak, and Vladimir Mayakovsky. While at Harvard, O&#x27;Hara met John Ashbery and began publishing poems in the &quot;Harvard Advocate.&quot; Despite his love of music, O&#x27;Hara changed his major and graduated from Harvard in 1950 with a degree in English.

He then attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he won a Hopwood Award and, in 1951, received a master&#x27;s degree in English.

== Early career ==
In the autumn of 1951, O&#x27;Hara moved into an apartment in New York City with Joe LeSueur, who was his roommate and sometime lover for the next 11 years. It was during this time that he began teaching at The New School.

O&#x27;Hara was active in the art world, working as a reviewer for &quot;ARTnews&quot;, and in 1960 was assistant curator of painting and sculpture exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art. He was a friend of the artists Norman Bluhm, Mike Goldberg, Grace Hartigan, Alex Katz, Willem de Kooning, Joan Mitchell, and Larry Rivers.

==Poetry==
While O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poetry is generally autobiographical, it tends to make observations about his life in New York, rather than exploring his past. In his introduction to &quot;The Collected Poems of Frank O&#x27;Hara&quot;, Donald Allen says, &quot;that Frank O&#x27;Hara tended to think of his poems as a record of his life is apparent in much of his work.&quot; O&#x27;Hara discussed this aspect of his poetry in a statement for Donald Allen&#x27;s &quot;The New American Poetry&quot;:

What is happening to me, allowing for lies and exaggerations which I try to avoid, goes into my poems. I don&#x27;t think my experiences are clarified or made beautiful for myself or anyone else, they are just there in whatever form I can find them. . .My formal &quot;stance&quot; is found at the crossroads where what I know and can&#x27;t get meets what is left of that I know and can bear without hatred. . .It may be that poetry makes life&#x27;s nebulous events tangible to me and restores their detail; or conversely that poetry brings forth the intangible quality of incidents which are all too concrete and circumstantial. Or each on specific occasions, or both all the time.

His initial time in the Navy, during his basic training at Sampson Naval Training Center, in upstate New York, along with earlier years at St. John&#x27;s High School, began to shape a distinguished style of solitary observation that would later inform his poems. Immersion in regimented daily routine, first at Catholic school, then in the Navy, enabled him to separate himself from situations and make witty, often singularly perceptive commentary. Sometimes he cataloged it for use in later writing, or, perhaps more often, put it into letters. This skill at scrutinizing and recording amid the bustle and churn of daily life would later be one of the important aspects that shaped O&#x27;Hara as an urban poet, writing off the cuff.

Among his friends, O&#x27;Hara was known to treat poetry dismissively, as something to be done only in the moment. John Ashbery says he witnessed O&#x27;Hara &quot;Dashing poems off at odd moments—in his office at the Museum of Modern Art, in the street at lunchtime, or even in a room full of people—he would then put them away in drawers and cartons and half forget them.&quot;

In the summer of 1951, O&#x27;Hara read a manifesto in &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; written by the poet, novelist and anarchistic social critic Paul Goodman. In the essay, Goodman argues that the postwar American &quot;advanced guard&quot; writers must articulate the deep-seated, personal disquiet felt across the culture but left unvoiced. The essay encouraged O&#x27;Hara to write poetry that was embarrassing in its directness, and even seen as hostile to literary standards then in place. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poetry began to erase poetry&#x27;s cautious border between what is public and what is private.

In 1959, he wrote a mock manifesto (originally published in the magazine &quot;Yūgen&quot; in 1961) called &quot;Personism: A Manifesto&quot;, in which he explains his position on formal structure: &quot;I don&#x27;t ... like rhythm, assonance, all that stuff. You just go on your nerve. If someone&#x27;s chasing you down the street with a knife you just run, you don&#x27;t turn around and shout, &#x27;Give it up! I was a track star for Mineola Prep.&#x27;&quot; He says, in response to academic overemphasis on form, &quot;As for measure and other technical apparatus, that&#x27;s just common sense: if you&#x27;re going to buy a pair of pants you want them to be tight enough so everyone will want to go to bed with you. There&#x27;s nothing metaphysical about it.&quot; He claims that on August 27, 1959, while talking to LeRoi Jones, he founded a movement called Personism which may be &quot;the death of literature as we know it.&quot;

He says,

It does not have to do with personality or intimacy, far from it! But to give you a vague idea, one of its minimal aspects is to address itself to one person (other than the poet himself), thus evoking overtones of love without destroying love&#x27;s life-giving vulgarity, and sustaining the poet&#x27;s feelings toward the poem while preventing love from distracting him into feeling about the person.

His poetry shows the influence of abstract expressionism, surrealism, Russian poetry, and poets associated with French symbolism. Ashbery says, &quot;The poetry that meant the most to him when he began writing was either French – Rimbaud, Mallarmé, the Surrealists: poets who speak the language of every day into the reader&#x27;s dream – or Russian – Pasternak and especially Mayakovsky, for whom he picked up what James Schuyler has called the &#x27;intimate yell.&#x27;&quot; As part of the New York School of poetry, O&#x27;Hara to some degree encapsulated the compositional philosophy of New York School painters.

Ashbery says, &quot;Frank O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s concept of the poem as the chronicle of the creative act that produces it was strengthened by his intimate experience of Pollock&#x27;s, Kline&#x27;s, and de Kooning&#x27;s great paintings of the late &#x27;40s and early &#x27;50s and of the imaginative realism of painters like Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers.&quot;

O&#x27;Hara was also influenced by William Carlos Williams, so much so that he lists Williams (along with Hart Crane and Walt Whitman) as one of three poets who were &quot;better than the movies.&quot; According to Marjorie Perloff in her book &quot;Frank O&#x27;Hara, Poet among Painters&quot;, he and Williams both use everyday language and simple statements split at irregular intervals. Perloff points out the similarities between O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s &quot;Autobiographia Literaria&quot; and Williams&#x27;s &quot;Invocation and Conclusion&quot;. At the end of &quot;Autobiographia Literaria&quot;, the speaker says, &quot;And here I am, the/center of all beauty!/writing these poems!/Imagine!&quot; Similarly, Williams at the end of &quot;Invocation and Conclusion&quot; says, &quot;Now look at me!&quot; These lines show a shared interest in the self as an individual who can only be himself in isolation. A similar idea is expressed in a line from Williams&#x27;s &quot;Danse Russe&quot;: &quot;Who shall say I am not/ the happy genius of my household?&quot;

==Personal life==

Frank O&#x27;Hara, who was gay, met Joe LeSueur in 1951, and the two maintained a relationship until 1965, living together on and off from 1955 to 1965.

From 1959 to 1963, the two lived at 441 East 9th Street in the East Village. Known throughout his life for his extreme sociability, passion, and warmth, O&#x27;Hara had hundreds of friends and lovers throughout his life, many from the New York art and poetry worlds. Soon after arriving in New York, he was employed at the Museum of Modern Art, selling postcards at the admissions desk, and began to write seriously.

O&#x27;Hara met longtime partner Vincent Warren in the summer of 1959. Warren, a Canadian ballet dancer, was the inspiration for several of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poems, including &quot;Poem (A la Recherche d&#x27;Gertrude Stein)&quot;, &quot;Les Luths&quot;, &quot;Poem (So many echoes in my head)&quot;, and &quot;Having a Coke With You&quot;. Warren died on October 25, 2017, 51 years after O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s death.

==Death==

In the early morning hours of July 24, 1966, O&#x27;Hara was struck by a jeep on the Fire Island beach, after the beach taxi in which he had been riding with a group of friends broke down in the dark. He died the next day at age 40 of a ruptured liver at Bayview Hospital in Mastic Beach, Long Island. Attempts to bring negligent homicide charges against the jeep&#x27;s driver, 23-year-old Kenneth L. Ruzicka, were unsuccessful; many of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s friends felt the local police had conducted a lax investigation to protect one of their own locals. O&#x27;Hara was buried in Green River Cemetery on Long Island. The painter Larry Rivers, a longtime friend and lover, delivered one of the eulogies, along with Bill Berkson, Edwin Denby, and René d&#x27;Harnoncourt.

==In popular culture==

===In music===
Morton Feldman composed &quot;For Frank O&#x27;Hara&quot; (1973) for 7 instrumentalists. 

In First Aid Kit&#x27;s song &quot;To A Poet&quot;, there is the lyric, &quot;But Frank put it best when he said &#x27;you can&#x27;t plan on the heart&#x27;&quot;, a reference to O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem, &quot;My Heart&quot;.

In Martha&#x27;s song &quot;1967, I Miss You, I&#x27;m Lonely&quot;, the lyric, &quot;I look at you and I am confident that I&#x27;d rather look at you than all the portraits in existence in the world, except possibly O&#x27;Hara by Grace Hartigan,&quot; references both O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem, &quot;Having a Coke With You&quot;, and Grace Hartigan&#x27;s portrait of O&#x27;Hara.

Rilo Kiley&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;More Adventurous&quot; is titled after a line in O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem &quot;Meditations in an Emergency&quot;: &quot;Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous...&quot; The title track references the same line: &quot;I read with every broken heart, we should become more adventurous&quot;

Frankie Cosmos&#x27;s music is influenced by O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s works, visible in two of her albums, &quot;Zentropy&quot; and &quot;Next Thing&quot;. Greta Kline has stated that her stage name derived from the poet.

The song Frank O&#x27;Hara by the band Sea Wolf (band) describes a relationship with the Poet.

===In film===
In the 2011 film &quot;Beastly&quot;, the lovestruck main characters read O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem &quot;Having a Coke with You&quot; aloud to each other.

===In literature===
O&#x27;Hara is a minor character in William Boyd&#x27;s 2002 novel&quot; Any Human Heart.&quot;

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s &quot;Lunch Poems&quot; is the basis of Paul Legault&#x27;s &quot;Lunch Poems 2&quot;.

===In television===
In the season 1 episode of the HBO series &quot;Bored to Death&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Missing Screenplay&quot;, the main character loses a screenplay written by Jim Jarmusch about the life of Frank O&#x27;Hara.

In the last episode of the series &quot;Normal People&quot;, based on Sally Rooney&#x27;s novel of the same name, Connell&#x27;s gift for Marianne&#x27;s birthday is said to be a Frank O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s collection of poetry.

Several episodes of &quot;Mad Men&quot; (season 2) reference O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s collection of poetry, &quot;Meditations in an Emergency&quot;. The first episode shows a character reading from it over lunch in a bar (recalling O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s 1964 collection &quot;Lunch Poems&quot;) as does the last episode, which uses the book&#x27;s title as its episode title. In the twelfth episode, Don Draper finds his copy of &quot;Meditations in an Emergency&quot; in Anna Draper&#x27;s home in California.

===In plays===
The poetry of Frank O&#x27;Hara features prominently in Rachel Bonds&#x27;s 2017 play &quot;At the Old Place&quot;.

===Landmarks===
On June 10, 2014, a plaque was unveiled outside one of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s New York City residences, at 441 East Ninth Street. Poets Tony Towle, who inherited the apartment from O&#x27;Hara, and Edmund Berrigan read his works at the event.

<text>A pillow fight is a common game mostly played by young children (but also by teens and adults) in which they engage in mock physical conflict, using pillows as weapons.

Pillow fights often occur during children&#x27;s sleepovers. Since pillows are usually soft, injuries rarely occur. The heft of a pillow can still knock a young person off balance, especially on a soft surface such as a bed, which is a common venue. In earlier eras, pillows would often break, shedding feathers throughout a room. Modern pillows tend to be stronger and are often filled with a solid block of artificial filling, so breakage occurs far less frequently.

== Organized pillow fights ==
Pillow fighting has become a part of flash mob culture, with pillow fight flash mobs popping up in cities around the world. Social media is frequently used to initiate and advertise public pillow fight events.

World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), occasionally staged &quot;pillow fight matches&quot; between female wrestlers, then known as Divas, during the early 2000s. These were often booked as Lingerie Pillow Fights, in which women &quot;compete&quot; in lingerie or pajamas, with little or no actual wrestling taking place. The final match of this type was held in 2008.

In January 2007, Reuters reported on a Pillow Fight League that was operating in bars in Toronto. Pre-selected female &quot;fighters&quot; with stage personalities were paid small amounts to stage regular, unscripted fights. The rules called for &quot;no lewd behavior, and moves such as leg drops or tickling or submission holds are allowed as long as a pillow is used.&quot; The league ceased operations in 2011, and a crowdfunding campaign created to facilitate its return was unsuccessful.

March 22, 2008, was the first World Pillow Fight Day, a day organized in the United States by Newmindspace, a group created by two University of Toronto students. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; estimated that 5,000 people participated in a New York event coinciding with the day.

The Guinness World Record for the largest pillow fight was set in July 2015 at a St. Paul Saints baseball game, where 6,261 participated in an event sponsored by local manufacturer My Pillow. The record was later broken in May 2018 at an evangelical Christian concert. 7,861 people participated in the Minneapolis, Minnesota event, which was also sponsored by My Pillow.

September 25, 2021, Gladiatrix LLC, DBA FightPFC.com, Pillow Fight Championships, live streamed their second full card professional pillow fight event. The company announced plans to expand the franchise internationally and to develop pillow fighting as a national sport with standardized rules scoring and equipment. Real pillow fights between real fighters with real cash prizes at stake. Sports Writer Joe Capozzi reported the event as a &quot;Fierce but wholesome combat sport&quot;.

October 5, 2021, NYPost reports that MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighters were enjoying the new sport of professional pillow fighting.

== In Japan ==
In Makura-Nage, a Japanese pillow fight variation, players throw pillows instead of swinging them.

==In film==

Pillow fights were a popular theme in early cinematography. 1897 saw the release of &quot;A Pillow Fight&quot; by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company followed by &quot;Pillow Fight&quot; from Edison Studios. In the same year Siegmund Lubin released &quot;New Pillow Fight&quot;. Lubin returned to the subject in 1903 with the film &quot;Pillow Fight, Reversed&quot;.

Other films to portray pillow fights include &quot;Animal House&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, and &quot;The Room&quot;.

<text>Robert George Brian Dickson (May 25, 1916 – October 17, 1998) was a Canadian lawyer, military officer and judge who served as the 15th chief justice of Canada from 1984 to 1990 and as a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1973 to 1984. He retired on June 30, 1990.

Dickson&#x27;s tenure as chief justice coincided with the first wave of cases under the new &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; which, established in 1982, reached the Supreme Court from 1984 onwards. Dickson wrote several very influential judgments dealing with the &quot;Charter&quot; and laid the groundwork for the approach that the courts would take to the &quot;Charter&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Dickson was born to Thomas Dickson and Sarah Elizabeth Gibson, in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, in 1916, although the family lived at that time in Wynyard. His adolescence and young adulthood occurred during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl years, which hit the Canadian prairies particularly hard.

Dickson&#x27;s father was a bank manager, and the family was eventually transferred to Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. Dickson attended high school at the Central Collegiate, where two of his classmates were William Lederman and Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; MacPherson. All three would go into law, with Lederman becoming one of Canada&#x27;s leading constitutional scholars and MacPherson becoming a justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench. In later years, Dickson would reminisce that &quot;Bill was always first in our class, and Sandy and I were fighting for second and third&quot;.

Sandy MacPherson&#x27;s father was M. A. MacPherson, the attorney general for Saskatchewan. When the legislature was sitting in the evenings, Dickson and Sandy MacPherson would come in the evenings to the Attorney General&#x27;s office to do their homework, and then sit in the galleries of the Assembly and listen to the debates. Dickson said that his interest in the law was triggered by that experience.

The Dickson family later moved to Winnipeg, where Dickson attended the University of Manitoba after graduating from Ridley College in 1934. He was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity. In 1938, Dickson graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, earning the gold medal for his class. His first permanent job was with the Great-West Life Assurance Company, where he worked in the investment section for two years.

It was in Winnipeg as a young law student that Dickson met his future wife, Barbara Sellers. They married in Winnipeg in 1943, when Dickson was back from Europe to attend military staff training in Kingston.

==Military career==
Dickson was called to the bar in 1940, but before practising law, he enlisted in the Canadian armed forces for active service. He had joined the military reserve in 1939, on the outbreak of World War II. In June 1940, he and his friend from law school, Clarence Shepard, signed up for active duty as second lieutenants with the Royal Canadian Artillery, joining the 38th Field Battery in Winnipeg. In August 1940, he volunteered for overseas service.

Lieutenant Dickson sailed in February 1941 for Britain with the 3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. His abilities attracted notice and he was chosen for staff training, returning to Canada for a course in 1943, followed with a tour of duty in British Columbia as brigade major with the Royal Canadian Artillery. In 1944, Dickson volunteered to return to Europe as a captain. He was posted to the 2nd Canadian Army Group, Royal Canadian Artillery, and distinguished himself in Normandy, being mentioned in dispatches.

In August 1944, during the battle of Falaise Gap, Dickson was hit by friendly fire and severely wounded, leading to the amputation of his right leg. By coincidence, two of his friends, Bill Lederman and Clarence Shepard, were both serving in the area and witnessed the attack. They later remembered the frantic attempts to have the attack called off, not knowing at the time Dickson was in the target area. He was discharged from the army in April 1945.

Years later, when he came to Ottawa, Dickson renewed his ties to the military. In 1983, he accepted the honorary lieutenant-colonelship of the 30th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, and was its honorary colonel from 1988 to 1992.

==Legal career==
Dickson returned to Winnipeg in 1945 at the end of the war, joining the law firm of Aikins, Loftus, MacAulay, Turner, Thompson &amp; Tritschler. He became a successful corporate lawyer, and also lectured at the Faculty of Law of the University of Manitoba for six years, until 1954. In 1963, he was on a volunteer committee of the Canadian Bar Association (&quot;CBA&quot;) which assisted the Manitoba government in preparing a new &quot;Companies Act&quot;. Two other volunteers on the committee were Lorne Campbell and Irwin Dorfman, both of whom would later serve as national president of the CBA.

==Community involvement==
In 1950, Dickson volunteered to be head of the Manitoba Red Cross, on the suggestion of a partner who told him it would only involve a few meetings per year. Instead, Dickson took the position just in time for the 1950 Red River flood, with the Red reaching the highest level since 1861. Winnipeg itself was inundated, 4 of 11 bridges were destroyed, and over 100,000 people had to be evacuated. Dickson took charge of the relief effort by the Red Cross, not seeing his law office for six weeks. Under his direction, the Red Cross mobilised 4,000 volunteers, evacuated thousands and provided support to the people working on the dykes. He later admitted he ran the Red Cross volunteers like an army.

Dickson also served as chancellor (legal advisor) for the Anglican Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land.

==Judicial career==
In 1963, Dickson was appointed to the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba and in 1967 was elevated to the Manitoba Court of Appeal. He was appointed a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada on March 26, 1973. On April 18, 1984, he was elevated to chief justice of Canada over the more senior Roland Ritchie, who was one year away from mandatory retirement at age 75 and was in ill health.

During his early years on the Supreme Court, Dickson frequently joined with Justice Laskin and Justice Spence on cases involving civil liberties, often in dissent from the more conservative majority on the Court. The grouping was colloquially referred to as the &quot;LSD connection&quot;.

Having come from a corporate law background, Dickson often contributed to the judgments in that field. He also developed a reputation as an important authority on constitutional law, originally relating to law of Canadian federalism and later, the groundwork for the new &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

Dickson participated in the 1981 &quot;Patriation Reference&quot;, which considered Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s attempt to have the federal government unilaterally patriate the Constitution of Canada without the consent of the provinces. By a 7–2 division, a majority of the Court held that Parliament had the legal authority to act unilaterally. However, by a division of 6–3, the Court also held that unilateral federal action would violate a constitutional convention that had emerged since Confederation, requiring substantial provincial agreement on constitutional amendments. Dickson, along with the three judges from Quebec, was in the majority on both issues: he agreed that Parliament had the legal authority to act unilaterally, but also agreed that a constitutional convention required a substantive degree of provincial agreement for major constitutional amendments.

With the introduction of the &quot;Charter&quot; in 1982, Dickson made many major contributions to the early standards of interpretation. Among his most famous decisions was that of &quot;R v Oakes&quot;, where he proposed the analytical framework for section 1 of the Charter now known as the &quot;&quot;Oakes&quot; test&quot;. In &quot;R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd&quot;, he gave a broad interpretation to the guarantee of freedom of religion set out in section 2 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, and in &quot;R v Morgentaler&quot;, he found that the restrictions on abortions set out in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; violated a woman&#x27;s security of person, contrary to section 7 of the &quot;Charter&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Dickson served on the Supreme Court for 17 years before retiring on June 30, 1990. He died on October 17, 1998, at age 82.

==Honours==
In 1990, Dickson was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In addition to his military service and his ground-breaking judgments on the &quot;Charter&quot;, the citation mentions his Red Cross volunteerism and service in other humanitarian causes.

The Brian Dickson Law Library at the University of Ottawa is named for him. The library&#x27;s reading room contains a full reproduction of his home office, artifacts and personal items representing his life.

<doc id="530104" wikidata="Q247036" url="?curid=530104" title="Yokosuka D4Y">
<text>The is a two-seat carrier-based dive bomber developed by the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1942 to 1945 during World War II. Development of the aircraft began in 1938. The first D4Y1 was complete in November 1940 and made its maiden flight at Yokosuka the following month.

While the aircraft was originally conceived as a dive bomber, the D4Y was used in other roles including reconnaissance, night fighter and special attack (kamikaze). It made its combat debut as a reconnaissance aircraft when two pre-production D4Y1-Cs embarked aboard the &quot;Sōryū&quot; to take part in the Battle of Midway in 1942. It was not until March 1943 that it was accepted for use as a dive bomber. The early D4Y1 and D4Y2 featured the liquid-cooled Aichi Atsuta engine, a licensed version of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601, while the later D4Y3 and D4Y4 featured the Mitsubishi MK8P Kinsei radial engine.

Like many other Japanese aircraft of the time, the D4Y lacked armor and self-sealing fuel tanks and it was not until the final variant, the D4Y4, that the aircraft was given bulletproof glass and armor protection for the crew and fuel tanks. Nevertheless, the D4Y was one of the fastest dive bombers of the war, particularly the D4Y4 which Max Gadney said was the &quot;fastest dive-bomber of World War II&quot; and that it was &quot;faster than the Zero&quot;. Only the delays in its development hindered its service while its predecessor, the slower fixed-gear Aichi D3A, remained in service much longer than intended. In October 1944, an attack by a lone D4Y resulted in the sinking of light carrier USS &quot;Princeton&quot; in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Similarly in March 1945, a single D4Y managed to hit the carrier USS &quot;Franklin&quot; with two bombs, nearly sinking &quot;Franklin&quot; and resulting in the loss of almost 800 of her crew. Famously, a D4Y was used in one of the final kamikaze attacks in 1945, hours after the surrender of Japan, with Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki in the rear cockpit. 

==Design and development==
Development of the aircraft began in 1938 at the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal when the Imperial Japanese Navy Aviation Bureau (&quot;Kaigun Kōkū Hombu&quot;) issued requirements of a Navy Experimental 13-Shi Carrier Borne specification for an aircraft carrier-based dive bomber to replace the Aichi D3A. Its design was inspired by the Heinkel He 118 which the Japanese Navy had acquired from Germany in early 1938. The aircraft was a single-engine, all-metal low-wing monoplane, with a wide-track retractable undercarriage and wing-mounted dive brakes. It had a crew of two: a pilot and a navigator/radio-operator/gunner, seated under a long, glazed canopy which provided good all-round visibility. The pilot of bomber versions was provided with a telescopic bombsight. The aircraft was powered by an Aichi Atsuta liquid-cooled inverted V12 engine, a licensed copy of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601, rated at 895 kW (1,200 hp). The radiator was behind and below the three-blade propeller, as in the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk.

The aircraft had a slim fuselage that enabled it to reach high speeds in horizontal flight and in dives, while it had excellent maneuverability despite high wing loading, with the &quot;Suisei&quot; having superior performance to contemporary dive bombers such as the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. In order to conform with the Japanese Navy&#x27;s requirement for long range, weight was minimized by not fitting the D4Y with self-sealing fuel tanks or armour. Subsequently, the D4Y was extremely vulnerable and tended to catch fire when hit.

Bombs were fitted under the wings and in an internal fuselage bomb bay. It usually carried one 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb but there were reports that the D4Y sometimes carried two 250 kg (550 lb) bombs.} The aircraft was armed with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 97 aircraft machine guns in the nose and a 7.92 mm (.312 in) Type 1 machine gun – selected for its high rate of fire – in the rear of the cockpit. The rear gun was replaced by a 13 mm (.51 in) Type 2 machine gun. This armament was typical for Japanese carrier-based dive-bombers, unlike &quot;carrier attack bombers&quot; (torpedo bombers) like the Nakajima B5N and B6N, which were not given forward-firing armament until the late-war Aichi B7A, which was expected to serve as both a dive-bomber and torpedo-bomber and was given a pair of 20mm Type 99-2 cannon. The forward machine guns were retained in the &quot;kamikaze&quot; version.

The first (of five) prototypes was complete in November 1940 and made its maiden flight in December 1940. After the prototype trials, problems with flutter were encountered, a fatal flaw for an airframe subject to the stresses of dive bombing. Until this could be resolved, early production aircraft were used as reconnaissance aircraft, as the D4Y1-C, which took advantage of its high speed and long range while not over-stressing the airframe. Production of the D4Y1-C continued in small numbers until March 1943, when the increasing losses incurred by the D3A resulted in production switching to the D4Y1 dive-bomber, the aircraft&#x27;s structural problems finally being solved. Although the D4Y could operate from the large fleet carriers that formed the core of the Combined Fleet at the start of the war, it had problems operating from the smaller and slower carriers such as the &quot;Hiyō&quot; class, which formed a large proportion of Japan&#x27;s carrier fleet after the losses of the Battle of Midway. Catapult equipment was fitted, giving rise to the D4Y1 &quot;Kai&quot; (or improved) model.
Early versions of the D4Y were difficult to keep operational because the Atsuta engines were unreliable in front-line service. From the beginning, some had argued that the D4Y should be powered by an air-cooled radial engine, which Japanese engineers and maintenance crew had experience with and trusted. The aircraft was re-engined with the reliable Mitsubishi MK8P &quot;Kinsei&quot; 62, a 14-cylinder, two-row radial engine as the Yokosuka D4Y3 Model 33.

Although the new engine improved ceiling and rate of climb to over and climb to in 4.5 minutes instead of and 5 minutes, the higher fuel consumption resulted in reduced range and cruising speed, and the engine obstructed the forward and downward view of the pilot, hampering carrier operations. These problems were tolerated because of the increased availability of the new variant.

The last version was the D4Y4 Special Strike Bomber, a single-seat &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft, capable of carrying one bomb, which was put into production in February 1945. It was equipped with three rocket boosters for terminal dive acceleration. This aircraft was an almost ideal &quot;kamikaze&quot; model: it had a combination of speed (560 km/h/350 mph), range (2,500 km/1,550 mi) and payload (800 kg/1,760 lb) probably not matched by any other Japanese aircraft.

The D4Y5 Model 54 was a planned version designed in 1945. It was to be powered by the Nakajima NK9C &quot;Homare&quot; 12 radial engine rated at 1,361 kW (1,825 hp), a new four-blade metal propeller of the constant-speed type and more armour for the crew and fuel tanks. 

Ultimately, 2,038 of all variants were produced, mostly by Aichi Kokuki.

==Operational history==
Lacking armor and self-sealing fuel tanks, the &quot;Suiseis&quot; did not fare well against Allied fighters. They did, however, cause considerable damage to ships, including the carrier which was nearly sunk by an assumed single D4Y and the light carrier which was sunk by a single D4Y.

The D4Y was operated from the following Japanese aircraft carriers: , , , , , , , , , and .

The D4Y1-C reconnaissance aircraft entered service in mid-1942, when two of these aircraft were deployed aboard &quot;Sōryū&quot; at the Battle of Midway, one of which was lost when &quot;Sōryū&quot; was bombed. The other had been launched on a scouting mission and returned to &quot;Hiryū&quot;; it was then lost when &quot;Hiryū&quot; was bombed.

===Marianas===
During the Battle of the Marianas, the D4Ys were engaged by U.S. Navy fighters and shot down in large numbers. It was faster than the Grumman F4F Wildcat, but not the new Grumman F6F Hellcat, which entered combat in September 1943. The Japanese aircraft were adequate for 1943, but the rapid advances in American materiel in 1944 (among them, the introduction in large numbers of the &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carrier) left the Japanese behind. Another disadvantage suffered by the Japanese was their inexperienced pilots.

The U.S. Task Force 58 struck the Philippine airfields and destroyed the land air forces first before engaging Japanese naval aircraft. The result was what the Americans called &quot;The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, with 400 Japanese aircraft shot down in a single day. A single Hellcat pilot, Lieutenant Alexander Vraciu, shot down six D4Ys within a few minutes.

One D4Y was said to have damaged the battleship .

===Leyte and Philippines===

The D4Y was relegated to land operations where both the liquid-cooled engine D4Y2, and the radial engine D4Y3 fought against the U.S. fleet, scoring some successes. An unseen D4Y bombed and sank the &quot;Princeton&quot; on 24 October 1944. D4Ys hit other carriers as well, by both conventional attacks and &quot;kamikaze&quot; actions. In the Philippines air battles, the Japanese used &quot;kamikazes&quot; for the first time, and they scored heavily. D4Ys from 761 &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; may have hit the escort carrier on 25 October 1944, and the next day, . Both were badly damaged, especially &quot;Suwannee&quot;, with heavy casualties and many aircraft destroyed. A month later on 25 November, , , and were hit by &quot;kamikazes&quot;, almost exclusively A6M Zero fighters and D4Ys, with much more damage. D4Ys also made conventional attacks. All these D4Ys were from 601 and 653 &quot;Kōkūtai&quot;.

===In defense of the homeland===
Task Force 58 approached southern Japan in March 1945 to strike military objectives in support of the invasion of Okinawa. The Japanese responded with massive &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, codenamed &quot;Kikusui&quot;, in which many D4Ys were used. A dedicated &quot;kamikaze&quot; version of the D4Y3, the D4Y4, with a non-detachable 800 kg bomb attached in a semi-recessed manner, was developed. The Japanese had begun installing rocket boosters on some Kamikazes, including the D4Y4, in order to increase speed near the target. As the D4Y4 was virtually identical in the air to the D4Y3, it was difficult to determine the sorties of each type.

The carriers and were damaged by D4Ys of 701 Wing on 18 March. On 19 March, the carrier was hit with two bombs from a single D4Y. &quot;Franklin&quot; was so heavily damaged that she was retired until the end of the war. Another D4Y hit the carrier .

On 12 April 1945, another D4Y, part of &quot;Kikusui&quot; mission N.2, struck &quot;Enterprise&quot;, causing some damage.

During &quot;Kikusui&quot; N.6, on 11 May 1945, was hit and put out of action by two &quot;kamikazes&quot; that some sources identify as D4Ys. This was the third &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier forced to retire to the United States to repair.

===Night fighter===
The D4Y was faster than the A6M Zero, and some were employed as D4Y2-S night fighters against Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers late in the War. The night fighter conversions were made at the 11th Naval Aviation Arsenal at Hiro. Each D4Y2-S had its bombing systems and equipment removed and replaced by a 20 mm Type 99 cannon installed in the rear cockpit, with the barrel slanted up and forwards in a similar manner to the German &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; armament fitting (pioneered by the IJNAS in May 1943 on the Nakajima J1N). Some examples also carried two or four 10 cm air-to-air rockets under the wings; lack of radar for night interceptions, inadequate climb rate and the B-29&#x27;s high ceiling limited the D4Y2-S effectiveness as a night fighter. Little is known of their operations.

===Last action===
At the end of the War, D4Ys were still being used operationally against the U.S. Navy. Among the last of these were eleven aircraft led by Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki on a suicide mission on 15 August 1945, of which all but three were lost.

An engineless D4Y3 was recovered from Babo Airfield, Indonesia in 1991. It was acquired and restored to non-flying status by the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California. It was restored to represent a radial engined D4Y3, using an American Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 engine. The engine is in running condition and can be started to demonstrate ground running and taxiing of the aircraft.

<text>Kryptonians are a fictional extraterrestrial race within the DC Comics universe that originated on the planet Krypton. The term originated from the stories of DC Comics superhero, Superman. The stories also use &quot;Kryptonian&quot; as an adjective to refer to anything created by or associated with the planet itself or the cultures that existed on it.

Members of a dominant sentient species of the planet Krypton are indistinguishable from Terran humans in terms of their appearance in their physiology and genetics, but they are vastly different. In some continuities Kryptonians are difficult to clone because their DNA is so complex that human science is not advanced enough to decipher it. The cellular structure of Kryptonians allows for solar energy to be absorbed at extremely high levels. On the planet Krypton, which orbited a red star, their natural abilities were the same as humans. When exposed to a young yellow star like Earth&#x27;s Sun, which is much smaller than their own sun and with a vastly higher energy output, their bodies are able to absorb and process so much energy that it manifests as vast superhuman powers (such as superhuman strength, superhuman speed, invulnerability, flight, x-ray vision, heat vision and superhuman senses).

Almost all Kryptonians were killed when the planet exploded shortly after the infant Kal-El was sent to Earth. In some continuities, he is the planet&#x27;s only survivor. In other versions of canon, there is a last daughter of Krypton Kara Zor-El, cousin of Superman and known as Supergirl. Krypto was the family dog in Jor-El&#x27;s home and was used for a test flight of the rocket that ultimately brought baby Kal-El to Earth. These three were the surviving Kryptonians, who became Earth&#x27;s heroes.

==Physiology and powers==
Kal-El can lead an alter ego as Clark Kent because Kryptonians appear identical to humans. Also, in both Silver Age and Modern Age continuity, Kryptonians have more than one ethnic group, such as dark-skinned Kryptonians from Krypton&#x27;s Vathlo Island that resemble Earth humans of West African, Negrito, Melanesian, and Indigenous Australian descent and a group from the continent of Twenx that resemble Earth humans of North African, Middle Eastern, Asian, Micronesian, Polynesian, Native American, and Latino descent. This is all due to convergent evolution. In the first stories about Superman&#x27;s origins, all Kryptonians possess on their homeworld the same powers Superman has on Earth. In later depictions, their abilities are attributed to the differences between Earth&#x27;s gravity and that of Krypton and the different radiation of the stars they orbit. Kryptonians use solar energy from yellow, blue, orange or white stars on the cellular and molecular levels to gain superhuman abilities. The light of dwarf stars, pulsars, and quasars also grants Kryptonians different abilities. Some stories also maintain that Kryptonians have bioelectric fields that surround their bodies and protect them from harm and which are the means by which Kryptonians fly. Certain individuals (including Conner Kent, Chris Kent, and some Phantom Zone criminals) have sometimes been depicted with &quot;tactile telekinesis&quot;, which allows Kryptonians to lift and manipulate large objects whose own structural strength might not otherwise survive the process. The abilities of Kryptonians evolve and grow more powerful as Kryptonians age and develop.

In some continuities, mating between Kryptonians and other species is difficult because Kryptonian DNA is so complex as to be nearly incompatible with that of other species. The only notable exception is represented by the original native Daxamite population (the race that bore that name before intermingling with the Kryptonian explorers, who later adapted the name for themselves). Breeding between Kryptonian explorers and this race created a new Kryptonian hybrid race that could interbreed with a larger number of humanoid races—including Earth humans. No other races are yet known to exhibit the same degree of compatibility of the native Daxamites. However, in some continuations humans are not only able to reproduce with Kryptonians, but are able to create fertile offspring with them.

Superpowered Kryptonians are vulnerable to kryptonite, radioactive remnants of Krypton, magic and solar radiation from red and orange suns. They are also vulnerable to physical attacks from beings native to Krypton essentially in proportion to their vulnerability in non-powered situations. In addition Kryptonian beings are vulnerable to infection from viruses or bacteria native to Krypton.

==Culture and technology==
Kryptonians are a highly culturally and technologically advanced people. Self-grown crystals, both natural and synthetic, which covered the vast majority of their planet&#x27;s surface gave their homeworld a bluish hue when viewed from space and underlay Kryptonian technology. Relatively small crystals can hold vast amounts of information. The Fortress of Solitude is often portrayed as a recreation of Krypton&#x27;s surface and a storehouse of Kryptonian knowledge.

A pictographic crest or symbol represents each Kryptonian family, or House; the head of the House usually wears it. According to the Superman movie and sequels, a shape similar to the Latin letter &quot;S&quot; represents the House of El, for example. Superman wears this same symbol on his costume, which therefore serves a dual purpose: it displays his Kryptonian heritage, as well as functioning as the &quot;S&quot; for Superman. Male Kryptonians are identified by hyphenated names which identify both them and their houses, such as Jor-El and Kal-El of the House of El. Female Kryptonians have one given name but take their father&#x27;s name as their last name. For example, Kal-El&#x27;s mother is named Lara Lor-Van, taken from her father&#x27;s name (Lor-Van).

The different Houses were also broken up into a loosely-based caste system as well. The Religious, Artist, Military and Science castes had representation on the ruling council, while the Worker caste did not. The different castes lived in buildings with different architectural styles that represented various styles throughout Krypton&#x27;s history.

The severe xenophobia of Kryptonian society conveniently explains Kal-El&#x27;s being the first Kryptonian to leave the planet. Non-superpowered Kryptonians are genetically dependent to their home planet; as such, Kal-El was sent to Earth as a newly conceived embryo within a birthing matrix in order to survive in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. He was also devoid of any Kryptonian minerals, because they would turn to kryptonite upon leaving Krypton&#x27;s atmosphere. Kryptonians are evolutionarily related to the also-severely xenophobic Daxamites. The Daxamites remain that way up through the 31st century.

Kryptonian law did not believe in capital punishment. Instead, the worst criminals were sent to the Phantom Zone, despite a lack of understanding of the nature of the zone, its danger to the imprisoned and the presence of exits.

Krypton&#x27;s red sun was named Rao. It was worshiped by the Kryptonians as a deity (albeit in a more scientific and rational way as the giver and sustainer of all life on the planet). Other deities include Nightwing and Flamebird, dragon-like deities who have inspired a number of superhero teams as well as notable dynasties of Krypton e.g., the House of El.

Just like humans domesticating their animals on Earth, Kryptonians also domesticate their own animals as well; which some of them look very similar to Earth&#x27;s animals, due to parallel evolution, while others look very different, due to divergent evolution, e.g., fish/snake/eel-like hybrid creatures called &quot;fish-snakes&quot;, goat-like creatures called &quot;Zuurt&quot;, bovine-like creatures called &quot;Rondor&quot;, rhinoceros/ceratopsian-like hybrid creatures called &quot;Thought-Beasts&quot;, and dragon-like creatures called &quot;H&#x27;Raka&quot;.

==Language and alphabet==
For most of Superman&#x27;s published history, Kryptonian writing was represented by random, alien-looking squiggles. In the 1970s, E. Nelson Bridwell attempted to rationalize the squiggles into a 118-letter alphabet called Kryptonese. This standardized alphabet was then used by DC Comics until John Byrne&#x27;s 1986 &quot;reboot&quot; of the Superman universe.

In 2000, DC introduced a transliteration alphabet for the written language, which was renamed Kryptonian.

==Calendar==
In the 1970s and 1980s, details about the Kryptonian calendar as it existed in the Earth-One universe were revealed. The Kryptonian time units were defined as follows:

* 100 thribo (Kryptonian seconds) per dendar (Kryptonian minute).
* 100 dendaro (Kryptonian minutes) per wolu (Kryptonian hour).
* 10 woluo (Kryptonian hours) per zetyar (Kryptonian day).
* six zetyaro (Kryptonian days) per fanff (Kryptonian week).
* 73 zetyaro (Kryptonian days) per lorax (Kryptonian month).
* 438 zetyaro (Kryptonian days) per amzet (Kryptonian year).
* 73 fanffo (Kryptonian weeks) per amzet (Kryptonian year).
* six loraxo (Kryptonian months) per amzet (Kryptonian year).
* The six loraxo (months) were: Belyuth, Ogtal, Ullhah, Eorx, Hefralt and Norzec.

In the Kryptonian language, the suffix &quot;o&quot; indicates the plural form of a noun.

According to one story, in which Quex-Ul had served his full sentence, 18 Kryptonian sun-cycles (amzeto) is about 25 Earth years. It can be demonstrated that one Kryptonian sun-cycle is 1.37 Earth years, as follows:

* Superman was born on 35 Eorx 9998, which occurred on February 29 in the Earth calendar.
* Krypton exploded early on 39 Ogtal 10000, which occurred on June 16 in the Earth calendar (Superman arrived on Earth two days later, on June 18).
* Therefore, there were 734 Kryptonian days (1.676 Kryptonian years) between the two events.
* Since 18 Kryptonian years is about 25 Earth years, then there were approximately 2.3 Earth years between the two events.
* The exact number of days between February 29, and June 16 two years later, is 838 (or 2.294 years).
* Thus, 1.676 Kryptonian years equals 2.294 Earth years, or 1 Kryptonian year equals roughly 1.37 Earth years.

Using this ratio of 1.37 Earth years per Kryptonian year (amzet), and ignoring any potential Kryptonian leap day and any differences in time of day, one can approximate other units of time:

* 1.37 years per amzet
* 0.99 seconds per thrib (31,556,952 seconds/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/43,800,000 thrib)
* 1.65 minutes per dendar (525949.2 minutes/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/438,000 dendar)
* 2.74 hours per wolu (8765.82 hours/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/4,380 wolu)
* 1.14 days per zetyar (365.2425 days/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/438 zetyar)

Major events in the Kryptonian calendar include:
* Jor-El and Lara were married on 47 Ullhah 9997.
* The city of Kandor was stolen by Brainiac on 33 Ogtal 9998.
* Kal-El (Superman) was born to Jor-El and Lara on 35 Eorx 9998.
* The Phantom Zone became an official method of punishment, and Jax-Ur became its first prisoner, on 67 Eorx 9999.
* Kal-El&#x27;s pet dog, Krypto, was lost in space on 54 Belyuth 10000.
* Jor-El launched the Phantom Zone projector into space on 30 Ogtal 10000.
* Lar Gand landed on Krypton and met Jor-El on 34 Ogtal 10000.
* Kal-El was sent in an interstellar rocketship towards Earth and Krypton exploded on 39 Ogtal 10000.

==Survivors==
Superman, Supergirl, Krypto, Beppo, Dev-Em, and the Eradicator survived Krypton&#x27;s destruction by being sent off-world shortly beforehand. General Zod and Ursa, among others, survived by being in the Phantom Zone. The city of Kandor was also spared from destruction, as it was shrunken and collected by Brainiac. The people of Argo City also survive Krypton&#x27;s destruction due to an energy field surrounding it, although in most universes they either die soon afterward or are captured by Brainiac.

<text>The System Management Bus (SMBus or SMB) is a single-ended simple two-wire bus for the purpose of lightweight communication. Most commonly it is found in chipsets of computer motherboards for communication with the power source for ON/OFF instructions. The exact functionality and hardware interfaces vary with vendors.

It is derived from I²C for communication with low-bandwidth devices on a motherboard, especially power related chips such as a laptop&#x27;s rechargeable battery subsystem (see Smart Battery System and ACPI). Other devices might include external master hosts, temperature sensor, fan or voltage sensors, lid switches, clock generator, and RGB lighting. Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) add-in cards may connect to an SMBus segment.

A device can provide manufacturer information, indicate its model/part number, save its state for a suspend event, report different types of errors, accept control parameters, return status over SMBus, and poll chipset registers. The SMBus is generally not user configurable or accessible. Although SMBus devices usually can&#x27;t identify their functionality, a new PMBus coalition has extended SMBus to include conventions allowing that.

The SMBus was defined by Intel and Duracell in 1994. It carries clock, data, and instructions and is based on Philips&#x27; I²C serial bus protocol. Its clock frequency range is 10 kHz to 100 kHz. (PMBus extends this to 400 kHz.) Its voltage levels and timings are more strictly defined than those of I²C, but devices belonging to the two systems are often successfully mixed on the same bus. 

SMBus is used as an interconnect in several platform management standards including: Alert Standard Format (ASF), Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware (DASH), Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI).

SMBus is used to access DRAM configuration information as part of serial presence detect (SPD). SMBus has grown into a wide variety of system enumeration use cases other than power management.

==SMBus/I²C Interoperability==
While SMBus is derived from I²C, there are several major differences between the specifications of the two busses in the areas of electricals, timing, protocols and operating modes.

===Electrical===
====Input Voltage (&quot;VIL&quot; and &quot;VIH&quot;)====
When mixing devices, the I²C specification defines the input levels to be 30% and 70% of the supply voltage &quot;VDD&quot;, which may be 5 V, 3.3 V, or any other value. Instead of relating the bus input levels to &quot;VDD&quot;, SMBus defines them to be fixed. SMBus 2.0 defines &quot;VIL,max&quot; at 0.8 V and &quot;VIH,min&quot; at 2.1 V, and supports a &quot;VDD&quot; ranging from 3 to 5 V, while in SMBus 3.0, the levels are defined at 0.8 and 1.35 V, with a &quot;VDD&quot; ranging from 1.8 to 5 V.

====Sink Current (&quot;IOL&quot;)====
SMBus 2.0 defines a ‘High Power’ class that includes a 4 mA sink current that cannot be driven by I²C chips unless the pull-up resistor is sized to I²C-bus levels.

NXP devices have a higher power set of electrical characteristics than SMBus 1.0. The main difference is the current sink capability with &quot;VOL&quot; = 0.4 V.
*SMBus low power = 350 μA
*SMBus high power = 4 mA
*I²C-bus = 3 mA
SMBus ‘high power’ devices and I²C-bus devices will work together if the pull-up resistor is sized for 3 mA.

====Frequency (&quot;FMAX&quot; and &quot;FMIN&quot;)====
The SMBus clock is defined from 10 to 100 kHz while I²C can be 0–100 kHz, 0–400 kHz, 0–1 MHz and 0–3.4 MHz, depending on the mode. This means that an I²C bus running at less than 10 kHz will not be SMBus compliant since the SMBus devices may time out. Many SMBus devices will however support lower frequencies.

SMBus 3.0 adds 400 kHz and 1 MHz bus speeds.

====Timing====
*SMBus defines a clock low time-out, TIMEOUT of 35 ms. I²C does not specify any timeout limit.
*SMBus specifies TLOW:SEXT as the cumulative clock low extend time for a slave device. I²C does not have a similar specification.
*SMBus specifies TLOW:MEXT as the cumulative clock low extend time for a master device. Again I²C does not have a similar specification.
*SMBus defines both rise and fall time of bus signals. I²C does not.
*The SMBus time-out specifications do not preclude I²C devices co-operating reliably on the SMBus. It is the responsibility of the designer to ensure that I²C devices are not going to violate these bus timing parameters.

===Protocols===
====ACK and NACK usage====
There are the following differences in the use of the NACK bus signaling:
In I²C, a slave receiver is allowed to not acknowledge the slave address, if for example it&#x27;s unable to receive because it&#x27;s performing some real time task. SMBus requires devices to acknowledge their own address always, as a mechanism to detect a removable device&#x27;s presence on the bus (battery, docking station, etc.)

I²C specifies that a slave device, although it may acknowledge its own address, may decide, some time later in the transfer, that it cannot receive any more data bytes. I²C specifies that the device may indicate this by generating the not acknowledge on the first byte to follow.

Other than to indicate a slave&#x27;s device-busy condition, SMBus also uses the NACK mechanism to indicate the reception of an invalid command or datum. Since such a condition may occur on the last byte of the transfer, it is required that SMBus devices have the ability to generate the not acknowledge after the transfer of each byte and before the completion of the transaction. This is important because SMBus does not provide any other resend signaling. This difference in the use of the NACK signaling has implications on the specific implementation of the SMBus port, especially in devices that handle critical system data such as the SMBus host and the SBS components.

====SMBus protocols====
Each message transaction on SMBus follows the format of one of the defined SMBus protocols. The SMBus protocols are a subset of the data transfer formats defined in the I²C specifications. I²C devices that can be accessed through one of the SMBus protocols are compatible with the SMBus specifications. I²C devices that do not adhere to these protocols cannot be accessed by standard methods as defined in the SMBus and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specifications.

====Address Resolution Protocol====
The SMBus uses I²C hardware and I²C hardware addressing, but adds second-level software for building special systems. In particular its specifications include an Address Resolution Protocol that can make dynamic address allocations.
Dynamic reconfiguration of the hardware and software allow bus devices to be
‘hot-plugged’ and used immediately, without restarting the system. The devices are recognized automatically and assigned unique addresses. This advantage results in a plug-and-play user interface. In both those protocols there is a very useful distinction made between a System Host and all the other devices in the system that can have the names and functions of masters or slaves.

In the context of motherboard PCI Express slots, the PCIe Electromechanical Specification expects ARP to be provided for the SMBus pins. However, because ARP is marked &quot;optional&quot; in the SMBus specification, it&#x27;s commonly left unimplemented.

====Time-out feature====
SMBus has a time-out feature which resets devices if a communication takes too long.
This explains the minimum clock frequency of 10 kHz to prevent locking up the bus. I²C can be a ‘DC’ bus, meaning that a slave device stretches the master clock when performing some routine while the master is accessing it. This will notify to the master that the slave is busy but does not want to lose the communication. The slave device will allow continuation after its task is complete. There is no limit in the I²C-bus protocol as to how long this delay can be, whereas for an SMBus system, it would be limited to 35 ms.
The SMBus protocol just assumes that if something takes too long, then it means that there is a problem on the bus and that all devices must reset in order to clear this mode. Slave devices are not then allowed to hold the clock LOW too long.

====Packet Error Checking====
SMBus 1.1 and later define optional Packet Error Checking (PEC). In that mode, a PEC (packet error code) byte is appended at the end of each transaction. The byte is calculated as CRC-8 checksum, calculated over the entire message including the address and read/write bit. The polynomial used is x8+x2+x+1 (the CRC-8-ATM HEC algorithm, initialized to zero).

====SMBALERT#====
The SMBus has an extra optional shared interrupt signal called SMBALERT#, which can be used by slaves to tell the host to ask its slaves about events of interest.
SMBus also defines a less common &quot;Host Notify Protocol&quot;, providing similar notifications but passing more data and building on the I²C multi-master mode.

==Support==
SMBus devices are supported by FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Linux, Windows 98 and newer and Windows CE.

== Replacement ==
DDR5 introduces I3C for its presence detect communication, replacing SMBus.

PCI express devices commonly use SMBus as a &quot;out-of-band management port&quot;. However, device vendors frequently use SMBus multiplexers (Mux) to manage address clashes (which are in turn caused by them &quot;not&quot; implementing the Address Resolution Protocol), causing link interruptions that break Management Component Transport Protocol and other protocols when the Mux switches targets. To solve this problem, SNIA&#x27;s Enterprise and Data Center Standard Form Factor version 3.1 (January 2023) describes a way to use I3C basic over the PCIe two-wire interface. NVM Express 2.1 (August 2024) is also reworded to allow the use of I3C, &quot;to match the new conventions used by SNIA SFF TA&#x27;s EDSFF and PCI-SIG specifications for I3C&quot;.

<doc id="530115" wikidata="Q3244349" url="?curid=530115" title="Husky">
<text>Husky is a general term for a dog used in the polar regions, primarily and specifically for work as sled dogs. It refers to a traditional northern type, notable for its cold-weather tolerance and overall hardiness. Modern racing huskies that maintain arctic breed traits (also known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs.

Huskies have continued to be used in sled-dog racing, as well as expedition and trek style tour businesses, and as a means of essential transportation in rural communities. Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;husky&quot; first came into usage in the mid to late 1700s. At this time, &quot;Esquimaux&quot; or &quot;Eskimo&quot; was a common term for pre-Columbian Arctic inhabitants of North America. Several dialectal permutations were in use including Uskee, Uskimay and Huskemaw. Thus, dogs used by Arctic people were the dogs of the Huskies, the Huskie&#x27;s dogs, and eventually simply the husky dogs. Canadian and American settlers, not well versed on Russian geography, would later extend the word to Chukotka sled dogs imported from Russia, thus giving rise to the term Siberian husky.

==History==

Nearly all dogs&#x27; genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic breeds also show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture: the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog (which are also historically associated with Arctic human populations) and to a lesser extent, the Shar Pei and Finnish Spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland Dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material; however, an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data and indicates admixture between the Taimyr wolf and the ancestors of these four high-latitude breeds.

This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment, contributing significantly to the development of the husky. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.

==Characteristics==
Huskies are energetic and athletic. They are distinguished by their hardiness and cold-weather tolerance, in contrast to many modern sprint sled dogs derived from hound and pointer crossbreeds and purebred sprinting dogs which do not have or retain these qualities. Likewise, they are distinguished from laika, as they were not developed for the primary purpose of hunting game and prey animals.

Huskies typically have a thick double coat that may come in a variety of colors. The double coat generally protects huskies against harsh winters and, contrary to what most believe, they can survive in hotter climates. During the hotter climates, huskies tend to shed their undercoat regularly to cool their bodies. In addition to shedding, huskies control their eating habits based on the season; in cooler climates, they tend to eat generous amounts, causing their digestion to generate heat, whilst in warmer climates, they eat less. Their eyes are typically pale blue, although they may also be brown, green, blue, yellow, or heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of uveitis than most other breeds.

==Breeds==
:&quot;This is a list of dog breeds which contain &quot;husky&quot; in their name. To see a complete list of sled breeds, see Sled dog.&quot;

=== Alaskan husky ===

The most commonly used dog in dog sled racing, the Alaskan husky is a mongrel bred specifically for its performance as a sled dog. The modern Alaskan husky reflects 100 years or more of crossbreeding with English Pointers, German Shepherd Dogs, Salukis and other breeds to improve its performance. They typically weigh between and may have dense or sleek fur. Alaskan huskies bear little resemblance to the typical husky breeds they originated from, or to each other.

=== Labrador Husky ===
The Labrador Husky originated in the Canadian region of Labrador. The breed probably arrived in the area with the Inuit who came to Canada around 1300 AD. Despite the name, Labrador huskies are not related to the Labrador retriever, but in fact most closely related to the Canadian Eskimo Dog. There are estimated to be 50–60 Labrador huskies in the world.

=== Mackenzie River Husky ===
The term Mackenzie River husky describes several overlapping historical populations of Arctic and sub-Arctic sled dog-type dogs, none of which constituted a breed. Dogs from the Yukon Territory were crossed with large European breeds such as St. Bernards and Newfoundlands to create a powerful freighting dog capable of surviving harsh arctic conditions during the Klondike Gold Rush.

=== Sakhalin Husky ===

The Sakhalin Husky is a critically endangered landrace and sled laika associated with Sakhalin Island and adjacent areas. They are also known Karafuto Ken, Sakhalin Laika, or Gilyak Laika. While bred primarily as a sled dog, Sakhalin Huskies are also used for hunting bear and fishing. There are approximately 20 Sakhalin Huskies remaining on Sakhalin Island.

=== Siberian Husky ===

The Siberian Husky is smaller than the similar-appearing Alaskan Malamute. They are descendants of the Chukotka sled dogs bred and used by the native Chukchi people of Siberia, a people of Paleosiberian origin, around the year 2000 BC. Imported to Alaska in the early 1900s, they were used as working dogs and racing sled dogs in Nome, Alaska throughout the 1910s, often dominating the All-Alaska Sweepstakes. They later became widely bred by recreational mushers and show-dog fanciers in the U.S. and Canada as the Siberian Husky, after the popularity garnered from the 1925 serum run to Nome. Siberians stand 20–23.5 inches, weigh between 35 and 60lbs (35-50 for females, 45-60 for males), and have been selectively bred for both appearance and pulling ability. They are still used regularly today as sled dogs by competitive, recreational, and tour-guide mushers.

<doc id="530143" wikidata="Q753621" url="?curid=530143" title="Sabine Lake">
<text>Sabine Lake is a bay on the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana, located approximately east of Houston and west of Baton Rouge, adjoining the city of Port Arthur. The lake is formed by the confluence of the Neches and Sabine Rivers and connects to the Gulf of Mexico through Sabine Pass. It forms part of the Texas–Louisiana border, falling within Jefferson and Orange Counties in Texas and Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

Sabine Lake is one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. Much of the Louisiana shore is protected by the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge. There is a long history of human habitation around the lake, including Native American settlement dating back at least 1,500 years, European exploration in the eighteenth century, and the growth of Port Arthur in the twentieth century. Today the lake serves as part of the Sabine–Neches Waterway and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and is a center for the shipping and petrochemical industries.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that Native American groups from the Marksville culture were present near the shores of Sabine Lake by . Burial mounds that may have belonged to the Karankawa have been uncovered near the north shore at what is now Port Neches, but by the time of European arrival in the eighteenth century the region was inhabited by the Atakapa. English explorers led by George Gauld mapped the lake in 1777; Spanish explorers under Antonio Gil Y&#x27;Barbo visited the lake the same year, and an expedition under José Antonio de Evia mapped the lake in 1785 as part of a survey of the Texas coast. In the early 1800s Sabine Lake was used to ship slaves and other contraband into the region by smugglers including the pirate Jean Lafitte. The waterway was also used to move timber and cotton out from the interior.

With the 1801 Treaty of Aranjuez the lake became part of the border between French Louisiana and Spanish Texas. After the Louisiana Purchase Sabine Lake formed part of the United States&#x27; border with Spanish Texas, then Mexican Texas, and finally the Republic of Texas. During the Republic period the American and Texan customs agencies came into significant conflict over the taxation of shipping on the lake, but with the Texas annexation Sabine Lake instead became part of the border between the U.S. states of Louisiana and Texas. The lake&#x27;s shores were only intermittently settled and abandoned in the mid-to-late 1800s, and the 1886 Indianola hurricane destroyed the only significant settlements nearby at Sabine Pass and Johnson Bayou.

The inlet at Sabine Pass was dredged and deepened in 1880 to ease access to the lake for shipping. In 1895 Port Arthur was founded, and the southwestern edge of the lake was channelized from Sabine Pass to Port Arthur in 1899, forming the Port Arthur Canal. The discovery of petroleum under Spindletop in 1901 began the Texas oil boom and caused rapid economic growth in nearby Beaumont, prompting interest in expanding the region&#x27;s canal system. By 1908 Sabine Lake&#x27;s channel was extended northward to the mouths of the Neches and Sabine Rivers to improve shipping access to the ports of Beaumont and Orange, forming the Sabine–Neches Canal; the region&#x27;s combined channel system is known as the Sabine–Neches Waterway. The material dredged up in the canalization was formed into Pleasure Island, an artificial barrier island along the majority of the western shore that shelters Port Arthur and the waterway. Most of the Louisiana shore was protected within the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge in 1937. In the early twentieth century the lake and its shipping channel were incorporated into a wider network of canals running from New Orleans to Galveston Bay; after World War II this network grew into the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.

==Features==

Sabine Lake is located on the Gulf Coastal Plain at the Texas–Louisiana border. The natural portions of the lake have a mean low-water depth of at most around , though the ship channels have been dredged to a depth of more than . The eastern (Louisiana) shore has little human development, and the majority is protected within the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge; the western (Texas) shore is heavily urbanized, with the city of Port Arthur and significant shipping and petrochemical infrastructure along the shore. Pleasure Island parallels the western shore for , separating the Port Arthur Canal and Sabine–Neches Canal from the main body of the lake. The Martin Luther King Bridge spans the Sabine–Neches Canal to link Port Arthur to Pleasure Island, and the Sabine Causeway connects the island to the Louisiana shore across the southern tip of the lake. Water exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Sabine Pass.

Sabine Lake is the smallest of the seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, approximately long and wide, with a surface area of . It receives the discharge from the Neches and Sabine Rivers, along with various smaller streams and the surrounding coastal watershed. The lake&#x27;s small size and high rate of freshwater inflow make it the least saline of the major Texas estuaries. Its salinity was even lower prior to the twentieth century, and its upper reaches were almost entirely fresh, but the extensive channelization of the lake since then has led to increased saltwater intrusion into the estuary, with salinity rising especially during periods of low freshwater inflow. Increasing salinity has had a negative impact on the diversity and productivity of wetland plants in the estuary.

==Ecosystem==

The dominant species of aquatic vegetation in Sabine Lake is &quot;Ruppia maritima&quot;. Aquatic fauna include a variety of finfish and shellfish, with large populations of sport fishing species such as Atlantic croaker, spotted seatrout, southern flounder, red and black drum, sheepshead and gafftopsail catfish. Other significant fish species include the bay anchovy, Gulf menhaden and spot. Commercial fishing in the lake produces mainly shellfish, especially blue crab and penaeid shrimp such as northern brown shrimp and Atlantic white shrimp. Sabine Lake is the only major Texas estuary that does not support a commercial American oyster fishery, as it lacks a suitable reef and is too polluted for legal oyster harvesting.

The land around the lake includes a blend of Western Gulf coastal grasslands and coastal marsh ecosystems, together with urban land cover in Port Arthur and its suburbs on the western shore. The majority of the non-urbanized shoreline is surrounded by brackish marshes, with halophytes such as cordgrasses and common reeds as the dominant flora. These coastal wetlands provide habitats for American alligators, Atlantic ridley sea turtles, red wolves and brown pelicans. Saltwater intrusion and land subsidence resulting from human activities in the lake since the late 1800s have caused vegetation loss and erosion, and the remaining marshes are experiencing ongoing degradation as the ecosystems adjust to the altered hydrology in the estuary.

==Industry==

The channelization of Sabine Lake has made it an important industrial waterway, one component of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the heart of the Sabine–Neches Waterway. The three ports it links to the Gulf of Mexico (Port Arthur, Beaumont and Orange) form a major nexus for the shipping and petrochemical industries, the so-called Golden Triangle of Texas. The largest industries around the lake are petroleum and natural gas extraction, petrochemical processing, shipping, and shipbuilding. Agriculture also forms a significant component of the regional economy, principally rice and soybean cultivation, livestock ranching, and commercial fishing.

<text>Sabine Pass is the natural outlet of Sabine Lake into the Gulf of Mexico. It borders Jefferson County, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

==History==
===Civil War===
Two major battles occurred here during the American Civil War, known as the First and Second Battles of Sabine Pass.

===Spanish–American War===
In May 1898, the 55th United States Congress authorized the establishment of two seacoast defense forts at Sabine Pass relative to the Texas Gulf Coast. The fortifications were a response as hostilities intensified in the Gulf of Mexico during the Cuban War of Independence often referred as the Spanish–American War. In 1983, Texas Historical Commission acknowledged the seacoast defense command posts establishing a Texas historical marker at the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historic Site.

===World War II===
In 1941, the United States authorized a coastal artillery emplacement and Harbor Entrance Control Post at the Sabine Pass natural waterway inlet as a response to Battle of the Atlantic better known as Operation Drumbeat orchestrated by Nazi Germany. The Sabine Pass military base exhibited checkpoint and guard end stations, coastal searchlights, coastal signal stations, and an observation tower. The coastal defence and fortification incorporated an artillery battery command post complementary as a Coast Guard lifeboat station initially chartered in 1870s as the United States Life-Saving Service.

The Sabine Pass coastal defense installation was deemed military surplus as the United States Department of War operations tapered by 1945.

The channel is also the only conceivable way that ships produced by shipyards in Orange and Beaumont could have reached the seas.

===Hurricanes===
A powerful storm made landfall at Sabine Pass on October 12, 1886. It was the tenth hurricane of the season, now referred to as The Texas-Louisiana Hurricane of 1886, that all but wiped out Sabine Pass and Johnson Bayou in Cameron Parish. The storm, now considered to have been a category 3 (Saffir–Simpson scale), resulted in at least 196 deaths. Occurrence of the storm was recorded in the controversial &quot;Diary of Louise&quot; on October 20, 1886.

Hurricane Rita made landfall on September 24, 2005, and on September 12–13, 2008, Hurricane Ike struck Sabine Pass and Galveston, generating the highest surge of which is, according to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), the highest ever recorded at Sabine Pass.

==Current==

Sabine Pass is a site for an LNG terminal because it is located along one of a few deepwater ports along the Gulf Coast suitable for LNG. The region also has an existing pipeline infrastructure with access to South East Texas and U.S. markets. The terminal can import LNG, as well as export up to 30 million tonnes of LNG per year.

The former city of Sabine Pass, Texas, is now a neighborhood of Port Arthur.
