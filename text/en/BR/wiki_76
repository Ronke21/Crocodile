<text>Qinghai Lake is the largest lake in China. Located in an endorheic basin in Qinghai Province, to which it gave its name, Qinghai Lake is classified as an alkaline salt lake. The lake has fluctuated in size, shrinking over much of the 20th century but increasing since 2004. It had a surface area of , an average depth of , and a maximum depth of in 2008.

==Names==
&quot;Qinghai&quot; is the atonal pinyin romanisation of the Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese name Although modern Chinese distinguishes between the colors blue and green, this distinction did not exist in classical Chinese. The color (&quot;qīng&quot;) was a &quot;single&quot; color inclusive of both blue and green as separate shades. The name is thus variously translated as &quot;Blue Sea&quot;, &quot;Green Sea&quot;, &quot;Blue-Green Sea&quot;, &quot;Blue/Green Sea&quot;, etc. For a time after its wars with the Xiongnu, Han China connected the lake with the legendary &quot;Western Sea&quot; assumed to balance the East China Sea, but as the Han Empire expanded further west into the Tarim Basin other lakes assumed the title. The former names Chinghai, Ch&#x27;ing-hai, or Ch&#x27;inghai Lake are based on the Wade–Giles romanisation of the same Chinese name.

Qinghai Lake is also known as from its Classical Mongolian name . The modern Mongolian form of the same name is (). Similar to Chinese, Classical Mongolian used inclusive of both the color of the sky and fresh grass, but now uses specifically for deep or dark blue distinguished both from light blue (, ) and green (, ). Classical Mongolian also did not distinguish between lakes and larger bodies of water. The Chinese name, using &quot;sea&quot; rather than &quot;lake,&quot; is thus an overly literal calque of this name, used by the Upper Mongols, some of whom made up the local ruling class during the standardization of western Chinese toponyms in the Qing dynasty. Similar use of the Chinese word for &quot;sea&quot; to translate Mongolian lake toponyms can be seen elsewhere around Qinghai, as with Lake Heihai (&quot;Black Sea&quot;) in the Kunlun Mountains.

The Tibetans also separately calqued the name as or (, &quot;Blue Lake or Sea&quot;).

==Geography==
Qinghai Lake lies about west of Xining in a hollow of the Tibetan Plateau at above sea level. It lies between Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northeastern Qinghai in Northwest China. The lake has fluctuated in size, shrinking over much of the 20th century but increasing since 2004. It had a surface area of , an average depth of , and a maximum depth of in 2008.

Twenty-three rivers and streams empty into Qinghai Lake, most of them seasonal. Five permanent streams provide 80% of the total influx. The relatively low inflow and high evaporation rates have turned Qinghai saline and alkaline; the salt concentration is presently about 1.4% by weight (seawater has a salt concentration of about 3.5%), with a pH of 9.3. It has increased in salinity and basicity since the early Holocene.

At the tip of the peninsula on the western side of the lake are Cormorant Island and Egg Island, collectively known as the Bird Islands.

Qinghai Lake became isolated from the Yellow River about 150,000 years ago. If the water level were to rise by approximately , the connection to the Yellow River would be reestablished via the low pass to the east.

18,000 years ago, just after the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, the lake level of Lake Qinghai was around 30 metres lower than today. Between 15,600 and 10,700 years ago, lake levels secularly increased to around 10 metres lower than the present lake level, after which they declined slightly until around 9,200 years ago, when they began to rise again. Around 5,900 years ago, lake levels reached a peak of a few metres higher than today, before declining again amidst a regional cooling and drying trend until 1,400 years ago, when they were less than 10 metres lower than average modern levels. They then began to rise once more until reaching their present level.

===Climate===
The lake often remains frozen for three months continuously in winter.

==History==

During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), substantial numbers of Han Chinese lived in the Xining valley to the east. In the 17th century, Mongolic-speaking Oirat and Khalkha tribals migrated to Qinghai and became known as Qinghai Mongols. In 1724, the Qinghai Mongols led by revolted against the Qing dynasty. The Yongzheng Emperor, after putting down the rebellion, stripped away Qinghai&#x27;s autonomy and imposed direct rule. Although some Tibetans lived around the lake, the Qing maintained an administrative division from the time of Güshi Khan between the Dalai Lama&#x27;s western realm (slightly smaller than the current Tibet Autonomous Region) and the Tibetan-inhabited areas in the east. Yongzheng also sent Manchu and Han settlers to dilute the Mongols.

During Nationalist rule (1928–1949), the Han formed a majority of Qinghai Province&#x27;s residents, although Chinese Muslims (Hui) dominated the government. The Kuomintang Hui general Ma Bufang, having invited Kazakh Muslims, joined the governor of Qinghai and other high ranking Qinghai and national government officials in conducting a joint Kokonuur Lake Ceremony to worship the God of the Lake. During the ritual, the Chinese national anthem was sung and all participants bowed to a Portrait of Kuomintang founder Sun Yat-sen as well as to the God of the Lake. Participants, both Han and Muslim, made offerings to the god.
After the 1949 Chinese revolution, refugees from the 1950s Anti-Rightist Movement settled in the area west of Qinghai Lake. After the Chinese economic reform in the 1980s, drawn by new business opportunities, migration to the area increased, causing ecological stresses. Fresh grass production in Gangcha County north of the lake declined from a mean of to in 1987. In 2001, the State Forestry Administration of China launched the &quot;Retire Cropland, Restore Grasslands&quot; () campaign and started confiscating Tibetan and Mongol pastoralists&#x27; guns to preserve the endangered Przewalski&#x27;s gazelle.

Prior to the 1960s, 108 freshwater rivers emptied into the lake. As of 2003, 85% of the river mouths have dried up, including the lake&#x27;s largest tributary, the Buha River. In between 1959 and 1982, there had been an annual water level drop of , which was reversed at a rate of between 1983 and 1989, but has continued to drop since. The Chinese Academy of Sciences reported in 1998 the lake was again threatened with loss of surface area due to livestock over-grazing, land reclamations, and natural causes. Surface area decreased 11.7% in the period from 1908 to 2000. During that period, higher lake floor areas were exposed and numerous water bodies separated from the rest of the main lake. In the 1960s, the Gahai Lake (尕海, &quot;Gǎhǎi&quot;) appeared in the north; Shadao Lake (沙岛, &quot;Shādǎo&quot;), covering an area of to the northeast, followed in the 1980s, along with Haiyan Lake (海晏, &quot;Hǎiyàn&quot;) of . Another daughter lake split off in 2004. In addition, the lake has now split into half a dozen more small lakes at the border. Qinghai Provincial Remote Sensing Center, attributed the separation of Qinghai Lake to shrinkage of the water surface as a result of a lowered water level and desertification in the region. The water surface has shrunk by over the last three decades.

==Wildlife==

The lake is located at the crossroads of several bird migration routes across Asia. Many species use Qinghai as an intermediate stop during migration. As such, it is a focal point in global concerns regarding avian influenza (H5N1), as a major outbreak here could spread the virus across Europe and Asia, further increasing the chances of a pandemic. Minor outbreaks of H5N1 have already been identified at the lake. The Bird Islands have been sanctuaries of the Qinghai Lake Natural Protection Zone since 1997.

There are five native fish species: The edible naked carp (&quot;Gymnocypris przewalskii&quot;, ), which is the most abundant in the lake, and four stoneloaches (&quot;Triplophysa stolickai&quot;, &quot;T. dorsonotata&quot;, &quot;T. scleroptera&quot; and &quot;T. siluroides&quot;). Other Yellow River fish species occurred in the lake, but they disappeared with the increasing salinity and basicity, beginning in the early Holocene.

==Culture==
There is an island in the western part of the lake with a temple and a few hermitages called &quot;Mahādeva, the Heart of the Lake&quot;, &quot;mTsho snying Ma hā de wa&quot; in Tibetan, which historically was home to a Buddhist monastery. The temple was also used for religious purposes and ceremonies. No boat was used during summer, so monks and pilgrims traveled to and from only when the lake froze over in winter. A nomad described the size of the island by saying that: &quot;if in the morning a she-goat starts to browse the grass around it clockwise and its kid anti-clockwise, they will meet only in the night, which shows how big the island is.&quot; It is also known as the place to which Gushri Khan and other Khoshut Mongols migrated during the 1620s.

The lake is currently circumnavigated by pilgrims, mainly Tibetan Buddhists, especially every Horse Year of the 12-year cycle. Nikolay Przhevalsky estimated it would take about eight days by horse or 15 walking to circumambulate the lake, but pilgrims report it takes about 18 days on horseback, and one took 23 days walking to complete the circuit.

<doc id="527734" wikidata="Q1157150" url="?curid=527734" title="Dafydd Iwan">
<text>Dafydd Iwan Jones (born 24 August 1943) is a Welsh singer and nationalist politician who rose to fame writing and performing folk music in the Welsh language. From 2003 to 2010, Iwan was the president of Plaid Cymru, a political party which advocates for Welsh independence from the UK.

==Early life==
Dafydd Iwan Jones was born in Brynamman, Carmarthenshire. One of four boys, his siblings include the actor Huw Ceredig and the politician Alun Ffred Jones. His paternal grandfather, Fred Jones, was a member of the Bardic family Teulu&#x27;r Cilie, and a founding member of Plaid Cymru. He spent most of his youth in Bala in Gwynedd before attending the University of Wales, Cardiff, where he studied architecture.

==Musical career==
Iwan&#x27;s earliest material was Welsh translations of songs by American folk/protest singers (Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Bob Dylan) until he began to write his first ballads. The most prominent of these were political, including the satirical song, &quot;Carlo&quot; (&quot;Charles&quot;). This was written for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. Iwan has also written love ballads and variations on traditional Welsh folk tunes.

By the late 1960s, he was receiving television coverage both for his music and for his political activities as a member of Cymdeithas yr Iaith. He was imprisoned in 1970 for his refusal to pay fines for defacing English-language road signs as part of the fight for Welsh-language rights, serving three weeks of a three-month sentence. This event was commemorated in his song &quot;Pam fod eira&#x27;n wyn?&quot; (&quot;Why is snow white?&quot;). His song &quot;Peintio&#x27;r byd yn wyrdd&quot; (&quot;Painting the World Green&quot;) was regarded as a &quot;battle hymn&quot; of the road signs campaign.

During the 1970s, his political interests (and songs) took in such themes as Pinochet&#x27;s Chile, Welsh devolution, the Vietnam War and the Northern Ireland troubles. Later songs mention events such as the Tiananmen Square massacre (1989), the Gulf War (1990) and opencast mining in the south Wales valleys (1995).

In 1982 and 1983, Iwan embarked on two tours (and accompanying records) with the folk group Ar Log.

Around the turn of the millennium, he signalled an end to regular performances, although he remains an occasional performer.

=== Yma o Hyd ===
&quot;Yma O Hyd&quot; (&quot;Still Here&quot;) was released in 1981 to “raise the spirits, to remind people we still speak Welsh against all odds. To show we are still here&quot;. Since then, the song has become an unofficial Welsh anthem as well as an unofficial anthem for the Wales national football team.

In January 2020, the song reached number one in the UK iTunes chart, spurred on by purchases by supporters of Welsh independence group YesCymru. The campaign mirrored the success of the Wolfe Tones song &quot;Come Out, Ye Black and Tans&quot; earlier that month.

The song was also sung live by Dafydd Iwan before Wales&#x27; last two games of their first successful FIFA World Cup qualification since 1958. Gareth Bale, the Welsh captain also led the Welsh team singing along with Dafydd Iwan after the final match. The performance and Wales&#x27;s qualification led to the song returning to number one in the UK iTunes chart.

==Public life==
Using his architecture studies, in 1971 Iwan was one of the founders of (Gwynedd Housing Association) and was involved in other projects to provide homes for the local population in north-west Wales.

Dafydd Iwan was one of the founders of (Sain Records Ltd), one of the main Welsh music labels.

Formerly a Plaid Cymru councillor in Gwynedd, he lost his seat in the May 2008 local elections.

Iwan&#x27;s long service to the Welsh language led to his being made an honorary member of the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod at Bangor in 1971.

Iwan escaped a driving ban (for speeding offences) in October 2003 on the basis that he needed to drive for his musical and political duties.

Iwan became President of Plaid Cymru in 2003.

As part of his campaign seeking re-election as President of Plaid Cymru, Iwan launched a campaign blog &quot;Dafydd 4 President&quot; in July 2008.

On 22 October 2011, Dafydd and his wife Bethan came to watch the Welsh derby, Wrexham A.F.C. vs Newport County A.F.C. Dafydd sang his hit song &quot;Yma O Hyd&quot; in front of a crowd of 4,000 before the teams came out. He was invited to sing by the new Wrexham FC Supporters Group, who chose their name &quot;Yma O Hyd&quot; after his song.

In July 2023, Iwan was awarded an honorary degree from Bangor University, in Bangor, Gwynedd, for his &quot;contribution to Welsh Culture, Language, Music and the Arts.&quot;

<doc id="527745" wikidata="Q7405857" url="?curid=527745" title="Salt Lake, Hawaii">
<text>Salt Lake is a neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii on the island of O‘ahu. The area is also known as Āliamanu after a nearby crater, although Salt Lake itself is in a crater called &quot;Ālia pa‘akai&quot; — meaning &quot;salt pond&quot; in the Hawaiian language. The Salt Lake community was developed in the 1960s during a construction boom, providing residents with an expansive view of downtown Honolulu and the sugarcane plantations of the central plain of O‘ahu. It is a community of high-rise condominiums, mid-rise town-dwellings, and houses snaking around the remnants of a now freshwater lake.

The U.S. Postal Code for Salt Lake is 96818. Salt Lake is a part of the 15th District of the Hawaii Senate, currently represented by State Senator Glenn Wakai and the 32nd District of the Hawaii House of Representatives, currently represented by Linda Ichiyama. It is also a part of Council District VII of the City and County of Honolulu, currently represented by Radiant Cordero.

== Geography and history ==
The Salt Lake community is built in the larger and easternmost of three overlapping, low profile, tuff cones or volcanic craters: Makalapa, Āliamanu and Āliapa‘akai. A lake, at one time 1.5 km across (20 ha) but very shallow, formed in the bowl of Āliapa‘akai fed by freshwater springs or possibly seawater seepages (Alexander, 1926 in Maciolek, 1982). Because the lake had no outlet, water loss was largely by evaporation, concentrating salts. Up until 1910, the lake was regularly so salty that salt deposits formed around the shore. In that year, an artesian well was dug to bring the water level higher (and salt content lower) for use as a mullet fish pond; a tunnel, dug through the southeast rim of the crater, controlled the water level and provided an outlet (Macdonald, Abbott, and Peterson. 1983). This act, and later construction of a larger drainage outlet, eventually removed the salt from Salt Lake.

An &quot;ahupuaʻa&quot; in ancient Hawaii was a land division that stretched from a mountain to the sea. The area called Moanalua eventually became the property of the estate of Samuel M. Damon. Before him, it belonged to the House of Kamehameha. Damon was involved with the Provisional Government of Hawaii that took power after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and abdication of Queen Liliuokalani. Damon later became one of the first trustees of the Kamehameha Schools with his business partner philanthropist Charles Reed Bishop. The Damon estate sold some of the land to commercial and residential developers in 1956. After statehood, Governor of Hawaii John A. Burns promoted the development as a modernization project.
In 1966 the lake was filled in except for a pond in the Honolulu Country Club golf course at .

=== Roadways ===
Salt Lake&#x27;s growth was mainly attributed to the ease (in those days) with which residents could travel to and from downtown Honolulu and Waikīkī, where many worked. Salt Lake&#x27;s main street is Salt Lake Boulevard, running the length of the community, from Moanalua High School to Aloha Stadium, connecting Puuloa Road (Hawaii Route 66) and Kamehameha Highway (Hawaii Route 99). Its major arteries are Ala Ilima Street, Likini Street, Ala Lilikoi Street and Ala Napunani Street. Most of Salt Lake&#x27;s residential streets are named after native flora and fauna. For example, the &quot;‘ilima&quot; is the official flower of the City &amp; County of Honolulu.

Highways and freeways passing close by Salt Lake include the Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani Freeway (no exits or entrances), Moanalua Freeway (Exit 2 – Ala Napunani; Exit 3 – Puuloa 

Road), and Nimitz Highway (State Rte. 92).

=== Military ===
Salt Lake is almost surrounded by military installations. Nearby Fort Shafter is the headquarters of the United States Army Pacific. Hickam Air Force Base is headquarters of the United States Pacific Air Forces. Pearl Harbor is headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. United States Indo-Pacific Command is to the north of Salt Lake at Camp H. M. Smith. Tripler Army Medical Center, visible on the heights to the northeast, is the principal U.S. military medical facility for Asia and the Pacific Basin. Coast Artillery Battery Tiernon, which mounted 2 X 3&quot; guns, was located at Salt Lake for the protection of Pearl Harbor.

=== Airport ===
Although not regarded as part of Salt Lake, the Honolulu International Airport is very close, just to the south. The area surrounding the airport is often referred to as the airport district, a commercial and retail region built up along Nimitz Highway. Located there are office buildings, the main United States Postal Service center in the state, and Ke&#x27;ehi Lagoon.

== Community ==
A 2003 special feature of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; classified Salt Lake as affluent upper-middle class with equal distribution of European Americans and second and third generations of Filipino Americans and Japanese Americans. Korean American families have also been making their presence known most recently. There are under 30,000 people living in Salt Lake. Based on surveys compiled by the University of Hawaii, residents are composed of mostly Honolulu professionals and military officers choosing to live off base. The neighborhood community is home to the families of officers and enlisted servicemen from the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard and Navy.

According to the 2000 report of the United States Census Bureau, Salt Lake ranked eighth of all the neighborhood communities in Hawai‘i in terms of median annual household income. It ranked second in median home values, then $875,000. Waikīkī was highest.

===Education===

Moanalua High School was opened in 1972 in the newly developed community. It was dubbed by &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; as the &quot;Private School of Public Schools&quot;. This compares it to Iolani School and Punahou School. Also serving the community are Radford High School, Aliamanu Elementary School and Aliamanu Middle School, formerly known as Aliamanu Intermediate School until 1997. Salt Lake Elementary School hugs the slopes of the Aliamanu crater. There are two schools serving the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu, Holy Family Catholic Academy and the Saint Philomena Early Learning Center at Saint Philomena Church.

===Commercial center===
The commercial center of Salt Lake is Salt Lake Shopping Center, bound by Ala Ilima Street, Ala Lilikoi Street and Salt Lake Boulevard. Its anchor tenants are a Safeway grocery store, a Longs Drugs store and the only McDonald&#x27;s in the region. In the 1980s, Mayor of Honolulu Frank Fasi established a mobile satellite city hall at Salt Lake Shopping Center to provide city services for residents without having to travel into City Hall. Salt Lake Shopping Center at one time was home to the Salt Lake Moanalua branch of the Hawaii State Public Library System until it moved to the campus of Aliamanu Elementary and Middle Schools.

===Parks===
Salt Lake is considered a green neighborhood community, endowed with large stretches of park lands. The largest of the parks is Salt Lake District Park renovated in 2003. The park has hiking trails around the slopes of Āliamanu and Āliapa‘akai craters. Salt Lake District Park has playing fields, basketball and tennis courts, multipurpose buildings and a gymnasium operated by the City &amp; County of Honolulu. A 50-meter swimming pool is the newest addition.

Smaller parks in the midst of high-rise condominiums include Salt Lake Municipal Park, which hosts the People&#x27;s Market each Saturday morning. Established by former Mayor Frank Fasi, the People&#x27;s Market allows Salt Lake residents to purchase fresh produce and fish from independent local producers. Hoa Aloha Park on Ala Ilima Street is the site of weekend soccer games.

===Community events===
Salt Lake is home to various public annual events:
* Menehune Classic is held in the fall, opening the competitive marching band season. One of the most important music festivals in Honolulu, various high school marching bands perform at the Moanalua High School football field showing off skill and precision. Moanalua High School is home to one of the preeminent marching bands in the state, having performed throughout the world.
* Winter Craft Fair is held each December as entrepreneurs gather on the campus of Moanalua High School to sell their unique goods and fresh, hot food. A similar craft fair is held each spring.

<text>Photophobia is a medical symptom of abnormal intolerance to visual perception of light. As a medical symptom, photophobia is not a morbid fear or phobia, but an experience of discomfort or pain to the eyes due to light exposure or by presence of actual physical sensitivity of the eyes, though the term is sometimes additionally applied to abnormal or irrational fear of light, such as heliophobia. The term &quot;photophobia&quot; comes .

==Causes==
Patients may develop photophobia as a result of several different medical conditions, related to the eye, the nervous system, genetic, or other causes.

Photophobia may manifest itself in an increased response to light starting at any step in the visual system, such as:
* Too much light entering the eye. Too much light can enter the eye if it is damaged, such as with corneal abrasion and retinal damage, or if its pupil is unable to normally constrict (seen with damage to the oculomotor nerve).
* Due to albinism, the lack of pigment in the colored part of the eyes (irises) makes them somewhat translucent. This means that the irises cannot completely block light from entering the eye.
* Overstimulation of the photoreceptors in the retina
* Excessive electric impulses to the optic nerve
* Excessive response in the central nervous system

Common causes of photophobia include migraine headaches, TMJ, cataracts, Sjögren syndrome, mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), or severe eye diseases such as uveitis or corneal abrasion. A more extensive list follows:

===Eye-related===
Causes of photophobia relating directly to the eye itself include:

* Achromatopsia
* Aniridia
* Anticholinergic drugs may cause photophobia by paralyzing the iris sphincter muscle
* Aphakia
* Blepharitis
* Buphthalmos
* Cataracts
* Coloboma
* Cone dystrophy
* Congenital abnormalities of the eye
* Viral conjunctivitis
* Corneal abrasion
* Corneal dystrophy
* Corneal ulcer
* Disruption of the corneal epithelium, such as that caused by a corneal foreign body or keratitis
* Ectopia lentis
* Endophthalmitis
* Eye trauma caused by disease, injury, or infection such as chalazion, episcleritis, keratoconus, or optic nerve hypoplasia
* Hydrophthalmos, or congenital glaucoma
* Iritis
* Isotretinoin has been associated with photophobia
* Optic neuritis
* Pigment dispersion syndrome 
* Pupillary dilation (naturally or chemically induced)
* Retinal detachment
* Scarring of the cornea or sclera
* Uveitis
===Nervous-system-related===
Neurological causes for photophobia include:

* Autism spectrum disorder
* Chiari malformation
* Dyslexia
* Encephalitis, including myalgic encephalomyelitis
* Meningitis
* Trigeminal disturbance causes central sensitization (hence, multiple other associated hypersensitivities). Causes can be bad bite, infected tooth, etc.
* Progressive supranuclear palsy, where photophobia can sometimes precede the clinical diagnosis by years
* Subarachnoid haemorrhage
* Tumor of the posterior cranial fossa
* Visual snow along with many symptoms

===Other causes===

* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Albinism
* Ariboflavinosis
* Benzodiazepines
* Chemotherapy
* Chikungunya
* Cystinosis
* Drug withdrawal
* Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
* Infectious mononucleosis
* Influenza
* Magnesium deficiency
* Mercury poisoning
* Migraine
* Mustard gas exposure
* Rabies
* Tyrosinemia type II
* Superior canal dehiscence syndrome
==Treatment==
Treatment for light sensitivity addresses the underlying cause, whether it be an eye, nervous system or other cause. If the triggering factor or underlying cause can be identified and treated, photophobia may disappear. Tinted glasses are sometimes used.

==Artificial light==
People with photophobia may feel eye pain from even moderate levels of artificial light and avert their eyes from artificial light sources. Ambient levels of artificial light may also be intolerable to persons afflicted with photophobia such that they dim or remove the light source, or go into a dimmer lit room, such a one lit by refraction of light from outside the room. Alternatively, they may wear dark sunglasses, sunglasses designed to filter peripheral light, precision tinted glasses, and/or wide-brimmed sun hats or baseball caps. Some types of photophobia may be helped with the use of precision tinted lenses which block the green-to-blue end of the light spectrum without blurring or impeding vision.

Other strategies for relieving photophobia include the use of tinted contact lenses and/or the use of prescription eye drops that constrict the pupil, thus reducing the amount of light entering the eye. Such strategies may be limited by the amount of light needed for proper vision under given conditions, however. Dilating drops may also help relieve eye pain from muscle spasms or seizures triggered by lighting/migraine, allowing a person to &quot;ride out the migraine&quot; in a dark or dim room. A paper by Stringham and Hammond, published in the &quot;Journal of Food Science&quot;, reviews studies of effects of consuming Lutein and Zeaxanthin on visual performance, and notes a decrease in sensitivity to glare.

==Disability==
Photophobia may preclude or limit a person from working in places where lighting is used, unless the person is able to obtain a reasonable accommodation like being allowed to wear tinted glasses. Some people with photophobia may thereby be better able to work at night or be more easily accommodated in the workplace at night.

Outdoor night lighting may be equally offensive for persons with photophobia, however, given the wide variety of bright lighting used for illuminating residential, commercial and industrial areas, such as LED (light-emitting diode) lamps.

The increasing popularity of &quot;overpoweringly intense&quot; LED headlights being used on &quot;pickups and S.U.V.s&quot; has prompted more frequent reports of photophobia among motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians.

<text>HMAS &quot;Samarai&quot; (P 85), named after the island of Samarai and its former town, was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Completed in 1968, the vessel was one of five assigned to the RAN&#x27;s Papua New Guinea (PNG) Division. The patrol boat was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in 1974 as HMPNGS &quot;Samarai&quot;. She remained in service until 1987, when she was paid off and used as a parts hulk.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, fourteen were ordered for the RAN, five of which were intended for the Papua New Guinea Division of the RAN, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Samarai&quot; was built by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, Queensland. &quot;Samarai&quot; was launched on 14 July 1967, and commissioned on 1 March 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Samarai&quot; arrived in Port Moresby on 16 April 1968, before travelling with her sister ship &quot;Aitape&quot; for her home port at the RAN base at Los Negros Island, Manus Province on 3 January 1968. Primary roles of the new patrol boats were fisheries protection and sea training, but also undertook search and rescue, medical evacuation and monitoring of navigational aids roles. The ship&#x27;s company was made up of both Australian and PNG servicemen. Prior to the arrival of the &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats, surveillance of PNG waters was conducted by small coastal craft and occasional visits by larger RAN warships, but the PNG Division was now able to chase and apprehend vessels suspected of illegal fishing.

&quot;Samarai&quot; was one of the five &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats of the RAN PNG Division transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force&#x27;s (PNGDF) Maritime Element (now Maritime Operations Element) on 14 November 1974 when the PNGDF took over maritime functions from the RAN. They formed the PNGDF Patrol Boat Squadron based at Manus.

&quot;Samarai&quot; was paid off in 1987, and was used as a parts hulk.

<text>USS &quot;Farragut&quot; (DLG-6/DDG-37) was the lead ship of her class of guided-missile destroyers (originally destroyer leaders) built for the United States Navy during the 1950s.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Farragut&quot; class was the first class of missile-armed carrier escorts to be built as such for the USN. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draft of . They displaced at full load. Their crew consisted of 23 officers and 337 enlisted men.

The ships were equipped with two geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by 4 water-tube boilers. The turbines were intended to produce to reach the designed speed of . The &quot;Farragut&quot; class had a range of at a speed of .

The &quot;Farragut&quot;-class ships were armed with a 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 gun forward and two twin mounts for 3-inch/50-caliber guns, one on each broadside amidships. They were fitted with an eight-round ASROC launcher between the 5-inch (127 mm) gun and the bridge. The Farragut (DDG-37) was the only ship of her class that had an ASROC magazine mounted behind the launcher. The class was already top-heavy and the addition of the magazine reportedly made it worse, so the decision was made not to equip the other nine ships with magazines. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two triple sets of Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The primary armament of the &quot;Farragut&quot;s was the Terrier anti-aircraft missile designed to defend the carrier battle group. They were fired via the dual-arm Mark 10 launcher and the ships stowed a total of 40 missiles for the launcher.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Farragut&quot;, named for Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, was laid down as DLG-6 by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 3 June 1957, launched on 15 July 1958 by Mrs. H. D. Felt, wife of the Vice Chief of Naval Operations and commissioned on 10 December 1960. &quot;Farragut&quot; was reclassified as a guided missile destroyer on 30 June 1975 and designated DDG-37. &quot;USS Farragut&quot; was decommissioned on 31 October 1989, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold for scrap on 16 December 1994. On 26 September 2006 a contract to dismantle ex-&quot;Farragut&quot; was awarded to International Shipbreaking Limited of Brownsville, Texas. The ship&#x27;s bell is currently being kept and preserved at Admiral Farragut Academy in St. Petersburg, Florida.

<doc id="527770" wikidata="Q3086280" url="?curid=527770" title="Le Journal de Montréal">
<text> is a daily French-language tabloid newspaper published in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It has the largest circulation of any newspaper in Quebec and is also the largest French-language daily newspaper in North America. Established by Pierre Péladeau in 1964, it is owned by Quebecor Media, and is hence a sister publication of TVA flagship CFTM-DT. It is also Canada&#x27;s largest tabloid newspaper. Its head office is located on 4545 Frontenac Street in Montreal.

 covers mostly local and provincial news, as well as sports, arts and justice. It is known for its sensationalist news, and its columnists who are often public figures. Since 2013 the newspaper also has an investigation desk that published several major news stories about Quebec&#x27;s politics, businesses, crime and national security. It is the only Montreal newspaper that prints on Sundays since &quot;La Presse&quot; and &quot;The Gazette&quot; dropped their Sunday editions (La Presse has had an electronic edition on Sunday since the launch of La Presse +).

==History==
Taking advantage of a labor dispute in &quot;La Presse&quot;, the leading daily newspaper in Montreal at the time, businessman Pierre Péladeau launched a new tabloid newspaper. The first issue was launched on newsstands June 15, 1964. Although Péladeau&#x27;s newspaper would evolve for several years, the first edition was compiled in a single weekend.

Over the years, the newspaper gained a substantial share of an increasingly important market, sending a significant number of copies to the American state of Florida—Florida being a popular destination for snowbird Quebecers.
In the wake of its expansion, the paper enlisted the services of several renowned journalists who previously had worked for competitors, including Jacques Beauchamp and . One of the key journalists of this tabloid was Gérard Cellier, a French immigrant who landed in Quebec in 1956. When launching the , Pierre Peladeau could rely on Cellier&#x27;s services to carry out the destiny of the tabloid. Appointed Director in 1964, Cellier remained in office until 1985, eventually becoming director of information and production. For 21 years he was largely responsible for the success of this newspaper, and in many respects, was one of the spearheads of the Quebecor empire. He died of cancer in 1997.

The &quot;Courrier du cœur&quot; was maintained by , a prominent personality in the arts in Quebec. Then, following the death of Desrameaux, took over the column, known as &#x27;Le courrier de Solange&#x27; for 25 years. She was hired by Jacques Beauchamp in 1976.

 earned a reputation as a sports and news item oriented newspaper until the early 2000s. Inspired by the tabloids of Britain, it has gradually specialized in investigating reports and infiltrations. The space allocated to news items has decreased significantly and opinion pages have appeared.

 has a more populist tone than that of its main competitors. It is also distinguished by its investigative journalism. In 2003, one of its journalists, , infiltrated the Raëlians, over the course of nine months, before publishing a series of reports and eventually a book. Following a series of investigations into the Hells Angels motorcycle gang, reporter Michel Auger became the victim of an attempted assassination by individuals associated with the outlaw motorcycle gang.

In September 2005, the newspaper underwent a major graphical overhaul to make it appear more modern. This change was accompanied by the addition of several new columnists, including journalist and television host Richard Martineau, former Quebec government ministers Yves Séguin and Joseph Facal, former federal government Minister Sheila Copps, former hockey player Guy Lafleur and the ex-hacker Mafiaboy.

On January 24, 2009, Quebecor Media locked out 243 of its unionized staff, who are members of the Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux. At the heart of the dispute, was the increased convergence between media outlets in the group, job cuts in the classified advertising and accounting departments, and the lengthening of the workweek. Three days after the conflict began, a strike mandate was passed by the affected employees. The locked out workers published their own, competing newspaper, called &quot;Rue Frontenac&quot;, which was published on paper weekly and more often online. continued to publish with the use of strikebreakers, managers, and wire services. After 25 months on strike, 64% of unionized employees agreed to a settlement proposal submitted by an arbitrator to the case.

== Circulation ==
 has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 232,332 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

<doc id="527777" wikidata="Q1356838" url="?curid=527777" title="Lake Nipissing">
<text>Lake Nipissing (; , ) is a lake in the Canadian province of Ontario. It has a surface area of , a mean elevation of above sea level, and is located between the Ottawa River and Georgian Bay. Lake Nipissing is the third-largest lake entirely in Ontario. It is relatively shallow for a large lake, with an average depth of only . The shallowness of the lake makes for many sandbars along the lake&#x27;s irregular shoreline. The lake reaches a maximum depth of 64 m (210 ft) near the mouth of the French River, off the shore of Blueberry Island. The lake has many islands most of which are protected under the Protection of Significant Wetlands scheme, controlled by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.

The largest population centre on the lake&#x27;s shoreline is the city of North Bay. North Bay sits along the lake&#x27;s northeastern shoreline. Other notable towns include Callander (south of North Bay along Highway 11). The larger towns toward the western end of the lake are Sturgeon Falls, Garden Village, Cache Bay and Lavigne.

==Etymology==
The lake&#x27;s name comes from the Ojibwe language word &quot;nibiinsing&quot; which means &quot;at little water&quot; The name of the lake in the Ojibwe language of the surrounding indigenous communities (Dokis and Nipissing First Nations) is &quot;Gichi-nibiinsing-zaaga’igan&quot;, meaning &quot;Big little-water lake&quot;. The name &quot;Nipissing&quot; was also given to many places in the area, notably the Township of Nipissing, Nipissing District, and Nipissing University.

==Geography and history==

Lake Nipissing drains into Georgian Bay, which is a part of Lake Huron, via the French River. Lake Nipissing lies about northwest of Algonquin Provincial Park. The French fur trader Étienne Brûlé was the first European to visit the lake in 1610. Jean Nicolet, another French trader and explorer had a &quot;cabin and trading-house&quot; for eight or nine years living among the Indigenous people on the shores of Lake Nipissing until 1633 when he was recalled to Quebec to become Commissary and Indian Interpreter for the &quot;Company of the Hundred Associates.&quot; In a map dated 1776, the lake is still referred to with its French name &quot;Lac des Sorcières&quot;.

During the American Revolutionary War, Lake Nipissing was proposed as the boundary in the instructions of the Continental Congress to John Adams, the Commissioner appointed to negotiate a treaty of peace with Great Britain.

The first permanent European settlement on the lake dates from around 1874 with a trading post of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company on the northwest corner in what is now Sturgeon Falls. In 1882 the North-West Mounted Police established their presence on the north east shore.

The lake contains over 40 different species of fish. Numerous sport fishing lodges dot the main shoreline and can also be found on several of Nipissing&#x27;s many islands. Most anglers target walleye, smallmouth bass, muskie, and northern pike. For various reasons, largely social, numerous stocking associations are engaged in attempts to manage the lake&#x27;s walleye population.

In the days of fur trade, coureur des bois and later voyageurs travelled through the lake by canoe via the Mattawa and French rivers. When the fur trade started to decline in the 1880s, logging became the main economic activity. After World War I, the primary economic activity became tourism and recreation, although logging still contributes a significant economic stimulus to the area.

Unlike most lakes in Ontario, Lake Nipissing contains two volcanic pipes, which are the Manitou Islands and Callander Bay. The volcanic pipes formed by the violent, supersonic eruption of deep-origin volcanoes. Lake Nipissing lies in the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, a Mesozoic era rift valley that formed 175 million years ago.

==Flora and fauna==
The lake is home to an abundance of flora and fauna:
white pine is significant, however, broadleaf trees such as aspen, ash, birch, maple and oak predominate some of the larger islands. Juniper, sumac, scrub oak, oak ferns and poison ivy can also be found. As well as much prized fish species, Nipissing wildlife includes moose, beaver, bald eagle, ospreys and turtles.

===Flora===
The lakeshore and islands are densely covered with broadleaved trees. Some of the larger islands on the lake such as Garden Island are almost exclusively broadleaf with maple, oak and dogwood. Many trees species can be found on and around the lake including:
* White pine which dominates the smaller rocky islands on the lake.
* Ash (black, mountain, red and white)
* Aspen (trembling and largetooth)
* Beech
* Birch (white and yellow)
* Dogwood
* Elm
* Ironwood
* Maple (silver, striped and sugar)
* Oak (burr and red)

===Fauna===
Fish - the lake is famous for the plethora of fish and the sport they provide. Of the 44 fish species to be found in Lake Nipissing, the significant include:
* Northern pike
* Muskie (clear or barred and spotted)
* Walleye
* Gar
* Smallmouth bass
* Yellow perch
* Cisco or lake herring
* Whitefish
* Burbot
* two species deemed to be &#x27;at risk&#x27; by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; the northern brook lamprey and lake sturgeon

Mammals - Many mammals frequent the shores and islands of the lake, including:
* Moose
* Wolf
* Black bear
* Marten
* Fisher
* Red squirrel
* Chipmunk
* Beaver
* Muskrat
* Hare

Birds - These separate naturally into resident or visiting species, including:

<text>A pulse in signal processing is a rapid, transient change in the amplitude of a signal from a baseline value to a higher or lower value, followed by a rapid return to the baseline value.

==Pulse shapes==
Pulse shapes can arise out of a process called pulse-shaping. Optimum pulse shape depends on the application.

===Rectangular pulse===
These can be found in pulse waves, square waves, boxcar functions, and rectangular functions. In digital signals the up and down transitions between high and low levels are called the rising edge and the falling edge. In digital systems the detection of these sides or action taken in response is termed edge-triggered, rising or falling depending on which side of rectangular pulse. A digital timing diagram is an example of a well-ordered collection of rectangular pulses.

===Nyquist pulse===
A Nyquist pulse is one which meets the Nyquist ISI criterion and is important in data transmission. An example of a pulse which meets this condition is the sinc function. The sinc pulse is of some significance in signal-processing theory but cannot be produced by a real generator for reasons of causality.

In 2013, Nyquist pulses were produced in an effort to reduce the size of pulses in optical fibers, which enables them to be packed 10 times more closely together, yielding a corresponding 10-fold increase in bandwidth. The pulses were more than 99 percent perfect and were produced using a simple laser and modulator.

===Dirac pulse===
A Dirac pulse has the shape of the Dirac delta function. It has the properties of infinite amplitude and its integral is the Heaviside step function. Equivalently, it has zero width and an area under the curve of unity. This is another pulse that cannot be created exactly in real systems, but practical approximations can be achieved. It is used in testing, or theoretically predicting, the impulse response of devices and systems, particularly filters. Such responses yield a great deal of information about the system.

===Gaussian pulse===
A Gaussian pulse is shaped as a Gaussian function and is produced by the impulse response of a Gaussian filter. It has the properties of maximum steepness of transition with no overshoot and minimum group delay.

<text>In music theory, the pulse is a series of uniformly spaced beats—either audible or implied—that sets the tempo and is the scaffolding for the rhythm. By contrast, rhythm is always audible and can depart from the pulse. So while the rhythm may become too difficult for an untrained listener to fully match, nearly any listener instinctively matches the pulse by simply tapping uniformly, despite rhythmic variations in timing of sounds alongside the pulse.

==Definitions==

&lt;br&gt;

The tempo is the speed of the pulse. If a pulse becomes too fast it would become a drone; one that is too slow would be perceived as unconnected sounds. When the period of any continuous beat is faster than 8–10 per second or slower than 1 per 1.5–2 seconds, it cannot be perceived as such. &quot;Musical&quot; pulses are generally specified in the range 40–240 beats per minute. The pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as basic. This is currently most often designated as a crotchet (quarter note) when written (see time signature).

Pulse is related to and distinguished from rhythm (grouping), beats, and meter:

==Pulse groups==
While ideal pulses are identical, when pulses are variously accented, this produces two- or three-pulse pulse groups such as strong–weak and strong–weak–weak and any longer group may be broken into such groups of two and three. In fact there is a natural tendency to perceptually group or differentiate an ideal pulse in this way. A repetitive, regularly accented pulse-group is called a metre. 

Pulses can occur at multiple metric levels – see figure. Pulse groups may be distinguished as synchronous, if all pulses on slower levels coincide with those on faster levels, and nonsynchronous, if not.

An isochronal or equally spaced pulse on one level that uses varied pulse groups (rather than just one pulse group the whole piece) create a pulse on the (slower) multiple level that is non-isochronal (a stream of 2+3... at eighth-note level would create a pulse of a quarter note+dotted quarter note as its multiple level).

<doc id="527792" wikidata="Q3083289" url="?curid=527792" title="La Presse">
<text>is a French-language online newspaper published daily in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1884, it is now owned by an independent nonprofit trust.

&#x27; was formerly a broadsheet daily, considered a [[newspaper of record]] in Canada. Its Sunday edition was discontinued in 2009, and the weekday edition in 2016. The weekend Saturday printed edition was discontinued on 31 December 2017, turning&#x27; into an entirely online newspaper.

==Audience and sections==
&#x27; is published on its website, .ca, and its mobile app, . The newspaper targets an educated, middle-class readership. Its main competitors are two Montreal print dailies, the tabloid-format &#x27;, which aims at a more populist audience, and the more left-leaning broadsheet .

&quot; comprises several sections, dealing individually with arts, sports, business and economy and other themes. Its Saturday print edition (now discontinued) contained over 10 sections.

The newspaper&#x27;s archives from 2000 to 2019 are available on its website.

==History==

The paper was founded on October 20, 1884 by William-Edmond Blumhart. Trefflé Berthiaume took over in 1889. The fledgling newspaper&#x27;s circulation would soon pass that of its main competitor of the time, &quot;&quot;.

In April 1901, the paper organized a cruise to Quebec City (&#x27;). It also organized a charity to give Christmas gifts to poor children (&#x27;).

A front-page illustration on December 3, 1904, issue celebrated the 50th anniversary of the proclamation of the Roman Catholic dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The practice of the time was to have an illustration on the front page, rather than a photograph.

Between July 1971 and February 1972, &#x27; endured a seven-month labour dispute between its then-owner Power Corporation of Canada and 11 trade unions, prompted by the introduction of new printing technology that could have jeopardized the jobs of newspaper typographers. This resulted in &#x27; not being printed between October 28, 1971, and February 9, 1972. The dispute culminated in an over-10,000-strong protest in Downtown Montreal on October 29, 1971, resulting in over 200 injuries and arrests, as well as the death of the 28-year-old Michèle Gauthier, a student at , who was caught up in the protests.

The style and presentation of the print newspaper changed immensely during the course of the 20th century. It underwent complete graphic redesigns in 1986 and 2003.

From 1984 to 2014, &#x27; every year honoured a &quot;Person of the Year&quot;, for example, Julie Payette, Daniel Langlois and Gaétan Boucher. In 1984, it also published a commemorative book in order to celebrate its 100th anniversary. A similar book was published by &#x27; to recap the major events of the 20th century.

In 2001, with the arrival of news editor Guy Crevier, the newspaper began a radical remodelling. The graphic design was modernized, new sections were created, international coverage was greatly increased, and many new young, up-and-coming journalists were hired. These changes had a significant positive impact on quality and circulation, to the point that the paper is now considered a rival to for the title of Quebec&#x27;s newspaper of record.

In 2011, &#x27; rebranded its new-media operations from .ca to .ca. In 2013, the newspaper launched &#x27;, a free digital edition for iPad.

Founded in May 2015, Nuglif is a subsidiary of &#x27; and the platform aims at replicating the &#x27; business model for other publications in the daily news industry through a suite of publishing software and tools for delivery on both iPads and Android tablets.

The newspaper announced in September 2015 that it would end its weekday print edition in 2016 and that thereafter the weekday paper would be available only in digital form. The Saturday edition continued in print until December 30, 2017.

On May 8, 2018, it was announced that &quot; would become a non-profit organization and sever ties with its owner, Power Corporation. This move allowed the newspaper to accept private donations and governmental support.

In March 2024, La Presse apologized for posting an anti-Semitic cartoon relating to the Israel-Hamas war 

==Editorial line==

The editorial board of &quot; has been consistently supportive of Canadian federalism over the past 25 years, though individual columnists may freely express less sympathy. The newspaper&#x27;s editorials endorsed the federalist option in both the 1980 Quebec referendum and the 1995 Quebec referendum which were held on the issue of Quebec&#x27;s national sovereignism.

The editorial board leaves room for the whole spectrum of opinions. It supported same-sex marriage legislation in Canada, the protests against the War in Iraq, and criticized both sides in the 2012 Quebec student protests. The paper endorsed the Conservative Party in the 2006 election. This was primarily out of a reasoning that the Canadian government was in need of a necessary change after more than 12 years of Liberal rule. Similarly, with Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives having been in power for nine years at the time, &quot; endorsed Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party in the 2015 election.

Guy Crevier is currently the editor, and François Cardinal is the assistant editor. Noted journalists associated with the paper include Patrick Lagacé, Yves Boisvert, Agnès Gruda and Lysiane Gagnon.

==Television==
The newspaper&#x27;s television production arm, &#x27;, has produced the series &#x27;, hosted by former politician Mario Dumont, for the Quebec television network V (formerly TQS). The division, which had changed its name to &quot;&quot;, was sold to Attraction Images in 2014.

<doc id="527808" wikidata="Q184023" url="?curid=527808" title="Tarbes">
<text>Tarbes (; Gascon: &quot;Tarba&quot;) is a commune in the Hautes-Pyrénées department in the Occitanie region of southwestern France. It is the capital of Bigorre and of the Hautes-Pyrénées. It has been a commune since 1790. It was known as &quot;Turba&quot; or &quot;Tarba&quot; in Roman times. Tarbes is part of the historical region of Gascony.

Formerly of strong industrial tradition, Tarbes today tries to diversify its activities, particularly in aeronautics and high tech around the different zones of activities which are increasing. The recent development of Tarbais beans and other regional specialties also shows a willingness to develop the agri-food industry thus justifying its nickname of &quot;market town&quot;. Its 42,888 inhabitants are called &quot;Tarbaises&quot; and the &quot;Tarbais&quot;.

It is the seat of the diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes. The 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment and 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment are stationed in Tarbes.

==Geography==

===Location===

Tarbes is a Pre-Pyrenees town within the rich agricultural plain of the river Adour, southwest of Toulouse, to the east of Bayonne, southwest of Auch and northeast of Lourdes. Tarbes is 1 hr 30 mins from the Atlantic Ocean, 2 hrs 50 mins from the Languedoc coast and 35 minutes from the nearest ski resorts. It is located at an average elevation of .

To the south of Tarbes, along with the pilgrimage town of Lourdes, is the border with Spain. The Pyrenees mountains, lying along the border between France and Spain, can be seen from the town.

===Hydrography===
Tarbes is crossed to the east by the Adour river and to the west by the Échez and by the Gespe, a tributary which joins the Échez on the territory of the commune.

===Neighbouring communes===


===Climate===
Tarbes features an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb), with relatively hot summers, mild winters and abundant rainfall. Tarbes benefits from its privileged location in the area of the Adour, a milder microclimate than at Lourdes, from a higher altitude, and somewhat less rainy than in Pau, and sunnier. Summers are warm and often stormy, while spring is rainy and cool and autumn is mild and sunny. Winter, meanwhile, is less rigorous but can still hold some surprises. The lowest temperature was recorded in January 1985 with a temperature under shelter of . Conversely, there was a maximum temperature of in August 2003.

==Toponymy==
The name of the town was recorded in the 5th century as &quot;Civitas Turba ubi castrum Bigòrra&quot; (The town of Turba (possibly &#x27;of the crowd&#x27;) where the castle of Bigòrra is located). It was an important town in Novempopulania, one of the Roman provinces at that time. In the 6th century Gregory of Tours referred to it as &quot;Talvam vicum&quot;. In the Middle Ages it was called &quot;Tarbé&quot; (1214), &quot;Tursa&quot;, &quot;Tarvia&quot; (1284) and also &quot;Tarbia&quot;. Not to be confused with the Tarbelli, whose capital was Dax.

===Legendary origin of the name===
Legend holds that the Queen of Ethiopia, Tarbis, proposed her love to Moses and that he refused. Inconsolable, she decided to leave her throne and hide her disappointment. After many wanderings, she arrived in Bigorre and built her home on the Adour to found the town of Tarbes, and its sister, on the banks of the Gave de Pau, arose as Lourdes.

==History==

===Antiquity===
In the 3rd century BC, the foundations of Tarbes began to emerge, based on the testimonies of the exhumed remains which had been buried. By need for salt trade, merchants who were likely Aquitanians travelled across the Pyrenean foothills. To continue their journey, they had to use a ford in order to cross the Adour which descended from the mountain. It was more prudent to split the loads to cross the ford as a result of which a pause was necessary. The bottom of the valley was dominated by a sandy emergence which prompted people to settle there.

Then, &quot;Tarba&quot; experienced a Roman colonisation and acquired ancient villas and large agricultural estates, found particularly in the Ormeau quarter. The existence of craft has been verified by the remains of the workshops of potters and weavers. The urban core, meanwhile, assumed the administrative functions and would have had an early Christian church in the 4th century.

===Middle Ages===

In the 5th and 6th centuries, as a result of the barbarian invasions which swept in successive waves, the city shrank around the castrum, of which a remnant remains in the rear courtyard of the prefecture.

In about 840 AD, the Vikings led a devastating raid following which the Bishop of Bigorre reported that the city Bigorre was beginning with the cathedral, named with originality, &quot;la Sède&quot;.

At the end of the 12th century, the count of Bigorre settled in his castle of Tarbes, resulting with the court of justice being in his suite. Then, the capital of Bigorre received a Royal Seneschal.

Two noble houses were founded in the 13th century, outside the walls, one the convent of the Cordeliers near &quot;Carrère Longue&quot;, the other being that of the Carmelites in the vicinity of the Bourg Crabé.

At the end of the medieval centuries, the city was composed of six separate fortified towns, juxtaposed and aligned on an east–west axis, where the original core was ordered around the cathedral. There were thus la Sède, Carrère, Maubourguet and Bourg Vieux flanked to the east of the Count&#x27;s castle, with Bourg Neuf and Bourg Crabé each surrounded by their own walls.

During the Wars of Religion, in 1569, the troops of Jeanne d&#x27;Albret burned the cathedral, the convents and other churches as well as the bishopric. Despite the strategic destruction to try to defend Bourg Vieux, the inhabitants were massacred.

===Early Modern era===
In the 17th century, after the plague and the problems of housing people of war, Tarbes ensured its revival with the reconstruction of the Episcopal Palace in 1652 (today the office of the prefecture), the foundation of a third hospital in 1690 and two new convents (Capuchins and Ursulines). Irrigation of the land and the water power used by the craftsmen were produced by the system of canals derived from the Adour.

The 18th century announced a growth of the population, and the development of agriculture, crafts and trade. The town expanded and new quarters appeared (such as the current &quot;Rue Maréchal-Foch&quot;). Then, the Constituent Assembly, which included Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac (Deputy of Bigorre to the Estates-General), decided to undertake administrative reform and Tarbes benefitted by becoming capital of the department of the Hautes-Pyrénées.

===19th century===


====Prerogatives of a chef-lieu====
From 1800, Tarbes became the chef-lieu and headquarters of a prefecture (an increase of its administrative role and its functions). In 1806, Napoleon I re-established the and Tarbes gave birth to the Anglo-Arabian horse breed. In 1859, Tarbes was connected to Paris by rail.

====Legacy====
In the 19th century, various legacies enrich the public spaces of Tarbes. In 1853, bequeathed to the city the eponymous garden, still unfinished. In 1877, a donation by the former Mayor Antoine Brauhauban was responsible for the construction of an imposing hall which bore his name (this building was destroyed in 1970 to establish outdoor parking). The end of the 19th century still saw the construction of the two fountains of &quot;Place Marcadieu&quot;, a legacy of the benefactor Félicitée Duvignau.

====Industrial development====
After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, General Verchère de Reffye transformed the experimental workshop of Meudon, which was transferred by train to Tarbes, into a fully-fledged artillery workshop (called an arsenal by the townspeople). Thus, Tarbes became an industrial and working-class town but also asserted its military vocation by the construction of the Larrey, Soult and Reffye neighbourhoods. Today &quot;Les Forges de Tarbes&quot; still produce artillery shells for the French Army&#x27;s Leclerc MBT and CAESAR self-propelled howitzer.

===Political trends and results===
The municipal history of Tarbes under the Fifth Republic was marked by several waves.

In the elections of 1959, the outgoing Socialist mayor, Marcel Billières, was a victim of the resilience of the Communist Party but especially also the shift to the right, which managed to seize the city hall with the election of Paul Boyrie. He was comfortably re-elected in 1965 (58.4%) and 1971 (55.2%). However, his sudden death a few weeks before the 1977 elections caused confusion in the ranks of the outgoing majority.

In this election, the Communist prevailed in the first round (50.6%), at the head of a list of union of the left. He was reelected in 1983 with 54.8% against Jean Journé (UDF-RPR), but took ill with a heart attack during the count. Raymond Erracarret (FCP) was elected mayor by the municipal council. The new councillor regained his chair in 1989 with 54.1% against Jean Journé (UDF-RPR), then with a reduced majority (51.3%) in 1995, against Gérard Trémège (UDF-RPR).

2001 then marked a brand new change: Gérard Trémège, after a merger of the lists of DL-UDF and RPR, became mayor with 50.1% of the vote (26 votes in advance). He was re-elected on 17 March 2008 under the UMP-Radical Party label &quot;Valoisien&quot; this time with 54.3% (1,705 votes ahead of Jean Glavany) and again on 23 March 2014, this time in the first round with 52.95% of the votes.

==Outstanding public buildings and places==

===Public buildings===
The city hall and the courthouse, classical buildings of the 19th century, adjoin the &quot;Rue Maréchal-Foch&quot;. Built in 1907, it is denoted by its candid monumentality. It is surmounted by a bell tower and faces the &quot;Place Jean-Jaurès&quot; enthroned with a statue of Danton. On the façade, one can read the motto &quot;Concord, liberty, equality, fraternity, labour.&quot; The Hôtel Brauhauban, an 18th-century mansion, is one of its annexes.

Not far away, the Police headquarters occupies two mansions built on the north walls filled in the 18th century to give birth to the current &quot;Rue Georges-Clemenceau&quot;. The Academy of Inspection of Hautes-Pyrénées occupies a former school, built at the end of the 19th century.

In the La Sède quarter, the was housed in the old Episcopal Palace, rebuilt in the 17th century. Not far away, lies the old college of Tarbes which became the Lycée Impérial in 1853 and was renamed Lycée Théophile Gautier in 1911. The Council General of Hautes-Pyrénées also has several buildings including the former seminary of priests of the 18th century. The departmental archives are housed in a remarkable building from 1936.

Three places are devoted to the markets: The market hall and the &quot;Place Marcadieu&quot;, Brauhauban market hall and the &quot;Place du Foirail&quot;. Near the Brauhauban market hall is an Italian theatre, known as the &quot;Théâtre des Nouveautés&quot;, which was built in 1885.

===Fountains and squares===
The city has many fountains. The &quot;Place Marcadieu&quot; and &quot;Place Verdun&quot; reproduce the same pattern: They each have two fountains spread at either ends and not in the middle.

Félicité Duvignau initiated this peculiarity, in &quot;Place Marcadieu&quot;, by bequest wishing for the building of fountains at each end of this vast esplanade. This relates to an eponymous Baltard-type market hall building in 1883. Inaugurated in 1897, the monumental fountain of the Quatre-Vallées, combining cast iron and sculpture, figures the valleys of Bagnères, Aure, Argelès and the plain of Tarbes. At the other end of the square, the more modest &quot;Source de l&#x27;amour&quot; [Source of love], presents an echo of the style.

The Montaut fountain is set at the centre of this public space and was moved close to the square of the same name. Named after its donor, it is carved in stone by Nelli of the Pyrenees and was first erected in 1874.

In 2008, the ensemble was further complemented by the construction of a nearby square planted with palm trees, in the north of its namesake Sainte-Thérèse Church.

The Place de Verdun has fountains of a much more contemporary appearance. To the south, the &quot;Grande Fontaine&quot; [Great Fountain] forms a playful bell of water. It is assisted in the north by the &quot;Droits de l&#x27;Enfant&quot; [Rights of the Child] fountain, where a water jet raises a ball which can be rotated by only the force of the wrist.

The Alhambra fountain, a replica of the mythical Alhambra fountain in Granada, Spain. The fountain is located at 43 &quot;Rue Maréchal-Foch&quot; in an open-air shopping area. Around the fountain is a landscaping of greenery.

The &quot;Fontaine de l&#x27;Inondation&quot; [Fountain of the Flood] which was installed in the &quot;Place de Verdun&quot; in 1901 was relocated, in 1934, to the &quot;Place de la Courteboule&quot; in the Soult quarter. It features a family and its goat fleeing the waters contained therein. This is an allusion to the flood of 1875.

Other fountains can also be mentioned such as the one of the &quot;Cours Reffye&quot;, the one in &quot;Place Saint-Jean&quot; and that of La Gespe in the &quot;Place André-Guerlain&quot;.

===Military heritage===
The is composed of an park with Empire-syle buildings including the Maison du Cheval. It was created by Napoleon in 1806 and is the birthplace of a refined breed of horses, the Anglo-Arabian, which are provided to the regiments of hussars. The buildings were built with mostly local materials: Grey marmorifere stone, pebbles of the Adour, bricks and slates. It has a riding school and stables including boxes and with a set of remarkable chestnut panelled ceilings.

During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Jean-Baptiste Verchère de Reffye establishes, in the old store of tobacco in Tarbes, an artillery workshop commonly referred to as &quot;Arsenal&quot;. It was used for military armament production until 2006. The site is today turning towards the tertiary sector. The old tobacco store houses the Municipal Archives and the Massey Museum reserves. In front stands the House of associations and its bell tower.

The development of the Larrey, Soult and Reffye quarters saw the assertion of the military role of Tarbes in the 19th and 20th centuries. Several barracks were built. With regard to the Larrey barracks (1825), the majesty of the central building, long and flanked by two side buildings, is reinforced by the existence of an accessible courtyard from a portal framed by two pavilions of neoclassical inspiration. The ensemble is located in the axis of the Leclerc martial walkways which concentrate memorials including the monumental equestrian statue of Marshal Foch erected in 1935. is represented riding Marboré, a horse owned by the Fould family.

The Reffye high school is an old military barracks surrendered by the army after World War II.

===Industrial remains===
The former site of the Arsenal has been renovated to accommodate shops, places of leisure (cinema, a second bowling facility, laser quest, restaurants, etc.), municipal or community buildings (archives, maison des associations, business, etc.) and companies. The industrial architecture of the place is preserved. Its genesis took place in 1871 with Jean-Baptiste Verchère de Reffye as the main protagonist. Its industrial deterioration occurred following the 2003 announcement of the closure of the GIAT site, heir to the arsenal of 1871.

This area is adjacent, in Aureilhan, to the Oustau ceramic factory which was founded in 1873 by . The factory buildings, abundantly decorated with glazed bricks, were protected as an Historic Monument in 1994.

Repeatedly devastated during the Wars of Religion, its structure, dating from the 15th century, remains marked by the &quot;Gothique méridional&quot; trend. In the Middle Ages, the building played a major role in the city and the States of Bigorre met there. The church houses a remarkable organ and many Baroque chapels. The high altar is a work of Jean Brunello. The Neo-Romanesque bell tower dates from the 17th century.

Of Languedoc Gothic style, the Sainte-Thérèse Church is opposite the market halls and the &quot;Place Marcadieu&quot;. Its history began with the establishment of the Carmelites in the 13th century. The bell tower, which is one of the oldest items, dates from the 15th century and is a remnant of the ancient abbey. The church was, however, largely renovated in the 19th century by the architect of the city, Claude Tiffon. It houses an organ, Baroque statues and several paintings of Raymond-Marc Lagarrigue.

The Church of Saint-Antoine was constructed, near the site of the Arsenal, in 1896. It is thus to link to the past workers of this parish who were Conventual Franciscans.

The Church of Saint-Martin, the Sainte-Bernadette Church and the Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Church, which is pyramid-shaped, are of contemporary architecture.

Other fine examples of Bigorre houses are visible on the &quot;Rue de la Victoire&quot;, &quot;Rue Clémenceau&quot; and also &quot;Rue Regiment-de-Bigorre&quot;. They are recognisable by their carved wooden doors, their coloured plaster frames which enhance grey marmorifere stone, with their wooden roofed balconies and their slate roofs pierced by skylights.

Opposite the Saint-Jean Church, the birthplace of Bertrand Barère is visible.

At the mercy of the movements of his father, Théophile Gautier was also born in &quot;Rue Brauhauban&quot;. The house is still visible today. The family, however, lived there for only three years. The &quot;Rue Brauhauban&quot; is also home to the birthplace of another poet of the 19th century, Laurent Tailhade.

English Imperial style or even villas dating from the 19th and 20th centuries, adorn the Massey Garden, the Bel Air Park, the Paul Chastellain Park and their respective quarters. The Villa Massey, in the heart of its namesake garden, is Neo-Moorish (19th century). Villa Fould, formerly the residence of Baron Achille Fould, Minister of State of Napoleon III, has been restored.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney PW6000 is a high-bypass turbofan jet engine designed for the Airbus A318 with a design thrust range of .

==Design and development==
Pratt &amp; Whitney designed the engine with minimum complexity to significantly reduce maintenance costs and achieve weight and fuel consumption savings. However, tests revealed that the initial five-stage high compressor based design did not meet promised fuel burn performance. As a result, many of the original customers switched their orders to the rival CFM56-5. To address the problem, Pratt &amp; Whitney re-certified an updated design utilizing a six-stage high compressor designed by MTU Aero Engines in order to achieve promised performance. The German company manufactured the high-pressure compressor and the low-pressure turbine. The HP compressor is driven by a single-stage turbine. On the LP spool a three-stage turbine drives a single-stage fan and a four-stage LP compressor.

The engine made its first flight August 21, 2000 on a test aircraft flown from Plattsburgh International Airport (KPBG), successfully completing a 1-hour-20-minute flight. The engine final assembly line is located at MTU Aero Engines at their location in Hanover, Germany.

LAN Airlines confirmed an order for 15 Airbus A318 aircraft, for a total of 34 engines (30 installed and 4 spares) powered by PW-6000 engines on 15 August 2005. In addition, LAN signed with Pratt and Whitney to power up to 25 option aircraft. If LAN exercises all options it would mean an additional 56 (50 installed and six spare) engines.

Prior to the LAN order, 84 CFM56-5 powered Airbus A318 aircraft had been ordered, with 28 currently in service .

<doc id="527823" wikidata="Q5630425" url="?curid=527823" title="HMAS Lae (P 93)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Lae&quot; (P 93) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). It was named for the city of Lae, capital of Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. Completed in 1968, the vessel was one of five assigned to the RAN&#x27;s Papua New Guinea (PNG) Division. The patrol boat was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in 1974 as HMPNGS &quot;Lae&quot;. She remained in service until 1988.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, fourteen were ordered for the RAN, five of which were intended for the Papua New Guinea Division of the RAN, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Lae&quot; was built by Walkers Limited of Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 5 October 1967, and commissioned on 3 April 1968.

==Operational history==
Primary roles of the new patrol boats were fisheries protection and sea training, but also undertook search and rescue, medical evacuation and monitoring of navigational aids roles. The ship&#x27;s company was made up of both Australian and PNG servicemen. Prior to the arrival of the &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats, surveillance of PNG waters was conducted by small coastal craft and occasional visits by larger RAN warships, but the PNG Division was now able to chase and apprehend vessels suspected of illegal fishing. The first arrest of a foreign fishing vessel by the new patrol boats was made by &quot;Lae&quot; in November 1968 when they responded to a radio report and surprised the Taiwanese &quot;Chin Hong Ming&quot;. The vessel was boarded and escorted to Medang.

In January 1970, &quot;Lae&quot; responded to rescue operations in the Whitsunday Islands when they were hit by Cyclone Ada. Over three days, the patrol boat battle large seas delivering medical supplies to islands and evacuating injured people, including tourists from Hayman Island at the height of the storm. The vessel&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant John Scott, RAN, was awarded an MBE for leadership during the rescue efforts, while two other personnel, CPO Kenneth William Matters and RO J Sehi were awarded the BEM.

While on patrol in July 1970, &quot;Lae&quot; struck a shallow reef and was pulled off with the aid of sister ships &quot;Aitape&quot; and &quot;Samarai&quot;, fortunately suffering little damage.

&quot;Lae&quot; was one of the five &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats of the RAN PNG Division transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force&#x27;s (PNGDF) Maritime Element (now Maritime Operations Element) on 14 November 1974 when the PNGDF took over maritime functions from the RAN. They formed the PNGDF Patrol Boat Squadron based at Manus. &quot;Lae&quot; was decommissioned in 1988.

<text>The State University of New York at Cortland (SUNY Cortland, C-State, or Cortland State) is a public university in Cortland, New York. It was founded in 1868 and is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.

==History==
The State University of New York Cortland was founded in 1868 as the Cortland Normal School. Among its earliest students included inventor and industrialist Elmer A. Sperry of Sperry Rand Corp.

In 1941, by an action made by the Board of Regents, the institution became a four-year college known as the “Cortland State Teachers College,” where students could earn a bachelor’s degree. In 1948, Cortland was a founding member of the State University of New York. In 1961, thirteen years later, the college was officially renamed as the State University of New York College at Cortland.

On January 1, 2023, the State University of New York changed the name of the college from State University of New York College at Cortland to the State University of New York at Cortland.

==Campus==
Cortland is off of Interstate 81, between Syracuse and Binghamton. The college&#x27;s main campus covers , and includes 30 traditional and modern buildings. Fourteen of these structures are residence halls that provide housing for approximately 3,000 students. SUNY Cortland also operates its Outdoor Education Center at Raquette Lake in the Adirondacks, the Hoxie Gorge Nature Preserve outside Cortland, and the Brauer Education Center on the Helderberg Escarpment near Albany.

The U.S. Department of the Interior in 2004 designated Camp Pine Knot, now known as the Huntington Memorial Camp and part of its Outdoor Education center at Raquette Lake, as the first and only National Historic Landmark within the State University of New York (SUNY). Camp Pine Knot was the first Great Camp of the Adirondacks and the birthplace of what is now known as the Adirondack style of architecture. SUNY Cortland has 55,000 alumni who live in all 50 states and in more than 40 countries.

==Organization and administration==
Cortland is a comprehensive college within the State University of New York system.

==Academics==
Today, approximately 6,800 students are pursuing degrees within the college&#x27;s three academic divisions—arts and sciences, education and professional studies. Twenty-eight academic departments with a faculty of more than 600 offer the SUNY Cortland student body 50 majors and 38 minors from which to choose, plus 33 graduate majors and four certificates of advanced study.

==Student life==
SUNY Cortland has over 100 student clubs.

In 2015, the school opened a $56 million Student Life Center (SLC). The SLC covers more than and includes a three-court gymnasium, a swimming pool, indoor running track, rock climbing wall, dining bistro, table tennis room, game room, combatives room, various exercise spaces, a golf simulator, and cardio and weight training equipment.

===Athletics===

The Cortland Red Dragons are the athletic teams for SUNY Cortland. The college competes in NCAA Division III in the State University of New York Athletic Conference for most sports. Football played in the New Jersey Athletic Conference from 2000 to 2014, and became an affiliate member of the Empire 8 in 2015. Wrestling competes in the Empire Collegiate Wrestling Conference, the women&#x27;s ice hockey team competes in the ECAC West, women&#x27;s gymnastics is a National Collegiate Gymnastics Association (NCGA) East member, and women&#x27;s golf is an independent, as those sports are not offered by the SUNYAC.

SUNY Cortland has had the most regional successful men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics program in New York over the past two decades. In 1995, the Sears Directors&#x27; Cup was established to gauge and recognize the most successful intercollegiate athletics programs in the nation. SUNY Cortland is one of only five colleges and universities in the U.S. to have finished every year among the Top 25 NCAA Division III programs. Cortland placed 12th out of approximately 440 schools during the 2015–16 competition that is now known as the Learfield Sports Directors&#x27; Cup. The competition is sponsored by USA Today, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, and Learfield Sports. The standings are based on schools&#x27; national finishes in different sports.

The Cortland Red Dragons annually play Ithaca College Bombers for the Cortaca Jug, which was added in 1959 to an already competitive rivalry. The match-up is one of the most prominent in Division III college football. It was called the &quot;biggest little game in the nation&quot; by Sports Illustrated in 1991. The Red Dragons had a seven-game winning streak as of November 2016, but lost 48–20 in 2017. They also play the Cortaca Mic game every Friday before the Cortaca Jug game. Which is played between the Ithaca (WICB) and Cortland (WSUC) school radio stations. Cortland has never lost this game since it has been played.

Cortland also plays rival SUNY school Oswego each year for the &quot;Dragon Sword&quot; in Women&#x27;s Field Hockey. The sword was donated by Oswego alumni Kimberlee (Bennett) and Michael Champitto and began play annually in 1999. As of 2021 Cortland has never failed to capture the sword at this event.

Cortland snapped Salisbury University&#x27;s 69-game win streak to capture the 2006 NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Div. III National Championship. The team reached the 2007 and 2008 national championship in rematch games against Salisbury University. The lacrosse team cemented its spot as a premier team with its second Division III national championship in 2009, defeating Gettysburg in the finals.

In 2006 as part of its Silver Anniversary of sponsoring women&#x27;s sports, the NCAA named the SUNY Cortland women&#x27;s cross country program as its top cross country program of the past 25 years. The Cortland women captured seven NCAA Division III national championships in a nine-year span between 1989 and 1997 (1989, 1991–95, 1997). In addition, the Cortland men&#x27;s cross country team won the 2008 NCAA Div. III championship.

In all, Cortland teams have won 25 national titles, including 18 NCAA crowns. Along with the titles mentioned above, the field hockey team won NCAA Div. III titles in 1993, 1994 and 2001, the women&#x27;s outdoor track and field team won an NCAA Div. III title in 1985 and the women&#x27;s indoor track and field team was the 1991 NCAA Div. III champion. The men&#x27;s lacrosse squad won the NCAA Div. II title in 1975 and the USILA College Division championship in 1973. The women&#x27;s soccer won the 1992 NCAA Div. III tournament and captured the first-ever U.S. National Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship in 1980, defeating UCLA in the finals. The men&#x27;s gymnastics team won USGF Div. II-III titles in 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990. The baseball and Women&#x27;s Lacrosse teams each won their first ever Div. III titles in 2015. The women&#x27;s lacrosse team won 18 SUNYAC titles between 1997 and 2015. 

The Men&#x27;s Football team won its first NCAA Division III National Championship in 2023.

Cortland previously hosted the summer training camp of the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets from 2009 to 2014, except for 2011 due to the NFL lockout.

===International Exchange Program===
SUNY Cortland has 18 partner universities across the world such as the German Sport University Cologne and the Griffith University in Australia.

<doc id="527839" wikidata="Q3182160" url="?curid=527839" title="John Neilson (Lower Canada politician)">
<text>John Neilson (July 17, 1776 – February 1, 1848) was a journalist, publisher and politician in Lower Canada (now Quebec). Born in Scotland, he emigrated to Lower Canada in 1791 at age 15, to work in his older brother&#x27;s publishing company in Quebec City. On his brother&#x27;s death a few years later, he inherited the business. Neilson became one of the leading publishers and booksellers in Lower Canada and in Upper Canada (now Ontario), selling books in both French and English. He was the editor of the newspaper &quot;La Gazette de Québec / The Quebec Gazette&quot;, published in French and in English.

Once well-established financially, Neilson entered politics. Elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada as a supporter of the &quot;Parti canadien&quot;, he became a strong opponent to the provincial government under the governors appointed by the British government. He argued for greater control of the provincial government by the elected Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. In 1823, he and Louis-Joseph Papineau travelled to London to argue against a proposal to merge Lower Canada with Upper Canada. In 1828, he was part of another delegation to London, to make submissions criticizing the financial controls of the governors. Although an ally of some of the leading French-Canadian politicians, such as Papineau, he gradually split with them as they became increasingly more radical during the 1830s. He opposed the Lower Canada Rebellion which broke out in 1837.

The result of the rebellion was that the two provinces were merged into a single province, the Province of Canada. In 1841, Neilson was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the new Parliament of the Province of Canada, where he opposed the union. He was defeated in the general election of 1844, but then was named by the governor to the Legislative Council, the appointed upper house of the Parliament. He held that position for the rest of his life.

== Family and early life ==

Neilson was born in Dornal in the parish of Balmaghie, Scotland, in 1776, son of William Neilson and Isabel Brown. In 1791, he emigrated to Quebec City, Lower Canada, to work for his older brother, Samuel Neilson, who was operating the newspaper and publishing company of their deceased maternal uncle, William Brown. John Neilson formally inherited the business in 1793 when his brother Samuel died. Because he himself was underage, Neilson was under the tutelage of a Presbyterian minister, Alexander Spark, until reaching the age of majority and being able to acquire full control of the business. In one burst of youthful exuberance, he went to New York without permission, but duly apologised to Spark on his return.

In 1797, he married Marie-Ursule Hubert, a niece of Jean-François Hubert, Bishop of Quebec. The marriage ceremony was conducted by an Anglican priest in the presence of a Roman Catholic priest. The couple signed a notarial marriage contract, governed by the &quot;coutume de Paris&quot;, the French law in force in Lower Canada. He explained in a letter to his mother that he wished to show that he had permanently established himself in Lower Canada, and provide an example that Canadians and British immigrants could live together. The couple had ten children, with their sons raised Presbyterians, and their daughters raised Catholic.

== Business career: publishing, bookselling, landholdings==

Neilson steadily developed the printing and book-selling business until he was the leading printer and bookseller in Lower Canada, with major links to Upper Canada. He published the &quot;Quebec Gazette/La Gazette de Québec&quot; in English and French. It was the largest circulation newspaper in the two Canadas, and expanded when he imported special types and presses for his business. He showed strong abilities in business, particularly in keeping detailed track of his finances and accounting. He would go to court if necessary to ensure payments of his accounts, but preferred to rely on personal relations and private arbitrations in financial disputes. According to his rival James Brown of Montreal, Neilson&#x27;s publishing house was &quot;the largest consumer of paper in this country&quot;.

A large part of his business was publishing government proclamations, forms, and records. He also imported and published books of a general nature, theological texts, hymnals, school books, and books on political philosophy and history, and texts on law and medicine. He offered texts in both English and French, from the United Kingdom, the United States, and, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, from France. He was a well-read man, and fluent in both English and French. He developed a large clientele in the professional classes, from both French Canadians and British Canadians. 

As a natural outgrowth of his business, Neilson was also interested in literary matters in the province, being a member of various literary societies, and the owner of the &quot;Théâtre Canadien&quot;. He was a trustee for the Royal Institute for the Advancement of Learning, and took an interest in developing schools in the province, particularly in the rural areas. On one trip to London, he spoke to the Foreign Schools Society about the difficulties that the Legislative Assembly was having in developing a school system, which he envisaged would be done through the churches.
As his publishing business prospered, Neilson expanded into land-holdings, with interests in agriculture and encouraging immigration. Around 1816, Neilson and two lawyers from Quebec, Andrew Stuart and Louis Moquin, acquired land north of Quebec in the valley of the Jacques-Cartier River. They opened the area, known as Valcartier, for settlement by Scots and Irish immigrants, as well as British veterans of the War of 1812. By 1832 Neilson had close to fifty properties in the areas of Valcartier and Cap-Rouge, where he established a permanent residence for himself. He gradually acquired land in Upper Canada, eventually worth £700.

Neilson was also interested in banking, as a shareholder and client of the Bank of Quebec. He engaged in money-lending, offering loans on generally easy terms, but with fixed repayment schedules.

Neilson was a Justice of the Peace, and an officer in the local militia.

== Political career==
===Lower Canada===
Neilson has been termed a moderate reformer or moderate liberal. Unlike some of the other Lower Canada newspapers, the &quot;Quebec Gazette&quot; did not take radical positions. He had a strong admiration for the British constitution, and also sympathies for the political concerns of French Canadians, such as increased popular control over the provincial government and the abolition of the seigneurial system. He was also strongly committed to the existing constitutional structure of Lower Canada, set out in the &quot;Constitutional Act, 1791&quot;. He was gradually attracted to politics, at first supporting Pierre-Stanislas Bédard, an early leader of the &quot;Parti canadien&quot;, then James Stuart, and then moving towards Louis-Joseph Papineau. Bédard considered Neilson to be one of his most important supporters. Neilson was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in a by-election in 1818, representing Quebec County, the rural areas surrounding Quebec City. He was re-elected in four subsequent elections.

As a member of the British merchant class, Neilson brought some support from British Canadians to the &quot;Parti canadien&quot;, particularly by his reliance on British constitutional principles and commitment to the monarchy. At the same time, through his personal qualities of patience and perseverance, he helped support Papineau, who admitted that he was not strong in those qualities.

In 1823, the British government began to consider reunifying Lower Canada with Upper Canada. Neilson accompanied Papineau to London to lobby against the union project in the name of the majority of the MPs in the Legislative Assembly. The British government did not proceed with the proposal at that time.

In 1828, he was again part of a delegation sent to London, this time with Austin Cuvillier and Denis-Benjamin Viger, to present the party&#x27;s demands for reform of the provincial government, particularly that the Assembly needed to have greater control over the provincial finances. They presented a petition with 80,000 signatures supporting the demand for greater local control. The British government offered significant concessions on the points raised by the Lower Canada delegation, leading to Papineau writing a letter of thanks to Neilson on his return.

During Neilson&#x27;s time in the Assembly, he was a strong advocate for the &quot;censitaires&quot;, the tenant farmers who held their land under the seigneurial system. The possible abolition of the seigneurial system was one of the major issues of the day, with competing interests of the feudal &quot;seigneurs&quot; and the tenant &quot;censitaires&quot;. He took the position that if the seigneurial system were abolished, the &quot;censitaires&quot; should receive title to their plots at no cost. He was also concerned that the seigneurial system was itself making it difficult for farmers to obtain arable land, with conflicts between the &quot;censitaires&quot; and the &quot;seigneurs&quot; over land use.

By 1830, Neilson began to distance himself from the &quot;Parti canadien&quot;, now referred to as the &quot;Parti patriote&quot;, which Neilson considered to be too radical and republican. He had always appealed for moderation, toleration, respect for ethnic and religious differences, and working within the constitutional framework. He began to see Papineau as a radical who detested the constitution and favoured anticlericalism and nationalism. He feared the economic consequences of the increasing radicalism of the &quot;Patriotes&quot;. In 1833, he wrote an editorial in the &quot;Quebec Gazette&quot; stating that it was now the radicals in the Assembly who were betraying the constitution. Papineau responded with public insults.

In 1834, Neilson opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions introduced by Papineau in the Assembly, a rewrite of the 1828 demands for reform with a radical, republican tone. In his private journal, he summarised his view of the resolutions: eleven were true, six were mixed with falsehood, sixteen were false, seventeen doubtful, twelve ridiculous, seven repetitious, fourteen very abusive, four false and seditious, and five good or indifferent. Neilson&#x27;s main point of disagreement was Papineau&#x27;s insistence on an elected Legislative Council, which Neilson considered to be contrary to the spirit of the 1791 constitution. In the debates on the Resolutions, Neilson was one of the leading opponents, and moved three amendments, which were defeated. For his rejection of the Resolutions and break with Papineau, he was called a &quot;chouayen&quot;, or &quot;turncoat&quot;.

In the general election of 1834, Neilson was badly defeated in his seat in Quebec County. Papineau had established a strong party apparatus for the &quot;Patriotes&quot; and specifically targeted Neilson, his former colleague. Worried by the trend in politics, Neilson then helped set up &quot;constitutional associations&quot; in the province, to argue in favour of solutions through constitutional means, and potentially to be the base for a new political party. In 1835, he again travelled to London, this time with William Walker, as delegates from the constitutional associations of Quebec and Montreal. They lobbied members of the British government for changes to the provincial government and constitution, asking them to carry through with the British parliamentary committee&#x27;s recommendations in 1828. Neilson sought, unsuccessfully, to avert the possibility of rebellion in Lower Canada.

In August 1837, the governor appointed him to the Executive Council of Lower Canada and to the Legislative Council. He refused the appointment to the Executive Council, but accepted the appointment to the Legislative Council. Later that year, the Lower Canada Rebellion broke out. The British government suspended the constitution of Lower Canada and created a Special Council to govern the province, chaired by the governor. Neilson was a member of the Special Council from April to June 1838, and again from November 1838 until the creation of the Province of Canada in February 1841.

===Province of Canada===
Following the rebellion in Lower Canada, and the similar Upper Canada rebellion the same year, the British government decided to merge the two provinces into a single province, as recommended by Lord Durham in the Durham Report. The &quot;Union Act, 1840&quot;, passed by the British Parliament, abolished the two provinces and their separate parliaments. The act created the Province of Canada with a single Parliament for the entire province, composed of an elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council. The Governor General retained a strong position in the government.

Neilson opposed the Union after its enactment. In 1841, he stood for election to the Legislative Assembly of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, campaigning against the union. He was elected by acclamation in his old riding of Quebec County. He was also one of the leading organisers of candidates opposed to the union in the Quebec region, under the general name of the &quot;Comité canadien de Québec&quot;. He garnered support from the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which saw the union as an attack on the Catholic &quot;nation canadienne&quot;. He also won support from Papineau, Denis-Benjamin Viger, and the more radical element they represented, although Papineau was in exile in France. Neilson initially aligned with the younger Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, who also opposed the union, but unlike Lafontaine, he considered responsible government a trick. Neilson&#x27;s efforts paid off: out of the forty-two seats in Canada East, twenty or so were won by French Canadians opposed to the union.

When the new parliament convened in Kingston, Canada West, Neilson was one of the leaders of the French-Canadian group in opposition to the union. Neilson brought a motion condemning the union. After a lengthy debate, it was defeated, 50 to 25, the first major vote in the session. Neilson was one of nineteen members from Canada East who voted against the union, along with six Ultra-Reformers from Canada West. During the rest of the first session, he was a consistent opponent of Governor General Lord Sydenham, voting with the French-Canadian group in a loose alliance with the Canada West Reformers.

However, in 1843, there was a notable break in his voting pattern. In that session, there was a ministerial crisis between the primarily Reform ministry and Governor General Metcalfe, leading to the resignation of most of the ministry. In a vote in the Assembly, Neilson voted in support of the Governor General, and against the former ministry. He understood the system of working with a governor, and was suspicious of the new concept of responsible government.

Neilson stood for re-election in the general election of 1844, but was defeated by a more reform-minded candidate, Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau, representing Lafontaine&#x27;s new Reform group. Shortly afterwards, the Governor General appointed Neilson to the Legislative Council, the upper house of the Parliament. He held that position for the remaining four years of his life.

== Death and legacy ==

Neilson died in Cap-Rouge in 1848 and was buried in the Presbyterian church cemetery in Valcartier. Twenty years after his death, his estate was assessed as more than £30,000 in assets, including real estate holdings, and only £25 in liabilities.

In 1976, Neilson was designated a National Historic Person by the federal government&#x27;s heritage registry.

Neilson is one of the major characters in a trilogy of historical novels, &quot;A Chronicle of Lower Canada&quot;, which relates the events leading up to the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837.

There is a street named after him in Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, Quebec.

<doc id="527848" wikidata="Q321956" url="?curid=527848" title="Orlando Bosch">
<text>Orlando Bosch Ávila (18 August 1926 – 27 April 2011) was a Cuban exile militant, who headed the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU), described by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation as a terrorist organization. Born in Cuba, Bosch attended medical school at the University of Havana, where he befriended Fidel Castro. He worked as a doctor in Santa Clara Province in the 1950s, but moved to Miami in 1960 after he stopped supporting the Cuban Revolution.

Between 1961 and 1968 Bosch was arrested several times in the United States for attacks directed at the Cuban government, and briefly collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency. He was jailed in Florida in 1968 for a bazooka attack on a Polish freighter, but violated parole and fled to Venezuela in 1974 at the invitation of fellow exile militant Luis Posada Carriles. Arrested for a bombing, he was released in exchange for surrendering his munitions, and moved to Chile. The US government considered him to have been involved in multiple bombings while there. In 1976 he was arrested for an assassination attempt in Costa Rica; the US declined an extradition offer, and he was sent to the Dominican Republic.

Bosch founded CORU in 1976 along with Posada and other Cuban exiles. The group was responsible for a number of attacks in 1976, including the assassination of Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C. as a part of Operation Condor. CORU is also considered to be responsible for the bombing of Cubana Flight 455, a Cuban civilian airliner, on 6 October 1976 in which all 73 people on board were killed. Bosch, Posada, and two others were arrested and tried for the bombing in Venezuela. Posada escaped from prison, while Bosch was acquitted by a Venezuelan military court in 1986. The other two men, both employees of Posada, were sentenced to twenty years in prison.

Upon his return to the U.S. in 1988, Bosch was arrested for parole violations. The Justice Department, which considered him a terrorist, sought to deport him. He was allowed to stay, and later granted residency, by US President George H. W. Bush after a widespread lobbying campaign that included Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and the president&#x27;s son Jeb Bush. In his later years Bosch raised money to support resistance to the Cuban government, and died in Miami aged 84. He remains a controversial figure, with former US Attorney General Dick Thornburgh describing him as an &quot;unreformed terrorist&quot;.

==Personal life==
Orlando Bosch Ávila was born on 18 August 1926 in the village of Potrerillo, east of Havana. His mother was a school teacher, and his father owned a restaurant. In 1946 Bosch enrolled in the University of Havana medical school, where he befriended the future Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Bosch was president of the medical school student body while Castro was head of the law school student body. Castro was only five days younger than Bosch. Bosch would later state that the two were close friends who frequently smoked cigars together. While they were students, both men worked against the government of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. According to a classmate of his, Bosch&#x27;s fiery temperament earned him the nickname &quot;Piro&quot;, meaning pyromaniac.

After graduating, Bosch moved to Toledo, Ohio for a paediatric internship, beginning in 1952. He then returned to Cuba to work as a doctor in Santa Clara Province. His activities included vaccinating children against polio. He also covertly organized for Castro&#x27;s guerilla war against the Batista government. In 1960, however, less than one-and-a-half years after Castro overthrew Batista, Bosch stopped supporting the Cuban Revolution, and moved to Miami with his wife Myriam, a fellow medical school graduate. They took their four children with them, and soon had another child. The couple divorced ten years later, when Bosch was in prison. Bosch began working for a hospital in Coral Gables, Florida, where he held the position of assistant director.

While in Chile in the early 1970s, Bosch met Adriana Delgado, whom he married in February 1975. Adriana, his second wife, was 20 years younger than him. In 1976, the couple had a daughter. Bosch would return to the United States in 1988, despite being wanted for parole violations, saying &quot;I have a loving wife who resides in the United States and five American children with whom I want to share the last years of my life.&quot; He died in 2011 aged 84 in a hospital in the suburbs of Miami.

==Career==
Bosch had left Cuba in July 1960 after helping to organize a failed anti-Castro rebellion in the Escambray Mountains, and continued participating in anti-Castro activities after moving to Miami. Bosch helped organize the &quot;Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria&quot; (Insurrectional Movement of Revolutionary Recovery, MIRR), which conducted attacks on factories and sugar mills in Cuba, and claimed to be responsible for 11 bombing attacks against government property. From January to November 1962, and again in November 1963, Bosch was in contact with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). On the first occasion, Bosch was intended to help plan infiltration efforts into Cuba, and obtained supplies and safe houses for the team; on the second, Bosch sought funding for airstrikes against Cuba, which the CIA refused. A CIA memorandum from 1976 described Bosch as &quot;General Coordinator&quot; of the MIRR at the time of his contact with the CIA.

===Arrests in Florida and Venezuela===
Bosch was soon fired from his job for keeping explosives on the hospital property, and was arrested several times for his involvement in a series of plots. The first of these was in 1964, when he was caught towing a radio-operated torpedo through rush-hour traffic. The next year, Bosch and five others were charged with smuggling bombs out of the US, after a raid by police on a house close to Orlando. In April 1966 a police roadblock found Bosch transporting bombs made with dynamite; he told them he was taking them to a &quot;secret base where there was a boat we could use to bomb Castro.&quot; In December of the same year, he was charged with extortion. According to a report by the US Department of Justice, Bosch was involved with 30 incidents of terrorism between 1960 and 1968.

Bosch was not convicted for his activities until 1968, when he launched an attack on a Polish freighter. Standing on a bridge over Biscayne Bay, he fired a shell at the ship from a 57 mm homemade bazooka. Bosch was also charged with sending telegrams to the governments of Britain and Mexico, threatening to destroy ships from those countries. During his defense, Bosch stated that he believed the ship was headed to Cuba. Bosch was sentenced to ten years in prison; delivering the judgement, the judge stated that Bosch had &quot;long professed the use of violence to achieve his aims in flagrant disregard of the laws of the United States&quot;. In the trial, the government described Bosch as a member of the terrorist organization Cuban Power, that claimed responsibility for &quot;dozens of bombings and assassination attempts&quot;. Eight others, all described as members of the same group, were also convicted. Among those testifying against Bosch was FBI informant Ricardo Morales.

Bosch served four years of his sentence before being released on parole in 1972. Claude Kirk, then the Governor of Florida, was among those who advocated for Bosch to receive early parole. In June 1974 he told &quot;The Miami News&quot; that he was the head of a group called &quot;Accion Cubana&quot;, and that the organization was responsible for a series of bomb attacks on Cuban consulates in Latin America since August 1973. On 12 April 1974, he violated parole and fled to Venezuela, shortly after he was served a subpoena in a case involving a murder. He had been invited to Venezuela by Luis Posada Carriles, another Cuban exile militant who was then serving as the head of DISIP, the Venezuelan intelligence service. The same year, Bosch detonated bombs at a cultural center and at the Panamanian embassy in Caracas, in both cases just before representatives of the Cuban government were supposed to be there. The date of the attack, 12 October, was Cuba&#x27;s independence day. He was released in exchange for surrendering his arsenal, and was seen soon after in Curaçao, where he said to a newsman, also a Cuban exile: &quot;We will invade the Cuban embassies and will murder the Cuban diplomats and will hijack the Cuban planes until Castro releases some of the political prisoners and begins to deal with us.&quot;

Bosch moved to the Chilean city of Santiago, where the government of Augusto Pinochet provided a safe haven to Bosch and other anti-communists. According to a memo sent to the US by the Chilean government, he arrived on 3 December 1974, going by the alias Pedro Pena. He stayed in a military safe house, and &quot;lived quietly as an artist&quot;. While the Cuban government stated that Bosch did not conduct anti-Castro activities while in Chile, the US government found him responsible for postal bombings of Cuban embassies in Lima, Madrid, Ottawa, and Buenos Aires. The US also accused Bosch of involvement in the August 1975 attempted assassination of Emilio Aragones, the Cuban ambassador to Argentina, and the September 1976 bombing of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala City. In February 1976, he was arrested by the police in Costa Rica, where he was traveling under a fake Chilean passport using the alias Hector Avanzo. After his arrest, the US media reported that he had been involved in a plot to kill Henry Kissinger, then Secretary of State. The arrest resulted from Bosch&#x27;s former and future colleague Posada passing information about Bosch&#x27;s intentions to the CIA. When questioned, Bosch stated that his target was Andrés Pascal Allende, nephew of previous Chilean President Salvador Allende. The Costa Rican authorities offered to extradite him to the US, but the US declined.

===CORU and Flight 455===

Bosch was deported to the Dominican Republic, where he founded the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU), along with Posada, Gaspar Jiménez, and other Cuban exiles. The group, led by Bosch, first met in the Dominican Republic town of Bonao in June 1976, and laid plans for more than 50 bombings over the next year. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) described CORU as &quot;an anti-Castro terrorist umbrella organization.&quot; CORU was responsible for a number of attacks in 1976. These included a machine gun attack on the Cuban embassy in Bogotá, the assassination of a Cuban official in Mérida, the kidnapping of two Cuban embassy employees in Buenos Aires, the bombing of a Cubana airlines office in Panama City, the bombing of the Guyanese embassy in Port of Spain, and the assassination of former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier, a staunch critic of the Pinochet government, in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, declassified documents showed that Letelier&#x27;s assassination, part of a series that occurred during Operation Condor, was directly ordered by Pinochet. Michael Townley, an agent of Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional, the Chilean secret Police, was also involved in the killing.

Bosch was invited to return to Venezuela by Orlando García, the head of security for Venezuelan President Carlos Andrés Pérez. He returned on 23 September 1976, again traveling on a fraudulent passport. Bosch was given a hotel suite for his use, a DISIP identity card using the alias &quot;Carlos Sucre&quot;, and a Venezuelan passport. He was told that he could continue his activities, but that his targets needed to be outside Venezuela. Among those who had apartments in the same hotel were Garcia, and Morales, who had testified against Bosch in Florida, and who was now Garcia&#x27;s deputy. Soon after he arrived in Venezuela, a fundraiser was held in Caracas to support his activities. According to a CIA memorandum, Bosch offered to refrain from planning attacks in the US during Andrés Pérez&#x27;s forthcoming visit to the United Nations in November, if the Venezuelan government made &quot;a substantial cash contribution to [Bosch&#x27;s] organization&quot; in return. Bosch was also reported to have stated, &quot;Now that our organization has come out of the Letelier job looking good, we are going to try something else.&quot; After Letelier&#x27;s assassination, a map of the route Letelier took to work was discovered in Bosch&#x27;s office.

Several days later, Posada was reported to have stated that &quot;we are going to hit a Cuban airplane&quot; and &quot;Orlando has the details.&quot; Flight 455 was a Cubana de Aviación flight departing from Trinidad to Cuba, via Barbados. On 6 October 1976, two time bombs variously described as dynamite or C-4 planted on the Douglas DC-8 aircraft exploded, killing all 73 people on board, including all 25 members of the 1975 Cuban national fencing team. Investigators from Cuba, Venezuela and the United States traced the planting of the bombs to two Venezuelan passengers, Freddy Lugo and Hernán Ricardo Lozano, who had taken the first leg of the flight from Trinidad to Barbados. Both men were employed by Posada at a private detective agency that he ran in Caracas. Ricardo had called both Posada&#x27;s office, and Bosch, soon after the explosions on the plane. CORU released a statement soon after the bombing claiming responsibility for it, and describing the explosion as having killed &quot;57 Cuban communists&quot; (57 of the passengers had been Cuban). Several CIA memoranda from the period implicated Bosch and Posada in the attack. According to an FBI informant, Bosch received a phone call on 6 October, in which he was told &quot;A bus with 73 dogs went off a cliff and all got killed.&quot;

A week later, Posada and Bosch were arrested on charges of masterminding the attack, and were jailed in Venezuela; Bosch&#x27;s arrest occurred on 8 October 1976. Journalist Ann Louise Bardach described the arrests as becoming &quot;a cause célèbre&quot; for politicians in Miami, who lobbied the US government to press for Bosch and Posada&#x27;s release. Miami, Hialeah, and Sweetwater announced an official &quot;Orlando Bosch Day&quot;, and Miami Mayor Maurice Ferré met Bosch while he was imprisoned. Some years later, Otto Reich, a fellow Cuban exile and US Ambassador to Venezuela from 1986 to 1989, also lobbied the US government to push for Bosch&#x27;s release. Reich argued both that Bosch was innocent, and that his safety was threatened. Bosch was also visited by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, investigating an allegation, which Bosch denied, that he had been in a room with Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963. While Bosch was in prison in 1977, Miami area law enforcement officials linked Bosch to several dynamite bombings, including a blast in the offices of Mackey Airlines, after the airline announced plans to resume flights to Cuba.

The Cubana Flight case was initially placed before a civilian judge, who ruled that the court had no jurisdiction. In 1980, Bosch and the others were tried and acquitted by a military court of involvement in the bombing. Bosch and Ricardo were convicted of using false identity papers, and sentenced to four and a half months in prison, which were set against the time they had already been held. The court stated that although the flight had been brought down by a bomb, that there was insufficient evidence to prove the defendants were responsible. Bosch and the others remained imprisoned while the verdict was appealed. In 1983, another military court moved the case back to the civilian judicial system, and the trial was delayed further by Bosch and two others refusing to appear in court. In 1985, during this delay, Posada escaped from prison after bribing a guard using funds raised by the Cuban American National Foundation. Bosch&#x27;s case was eventually resolved in 1986, when he was acquitted: Ricardo and Lugo were each sentenced to 20 years in prison. In total, Bosch was in prison for eleven years. He spent his time in prison writing and painting, and on multiple occasions went on hunger strikes to protest his situation.

===Later career===
Reich asked for permission to grant Bosch a visa to the US on multiple occasions, the last of them in December 1987; his requests were denied. Bosch flew to Miami on 16 February 1988, despite not possessing a visa. On arrival, he was arrested for violating parole in the 1968 Polish freighter case, and also for entering the country illegally. A large campaign began demanding Bosch&#x27;s release, among the leaders of which was Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the Cuban American National Foundation. Mas Canosa testified before a parole board, stating that Bosch and he had been friends for more than two decades, and that he was confident Bosch would not resume violent activities. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen advocated for Bosch&#x27;s release during her successful 1988 congressional campaign, calling Bosch a patriot and a hero. Some of Bosch&#x27;s militant supporters threatened to bomb the Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Services if Bosch was not released, though the threats were not carried out.

Despite this campaign, Bosch&#x27;s application for asylum was rejected by the Justice Department in January 1989. In making his decision, Joe Whitley, at the time the Associate US Attorney General, stated that Bosch had been &quot;resolute and unwavering in his advocacy of terrorist violence&quot;, and that he had &quot;demonstrated a willingness to cause indiscriminate injury and death.&quot; Agents of the local FBI, who investigated Bosch, stated that Bosch was considered &quot;Miami&#x27;s number one terrorist&quot; by the FBI and other law enforcement groups. The Justice Department sought to deport him; 31 countries were asked to allow Bosch entry, but they all refused. Cuba expressed a willingness to take him, but his lawyers declined. After lobbying by Jeb Bush, then a campaign manager for Ros-Lehtinen, however, US President George H. W. Bush overruled the recommendation of the Justice Department, and ordered Bosch&#x27;s release. He was allowed to return to his home in Miami, where he was required to have his phone tapped, his whereabouts monitored, to keep a visitors&#x27; log, and to not associate with militants. Though he agreed to these conditions, he did not keep a log, and stated his intention to associate with whomever he please. Two years later, he was granted US residency by the Bush administration.

After his release Bosch began working for Alberto Hernández, who succeeded Mas Canosa as chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, earning $1,500 a month. In 1997 he was linked to the 1997 Cuba hotel bombings, in which one tourist was killed; he denied involvement, but stated that if he had, he would &quot;still be denying it, since that&#x27;s illegal in this country&quot;. He resumed painting, and used proceeds from the sales of his works to fund resistance to the Cuban government. He also formed an organization, named &quot;Protagonist Party of the People&quot;, to raise money to buy weapons for the anti-Castro movement, violating the terms of his release in doing so. He claimed to have raised $150,000 by 1997.

==Legacy==
In his later years, Bosch remained a controversial figure. He had considerable support among Cuban exiles in the US, and his funeral saw public demonstrations of mourning. In his 2010 memoirs, Bosch denied having planned the bombing, stating that Castro had &quot;accused me, without evidence, of being the intellectual author of the sabotage of Flight 455 and many other acts with which I had nothing to do.&quot; However, he continued to justify the bombing, saying that it was a &quot;legitimate act of war&quot;, and that everyone on board deserved to die, because they &quot;were all Communists.&quot; The Cuban diplomat and historian Jesús Arboleya and the American journalist John Dinges state that Bosch was responsible for the bombing. Dick Thornburgh, US Attorney General under Bush in 1988, referred to Bosch as an &quot;unreformed terrorist&quot;, while the FBI considered CORU, which Bosch led, a terrorist organization. US diplomat Wayne Smith, an expert on Cuban affairs, also called Bosch a terrorist, and stated that he &quot;did a disservice to the cause of democracy and freedom&quot;. Upon Bosch&#x27;s release, an editorial in the &quot;New York Times&quot; accused the Bush administration of hypocrisy, stating that Bush was &quot;squandering American credibility on issues of terrorism&quot;, and that he had protected &quot;one of the hemisphere&#x27;s most notorious terrorists.&quot; Reich&#x27;s advocacy for Bosch created controversy when Reich was nominated to be Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs by the administration of George W. Bush in the early 2000s, and the Bush family&#x27;s role in Bosch&#x27;s release became an embarrassment for it in later years.

<text>Lae (, German: &quot;Preußen-Reede&quot;, later &quot;Lehe&quot;) is the capital of Morobe Province and is the second-largest city in Papua New Guinea. It is located near the delta of the Markham River on the northern coast of Huon Gulf. It is at the start of the Highlands Highway, which is the main land transport corridor between the Highlands Region and the coast. Lae is the largest cargo port of the country and is the industrial hub of Papua New Guinea. The city is known as the &quot;Garden City&quot; and home of the Papua New Guinea University of Technology.

== History ==

Lucas (1972) divides the history of Lae into four periods; the mission phase (1886–1920), the gold phase (1926 until World War II), the timber and agricultural phase (until 1965) and the industrial boom (from 1965) with the opening of the Highlands Highway.

Between 1884 and 1918 the German New Guinea Company established trading posts in Kaiser Wilhelmsland, German New Guinea and on 12 July 1886, a German missionary, Johann Flierl, a pioneer missionary for the Southern Australian Lutheran Synod and the Neuendettelsau Mission Society, sailed to Simbang in Finschhafen, Kaiser-Wilhelmsland and arrived at Lae shortly after. The mission society provided clergy and religious education for Lutheran settlements in Missouri, Iowa and Ohio, Australia, and anywhere else &quot;free thinking&quot; Lutherans had settled.

After World War I, Eastern New Guinea came under British control (Australia) and many of the Germanic names were replaced by English or indigenous ones. &quot;Adolf Haven&quot; was then referred to as Morobe Harbour. Australian officials or kiaps were stationed at various locations within the area and in 1921 the military administration transitioned to a civilian administration, a gold prospector named Cecil John Levien was appointed District Officer (Kiap) of Morobe.

On 1 January 1923 Levien acquired a mining right for the area and shortly after formed a syndicate called &quot;Guinea Gold (No Liability)&quot;. The Guinea Gold syndicate formed Guinea Airways Limited in November 1927. In 1927 Levien arranged for the construction of the airstrip at Lae to assist the gold mine productions around Wau.

Lae was declared a town under the &quot;New Guinea Boundaries Ordinance&quot; on 31 March 1931 at the height of the gold rush era and Lae became the prototype for New Guinean towns built up around airstrips. The Europeans lived to the East of Lae Airfield while the New Guineans lived to the West. Cargo arrived in Lae and then was transported by air to the goldfields in Wau.

In July 1937, Lae made world news when American aviator Amelia Earhart was last seen flying out of the airport on her way back to the United States. She was never seen again.

When the volcanic eruptions occurred in Rabaul in 1937, a decision was made to transfer the capital of the Territory of New Guinea to Lae. World War II impeded the transfer and the town was occupied by the Empire of Japan on 8 March 1942. Lae, Rabaul and Salamaua became the major Japanese bases in New Guinea.

The naval Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943 was fought over the Japanese attempt to reinforce Lae with troops sent by sea from Rabaul, an attempt foiled by sustained Allied attack on the Japanese troop transports. In mid-1943, after defeats in the Kokoda Track campaign, the Battle of Buna–Gona and the Battle of Wau, the Japanese retreated to Lae and Salamaua. However, the Salamaua–Lae campaign involved many weeks of fierce fighting, before the town fell to the Allies on 16 September.
In 1971 the Australian Colonial Administration established the first properly constituted Local Government of Lae town and in 1972 Lae was proclaimed a city. Lae&#x27;s development after the war is directly linked to the development of the highlands. Coffee and tea were being grown and a port was needed. Later priority was given on road access, and the Highlands Highway came into existence. The mineral boom occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Geology ==

Lae is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and geologic instability has produced numerous faults, resulting in earthquakes.

Lae sits between the larger Indo-Australian plate and the Pacific plate on the South Bismarck plate in the Ramu-Markham Fault Zone where the New Guinea Highlands Deforming Zone and South Bismarck tectonic plates are converging at up to 50 mm/yr. The city is caught in a giant geological vise and the seismic hazard is significant.

More than 15 years of measurements have been analysed with results indicating how rapidly Lae city and its survey network is deforming.

The Ramu-Markham Fault Zone, which follows the northern edge of the Markham Valley, is the active plate boundary between the South Bismarck plate and tectonostratigraphic terranes within the New Guinea Highlands Deforming Zone. The Ramu-Markham Fault Zone has generated large thrust earthquakes (e.g. 6 April 1999 MW 6.4, 16 km North of Lae, near Hobu, and 22 November 2007 MW 6.8, 110 km North of Lae). Geological evidence suggests that major earthquakes in pre-historic times have occurred in the Lae area, and that there is the potential for another large earthquake to occur anytime within the next 100 years (in).
=== Mount Lunaman ===

Mount Lunaman is high and has a radio tower at the highest point marked by red fixed obstruction lights to assist navigation. At the base of Mount Lunaman at the southern and south-eastern face are the suburbs of Voco Point and Chinatown. The terraces are located to the West of Mount Lunaman.

Mount Lunaman is known to the locals as &quot;Lo&#x27; Wamung&quot;, which means &quot;first hill&quot;, &quot;Hospital Hill&quot; and Fortress Hill by the German settlers.

Mount Lunaman and the Lae urban area have been the subject of several tectonic studies relating to plate shift.

Mount Lunaman was an important landmark for both Japanese and the Allies:
:&quot;The men of the South Australian battalion hammered and sawed vigorously at the top of the terrace. They were reconstructing, with captured Japanese tools, the skeleton of the cottage formerly used as the Japanese commander&#x27;s sanctum. A hole beneath the door led by a tunnel to a labyrinth of passages and apertures which honeycombed Mount Lunaman&quot;.

After the war it was believed that Mount Lunaman contained the remains of many Japanese soldiers who defended Lae using tunnels:

:A Japanese tomb believed to contain bodies of hundreds of Lae defenders was bought by two South Australian men for 1 pound. The tomb lies under Mount Lunaman which is said to house a hospital and when the Japanese in tunnels refused to surrender to the Australian 7th Division and 9th Division troops in 1943 all entrances were sealed. In a 1971 NHK interview with the Japanese Army commander of Lae, he stated that the tunnels in the hill were only ever used for storage, and the Army had used the Lutheran Malahang Hospital some 10 km north of the town.

== Government ==
The Lae City Council is also known as Lae Urban Local-Level Government. It is an Urban Municipal Authority, responsible for the policy decisions, management and administration of the city, by way of providing the municipal services to the residents of the city.

:&quot;Lae City Aims to become one of the Garden Cities of Asia Pacific Region by 2012, by creating a modern, safe, vibrant City, with a strong economy, whilst enhancing its cultural heritage, and by developing a Healthy, well Educated, Harmonious Community, which will enjoys a good living environment.&quot;

The Lae Urban Local-Level Government is a third-tier government. The political structure consists of the Lord Mayor as the head, who is elected by the people, with five elected, and three nominated Councilors. The six elected Councilors representing the six Wards in the city. The nominated Councilors represented the Chamber of Commerce, the Workers Federation Union, and the Women, Youth and Churches.

=== Roads ===

The Lae City has 137 kilometers of roads, which the National Government is responsible for the maintenance of the Independence Drive, the Markham Road, and the Milford Haven Road, while the Lae City Council maintains the rest of the roads in the city. Due to lack of funding, almost all the roads have deteriorated over the years.

=== Electricity ===
In recent years PNG, including Lae has been experiencing problems with electricity supply. . In May 2023 a memorandum of agreement between AG Investment and the Morobe Province Development Authority was signed for the Finschhafen District Hydropower Project. 

== Climate ==
Lae features a tropical rainforest climate under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification, more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and with no cyclones so equatorial. The area experiences an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly of rainfall annually. In fact in no month does Lae, on average, see less than of precipitation. Temperatures show little variance during a typical year in the city, with January temperatures averaging roughly and July temperatures averaging .

<text>Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy () is a book by the German-born Italian sociologist Robert Michels, published in 1911 and first introducing the concept of iron law of oligarchy. It is considered one of the classics of social sciences, in particular sociology and political science.

It was translated to Italian as &quot;Sociologia del partito politico nella democrazia moderna: studi sulle tendenze oligarchiche degli aggregati politici&quot; by Alfredo Polledro in 1912, and then translated from the Italian to English by Eden Paul and Cedar Paul for Hearst&#x27;s International Library Co. in 1915.

This work analyses the power structures of organizations such as political parties and trade unions. Michels&#x27;s main argument is that all organizations, even those in theory most egalitarian and most committed to democracy – like socialist political parties – are in fact oligarchical, and dominated by a small group of leadership.

The book also provides a first systematic analysis of how a radical political party loses its radical goals under the dynamics of electoral participation. The origins of moderation theory can be found in this analysis.

==Synopsis==
Michels put forward a thesis about incompatibility of democracy and large-scale social organizations. He observed that contrary to democratic and egalitarian principles, both society in general, and specific organizations in particular are dominated by the leadership – the oligarchy. This, according to Michels, was not because of any particular weakness of a particular society or organization in question, but a characteristic of any and all complex social systems. Such social systems have to be organized along bureaucratic lines, managed by departments staffed with non-elected officials, and bureaucracies inevitably develop oligarchies. Michels concluded that in any complex organization, and such dominate the modern world, it is impossible to escape domination of oligarchy - a conclusion which became known as the iron law of oligarchy.

The iron law of oligarchy is based on the following logic. First, any large scale organization will necessitate the development of bureaucracy for efficient administration. Such leaders will amass resources (superior knowledge control over the formal means of communication with the membership, and the skill in the art of politics) giving them power at the expense of rank and file members.

Second, Michels expressed doubts about whether the rank and file possess the skills necessary to compete with the leaders, a concept he phrased as the &quot;incompetence of the masses&quot;. In order to prevent the development of an oligarchy, the regular members must be involved in various activities of the organizations; however, reality of time constraints due to work, family and leisure will reduce the amount of time that most such members are willing to dedicate to active involvement in organizational activities and politics. This is compounded by the rank and file lack of education, and corresponding sophistication of the leadership.

In his case study of his contemporary socialist parties, primarily the German Social Democratic Party. It was radical organization in his time, fighting for novel concepts such as adult suffrage, free speech, and popular participation in the government. Michels described how their political program was overshadowed by the expansion of the organization favoured by the administrative bureaucracy. This, Michels observed, can be explained thus: &quot;it is far from obvious that the interests of the masses which have combined to form the party will coincide with the interests of the bureaucracy in which the party becomes personified.&quot; Michels noted that if an organization dedicated to such principles failed to realize its democratic ideals in its own governance, it is unlikely that other organizations, even less concerned with such lofty goals, would be able to function as democracies.

==Significance==
Michels book quickly became a classic of social sciences. His theory was quickly vindicated on a large scale during First World War, when most socialist parties of that time endorsed the war policies of their respective governments, thus showing that their corresponding party leaders put the short-term goals of organizational survival (allying with the state) over doctrinal points of &quot;proletariat against bourgeoisie&quot;.

Sigmund Neumann said that &quot;the study of sociology of political parties have been completely dominated by Robert Michels&#x27; iron law of [oligarchy].&quot; Michels work significantly influenced the views on political party theory by his friend and one of the founding fathers of sociology, Max Weber. A number of other theorists of political parties acknowledged that this work was a major influence on theirs, including James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce, Maurice Duverger, and Robert McKenzie, among others.

Beyond political parties, Michels work was used to explain the functioning of numerous other voluntary organizations from trade unions to medical associations. His theories are also seen as being applicable and influential to the study of all organizations in general, as well as theories of bureaucracy.

==Criticism==
Michels&#x27; argument has been criticized for being over-deterministic and overly critical of bureaucracy.

==Quotes==
* &quot;A party of the landed gentry which should appeal only to the members of its own class and to those of identical economic interests, would not win a single seat, would not send a single representative to parliament. A conservative candidate who should present himself to his electors by declaring to them that he did not regard them as capable of playing an active part in influencing the destinies of the country, and should tell them that for this reason they ought to be deprived of the suffrage, would be a man of incomparable sincerity, but politically insane.&quot;

<text>Jeffrey Allen Townes (born January 22, 1965), known professionally as DJ Jazzy Jeff (or simply Jazz), is an American DJ and producer. He was one half of the hip hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, along with rapper-turned-actor and fellow Philadelphia native Will Smith. He is credited, along with DJs Spinbad and Cash Money, with popularizing the transformer scratch.

== Early life and initial career ==
Townes was born on January 22, 1965, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Raised in the area, Townes developed a reputation and a following as a local school and block party DJ.

He was ten years old when he first became interested in being a DJ. He told author Paul Stenning, &quot;At summer time block parties I wouldn&#x27;t be the one dancing, I sat where the DJ was set up, watching him. Even when I would go to other block parties in other neighborhoods I was still infatuated with the DJ. He was the guy that played music that everyone in the neighborhood loved. You might not have known his face, you might not have known his name but he was the guy that made everyone move.&quot;

He took the stage name DJ Jazzy Jeff. He was one half of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, along with Will Smith. The group received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, though their most successful single was &quot;Summertime&quot; which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===

When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,&quot; Jazzy Jeff played a character named Jazz, Smith&#x27;s best friend on the show. Jazzy Jeff was initially a recurring character in the first season, but became a regular shortly thereafter. In the early seasons, the two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back, snap with both characters saying &quot;Pssh!&quot;). A running joke throughout the show&#x27;s run involved the character being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), most often using the same footage for comedic effect, but sometimes filming new footage instead. Jazz had an unrequited crush on Hillary Banks (played by Karyn Parsons).

=== Music ===
One of the first records DJ Jazzy Jeff ever appeared on was with the Korner Boyz (Street Artz Records) and their songs &quot;Bust the Move&quot; and &quot;The Saga of Roxanne&quot;, which featured legendary Philadelphia rappers MC Parry P and Grand Tone. The instrumental was called &quot;Jazzy Jeff Scratch&quot; (1985).

As a duo, DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy Award ever presented in 1989 for &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;.

At the time of winning the Grammy Award, DJ Jazzy Jeff came home crying as he had just $500 in the bank.

DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince also won a second Grammy for &quot;Summertime&quot;.

After DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&amp;B, soul, and neo soul record producer and actor, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Eric Roberson, Jill Scott, Musiq Soulchild, Eminem, the Roots, Raheem DeVaughn, Darius Rucker, Talib Kweli, Floetry, Rhymefest, and many more. Despite separating from Will Smith as a music partner, they remain close friends and occasionally work together.

Some songs by Smith were produced by Townes, and he has performed on some songs by Smith such as &quot;So Fresh&quot; and &quot;Potnas&quot;. In addition, he appeared in several of Smith&#x27;s music videos such as &quot;Will2K&quot; and &quot;Freakin&#x27; It&quot;. On some occasions, he made appearances with Smith at live concerts, producing DJ scratches. On July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. Moreover, Smith acknowledges him in his music such as &quot;Comin&#x27; to the Stage&quot; from the album &quot;Lost and Found&quot; and &quot;Potnas&quot; from his album &quot;Willennium&quot;.

His 2007 release &quot;The Return of the Magnificent&quot; featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Peedi (a remake of &quot;Brand New Funk&quot;), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn. In 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in a video directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest.

In 2008, Townes performed with Smith at the premiere of the latter&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Hancock&quot;.

In 2009, he made a mixtape titled &quot;He&#x27;s the King...I&#x27;m the DJ&quot; in honor of the late entertainer Michael Jackson. Townes was featured in the video game &quot;DJ Hero&quot; as a playable character. He also has some original mixes in the game.

In 2010, DJ Jazzy Jeff and Mick (formerly known as Mick Boogie) teamed up to release the &quot;Summertime: The Mixtape&quot; series. The mixes are released every summer.

In 2013, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;. Also that same year, DJ Jazzy Jeff released &quot;Vinyl Destination&quot;, a web series documenting his hundred plus DJ shows from all around the world. He also appeared as the lead interview in Paul Stenning&#x27;s book &quot;Success – By Those Who&#x27;ve Made It&quot;.

In 2015, he performed the scratch overdubs for the film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;.

In August 2017, DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith performed two shows in Europe: MTV Summerblast Music Festival in Croatia and the Livewire Festival in Blackpool.

In 2024, he went on tour with New Kids on the Block as a supporting act, alongside Paula Abdul, on The Magic Summer Tour (2024).

In 2025, DJ Jazzy Jeff was announced as one of the remixers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup theme, representing Philadelphia.

== Personal life ==
DJ Jazzy Jeff married Lynette C. Jackson in Jamaica on July 31, 2010.
He has four children: two sons from a previous relationship, Cory Townes, who is also a DJ and actor/musician Amir Mitchell-Townes, and a son (Pleasant) and daughter (August) with Jackson.

<doc id="527886" wikidata="Q1937833" url="?curid=527886" title="Motorcade of Generosity">
<text>Motorcade of Generosity is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Cake. It was recorded at the Pus Cavern studio in Sacramento, California, and released through Capricorn Records on February 7, 1994.

According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Madison Bloom, &quot;Motorcade of Geneoristy&quot; is a lo-fi album with &quot;warm and close&quot; songs that pull from different musical styles, such as honky-tonk and ranchera, and compared its style to &quot;trailing notes down a stairwell into some subterranean tavern, where a cantina band plays over clinking pints.&quot; Music critic Daryl Cater deemed it an example of funky, guitar-oriented &quot;quirk-rock&quot; reminiscent of Phish&#x27;s &quot;genre-hopping jams&quot;.

==Release==
On January 14, 2009, a limited edition orange vinyl re-issue of the album was made available for purchase on the band&#x27;s official website. It sold out in two days.

==Reception==
The album has received a mixed-to-favorable response from critics. AllMusic critic Darryl Cater stated that &quot;Cake&#x27;s minimalist jams occasionally get repetitive&quot;, though he concluded that &quot;there are enough standouts here to easily qualify &quot;Motorcade&quot; as a keeper.&quot; Music reviewer Robert Christgau described the album as &quot;unambiguity from the near side of cool.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2005, the song &quot;I Bombed Korea&quot; was translated into Hebrew and performed by Zeev Tene under the title &quot;Beirut&quot; (), with &quot;Korea&quot; replaced by &quot;Sidon&quot; and &quot;Beirut&quot; in the lyrics. This version was included on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Waltz with Bashir&quot; (2008).

<doc id="527892" wikidata="Q488634" url="?curid=527892" title="Magma chamber">
<text>A magma chamber is a large pool of liquid rock beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock, or magma, in such a chamber is less dense than the surrounding country rock, which produces buoyant forces on the magma that tend to drive it upwards. If the magma finds a path to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently, many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. 
These chambers are hard to detect deep within the Earth, and therefore most of those known are close to the surface, commonly between 1 km and 10 km down.

==Dynamics of magma chambers==

Magma rises through cracks from beneath and across the crust because it is less dense than the surrounding rock. When the magma cannot find a path upwards it pools into a magma chamber. These chambers are commonly built up over time, by successive horizontal or vertical magma injections. The influx of new magma causes reaction of pre-existing crystals and the pressure in the chamber to increase.

The residing magma starts to cool, with the higher melting point components such as olivine crystallizing out of the solution, particularly near to the cooler walls of the chamber, and forming a denser conglomerate of minerals which sinks (cumulative rock). Upon cooling, new mineral phases saturate and the rock type changes (e.g. fractional crystallization), typically forming (1) gabbro, diorite, tonalite and granite or (2) gabbro, diorite, syenite and granite. If magma resides in a chamber for a long period, then it can become stratified with lower density components rising to the top and denser materials sinking. Rocks accumulate in layers, forming a layered intrusion. Any subsequent eruption may produce distinctly layered deposits; for example, the deposits from the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius include a thick layer of white pumice from the upper portion of the magma chamber overlaid with a similar layer of grey pumice produced from material erupted later from lower in the chamber.

Another effect of the cooling of the chamber is that the solidifying crystals will release the gas (primarily steam) previously dissolved when they were liquid, causing the pressure in the chamber to rise, possibly sufficiently to produce an eruption. Additionally, the removal of the lower melting point components will tend to make the magma more viscous (by increasing the concentration of silicates). Thus, stratification of a magma chamber may result in an increase in the amount of gas within the magma near the top of the chamber, and also make this magma more viscous, potentially leading to a more explosive eruption than would be the case had the chamber not become stratified.

Supervolcano eruptions are possible only when an extraordinarily large magma chamber forms at a relatively shallow level in the crust. However, the rate of magma production in tectonic settings that produce supervolcanoes is quite low, around 0.002 km3 year−1, so that accumulation of sufficient magma for a supereruption takes 105 to 106 years. This raises the question of why the buoyant silicic magma does not break through to the surface more frequently in relatively small eruptions. The combination of regional extension, which lowers the maximum attainable overpressure on the chamber roof, and a large magma chamber with warm walls, which has a high effective viscoelasticity, may suppress rhyolite dike formation and allow such large chambers to fill with magma.

If the magma is not vented to the surface in a volcanic eruption, it will slowly cool and crystallize at depth to form an intrusive igneous body, one, for example, composed of granite or gabbro (see also pluton).

Often, a volcano may have a deep magma chamber many kilometers down, which supplies a shallower chamber near the summit. The location of magma chambers can be mapped using seismology: seismic waves from earthquakes move more slowly through liquid rock than solid, allowing measurements to pinpoint the regions of slow movement which identify magma chambers.

As a volcano erupts, surrounding rock will collapse into the emptying chamber. If the chamber&#x27;s size is reduced considerably, the resulting depression at the surface can form a caldera.

== Examples ==
In Iceland, Thrihnukagigur, discovered in 1974 by cave explorer Árni B. Stefánsson and opened for tourism in 2012, is the only volcano in the world where visitors can take an elevator and safely descend into the magma chamber.

<doc id="527894" wikidata="Q1346818" url="?curid=527894" title="Mark E. Smith">
<text>Mark Edward Smith (5 March 1957 – 24 January 2018) was an English singer-songwriter. He was the lead vocalist, lyricist and only constant member of the post-punk group The Fall. Smith formed the band after attending the June 1976 Sex Pistols gig at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester and was its leader until his death. During their 42-year existence, the Fall&#x27;s line-up included some sixty musicians, with whom Smith released 32 studio albums and numerous singles and EPs.

Smith had a difficult and complex personality and was a long-term alcoholic. He was known for his biting and targeted wit, evident in interviews, for which he was much in demand by music journalists throughout his career. He was suspicious of the trappings of fame and largely avoided socialising with people associated with the music scene, including other Fall members. The dark and sardonic aspect of his personality often appears in his lyrics; he especially derided music industry people. Smith&#x27;s approach to music was unconventional and he did not have high regard for musicianship, stating that &quot;rock &amp; roll isn&#x27;t even music really. It&#x27;s a mistreating of instruments to get feelings over.&quot;

The Fall are regarded as one of the most important and influential post-punk bands of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Although Smith was difficult to work with, he was revered by fans and critics, and was described as a &quot;strange kind of antimatter national treasure.&quot;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Smith was born to working-class parents Irene (&quot;née&quot; Brownhill) and Jack Smith, in Broughton, Salford, the eldest of four siblings. He had three sisters: Suzanne (who later painted the front sleeve for the 1980 Fall album &quot;Grotesque (After the Gramme)&quot;), Caroline, and Barbara. His grandfather, James Brownhill, had fought in France during the Second World War and was involved at the Dunkirk evacuation. Jack was too young to have fought in the war, but joined the army as soon as he was old enough. Smith&#x27;s parents had moved to nearby Sedgley Park, Prestwich after their marriage in 1955. Smith&#x27;s father died suddenly in 1989 of a heart attack.

According to Simon Ford, Smith did not become interested in music until he was about 14, when his father &quot;allowed a record player into the house.&quot; The first single he bought was &quot;Paranoid&quot; by Black Sabbath, and his first gig was the Groundhogs at Manchester&#x27;s Free Trade Hall. He attended Sedgley Park Primary School, and later Stand Grammar School for Boys before leaving aged 16. That year, he left home and moved in with his girlfriend and future Fall keyboardist, Una Baines, later of the Blue Orchids. He subsequently took an evening class in A-level Literature. His first job was in a meat factory before he became a shipping clerk on Salford docks.

===The Fall===
The Fall were named after the 1956 novel by Albert Camus, and initially consisted of Smith and his friends Martin Bramah, Una Baines and Tony Friel. By this time, Smith was unemployed, having dropped out of college at the age of 19. He gave up his job as a shipping clerk at Salford docks shortly afterward to focus on the band. Their early line-up was formed from early members of the punk rock movement. Their music underwent numerous stylistic changes, often concurrently with changes in the group&#x27;s line-up. The Fall&#x27;s 40-year career can be broken into five broad periods, based on the band&#x27;s membership. These include their early late 1970s line-up, the classic Fall period of Riley/Scanlon/Hanley, the Brix years of 1984-89, their early 1990s revival, and everything after the on-stage fight in New York, after which Hanley quit and Smith was arrested (see below).
He married American guitarist and Fall member Brix Smith on 19 July 1983, after they met in April 1983 in Chicago during a Fall American tour. She joined the group on guitar and vocals for the album &quot;Perverted by Language&quot; and co-wrote some of the best-regarded Fall tracks from the period, and is widely credited for introducing a more mainstream, pop-oriented element to the group&#x27;s sound. She remained with the Fall until the couple divorced in 1989.

Smith remarried twice after this. His second marriage to Saffron Prior, who had worked for The Fall&#x27;s fan club, ended in divorce in 1995. He married Eleni Poulou, also called Elenor or Elena, in 2001. Poulou joined the band in September 2002 and left in April 2016. Smith and Poulou divorced in 2016, and Smith&#x27;s partner at the time of his death was his manager Pamela Vander.

Referring to the Fall&#x27;s 60-odd former members, Smith said that he had &quot;only&quot; fired around half the number of people he is said to have dismissed, and that some left of their own free will. He would fire musicians for seemingly trivial reasons; he once dismissed a sound engineer for eating a salad, later explaining that &quot;the salad was the last straw.&quot; Marc Riley was fired for dancing to Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; during their Australian tour, although the two had had many arguments beforehand. Smith said that he often changed musicians so that they would not become lazy or complacent.

After the influential British DJ and Fall supporter John Peel died in 2004, Smith made a notorious appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; show in which he seemed stunned and incoherent, which he afterwards put down to a rare incidence of stage fright.

While the Fall never achieved widespread success beyond minor hit singles in the mid-1980s, they have had a loyal cult following throughout their career. Steve Hanley is regarded by many as one of the most talented bassists of his generation, equal to Peter Hook, Andy Rourke or Gary Mounfield.

===Solo work and collaboration===
Alongside his work with the Fall, Smith released two spoken-word solo albums, &quot;The Post-Nearly Man&quot; (1998) and &quot;Pander! Panda! Panzer!&quot; (2002). Both feature readings of Fall lyrics set to electronic sound collages and samples of Fall songs, as well as contributions from members of The Fall. Smith appeared as a guest vocalist for Edwyn Collins, Elastica, Gorillaz, Long Fin Killie, Mouse on Mars, Coldcut and Ghostigital. His contribution to Inspiral Carpets&#x27; 1994 song &quot;I Want You&quot; won UK top 20 recognition, topped John Peel&#x27;s influential Festive Fifty and resulted in Smith&#x27;s first appearance on the UK TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He worked with Mouse on Mars on the project Von Südenfed, whose album, &quot;Tromatic Reflexxions&quot;, was released in May 2007. Smith provided guest vocals on the song &quot;Glitter Freeze&quot; from the 2010 Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, and made a notable appearance later that year on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, where he joined the band on-stage to perform the song during their headlining set. Smith joined the group Shuttleworth to record the World Cup song &quot;England&#x27;s Heartbeat.&quot;

In 1986, he wrote the play &quot;Hey, Luciani&quot;, based on the short reign of Pope John Paul I. Smith made a cameo appearance in the Michael Winterbottom film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002), while his younger self was portrayed by Sam Riley in a section that did not make the final cut of the film, but appears as a deleted scene on the DVD. Smith made an appearance in the BBC Three sitcom &quot;Ideal&quot; in May 2007, playing a foulmouthed, chain-smoking Jesus. A fuzzy, muted version of Fall song &quot;Hip Priest&quot; (1982) appeared in the 1991 film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.

===Death===
Smith died on 24 January 2018 after a long illness with lung and kidney cancer, aged 60 years. His health had been particularly bad during 2017, which led to performances in a wheelchair. A heavy smoker, Smith had long suffered from throat and respiratory problems. His work ethic and output never declined and throughout his illness he continued to release a new album close to once a year. Tributes to Smith came from Brix Smith, Tim Burgess, Liam Gallagher, Andy Bell, Mat Osman, Billy Bragg, Win Butler, Cat Power, Edgar Wright, the Pixies, Garbage, Stuart Murdoch, Terry Christian, Graham Coxon, Irvine Welsh and Gorillaz.

==Lyrical and vocal style==
Smith sang with a heavy Mancunian accent, and wrote in a cryptic style. His abstruse song titles, often derived from cutting out words and phrases from books and newspapers, reflect the same tendency, with a notable example being &quot;To Nkroachment: Yarbles&quot; (1985). His vocal style was similarly unusual, and his delivery is known for his tendency to end phrases with an &quot;ah&quot;-sound. He often speak-sang or sing-slurred his lyrics, especially from the mid-1990s. His singing voice, particularly when playing live, has been described as &quot;rambling&quot;, and he often interjected improvised rants between verses. He tended to write lyrics as free-form prose into one of his many notebooks, and only later set them to pieces of music composed by Fall musicians. He was a prolific writer who often wrote in dense continuous prose, which he would later edit down into lyrics.

A number of Smith&#x27;s vocal tracks were recorded spontaneously at his home, when he sang into a dictaphone or cassette recorder, most notably sections of &quot;Paintwork&quot; from the Fall&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;This Nation&#x27;s Saving Grace&quot;, which also includes the voice of Alan Cooper discussing main sequence stars, from a documentary Smith happened to be watching at the time. He later adapted the resulting sound effect in the studio; examples include for the intro to &quot;Bad News Girl&quot; (1988).

Smith&#x27;s ability as a prose writer is evident in songs that abandon the verse/chorus format in favour of a long continuous narrative. Examples include &quot;Spectre Vs Rector&quot; (1979), &quot;The North Will Rise Again&quot; (1980), &quot;Winter (Hostel-Maxi)&quot; and &quot;Winter 2&quot; (1982), and &quot;Wings&quot; (1983). Fall songs written in this style are often not concerned with character or story development, establishing a sense of place and atmosphere instead. By the late 1980s, Smith had largely given up this format. Some early songs concern one of his assumed alter-egos, though always from a third-person point of view. Examples include Roman Totale XVII, &quot;the bastard offspring of Charles I and the Great God Pan&quot;, who appears in &quot;The N.W.R.A&quot; (1980), the live album &quot;Totale&#x27;s Turns&quot;, &quot;2nd Dark Age&quot; (one of the b-sides to the &quot;Fiery Jack&quot; single), and the sleeve credits for &quot;Dragnet&quot;, as well as the characters in &quot;Fiery Jack&quot; (1980), &quot;Hip Priest&quot; (1982), &quot;The Man Whose Head Expanded&quot; (1983), and &quot;Riddler&quot; (1986). Rare first person narratives include &quot;Frenz&quot;, &quot;Carry Bag Man&quot;, and &quot;The Steak Place&quot; from 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Frenz Experiment&quot;, as well as &quot;Bill Is Dead&quot; (1990), &quot;Living Too Late&quot; (1986), and &quot;Edinburgh Man&quot; (1991). He did not respond to requests to explain the meaning or sources behind his lyrics. When asked by a journalist as to how much of his self could be found in the song&#x27;s characters, he replied &quot;dunno, you&#x27;re the one sitting there in your round glasses and leather jacket. You tell me what you think it&#x27;s an extension of...for every bloke pulling a pint, there&#x27;s about ten thousand journalists writing an article about it.&quot;

Fragments of Smith&#x27;s lyrics often appeared as handwritten scribbles on early Fall album and single covers, coupled with collages he had put together. In a 1983 interview with &quot;Sounds&quot;, Smith said that he liked artwork to reflect the album content and explained how his graphic choices reflected his attitude to music. He mentioned how he was drawn to cheap and misspelled posters, amateur layouts of local papers and printed cash and carry signs with &quot;inverted commas where you don&#x27;t need them.&quot; His technique was often imitated, for example on Pavement&#x27;s early releases, which heavily resemble the artwork for &quot;Hex Enduction Hour&quot; (1982), and whom Smith described as &quot;mere Fall copyists.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s lyrics were described by critic Simon Reynolds as &quot;a kind of Northern English magic realism that mixed industrial grime with the unearthly and uncanny, voiced through a unique, one-note delivery somewhere between amphetamine-spiked rant and alcohol-addled yarn.&quot; He described his approach as wanting to combine &quot;primitive music with intelligent lyrics.&quot; Thematically, his frequently densely layered words often centre around descriptions of urban grotesques, gloomy landscapes, &quot;crackpot history&quot;, and are infused with regional slang. In interviews, Smith cited Colin Wilson, Arthur Machen, Wyndham Lewis, Thomas Hardy, M. R. James, Algernon Blackwood, Clark Ashton Smith, and Philip K. Dick as influences, as well as Edgar Allan Poe, Ezra Pound, Raymond Chandler, and H. P. Lovecraft.

==Personality==

Smith had a difficult and often reactionary personality, and was defiantly Northern English in outlook. Brix said that he carried &quot;a chip on both shoulders. I remember him talking about fucking southern bastards a lot and not wanting to come to London. He hated London intensely. He&#x27;s quite contrarian as a person and as a writer, which is what gives him his edge.&quot; Throughout his career, he clashed with musicians, record producers, sound engineers, record label heads and fellow Manchester scene alumni such as Tony Wilson, Peter Hook, Shaun Ryder and Morrissey, whom he disparagingly referred to as &quot;Steven.&quot; 

Smith had a working class and anti-intellectual outlook, but a strong interest in literature. As the journalist Andrew Harrison observed, although he wished that a majority of his audience were miners and postmen, a great many were students or &quot;Guardian&quot; readers.

According to biographer Simon Ford, Smith often treated musicians as would &quot;[a] bad-tempered despot.&quot; He was highly charismatic and cultivated a wry and misanthropic personality during interviews and live performances. As an interviewee, his dry and caustic wit was very quotable, especially when he was critiquing other contemporary bands and &quot;music personalities&quot;, a favoured pastime. He became a mainstay of the English music press throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and his sharp tongue often turned on the journalists themselves; many reported being nervous before meeting him, and published &quot;war stories&quot; afterwards.

During his later performances, he often walked off stage in frustration, or maliciously interfered with the musicians&#x27; instruments. This behavior culminated during a 1998 gig at Brownies in New York, at a low point in his life when he was drinking heavily and band morale was at its lowest. During the performance he got into an onstage fight with the other musicians, leading to long-term bassist Steve Hanley and drummer Karl Burns quitting the band. The night ended with Smith&#x27;s arrest for assaulting his girlfriend and Fall keyboardist Julia Adamson, and is widely considered the band&#x27;s nadir and Smith&#x27;s low point. Smith was ordered to undergo treatment for alcohol abuse and anger management. The police charges were dropped after a period of good behaviour.

Smith said that his favourite things in life were &quot;Scottish people, cats, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, and Can.&quot; He was a passionate football fan and lifelong Manchester City follower: even appearing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Final Score&quot; to read the classified football results. He admired mavericks such as George Best, whom he met and drank with, and observed how if Best could have drawn a crowd of 40,000 people a week he should have been able to &quot;do what he liked.&quot;

Originally a Labour supporter, Smith left the party during the Falklands War (which he supported), then became further disillusioned with Labour during the Tony Blair era. In the 1997 election, he voted for the Conservative Party in opposition to Blair. Asked during a mid-1980s interview with &quot;Smash Hits&quot; as to what policies he would adopt if he became Prime Minister, he said: &quot;I&#x27;d halve the price of cigarettes, double the tax on health food, then I&#x27;d declare war on France.&quot; In a 2012 interview, Smith jokingly stated he would put the Queen in charge of Britain when asked the same question. Smith also expressed support for the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union. Although a longstanding member of the Musicians Union, he criticised their political outlook, saying, &quot;all they say is vote Corbyn and stay in the European Union&quot;.

==Legacy==
Smith was both resigned and ambivalent about his legacy, especially in terms of the fad-orientated music industry of which he was often harshly critical in his lyrics. He noted, somewhat bitterly, how &quot;every artist wants credibility. A couple of years ago, I read a poll on the hundred best artists of all time. The Fall was in there between Mozart and Puccini. I was very proud of that. Of course, the next day I can pick up a paper and be the guy with no teeth who beats everybody up.&quot; Despite this, he was widely influential and critically acclaimed throughout his career, in part because he did not seek to capitalise on current trends which might have dated the band. He was particularly dismissive of the Madchester scene, as well as the post-punk revival bands of the 2000s who cited him and the Fall as an influence, whom he personally felt owed more to Talking Heads.

Similarly, he refused to look backwards; when recording, he was adamant that the Fall not repeat themselves stylistically, and when playing live, he refused to play old songs. The approach is further seen in his strategy of frequently replacing band members. Long-term fan John Peel said that &quot;the Fall are the group against which all others must measure themselves&quot;, and when asked which Fall albums he would recommend to newcomers, he replied, &quot;all of them.&quot; In January 2005, Smith was the subject of &quot;The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E. Smith&quot;, a BBC Four television documentary.

A number of alternative rock artists have mentioned Smith in their songs. The Jazz Butcher released &quot;Southern Mark Smith&quot; in 1983. Barbara Manning&#x27;s song &quot;Mark E. Smith &amp; Brix&quot; appears on her 1989 album &quot;Lately I Keep Scissors&quot;. German rock band Tocotronic mentioned him in their song &quot;Ich habe geträumt, ich wäre Pizza essen mit Mark E. Smith&quot; (&quot;I dreamt I went to eat pizza with Mark E. Smith&quot;) on their 1996 album &quot;Wir kommen um uns zu beschweren&quot; (&quot;We come to complain&quot;). Elastica released the track &quot;How He Wrote Elastica Man&quot; in 2000, which was co-written by, and features Smith, the title being a reference to the 1980 Fall song &quot;How I Wrote &#x27;Elastic Man&#x27;&quot;, while in 2014 Fat White Family released an EP titled &quot;I Am Mark E Smith.&quot;, a reference to the 1985 Fall song &quot;I am Damo Suzuki&quot;. Sonic Youth covered three Fall songs, as well as the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Victoria&quot;, which they released in 1990 as the &quot;4 Tunna Brix&quot; EP. Cedric Bixler-Zavala, singer for the American groups At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta, described Smith as &quot;one of the pillars of influence for me as lyricist and trouble maker.&quot;

<text>Prediction by partial matching (PPM) is an adaptive statistical data compression technique based on context modeling and prediction. PPM models use a set of previous symbols in the uncompressed symbol stream to predict the next symbol in the stream. PPM algorithms can also be used to cluster data into predicted groupings in cluster analysis.

== Theory ==

Predictions are usually reduced to symbol rankings. 
Each symbol (a letter, bit or any other amount of data) is ranked before it is compressed, and the ranking system determines the corresponding codeword (and therefore the compression rate).
In many compression algorithms, the ranking is equivalent to probability mass function estimation. Given the previous letters (or given a context), each symbol is assigned with a probability. 
For instance, in arithmetic coding the symbols are ranked by their probabilities to appear after previous symbols, and the whole sequence is compressed into a single fraction that is computed according to these probabilities.
The number of previous symbols, &quot;n&quot;, determines the order of the PPM model which is denoted as PPM(&quot;n&quot;). Unbounded variants where the context has no length limitations also exist and are denoted as &quot;PPM*&quot;. If no prediction can be made based on all &quot;n&quot; context symbols, a prediction is attempted with &quot;n&quot; − 1 symbols. This process is repeated until a match is found or no more symbols remain in context. At that point a fixed prediction is made.

Much of the work in optimizing a PPM model is handling inputs that have not already occurred in the input stream. The obvious way to handle them is to create a &quot;never-seen&quot; symbol which triggers the escape sequence. But what probability should be assigned to a symbol that has never been seen? This is called the zero-frequency problem. One variant uses the Laplace estimator, which assigns the &quot;never-seen&quot; symbol a fixed pseudocount of one. A variant called PPMd increments the pseudocount of the &quot;never-seen&quot; symbol every time the &quot;never-seen&quot; symbol is used. (In other words, PPMd estimates the probability of a new symbol as the ratio of the number of unique symbols to the total number of symbols observed).

== Implementation ==

PPM compression implementations vary greatly in other details. The actual symbol selection is usually recorded using arithmetic coding, though it is also possible to use Huffman encoding or even some type of dictionary coding technique. The underlying model used in most PPM algorithms can also be extended to predict multiple symbols. It is also possible to use non-Markov modeling to either replace or supplement Markov modeling. The symbol size is usually static, typically a single byte, which makes generic handling of any file format easy.
Published research on this family of algorithms can be found as far back as the mid-1980s. Software implementations were not popular until the early 1990s because PPM algorithms require a significant amount of RAM. Recent PPM implementations are among the best-performing lossless compression programs for natural language text.

PPMd is a public domain implementation of PPMII (PPM with information inheritance) by Dmitry Shkarin which has undergone several incompatible revisions. It is used in the RAR file format by default. It is also available in the 7z and zip file formats.

Attempts to improve PPM algorithms led to the PAQ series of data compression algorithms.

A PPM algorithm, rather than being used for compression, is used to increase the efficiency of user input in the alternate input method program Dasher.

<text>The Dicta Boelcke is a list of fundamental aerial maneuvers of aerial combat formulated by First World War German flying ace Oswald Boelcke. Equipped with one of the first fighter aircraft, Boelcke became Germany&#x27;s foremost flying ace during 1915 and 1916. Because of his success in aerial combat and analytic mind, he was tasked by Colonel Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen with writing a pamphlet on aerial tactics. 

Completed in June 1916, it was distributed throughout the German Army&#x27;s Air Service &quot;(Die Fliegertruppen des Deutschen Reiches)&quot;, some two years before the French and British militaries followed suit with their own tactical guides. Air combat tactical manuals based on the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot; have become more elaborate over time, and have become a mainstay for NATO&#x27;s air combat training of American, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Turkish, Italian, and Greek fighter pilots.

==The author==

Oswald Boelcke was one of the first German pilots successful in air-to-air combat. During mid-May 1915, he began to fly one of the original fighter aircraft equipped with a synchronized gun. As he began to shoot down opposing French and British airplanes, he became one of the first German fighter aces. Often flying with Max Immelmann, Boelcke gained experience in the new realm of aerial combat as he discovered the utility of having a wingman, of massing fighter planes for increased fighting power, and of flying loose formations allowing individual pilots tactical independence. Based on his successful combat experiences, he used his training as a professional soldier and his powers as an analytic thinker to design tactics for the use of aircraft in battle.

During this period of pioneering aerial warfare, the British Royal Flying Corps air effort could be summed up by &quot;Attack everything&quot;. The French &quot;Aeronautique Militaire&quot; was concentrating its efforts on building up its bomber force. Boelcke tried to interest Immelmann in devising a tactical doctrine for fighters, to no avail. In mid-1916, Boelcke codified his tactics in the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;, which was the world&#x27;s first tactical aerial combat manual for an air force.

During early 1916, Boelcke wrote a brochure entitled &quot;Experiences of Air Fighting&quot;, giving tips for attacking any one of three types of opposing aircraft. This was not unique; a few other fliers in the war were sharing such combat tips with one another on a personal level.

After Immelmann&#x27;s death, Boelcke was withdrawn from combat on 27 June 1916, while he was the war&#x27;s leading ace, and assigned to &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; (Flying Troops) headquarters. His reassignment was in line with the German military doctrine of &quot;Auftragstaktik&quot;, or order tactics: The belief that the junior officer on the battlefield best knows the tactics needed there. As part of his staff duties revamping the &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; into the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (Air Force) in early October 1916, Boelcke wrote the &quot;Dicta&quot;, which was then distributed throughout the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; as the world&#x27;s first tactical air combat manual. It was two years before the British and French followed suit in 1918. Spurred by the example of the &quot;Dicta&quot;, many of the world&#x27;s military air forces eventually developed their own tactical manuals, codified as tactics, techniques, and procedures.

==The &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;==
According to Boelcke&#x27;s first biographer, Professor Johannes von Werner, the eight dicta were written for Colonel Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen.

# Try to secure advantages before attacking. If possible, keep the sun behind you.
# Always carry through an attack when you have started it.
# Fire only at close range, and only when your opponent is properly in your sights.
# Always keep your eye on your opponent, and never let yourself be deceived by ruses.
# In any form of attack it is essential to assail your enemy from behind.
# If your opponent dives on you, do not try to evade his onslaught, but fly to meet it.
# When over the enemy&#x27;s lines never forget your own line of retreat.
# For the &quot;Staffel&quot; (squadron): Attack on principle in groups of four or six. When the fight breaks up into a series of single combats, take care that several do not go for the same opponent.

There are various versions of the Dicta. One version that differs somewhat from the above:

# Always try to secure an advantageous position before attacking. Climb before and during the approach in order to surprise the enemy from above, and dive on him swiftly from the rear when the moment to attack is at hand.
# Try to place yourself between the sun and the enemy. This puts the glare of the sun in the enemy&#x27;s eyes and makes it difficult to see you and impossible for him to shoot with any accuracy.
# Do not fire the machine guns until the enemy is within range and you have him squarely within your sights.
# Attack when the enemy least expects it or when he is preoccupied with other duties such as observation, photography, or bombing.
# Never turn your back and try to run away from an enemy fighter. If you are surprised by an attack on your tail, turn and face the enemy with your guns.
# Keep your eye on the enemy and do not allow him to deceive you with tricks. If your opponent seems damaged, follow him down until he crashes to be sure he is not faking.
# Foolish acts of bravery only bring death. The &quot;Jasta&quot; (squadron) must fight as a unit with close teamwork between all pilots. The signals of its leaders must be obeyed.
# For the &quot;Staffel&quot; (squadron): Attack in principle in groups of four or six. When the fight breaks up into a series of single combats, take care that several do not go for one opponent.

Still another version can be found online.

If followed assiduously, the &quot;Dicta&quot; tactics often led to an unseen approach for a surprise attack. As historical study has shown, thus getting in the first shot in an engagement guarantees a successful attack over 80% of the time.

==Legacy==

After writing the &quot;Dicta&quot;, Boelcke&#x27;s tactics were taught in the fighter school he had suggested founding. He suggested that fighter planes be organized into squadrons. He also organized and led one of these original German fighter squadrons, &quot;Jagdstaffel 2&quot;. By the time he died in action after his 40th victory, he had thoroughly schooled his squadron in his tactics. &quot;Jasta 2&quot; went on to be one of the two most successful German fighter squadrons during the remainder of the war, scoring 336 victories, and achieving a victory ratio that ran as high as 12 to one.

Eight of &quot;Jasta 2&quot; original members became aces. 25 aces served in &quot;Jasta 2&quot;, scoring 90% of its victories. Four of its members served as generals during World War II. There was a steady rotation of &quot;Jasta 2&#x27;s&quot; aces into commands of other squadrons. The most prominent example of this was Manfred von Richthofen, leading ace of the war and assigned to command the most successful German squadron, &quot;Jasta 11&quot;. As a result of Boelcke&#x27;s tactical concepts, the Imperial German Air Service exacted an ever greater toll on Allied aircraft right up until war&#x27;s end. For instance, &quot;Jasta 2&quot; was credited with 46 victories for September 1918.

When the next logical step was taken by the Germans in organizing fighter squadrons into a wing in June 1917, Richthofen was picked to lead it. Before his death on 21 April 1918, he wrote his own &quot;Dicta&quot; for wing tactics. It referred extensively to Boelcke&#x27;s &quot;Dicta&quot;.

Similar to the Dicta Boelcke was Mick Mannock&#x27;s Rules of Combat:

During the early days of World War II, South African ace Sailor Malan espoused his Ten Rules for Air Fighting. These rules closely followed the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;. For instance, Rule 5&#x27;s &quot;Always turn and face the attack&quot; could have been borrowed from the &quot;Dicta&quot;. Malan&#x27;s Rules were distributed throughout the Royal Air Force.

The simple &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot; manual has, over time, evolved into widespread use of tactics, techniques, and procedures manuals for air forces worldwide. The United States Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the United States Navy (USN), and the United States Air Force (USAF) each have their own air tactics manuals. Under the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the USAF trains German, Dutch, Norwegian, Turkish, Italian, and Greek fighter pilots at Sheppard Air Force Base, using air tactics manuals descended from the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;.

<text>The November class, Soviet designation Project 627 Kit (, NATO reporting name November) was the Soviet Union&#x27;s first class of nuclear-powered attack submarines, which were in service from 1958 through 1990. All but one have been disposed of, with the K-3, the first nuclear-powered submarine built for the Soviet Navy, being preserved as a memorial ship in Saint Petersburg.

==History==
This class of submarines was built as a result of a 1952 requirement to build an attack submarine with the ability to fire nuclear-tipped torpedoes at coastal American cities.

More than 135 Soviet organizations (20 design bureaus, 35 research institutes, 80 works) participated in the design and construction of this completely new type of submarine in 1952–1958. The chief designer was V.N. Peregudov and the research supervisor was academician A.P. Alexandrov. The class was originally tasked with entering American naval bases and using the battery-powered T-15 torpedo with thermonuclear warhead, to destroy them once in range. (The T-15 torpedo had the following specifications: calibre 1,550 mm, length 23.5 m, range 40–50 km.) However, after expert opinions of Soviet naval specialists were considered, the role of the class changed to torpedo attacks on enemy warships and transport ships during actions along the ocean and distant sea routes. Reflecting this change of mission, the final design of Project 627 was developed with eight 533 mm torpedo tubes instead of the initial plan for one 1,550 mm and two 533 mm torpedo tubes. Project 627/627A submarines could launch torpedoes from 100 m depth. By 1963 this class was still in service but had been overtaken by later technology.

==Description==

The November class were double-hulled submarines with streamlined stern fins and nine compartments (I – bow torpedo, II – living and battery, III – central station, IV – diesel-generator, V – reactor, VI – turbine, VII – electromechanic, VIII – living, IX – stern). Three compartments equipped with bulkheads to withstand 10 atm pressure could be used as emergency shelters.

The November-class attack submarines were considerably noisier than diesel submarines and the early American nuclear-powered submarines, despite the streamlined torpedo-like hull, limited number of holes in the hull, special low-noise variable-pitch propellers, vibration dampening of main equipment, and antisonar coating of the hull (used for the first time on nuclear-powered submarines). Soviet reactors were superior to American ones in compactness and power-to-weight ratio, but the vibrations of Soviet reactors were much more pronounced. Novembers detected submarine targets during active service (for example, there were 42 detections in 1965 when regular cruises of Soviet nuclear-powered submarines began). The Soviet hydroacoustic equipment on the Novembers was not intended for submarine hunting, and had relatively limited capabilities.

The reliability of the first Soviet nuclear-powered submarines was relatively low because of the short service life of the steam generators in the main propulsion machinery, which caused an increase of the radioactivity level in the second loop of the reactor after several hundred hours of reactor operation. Machinery problems were the main reason why Project 627/627A submarines were not used during the Cuban Missile Crisis in autumn 1962. The reliability of the steam generators became better over the course of construction development, handling technical problems and training of crews, so Novembers began to frequently perform Arctic under-ice cruises and patrol missions to trace nuclear delivery vessels in Atlantic Ocean in the 1960s. Despite the common opinion about the dangers of radiation in the first Novembers, the background radiation levels in the compartments was usually normal because of relatively effective iron-water radiation protection of the reactor compartment and radiation monitoring.

The first submarine of the class (Project 627), K-3 &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot; was first underway under nuclear power on 4 July 1958 and became also the first Soviet submarine to reach the North Pole in July 1962, four years after . Project 627 had much better performance specifications (for example, submerged speed and depth) than the world&#x27;s first operational nuclear-powered submarine USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;. The first commander of K-3 &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot; was Captain 1st Rank L.G. Osipenko (future admiral and Hero of the Soviet Union).

All other Novembers except K-3 &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot; belonged to modified project – project 627A. The main visual differences of project 627A were a bow sonar dome in the keel and a hydrophone antenna over the torpedo tubes. The Project P627A design armed with nuclear cruise missile system P-20 was developed in 1956–1957 but not finished, equipment and mechanisms were used for building the usual attack submarine of project 627A (submarine &quot;K-50&quot;).

A single vessel, submarine &quot;K-27&quot;, was built as project 645 to use a pair of liquid metal-cooled VT-1 reactors. &quot;K-27&quot; was launched on 1 April 1962 and had some additional differences from Novembers: cone-shaped hull head, new antimagnetic strong steel alloys, somewhat different configuration of compartments, and a rapid loading mechanism for each torpedo tube. A liquid metal-cooled reactor had better efficiency than the water-cooled VM-A reactor, but technical maintenance of liquid metal cooled reactors in naval base was much more complicated.

==Service history==
The November class served in the Soviet Navy with the Northern Fleet (in 3rd submarine division, later in 17th submarine division). Four of the class (K-14, K-42, K-115, K-133) were transferred to the Soviet Pacific Fleet in the 1960s: K-14, K-42 and K-115 performed Arctic under-ice voyages whereas K-133 transferred to Far East on south route via Drake Strait (covering 21,000 miles during 52 days of submerged running). The surviving vessels were decommissioned between 1986 and 1990. Several of them have been scrapped already. All of the survivors remain laid-up hulks in Russian naval bases (K-14, K-42, K-115 and K-133 of the Pacific Fleet; K-11 and K-21 of the Northern Fleet). There are plans to convert the first submarine of the class (K-3) into a museum ship in St. Petersburg, but the hulk of the submarine remains in Polyarny due to economic reasons and the environmental concerns of some ecological organizations.

==Units==
The November class included 14 submarines: Project 627 (K-3 &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot;), Project 627A (K-5, K-8, K-11, K-14, K-21, K-42 &quot;Rostovskiy Komsomolets&quot;, K-50, K-52, K-115, K-133, K-159, K-181), Project 645 (K-27). K stands for &quot;Kreyserskaya podvodnaya lodka&quot; (literally &quot;Cruising submarine&quot;).

===Project 627===

====K-3====

Later named &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot;. The only submarine of the class built to the original Project 627 design. Construction began at SEVMASH Shipyard, Severodvinsk, in June 1954. The keel was laid on 24 September 1955. Launched on 9 August 1957. First underway on nuclear power 4 June 1958. 17 January 1959 the unit was given to the Navy for experimental use.

There was a serious accident on board K-3 on 8 September 1967. The submarine was performing a patrol mission in the Mediterranean Sea and a hydraulic system fire occurred in compartment one on the 56th day of the cruise at a depth of 49 m during the return home. This occurred north-east of the Faeroes and 39 sailors died due to carbon monoxide poisoning (boatswain Lunya was the only person in the central station who didn&#x27;t black out. He surfaced the submarine and rescued the commander and second-in-command who organized damage control). The submarine reached base successfully. K-3 performed 14 long range cruises and passed 128,443 miles over 30 years (1958–1988).
===Project 627A===

====K-5====
Laid down 13 August 1956. Launched 1 September 1958. Commissioned 26 December 1959.

====K-8====

Laid down 9 September 1957. Launched 31 May 1959. Commissioned 31 December 1959.

On 12 April 1970, after four days on the surface, K-8 sank returning from patrol and participation in the large scale &quot;Okean-70&quot; naval exercise. The accident occurred due to short circuits that took place in III and VII compartments simultaneously at a depth of 120 m and a subsequent fire in the air-conditioning system. This was the first loss of a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine. 52 sailors including the commander, Captain 2nd Rank Vsevolod Borisovich Bessonov, died due to poisoning and the flooding of the surfaced submarine during 80 hours of damage control in stormy conditions, 73 sailors were rescued. K-8 sank with four nuclear torpedoes on board at a depth of 4,680 m (Bay of Biscay).. There were also three small incidents with K-8 whilst on patrol before (breakdowns of steam generators in 1960–1961).

====K-14====
K-14 was laid down on 2 September 1958, launched on 16 August 1959, and commissioned 30 December 1959. K-14 entered service with the Northern Fleet (given to 206th separate brigade of nuclear submarines, based in Malaya Lopatka of Zapadnaya Litsa Fjord) on 31 August 1960. The submarine performed 9 cruises in 1960 (passed 1,997 miles up-top and 11,430 miles submerged), including patrol mission in Atlantic Ocean. In view of reforming of submarine units K-14 was given to 3rd division of nuclear submarines which was a part of 1st submarine flotilla in January 1961. The submarine performed 4 cruises in 1961 (passed 1,356 miles up-top and 1,967 miles submerged).

The first experimental discharging of reactor cores directly in the naval base was made on K-14 in 1961. The reactor compartment was replaced in 1962 because of a breakdown of reactor protection systems.

The submarine performed under-ice cruise from the Northern Fleet to the Pacific Ocean Fleet between 30 August and 17 September 1966, K-14 resurfaced 19 times at the North Pole for searches the Soviet research drifting station SP-15 to apply medical aid to one of the expeditionists from the station. Captain of K-14 captain 1st rank D.N. Golubev and commander of the 3rd division of nuclear submarines (chief officer on board) captain 1st rank N.K. Ignatov were awarded with the Hero of the Soviet Union for that Arctic cruise.

K-14 was given to 10th submarine division (based in Krasheninnikov Bay) which was a part of 15th submarine squadron of the Red Banner Pacific Fleet. The submarine performed 4 patrol missions (160 days) in 1966–1970 and it was under medium repair between December 1970 and March 1973. 10th submarine division became a part of 2nd submarine flotilla of the Red Banner Pacific Fleet in November 1973. K-14 performed 3 patrol missions (135 days) in 1973–1975, participated in training cruises in 1979–1982. On 12 February 1988 a fire took place in a hold of VII compartment during maintenance work in the naval base, the fire was brought under control using submarine chemical smothering arrangement but one man was lost.

The submarine was used for training cruises since 1988 and decommissioned from the Navy&#x27;s order of battle on 19 April 1990. She was laid up in Postovaya Bay (Sovetskaya Gavan) as of 2000. K-14 performed 14 long-range cruises and passed 185,831 miles (22,273 operational hours) since placed in service.

====K-52====
Laid down on 15 October 1959, launched on 28 August 1960, and commissioned 10 December 1960. Decommissioned in 1987.

====K-21====
K-21 was laid down on 2 April 1960 and launched on 18 June 1961. K-21 entered service with the Northern Fleet (given to 3rd division of nuclear submarines which was a part of 1st submarine flotilla, based in Malaya Lopatka of Zapadnaya Litsa Fjord) on 28 November 1961. The submarine performed an Arctic cruise that year (passed 2,382 miles up-top and 3,524 miles submerged) and launched four torpedoes to determine a size of an ice-hole after explosion and a possibility to surface there.

K-21 performed long-range cruise between 24 March and 14 May 1962 (51 days, passed 10,124 miles including 8,648 miles submerged), patrol mission to the Norwegian Sea and North Atlantic according to plan &quot;Ograda&quot; (&quot;Protective fence&quot;) between 23 April and 21 May 1964, patrol mission in Barents Sea in 1965, 3 patrol missions in 1967–1970 (170 days total). Three interim overhauls were made in 1965–1966, 1973–1975 (including refueling in 1975) and 1983–1985. In 1975, K-21 was given to 17th submarine division which was a part of 11th submarine flotilla based in Gremikha. The submarine performed 4 patrol missions in 1976–1980 (200 days total) and combat training cruises in 1986–1989.

K-21 was decommissioned from the order of battle in 1991. She lied up in Gremikha Bay as of May 2000 waiting utilization. K-21 passed 190,831 miles (22,932 operational hours) since placed in service.

====K-11====

K-11 was laid down on 31 October 1960, launched on 1 September 1961, and commissioned 30 December 1961. K-11 entered service with the Northern Fleet (given to 3rd division of nuclear submarines which was a part of 1st submarine flotilla, based in Malaya Lopatka of Zapadnaya Litsa Fjord) on 16 March 1962.

In November 1964 the sail failure of fuel pins was detected during the scheduled repair in Severodvinsk and it was decided to refuel both reactors. On 7 February 1965, the ejection of radioactive steam took place during the lifting of a reactor cover. Crewmembers were evacuated from the reactor compartment, the reactor cover was lowered down and the naval staff was informed about the accident. The arriving naval specialists came to the wrong conclusion that deterioration of the radiation environment was only a result of emission of high-active reactor water and they allowed to continue refueling. On 12 February 1965, the ejection of radioactive steam took place again during the second lift of the reactor cover because of inaccurately following operational instructions, crewmembers overwatching the procedure were evacuated from the reactor compartment and the reactor cover was lowered down. The uncontrolled reactor with the unclear position of its cover remained unwatched during four hours when a fire occurred. The attempts to extinguish the fire in the reactor compartment with the use of fresh water and fire extinguishers were not successful so shipyard firefighting vehicles filled the reactor compartment with 250 tons of outside water. About 150 tons of that radioactive water spread over other submarine compartments through burnt-out sealings and deteriorated the radiation environment in the work area significantly, seven men were exposed to radiation. The only possible decision was to remove the contaminated reactor compartment and to install a new one, which was not done until August 1968.

K-11 performed five patrol missions in 1968–1970 (305 days). The submarine was modernized between November 1971 – September 1973 and given to 17th submarine division of 11th submarine flotilla based in Gremikha in 1975. K-11 performed four patrol missions in 1975–1977 (173 days) and five patrol missions in 1982–1985 (144 days). The submarine was decommissioned from the order of battle on 19 April 1990. She was laid up in Gremikha as of 2000. K-11 passed 220,179 miles (29,560 operational hours) since placed in service.

====K-133====
K-133 was laid down on 3 July 1961, launched on 5 July 1962, and commissioned 29 October 1962. K-133 entered service with the Northern Fleet (given to 3rd submarine division which was a part of 1st submarine flotilla, based in Bolshaya Lopatka of Zapadnaya Litsa Fjord) on 14 November 1962.

In 1963 the submarine performed a long-range cruise (51 days) to Atlantic equatorial zone for the first time for Soviet Navy. She was under current repairs between October 1964 and September 1965. K-133 together with K-116 (Project 675 submarine) for the first time in the world performed submerged voyage from the Northern Fleet to the Pacific Ocean Fleet via Drake Strait under the general command of Rear Admiral A. Sorokin from 2 Febr. to 26 March 1966. The submarines crossed the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the whole Atlantic Ocean, entered the Pacific Ocean and finished the voyage at Kamchatka. K-133 passed around 21,000 miles for 52 days of that voyage.

K-133 performed 2 patrol missions (103 days total) in 1966–1968, 2 patrol missions (93 days total) in 1971–1976, 1 patrol mission (48 days) in 1977 and 1 patrol mission in 1983–1986. The submarine was decommissioned from the order of battle on 30 May 1989. She lied up in Postovaya Bay (Sovetskaya Gavan) as of August 2006. K-11 passed 168,889 miles (21,926 operational hours) since placed in service.

====K-181====
Laid down 15 November 1961, launched 7 September 1962, and commissioned 27 December 1962.

====K-115====
Laid down 4 April 1962, launched 22 October 1962, and commissioned 31 December 1962.

====K-159====

On 30 August 2003, the submarine K-159 sank during stormy weather while being towed to the shipyard in Snezhnogorsk, Murmansk Oblast for scrapping (K-159 was decommissioned in 1987.) Nine sailors died in the accident and one was rescued. K-159 was found and investigated by Russian deep-sea vehicles the same day in the point 69°22.64&#x27;N, 33°49.51&#x27;E (Barents Sea, 2.4 miles from Kildin Island) at a depth of 248 m. K-159 performed 9 missions and passed 212,618 miles since June 1963.

====K-42====
Laid down 28 November 1962, launched 17 August 1963, and commissioned 30 November 1963. Was located next to K-431 during the nuclear fuel accident during 10 August 1985. As a result of the accident, K-42 was also deemed damaged beyond repair and decommissioned.

====K-50====
K-50 was laid down on 14 February 1963 (using some mechanisms and equipment from unfinished submarine of project P627A), launched on 16 December 1963, and commissioned 17 July 1964. K-60 entered service with the Northern Fleet (given to 3rd division of nuclear submarines which was a part of 1st submarine flotilla, based in Malaya Lopatka of Zapadnaya Litsa Fjord) on 6 August 1964. The submarine was given to 17th submarine division based in Gremikha in 1969 (17th submarine division became a part of 11th submarine flotilla in 1974).

The submarine performed a number of cruises including participation in naval exercise &quot;Ograda&quot; (&quot;Protective fence&quot;) during 4 March 1965 – 4 April 1965, patrol mission in North Atlantic in July 1965, two patrol missions (161 days) in 1969–1973, one patrol mission in 1978 (51 days), one patrol mission in December 1983 – January 1984. Besides combat duties K-50 took place in training cruises and tests of new equipment also. Refueling was made in September 1975 during a medium repair. K-50 was renamed as K-60 in 1982.

She was decommissioned from the operational order of battle on 19 April 1990 and stored at Gremikha Bay. Between 3 and 6 September 2006 the submarine was transported by heavy lift ship &quot;Transshelf&quot; (belonged to Dutch Dockwise Shipping B.V. company) to Dockyard No. 10 (SRZ-10) in Polyarny for further scrapping. K-50 covered 171,456 miles (24,760 operational hours) since placed in service.

===Project 645===

====K-27====
K-27 was laid down on 15 June 1958 and launched on 1 April 1962. The submarine was commissioned on 30 October 1963 after full-scale builders sea trials and official tests. Design task was assigned to OKB-16, one of the two predecessors (the other being SKB-143) of the famous Malachite Central Design Bureau, which would eventually become one of the three Soviet/Russian submarine design centers, along with Rubin Design Bureau and Lazurit Central Design Bureau (&quot;Lazurit&quot; is the Russian word for lazurite).

The first patrol mission of the experimental submarine to Central Atlantic was performed between 21 April – 12 June 1964 (52 days). Captain of K-27, captain 1st rank I.I. Gulyaev was awarded with the Hero of the Soviet Union for mission success and record of submarine continuous underwater stay. The second patrol mission to the Mediterranean Sea took place between 29 June – 30 August 1965 (60 days), K-27 detected and performed a training attack with a nuclear torpedo against USS &quot;Randolph&quot; aircraft carrier during NATO naval maneuvers off Sardinia. US carrier force could only detect K-27 when she obtained range to the training target after the &quot;torpedo attack&quot; but Soviet captain P.F. Leonov skillfully disengaged. K-27 passed 12,425 miles (including 12,278 miles undersea) during the first cruise and 15,000 miles during the second one. K-27 entered service with the Red Banner Northern Fleet (given to 17th submarine division, based in Gremikha) on 7 September 1965 as the test submarine.

An emergency in the port-side reactor took place on 24 May 1968 in the Barents Sea during trials of submerged K-27 at full speed (AR-1 automatic control rod raised up spontaneously and the reactor power decreased from 83% to 7% during 60–90 sec). The responsible officers informed the command before trials that port-side reactor was not tested yet after small failure took place on 13 October 1967 but their warnings were not taken into consideration. The emergency was accompanied by gamma activity excursion in the reactor compartment (up to 150 R/hour and higher) and spread of radioactive gas along the other compartments. All crewmembers (124 men) were irradiated, and the main reason according to some crewmembers&#x27; memoirs was the fact that the submarine captain, Captain 1st Rank P.F. Leonov, believed in the reliability of a new type of the reactor too much, so he didn&#x27;t give the order to resurface immediately, didn&#x27;t inform crew members in other compartments about radiation hazards on board and even allowed the crew to have a usual dinner. A radiation alarm was transmitted only after a chemical officer and a doctor requested it. K-27 resurfaced and returned from training area to its home base using the starboard reactor. The submarine was placed at pier in Severomorsk and a depot ship continuously piped steam to the submarine to avoid cooling of heat-transfer metal in the reactor. The most heavily irradiated ten men (holders from the reactor compartment) were transported by aircraft to Leningrad 1st naval hospital next day but four of them (V. Voevoda, V. Gritsenko, V. Kulikov and A. Petrov) died within a month. Electrician I. Ponomarenko died on watch in the emergency reactor compartment on 29 May. More than 30 sailors participated in accident elimination died between 1968 and 2003 because of over exposure to radiation and the Soviet government held back the truth about the tragic consequences of that reactor emergency for many years.

K-27 was tied up in Gremikha Bay from 20 June 1968, with cooling reactors and different experimental works done on board, until 1973, when rebuilding or replacement of the port-side reactor was judged to be too expensive. The submarine was decommissioned on 1 February 1979 and her reactor compartment was filled with special solidifying mixture of furfurol and bitumen in summer 1981 (the work was performed by Severodvinsk shipyard No. 893 &quot;Zvezdochka&quot;). K-27 was towed to a special training area in the Kara Sea and scuttled there on 6 September 1982 in the point 72°31&#x27;N 55°30&#x27;E (north-east coast of Novaya Zemlya, Stepovoy Bay) at a depth of only 33 m (in contravention of an IAEA requirement that the submarine be scuttled in water at least 3,000–4,000 m deep).

<text>Interaction design, often abbreviated as IxD, is &quot;the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services.&quot; While interaction design has an interest in form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior. Rather than analyzing how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This element of interaction design is what characterizes IxD as a design field, as opposed to a science or engineering field.

Interaction design borrows from a wide range of fields like psychology, human-computer interaction, information architecture, and user research to create designs that are tailored to the needs and preferences of users. This involves understanding the context in which the product will be used, identifying user goals and behaviors, and developing design solutions that are responsive to user needs and expectations.

While disciplines such as software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical stakeholders, interaction design is focused on meeting the needs and optimizing the experience of users, within relevant technical or business constraints.

== History ==
The term &quot;interaction design&quot; was coined by Bill Moggridge and Bill Verplank in the mid-1980s, but it took 10 years before the concept started to take hold. To Verplank, it was an adaptation of the computer science term &quot;user interface design&quot; for the industrial design profession. To Moggridge, it was an improvement over &quot;soft-face&quot;, which he had coined in 1984 to refer to the application of industrial design to products containing software.

The earliest programs in design for interactive technologies were the Visible Language Workshop, started by Muriel Cooper at MIT in 1975, and the Interactive Telecommunications Program founded at NYU in 1979 by Martin Elton and later headed by Red Burns.

The first academic program officially named &quot;Interaction Design&quot; was established at Carnegie Mellon University in 1994, as a Master of Design in Interaction Design. At the outset, the program focused mainly on screen interfaces, before shifting to a greater emphasis on the &quot;big picture&quot; aspects of interaction—people, organizations, culture, service and system.

In 1990, Gillian Crampton Smith founded the Computer-Related Design MA at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London, which in 2005 was renamed Design Interactions, headed by Anthony Dunne. In 2001, Crampton Smith helped found the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII), a specialized institute in Olivetti&#x27;s hometown in Northern Italy, dedicated solely to interaction design. In 2007, after IDII closed due to a lack of funding, some of the people originally involved with IDII set up the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID), in Denmark. After Ivrea, Crampton Smith and Philip Tabor added the Interaction Design (IxD) track in the Visual and Multimedia Communication at the University of Venice, Italy.

In 1998, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research founded The Interactive Institute—a Swedish research institute in the field of interaction design.

==Methodologies==

===Goal-oriented design===
Goal-oriented design (or Goal-Directed design) &quot;is concerned with satisfying the needs and desires of the users of a product or service.&quot;

Alan Cooper argues in &quot;The Inmates Are Running the Asylum&quot; that we need a new approach to solving interactive software-based problems. The problems with designing computer interfaces are fundamentally different from those that do not include software (e.g., hammers). Cooper introduces the concept of cognitive friction, which is when the interface of a design is complex and difficult to use, and behaves inconsistently and unexpectedly, possessing different modes.

Alternatively, interfaces can be designed to serve the needs of the service/product provider. User needs may be poorly served by this approach.

===Usability===
Usability answers the question &quot;can someone use this interface?&quot;. Jakob Nielsen describes usability as the quality attribute that describes how usable the interface is. Shneiderman proposes principles for designing more usable interfaces called &quot;Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design&quot;—which are well-known heuristics for creating usable systems.

===Personas===
Personas are archetypes that describe the various goals and observed behaviour patterns among users.

A persona encapsulates critical behavioural data in a way that both designers and stakeholders can understand, remember, and relate to. Personas use storytelling to engage users&#x27; social and emotional aspects, which helps designers to either visualize the best product behaviour or see why the recommended design is successful.

===Cognitive dimensions===
The cognitive dimensions framework provides a vocabulary to evaluate and modify design solutions. Cognitive dimensions offer a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality, rather than an in-depth, detailed description. They provide a common vocabulary for discussing notation, user interface or programming language design.

Dimensions provide high-level descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it: examples include &quot;consistency&quot;, &quot;error-proneness&quot;, &quot;hard mental operations&quot;, &quot;viscosity&quot; and &quot;premature commitment&quot;. These concepts aid the creation of new designs from existing ones through &quot;design maneuvers&quot; that alter the design within a particular dimension.

=== Affective interaction design ===
Designers must be aware of elements that influence user emotional responses. For instance, products must convey positive emotions while avoiding negative ones. Other important aspects include motivational, learning, creative, social and persuasive influences. One method that can help convey such aspects is for example, the use of dynamic icons, animations and sound to help communicate, creating a sense of interactivity. Interface aspects such as fonts, color palettes and graphical layouts can influence acceptance. Studies showed that affective aspects can affect perceptions of usability.

Emotion and pleasure theories exist to explain interface responses. These include Don Norman&#x27;s emotional design model, Patrick Jordan&#x27;s pleasure model and McCarthy and Wright&#x27;s Technology as Experience framework.

==Five dimensions==
The concept of dimensions of interaction design were introduced in Moggridge&#x27;s book &quot;Designing Interactions.&quot; Crampton Smith wrote that interaction design draws on four existing design languages, 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D. Kevin Silver later proposed a fifth dimension, behaviour.

===Words===

This dimension defines interactions: words are the element that users interact with.

===Visual representations===

Visual representations are the elements of an interface that the user perceives; these may include but are not limited to &quot;typography, diagrams, icons, and other graphics&quot;.

===Physical objects or space===

This dimension defines the objects or space &quot;with which or within which users interact&quot;.

===Time===

The time during which the user interacts with the interface. An example of this includes &quot;content that changes over time such as sound, video or animation&quot;.

===Behavior===

Behavior defines how users respond to the interface. Users may have different reactions in this interface.

==Interaction Design Association==
The Interaction Design Association was created in 2003 to serve the community. The organization has over 80,000 members and more than 173 local groups. IxDA hosts Interaction the annual interaction design conference, and the Interaction Awards.

==Related disciplines==
;Industrial design
:The core principles of industrial design overlap with those of interaction design. Industrial designers use their knowledge of physical form, color, aesthetics, human perception and desire, and usability to create a fit of an object with the person using it.

;Human factors and ergonomics
:Certain basic principles of ergonomics provide grounding for interaction design. These include anthropometry, biomechanics, kinesiology, physiology and psychology as they relate to human behavior in the built environment.

;Cognitive psychology
:Certain basic principles of cognitive psychology provide grounding for interaction design. These include mental models, mapping, interface metaphors, and affordances. Many of these are laid out in Donald Norman&#x27;s influential book &quot;The Design of Everyday Things.&quot;

;Human–computer interaction
:Academic research in human–computer interaction (HCI) includes methods for describing and testing the usability of interacting with an interface, such as cognitive dimensions and the cognitive walkthrough.

;Design research
:Interaction designers are typically informed through iterative cycles of user research. User research is used to identify the needs, motivations and behaviors of end users. They design with an emphasis on user goals and experience, and evaluate designs in terms of usability and affective influence.

;Architecture
:As interaction designers increasingly deal with ubiquitous computing, urban informatics and urban computing, the architects&#x27; ability to make, place, and create context becomes a point of contact between the disciplines.

;User interface design
:Like user interface design and experience design, interaction design is often associated with the design of system interfaces in a variety of media but concentrates on the aspects of the interface that define and present its behavior over time, with a focus on developing the system to respond to the user&#x27;s experience and not the other way around.

<text>Islamey: Oriental Fantasy (), is a composition for piano by Russian composer Mily Balakirev written in 1869. Harold C. Schonberg noted that &quot;Islamey&quot; was &quot;at one time…considered the most difficult of all piano pieces and is still one of the knucklebusters.&quot; Its difficulty has led to the creation of numerous ossias (alternative passages) and made it popular as a virtuosic showpiece.

==Composition==
Balakirev, a committed nationalist whose music was influenced by Russian traditions, was inspired to write the piece after a trip to the Caucasus, as he relates in a letter:

...the majestic beauty of luxuriant nature there and the beauty of the inhabitants that harmonises with it – all these things together made a deep impression on me... Since I interested myself in the vocal music there, I made the acquaintance of a Circassian prince, who frequently came to me and played folk tunes on his instrument, that was something like a violin. One of them, called Islamey, a dance-tune, pleased me extraordinarily and with a view to the work I had in mind on Tamara I began to arrange it for the piano. The second theme was communicated to me in Moscow by an Armenian actor, who came from the Crimea and is, as he assured me, well known among the Crimean Tatars. (Letter to Eduard Reiss (1851–1911), 1892)

The piece was composed in the course of one month in 1869, in stark contrast to Balakirev&#x27;s usual habit of taking sometimes years to complete a work. In the score he noted that he started the work on 9/21 August in Moscow, and completed it on 13/25 September in Saint Petersburg. Balakirev revised the work in 1902. It is divided into three distinct parts, an opening (&quot;Allegro agitato&quot;), which introduces the main theme, a middle (&quot;Tranquillo – Andantino espressivo&quot;) that introduces an entirely new theme (both described in the above quote), and a third (&quot;Allegro vivo – Presto furioso&quot;), which returns to the main theme.

==Difficulty==
The many existing editions have numerous alternative passages (ossias) – most are easier, some are more difficult. This technical difficulty made it a favourite with virtuosos such as Nikolai Rubinstein (who premiered the piece), Franz Liszt, and in recorded history, Simon Barere, Julius Katchen, György Cziffra, Boris Berezovsky, Mikhail Pletnev, Ivo Pogorelić, and Lang Lang. Balakirev, considered a virtuoso pianist in his time, once admitted that there were passages in the piece that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t manage.&quot; In addition, Alexander Scriabin seriously damaged his right hand fanatically practicing the piece along with Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Réminiscences de Don Juan&quot;, though the injury eventually healed.

==Legacy and influences==

&quot;Islamey&quot; has had a lasting influence on piano solo music; Ravel once remarked to a friend that his goal in writing &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot; was to compose a piece that was &quot;more difficult than Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Islamey.&quot;&quot; This turned out to be &quot;Scarbo&quot;, the third piece in the suite. Alexander Borodin included quotations from the piece in his opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, while Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov did the same in &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. The piece has been twice arranged for orchestra, by Alfredo Casella shortly before Balakirev&#x27;s death, and by Sergei Lyapunov. Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra recorded Casella&#x27;s orchestration in stereo on February 26, 1961, for Columbia Records.

Recent musicological work has shown that the melodies that Balakirev preserved in this work are still present in folk music in the former USSR. For instance, the first theme has been found to be a variety of the &quot;Lezginka&quot; from Kabardino-Balkaria, which differs notably from Balakirev&#x27;s work in its time signature. The second theme has been demonstrated to have the origins as related to Balakirev, namely that of a Tatar love song. Balakirev himself indicated in the score that the coda should be played similarly to the Russian Tropak, again a traditional Russian tune.

==Recordings==
Notable recordings include: Simon Barere (1947, APR), Vladimir Horowitz (1950, Sony/BMG), Emil Gilels (1951, DOREMI), Julius Katchen (1958, Decca), György Cziffra (1957 &amp; 1970, EMI), Boris Berezovsky (1996, Teldec) and Mikhail Pletnev (2000, DG).

<text>Cecil is a pure object-oriented programming language that was developed by Craig Chambers at the University of Washington in 1992 to be part of the Vortex project there. Cecil has many similarities to other object-oriented languages, most notably Objective-C, Modula-3, and Self. The main goals of the project were extensibility, orthogonality, efficiency, and ease-of-use.

The language supports multiple dispatch and multimethods, dynamic inheritance, and optional static type checking. Unlike most other OOP systems, Cecil allows subtyping and code inheritance to be used separately, allowing run-time or external extension of object classes or instances. Like Objective-C, all object services in Cecil are invoked by message passing, and the language supports run-time class identification. These features allow Cecil to support dynamic, exploratory programming styles. Parameterized types and methods (generics, polymorphism), garbage collection, and delegation are also supported. Cecil also supports a module mechanism for isolating independent libraries or packages. Cecil does not presently support threads or any other form of concurrency. A standard library for Cecil is also available and includes various collection, utility, system, I/O, and GUI classes.

The Diesel language was the successor of Cecil.

<text>Don&#x27;t Fight It is the debut album by Canadian rock band Red Rider, released in 1979 in Canada. &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot; sold more than 100,000 copies in Canada and earned Cochrane and Red Rider their first gold album certification award and was later certified platinum. A United States version with a modified track list, dropping &quot;Talkin&#x27; to Myself&quot; and reordering the other tracks, was released in 1980.

The album was re-issued on CD July 29, 1994. The CD release restored the track &quot;Talkin&#x27; to Myself&quot; which was dropped on the initial vinyl release in the United States. Another newly remastered version was released in the UK in 2010 by Lemon Records.

The album reached number 146 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Pop Albums chart while &quot;White Hot&quot; reached number 20 on the Canadian charts and number 48 on the Pop Singles chart in 1980 and &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot; reached number 75.

The song &quot;White Hot&quot; is about poet Arthur Rimbaud and his travels through Africa. It also has a cult following on YouTube.

<text>The Victor class, Soviet designations Project 671 &quot;Yorsh,Project 671RT &quot;Syomga and Project 671RTM/RTMK &quot;Shchuka&quot;, (NATO reporting names Victor I, Victor II and Victor III, respectively), are series of nuclear-powered attack submarines built in the Soviet Union and operated by the Soviet Navy. Since the 1960s, 48 units were built in total, of which the last remaining are currently in service with the Russian Navy. The Victor-class submarines featured a teardrop shape, allowing them to travel at high speed. These vessels were primarily designed to protect Soviet surface fleets and to attack American ballistic missile submarines. Project 671 began in 1959 with the design task assigned to SKB-143 (one of the predecessors of the Malakhit Marine Engineering Bureau).

==Versions==

===Project 671 &quot;Yorsh&quot; (Victor I)===

Soviet designation Project 671 &quot;Yorsh&quot; (ruffe)—was the initial type that entered service in 1967; 16 were produced. Each had six torpedo tubes for launching Type 53 torpedoes and SS-N-15 anti-submarine missiles and mines could also be released. Subs had a capacity of 24 tube-launched weapons or 48 mines (or a combination). They were long. All disposed.

===Project 671RT &quot;Syomga&quot; (Victor II)===

Soviet designation Project 671RT &quot;Syomga&quot; (atlantic salmon)—entered service in 1972; seven were produced in the 1970s. These were originally designated Uniform class by NATO. They had similar armament to the Victor I class and were the first Soviet submarines to introduce raft mounting for acoustic quieting. Production was truncated due to a decision to develop the improved Victor III class. They were long. All disposed.

===Project 671RTM/RTMK &quot;Shchuka&quot; (Victor III)===

Soviet designation Project 671RTM/RTMK &quot;Shchuka&quot; (pike)—entered service in 1979; 25 were produced until 1991. Quieter than previous Soviet submarines, these ships had four tubes for launching SS-N-21 or SS-N-15 missiles and Type 53 torpedoes, plus another two tubes for launching SS-N-16 missiles and Type 65 torpedoes. 24 tube-launched weapons or 36 mines could be on board. The Victor III class caused a minor furor in NATO intelligence agencies at its introduction because of the distinctive pod on the vertical stern-plane. Speculation immediately mounted that the pod was the housing for some sort of exotic silent propulsion system, possibly a magnetohydrodynamic drive unit. Another theory proposed that it was some sort of weapon system. In the end, the pod was identified as a hydrodynamic housing for a reelable towed passive sonar array; the system was subsequently incorporated into the and SSNs. In October 1983 the towed array of , a Victor III operating west of Bermuda, became tangled with the towed array of US frigate . &quot;K-324&quot; was forced to surface, allowing NATO forces to photograph the pod in its deployed state. The Victor-III class was continuously improved during construction and late production models have a superior acoustic performance. They were long. 21 disposed.

==Incidents==

* In 1981 collided with a Victor III-class submarine—&quot;K-324&quot;—while attempting to photograph the odd pod on the back. The event was covered up by the Reagan Administration and never made public, though it nearly cost the lives of the sailors on USS &quot;Drum&quot;. The incident was declassified and disclosed by the Clinton Administration in February 1993.
* On 21 March 1984, &quot;K-314&quot; collided with the aircraft carrier in the Sea of Japan. Neither ship was significantly damaged. 
* The Soviet cargo ship &quot;Bratstvo&quot; collided with the Soviet submarine &quot;K-53&quot; of the Victor I-class in position Latitude 35 deg 55 min North and Longitude 005 deg 00 min West, at the exit from the Gibraltar Strait in Alboran Sea, on 18 (as per ship&#x27;s time) or 19 (as per submarine time) September 1984.
* On 6 September 2006, the Victor III-class &quot;Daniil Moskovskiy&quot; suffered an electronics fire while in the Barents Sea, killing two crew members. The boat was 16 years old and was overdue for overhaul. It was towed back to Vidyayevo. She continued to serve into the latter 2010s and was reportedly formally decommissioned on 28 October 2022.

==In media==
* A depiction of a Victor III-class submarine (Valentin Zukovsky&#x27;s nephew Nikolai&#x27;s own submarine) was used prominently in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; as a key element in the film&#x27;s antagonists (Elektra King and Viktor &quot;Renard&quot; Zokas) plan.

<doc id="527962" wikidata="Q273779" url="?curid=527962" title="Saint-Louis, Senegal">
<text>Saint-Louis () or Saint Louis (), is the capital of Senegal&#x27;s Saint-Louis Region. Located in the northwest of Senegal, near the mouth of the Senegal River, and north of Senegal&#x27;s capital city Dakar. It had a population of 254,171 in 2023. Saint-Louis was the capital of the French colony of Senegal from 1673 until 1902 and French West Africa from 1895 until 1902, when the capital was moved to Dakar. From 1920 to 1957, it also served as the capital of the neighboring colony of Mauritania.

The town was an important economic center during the period of French West Africa, but it is less important now. Nonetheless, it still has important industries, including tourism, a commercial center, sugar production, and fishing. The tourism industry is in part due to the city being listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. However, the city is also vulnerable to climate change—where sea level rise is expected to threaten the city center and potential damage historical parts of the city; according to a Senegalese government study, up to 80% of the city could be at risk of flooding by 2080. Moreover, other issues such as overfishing are causing ripple effects in the local economy.

==Etymology==
Saint Louis () is named after LouisIX, a canonized 13th-century king of France. Obliquely, the name also honored LouisXIV, the reigning king of France at the time of the island&#x27;s settlement in 1659. It was originally known as Saint Louis of the Fort (&quot;&quot;) after its stronghold and to distinguish it from other places of the same name. The Langue de Barbarie takes its name from the French for &quot;Barbary Tongue&quot;, after an old name for the land of the Berbers.

The local name Ndar or N&#x27;dar is Wolof for a kind of island and has been borne by the island since before the French settlement. Ndar Tout or Toute is a Gallicized form of a Wolof name meaning &quot;Little&quot; or &quot;Lesser Saint Louis&quot;. The neighborhood of Guet Ndar takes its name from a Wolof word for &quot;pasture&quot;.

==Geography==

Saint-Louis is situated in northern Senegal, on the border with Mauritania, although the nearest border crossing is at Rosso, up the Senegal River.

The heart of the old colonial city is located on a narrow island a little more than long but only about wide. The island lies in the Senegal River. It is north of its mouth, but is only separated from the Atlantic Ocean to its west by the Langue de Barbarie, a wide sand spit. The Langue de Barbarie is the location of the seaside neighborhoods Ndar Toute and Guet Ndar. On the mainland, the east bank of the river is the site of Sor, an older settlement now considered a suburb of Saint-Louis. It is nearly surrounded by tidal marshes.

Three characteristics give Saint-Louis its distinctive geographic appearance: the Sahel, the marshes and the Langue de Barbarie.

Part of the Sahel, a transitional desertic band that separates &quot;[...] the dunes of the Sahara from the baobabs of the savanna&quot;, Saint-Louis&#x27; landscape is characterized by occasional acacias and is disturbed by sand storms during the dry season.

The marshes are flood basins that form during the rainy season when the river overflows into the countryside, creating ponds and stretches of mangroves that attract birds like flamingos and pelicans.

The Langue de Barbarie, over a stretch of , separates the lower Senegal River from the Atlantic Ocean. Its vegetation mainly consists of Filao trees, propagated to prevent soil erosion in sandy and salty soils.

===Natural sites===
Among Saint-Louis&#x27; numerous natural sites are the National Park of the Langue de Barbarie, the National Park of the Birds of Djoudj, the Fauna Reserve of Gueumbeul, beaches like that of the Langue de Barbarie, the colonial waterworks at Makhana, the palace of at Richard-Toll, the Diama Dam, and various hunting lodges on the south side of the Senegal River.

This park, which is 20 square kilometres large, occupies the southern point of the Langue de Barbarie, the estuary of the Senegal river and part of the continent. It hosts thousands of water birds like cormorants, brushes, pink flamingos, pelicans, herons and ducks each year.

The world&#x27;s third largest ornithological park, it is located 60 kilometers north of Saint-Louis. This park occupies over 120 km2 and includes part of the river, and many lakes, basins, and marshes. About 3 million migrating birds of 400 species visit it each year.

Located at a dozen kilometers south of the city of Saint-Louis, this reserve has an area of 7 square kilometres and shelters birds and endangered species such as the dama gazelle, the Patas monkey and the African spurred tortoise.

===Climate===
Saint-Louis has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). It only has two seasons, the rainy season from June to October, characterized by heat, humidity and storms, and the dry season from November to May, characterized by cool ocean breeze and dust from the Harmattan winds. A 2011 documentary described Saint-Louis as the African city most threatened by rising sea levels. Flooding is becoming worse, and by 2080 80% of the city will face flood risks.

==History==

===Founding===

A Wolof settlement at what is now known as Guet Ndar dates from around 1450 and was a meeting and departure point for Muslim pilgrims traveling to Mecca in Arabia. Portuguese, Dutch, and English traders visited the area over the next two centuries but the first nearby colonial fortification was erected by the French in 1638 on Bocos Island, about away.

Repeated flooding prompted the removal of the fort to the island known to locals as Ndar in 1659. The island was uninhabited at the time, supposedly because the local people believed it to be haunted by spirits. The Diagne of Sor, the local leader, permitted French settlement on the island for annual payments of &quot;three pieces of blue cloth, a measure of scarlet cloth, seven long iron bars, and 10 pints of eau de vie.&quot;
===Colonial capital===

The fortification permitted its factory to command foreign trade along the Senegal River. Slaves, gold, hides, beeswax, ambergris and, later, gum arabic were exported. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, British forces captured Senegal in 1758. In February 1779, French forces recaptured Saint-Louis. In the late 18th century, Saint-Louis had about 5,000 inhabitants, not counting an indeterminate number of slaves in transit.

Between 1659 and 1779, nine chartered companies succeeded one another in administering Saint-Louis. As in Gorée, a Franco-African Creole, or Métis, merchant community characterized by the famous &quot;signares&quot;, or bourgeois women entrepreneurs, grew up in Saint-Louis during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Métis were important to the economic, social, cultural and political life of the city. They created a distinctive urban culture characterized by public displays of elegance, refined entertainment and popular festivities. They controlled most of the up-country river trade and they financed the principal Catholic institutions. A Métis mayor was first designated by the Governor in 1778. Civic franchise was further consolidated in 1872, when Saint-Louis became a French &quot;commune&quot;.

After the decline of the Atlantic slave trade after 1790, the trade in gum arabic replaced it as the major economic engine of Saint Louis. Trade was increasingly concentrated in the lower river valley and the desert-side &quot;escales&quot;, rather than further upriver in Gajaaga as it had been previously. The city was again captured by the British during the Napoleonic Wars, and returned to France in 1817. Facing a near-total dependence on gum, the French authorities tried to promote plantation agriculture in Waalo from 1819 to 1830, but this failed. At the same time, Saint Louis grew massively during this period in both population in commercial activity.

Throughout the 19th century, the French periodically warred with the Emirate of Trarza and other Hassani tribal states, which disrupted the flow of gum. Nevertheless, with the removal of trade restrictions in 1848 and in 1853, exports soared. When war again broke out in 1854, the Arab Emirs forbade the Berber &quot;zwaya&quot; merchants from selling to the French, but this had little effect. In the 1855 Battle of Leybar Bridge a small force of French Marines defended the town from a large Trarza force. With the French victory in 1858, they were able to set the terms of trade on the river.

Louis Faidherbe, who became the Governor of the Colony of Senegal in 1854, contributed greatly to the development and modernization of Saint Louis. His large-scale projects included the building of bridges, provisioning of fresh drinking water, and the construction of an overland telegraph line to Dakar. Saint-Louis became capital of the federation of French West African colonies in 1895, but relinquished this role to Dakar in 1902.
Saint-Louis&#x27;s fortunes began to wane as those of Dakar waxed. Access to its port became increasingly awkward in the age of the steamship and the completion of the Dakar-Saint Louis railroad in 1885 meant that up-country trade effectively circumvented its port. Large French firms, many from the city of Bordeaux, took over the new commercial networks of the interior, marginalizing the Métis traders in the process. Saint-Louis nonetheless maintained its status as capital of the Colony of Senegal even after Dakar assumed the role of capital of the French West Africa federation. The colonial institutions set up in the city in the 19th century, such as the Muslim Tribunal and the School for Chiefs&#x27; Sons, were to play important roles in the history of French Africa. Though relatively small in size (population of 10,000 in 1826; 23,000 in 1914, and 39,000 in 1955) Saint-Louis dominated Senegalese politics throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, not least because of its numerous political parties and associations and its independent newspapers.

===Independence===
Following independence, when Dakar became sole capital of the country, Saint-Louis slipped into a state of lethargy. As its French population and military departed, many of the town&#x27;s shops, offices and businesses closed. The loss of jobs, human potential, and investment caused its economic decline. The loss of its past status meant less recognition and lack of interest from the colony&#x27;s officials and, after Senegal&#x27;s independence, from the Senegalese government. When its most famous political son, the French-educated lawyer Lamine Guèye, died in 1968, the city lost its strongest proponent.

Since 1993, the city has hosted the Saint Louis Jazz Festival, a major tourist draw.

==Environmental issues==

Between 2016 and 2017, Saint-Louis experienced a large decline in the catch of fish brought in, causing ripple effects on nutrition and food supply in the country, where 75% of animal protein comes from fish. Fisherman from the community spend twice as much time for catching smaller hauls, and are now competing with foreign fishing vessels.

Rising sea levels, as well as water levels flowing out of the Senegal River now threaten the low-lying islands which make up the city. An ill-fated 2003 canal project exacerbated flooding issues, leading to submerged neighborhoods. In June 2008, Alioune Badiane of the United Nations&#x27; UN-Habitat agency designated Saint-Louis as &quot;the city most threatened by rising sea levels in the whole of Africa&quot;, citing climate change and a failed 2004 river and tidal canal project as the cause. According to a Senegalese government study, up to 80% of the city could be at risk of flooding by 2080. As of 2020, the coast of the community has eroded by 1–2 meters a year.

==Economy==
Saint Louis has economically declined since the transfer of the capital to Dakar, but has remained an important tourist and trading center. The city&#x27;s economy, though not entirely recovered, is gradually reviving.

The city was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 and cultural tourism has become an engine of growth. As a result, a process of gentrification has set in, with many historic buildings on the island being turned into restaurants and hotels.

Beyond tourism, Saint-Louis is also a commercial and an industrial centre for sugar production. Its other economic activities are fishing, irrigated alluvial agriculture, pastoral farming, trading and exportation of peanut skins. It is important to note that each of these economic activities is assured by a particular ethnic group. The Wolofs and Lebous who are the main inhabitants of Saint-Louis are mostly fishermen that live in fishing communities like Guet-Ndar on the Langue de Barbarie. The Fulas live in the inland and practice pastoral farming. The Maures who are migrants from Mauritania (Saint-Louis is less than south of the border with Mauritania) are mostly merchants, traders and shopkeepers found everywhere in Saint Louis.

==Culture==

Culture constitutes an important part of Saint-Louis&#x27; economy. The city preserves much of its 19th-century morphology, reminiscent of other cities of the &quot;Creole Atlantic&quot;: Bahia, Cartagena, Havana and New Orleans. Thanks to its distinctive appearance, numerous sites of attraction and its international music festivals and cultural exhibitions, Saint-Louis attracts many tourists each year.

Saint-Louis remains the most characteristically French colonial destination in West Africa along with Gorée Island.

===Museums===
Saint-Louis&#x27; Research Center and Documentation Museum of Senegal offers interesting panoramas of Senegal&#x27;s history and ethnic movements over the years, expositions of traditional clothes and musical instruments, etc.
===Events and festivals===

Saint Louis is famous for its urban culture. The heritage of the signares lives on in the city&#x27;s many festivals and its cultivated sense of public display, and it is helping Saint-Louis emerge from decades of neglect. &quot;Fanals&quot;, which are night-time processions of giant paper lanterns, take place at Christmas time.

The Saint-Louis Jazz Festival is the most important jazz festival in Africa. Jazz first became popular in the 1930s when records produced in Cuba were aired on the radio. After World War II, visiting U.S. GIs popularized jazz bands and by the 1950s local groups had adopted a &quot;Cuban&quot; sound. Another music festival, 1, 2, 3 musiques, exhibits various genres of music.

The Festival Métissons, held for the first time in 2010, is a grassroots music festival organized by local communities and small businesses. Every edition sports international, national and local musical talent.

The annual reggata, or pirogue race organized by teams of fishermen from Guet-Ndar, takes place on the &quot;little branch&quot; of the river, between Ndar Island and the Langue de Barbarie.

The Magal of the Niari Rakas, a yearly commemoration of Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacké&#x27;s (the founder of Mouridism) two prayers in the Governor&#x27;s Palace in 1895, is the city&#x27;s largest religious gathering.

===UNESCO World Heritage Site===
Saint-Louis&#x27; characteristic colonial architecture along with its regular town plan, its location on an island at the mouth of the Senegal River and the system of quays, gives Saint-Louis the distinctive appearance and identity that have raised the island to the rank of world heritage since 2000. The Island of Saint-Louis is inscribed on the World Heritage list on the basis of criteria II and IV:

Criterion II The historic town of Saint-Louis exhibits an important exchange of values and influences on the development of education and culture, architecture, craftsmanship, and services in a large part of West Africa.

<doc id="527973" wikidata="Q4802866" url="?curid=527973" title="As Far as Siam">
<text>As Far as Siam is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Red Rider. The majority of the album was recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles and produced by Richard Landis; two tracks were produced in Toronto by Michael James Jackson. The album was released by Capitol Records on June 30, 1981.

The album reached #65 on Billboard&#x27;s Pop Albums chart in 1981. The single &quot;What Have You Got to do (To Get Off Tonight)&quot; peaked at #16 on the Canadian charts.

== Background and writing ==
&quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot;, the band&#x27;s most famous song, is about what composer Tom Cochrane saw as an alarming rise of anti-Semitism in the 1970s, and was inspired by a book he read about Raoul Wallenberg. The song is featured in the 1985 high-school wrestling movie &quot;Vision Quest&quot;, the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, the &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; episode &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; and on an episode of &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;. The beginning of the song is used as a part of a bump for the Cincinnati radio station, WEBN. It is also the inspiration for Kurt Angle&#x27;s entrance theme in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. It is also used as American Mixed Martial Artist Dan Henderson&#x27;s and Randy Couture&#x27;s entrance theme as of late. American guitarist Gary Hoey covered &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; on his 2006 album &quot;American Made&quot;.

The distinctive guitar solo in &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; was performed by Kenny Greer on a lap steel, also seen in the song&#x27;s music video.

<text>The is a compact car that has been manufactured by the Japanese automaker Subaru since 1992. It was introduced as a replacement for the Leone, with the predecessor&#x27;s EA series engines replaced by the new EJ series. It is now in its sixth generation.

Subaru has offered a 5-door hatchback body variant since 2008. The firm also offered a coupé from 1995 until 2001, a 4-door sedan up to the fifth generation, and a 5-door wagon from the Impreza&#x27;s introduction which was replaced by a hatchback with the third generation in 2008. Mainstream versions have received &quot;boxer&quot; flat-four engines ranging from 1.5- to 2.5-liters, with the performance-oriented Impreza WRX and WRX STI models upgraded with the addition of turbochargers. Since the third generation series, some markets have adopted the abbreviated [[Subaru WRX (VA)|Subaru WRX]] name for these high-performance variants. The first three generations of Impreza were also available with an off-road appearance non-SUV package called the [[Subaru Outback#Outback Sport|Outback Sport]], exclusive to the North American market. For the fourth generation, this appearance package was raised up to be subcompact crossover SUV and renamed the [[Subaru Impreza|XV]] ([[Subaru Impreza|Crosstrek]] in North America), and is sold internationally. Colloquially, the car is sometimes referred to as Scooby.

Subaru has offered front- and all-wheel drive layouts for the Impreza. Since the late-1990s, some markets have restricted sales to the all-wheel drive model, putting the Impreza in a unique selling proposition in the global compact class, which is usually characterized by front-wheel drive. Japanese models remain available in both configurations.

A 2019 iSeeCars study named the Impreza as the lowest-depreciating sedan in the United States after five years.


== First generation (GM, GC, GF; 1992) ==

Announced on 22 October 1992, the Impreza was released in Japan in November and offered in either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) versions and as a four-door sedan or five-door wagon (Touring). The car used a shortened version of the Legacy&#x27;s floor pan. According to a &quot;Motor Trend&quot; article written March 1992 on page 26, the name of Subaru&#x27;s new compact was, initially, to be called the Loyale, displaying an official photograph of the four-door sedan. In late 1995, a two-door coupe was introduced. In Japan it was called Impreza Retna. Initial engine choices included 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0-liter naturally aspirated engines.

Subaru chose to continue their longstanding use of the boxer engine in the Impreza. According to Subaru, their configuration of the engine inline with the transmission minimizes body roll due to the lower center of gravity compared with offset engines in most other vehicles. The boxer design provides good vibration mitigation due to the principles of a balanced engine because the movement of each piston is largely countered by a piston in the opposing cylinder bank, eliminating the need for a counter-weighted rotating crankshaft (harmonic balancer), but with some vibration from offsets. Torque steer is also reduced with this type of powertrain layout since the front drive shafts are of equal length and weight.

At the time of introduction, the Japanese and European market naturally aspirated models (1.6 and 1.8) received an unusual grille with a small central opening. Only the WRX and regular North American models received a conventional &quot;full&quot; grille until the 1994 facelift, when the regular models&#x27; appearance was brought in line with that of the sporting models.

The Outback Sport was introduced to North America in 1994 for the 1995 model year as an updated Impreza &quot;L&quot; Sports Wagon. It was the top trim level of the Impreza wagon model with no significant mechanical or performance changes from the lower trim levels aside from a slightly lifted suspension. Subaru found some sales success with the Outback Sport as a smaller companion with similar ride height changes, body colors and trim levels to the larger, more successful selling Legacy-based Outback. For the first time, the 2.2-liter engine was used in the American Impreza. Later, the 2.5-liter engine was introduced. In Japan, the Impreza WRX Sports Wagon was offered with a similar approach to the Outback Sport, calling it the &quot;Impreza Gravel Express&quot;. Subaru discontinued the Gravel Express when the second generation Impreza was introduced due to very limited sales. The hood-scoop found on the American Outback Sport was non-functional but was probably included because the American and Japanese versions were built at the same factory in Japan. The Outback Sport was offered with optional equipment, such as a gauge pack installed on top of the dashboard, that included a digital compass, outside temperature and barometer or altimeter readings.

Trim levels were LX, GL and Sport generation. LX models were front-wheel drive, and powered by a 1.6-liter engine. GL trim levels were either front-wheel drive (Subaru badged these 2WD) or all-wheel-drive (badged AWD); cars launched in 1993 had a choice of 1.6- and 1.8-liter flat-4 engines, the 1.6 being available with 2WD, the 1.8 an AWD version only. From 1996, the 1.8-liter versions were dropped (in the European market), and replaced by a 2.0-liter engine. Sport versions had alloy wheels, and a 2.0-liter engine only.

During this generation, Subaru offered a limited edition Impreza Sports Wagon called the Casa Blanca, which had a retro-inspired front and rear end treatment, which was inspired by the popular kei car Subaru Vivio Bistro styling package and Subaru Sambar Dias Classic. However, the styling was controversial and the sales were very low. Even though the run was limited to 5,000 units and it was considered a rare find, depreciation values were very low and was a very niche car.

The Impreza received an external facelift for the 1997 model year, followed by an interior redesign in 1998, using the new redesigned dashboard from the Forester.

Subaru of North America initially offered the Impreza with the 1.8-liter engine only, with either front- or all-wheel drive; a 2.2-liter engine became optional for 1995. For the 1995 model year, the 1.8/EJ18 was available with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission on the &#x27;base&#x27; model only. The 2.2/EJ22 was only available with an automatic transmission for the L, LX, and Outback Sport trims. The 1995 model year also introduced OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics version 2) in the EJ22/Automatic transmission equipped models. The 1996 model line-up replaced the base version with the low-content Brighton trim, also used in the Legacy model. A five-speed manual transmission became available with the 2.2 engine on all models, except the Brighton which was only available with the 1.8 and a 5-speed.

Subaru later decided to emphasize all-wheel drive in North America, making it standard on every Impreza (and Legacy) from 1997 onwards. North American markets never received the WRX version of the first generation Impreza. To test the waters for a full-fledged turbocharged model, Subaru showcased a turbocharged Impreza at various car shows around the country. The vehicle was named the 2.5RX and is now located in Subaru of America&#x27;s Cherry Hill, New Jersey storage facility. Subsequently, the 2.5RS performance model was introduced in 1998 (the same year the 1.8-liter engine was dropped). A naturally aspirated 2.5-liter engine and larger brakes were fitted into the coupe body with gold-colored 16-inch five-spoke alloy wheels. The 2.5RS also featured several external cues from its overseas brethren such as hood vents, a hood scoop, and a rally-inspired rear spoiler. The 2.5/EJ25D (DOHC) used in the 1998 RS suffered from a high-rate of head gasket failures. The 1999 model featured several changes: the newly designed &quot;Phase II&quot; SOHC version of the same 2.5-liter engine featured a slightly higher peak torque by , the wheels turned to a standard silver, the interior got an update, and the exterior became visually similar to the Japanese model with an updated front bumper borrowed from the Japanese Version 5 Impreza WRX STI. 2.5RS models became available in sedan form for 2000 along with the inclusion of viscous-type rear LSDs as standard equipment.

The G in GC/GM/GF corresponds to the production line (Impreza) while the following character is the chassis code. In the US and Canada, C denotes a sedan, M a coupe and F a wagon. Note that this is not the case for the RHD vehicles. In the case of the 2.5RS, the VIN would be either GC6 (2000 - 2001) or GM6 (1999-2001), with the 6 corresponding to the N/A SOHC EJ253 engine, specifically the engine displacement of 2.5 liters. The 1998 RS came with an N/A DOHC EJ25D.

===WRX and STi===

There have been seven noted versions of the WRX dating back from Subaru&#x27;s original World Rally Cross staging vehicles. Subaru adopted the name &quot;WRX&quot; to stand for &quot;World Rally eXperimental&quot; as all WRX versions (1992 to present) feature rally inspired technology, including all wheel drive, stiffened suspensions and turbocharged four cylinder engines. The STi versions were the high performance models, homologated for rallying and are labeled as versions 1 through to 6. These come in three different body styles; saloon, Coupé (type R only) and estate.

Subaru introduced Subaru Tecnica International (STi) versions of the WRX in Japan starting in 1992 although the first model badged as an STI was the Version 1 in late 1993 (see below). These models were upgraded from the standard WRX in many categories, including blueprinted performance-tuned engines, transmissions, and suspensions. The STi versions of the WRX were immensely successful in rallies and popular among street racers but were only sold in the Japanese market. Compared to the WRX, the STi had mostly mechanical modifications. STi prepped Subaru rally cars since 1988 including the Legacy RS, the WRX STi Version I was just the first car badged as an STi. Model variants are known as Versions 1-6, or by Roman numeric terms. 

;GC8A (11/1992-9/1993)
The WRX debuted in November 1992 with . The center differential was a viscous coupling type, the rear limited slip differential was a viscous type. The WRX Type RA is a stripped-down version of the WRX that was available in the Japanese market for people to purchase for motorsports. Targeted for race and rally, the RA versions were generally lighter in weight; featuring reduced soundproofing, manual windows, car horn delete, no air conditioning, no anti-lock brakes, and added racing features such as more robust engines, fifth injection, intercooler water spray and shorter gearing. The WRX Type RA uses a closer ratio gearbox and a three-spoke leather steering wheel from Nardi.

In Europe, the WRX was introduced as the Impreza GT, and as the Impreza Turbo 2000 (UK). It came with .

;GC8B (10/1993-8/1994) - Version I
In October 1993, Subaru introduced the 1994 model year WRX which produced . The rear rotors were substituted from ventilated disk to solid disk. October 1993 was also the start of production of the wagon version, with . As this was the first STi-badged Impreza, this is typically referred to as the version 1.

The first STi was known simply as &quot;WRX STi version&quot; and 100 per month were produced starting from February 1994. These cars were taken from the factory assembly line and modified at STi with the required parts. It had .

A lightweight version called the Type RA was also offered, again with many amenities deleted to reduce weight and cost. Producing , this version of the WRX STi came with a Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD). This device was an electromechanical differential that could lock the differential. Intercooler water spray was also fitted for the RA model. 

;GC8C (9/1994-9/1996) - Version II

In November 1994, the WRX had a power increase to . The wheel diameters were increased to and brake rotors were both changed to ventilated disks. In Japan, there was a Version of the WRX Sports Wagon with Outback trim, a bull bar and tailgate mounted spare wheel called the &quot;Impreza Gravel Express&quot;. 

To commemorate Colin McRae&#x27;s success in the international rally scene, Subaru in the UK released 200 limited edition &quot;Series McRae&quot; Turbo 2000&#x27;s in June 1995, prepared by Prodrive. These vehicles were finished in a very limited &quot;Rally Blue&quot; color scheme, sported gold 16-inch alloy wheels, McRae decals, individual numbered badging from 1–201 (car 13 was never built since the number 13 is considered unlucky), and a factory-fitted electric tilt/slide sunroof. Recaro seats were fitted in the front, and the rear seats and side panels were retrimmed in the same Le Mans/Avus material.

The regular STi&#x27;s engine output stood at . The car weighed and had gold wheels like those on the World Rally Championship Impreza. Now, the STi was built alongside the WRX on the production line rather than being sent to STi.
The 1996 model year WRX debuted in January 1996. The WRX design received minimal mechanical changes, but a WRX V-Limited Edition was introduced to celebrate the success of the Impreza WRC car in the FIA WRC. It was mechanically the same to the WRX but had a curb weight nudge to . The V-limited cars are painted in World Rally Blue. A WRX STi Version II V-Limited edition was also produced. The interior is colored blue on the seat inserts and carpeting. The WRX Type RA STi Version II received a radio and air-conditioning in the V-limited form. 1,000 WRX STi Version II V-limited were produced, with 555 WRX Type RA STi Version II V-limited models produced.

;GC8D (9/1996-9/1997) - Version III
In September 1996, the WRX was updated with new styling. The WRX now has a power rating of and now weighed . Although it actually developed about 300 horsepower, the output was under-reported at the then-established gentlemen&#x27;s agreement power limit of 280 PS.

Subaru in the UK released the Turbo 2000 &quot;Catalunya&quot; in March 1997, a limited production of 200 cars (again excluding car number 13) in black with red flecks riding on gold alloy wheels. The Catalunya was made to celebrate winning Subaru&#x27;s second WRC manufacturer&#x27;s title at the Rally of Spain (Catalunya).

With GC8D came the start of the coupé version of the WRX. It is called the WRX Type R. The coupe was chosen by Prodrive for use in the WRC because it was lighter and stiffer than the sedan, although it carried the same exterior dimensions. It was essentially a two-door version of the WRX Type RA meaning it had DCCD, minimal sound insulation, close-gear ratios and hardened gearbox. This car also has a water-spray nozzle to dampen the top of the intercooler. The water will then evaporate, taking heat away from the intercooler and cooling the intake charge. This car was produced on an order-only basis. An estimated 10,000 Type R models were produced for the Japanese Domestic Market. Also, there was a WRX Type RA (sedan) available, with a roof vent instead of map lights, and wind up windows, although electrics are an option from factory.

Also available was a WRX Type R V-limited. It has a WRX motor with no forged internals like the STI, and it misses out on the four-pot front brakes as they are to be installed by rally teams. It has a roof vent and is lightweight, making a good base for a rally car.

;GC8E (September 1997 to August 1998) - Version IV
In Europe, the Subaru Impreza GT&#x27;s (Turbo 2000 in UK) interior was updated to leather. For the STi, power remained at 280 PS. Forged pistons were also added. The interior and the cockpit were changed into a newer design along with the new white colored gauges. (&lt;- leather was an option and there was no such thing as an EU spec STi.)

For the UK, the Turbo 2000 &quot;Terzo&quot; was released in April 1998. 333 cars in blue with gold alloy wheels were produced to celebrate Subaru&#x27;s WRC title.
In 1998, Subaru of Japan produced a widebody, coupe WRX STi called the &quot;22B STi&quot; produced between March and August 1998. The 22B was used to commemorate both Subaru&#x27;s 40th anniversary as well as the third consecutive manufacturer&#x27;s title for Subaru in the FIA World Rally Championship. On the release of the sales, all 400 Japanese units sold out in from 30 minutes to 48 hours, depending on the report. Another 24 were produced for export markets—16 for the UK, along with another 5 for Australia, and 3 prototypes. The 16 cars imported to the UK were modified by Prodrive, with longer gear ratios, and UK specification lights. Because 50 22Bs had already been imported privately into the UK, Subaru had to wait until 1999 to register the 16 officially imported cars under the VCA&#x27;s Single Vehicle Approval scheme. It performed incredibly well in the snow, as the unique four-wheel-drive and quick clutch allowed for easy control.

The 22B had the &quot;EJ22G engine&quot; (note, the internal Subaru material states the closed-deck block comes from a version III &quot;EJ20G&quot;). This means the displacement was increased from to , bored up to . Officially, it produced at 6,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm of torque, fuel feed by Electronic Fuel Injection and an IHI RHF 5HB turbocharger. This car was given a unique color of blue and had fender flared widebody taken from the Peter Stevens designed WRC car, thus widening the width by 80 mm (3.15 inches). The car has a unique hood, front and rear fenders, a WRC-inspired front bumper and a unique adjustable rear wing. During assembly, a WRX Type R chassis was taken off the line. The fenders were replaced with the 22B STi fenders. The suspension is provided by Bilstein, while the brakes were four-pot front/two-pot rear STi calipers, painted red. The wheels were increased in size from the standard WRX Type R STI Version from 16- to 17-inches and the clutch was upgraded to a sintered twin clutch with a ceramic disk. The origin of the name 22B has been debated. The 22 referred to the 2.2-liter displacement and the B was thought to be for the Bilstein suspension. This would correlate with the idea that Subaru sells a Legacy Spec B, where the B represents the Bilstein suspension. However, the B is actually a Subaru internal code for Turbo. 22B is also hexadecimal for the number 555, in reference to State Express 555, Subaru&#x27;s major sponsor in the WRC from 1993 to 2004. The car&#x27;s curb weight is .

;GC8F (9/1998-9/1999) - Version V
Mechanically the GC8F was virtually the same as its predecessor. The torque was increased a little from at 4000 rpm. The weight also continues to increase and is set at .

To celebrate the return of British driver Richard Burns to the rally team, a limited edition of 444 Turbo 2000 &quot;RB5&quot; models in gray were created in 1999 for the UK. The basic model had little more than cosmetic differences, but most had the WR Sport Performance Pack, an option consisting of a new ECU and exhaust for and torque. There was also an optional Prodrive suspension pack.

The standard UK Impreza Turbo 2000 was also tuned and partly restyled by Prodrive in 1999 to create the &quot;Prodrive WR Sport&quot;. It featured a unique interior, suspension upgrade, new bodykit and wheels, plus WR Sport decals and an optional ECU upgrade.

For the STI, the power stayed the same as the previous version but the engine layout and design was made cleaner and was dubbed as the &quot;Boxer Phase 2&quot; engine. The facelift the rest of the Impreza line had was also applied to the STI. The WRX STI weighed . There were 1000 WRX Type RA STI Version 5 Limited cars and each had a four-month waiting period. The interior was also changed slightly, including seats and steering. This model was also produced as a 555 limited edition.

;GC8G (9/1999-9/2000) - Version VI
The last version of the GC WRX was introduced in September 1999. There is no change in the mechanical specifications. Added features are newly designed alloy wheels, color-coded mirrors and door handles, remote central locking, intermittent wipers with a timer and map lights.

The European GT model received further upgrades in the form of more parts from the STI range. The front brakes became Subaru branded four-pot calipers with discs, the wheels having become 16-inch lightweight alloys. The STI 4 high-level wing was fitted to the sedan, and STI-style front bucket seats and firmer suspension were also fitted. The &quot;Phase 2&quot; engine now fitted developed , an increase of over the previous model.

To counter the grey imports of high-performance Japanese variants, Subaru UK commissioned Prodrive to produce a limited edition of 1,000 two-door cars in Sonic Blue, called the WRX &quot;P1&quot;. Released in March 2000, they were taken from the STI Type R lines and used for the P1. The P1 and Australian Subaru delivered STI Version 5 were the only coupe versions of the WRX STI GC chassis to receive ABS. In order to allow for ABS, the DCCD was dropped. Engine output was boosted to , and the suspension optimised for British roads. Options were available from Subaru consisting of four-piston front brake calipers, electric Recaro seats, 18-inch wheels and a P1 stamped backbox. The P1, or Prodrive One, is echoed in the name of the Prodrive P2 concept car.

Likewise, for the STI, most of the changes were cosmetic with the fender being sculpted to be more aggressive. There were 2,000 WRX STI Version 6 Limited model produced, plus 1000 of the WRX STI Type R coupe Version 6 Limited, 2,000 of the WRX STI RA Version 6 Limited, and also 500 of the WRX STI Version 6 Limited hatchback models.

In 2000, STI released the WRX STI &quot;S201&quot;, of which 300 were produced. This series is a limited production series that sports an engine output of at 6500 rpm and at 4000 rpm as special variants were excluded from the gentlemen&#x27;s agreement. The car was decked with nearly every single part from the STI catalogue. The S201 was a sedan that sported the only body-kitted S-series WRX STI. Weighing in at , the S201 had a tri-planar wing and a massive front air splitter. The entire suspension was composed of STI parts.

== Second generation (GD, GG; 2000) ==
Subaru introduced the &quot;New Age&quot; Impreza to Japan in August 2000. Larger in size compared to the previous iteration, the sedan increased its width by , while the wagon notably increased by just —placing the two variants in different Japanese classification categories. The coupe body style from the first generation did not reappear for the new series, and the off-road appearance package that included contrasting-colored bumpers did carry over forward. Marketed as a separate model line, this North America-only variant was, as before, badged the Outback Sport.

Naturally aspirated flat-four (boxer) engines comprised the 1.5-liter &quot;EJ15&quot;, the 1.6-liter &quot;EJ16&quot;, the 2.0-liter &quot;EJ20&quot;, and the 2.5-liter &quot;EJ25&quot;. Turbocharged versions of the 2.0- and 2.5-liter engines were offered in the WRX and WRX STI models. STI models featured a more powerful 2.0-liter (2.5-liter outside of the Japanese market) turbocharged engine. WRX models featured a 2.0-liter turbocharged boxer engine until 2005, after which they switched to the 2.5-liter turbocharged engine.

At the Australian Wheels Car of the Year, the car won the overall COTY award in 2000. At the American MotorWeek Drivers&#x27; Choice Awards, the Impreza won the Best Sport Sedan in 2002 and the Best Performance Car in 2004.

=== First facelift (&quot;Blobeye&quot;) ===
=== Second facelift (&quot;Hawkeye&quot;) ===
===Saab 9-2X===
Subaru manufactured a badge engineered variant, marketed by Saab as the 9-2X for the North American market (2004-2006) in solely the wagon bodystyle. The 9-2X received redesigned front and rear styling as well as other interior, acoustic and technical modifications. This badge-engineered model has been colloquially referred to as a &quot;Saabaru&quot; among enthusiasts. See the Impreza WRX Second Generation for more info here.

===WRX ===
As with the first generation, the turbocharged WRX and the WRX STI variants were available in numerous specifications with various limited edition models sold, with the STI models being more performance focused. Subaru issued yearly updates to the STI, tweaking cosmetics and equipment levels, and also improving performance and handling.

=== WRX STI ===
;S202

The S202, produced in 2002, was based on the WRX STI type RA spec C; STI fitted an upgraded intake and exhaust system to increase maximum engine output to at 6400 rpm and at 4400 rpm. Weight was slightly reduced to and production was limited to 400 units.

;S203
The S203, produced in 2004 and sporting the first restyled front end, was fitted with a larger turbo to increase maximum engine output. Subaru Team driver Petter Solberg helped to develop the S203. Compared to the S202, power remained unchanged at at 6400 rpm, but torque increased to at 4400 rpm. Weight also increased to and production was limited to 555 units.

;WRX STI S20-SC

The WRX STI S20-SC (Speed Shift 2.0 Litre S-Car) is a Limited Edition classified S-Car sold only in Subaru Docklands, Melbourne, Australia. As most S-Cars were sold to the Japanese Domestic Market the S20 SC was limited in production to just 10 cars for Australia. The S20 SC was offered only in (51E) white and included all available WRX STI Version 8 extras, modifications to performance and additional cosmetic changes.

Subaru Australia utilised the 10 vehicles to showcase the catalogue options available to the standard STI. These included but not limited to; STI sway bars, fog lamp “delete” for further weight reduction, STI headlight covers, optional additional cosmetic STI badging etc. all of which came standard to the S20 SC. Additional to the catalogue promoted STI parts, the S20 SC exclusive modifications include; STI struts, lowered springs, a short shifter mechanism with exclusive gear knob, STI braided brake lines, black wheels, unique interior (B20) blue/black, various external badging, ECU tweaks and a build number plaque stating the build number.

;S204
The S204, produced in 2005 with the second restyling, also was fitted with a larger turbo to increase maximum engine output and the engine was hand-assembled. Compared to the S202 and S203, power remained unchanged at at 6400 rpm, but torque increased to at 4400 rpm. Weight also increased to and production was limited to 600 units.

;Spec C Type RA-R
The Spec C Type RA-R was derived from the S204 with additional measures to lighten the car. The same engine and output were fitted, but weight was reduced to . Of the 300 cars produced, a sub-edition of 50 was limited to the Astral Yellow color.

== Third generation (GE, GH, GR, GV; 2007) ==

Subaru revealed the third generation Impreza at the New York Auto Show on 2 April 2007—both the standard naturally aspirated Impreza and turbocharged WRX versions were revealed. The third generation of the high performance WRX STI debuted in October 2007. This generation also saw the discontinuation of the wagon, replaced by a new 5-door hatchback body style. The wide-body variants of the hatchback and sedan are internally labelled &quot;GR&quot; and &quot;GV&quot;, respectively. Dimensionally, this version is wider by and increases track by approximately to (F/R). Although first adopted by the STI, the wide-body platform was later utilized by the standard WRX range.

The third series of the Impreza is slightly longer, wider and offers a longer wheelbase. Two Subaru traditions were discontinued with the new model: the parking light switch atop the steering column is no longer present, and for the first time the windows have frames to improve noise, vibration, and harshness levels. Subaru made an effort to control the weight of the new chassis. Despite the increase in size, stiffness, and safety equipment, the car&#x27;s weight is similar to the previous generation. The front suspension uses a MacPherson strut setup, while the rear features a new double wishbone suspension.

Flat-four gasoline engines in the naturally aspirated tune comprised a 1.5-liter &quot;EL15&quot; producing , the 2.0-liter &quot;EJ20&quot; with and , and the 2.5-liter &quot;EJ25&quot; with . Turbocharged versions of the two latter engines were fitted to the WRX and WRX STI versions as discussed later. Subaru introduced a flat-four diesel engine, designated &quot;EE20&quot; at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. Sales began in several European countries from early 2009, with the 2.0-liter turbo diesel engine of . Two models are available as of July 2009, 2.0 TD and 2.0 TD Sport.

In the Japanese domestic market the range comprised the 1.5-liter 15S, plus the 2.0-liter 20S and turbocharged S-GT, both using the 2.0-liter engine. Japanese dealers retailed the hatchback initially, with the sedan body variant arriving in autumn 2008 as the Impreza Anesis. This generation represented the first time that the Impreza was no longer in compliance with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions. Japanese specification models are fitted with an engine start button.

Subaru Australia released the third generation hatchback in September 2007. Naturally aspirated 2.0-liter versions fell under the R, RX and RS trims, with the turbocharged 2.5-liter reserved for the WRX. The sedan body style came later in 2008, paralleling the hatchbacks&#x27;s model range.

North America received only the 2.5-liter models. Released to the United States market for the 2008 model year, the model range consists of the 2.5i, the turbocharged WRX, and the Outback Sport that Subaru marketed as a separate model line. The naturally aspirated models are electronically limited from surpassing . For 2009, a new 2.5i GT trim arrived to the market with the turbocharged engine from the 2008 model WRX (this 2009 WRX received a boost in power). While automatic transmission was not available with the WRX, the 2.5i GT did gain an optional four-speed automatic. In the Canadian market, the base Impreza 2.5i received upgrades for the 2009 model year, including rear disc brakes, electronic stability control, and body-colored door handles—features previously only found on the 2.5i Sport and more expensive trims.

In Israel, the Impreza is denoted as the B3, and three styles are offered: the B3 1.5, with a 1.5-liter engine, the B3 2.0 and the B3 2.0 Sport, both with the 2.0-liter engine. Four-door and five-door models are available for each engine type, ranging from the basic R class, to the medium RX and top RXI class.

Indonesian-specification versions were initially only available as the hatchback style, with the sedan arriving in 2011. The 1.5 R and 2.0 R could be ordered with a dual-range five-speed manual, or four-speed automatic transmission. However, in Singapore and Thailand, the Impreza 1.5 R, 2.0 R, and 2.5 WRX are also offered as four-door sedan. The WRX STI trim in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines can be ordered with the dual-range six-speed manual, or five-speed automatic if the WRX STI A-Line is available.

Safety of the car has been increased with range wide inclusion of electronic stability control as standard in many markets. When the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in the US crash-tested the five-door Impreza, the organization granted the Impreza the highest ranking available. ANCAP in Australia tested the Impreza where it scored 34.66 out of 37 points, or the full five-star rating in the occupant safety crash test; the Impreza also scored a four-star pedestrian safety test.

The Impreza range received a facelift in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, gaining a new grille insert.

===WRX===
Subaru debuted the turbocharged WRX performance variant of the third generation series alongside the mainstream naturally aspirated models on 2 April 2007. For this generation, most markets adopted the abbreviated name &quot;WRX&quot;, although the Japanese, North American and UK markets retained the full &quot;Subaru Impreza WRX&quot; title. The 2.5-liter &quot;EJ255&quot; engine is largely unchanged internally. The main change is the airflow efficiency of the heads. Changes in the engine compartment consist primarily of a fourth generation Legacy GT style intake manifold and intercooler. The TD04 turbo remains from the previous generation, however it has been adjusted to fit the new intake design. Power output consists of and from its 2.5-liter engine. It was offered in either a five-speed manual, or 4 speed automatic. The five-speed manual transmission was changed to the same found in the fourth-generation Legacy GT. The rear limited slip differential has been discarded in exchange for the new VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) system. The weight of the car also has been reduced and gives the WRX a time of 5.8 seconds. In contrast, curb weight of the standard Impreza model is around heavier. For the US market, the WRX was offered in &quot;base&quot;, Premium, and Limited trim levels. In Australia, the WRX is available as a sedan or hatchback. An optional premium package adds the satellite navigation with DVD player and 7-inch screen, leather upholstery and a sunroof.

In response to criticism that the third generation WRX suspension is too soft, and needing to keep on par with rival car companies new releases, Subaru issued several changes in 2008 for the 2009 model year, known in the UK as the WRX-S. The &quot;EJ255&quot; engine received an output boost to and of torque by swapping the previous &quot;TD04&quot; turbocharger to an IHI &quot;VF52&quot;. This led to the car now achieving a 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time of 4.7 seconds, as tested by &quot;Car and Driver&quot;. In addition, the updated model received altered springs/struts, sway bars, and Dunlop summer tires to improve handling. Exterior cosmetic changes included the 2008 WRX Premium aero package, STi spoiler (Hatchback only), updated grill with WRX badge, and darker Gunmetal colored wheels as standard equipment. Interior changes consisted of aluminum pedals, silver trim around the shifter, red stitching on the shift boot and seats, and a red WRX logo embroidered on the driver and passenger seat.

Further changes in 2010 (for the 2011 model year) saw the WRX gain the wide-body shell from the STI, as well as the addition of quad muffler tips with diffuser. The new model gains . Firmer rear sub-frame bushings and wider 17-inch wheels contribute to improved traction.

=== WRX STI===
Debuting at the Tokyo Auto Show in October 2007, WRX STI versions build further on the standard WRX cars. The STI available in Japan is fitted with the 2.0-liter &quot;EJ207&quot; engine with twin scroll turbocharger generating at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm. Export markets receive the higher-displacement 2.5-liter &quot;EJ257&quot; unit with the single-scroll &quot;VF48&quot; turbocharger rated at and of torque. The turbocharger directs air through a larger top-mount intercooler which has lost the red &quot;STI&quot; that was on previous generations. The STI (3,395 lbs) is heavier than the WRX (3,174- 3,240 lbs depending on trim) due to a more robust transmission, rear differential and other chassis reinforcements.

Like the standard WRX, the third generation model was shortened to &quot;Subaru WRX STI&quot;, with the Japanese markets notably abstaining from this convention. To differentiate the STI from the regular WRX, Subaru opted to manufacture the STI with a wider body and therefore track—as noted by the flared wheel arches. Furthermore, Subaru utilized aluminum suspension components for the STI. Electronic modifications include a multi-mode electronic stability control with &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;traction&quot;, and &quot;off&quot; modes; Subaru Intelligent-Drive (SI-Drive) with three modes: &quot;intelligent&quot;, &quot;sport&quot;, and &quot;sport sharp&quot;; and multi-mode driver controlled center differential (DCCD). The DCCD is a combined mechanical and solenoid operated limited-slip differential which enables the driver to switch between manual and automated center differential locking. The locking strength can vary from fully open to fully locked with a 41/59 front/rear open torque bias.

The STI hatchback was released in the United States in March 2008.

A Subaru Impreza WRX STI Group R4 was entered in the 2012 FIA Asia-Pacific Rally.

In 2010 for the 2011 model year, the WRX STI became available as a four-door. The most noticeable feature on the STI sedan is a large rear spoiler. Australia also received the 2011 model year STI as a sedan to complement the hatchback released in 2008. Australian STIs were offered in standard form, plus the STI spec.R. An electric sunroof, leather upholstery, satellite navigation, and BBS wheels are standard on the spec.R, while Recaro seats are optional.

A facelift of the STI arrived in 2010 for the 2011 model year, distinguished by a new front bumper. Tweaks to the suspension—stiffer springs, larger anti-roll bars, new pillow ball bushings on the front lower arms, as well as wider standard tires—had the effect of improved handling.

As the name implies, focus was given to the car&#x27;s performance on public roads in its development in order to create the best road-going car possible. As for the engine, maximum output was increased to at 6400 rpm and the maximum torque to at 4400 rpm by the introduction of such components as a special ball bearing twin scroll turbo. In addition, Brembo 13-inch discs and calipers were installed on the front and rear brakes. With regard to the exterior, aerodynamic devices including STI front and rear under spoilers were fitted. In order to further enhance the &quot;flexible yet elegant driving feel&quot; that STI aims for, a newly developed Flexible Draw Stiffener was installed along with STI dampers/springs and Flexible Tower Bar.

== Fourth generation (GJ, GP; 2011) ==

Four-door sedan or five-door hatchback versions of the fourth-generation Impreza were unveiled in 2011 at the New York International Auto Show. The car went on sale in late 2011 as a 2012 model year. There is also a bigger station wagon with different bodywork, called the Subaru Levorg. It was first shown at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show and went on sale in April 2014.

Early US models include a choice of a 2.0-liter DOHC (148 hp) engine, five-speed manual or &quot;Lineartronic&quot; CVT with paddle shifting six-speed manual mode. Trim package included base 2.0i, 2.0i Premium, and 2.0i Limited.

Japan models went on sale on 20 December 2011. a choice of four-door sedan (as Impreza G4) or five-door hatchback body (as Impreza Sport), 1.6-liter DOHC FB16 (1.6i, 1.6i-L) or 2.0-liter DOHC FB20 (2.0i, 2.0i EyeSight, 2.0i-S, 2.0i-S EyeSight), five-speed manual or &quot;Lineartronic&quot; continuously variable transmission (CVT). The smaller 1.6-liter engine is offered in Japan so as to reduce the annual Japanese road tax obligation.

Remaining nearly the same size as the previous series, the new model is lighter and more fuel efficient, plus is claimed to be better packaged. The 2012 Impreza received longer wheelbase that provides more interior room for passengers. The Impreza hatchback rear head-and-legroom is impressive; two adults can ride in the back of the Impreza with comfort. Whereas, in the hatchback, the rear 65/35 split seatbacks fold down, offering 52.4 cu. ft. of cargo space.

Higher quality materials are fitted throughout the interior, and due to its larger exterior dimensions as defined by Japanese government regulations, the Impreza is an upmarket product in Japan. It is now almost exactly the same dimensions as the first and second Subaru Legacy (1990–1999). The 2015–2016 models had an updated grille, bumper, side mirrors and increased sound deadening.

The third generation high-performance WRX variants continued in production until new versions were released in early 2014. In 2014, Subaru decided to move away from marketing the WRX and WRX STI under the Impreza name. The WRX and WRX STI are performance trims of the Impreza with higher output engines, firmer suspension, larger brakes, slightly resculpted body panels, lowered ride height and larger intakes. Subaru had promised to completely move the WRX and STi off the Impreza chassis and body to create a standalone model, but they instead chose to simply alter the Impreza&#x27;s body, and chassis and remove the Impreza name. Subaru decided to not produce a WRX or WRX STi wagon as had been previously offered. The wagon made up approximately 50 percent of US WRX and WRX STI sales.

In addition to the regular models, Subaru also offered the Impreza Sport Hatchback in the Premium and Limited trim levels. The so-called American Impreza Sport (not to be confused with the JDM regular hatchback with the same name) has the rugged style with side spoilers, roof rack, different style alloys, and availability of two-tone colors. However it also has the normal ground clearance, unlike the new XV. For the Premium model grade, buyers can choose 5 speed manual or Lineartronic CVT, while the Limited is only available with CVT.

EyeSight consists of two cameras with one on each side of the interior rear view mirror, that use human like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. Autonomous cruise control system has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid. This feature is initially available only in Japan, but was expanded to US models of other vehicles, beginning with 2013 Legacy and Outback models.

In 2013, the Impreza won the IIHS Top Safety Pick+ award. In 2014, the car won the National Business Review Sports Car of the year award in New Zealand.

===Subaru XV/Crosstrek===
Like its predecessor, the fourth generation Impreza was also available with a crossover-styled model. However, instead of the third generation where it was badged as the Impreza XV or the Outback Sport, it was now called the Subaru XV. In North America, it was named the Subaru XV Crosstrek until 2015 when it was changed to Subaru Crosstrek. In Japan, it continued to be called the Subaru Impreza XV. This model debuted at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. It went on sale in Japan in September 2012 and in the United States during the 2012 New York International Auto Show. It made its Southeast Asian debut at the 2012 Indonesia International Motor Show.

=== Subaru WRX (VA)===
For the VA series WRX released in 2014 for the 2015 model year, Subaru took a different approach with the model when compared to past generations. This time, the Impreza name was dropped in all markets in which the new model was named simply the WRX, as had been the case in North America with the previous model, while in Japan it was sold as the WRX S4. The body design also took a stronger departure from the Impreza donor model than in the past. The general WRX profile/silhouette was carried over from the Impreza, as were the front doors, trunk lid, and interior. However, the entire front end bodywork plus the rear quarter panels were unique to the WRX. The rear doors received a subtle reskin with an upwards kink and revised character line, but retained an otherwise identical shape.

=== Safety ===
== Fifth generation (GK, GT; 2016) ==

Subaru unveiled the fifth generation 2017 model year Impreza sedan and hatchback at the New York International Auto Show in March 2016. The fifth generation is the first model based on the new Subaru Global Platform, which would be the base for all future Subaru models.

Japanese domestic market models went on sale on 13 October 2016 at Subaru dealerships, while the new Impreza entered the core North American and Australian markets for the company in December 2016. In Japan, the new Impreza outsold its monthly sales target of 2,500 units by more than fourfold, with 11,050 orders. According to Subaru, demand from customers in the Japanese domestic market switching from other brands was notable, representing 51% of all orders, indicating that the Impreza was attracting a wider range of customers there. North American models were produced for the first time at Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. in Lafayette, Indiana, while the Crosstrek continues to be produced in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIA Impreza production 11/2016 fhi.co.jp&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Models for markets outside of North America continue to be produced in Japan. SIA also produces the North American-market Subaru Outback and Subaru Legacy, and also produced the three-row Ascent crossover previewed by the Viziv 7 concept from the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show in 2018.

The new Subaru Global Platform underpins both sedan and hatch versions of the Impreza. This new platform has an increased rigidity of 70% to 100% over the outgoing model and a lower center of gravity by 5 mm (0.2 inches). 95% of this new Impreza is all-new compared to the fourth generation. The suspension has been set up for better comfort, while Active Torque Vectoring in some models improves dynamics. The car is longer and wider than the old one, with a longer wheelbase. Much of the increase in wheelbase was used to improve front and rear-seat legroom; in the United States, Subaru now boasts that the new Impreza has category-leading passenger room.

Powering the new Subaru Impreza is a revised version of the FB20 2.0 litre direct-injection boxer-four. This engine is sold in all markets except Europe, where it came available in its hybrid variant (&quot;e-Boxer&quot;) in March 2020. A 1.6 litre engine continued to be available in Europe and in the Japanese domestic market. With around 80% of parts revamped, the engine produces in North American specs, four more than before. Subaru&#x27;s Lineartronic CVT was also improved with enhanced ratio coverage, and a 5-speed manual transmission continues to be available. The changes made to the Impreza&#x27;s 2.0L engine are supposed to offer slightly improved acceleration and flexibility of power delivery. Although the engine has 152 hp, some auto reviewers felt that the new Impreza continued to fall short in power when compared to competitors from other brands. Some competing compact sedans such as the Volkswagen Jetta, Honda Civic, and Hyundai Elantra were sold with optional engines offering 200 hp or more. Subaru rated the new Impreza in the US market (with 2.0L engine) an EPA-estimated city / highway. As with the previous generation Impreza, Subaru&#x27;s Symmetrical AWD was standard in all markets except Japan, where it was optional.

Subaru&#x27;s EyeSight suite of active safety functions was available, as was a new infotainment system with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In the North American and Australian market models, CarPlay and Android Auto were standard on all trims. The North American model Impreza Limited was also offered with a power driver&#x27;s seat for the first time in the model&#x27;s history. Although not present in the North American model, the new Impreza was also the first car ever produced by a Japanese brand to include a pedestrian protection airbag as standard. The new Impreza earned a record high safety score under the Japan New Car Assessment Program and earned top safety marks from the Euro NCAP in 2017.

At the car&#x27;s introduction in 2016, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award. This win gave Subaru only its second ever COTY trophy and its first victory since the Legacy B4 won 13 years ago.

===Subaru XV/Crosstrek===
The new Subaru XV (or Crosstrek for the North American market) was unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show in March 2017. Like the Impreza, the XV/Crosstrek has moved to the Subaru Global Platform. Minimum ground clearance is and like its predecessor, matte black cladding has been added to each side to add a &quot;rugged flavor&quot;, creating &quot;a dynamic form expressing all the enjoyment to be expected from a crossover vehicle&quot;.

=== Subaru WRX (2022)===

The second-generation standalone WRX model was unveiled in September 2021.

== Sixth generation (GU; 2023)==
The sixth generation Impreza was revealed on November 17, 2022 at the 2022 LA Auto Show being based on the outgoing model. It went on sale in the United States in Spring 2023 as a 2024 model year vehicle.

The sedan was discontinued, along with the manual transmission, leaving the hatchback and the Lineartronic CVT as the only options. Torsional rigidity is improved by ten percent by using more high-strength steel. The Impreza became more upmarket with standard Subaru EyeSight and automatic emergency braking. The dual-pinion steering rack from the WRX was also added. For the first time since it was discontinued in 2005, Subaru revived the 2.5 RS model, equipping it with a 2.5-liter FB25D engine which develops and of torque. The Base and Sport models use the 2.0-liter FB20D engine carried over from the prior generation, which makes and of torque.

=== Subaru Crosstrek ===

The fourth generation Subaru Crosstrek was revealed in Japan on September 15, 2022. It debuted in North America at the Chicago Auto Show on February 9, 2023.

==Police use==

Across its years of production, the Subaru Impreza has found use worldwide as a police car by numerous law enforcement agencies, most employing the Impreza WRX for high-speed traffic police and highway patrol duties in both marked and unmarked configurations. 

Various models of the Impreza have been used by prefectural police in Japan; Estonia, where 18 Impreza GX were purchased for the Estonian Police in 2003; Latvia, where six unmarked Impreza WRX were acquired for traffic policing use primarily on the outskirts and highways of the capital Riga; Australia, where in 1998, four unmarked Imprezas were first rolled out to Victoria Police, followed by a combination of marked and unmarked Imprezas entering service with the New South Wales Police Force and the Queensland Police Service that same year; France, where 73 Impreza WRXs entered service with the National Gendarmerie&#x27;s Rapid Intervention Brigades, replacing Peugeot 306 S16s, for use across the French motorway network in March 2006; and Singapore, where eight entered service with the Singapore Police Force in 2006. 

In the United Kingdom, marked and unmarked Imprezas were operated by Humberside Police, the first UK force to operate Imprezas with upgrades provided by Prodrive in 1998, North Yorkshire Police, the Hampshire Constabulary, Nottinghamshire Police, Essex Police, one of which was converted to a driving simulator following an accident damaging it beyond repair, and latterly, Greater Manchester Police and the Cumbria Constabulary. In the United States, the police department of the town of Itasca, Illinois uses a Subaru WRX STI for publicity purposes.

Greenfield, Wisconsin Police Department had a 2012 Subaru WRX STI for publicity and was also used as a patrol unit for 3 years. Mequon, Wisconsin Police Department has had 3 Subaru WRX&#x27;s (2015, 2017, 2020) over the years that have been changed out one after another for publicity and community outreach but could be used for police use.

==Motorsports==
The Impreza chassis has been more successful in rallying than Subaru&#x27;s previous contenders. Prior to the introduction of the Impreza into World Rally Championship racing in 1993, the Subaru World Rally Team had fielded its larger mid-size Legacy. However, with the rest of the rally competition increasingly shifting towards smaller and lighter chassis, Subaru introduced the smaller Impreza, immediately achieving a podium on its debut on the 1993 1000 Lakes Rally. To jumpstart its early rally efforts, and to develop the Impreza into a competitive rally car, Subaru teamed up with preparatory firm and British motorsports company Prodrive, in 1989.

Immediately following the first overall WRC event win for both the fledgling Subaru team and its young driver, the late Colin McRae aboard a Group A Legacy on the 1993 Rally New Zealand, the Scotsman&#x27;s teammate and childhood idol, 1981 World Rally Champion, Ari Vatanen of Finland, went on to finish second in the debut rally of the first ever factory Impreza. New recruit for the following season, 1990 and 1992 World Champion, Carlos Sainz brought the Impreza its inaugural victory on the 1994 Acropolis Rally.

The Impreza brought Subaru three consecutive WRC constructors&#x27; titles (1995–1997, the latter season the first for the newly introduced World Rally Car class) and a driver&#x27;s championship for McRae in 1995, the late Richard Burns in 2001, and the Norwegian, Petter Solberg in 2003.

Another evolution of the Impreza WRC made its debut in the 2007 Corona Rally Mexico. Unfortunately, the team had several major problems with reliability as the car experienced mechanical difficulties in almost every rally from its first.

Subaru debuted an Impreza WRC in hatchback form for the first time from the 2008 Acropolis Rally onwards, on which event Solberg scored a second-place finish. On 16 December 2008 Subaru announced that it would withdraw from the World Rally Championship due to economic problems. The Impreza holds the record for the most WRC event wins, tied with the Lancia Delta.

However, the Subaru Rally Team USA is still competing in the Rally America National Championship. Also, there are still several teams using Subaru models in the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. Starting in 2006, Subaru of America (SOA), as the official distributor of Subaru vehicles in the United States, participates in the Subaru Road Racing Team (SRRT) with a Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT Spec-B in the Grand-Am Street Tuner class. In 2010, SRRT campaigns a Subaru Impreza WRX STI in the Grand Sport class. In 2011, SRRT switched from the hatchback to a 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan.

Possum Bourne won the Silverstone Race to the Sky in 2001. David Higgins won the Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race in 2011 and 2014.
From 2005 to 2008, the Cusco team entered into the Super GT championship using an Impreza, being the only team to do so using a 4WD car.

Nobushige Kumakubo won the 2006 D1 Grand Prix season using a rear-wheel drive Impreza GDB. Stephan Verdier was Formula D&#x27;s Most Improved Driver of 2008, with Eric O&#x27;Sullivan winning Rookie of the Year in 2009.

Compass 360 Racing used an Impreza in the Canadian Touring Car Championship in 2010, with Roger Ledoux winning the title for Lachute Performance in 2014 and 2015. Other teams entering the GTS category of the 2014 Pirelli World Challenge season, the 1998 Japanese Touring Car Championship and the 2016 TCR International Series.

In April 2010, a modified third generation WRX STI driven by Tommi Mäkinen set a lap time of 7:55 on the Nürburgring Nordschleife, which is a record for a 4-door car. The Subaru Road Racing Team debuted the Impreza WRX STI hatchback and switched to Impreza WRX STI sedan in 2011 participated to the GRAND-AM Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge series.

In 2011, Mark Higgins used a stock Impreza to set a lap record at the Isle of Man TT course. In 2016, Higgins again broke the record in a modified WRX STI.

In May 2012, Subaru Rally Team USA announced that a new rallycross team, Subaru Puma Rallycross Team USA will participate in the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship season with Dave Mirra, Bucky Lasek, and Sverre Isachsen. They also competed in the 2014 FIA World Rallycross Championship.

The 2014 Alcan Winter Rally was won by a Subaru Impreza winning first in its class and taking first place in the overall race, continuing the winning tradition begun with the Legacy in 1990.

The car has also been used in endurance racing, having had class wins at the 2011 24 Hours of Nürburgring, the 1995 Eastern Creek 12 Hour, and the Bathurst 12 Hour in 1994 and 2007 and 2009. Hitoshi Goto won the 2017 Super Taikyu Series, finishing on the podium in every race.

The car won the Targa New Zealand three times, the Targa Newfoundland four times and the Targa Tasmania three times.

<doc id="527980" wikidata="Q211034" url="?curid=527980" title="Île Saint-Louis">
<text>Île Saint-Louis (), in size, is one of two natural islands in the Seine river, in Paris, France (the other natural island is the Île de la Cité, where Notre-Dame de Paris is located). Île Saint-Louis is connected to the rest of Paris by four bridges to both banks of the river and to the Île de la Cité by the Pont Saint-Louis.

The island is located within the 4th arrondissement of Paris and has a population of 4,453.

==History==
The island was first known as the Île Notre-Dame, and was used mostly for grazing cattle, fishing, drying laundry, and occasionally for fighting duels. In 1360 it was cut in half by a canal, at about the current Rue Poulettiere, in order to bring it into the protection of the new wall around the city built by King Charles V, The slightly smaller eastern portion was named the Ile des Vaches (Island of Cows) (not to be confused with another island of the same name farther downstream). That portion was used for storing wood and building boats.

It was originally owned by the chapter of Notre-Dame cathedral. The island was destined for real estate development under King Henry IV, but the king&#x27;s assassination in 1610 delayed the project. It was revived 1616 by the developers Christophe Marie, Poulettiere Le Regrettier. The canal dividing the island was filled, plots laid out and imposing residences built. The urbanisation of the island was rapid; within fifty years it was entirely occupied. The Pont Marie, which connects the island with the right bank, is named for Christophe Marie, one of the real estate developers of the island. Beginning in 1614, he was chief builder for Marie de&#x27; Medici, the widow of Henry IV and regent of the young King, Louis XIII. She instructed him to fill in the canal which divided the two parts of the island, and to build solid stone banks entirely around the island. The first part of the project was a new bridge, the Pont Louis XIII; the first stone was laid by the young king himself, then age 13. Various problems delayed the work on the bridge, which was not finished until 1635. The bridge has five arches, each of different sizes. Niches were built for statues between the arches, but, due to the difficulties of the regime, no statues were ever put in place.

Marie de&#x27; Medici promised a long series of benefits, including tennis courts and laundry boats for washing clothing and linen, to those who purchased lots and built houses on the island. She succeeded in attracting magistrates and financiers, but few aristocrats, who preferred the Marais quarter, which had larger plots of land and places for gardens. She also met resistance from the Chapter of Notre Dame, which owned considerable property on the island. Their resistance eventually drove the developer Christophe Marie into bankruptcy. In the end, the houses of the wealthy occupied waterside properties, while the interior was occupied by merchants and artisans.

The island did not take the name of Saint-Louis until 1725. Louis IX, who was made a saint only thirty years after his death in 1270, was believed to have sometimes held court and rendered justice on the island. 

During the French Revolution, the island was briefly renamed &quot;Ile de la Fraternité&quot;.

== Plan ==
==Description==
=== Quai d&#x27;Anjou ===
The Quai d&#x27;Anjou on the north side of the island, was named for Gaston, Duke of Orléans, the brother of Louis XIII. It was developed by Christophe Marie beginning in 1614. One prominent building is the house of Louis Le Vau, chief architect of the King (3 quai d&#x27;Anjou). Another prominent resident of the Quai was Abel-Francois Poisson (5 quai D&#x27;Anjou) the Marquis of Marigny and brother of Madame de Pompadour, superintendent of royal buildings for Louis XV. Later residents of the quai included the painter Honoré Daumier, (9 quai d&#x27;Anjou) who had a lithography workshop on the top floor. The poet Charles Baudelaire occupied a small apartment on the top floor in the courtyard at 17 Quai d&#x27;Anjou from 1843 to 1846.

===Quai de Bourbon===
The Quai de Bourbon was named for the royal family and has a series of very elegant townhouses constructed in the early 17th century. It was briefly the Quai de la Republique after the Revolution, but took back it original name in 1814. The house at 1 quai de Bourbon was occupied by Philippe de Champagne, a favorite artist of Cardinal Richelieu. The sculptor Camille Claudel lived at number 19 between 1899 and 1923, and had her workshop overlooking the courtyard, and remained here until she was sent to an insane asylum for thirty years.

The Pont Saint-Louis is the only bridge connecting the two islands, and is long. The first bridge, of wood, was built in 1634. The current bridge, the ninth, was opened in 1970.

=== Quai de Bethune ===

The Quai de Bethune runs along the southeast side of the island. It was built shortly after the assassination of Henry IV, and is named for the late king&#x27;s prime minister, Maximilien de Bethune, the Duke of Sully. The Pont de Sully bridge at the southeast end of the island also carries his name.

The quai was originally informally called the &quot;Quai des Balcons&quot; because the architect, Louis LeVau, promoted the idea that all of he buildings should have balconies, taking advantage of the southern exposure of he buildings. Residents of this quai over the years included the American cosmetics manufacturer Helena Rubenstein (24 quai de Bethune), who constructed the very few modern buildings on the island at 24 Quai de Bethune between 1934 and 1938. The carved masks of lions on the wooden door is the only vestige of the 17th century house. French president Georges Pompidou had his personal residence at 24 Quai de Bethune, in addition to his official residence. The French comedian Louis de Funès lived for a short time at the same address. Other celebrated residents of the quai included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Marie Curie, who lived at number 36 from 1912 until her death in 1934.

=== Quai d&#x27;Orleans ===


The Quai d&#x27;Orleans continues the Quai de Bethune to the west. Like the Quai d&#x27;Anjou, it is named for Gaston d&#x27;Orleans, the younger brother of Louis XIII. During the French Revolution, it was renamed the Quai d&#x27;Egalite until 1806. It joins the Quai de Bourbon at the Saint-Louis bridge, close to the western point of the island. Its notable buildings include the Polish Library (number 6 quai d&#x27;Orleans), originally built for Antoine Moreau, the secretary of Louis XIII. It became the Polish Library in 1838. This part of the island had other notable Polish connections; the Polish prince Czartoryski lived nearby on the side of Quai Anjou, and entertained Chopin, while Marie Curie lived nearby on the Quai Bethune. A notable fictional resident was Charles Swann, protagonist of the novel of Marcel Proust &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.

The responsibility for the development of the Île Saint-Louis in the 17th century was given to Christophe Marie, general builder for Public Works. In exchange for his pro bono work, he was granted a license to build elegant residences. Along with the nobles, aristocrats, wealthy businessmen and politicians came here to live away from the noise of the inner city. Marie went into partnership with two builders, Lugles Poulletier and François Le Regrattier, and chose Louis Le Vau as architect. In 1614 the ditch between the two islets was filled in; and townhouses were constructed between 1620 and 1650. The island project, an architectural revolution, used a carefully drafted urban plan for the first time in Paris. The urban planning was revolutionary, especially for Paris; it was only under Napoleon III, over 200 years later, that urban planning was implemented citywide. The option to build by just following the topography of the land was no longer available. The new streets were built straight and perpendicular to a central axis. So that the risk of fires was reduced, stone and slate replaced wood, plaster and thatched roofs.

For the first time, dwellings were orientated towards the outside, rather than towards an inner courtyard, with windows and balconies looking out to river views. Courtyards were narrow, with the usual gardens almost nonexistent. The majority of the façades were rather sober, providing charm to the neighborhood. Only a few façades were decorated with heads or faces (). Only a few of the balconies were adorned with ornate ironwork. The few monumental doors that horse-drawn coaches rushed through hinted at the wealth of the owners. Along with Faubourg Saint-Germain and Le Marais, Île Saint-Louis was one of the most affluent neighborhoods in 17th and 18th century Paris. The Pont Saint-Louis entertainers (i.e., jazz bands, jugglers and mimes) perform on a small bridge that connects Île Saint-Louis with Île de la Cité.

===Rue Saint-Louis-en-l&#x27;Île and the Hôtel Lambert===

The Rue Saint-Louis-en-l&#x27;Île is the main commercial street of the island. It is located in the center of the island, going east to west from one end to the other. Despite its commercial character, it still retains many early residential buildings, the most notable of which is Hôtel Lambert, located at the Quai Anjou on the eastern end of the island. This large town house, with a rotunda overlooking the Seine, was constructed beginning in 1640 by the royal architect, Louis Le Vau.

Due to the proximity of the site to the river it was not possible to follow the traditional model of a courtyard in the front and a garden in the back, so Le Vau built the garden and courtyard side by side, with the garden raised to the level of the first floor, or noble floor. The first interior painted decoration was done by Eustache Le Sueur; some of his original panels are now on display in the Louvre. The Hercules Gallery was designed by Charles Le Brun, whose future work for Louis XIV included the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles.

Over the years the house had a remarkable series of occupants. In the 18th century, it was purchased by the Marquis de Chatelet, whose wife, Émilie de Breteuil, was for fifteen years the mistress of Voltaire. It became the home of the Polish Prince and patriot Adam Czartoryski in 1843, and welcomed famous writers and musicians, including Balzac, George Sand, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and Frederic Chopin. In the 20th century, it was the home of actress Michèle Morgan, then, in 1975, the art collector Baron Guy de Rothschild, and after his death in 2007, Abdallah Al Thani, brother of the Emir of Qatar. It was seriously damaged by a fire in 2013 but restored.

===Church of Saint-Louis-en-l&#x27;Île===

The Church of Saint-Louis-en-l&#x27;Île, at 19 bis rue Saint-Louis-en-l&#x27;Ile, is the only church on the island. It was designed by the architect François Le Vau younger brother of the better-known royal architect Louis Le Vau. It was the only building he designed. The first stone was placed on 1 October 1664 by the Archbishop of Paris, but work was delayed by a shortage of funds and it was not completed until 14 July 1726.

The church lacks the traditional west front which had featured in the plans. Due to the delay in the construction, houses were built next to the church, taking the space. The original bell tower was destroyed by a storm in 1740, and was replaced by a new openwork tower. An unusual feature of the tower is the clock, which hangs over the street like a shop sign.

The interior is a good example of French Baroque architecture, with a central dome or cupola and an abundance of gold and white, a style borrowed from Italy. Pope Pius VII celebrated mass in the building in 1805, during his trip to Paris for the Coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte. The church interior was badly damaged during the French Revolution, but the damage was largely hidden in 1805 by hanging tapestries over the damaged walls. The church has a particularly fine organ, installed in 2005, and the church is frequently used as a venue for concerts.

=== Square Barye ===
Square Barye, on the southeast point of the island, is shaped like a prow of a ship pointing into the Seine. It was originally the site of a convent. It occupies , and is a popular park and garden. It takes its name from the 19th-century French sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye, who specialized in sculpture of animals. His work is prominently displayed in the square in front of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

The most prominent art work in the square is a sculpture of Barye depicting the combat between a mythological centaur and a lapith, made in 1894, and placed on a disproportionally large pedestal. The statue was removed and melted down for its bronze during World War II, but was replaced in 2011 with a copy financed by a Taiwanese donor.

<text>Trinitite, also known as atomsite or Alamogordo glass, is the glassy residue left on the desert floor after the plutonium-based Trinity nuclear bomb test on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The glass is primarily composed of arkosic sand composed of quartz grains and feldspar (both microcline and smaller amount of plagioclase with small amount of calcite, hornblende and augite in a matrix of sandy clay) that was melted by the atomic blast. It was first academically described in &quot;American Mineralogist&quot; in 1948.

It is usually a light green, although red trinitite was also found in one section of the blast site, and rare pieces of black trinitite formed. It is mildly radioactive but safe to handle. Pieces of the material remain at the Trinity site , although most of it was bulldozed and buried by the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1953.

==Formation==
In 2005 it was theorized by Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Robert E. Hermes and independent investigator William Strickfaden that much of the glass was formed by sand which was drawn up inside the fireball and then rained down in a liquid form. In a 2010 article in &quot;Geology Today&quot;, Nelson Eby of University of Massachusetts Lowell and Robert Hermes describe trinitite: 

This was supported by a 2011 study based on nuclear imaging and spectrometric techniques. Green trinitite is theorised by researchers to contain material from the bomb&#x27;s support structure, while red trinitite contains material originating from copper electrical wiring.

An estimated of heat energy went into forming the glass. As the temperature required to melt the sand into the observed glass form was about , this was estimated to have been the minimum temperature the sand was exposed to. Material within the blast fireball was superheated for an estimated 2–3 seconds before solidification. Relatively volatile elements such as zinc are found in decreasing quantities the closer the trinitite was formed to the centre of the blast. The higher the temperature, the more these volatile elements evaporated and were not captured as the material solidified.

The detonation left large quantities of trinitite scattered around the crater, with &quot;Time&quot; writing in September 1945 that the site took the appearance of &quot;[a] lake of green jade,&quot; while &quot;[t]he glass takes strange shapes—lopsided marbles, knobbly sheets a quarter-inch thick, broken, thin-walled bubbles, green, wormlike forms.&quot; The presence of rounded, beadlike forms suggests that some material melted after being thrown into the air and landed already formed, rather than remaining at ground level and being melted there. Other trinitite which formed on the ground contains inclusions of infused sand. This trinitite cooled rapidly on its upper surface, while the lower surface was superheated.

==Composition==
The chaotic nature of trinitite&#x27;s creation has resulted in variations in both structure and composition. The glass has been described as &quot;a layer 1 to 2 centimeters thick, with the upper surface marked by a very thin sprinkling of dust which fell upon it while it was still molten. At the bottom is a thicker film of partially fused material, which grades into the soil from which it was derived. The color of the glass is a pale bottle green, and the material is extremely vesicular with the size of the bubbles ranging to nearly the full thickness of the specimen.&quot; The most common form of trinitite is green fragments of 1–3 cm thick, smooth on one side and rough on the other; this is the trinitite that cooled after landing still-molten on the desert floor.

Around 30% of trinitite is void space, although quantities vary greatly between samples. Trinitite exhibits various other defects such as cracks. In trinitite that cooled after landing, the smooth upper surface contains large numbers of small vesicles while the lower rough layer has lower vesicle density but larger vesicles. It is primarily alkaline.

One of the more unusual isotopes found in trinitite is a barium neutron activation product, the barium in the Trinity device coming from the slow explosive lens employed in the device, known as Baratol. Quartz is the only surviving mineral in most trinitite. Trinitite no longer contains sufficient radiation to be harmful unless swallowed. It still contains the radionuclides 241Am, 137Cs and 152Eu owing to the Trinity test using a plutonium bomb.

==Variations==
There are two forms of trinitite glass with differing refraction indices. The lower-index glass is composed largely of silicon dioxide, with the higher-index variant having mixed components. Red trinitite exists in both variants and contains glass rich in copper, iron, and lead as well as metallic globules. Black trinitite&#x27;s colour is as a result of being rich in iron.

In a study published in 2021 a sample of red trinitite was found to contain a previously undiscovered complex quasicrystal, the oldest known manmade quasicrystal, with a symmetry group in the shape of an icosahedron. It is composed of iron, silicon, copper and calcium. The quasicrystal&#x27;s structure displays fivefold rotational symmetry. The quasicrystal research was led by geologist Luca Bindi of the University of Florence and Paul Steinhardt, after he theorised red trinitite was likely to contain quasicrystals as they often contain elements that rarely combine. The structure has a formula of . A single 10μm grain was detected after ten months of work examining six small samples of red trinitite.

==Nuclear forensics==

A 2010 study in the open access journal &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; examined trinitite&#x27;s potential value to the field of nuclear forensics. Prior to this research, it was assumed trinitite&#x27;s components fused identically and their original composition could not be discerned. The study demonstrated that glass from nuclear detonations could provide information about the device and associated components, such as packaging.

During the 2010s millions of dollars of research was undertaken examining trinitite to better understand what information such glasses held that could be used to understand the nuclear explosion that created them. The researchers theorized that trinitite analysis may be useful for forensically identifying perpetrators of a future nuclear attack.

Researchers involved with the discovery of the quasicrystal speculated their work could improve efforts to investigate nuclear weapons proliferation since quasicrystals do not decay, unlike other evidence produced by nuclear weapons testing. Trinitite has been chosen as a research subject partly because the nuclear test was well-documented. A 2015 study in the &quot;Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry&quot; funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration describes a method by which trinitite-like glass could be deliberately synthesized for use as test subjects for new nuclear forensic techniques. Laser ablation was first successfully used to identify the isotopic signature unique to the uranium within the bomb from a sample of trinitite, demonstrating this faster method&#x27;s effectiveness.

==Cultural impact==

Trinitite was not initially considered remarkable in the context of the nuclear test and ongoing war, but when the war ended visitors began to notice the glass and collect it as souvenirs. For a time it was believed that the desert sand had simply melted from the direct radiant thermal energy of the fireball and was not particularly dangerous. Thus, it was marketed as suitable for use in jewelry in 1945 and 1946. It is now illegal to take the remaining material from the site, much of which has been removed by the US government and buried elsewhere in New Mexico; however, material that was taken prior to this prohibition is still in the hands of collectors and available legally in mineral shops. Counterfeit trinitite is also on the market; trinitite&#x27;s authenticity requires scientific analysis. There are samples in the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the New Mexico Farm and Ranch Heritage Museum, and the Corning Museum of Glass; the National Atomic Testing Museum houses a paperweight containing trinitite. In the United Kingdom Science Museum Group&#x27;s collection contains a trinitite sample, as does the Canadian War Museum in Canada.

The SETI Institute, which seeks to find and research signs of intelligent life elsewhere in space, stated in 2021 that trinitite was to be included in their library of objects connected to &quot;transformational moments&quot; of potential interest to intelligent extraterrestrials. The sculpture &quot;Trinity Cube&quot; by Trevor Paglen, exhibited in 2019 at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego as part of a themed collection of Paglen&#x27;s art titled Sights Unseen, is partially made from trinitite. The c.1988 artwork &quot;Trinitite, Ground Zero, Trinity Site, New Mexico&quot; by photographer Patrick Nagatani is housed at the Denver Art Museum.

==Similar materials==
Occasionally, the name &quot;trinitite&quot; is broadly applied to all glassy residues of nuclear bomb testing, not just the Trinity test. Black vitreous fragments of fused sand that had been solidified by the heat of a nuclear explosion were created by French testing at the Reggane site in Algeria. Following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, it was discovered in 2016 that between 0.6% and 2.5% of sand on local beaches was fused glass spheres formed during the bombing. Like trinitite, the glass contains material from the local environment, including materials from buildings destroyed in the attack. The material has been called &quot;hiroshimaite&quot;. Kharitonchiki (singular: kharitonchik, ) is an analog of trinitite found in Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan at ground zeroes of Soviet atmospheric nuclear tests. The porous black material is named after one of the leading Russian nuclear weapons scientists, Yulii Borisovich Khariton.Trinitite, in common with several similar naturally occurring minerals, is a melt glass. While trinitite and materials of similar formation processes such as lavinite are anthropogenic, fulgurites, found in many thunderstorm-prone regions and in deserts, are naturally-formed, glassy materials and are generated by lightning striking sediments such as sand. Impactite, a material similar to trinitite, can be formed by meteor impacts. The Moon&#x27;s geology includes many rocks formed by one or more large impacts in which increasingly volatile elements are found in lower amounts the closer they are to the point of impact, similar to the distribution of volatile elements in trinitite.

<doc id="527989" wikidata="Q214548" url="?curid=527989" title="Andy Williams">
<text>Howard Andrew Williams (December 3, 1927 – September 25, 2012) was an American singer. He recorded 43 albums in his career, of which 15 have been gold certified and three platinum certified. He was also nominated for six Grammy Awards. He hosted &quot;the Andy Williams Show&quot;, a television variety show, from 1962 to 1971, along with numerous TV specials. &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; won three Emmy Awards. He sold more than 45 million records worldwide, including more than 10 million certified units in the United States.

Williams was active in the music industry for over 70 years until his death in September 2012 from bladder cancer, at the age of 84.

==Early life and education==
Williams was born in Wall Lake, Iowa, on December 3, 1927, to Florence (&quot;née&quot; Finley) and Jay Emerson Williams, who worked in insurance and the post office. While living in Cheviot, Ohio, Williams attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He finished high school at University High School, in West Los Angeles, because of his family&#x27;s move to California. At age 17, Williams joined the United States Merchant Marine and served until the end of World War II.

==Career==
===1938–1952: Early career===
Williams had three older brothers—Bob, Don, and Dick Williams. His first performance was in a children&#x27;s choir at the local Presbyterian church. His brothers and he formed the Williams Brothers quartet in late 1938, and they performed on radio in the Midwest, first at WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, and later at WLS in Chicago, and WLW in Cincinnati.

Moving to Los Angeles in 1943, the Williams Brothers sang with Bing Crosby on his 1944 hit record &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot;. They appeared in four musical films: &quot;Janie&quot; (1944), &quot;Kansas City Kitty&quot; (1944), &quot;Something in the Wind&quot; (1947), and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Man&quot; (1947).

A persistent myth alleges that as a teenager, the future singing star dubbed the singing for Lauren Bacall&#x27;s character in the 1944 feature film &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;. According to authoritative sources, including Howard Hawks and Bacall herself, this was not true. Williams and some female singers were tested to dub for Bacall because of fears that she lacked the necessary vocal skills, but those fears were overshadowed by the desire to have Bacall do her own singing despite her imperfect vocal talent.

The Williams Brothers were signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to appear in &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; and &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1945), but before they went before the cameras, the oldest brother, Bob, was drafted into military service and the group&#x27;s contract was cancelled. Kay Thompson, a former radio star who was now head of the vocal department at MGM, had a nose for talent and hired the remaining three Williams brothers to sing in her large choir on many soundtracks for MGM films, including &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; (1946). When Bob completed his military service, Kay hired all four brothers to sing on the soundtrack to &quot;Good News&quot; (1947).

By then, Thompson was tired of working behind the scenes at MGM, so with the four Williams boys as her backup singers and dancers, she formed a nightclub act, Kay Thompson and the Williams Brothers. They made their debut in Las Vegas in 1947 and became an overnight sensation. Within a year, they were the highest-paid nightclub act in the world, breaking records wherever they appeared.

Williams revealed in his memoir &quot;Moon River and Me&quot; that Thompson and he became romantically involved while on tour despite the age difference (he was 19 and she was 38). The act broke up in 1949, but reunited for another hugely successful tour from the fall of 1951 through the summer of 1953. After that, the four brothers went their separate ways. A complete itinerary of both tours is listed on the Kay Thompson biography website.

Williams and Thompson, however, remained very close, both personally and professionally. She mentored his emergence as a solo singing star. She coached him, wrote his arrangements, and composed many songs that he recorded, including his 1958 top-20 hit &quot;Promise Me, Love&quot;, and later, &quot;Kay Thompson&#x27;s Jingle Bells&quot; on his 1964 number-one &quot;The Andy Williams Christmas Album&quot;. Using her contacts in the business, Thompson helped Williams land his breakthrough television gig as a featured singer for two and a half years on &quot;Tonight Starring Steve Allen&quot;; it helped that the producer of the series, Bill Harbach, was Kay&#x27;s former &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;. Thompson also got Williams his breakthrough recording contract with Cadence Records, whose owner, Archie Bleyer, had gotten early career breaks because of Kay and owed her a favor. Meanwhile, Williams sang backup on many of Thompson&#x27;s recordings through the 1950s, including her top-40 hit &quot;Eloise&quot;, based on her bestselling books about the mischievous little girl who lives at the Plaza Hotel in New York.

Thompson also served as a creative consultant and vocal arranger on Williams&#x27;s three summer-replacement network television series in 1957, 1958, and 1959. In the summer of 1961, Thompson traveled with Williams and coached him throughout his starring role in a summer-stock tour of the musical &quot;Pal Joey&quot;. Their personal and professional relationship finally ended in 1962, after Williams met and married Claudine Longet, and Thompson moved to Rome.

===1953–1961: Cadence years===
Williams&#x27;s solo career began in 1953. He recorded six sides for RCA Victor&#x27;s label &quot;X&quot;, but none was a popular hit.

After landing a spot as a regular on the &quot;Tonight Starring Steve Allen&quot; in 1954, Williams was signed to a recording contract with Cadence Records, a small label in New York, run by conductor Archie Bleyer. Williams&#x27;s third single, &quot;Canadian Sunset&quot;, reached number seven in the top 10 in August 1956; it was followed in February 1957 by his only &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one hit, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, a cover of a Charlie Gracie record. &quot;Butterfly&quot; was also number one for two weeks on the UK Singles Chart in May 1957. More hit records followed, including &quot;Hawaiian Wedding Song&quot; (US number 11), &quot;Are You Sincere?&quot; (US number three in February 1958), &quot;The Village of St. Bernadette&quot; (US number seven in December 1959), &quot;Lonely Street&quot; (US number five in September 1959), and &quot;I Like Your Kind of Love&quot; with Peggy Powers (US number eight in May 1957).

===1962–1980: The Columbia years===

On December 15, 1961, Williams married Claudine Longet and signed with Columbia Records. His first album with Columbia, &quot;Danny Boy and Other Songs I Love to Sing&quot;, was a chart success, peaking at number 19. He was then asked to sing &quot;Moon River&quot;, the theme from &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, at the 1962 Academy Awards, where it won Best Original Song. Archie Bleyer at Cadence had previously told Williams that &quot;Moon River&quot; would not be a hit, but the Columbia producers encouraged Williams to record the song along with 11 other movie themes for an album. After Williams performed the song at the awards show, it became a hit. &quot;Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes&quot; then sold across the country, garnering critical acclaim and propelling Williams into stardom. The album remained on the charts for the next three years and peaked at number three. In 1963, Williams&#x27;s producer, Robert Mersey, encouraged him to record &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot; as the B-side to &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;. Williams initially did not like the pop song, preferring the Mancini tune, but &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot; reached number two in the US and UK. The album containing both songs, &quot;Days of Wine and Roses and Other TV Requests&quot;, topped the album charts at number one for 16 weeks.

From 1962 to 1972, Williams was one of the most popular vocalists in the country and was signed to what was at that time the biggest recording contract in history. He was primarily an album artist, and at one time, he had recorded more gold albums than any solo performer except Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, and Elvis Presley. By 1973, he had earned as many as 17 gold-album awards. Among his hit albums from this period were &quot;The Andy Williams Christmas Album&quot;, &quot;Dear Heart&quot;, &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot;, &quot;Love, Andy&quot;, &quot;Happy Heart&quot;, &quot;Get Together with Andy Williams&quot;, &quot;Love Story&quot;, and &quot;Love Theme from the Godfather&quot;. These recordings, along with his natural affinity for the music of the 1960s and early 1970s, combined to make him one of the premier easy-listening singers of that era.

In the UK, Williams continued to reach high chart status until 1978. The albums &quot;Dear Heart&quot; (1965), &quot;Love Andy&quot; (1967), &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; (1970), &quot;Andy Williams Show&quot; (1970), &quot;Home Lovin&#x27; Man&quot; (number one, 1971), &quot;Solitaire&quot; (1973), &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1974), and &quot;Reflections&quot; (1978) all reached the top 10.

Williams forged an indirect collaborative relationship with Henry Mancini, although they never recorded together. Both &quot;Moon River&quot; and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; were written by Mancini, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. Williams sang Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Dear Heart&quot; at the 1965 Academy Awards and &quot;The Sweetheart Tree&quot; (also written with Mercer) at the 1966 Awards.

On August 5, 1966, the 14-story, 700-room Caesars Palace casino and nightclub opened in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the stage production of &quot;Rome Swings&quot;, in which Williams starred. He performed to a sold-out crowd in the Circus Maximus showroom. He headlined for Caesars for the next 20 years.

On September 17, 1968, Columbia released a single of two songs Williams sang at the funeral of his close friend Robert F. Kennedy: &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; and Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot;. These were never released on a long-playing record, but have appeared in several compilations of Williams&#x27;s output.
Williams also competed in the teen-oriented singles market and had several charting hits, including &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot;, &quot;Happy Heart&quot;, and &quot;Where Do I Begin&quot;, the theme song from the 1970 blockbuster film &quot;Love Story&quot;. In addition, Williams hit the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Almost There&quot; (1964), &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; (1970), &quot;Home Lovin&#x27; Man&quot; (1970), and &quot;Solitaire&quot; (1973).

Williams and Petula Clark recorded &quot;Happy Heart&quot; around the same time, just before his guest appearance on her second NBC-TV special. Unaware that she was releasing the song as a single, he asked to perform it on the show. The exposure ultimately led to his having the bigger hit with the song. The song &quot;Happy Heart&quot; was used for the final scene and end credits of Danny Boyle&#x27;s award-winning directorial debut film &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; (1994).

===1962–1971: &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;===

Building on his experience with Allen and some short-term variety shows in the 1950s, he became the star of his own weekly television variety show in the fall of 1962. Though cancelled after 1963 owing to low ratings, the show was then sponsored to make 12 weekly specials in the 1963–64 season. This series, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, won three Emmy Awards for outstanding variety program. Among his series regulars were the Osmond Brothers. He gave up the variety show in 1971 while it was still popular, continuing with three specials per year. His Christmas specials, which appeared regularly until 1974 and intermittently from 1982 into the 1990s, were among the most popular of the genre. Williams recorded eight Christmas albums over the years, and was known as &quot;Mr. Christmas&quot;, due to his perennial Christmas specials and the success of &quot;It&#x27;s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot;.

Williams hosted the most Grammy telecasts—seven consecutive shows—from the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in 1971 through to the 19th Awards in 1977. He returned to television with a syndicated half-hour series in 1976–77.

In the early 1970s, when the Nixon administration attempted to deport John Lennon, Williams was an outspoken defender of the former Beatle&#x27;s right to stay in the United States. Williams is included in the montage of caricatures on the cover of Ringo Starr&#x27;s 1973 album, &quot;Ringo&quot;.

Williams performed during the halftime show of Super Bowl VII in January 1973, held at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

===1991–2012: At Moon River Theatre===
In June 1991, Williams&#x27; brother Don invited him to the small Ozarks town of Branson, Missouri. Don Williams at the time was the manager for entertainer Ray Stevens, who had just opened a theater in Branson. While attending Stevens&#x27; show, Williams was encouraged by numerous Branson guests to open a venue in the town. This led Williams to build his own theater in Branson in time for the 1992 season, eventually opening on May 1, 1992, as the Moon River Theatre. The name came from his signature song. It went on to become the first theater ever to be featured in &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, and also won the 1992 Conservation Award from the State of Missouri.

The theater was designed to blend with the rough terrain of the Ozark Mountains. He had originally planned a marble-style theater reminiscent of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, but soon had a change of mind. The Larson Company of Tucson, Arizona, fabricated a section of rock on Missouri&#x27;s Highway 76 and the theater was soon engulfed with waterfalls, koi-filled ponds, ferns, and trees native to the Ozarks. The inside of the theater incorporates the outside. Trees and plants are seen throughout the theater&#x27;s three lobbies. Oak floors are accompanied by African ribbon-striped mahogany walls that are filled with pictures of the &quot;Andy Williams Show&quot;. Williams&#x27; passion for art can be seen throughout, as well. From the start of his career, Williams had accumulated several paintings and sculptures and decided to fill his theater with his collection. Frankenthaler, Diebenkorn, Oldenburg, Pollock, Klee, and Moore are on a small list of artists whose work is on display at the Moon River Theatre.

The theater&#x27;s auditorium can accommodate 2,054 people. The seats and carpets match Williams&#x27; Navajo rug collection and are forest green, magenta, gold, and blue. On display inside the auditorium are 19 Japanese kimonos. The stage has accommodated numerous shows and guest celebrities. On stage, Williams was joined by Glen Campbell, Ann-Margret, Petula Clark, and Charo.

When it first opened, it was unique because his was the first noncountry act to open in the then mostly country-music town. Other noncountry entertainers, such as Bobby Vinton, Tony Orlando, Wayne Newton, and the Osmond Brothers soon followed.

Williams and his theater were featured on three episodes of the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in July 2007, when several characters went to Branson for a concert of &quot;Gwen Munson&quot; held in the Moon River Theatre. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; featured Williams at his Moon River Theatre in an episode titled &quot;Bart on the Road&quot;. Nelson Muntz is an Andy Williams fan, and in the episode, he forces the gang to make a detour to Branson so he could see his idol. He is reduced to tears as Williams performs &quot;Moon River&quot; during the second encore.

In 2007, Williams opened the Moon River Grill adjacent to his theater in Branson. The restaurant is decorated in photos from the &quot;Andy Williams Show&quot; with stars including Diana Ross, Elton John, and Sammy Davis Jr. Art is center stage in the restaurant, with works by several artists including Andy Warhol and Robert Indiana.

In 1995, &quot;We Need a Little Christmas&quot; became Williams&#x27;s 18th gold album.

His 1967 recording of &quot;Music to Watch Girls By&quot; became a UK hit to a new young television audience in 1999, when it reached number 9 after being featured in new television advertisements for the Fiat Punto—and later for Diet Pepsi—beating the original peak of number 33 in 1967. A new generation was reminded of Williams&#x27; recordings and a sell-out UK tour followed the success of the single, prompting a British revival for Williams. In 2002, he re-recorded &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; as a duet with British actress and singer Denise van Outen; it reached number 23 in the UK singles charts. He completed a sold-out tour of the United Kingdom and Asia in the winter and summer of 2007, in which he performed at several major concert halls including the Royal Albert Hall.

Williams returned to the UK singles charts with his 1963 recording of &quot;It&#x27;s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; in December 2007, due to an advertisement for Marks &amp; Spencer, reaching number 21 in its first appearance in the British charts. In 2008, he lip-synched the 45-year-old recording to welcome Santa at the end of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

On October 3, 2009, Williams appeared live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in London, singing &quot;Moon River&quot; to promote the UK edition of &quot;The Very Best of Andy Williams&quot; LP, which peaked at number 10 in the main pop chart.

==Business ventures==
In 1964, Williams ultimately became the owner of the Cadence master tapes, which he occasionally licensed to Columbia, including not only his own recordings, but also those of his fellow Cadence-era labelmates: the Everly Brothers, Lenny Welch, the Chordettes, Link Wray, and Johnny Tillotson. In 1968, although he was still under contract with Columbia for his own recordings, Williams formed a separate company called Barnaby Records to handle reissuing of the Cadence materials, especially those of the Everly Brothers (one of the first Barnaby LPs was a double LP set of the Brothers&#x27; long out-of-print Cadence hits) and new artists. Barnaby also had several top-40 hits in the 1970s with novelty artist Ray Stevens (who had done a summer replacement show for Williams in 1970), including number-one hits such as &quot;Everything Is Beautiful&quot; in 1970 and &quot;The Streak&quot; in 1974. Also in 1970, Barnaby signed and released the first album by an unknown singer-songwriter named Jimmy Buffett (&quot;Down to Earth&quot;) produced by Travis Turk.

Columbia was initially the distributor for Barnaby, but later distribution was handled first by MGM Records and then General Recorded Tape. Once Barnaby ceased operating as a working record company at the end of the 1970s, Williams licensed the old Cadence material to various other labels (such as Varèse Sarabande and Rhino in the U.S.) after 1980.

==Politics==
Williams was close friends with Robert F. Kennedy and his wife, Ethel Kennedy, and campaigned for Kennedy in the 1968 Democratic presidential primary races. Williams was among the celebrities who were in Kennedy&#x27;s entourage in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Kennedy was shot and mortally wounded by Sirhan Sirhan in June 1968. Williams sang &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; at RFK&#x27;s funeral, at Ethel&#x27;s request. In August 1969, Williams and Claudine Longet named their newborn son Bobby, after Kennedy. The Williams&#x27; friendship with Ethel Kennedy endured, with Williams serving as escort to Ethel at events in the 1970s. He also raised funds for George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign, performing at benefit concerts.

Williams later said that despite his friendship with the Democratic Kennedys, he was a lifelong Republican. In 2009, he was quoted by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as accusing President Barack Obama of &quot;following Marxist theory&quot; and &quot;wanting the country to fail&quot;. Williams gave Rush Limbaugh permission to use his recording of the song &quot;Born Free&quot; as the theme to the &quot;Animal Rights Update&quot; on Limbaugh&#x27;s radio show—in which a portion of the song was then followed by gunfire—saying &quot;Hey, it&#x27;s fine with me. I love what you&#x27;re doing with it.&quot; The record company later blocked Limbaugh&#x27;s use of the recording. Williams was a guest on the &quot;Glenn Beck Radio Program&quot; in December 2009, introduced by his own 1960s recording of &quot;Little Altar Boy&quot;.

==Personal life==

Williams met French-born Claudine Longet in Las Vegas when her car broke down and he offered help. She was a dancer at the time at the Folies Bergère. They married on December 15, 1961, and over the next eight years, they had three children—Noelle, Christian (died 2019), and Robert.
After separating in 1970, Williams and Longet divorced in 1975, but they remained friends.
In March 1976, Longet was charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, alpine ski racer Spider Sabich, in Aspen. Williams played a public role in the subsequent events, escorting her to and from the courtroom, testifying to her character at the trial, and providing legal assistance. Longet claimed the shooting was accidental and eventually served 30 days in jail.

Williams also had partial ownership of the Phoenix Suns NBA team from the team&#x27;s inception in 1968 until 1987.

On May 3, 1991, Williams married Debbie Haas, &quot;née&quot; Meyer, whom he met through a mutual friend. They made their homes at Branson, Missouri, and La Quinta, California, where he was known as the &quot;honorary mayor&quot;. Williams was a noted collector of modern art and his homes have been featured in &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;.

Williams&#x27; birthplace in Iowa is a tourist attraction and is open most of the year.

===Hobbies===
Williams was an avid golfer and hosted a PGA Tour golf tournament in San Diego from 1968 to 1988 at Torrey Pines. Then known as the &quot;Andy Williams San Diego Open&quot;, the tournament continues as the Farmers Insurance Open, usually played in February. He was also a competent ice skater and occasionally skated as part of his television Christmas shows.
Williams was a noted art collector whose collection had hung in his homes, his offices, and in the Moon River Theatre, and was exhibited at the Saint Louis Art Museum in 1997 and 1998. After his death, his collection was split among several auction houses. His paintings went to Christie&#x27;s New York, where they fetched over $50 million. His folk art collection was sold at Skinner for $2,471,725. His collection of Navajo blankets was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s on May 21, 2013, yielding $978,506 (£642,064).

==Illness and death==

In a surprise appearance at his theater in November 2011, Williams announced that he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer. After chemotherapy treatment in Houston, his wife and he moved to a rented home in Malibu, California, to be closer to cancer specialists in the Los Angeles area.

On September 25, 2012, Williams died of bladder cancer at the age of 84 at his home in Branson, Missouri. Williams&#x27; body was cremated, and his ashes were sprinkled into the artificial waterway named Moon River at his theater in Branson. The memorial service for Williams was held a month later.

==Awards and achievements==
&quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; won three Emmy Awards in 1963, 1966, and 1967 for Outstanding Variety Series.

Andy Williams also earned six Grammy nominations:
Other honors include:
*Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award, 2008

<text>In Vajrayana Buddhism, the Diamond Realm (Skt. वज्रधातु &quot;vajradhātu&quot;, Traditional Chinese: 金剛界; Pinyin: &quot;Jīngāngjiè&quot;; Romaji: &quot;Kongōkai&quot;) is a metaphysical space inhabited by the Five Tathagatas. The Diamond Realm Mandala is based on an esoteric Buddhist sutra called the &quot;Vajrasekhara Sutra&quot;.

The Diamond Realm is a very popular subject for mandalas, and along with the Womb Realm (&quot;garbhakoṣadhātu&quot;) Mandala forms the Mandala of the Two Realms. This mandala, along with the Womb Realm, form the core of Chinese Tangmi and Japanese Shingon rituals, including the initiation or abhiṣeka ritual. In this ritual, new initiates are blindfolded, and are asked to toss a flower upon a mandala. Where the flower lands helps decide which Buddhist figure the student should devote themselves to.

In traditional Tangmi and Shingon halls, the Diamond Realm Mandala is hung on the west wall symbolizing the final realization of Mahāvairocana Buddha. In this setting, the Womb Realm Mandala is hung on the east wall, symbolizing the young stage of Mahāvairocana Buddha.

In Chinese Buddhism, the Diamond Realm Mandala is also associated with the Yogacara Flaming Mouth Ritual (瑜伽焰口法會), which is often conducted during the Chinese Ghost Festival in order to feed pretas and reduce their suffering. Part of the ritual involves the performing ritual master wearing a Vairocana crown which is adorned with images of the Five Tathāgatas. The textual tradition for this part of the ritual asserts that the thirty-seven deities which make up the Diamond Realm Mandala are installed in the crown and that these deities confer their blessings and powers on the ritual master during the performance of the ritual.

<text>The Trío Matamoros was a Cuban trova group. It was formed in 1925 by Miguel Matamoros (8 May 1894 in Santiago de Cuba – 15 April 1971; guitar), Rafael Cueto (14 March 1900 in Santiago de Cuba – 7 August 1991; guitar) and Siro Rodríguez (9 December 1899 in Santiago de Cuba – Regla, 29 March 1981; maracas and claves). All three were singers and composers. The group was originally called Trio Oriental, but changed their name to Trio Matamoros in 1928 after finding that a group called Trio Oriental already existed.

The Trío Matamoros played boleros and son. They toured all Latin America and Europe and recorded in New York. In 1940 Guillermo Portabales performed with the trio. Matamoros expanded the trio into a conjunto (Conjunto Matamoros) for a trip to Mexico and hired the young Beny Moré as singer from 1945 to 1947. They recorded many 78 rpm records and LPs; some of their output is available on CDs. The group were critically acclaimed for the harmony of their voices, and the quality of the lyrics.

The group is considered an important act in the rise of son music. Throughout the nearly four decades that it was active, the group re-configured itself into many musical variations and acts as a quartet, septet, orchestra, etc.

Miguel Matamoros was one of the most prolific composers of Cuban son. His first hit was &quot;El que siembra su maíz&quot; (He who sows his corn), followed by songs including &quot;Lágrimas negras&quot; (Black tears) and &quot;Son de la Loma.&quot; The group, whose members stayed together for 35 years, announced their disbandment in May 1961. Their last concert had taken place in New York the year before.

<text>Frank &quot;Son&quot; Seals (August 14, 1942 – December 20, 2004) was an American electric blues guitarist and singer.

In 2009, Seals was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Seals was born in Osceola, Arkansas, where his father, Jim &quot;Son&quot; Seals, owned a small juke joint, called the Dipsy Doodle Club. He began performing professionally by the age of 13, first as a drummer with Robert Nighthawk and later as a guitarist. At age 16, he began to play at the T-99, a local upper-echelon club, with his brother-in-law Walter &quot;Little Walter&quot; Jefferson. He played there with prominent blues musicians, including Albert King, Rufus Thomas, Bobby Bland, Junior Parker, and Rosco Gordon. Their varying styles contributed to the development of Seals&#x27;s own playing techniques. While playing at the T-99, he was also introduced to country-western music by Jimmy Grubbs, who occasionally asked Seals to play the drums or guitar with his group. At the age of 19, Seals formed his own band, Son Seals and the Upsetters, to fill in at the Rebel Club, in Osceola. The band members were Johnny Moore (&quot;Old Man Horse&quot;) on piano; Alvin Goodberry on drums, guitar, bass, or piano; Little Bob Robinson on vocals; and Walter Lee &quot;Skinny Dynamo&quot; Harris on piano. Shortly thereafter, a man from Little Rock, Arkansas, came to find &quot;Little Walter&quot; for a gig at his club, but when Walter turned it down the offer went to Seals.

In 1971, Seals moved to Chicago. His career took off after he was discovered by Bruce Iglauer of Alligator Records at the Flamingo Club on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. His debut album, &quot;The Son Seals Blues Band&quot;, was released in 1973. The album included &quot;Your Love Is Like a Cancer&quot; and &quot;Hot Sauce&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Midnight Son&quot; (1976) and &quot;Live and Burning&quot; (1978). Seals released several albums in the next two decades, all but one on Alligator Records, including &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; (1980), &quot;Bad Axe&quot; (1984), &quot;Living in the Danger Zone&quot; (1991), &quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot; (1994) and &quot;Live: Spontaneous Combustion&quot; (1996). He received W.C. Handy Awards in 1985, 1987, and 2001.

The writer Andrew Vachss, a friend of his, used his influence to promote Seals&#x27;s music. Vachss gave Seals several cameo appearances in his novels, and co-wrote songs with him for his album &quot;Lettin&#x27; Go&quot;, released in 2000. Vachss dedicated his novel &quot;Mask Market&quot; to Seals&#x27;s memory.

In 2002, Seals contributed to the Bo Diddley tribute album, &quot;Hey Bo Diddley – A Tribute!&quot;, performing the song &quot;My Story&quot; (also known as &quot;Story of Bo Diddley&quot;).

Seals had a hard life. He survived all but one of his fourteen siblings. In 1997 he was shot in the jaw by his wife, sustaining injuries which required reconstructive surgery. In 1999 part of his left leg was amputated as a result of complications from diabetes. He lost belongings in a fire that destroyed his home while he was away performing, and several of his prized guitars were stolen from his home. After his health began to decline, Seals toured with accompaniment by several different bands, including those of James Soleberg, Jimmy Vivino, and Big Jim Kohler.

The band Phish performed Seals&#x27;s song &quot;Funky Bitch&quot; and brought him on stage on several occasions. In 1999, Seals performed at Camp Oswego, the only one of Phish&#x27;s multi-day summer festivals that included performances by artists other than themselves.

Seals died in 2004, at the age of 62, from complications of diabetes.

In 2009, Seals was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, in the category &#x27;Performer&#x27;.

<text>State University of New York at Oswego (SUNY Oswego or Oswego State) is a public university in Oswego, New York. It has a total student population of 6,756 and the campus size is 700 acres. SUNY Oswego offers more than 120 undergraduate, graduate and professional based programs in four colleges: School of Business, School of Communication, Media and the Arts, School of Education, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

==History==
SUNY Oswego was founded in 1861 as the Oswego Primary Teachers Training School by Edward Austin Sheldon, who introduced a revolutionary teaching methodology Oswego Movement in American education. In 1942 the New York Legislature elevated it from a normal school to a degree-granting teachers&#x27; college, Oswego State Teachers College, which was a founding and charter member of the State University of New York system in 1948. In 1962 the college broadened its scope to become a liberal arts college.

==Campus==
Most of the campus is in the Town of Oswego, including the census-designated place. Portions of the campus are in Oswego City.

Founded in the city of Oswego, the university was created to train teachers to meet pressing educational needs. SUNY Oswego moved to its current location on the shore of Lake Ontario in 1913 after Sheldon Hall was constructed. The current campus is located on along Lake Ontario. Development of the campus was planned by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, who designed the major buildings.

The campus today consists of 46 buildings with classrooms, laboratories, residential and athletic facilities. Recent years have witnessed the launch of a $700 million campus-wide renovation and renewal program, with the new Campus Center acting as the social hub of campus.
The university&#x27;s social hub, known as the Marano Campus Center Complex, opened in the fall of 2007, and includes new construction and renovation of the existing Swetman/Poucher complex. The $25.5 million Marano Campus Center portion, the new construction, includes the Deborah. F. Stanley Arena and Convocation Hall and several academic departments.

===The Tyler Art Gallery===
Tyler Art Gallery is located within the Tyler Hall. The gallery showcases local and traveling exhibitions, exhibitions of faculty work and student exhibitions. Students curate and have sole responsibility for the annual exhibition of student work. The gallery&#x27;s permanent collection comprises European, African, and American drawings, prints, paintings, ceramics and sculpture that date from the 18th century to the present, including several works by artist Sacha Kolin. One subsection of the permanent collection, the Grant Arnold Collection of Fine Prints, contains over 500 prints by American printmakers from the first half of the twentieth century. Tyler Hall is in the process of significant renovations, with the first phase completed for a fall 2016 reopening.

===Other buildings===

Physically separate from the main campus, on the other side of New York State Route 104, is the south campus, consisting of Laker Hall (indoor sports, coaching classrooms, and athletic training rooms), Romney Fieldhouse (a Quonset hut that hosted the Laker hockey program until fall 2006) and several athletic fields. In addition, more than of Rice Creek Field Station (for biological research and public programs) are on the South Campus.

West Campus, along with Laker Hall, Hewitt Hall (which hosted most of the student organizations until the Campus Center&#x27;s opening in 2006), Tyler Hall, Culkin Hall (the administrative building), Penfield Library, Lanigan Hall (consisting of large lecture halls) and Mahar Hall are all built in the Brutalist style and date to the early 1970s.

==Accreditations==
Middle States accredited with additional accreditations. The institution&#x27;s MBA program has been internationally accredited by AACSB. SUNY Oswego&#x27;s School of Education is accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation. Oswego&#x27;s School of Business has international accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. SUNY Oswego programs in Electrical and Computing Engineering as well as Software Engineering are accredited by ABET. SUNY Oswego is one of the few universities in New York state whose art, music, and theater departments are all nationally accredited.

==Schools and colleges==
* College of Liberal Arts and Sciences houses the departments of Anthropology, Atmospheric and Geological Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, English and Creative Writing, History, Human Development, Mathematics, Modern Languages and Literatures, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Criminal Justice, Sociology

== Library ==
Penfield Library is the only academic library on campus. It is named after Lida S. Penfield (1873–1956), once chair of the English department. The current facility opened in 1968, replacing a library of the same name in what is now Rich Hall. The library is home to the Millard Fillmore and Marshall Family Papers and numerous digitized collections including the Fort Ontario Emergency Refugee Shelter (Safe Haven) papers.

==Athletics==
The university offers 24 intercollegiate varsity sports. SUNY Oswego&#x27;s athletic teams are known officially as the Great Lakers but often referred to simply as the Lakers. Oswego is a member of NCAA Division III and teams compete in the State University of New York Athletic Conference for most sports. Women&#x27;s ice hockey plays in the ECAC West, as that sport is not offered by the SUNYAC.

Oswego is traditionally a rival of Plattsburgh State. The rivalry currently manifests mostly in ice hockey; in the 1990s and early 2000s, Oswego fans would regularly throw bagels onto the ice when the Lakers scored against Plattsburgh, responding to a tradition where Plattsburgh fans threw tennis balls on the rink after goals versus Oswego. The tradition ended in 2006, after Oswego was assessed a delay of game penalty for the bagel throw: Plattsburgh scored on the ensuing power-play to win the game, which cost the Lakers a national tournament berth. In addition, the Campus Center arena was opened that year which allowed the university to more closely monitor and shut down fans who brought in bagels. The &quot;Puck Flattsburgh&quot; spoonerism is a common rallying cry. Oswego and Plattsburgh also had a rivalry in football, but Oswego ceased sponsoring the sport in 1976, with Plattsburgh following in 1978.

==Traditions==

* Bridge Street Run – The Bridge Street Run is a pub crawl that now takes place during the spring semester on the last Friday before finals week. Students put on white T-shirts, start at the Front Door Tavern on East 10th and Utica Streets, and make their way down Bridge Street (New York State Route 104) in Oswego. They stop at all participating bars along the way on or within a block of Bridge Street to have their shirts signed. The event has been a tradition in various forms at SUNY Oswego for over 30 years. The college officially discourages the practice. It was finally banned by the city in 2014 following a students death caused by a heroin overdose on campus; the following year, the college set up OzFest, a campus festival, to deter partiers from participating in the Bridge Street Run. However, students still continue the tradition each spring.

<doc id="528005" wikidata="Q2093965" url="?curid=528005" title="Pierre Vallières">
<text>Pierre &quot;PK&quot; Vallières (22 February 1938 – 23 December 1998) was a Canadian journalist and writer, known as an intellectual leader of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ). He was the author of the essay &quot;Nègres blancs d&#x27;Amérique&quot;, which likened the struggles of French-Canadians to those of African-Americans.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Pierre Vallières was born on 22 February 1938, in Montreal, Quebec, into a French-Canadian family. Vallières grew up in Ville Jacques-Cartier (now part of Longueuil) in the South Shore region, considered one of the most deprived areas of the Montreal metropolitan area. He entered the Franciscan Order but left after a couple of years. He worked in a bookstore before becoming a journalist, first for &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, and then for &quot;Cité Libre&quot;, for which he later became the director. He then went to cover international news for &quot;La Presse&quot;.

===FLQ and &quot;Nègres blancs d&#x27;Amérique&quot;===
Vallières had been working for &quot;La Presse&quot; for two years when he was fired for taking part in &quot;subversive activities&quot;, having become a left-wing political activist at a young age. In September 1964, Vallières and Charles Gagnon published of the first issue of left-wing &quot;Révolution québécoise&quot; magazine. In July 1965, Vallières and Gagnon led the &quot;Fourth Wave&quot; of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), a separatist and Marxist-Leninist paramilitary group in Quebec, when they combined the remains of the &quot;Third Wave&quot; with their Popular Liberation Movement. Vallières published the group&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;La Cognée&quot; (&quot;The Hit&quot;), and was involved in militant activities. The FLQ&#x27;s bombing campaign prompted a quick clampdown by Canadian authorities, and by August 1966, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had arrested many FLQ members.

Vallières escaped the arrests and fled to the United States with Gagnon, where they conducted a hunger strike at the United Nations headquarters in New York City to protest what was considered to be Quebec&#x27;s plight in Canada. While in New York, Vallières was held in the Manhattan House of Detention for Men before being extradited back to Canada, where he was immediately arrested in connection with the robbery of a Montreal cinema on 27 August 1966. Vallières, along with Charles Gagnon and five other people, was convicted of the manslaughter of Thérèse Morin, a 64-year-old secretary who died in the explosion of a bomb that was delivered to the H. B. La Grenade shoe manufacturer in Montreal on 5 May 1966, and of Jean Corbo, a 16-year-old FLQ member who died on 14 July 1966 in the explosion of the bomb he had placed himself at the Dominion Textile factory in Montreal. Vallières received a life sentence for the deaths, but the conviction was overturned by the court of appeal, and in a second trial held in 1969, he was convicted again and this time sentenced to 30 months in prison. He was paroled on 26 May 1970 after spending 44 months in prison.

Vallières wrote a number of works during his four-month imprisonment in New York in 1967, the most famous of which was &quot;Nègres blancs d&#x27;Amérique&quot; (1968), translated into English as &quot;White Niggers of America&quot;. The book compared the historical situation of French-Canadians to that of African-Americans at the height of the latter&#x27;s civil rights struggles, where Vallières argued the parallels between the two peoples as an exploited lower class, and called for armed struggle of liberation against their common aristocratic oppressors.

===Later life and death===
In 1970, during the October Crisis, the FLQ abducted and murdered Pierre Laporte, the Vice-Premier of Quebec. The following year, Vallières renounced violence as a means to achieve Quebec independence, and on 4 October 1972, under a plea bargain agreement, received a one-year suspended sentence on three charges of counselling kidnapping for political purposes. Vallières then resumed his career as a journalist, writer, and publisher.

Vallières died from heart failure on 23 December 1998, at the Jacques-Viger Hospital in Montreal.

<doc id="528010" wikidata="Q762479" url="?curid=528010" title="Temasek (company)">
<text>Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited ( ) is a Singaporean state-owned multinational investment firm. Incorporated on 25 June 1974, Temasek has a net portfolio of US$288 billion (S$389 billion) as of 2024, with S$33 billion divested and S$26 billion invested during the year. Headquartered at Orchard Road, Singapore, it has 13 offices in 9 countries around the world, including in Beijing, Brussels, Hanoi, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, New York City, Paris, San Francisco, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Washington D.C. 

It is an active shareholder and investor, with four key structural trends guiding its long term portfolio construction—Digitisation, Sustainable Living, Future of Consumption, and Longer Lifespans. Temasek&#x27;s portfolio covers a broad spectrum of sectors. Its key focus investment areas include Consumer, Media &amp; Technology, Life Sciences &amp; Agri-Food, and Non-Bank Financial Services. 

Temasek has held overall corporate global credit ratings of “Aaa/AAA” by rating agencies Moody&#x27;s and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s respectively since its inaugural credit ratings in 2004. It has also attained perfect quarterly scores on the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index, a measure of the openness of government-owned investment funds. Temasek is primarily anchored in Asia, but with a global portfolio, with a 64% underlying exposure to developed economies.

While Temasek is largely considered as being a sovereign wealth fund (SWF), there are major differences as it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets and companies, and pays taxes like other commercial investment firms. 
Temasek&#x27;s one-year total shareholder return (TSR) was 1.60%, with longer term 10-year and 20-year TSRs at 6% and 7% respectively, compounded annually. Its TSR since inception was 14%, compounded over 50 years. In addition to Temasek, the Government of Singapore also owns GIC Private Limited, a traditional SWF which manages about US$744 billion (S$1.006 trillion) of assets as of 2022 and the compulsory pension programme Central Provident Fund (CPF) with assets of US$397 billion (S$540 billion), giving a total publicly known AUM of approximately US$1.64 trillion. 

==Status==
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a statutory board. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays taxes that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is the Singapore Minister for Finance.

Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule entity under the Constitution of Singapore, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government&#x27;s past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek&#x27;s cash reserves. The president also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek&#x27;s board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.

In a 2009 speech, Ho Ching, then Temasek Holdings&#x27; Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance. She noted that Temasek&#x27;s bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly and independently monitored as public markers of Temasek&#x27;s financial position and credit risks. Temasek had also openly and accurately disclosed its financial information through its annual report (although Ho said that, as a private company, it was not legally obliged to do so).

==History==
At the point of Singapore&#x27;s independence in August 1965, the Government of Singapore had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (later split up into Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became Singapore Telecommunications and subsequently Singtel). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government&#x27;s Economic Development Board (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies. During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies, such as the Keppel Corporation (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the Royal Navy after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), ST Engineering (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the Singapore Armed Forces), and the shipping company Neptune Orient Lines.

On 25 June 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government, named for an early settlement on the island. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis, allowing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to focus on policymaking.

In February 2020, Temasek announced a company-wide wage freeze and voluntary pay cuts for senior management in part to help fund community programs aimed at alleviating the impact of COVID-19.

On 1 October 2021, Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, the current chief executive officer of Temasek International (TI), succeeded Ho Ching as executive director and chief executive officer of Temasek Holdings.

==Investments==
Temasek&#x27;s initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares previously held by the Singapore Government, including a bird park, a hotel, a shoemaker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill.

===2000s===
Temasek&#x27;s 2006 acquisition of Shin Corporation, owned by the family of then Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok. The deal was a factor in exacerbating the Thai political crisis, which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction&#x27;s legality. The military junta that overthrew Thaksin later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp. As of 2015, Temasek&#x27;s stake in Intouch Corporation (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%. In 2016, Temasek sold a further 21% stake in Intouch Holdings, the Thai telecoms conglomerate formerly known as Shin Corp.

===2010s===
Beginning in 2015, Temasek began making large investments in agricultural and agricultural-related companies and ventures.

In June 2018, Temasek invested S$340 million in a minority stake in UST Global, a digital technology services company. The size of the stake was not disclosed.

In February 2019, Temasek invested in Zilingo.

Temasek purchased 30 per cent of Haldor Topsoe&#x27;s shares in March 2019. The investment company was selected in recognition of the value that it would add through its deep insights and connections in Asian growth and other emerging markets, according to the Danish engineering firm. The transaction price was not disclosed.

===2020s===
In August 2020, Temasek Holdings added a 3.9 per cent stake in BlackRock Inc, worth about US$3.5 billion, becoming one of its largest shareholders. According to people familiar with the matter, Temasek was one of several players that bought the money manager&#x27;s shares when PNC Financial Services Group Inc. sold a US$14 billion stake earlier in the year. Temasek and BlackRock created the joint venture Decarbonization Partners, which invests in companies that work to accelerate the decarbonization of the global economy.

In November 2020 Temasek with Creadev led a EUR140 million series C financing of French biotechnology company InnovaFeed.

In 2021, Temasek invested in cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Following FTX&#x27;s collapse in November 2022, Temasek wrote down the value of their $275 million investment in FTX to zero.

In February 2022, Temasek led a $200 million fundraising round for a Singaporean cryptocurrency financing company, Amber Group.

In May 2022, Temasek was finalizing talks to lead a $50 million financing round for DotPe, an Indian startup backed by Google. The same year, the company together with Ventury Partners led a $108 million financing round for Indian startup Country Delight. 

In August 2022, Temasek leads a $100 million financing round for Animoca Brands.

In April 2023, Temasek announced that it would acquire an additional 41 per cent stake in Bengaluru-based Manipal Health Enterprises (MHE), resulting in a total stake of 59 per cent. In October 2023, Temasek participated in a $1.7 billion fundraising round for parking technology company Metropolis Technologies.

In June 2024, Temasek was finalizing its sale of some assets from liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading company Pavilion Energy to Shell, with the deal worth hundreds of millions of US dollars.

In December 2024, Temasek announced its establishment of a private credit entity whose initial portfolio amounted to $7.5 billion, which considered direct investments and credit funds.

== Sustainability ==
As a company, Temasek has been carbon neutral since 2020. The firm has publicly stated that its goal is to reduce the net carbon emissions attributed to its entire portfolio to half of 2010 levels by 2030. It aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In 2024, the company launched its inaugural sustainability report, stating that portfolio emissions were cut by 22 per cent for the financial year. Their sustainability-aligned investments accounted for 12 per cent of their net portfolio value and stood at $44 billion.

<doc id="528019" wikidata="Q2537566" url="?curid=528019" title="Playing It Straight">
<text>Playing It Straight is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The series premiered on March 12, 2004, although it was prematurely cancelled by the network following the broadcast of its third episode on March 26, 2004. Set at the Sizzling Saddle Ranch in Elko, Nevada, the series depicted fourteen men who attempted to pursue a romantic relationship with college student Jackie Thomas. However, this group of suitors was split between men who identified as straight and gay. Through a series of group activities and one-on-one dates, Thomas was required to eliminate men from the competition who she believed identified as gay. If the final suitor was a straight man, he and Thomas split a reward of $1 million. Conversely, if the final suitor was a gay man, he alone won the reward. The series was hosted by American television presenter Daphne Brogdon.

&quot;Playing It Straight&quot; was a part of Fox&#x27;s intent to capitalize on a rising interest in LGBT-themed reality television shows. The series&#x27; format was inspired by &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, with the addition of an LGBT-related twist. &quot;Playing It Straight&quot; was met with criticism from many television critics, who claimed that it reinforced stereotypes and promoted a negative portrayal of gay men. The series premiered to modest ratings, which declined with the broadcast of subsequent episodes. Following its mid-season cancellation, Fox released the full series on their website on a pay-per-view basis. The cancellation of &quot;Playing It Straight&quot; caused some network executives to reevaluate their own LGBT-related television shows. The series spawned adaptations in Australia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

==Format==

Set in Elko, Nevada, at the Sizzling Saddle Ranch, the series followed Jackie Thomas, a 21-year-old college student from Wisconsin, as she was pursued by a group of fourteen men. Upon arrival to the ranch, Thomas learned that the group was composed of both straight and gay men; all of the gay men attempted to pass as straight throughout the course of the competition. Thomas was required to discern which of the men identified as gay; she made her determinations based on observations from a series of individual and group dates. These dates included activities such as shopping trips and swimsuit competitions. At the end of each week, Jackie was required to eliminate two men from the competition who she believed to be gay. Following their elimination, each man had the opportunity to disclose their sexual orientation and explain their reason for participating in the series. If Thomas ultimately selected a straight man at the end of the competition, then the two split a reward of $1,000,000. Conversely, if Thomas selected a gay man at the end of the competition, then he alone won the reward. The series was hosted by American television presenter Daphne Brogdon.

==Production==
===Concept and development===
In February 2003, Kim MacQuarrie and Ciara Byrne were asked by Lion Television to come up with five proposals for a reality television series for the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). MacQuarrie and Byrne had five days to submit their proposals, with the pair &quot;rack[ing] our brains for reality series ideas that might be fun, rather than the dramatic series that were currently on television.&quot; After ten days of deliberation, Fox selected the pair&#x27;s fourth proposal, a dating series that revolved around one woman and fourteen men, some of whom were gay.

Production for &quot;Playing It Straight&quot; began in mid-2003 under the working title &quot;Who Will She Choose?&quot; The series took approximately ten months to design, cast, film, and produce. All crew, staff, and contestants were required to sign non-disclosure agreements in the amount of $5 million.

&quot;Variety&quot; initially reported that the series was a potential cover for a new season of the reality dating show &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;.

In 2005, nearly one year later after the show was recorded, Fox issued a press release stating that Jackie and Banks were still together. After the show, Jackie and Banks dated for about two years. For the first eight months, they had to keep their relationship quiet until the show aired. Banks went so far as to tell friends that he had to leave the show because he broke his arm, rather than reveal he won.

===Filming===
&quot;Playing It Straight&quot; was filmed at Red&#x27;s Ranch in Elko, Nevada; however, it was renamed Sizzling Saddles Ranch for the series. According to MacQuarrie, he intentionally chose to film the series at Red&#x27;s Ranch. He stated: &quot;It was filmed on Red&#x27;s Ranch ... because I grew up in Nevada, but also so that we could have fun taking 14 greenhorns—gay and straight—to a place where they would all be &#x27;fish out of water.&#x27;&quot;

==Episodes==
==Reception==
===Television viewership and ratings===
&quot;Playing It Straight&quot; premiered to modest ratings, in which it received 5.3 million viewers. It was the highest-rated program of the night among several demographics, including adults 18–34, persons 12–34, teens and men 18–34. The series averaged 3.9 million viewers and a 1.7 rating/6 share among adults 18-49 over the course of its three-week run.

===Critical response===
&quot;Playing It Straight&quot; received generally unfavorable reviews from television critics. Dana Stevens of &quot;Slate&quot; criticized the series for portraying gay men as &quot;romantic pariahs.&quot; She further commented: &quot;[N]ot only is &quot;Playing It Straight&quot; ideologically offensive, it’s also colossally boring.&quot;

==Cancellation==
On March 29, 2004, following the broadcast of its third episode, &quot;Playing It Straight&quot; was removed from the Fox schedule due to lackluster ratings. The series was replaced on the network&#x27;s schedule with reruns of &quot;Totally Outrageous Behavior&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Craziest Videos&quot;. Fox claimed that it intended to air the series&#x27; five remaining episodes at some point during the summer season. However, on May 21, 2004, Fox&#x27;s entertainment president Gail Berman announced that the series was cancelled; she claimed that the network would provide &quot;any viewer that needs the information with the information of the conclusion.&quot; Two months later, Fox posted synopses of the unaired episodes on its website, in which it was revealed that the final suitor selected by Jackie was a straight man and thus they both split the $1 million reward.

On January 17, 2005, Fox published the entire series on their website, in which users could download the individual episodes on a pay-per-view basis. Despite the network&#x27;s claimed reason, Jackie disputed the reason for the series&#x27; cancellation. She stated: &quot;I can’t say it was cancelled due to ratings. It aired on Fridays, and no shows have been successful on Fridays ... [Fox] blamed it on the ratings, but I think it may have been something deeper.&quot;

The mid-season cancellation of &quot;Playing It Straight&quot; had an impact on other LGBT-related programming. &quot;Seriously, Dude, I&#x27;m Gay&quot;, another Fox produced LGBT-related reality television special, was set to air on June 7, 2004, although it was abruptly removed from the Fox schedule only eleven days before its airdate. An &quot;insider&quot; at Fox claimed that the underperformance of &quot;Playing It Straight&quot; was a significant factor in the special&#x27;s cancellation, as it caused the network to &quot;believe the gay reality phenomenon was on the wane.&quot; The producers of the TBS series &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; viewed &quot;Playing It Straight&quot;—in addition to &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; and &quot;Seriously, Dude, I&#x27;m Gay&quot;—as an example of the &quot;potential pitfalls&quot; to avoid when producing an LGBT-themed show. The underperformance and cancellations of these series resulted in executive producers Douglas Ross and Tommy Campbell consulting GLAAD for review of &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Adaptations of the series premiered in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, an adaptation titled &quot;Herken de Homo&quot; (Dutch; the English title is &quot;Recognize the Gay&quot;) premiered on January 4, 2005, on RTL 5. The series, which was hosted by Dutch television presenter Fiona Hering, was broadcast for a single season. Filmed in Mexico, the series followed Nathalie Biermanns, a 23-year-old actor, as she competed for a €50,000 (US$55,229). She had to choose between 14 men. At the end, only Marcel remained who turned out to be straight. Both Biermanns and Marcel won €50,000 (US$55,229) each.

An Australian version of the show aired on the Seven Network starting October 2004 hosted by Natalie Garonzi. Despite much of the hype surrounding it the shows ratings dwindled and it was moved to a later timeslot. After Rebecca eliminated Campbell (who was gay) Chad, Dane and Evan were left for one non-elimination round before appearing in the final episode. Rebecca chose Chad and he was revealed to be straight.

The Australian show has also aired in the US on FOX Reality.

The series was adapted for the United Kingdom, in which it aired for two seasons. The first season premiered on April 8, 2005, as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;Twisted Dating Season&quot;. The series was set on a Mexican ranch and Zoe Hardman is spending time with 12 men. Ten men started the show and two more, Lee and Marco, were added in week 3 - it was revealed when they arrived that one was gay and one was straight. The prize money was £100,000 and the show was hosted by June Sarpong. The series has been repeated on Channel 4&#x27;s sister channel, 4Music.

Early reporting revealed Ben Harris to be Mr Gay UK and also said: &quot;Ben Harris, a builder, looks to be one of the favourites to win the show after the first episode in which he played to the builder stereotype.&quot;

In October 2011, it was announced that Channel 4 had ordered a full second series. This time the location was set in Spain and the new series was hosted by T4 presenter, Jameela Jamil and comedian Alan Carr provided the narration. The prize fund was decreased 50% to £50,000 (£25,000 each). The second series made its debut on 9 January 2012 at 9pm on E4. The series was set at a Spanish hacienda - Hacienda de los Hombres. The series was also aired on Channel 4&#x27;s teen-strand, T4 on Saturdays.

<text>Joseph Will Oldham (born January 15, 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and actor. From 1993 to 1997, he performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under variations of Palace (Palace, Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, and Palace Music). After briefly publishing music under his own name, in 1998 he adopted Bonnie &quot;Prince&quot; Billy as the name for most of his work.

==Early life and education==
Oldham was born on January 15, 1970, in Louisville, Kentucky. His mother, Joanne Lei Will Tafel Oldham, was a teacher and artist. His father, Joseph Collins Oldham, was an attorney and photographer. Oldham graduated from the J. Graham Brown School in 1988. He attended Brown University sporadically while pursuing a career as an actor, and living between Brooklyn, Los Angeles, and Bloomington, Indiana. He began making music during this time, initially as a project for his professor Jeff Todd Titon, an ethnomusicologist at Brown University.

== Career ==

Oldham is known for his &quot;do-it-yourself punk aesthetic and blunt honesty&quot;, and his music has been likened to Americana, folk, roots, country, punk, and indie rock. He has been called an &quot;Appalachian post-punk solipsist&quot;, with a voice that has been described as &quot;a fragile sort-of warble frittering around haunted melodies in the American folk or country tradition.&quot;

Oldham first performed and recorded under various permutations of the Palace name, including Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, Palace Music, and simply Palace. Regarding the name changes during this period (1993–1997), Oldham said:
Will stated in a 1995 interview with KCRW that the name Palace Flophouse was inspired by reading John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. Beginning in 1998, Oldham has primarily used the moniker Bonnie &#x27;Prince&#x27; Billy, which draws inspiration from several sources:
He has explained that &quot;the primary purpose of the pseudonym is to allow both the audience and the performer to have a relationship with the performer that is valid and unbreakable.&quot;

===Critical reception===
Some of his albums, such as &quot;There Is No-One What Will Take Care of You&quot; (1993), &quot;Viva Last Blues&quot; (1995), and &quot;I See a Darkness&quot; (1999), have appeared on greatest albums lists.
Johnny Cash recorded a version of &quot;I See a Darkness&quot; on his American Recordings disc &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot; (2000). Oldham provided backing vocals. Spanish singer Rosalía also recorded a version of &quot;I See a Darkness&quot; for her debut album &quot;Los Ángeles&quot;. Marianne Faithfull included Oldham&#x27;s &quot;A King at Night&quot; on her 2003 &quot;Kissin Time&quot; tour. Steve Adey also covered &quot;I See a Darkness&quot; on his 2006 LP &quot;All Things Real&quot;. Mark Kozelek recorded a version of Oldham&#x27;s &quot;New Partner&quot; on his 2008 disc, &quot;The Finally LP&quot;. Katatonia covered &quot;Oh How I Enjoy the Light&quot; on their 2001 EP &quot;Tonight&#x27;s Music&quot;, and their song &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot; is about and contains an interpolation of the Palace Brothers song &quot;You Will Miss Me When I Burn&quot;. In 2009 Mark Lanegan and Soulsavers recorded a cover version of &quot;You Will Miss Me When I Burn&quot;. The release is a split single, backed with the Lanegan-penned &quot;Sunrise&quot; featuring vocals by Oldham. In 2011, Deer Tick&#x27;s cover of Oldham&#x27;s song &quot;Death to Everyone&quot; appeared in an episode of &quot;Hell On Wheels&quot;. Cadaverous Condition covered &quot;Black&quot; on their &quot;To the Night Sky&quot; album (2006).

===Acting===
====Film and television====
Oldham&#x27;s first film acting role was as the teen preacher in John Sayles&#x27;s film &quot;Matewan&quot; (1987), a dramatization of the life of Appalachian mining community in the 1920s and the Battle of Matewan. Following this, he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as an actor. He played the role of Chip McClure (father of Baby Jessica) in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure&quot; (1989), and the role of Miles in the film &quot;Thousand Pieces of Gold&quot; (1991). Oldham also played minor roles in &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; (1999), &quot;Junebug&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Guatemalan Handshake&quot; (2006).

In 2004, Oldham appeared as himself in the short documentary film &quot;Tripping With Caveh&quot;, wherein he took psilocybin mushrooms with autobiographical filmmaker Caveh Zahedi. The project was intended as the pilot episode of a reality/documentary series, with the concept being that Zahedi would take psychedelics in the company of a different celebrity in each episode. The project was never picked up by a television network, but the short with Oldham finally saw official release in the 2015 retrospective box set &quot;Digging My Own Grave: The Films of Caveh Zahedi&quot;.

Oldham played a lead role as Kurt in Kelly Reichardt&#x27;s film &quot;Old Joy&quot; (2006), and had a brief role in the director&#x27;s next film &quot;Wendy and Lucy&quot; (2008). Oldham played Pastor Pigmeat in the &quot;Horse Apples&quot; episode of the second season of the MTV children&#x27;s show parody &quot;Wonder Showzen&quot; and appeared in an episode of Chatman and Lee&#x27;s subsequent television show, &quot;&quot; as a Reverend. In 2007, he starred alongside Zach Galifianakis in a music video for Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Tell Me Nothing&quot;.

Also in 2010, Oldham appeared in &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; as a gorilla trainer. As part of an agreement to play that role, he wrote a theme song, in the style of a Saturday-morning cartoon show, for filmmaker Lance Bangs.

In 2011, Oldham played a father telling a bedtime story to his son in David Lowery&#x27;s short film &quot;Pioneer&quot;. In 2017, he appeared as &quot;Prognosticator&quot; in the feature film &quot;A Ghost Story&quot;, also directed by David Lowery.

====Voice work====
In 2009, Oldham narrated &quot;Madam and Little Boy&quot;, a documentary film about atomic weapons, directed by Swedish artist Magnus Bärtås. In 2010, Oldham narrated &quot;Music Makes a City&quot;, a documentary about the formation of the Louisville Orchestra, directed by Owsley Brown III and Jerome Hiler. Oldham provided voice work and inspiration for the character &quot;Will&quot; in the video game &quot;Kentucky Route Zero&quot;, released in 2013.

== Personal life ==
Oldham married the textile artist Elsa Hansen in 2016. They had a child together in 2018.

<text>The American Conservative (TAC) is a bimonthly magazine published by the American Ideas Institute. The magazine was founded in 2002 by Pat Buchanan, Scott McConnell and Taki Theodoracopulos to advance an anti-neoconservative perspective. It has been noted as the only conservative publication in the early 2000s to oppose the Iraq War, publishing a string of articles Ralph Nader described as &quot;the most devastating critiques of the neocons&#x27; lust for unlawful wars&quot; of the era. It was later credited with putting J.D. Vance&#x27;s &quot;Hillbilly Ellegy&quot; &quot;on the map&quot; in a 2016 interview with Vance. 

According to the publication, it exists to promote a form of conservatism that opposes unchecked power in government and business, supports &quot;vibrant markets and free people&quot;, and embraces &quot;realism and restraint&quot; in foreign policy. 

== History ==

&quot;The American Conservative&quot; was founded by Pat Buchanan, Scott McConnell and Taki Theodoracopulos in October 2002. The magazine took a paleoconservative character, aiming to counter the neoconservative positions of the &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. It was critical of the Bush administration and in particular of its invasion of Iraq. According to the publication, it exists to promote a conservatism that opposes unchecked power in government and business, promotes the concept of the nuclear family, free markets, and supports realism and restraint in foreign affairs based on America&#x27;s national interests.

In the first issue, dated 7 October 2002, the editorial by Buchanan and Taki stated that the new publication aimed &quot;to ignite the conversations that conservatives ought to have engaged in since the end of the Cold War, but didn&#x27;t.&quot; It continued that much of what then passed for conservatism was &quot;wedded to a kind of radicalism – fantasies of global hegemony, the hubristic notion of America as a universal nation for all the world&#x27;s peoples, a hyperglobal economy.&quot; In the same issue, an article by Buchanan challenged the Iraq War, asking &quot;What comes after all the celebratory gunfire when wicked Saddam is dead?&quot; and the magazine has been credited as the only conservative publication to oppose the war.

Until early 2005, Buchanan and Taki served as the magazine&#x27;s editors, with McConnell as executive editor, while Taki was its publisher. Kara Hopkins was the next executive editor.

In its early years, the magazine called for an amendment to the US Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.

Before the 2006 midterm elections, &quot;The American Conservative&quot; urged its readers to vote for Democrats: &quot;It should surprise few readers that we think a vote that is seen—in America and the world at large—as a decisive &#x27;No&#x27; vote on the Bush presidency is the best outcome&quot;.

Buchanan and Taki retired as editors, and Taki as publisher, in 2005, although Buchanan continued to write for it. Ron Unz was the publisher in 2007. 

In 2010, Daniel McCarthy succeeded Hopkins as editor. In September 2011, the magazine introduced an editorial redesign of its print publication and in May 2012 a redesign of its website. In October 2014, Benjamin Schwarz, the former national and literary editor of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, was named national editor of the magazine.

In November 2016, Robert W. Merry succeeded McCarthy as editor, with Lewis McCrary and Kelley Beaucar Vlahos as Executive Editors. After Merry&#x27;s retirement in July 2018, W. James Antle III was named editor.

In April 2020, Johnny Burtka, executive director and acting editor of &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, said that the publication&#x27;s ambition is to &quot;become &quot;The Atlantic&quot; of the right&quot; and said its online page views had &quot;grown significantly&quot; under the Trump administration.

&quot;The American Conservative&quot; is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025.

===Publication===
Originally published semi-monthly, it was reduced to a monthly publication in August 2009 and, in 2013, a bimonthly publication.

==Impact==
Largely reviled by many American conservatives following its founding due to its pacifist and iconoclastic positions, the magazine spent its early history, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, as &quot;an unheeded voice in the face of indifferent or hostile elite opinion&quot;. In subsequent years, the publication evolved into what Matthew Continetti described as a &quot;durable platform for the anti-war right&quot; and, by 2023, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported that over &quot;the last seven years, the Republican Party has grown to embody just about everything &quot;The American Conservative&quot; has ever wanted&quot;.

===Influence===
In July 2016, J.D. Vance gave an interview to the &quot;The American Conservative&quot; about his book &quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot;, which was later credited by the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; Jennifer Senior with launching the volume&#x27;s success and putting it &quot;on the map&quot;.

=== Reception ===
In 2004, Peter Carlson wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that for scathing attacks on Bush and the invasion of Iraq, &quot;The American Conservative&quot; might have the edge over &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, and &quot;The Progressive&quot;.

In 2009, Reihan Salam, &quot;National Review&quot; editor, wrote that the publication had &quot;gained a devoted following as a sharp &quot;critic&quot; of the conservative mainstream&quot;.

In 2012, David Brooks, columnist at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called &quot;The American Conservative&quot; &quot;one of the more dynamic spots on the political Web&quot; and said its &quot;writers like Rod Dreher and Daniel Larison tend to be suspicious of bigness: big corporations, big government, a big military, concentrated power and concentrated wealth.&quot;

In 2014, Ralph Nader credited &quot;The American Conservative&quot; with demonstrating &quot;the possibility of Left-Right fusion&quot; and attributed to it &quot;the most devastating critiques of the neocons&#x27; lust for unlawful wars&quot;. According to Nader, &quot;&quot;The Nation&quot; magazine could easily carry most of its articles without skipping a paragraph&quot;.

<doc id="528034" wikidata="Q3266045" url="?curid=528034" title="Ludger Duvernay">
<text>Ludger Duvernay (January 22, 1799 – November 28, 1852), born in Verchères, Quebec, was a printer by profession and published a number of newspapers including the &quot;Gazette des Trois-Rivières,&quot; the first newspaper in Lower Canada outside of Quebec City and Montreal, and also &quot;La Minerve&quot;, which supported the and Louis-Joseph Papineau in the years leading up to the Lower Canada Rebellion.

==Biography==
Duvernay was one of several journalists imprisoned early in 1832 for criticizing the non-elected legislative council that represented the interests of the Château Clique. Duvernay, editor of &quot;La Minerve&quot; and Daniel Tracey, another editor of the English language &quot;The Vindicator&quot; newspaper were arrested for libel and imprisoned together for 40 days for writing articles that said that &quot;it is certain that before long all of America must be republican.&quot; They were released after much public support and condemnation of the arrests. He was arrested by the authorities on four separate occasions.

On April 5, 1836, he fought in a duel with Clément-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury, which ended with him being shot in the right knee.

On June 9, 1834, Duvernay founded the &quot;Association Saint-Jean-Baptiste&quot; (today, the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste and designated June 24 a day of celebration of &quot;Canadien&quot; history and culture. The society was previously known as the Société &quot;Aide-toi et le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot; (&quot;help yourself and Heaven will help you&quot;), founded by Duvernay on March 8, 1834.

Duvernay was briefly a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada representing Lachenaie in 1837. When on November 16 Governor Gosford issued warrants for the arrest of 26 patriot leaders, Duvernay was on the list. He had however been warned that his arrest was imminent and fled in time to Burlington, Vermont.

He returned to Montreal in 1842 to resume publication of a more moderate &quot;La Minerve,&quot; which was at first sympathetic to Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and then later, George-Étienne Cartier.

In 1922, June 24 became a public holiday in Quebec, and since 1977 it has been the national holiday of Quebec.

On his death in Montreal in 1852, 10,000 people attended his funeral. Duvernay was interred in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges.

<text>BioRubyis a collection of open-source Ruby code, comprising classes for computational molecular biology and bioinformatics. It contains classes for DNA and protein sequence analysis, sequence alignment, biological database parsing, structural biology and other bioinformatics tasks. BioRuby is released under the GNU GPL version 2 or Ruby licence and is one of a number of Bio* projects, designed to reduce code duplication.

In 2011, the BioRuby project introduced the Biogem software plugin system, with two or three new plugins added every month.

BioRuby is managed via the BioRuby website and GitHub repository.

==History==

===BioRuby===
The BioRuby project was first started in 2000 by Toshiaki Katayama as a Ruby implementation of similar bioinformatics packages such as BioPerl and BioPython. The initial release of version 0.1 was frequently updated by contributors both informally and at organised “hackathon” events; in June 2005, BioRuby was funded by IPA as an Exploratory Software Project, culminating with the release of version 1.0.0 in February 2006. Between 2009 and 2012, BioRuby was the focus of a number of Google Summer of Code projects to improve the codebase. BioRuby Version 2.0.0 was released in 2019.

== Biogem ==
Biogem provides a set of tools for bioinformaticians who want to code an application or library that uses or extends BioRuby&#x27;s core library, as well as share the code as a gem on rubygems.org. Any gem published via the Biogem framework is also listed at biogems.info.

The aim of Biogem is to promote a modular approach to the BioRuby package and simplify the creation of modules by automating process of setting up directory/file scaffolding, a git repository and releasing online package databases.

<doc id="528041" wikidata="Q1225001" url="?curid=528041" title="Coquina">
<text>Coquina () is a sedimentary rock that is composed either wholly or almost entirely of the transported, abraded, and mechanically sorted fragments of mollusks, trilobites, brachiopods, or other invertebrates. The term &quot;coquina&quot; comes from the Spanish word for &quot;cockle&quot; and &quot;shellfish&quot;.

For a sediment to be considered to be a coquina, the particles composing it should average or greater in size. Coquina can vary in hardness from poorly to moderately cemented. Incompletely consolidated and poorly cemented coquinas are considered grainstones in the Dunham classification system for carbonate sedimentary rocks. A well-cemented coquina is classified as a biosparite (fossiliferous limestone) according to the Folk classification of sedimentary rocks.

Coquinas accumulate in high-energy marine and lacustrine environments where currents and waves result in the vigorous winnowing, abrasion, fracturing, and sorting of the shells that compose them. As a result, they typically exhibit well-developed bedding or cross-bedding, close packing, and good orientation of the shell fragments. The high-energy marine or lacustrine environments associated with coquinas include beaches, shallow submarine raised banks, swift tidal channels, and barrier bars.

==Composition and distribution==

Coquina is composed mainly of the mineral calcite, often including some phosphate, in the form of seashells or coral. Coquinas dating from the Devonian period through to the much more recent Pleistocene epoch are a common find all over the world, with the depositional requirements to form a coquina being a common thing in many marine facies.

==History and use==

===Australia===
Adjacent to Shark Bay Road beginning southeast of Denham is an approximately long stretch of coastline composed of billions of tiny shells of the Shark Bay cockle (Fragum erugatum), averaging less than in length. The shell deposit, between thick, has compacted and cemented in some areas into solid masses of limestone that formerly was quarried and cut into blocks used in local construction.

St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church, the Old Pearler Restaurant, and parts of the Shark Bay Hotel in Shark Bay were built from coquina shell blocks. The church, built in 1954, has walls infilled with coquina shell blocks between a light steel frame and a shell facing, while the Old Pearler was built in 1974–1977 with buttressed coquina shell block walls.

===Brazil===

Recently discovered petroleum-bearing formations off the coast of northeastern Brazil hold coquina reservoirs of oil. The coquinas are generally heterogeneous in their porosity and permeability, but like other lacustrine carbonates, they are uncommonly reservoirs. Corbett et al. (2015) in their discussion of the reservoirs say the finding of the Badejo Field (Campos Basin) in 1975 was the first hydrocarbon discovery in the coquinas of the Lagoa Feia, followed by that of the Pampo and Linguado Fields in 1978. The coquinas of the Morro do Chaves Formation were formed by non-marine bivalves and ostracods. The shells of the bivalves, which lived in shallow oxygenated water, were transported and deposited as washout over stream fans and beaches by storms and long-shore drift.

The palynological record of coquinas of the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin has been analyzed and the sediments dated to the late Barremian age; the results suggest a marine and/or brackish environment. Daniel Thompson (2013) asserts that the coquinas of the Morro do Chaves Formation include a wide range of marine mollusca characteristic of brackish environmental conditions, suggesting periodic marine ingression during the Early Cretaceous.

According to a paper by Senira Kattah published in &quot;The Sedimentary Record&quot;, the discovery of the Lula Field by Petrobras and partners in 2006 opened petroleum exploration in the Barremian/Aptian pre-salt play in the offshore Santos and Campos basins, and consequently deeper coquina reservoirs have become important targets. He says the two main reservoir targets recognized for the pre-salt within the study areas are: &quot;late rift coquinas, lacustrine facies deposited at the Late Barremian to Early Aptian, and the younger rift/sag microbial limestones deposited during the Aptian, just before the establishment of the major evaporitic sag basin between South America and Africa.&quot; There are abundant beds of coquina in the Outer High of the Santos Basin, similar to those from the neighboring Campos. Pre-salt stratigraphy of the Santos Basin shows lacustrine sediments composed of coarse pelecypod (bivalve) coquina during the Barremian and Aptian sag phase of the continental crust subsidence.

===Florida===

Coquina deposits in Florida occur mostly along the eastern coast of the peninsula. This coquina is named the Anastasia Formation after Anastasia Island, where the Spanish quarried the rock to construct the Castillo de San Marcos, the fortress they built to defend St. Augustine. The Anastasia Formation stretches from just north of St. Augustine in St. Johns County to southern Palm Beach County. The formation and associated sand form part of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, a Pleistocene barrier island chain that extends from Duval County to Dade County. Other coquina deposits are found in the state, but only in limited areas. The Anastasia Formation is naturally exposed in a number of places along the east coast including Washington Oaks Gardens State Park, Gilbert&#x27;s Bar House of Refuge, Hutchinson Island in Martin County and Blowing Rocks Preserve, owned by The Nature Conservancy, in Martin County.
Still occasionally quarried or mined, and used as a building stone in Florida for over 400 years, coquina forms the walls of the Castillo in St. Augustine. The stone made a very good material for building forts, particularly those built during the period of heavy cannon use. Because of coquina&#x27;s softness, cannonballs would sink into, rather than shatter or puncture the walls. The first Saint Augustine lighthouse, built by the Spanish, was also made of coquina.
Coquina was used as building stone in St. Augustine as early as 1598 for construction of a powder house. This was the beginning of a building tradition that extended into the 1930s along Florida&#x27;s Atlantic Coast. In the St. Augustine vicinity, the Castillo de San Marcos, Fort Matanzas, the old city gates, the Cathedral, Spanish and British Period residential structures, property line walls and tombs were constructed of coquina quarried on Anastasia Island. To the south in New Smyrna, a large storehouse and wharf were constructed of coquina at the 1770s Andrew Turnbull colony. Around 1816, John Addison constructed a kitchen house of coquina on his plantation on the Tomoka River. The material was also used in the construction of sugar mill buildings on sugar plantations in the 1820s and 1830s. Examples are the Bulow, Dunlawton and New Smyrna sugar mills. In these early structures, the porous coquina was protected by lime plaster. With the exception of a few residences that have been restored in St. Augustine, the coquina masonry of these structures is today exposed to the elements and is slowly deteriorating.

===Mexico===

Overlying the fossiliferous sands and sandy clays of the upper San Fernando River in northeastern Mexico is a bed of coquina limestone dating probably to the Cenozoic era. Coquina deposits also occur in the Baja California peninsula, including submerged &quot;reefs&quot;. So-called coquina &quot;reefs&quot; occur at Punta Borrascosa, San Felipe and Coloraditos on the northeast coast of Baja California. These have been uranium-thorium dated to the Pleistocene epoch, with an age estimated at 130,000 ybp. Semi-continuous coquina outcrops have been found east of Puerto Peñasco, in the shallow subtidal zone or partly submerged under intertidal sands.

Other Pleistocene outcrops occur along both coastlines of the upper Gulf of California. On the Vizcaino Peninsula of western Baja California, the informally named &quot;Tivela stultorum&quot; coquina is abundant in shells of the Pismo clam. Until analysis of the shells by U-series and amino-acids methods is concluded, this marine transgression is assigned an approximate age of 200,000 ybp. Outcrops in Bahía de San Hipolito and Bahía de Asunción are loosely consolidated, sandy beachrock a few meters thick, found above present mean sea level.

The ancient Maya built their city of Toniná in the highlands of what is now Chiapas in southern Mexico using native rocks to construct its masonry buildings, among them large coquina flagstones from which they made blocks and bricks for floors, walls, and stairways.

===North Carolina===
Coquina has a very limited distribution in southeastern North Carolina. The best known outcrop is located in New Hanover County, near Fort Fisher, along the southern tip of North Carolina&#x27;s coast. It is one of the few naturally occurring outcrops in the coastal plain region of North Carolina, described as “a low-relief plain underlain by beds of shallow-marine, estuarine, shoreline, and fluvial sediments&quot; in &quot;The Geology of the Carolinas&quot;. These sediments were deposited during numerous episodes of sea level rise and fall over hundreds of thousands of years. The coastlines of the Tidewater region of North Carolina change constantly in response to wind and wave action, sedimentary deposition, tidal movements, and changes in sea level. Although the inner coastal plain is considered to be more stable, the coastal plain was inundated by repeated marine transgressions due to fluctuating sea levels during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene.

Historical records and extant buildings, foundations, basements, and retaining walls indicate that coquina was being mined in North Carolina by at least 1760, evidenced by the extant architectural ruins at the colonial-era Clear Springs Plantation near New Bern.

Sedgeley Abbey, an 18th-century plantation house on the lower Cape Fear River was built of locally quarried coquina. The house that once stood on a vast tract of land directly across the river from Orton was described by local historian and author James Sprunt as &quot;the grandest colonial residence of the Cape Fear&quot;. Sprunt compared Sedgeley Abbey in dimensions and appearance to the two-story, cellared, Governor Dudley mansion that still stands in Wilmington. Like many southern plantations, Sedgeley Abbey was abandoned after the Civil War. The vacant house was demolished in the 1870s and the coquina rubble was burned and spread on the fields as fertilizer. A cellar eight feet deep carved into solid coquina was located during archaeological investigations on the site of the former plantation in 1978.

==Other uses==
In the past coquina was used for the construction of buildings in Denham, Western Australia, but quarrying is no longer permitted in the World Heritage Site.

When first quarried, coquina is extremely soft. This softness makes it very easy to remove from the quarry and cut into shape. However, the stone is also at first much too soft to be used for building. In order to be used as a building material, the stone is left out to dry for approximately one to three years, which causes the stone to harden into a usable, but still comparatively soft, form.

Coquina has also been used as a source of paving material. It is usually poorly cemented and easily breaks into component shell or coral fragments, which can be substituted for gravel or crushed harder rocks. In the 1930s, large-scale mining of coquina for use in highway construction began at Fort Fisher in North Carolina. Large pieces of coquina of unusual shape are sometimes used as landscape decoration.

Because coquina often includes a component of phosphate, it is sometimes mined for use as fertilizer.

<doc id="528046" wikidata="Q1442656" url="?curid=528046" title="John Butler Trio">
<text>The John Butler Trio were an Australian roots-rock band led by guitarist and vocalist John Butler, an APRA and ARIA-award-winning musician. They formed in Fremantle in 1998 with Jason McGann on drums, Gavin Shoesmith on bass and John Butler on vocals. By 2009, the trio consisted of Butler with Byron Luiters on bass and Nicky Bomba on drums and percussion, the latter being replaced by Grant Gerathy in 2013. After both Luiters and Gerathy exited the trio in early 2019, bassist OJ Newcomb and drummer Terepai Richmond (also of The Whitlams) joined the band, accompanied by touring musician Elana Stone on keyboards, percussion and backing vocals.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Three&quot; (2001) reached the top 30 in the Australian album charts and achieved platinum sales. The band&#x27;s subsequent studio albums: &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot; (2004); &quot;Grand National&quot; (2007); and &quot;April Uprising&quot; (2010) all debuted at the number one position on the Australian album charts, with all three albums reaching platinum sales status. &quot;Living 2001–2002&quot; (2003), the band&#x27;s first live album, reached the top ten and also achieved platinum status in Australia. The band&#x27;s second live album, &quot;Live at St. Gallen&quot; (2005), also achieved gold record status. The band&#x27;s releases since 2002 have been marketed independently by Jarrah Records, which Butler co-owns with West Australian folk band the Waifs and manager of both acts, Philip Stevens. Their final studio album, &quot;Home&quot;, was released in 2018.

== History ==
===Early career===
The John Butler Trio is fronted by John Butler on vocals and guitars. He started his career as a busker in Fremantle, Western Australia and released a self-recorded cassette, &quot;Searching for Heritage&quot; in 1996. Gavin Shoesmith on double bass and bass guitar founded Katamaran in Darwin with Mark Hoffman on didgeridoo and Grant Smith on percussion. With Butler, Shoesmith and Jason McGann on drums, John Butler Trio was formed in Fremantle in 1998 and independently released the &quot;John Butler&quot; album in December. It was produced by Butler and included re-recorded versions of two tracks from his &quot;Searching for Heritage&quot;.

The trio toured throughout Western Australia in 1999, then The Waifs invited Butler to perform solo on their Australian tour – he also performed his own gigs. The John Butler Trio then launched their own tour where Butler met his future wife Danielle Caruana in Broome.

The John Butler Trio released the four-track extended play, &quot;JBT&quot;, in April 2000 with songs short enough to win radio play. It was produced by Butler and Shaun O&#x27;Callaghan. Radio station Triple J chose the track &quot;Pickapart&quot; to put on high rotation. The band began to develop a wider reputation with a performance at the East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival in Byron Bay in 2000. Butler recalled that his first gig had about 50 people, the second gig started the same way when &quot;it absolutely pissed with rain and 3000 people ran into our tent. And the show just went berserk. It was like a suffocated fire – you lift the lid and it explodes&quot;. The John Butler Trio has become a regular artist at the annual event.

===&quot;Three&quot;===
In April 2001, John Butler Trio released &quot;Three&quot; and relocated to Melbourne to promote the record on the east coast. The track, &quot;Betterman&quot;, was on high rotation by Triple J. &quot;Three&quot; peaked at No. 24 on the ARIA Charts. It also remained on the alternative charts for nine months reaching No. 3. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 the album won an award for &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27;. &quot;Betterman&quot; reached No. 5 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2001.

Shoesmith left the trio to form his own band, The Groovesmiths, Butler replaced him with 19-year-old Rory Quirk, who was on their first tour of the United States in 2001. Quirk, in turn, left in 2002 to pursue a career with his band, Quirk. Andrew Fry joined as the next bass player.

The success of &quot;Three&quot; led to its release in the US in 2002 and two tours of the US followed. The band supported the Dave Matthews Band and John Mayer as well as playing at the Bonnaroo Music Festival and the South by Southwest Festival. The band also played at the Splendour in the Grass Festival in Australia. Butler, his manager Phil Stevens and fellow Western Australian folk artists, The Waifs, founded Jarrah Records in July 2002.

As a result of intensive touring, the band developed a great live reputation in Australia. The band released &quot;Living 2001-2002&quot; in February 2003, a double live album which had a top ten debut in the ARIA album charts and went on to achieve platinum sales. Butler took a brief break after five years of solid work since 1997 for the birth of his daughter Banjo.

=== &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot; ===
In late 2003, John Butler entered Woodstock Studios in Melbourne owned by Joe Camilleri, the leader of Jo Jo Zep and the Black Sorrows. He had a new band consisting of percussionist Nicky Bomba and upright-bass player Shannon Birchall. After recording the album, Bomba returned to his own reggae band and was replaced by drummer/percussionist Michael Barker.

John Butler told the Australian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; released in April 2004 that he wanted greater freedom to pursue his vision. &quot;Essentially what I learnt out of this process was, more so than ever, I&#x27;m the keeper of the music. I have the intuition and the foresight to pick the right players to my music. I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s not always about having the same players for five, six or 10 years, it&#x27;s having the right chemistry for these songs at this time. Some of my favourite Jimi Hendrix music is off-the-cuff stuff with Band of Gypsies.&quot;

The title &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot; is taken from the lyrics to the second track, Peaches and Cream. The album debuted at number one in the national album charts on 15 March 2004 and achieved gold record status in its first week of release.

The &quot;Zebra&quot; EP was released in December 2003 and made the ARIA singles charts in early 2004. The song was voted No. 7 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2004 and also was the first John Butler Trio single to gain significant airplay on commercial FM radio across Australia, although it was still quite popular on Triple J.
John Butler would win an Australasian Performing Right Association award for Song of the Year in March 2004. On 20 October 2006, the track also appeared as the opening music for the episode &#x27;Traffic&#x27; (Season 3, Episode 5) of the popular US Crime drama Numb3rs.

In 2005 John Butler and co-founder Danielle Caruana (his wife) inaugurated the JB Seed grant program. &quot;The Seed aims to help Australian artists from any background, creating art and music across any genre, to establish themselves as self-sustained, professional artists.&quot; Caruana also plays independent music, she plays under the name Mama Kin.

Following the Boxing Day Tsunami, the John Butler Trio appeared at the Wave Aid fundraising concert in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in disaster affected areas.

The John Butler Trio played at all venues for the Big Day Out music festival, starting in Auckland, New Zealand on 19 January 2007, and finishing in Perth Western Australia on 4 February.

=== &quot;Grand National&quot; ===
Their fourth studio album, entitled &quot;Grand National&quot;, was released on 24 March 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, and released on 27 March 2007 in the United States and France. The first single off the album, titled &quot;Funky Tonight&quot;, reached a high of No. 15 on the ARIA charts and No. 12 on Triple J Hottest 100 for 2006. A second single, &quot;Better Than,&quot; was also released. In conjunction with the American release, the trio scheduled a small American Tour consisting of five cities starting in Los Angeles and ending in New York.

In April 2007 &quot;Grand National&quot; was the initial album nominated for a J Award by national youth broadcaster Triple J. &quot;Better Than&quot; which was released as the first overseas single from &quot;Grand National&quot;, reached No. 1 on the Triple A format charts in United States in June 2007. It also reached the top ten international songs at Japanese Radio and has been a major radio hit in France where the video made MTV&#x27;s video of the week.

On 7 July 2007 they performed at the Australian leg of Live Earth in Sydney. On 31 July 2007 the John Butler Trio performed their song, &quot;Better Than&quot; on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. On 4 August 2007 they performed at Newport Folk Festival playing a set that included &quot;Used to Get High&quot;, &quot;Better Than&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot;, &quot;Funky Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Good Excuse&quot;.

In 2007, the John Butler Trio won the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for &quot;Best Performing Independent Album&quot; as well as &quot;Best Independent Release&quot; and &quot;Best Blues and Roots Album&quot; at the ARIA Awards.

On 3 August 2008 they performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago. The John Butler Trio concluded the summer of 2008 touring the U.S. with G. Love and Special Sauce.

In July 2009 &quot;Betterman&quot; was voted number 47 by the Australian public in Triple J Hottest 100 of all time.

On 26 March 2009 John Butler announced that the current bass and drum musicians of the John Butler Trio, Shannon Birchall and Michael Barker are separating from the band. For purely artistic reasons, John feels that it is necessary to change the line up in an attempt by John to discover new inspirations with new members. John stated in his announcement; 

Michael Barker went on to form Swamp Thing with guitarist/singer Grant Haua, based in New Zealand. Their first album &quot;Balladeer&quot; was released in May 2011.

=== &quot;April Uprising&quot; ===
On 30 June 2009 John Butler announced the new bass and drum musicians of the John Butler Trio to be Byron Luiters as the bassist and Nicky Bomba as the drummer and percussionist. Bomba, Butler&#x27;s brother-in-law, had previously been a member of the John Butler Trio.

The new line-up has spent the last few months in a studio in Fremantle, recording the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, which was released 26 March 2010. The album will be called &quot;April Uprising&quot;, named after Butler&#x27;s voyage to find his ancestors on SBS Television&#x27;s genealogy series, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. The recording process for the new album has been shared with fans via a special studio sessions page on the band&#x27;s website. The first single from the album, &quot;One Way Road&quot;, was released on 4 December 2009. Butler described the song as being 

The band, according to billboard.com, recorded twenty two songs at Butler&#x27;s home based studio in Fremantle, this was eventually cut down to the fifteen that appear on the album. The album was released in Australia, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and The Netherlands on 26 March 2010, in New Zealand and France on 29 March, in the UK on 5 April, and in the USA / Canada on 6 April.

&quot;April Uprising&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA albums chart on 5 April and whilst the first two singles from the album, &quot;One Way Road&quot; and &quot;Close to You&quot;, charted at No. 15 and No. 36 on the Australian ARIA singles charts they both reached the top five in the Spins radio airplay charts, the former reaching No. 1.

On 4 June 2010 John Butler Trio played a show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, which was streamed live to fans around the world at Livestream.

In 2010, the John Butler Trio received the award for &quot;Most Popular Independent Artist&quot; at the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Awards while &quot;April Uprising&quot; was nominated at the ARIA Awards for &#x27;Best Blues and Roots Album&#x27; and &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27;.

In February 2012, John Butler recorded a studio version of the Trio&#x27;s instrumental single &quot;Ocean&quot;, at &quot;The Compound&quot; in Fremantle, and uploaded it to the band&#x27;s YouTube channel later in that year. The 12-minute video clip went viral, and has accumulated over 35 million views online.

On 31 August 2013, it was announced by John Butler that Nicky Bomba (drums and percussion) will be leaving the band. Subsequently, on 8 October, Butler announced that Grant Gerathy of &quot;Ray Mann Three&quot; will be the new drummer for the Trio.

===&quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;===
&quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;, produced by Jan Skubiszewski, was released on 7 February 2014, with the initial single &quot;Only One&quot; released on 15 November 2013. While the single ranked 87th in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2013, the album itself received the 2014 ARIA Award for Best Blues and Roots Album, debuted at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and reached No. 7 in the Hungarian charts. The trio also undertook a large national tour in February and March 2014 to support the release of the new album.

Singles from &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; were performed by the Trio on the American late-night talk show &quot;Conan&quot; on 24 February 2014, and for Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Like a Version&quot; on 11 April 2014. Their roots rock cover of Pharrell Williams&#x27; &quot;Happy&quot; features on the CD and DVD releases of &quot;Like a Version&quot;&#x27;s Volume Ten.

===&quot;Home&quot; and split===
John Butler Trio released the first single and title track &quot;Home&quot; in August 2018 ahead of the album, &quot;Home&quot;, which was released on 28 September.

On March 11, 2019, John Butler Trio announced that Byron Luiters and Grant Gerathy would be leaving the band.

In April 2024, with the release of his solo album &quot;Running River&quot;, Butler confirmed that the John Butler Trio had dissipated following the conclusion of the &quot;Home&quot; tour in late 2019.

<text>Orell Füssli is a Swiss banknotes printing and bookselling company, established by Christoph Froschauer in 1519 as a book printer and publisher. It is currently operating in many print-related segments, such as security printing, bookselling and publishing, with security printing being a primary contemporary product of company. Company&#x27;s shares are traded on SIX Swiss Exchange () since 1897. It is the oldest continuously publicly traded company of Switzerland.

== History ==
===From Froschauer Druckerei (1519) to &quot;Orell, Gessner, Füssli &amp; Cie.&quot; (1770)===

At the beginning of the 16th century, the Imperial free city of Zürich became increasingly important as a location holding the Federal Diet of Switzerland. After the position of the &quot;Leutpriestertum&quot; (people&#x27;s priest) of the Grossmünster at Zürich became vacant in late 1518, the canons of the foundation in charge of the Grossmünster elected Ulrich Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December 1519 he moved permanently to Zürich from where he subsequently initiated the Swiss Reformation. 

Around the same time, book printer Christoph Froschauer relocated from Altötting in Bavaria to Zürich to be granted the rights of citizen of Zürich in 1519. The city commissioned him with the task of setting up a printing press along with further assignments that would result in the establishment and expansion of the printers. Froschauersche Druckerei received the status of a state printer and ultimately published the works of Erasmus von Rotterdam, Martin Luther and Zwingli. Subsequently, Froschauer Druckerei expanded its product range to include historical, medical and scientific writings.

From 1530 to 1585, the Druckerei emerged as one of the most prominent publishers in the German-speaking field and in the years to follow, the business would change owners within the Zürich wealthy elite. Among the families involved were Escher, Wolf, Bodmer, Heidegger and Rahn with the Druckerei also changing its name after being acquired by one family from another.
In consequence of the progress of Counter-Reformation in Germany, the Druckerei was to scale down its product range to offer mainly theological writings and &quot;Sittenmandate&quot;. It is not until 1744, as the Zürich Ratsherr Johann Rudolf Füssli joined the company as a partner and shifted the focus to the areas of theology, natural sciences, history and arts. In 1766, he becomes the sole owner of the business which from then on is referred to as &quot;Füssli &amp; Cie.&quot;.

Hans Conrad von Orelli and his uncle Johann Jakob Bodmer run &quot;Orell &amp; Cie.&quot;, a publishing house with a Druckerei. The Gessner family who also operated a Druckerei since 1670 and later a bookshop joined &quot;Orell &amp; Cie.&quot; in 1761. Consequently, the business was renamed to &quot;Orell, Gessner &amp; Cie.&quot;

In 1770, both businesses - &quot;Füssli &amp; Cie.&quot; and &quot;Orell, Gessner &amp; Cie.&quot; - merged to become &quot;Orell, Gessner, Füssli &amp; Cie.&quot;

In 1780 the company expanded its product range by entering into the newspaper business with the publication of the &quot;Zürcher Zeitung&quot; that was to become &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; in 1821.
Almost 90 years upon expansion, the newspaper business was spun off in form of a separate Aktiengesellschaft in 1868.

At the end of the 18th century, it was notable for its bookshop in Zürich. It specialized in disseminating literature of the French Enlightenment by means of written orders through the publishing house &quot;Société typographique de Neuchâtel&quot; (STN), which was known to print banned books.

From 1793 to 1794, Orell Füssli published Marianne Ehrmann&#x27;s &quot;Die Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen&quot;, the first magazine published by a woman in Switzerland.

===19th century===
Upon the end of Napoleonic Wars, the appeal of Zürich as a publishing location sharply diminished.
As the competitive pressure increases on the market in Germany, the publishing program moves back to Switzerland related topics and the focus of the business shifts to printing.

The evidence for the first printing of securities dates back to 1827 and the first share certificates for Escher Wyss are printed in 1839.
In line with the developments of industrialisation in Switzerland, Orell Füssli becomes one of the first printers to introduce high-speed newsprint press and would use it in production of NZZ which from 1843 on is published daily.
On 1 March 1843, the canton of Zürich released the Zürich 4 and 6 printed by Orell Füssli, the first postage stamps in Switzerland, and the second series worldwide, following the Penny Black issued in the UK in 1840.
Upon the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848, the prerogative for operating postal services passes to the federal government in 1849 and the company did not further pursue this line of business.

The second half of the century provides Orell Füssli with enormous growth opportunities.

Switzerland&#x27;s first advertisement office (&quot;Annoncenbüro&quot;) is established which would subsequently turn into ofa Orell Füssli Werbe AG.
Railway advertising starts at a large scale requiring posters of all kinds alongside the emergence of tourist information offices who are looking for 
mass-printed travel brochures and timetables. Orell Füssli is able to accommodate for these demands. 
Upon introduction of the 10-colour Photochrom process for colour reproductions in 1880, Orell Füssli further expanded its range of product offerings to include reproductions of all kinds and, in particular, series of maps of foreign territories. In quick succession, the company opens numerous branches on the European continent and in the USA.

On 15 February 1870, the &quot;bank of the citizens of Zürich&quot;, Zürcher Kantonalbank founded by the canton of Zürich, opened its first bank counter. 
The mandate to print banknotes is assigned to Orell Füssli and the company begins to specialise in this field.

The year 1890 marked the birth of today&#x27;s modern company, which was transformed into the public limited company Art. Institut Orell Füssli. One year earlier the advertising agency founded in the middle of the 19th century had already been transformed into a public limited company, which latterly traded under the name ofa Orell Füssli Werbe AG and was sold to Publigroupe in 1998. 

The foundation of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in 1907 signalled the introduction of a uniform currency system with banknotes throughout Switzerland. In 1909, Orell Füssli printed banknotes based on Swiss designs for the SNB on a trial basis for the first time. Individual denominations of OF were printed from the second series introduced by the SNB in 1911.

Orell Füssli moved from the city centre to the Wiedikon district, which was incorporated in 1893, in 1923 due to lack of space. The inconspicuous building complex at Dietzingerstrasse 3 in the immediate vicinity of the old village centre has been the company&#x27;s headquarters ever since. With the move, the printing press equipment was upgraded, which led to the introduction of inline intaglio printing process on a broad front and determined everyday printing for decades. The publishing business was given its own independent market presence as Orell Füssli Verlag as early as 1925, and the name was immediately adopted as the company name in 1999 during the reorganisation and spin-off. 

In 1974 the company changed its name to Orell Füssli Graphische Betriebe AG (ofgb). Around the same time, with the design of the sixth banknote series, which was introduced by the SNB in 1976, the ofgb security printing department became the sole printer for all Swiss banknotes. 

The 1990s were characterised by upheaval, and a radical restructuring was carried out in 1992: the commercial printing plant was sold to Zürichsee Medien, Orell Füssli Kartographie became largely independent, while the banknote printing plant was further upgraded. Orell Füssli Buchhandlungs AG was founded with the German book retailer Heinrich Hugendubel (Buchhandlung zum Elsässer) as a minority shareholder. This effectively created the present-day company in terms of its portfolio (publishing, book retailing, security printing). 

Orell Füssli Buchhandlungs AG (51% OF, 49% Elsässer) moved into the prestigious Kramhof property at Füsslistrasse 4 and opened Switzerland&#x27;s largest bookshop there in 1993, which has been associated with the name Orell Füssli in Zurich ever since and is often confused with the company&#x27;s headquarters. The revitalised book retailing under the OF name was followed in 1996 by the launch of online book retailing under the domain books.ch.

ofa Orell Füssli Werbe AG was spun off as early as 1889 and taken over in 1998 by Lausanne-based Publigroupe, which merged the assets with its own companies, such as Publicis, thus removing the names ofa and Orell Füssli from the advertising market. A new group structure was created as part of a further reorganisation in 1999. Orell Füssli Graphische Betriebe Ltd. became Orell Füssli Holding Ltd. and the core operations of Graphische Betriebe - publishing (ofv) and security printing (ofs) - were spun off into independent subsidiaries under the holding company umbrella. 

Teledata Ltd, in which Orell Füssli already held an interest, was acquired in its entirety in 2001 and renamed Orell Füssli Wirtschaftsinformationen Ltd in 2003. On 1 July 2008 Orell Füssli Wirtschaftsinformationen Ltd. was wholly acquired by the Axon Active Ltd. group based in Lucerne. However, the name Orell Füssli Wirtschaftsinformationen AG was retained. In 2014 the company was acquired by the risk management solutions provider CRIF.

In July 2002 Orell Füssli acquired a 76% majority interest in the Atlantic Zeiser Group Ltd, which is based in Emmingen-Liptingen (Germany) and had subsidiaries in France, Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. The acquisition expands the repertoire ofs on the one hand and offers it the opportunity to market its expertise worldwide on the other. The complete takeover of the company was finalised at the beginning of November 2005. 

Atlantic Zeiser Group AG was active in the telephone and credit card business, passport systems and numbering boxes. With the advent of mobile phones and the decline of telephone cards, Atlantic Zeiser Group AG entered an economic crisis. In 2018 the card business was sold to Coesia (IT), while the business with components for the security printing industry remained within Orell Füssli Holding as Zeiser.

In 2020, Orell Füssli Holding merged with its subsidiaries Orell Füssli Security Printing Ltd and Orell Füssli Dienstleistungs Ltd and has since traded as Orell Füssli Ltd.

In 2020, Orell Füssli Ltd acquired a stake in the technology company Procivis, followed by the majority takeover in 2021.

In 2022, Orell Füssli Ltd acquired hep Verlag AG, a Swiss publisher of textbooks and reference books based in Berne.

<doc id="528064" wikidata="Q1479702" url="?curid=528064" title="Sousveillance">
<text>Sousveillance ( ) is the recording of an activity by a member of the public, rather than a person or organisation in authority, typically by way of small wearable or portable personal technologies. The term, coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words &quot;sur&quot;, meaning &quot;above&quot;, and &quot;sous&quot;, meaning &quot;below&quot;, i.e. &quot;surveillance&quot; denotes the &quot;eye-in-the-sky&quot; watching from above, whereas &quot;sousveillance&quot; denotes bringing the means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings) or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures).

While surveillance and sousveillance both usually refer to visual monitoring, they can denote other forms of monitoring such as audio surveillance or sousveillance. With audio (e.g. recording of phone conversations), sousveillance is sometimes referred to as &quot;one party consent&quot;.

Undersight (inverse oversight) is sousveillance at high-level, e.g. &quot;citizen undersight&quot; being reciprocal to a congressional oversight committee or the like.

Inverse surveillance is a subset of sousveillance with an emphasis on &quot;watchful vigilance from underneath&quot; and a form of surveillance inquiry or legal protection involving the recording, monitoring, study, or analysis of surveillance systems, proponents of surveillance, and possibly also recordings of authority figures. Inverse surveillance is typically undertaken by those who are subjected to surveillance, so it can be thought of as a form of ethnography or ethnomethodology (i.e. an analysis of the surveilled from the perspective of a participant in a society under surveillance). Sousveillance typically involves community-based recording from first person perspectives, without necessarily involving any specific political agenda, whereas inverse surveillance is a form of sousveillance that is typically directed at, or used to collect data to analyze or study, surveillance or its proponents (e.g., the actions of police or protestors at a protest rally).

Sousveillance is not necessarily countersurveillance. Sousveillance can be used to &quot;counter&quot; surveillance or it can be used with surveillance to create a more complete &quot;veillance&quot; (&quot;Surveillance is a half-truth without sousveillance&quot;). The question of &quot;Who watches the watchers&quot; is dealt with more properly under the topic of metaveillance (the veillance of veillance) than sousveillance.

== Inverse surveillance ==
Inverse surveillance is a type of sousveillance. The more general concept of sousveillance goes beyond just inverse surveillance and the associated twentieth-century political &quot;us &quot;versus&quot; them&quot; framework for citizens to photograph police, shoppers to photograph shopkeepers, or passengers to photograph taxicab drivers. Howard Rheingold commented in his book &quot;Smart Mobs&quot; that this is similar to the pedestrian−driver concept, i.e. these are roles that many of us take both sides on, from time to time. Many aspects of sousveillance were examined in the general category of &quot;reciprocal accountability&quot; in David Brin&#x27;s 1997 non-fiction book The Transparent Society, and also in Brin&#x27;s novels. The first &quot;International Workshop on Inverse Surveillance&quot;, IWIS, took place in 2004, chaired by Dr. Jim Gemmell, (MyLifeBits), Joi Ito, Anastasios Venetsanopoulos, and Steve Mann, among others.

One of the things that brought inverse surveillance to light was the reactions of security guards to electric seeing aids and similar sousveillance practices. It seemed, early on, that the more cameras that were in an establishment, the more the guards disliked the use of an electric seeing aid, such as the EyeTap eyeglasses. It was through simply wearing electric seeing aids, as a passive observer, that it was discovered that surveillance and sousveillance can cause conflict and sometimes confrontation. This led some researchers to explore why the perpetrators of surveillance are suspicious of sousveillance, and thus defined the notion of inverse surveillance as a new and interesting facet of studies in sousveillance.

Since the year 2001, December 24 has been World Sousveillance Day with groups of participants in New York City, Toronto, Boston, Florida, Vancouver, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom. However, this designated day focuses only on hierarchical sousveillance, whereas there are a number of groups around the world working on combining the two forms of sousveillance.

An essay from &quot;Wired&quot; magazine predicts that sousveillance is an important development that will be on the rise in 2014.

Sousveillance of a state by its citizens has been credited with addressing many problems such as election fraud or electoral misdeeds, as well as providing good governance. For example, mobile phones were used in Sierra Leone and Ghana in 2007 for checking malpractices and intimidation during elections.

A recent area of research further developed at IWIS was the equilibrium between surveillance and sousveillance. Current &quot;equiveillance theory&quot; holds that sousveillance, to some extent, often reduces or eliminates the need for surveillance. In this sense it is possible to replace the Panoptic God&#x27;s eye view of surveillance with a more community-building ubiquitous personal experience capture. Crimes, for example, might then be solved by way of collaboration among the citizenry rather than through the watching over the citizenry from above. But it is not so black-and-white as this dichotomy suggests. In particular, citizens watching over their neighbors is not necessarily &quot;better&quot; than the alternative: an increase in community self-reliance might be offset by an uncomfortable &quot;nosy neighbor&quot; effect. &quot;Personal sousveillance&quot; has been referred to as &quot;coveillance&quot; by Mann, Nolan and Wellman.

Copwatch is a network of American and Canadian volunteer organizations that &quot;police the police.&quot; Copwatch groups usually engage in monitoring of the police, videotaping police activity, and educating the public about police misconduct. Fitwatch is a group that photograph Forward Intelligence Teams (police photographers) in the United Kingdom.

In 2008, Cambridge researchers (in the MESSAGE project) teamed with bicycle couriers to measure and transmit air pollution indicators as they travel the city.

In 2012 the Danish daily newspaper and online title Dagbladet Information crowdmapped the positions of surveillance cameras by encouraging readers to use a free Android and iOS app to photograph and geolocate CCTV cameras.

== Personal sousveillance ==

Personal sousveillance is the art, science, and technology of personal experience capture, processing, storage, retrieval, and transmission, such as lifelong audiovisual recording by way of cybernetic prosthetics, such as seeing-aids, visual memory aids, and the like. Even today&#x27;s personal sousveillance technologies like camera phones and weblogs tend to build a sense of community, in contrast to surveillance that some have said is corrosive to community.

The legal, ethical, and policy issues surrounding personal sousveillance are largely yet to be explored, but there are close parallels to the social and legal norms surrounding recording of telephone conversations. When one or more parties to the conversation record it, it is called &quot;sousveillance&quot;, whereas when the conversation is recorded by a person who is not a party to the conversation (such as a prison guard violating a client-lawyer relationship), the recording is called &quot;surveillance&quot;.

&quot;Targeted sousveillance&quot; refers to sousveillance of a specific individual by one or more other individuals. Usually, the targeted individual is a representative or proponent of surveillance, so targeted sousveillance is often inverse surveillance or hierarchical sousveillance. &quot;Hierarchical sousveillance&quot; refers, for example, to citizens photographing the police, shoppers photographing shopkeepers, or taxicab passengers photographing cab drivers. So, for example, targeting former White House security official Admiral John Poindexter with sousveillance follows this more political narrative.

Classy&#x27;s Kitchen describes sousveillance as &quot;another way to add further introspection to the commons that keeps society open but still makes the world smaller and safer&quot;. In this way sousveillance may be regarded as a possible replacement for surveillance. In this sur/sousveillance replacement, one can consider an operative social norm that would require cameras to be attached to a human operator. Under such a scenario, any objections to the camera could be raised by another human more easily than it would be to interact with a lamp post upon which is mounted a surveillance camera. Thus, the argument is that cameras attached to people ought to be less offensive than cameras attached to inanimate objects, because there is at least one responsible party present to operate the camera. This responsible-party argument is analogous to that used for the operation of a motor vehicle, where a responsible driver is present, in contrast to the remote or automated operation of a motor vehicle.

Beyond the political or breaching of hierarchical structure explored in academia, the more rapidly emerging discourse on sousveillance within the industry is &quot;personal sousveillance&quot;, namely the recording of an activity by a participant in the activity.

As the technologies get smaller and easier to use, the capture, recording, and playback of everyday life get that much easier to initiate spontaneously in unexpected situations. For example, David Ollila, a manufacturer of video camera equipment, was trapped for four hours aboard a Comair plane at JFK Airport in New York City. When he recorded an interview with the pilot about the situation, the pilot called the police who then removed Ollila for questioning and removed everyone from the plane.

Recording a situation is only part of the sousveillance process. Communicating is also important. Video-sharing sites such as YouTube and photo-sharing sites such as Flickr play a vital role. For example, police &quot;agents provocateur&quot; were quickly revealed on YouTube when they infiltrated a demonstration in Montebello, Quebec, against the leaders of Canada, Mexico and the United States (August 2007). When the head of the Quebec police publicly stated that there was no police presence, a sousveillance video showed him to be wrong. When he revised his statement to say that the police provocateurs were peaceful observers, the same video showed them to be masked, wearing police boots, and in one case holding a rock.

There are many similar examples, such as the widely viewed YouTube video of UCLA campus policemen tasering a student. In Russia, as well as in some other countries where road users trust neither each other nor police, onboard cameras are so ubiquitous that thousands of videos of automobile accidents and near-miss incidents have been uploaded. The unanticipated 2013 Russian meteor event was well documented from a dozen angles via the use of these devices. Similarly, in February 2015, dashcams caught valuable footage of the crash of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235.

==Alibi sousveillance==

Alibi sousveillance is a form of sousveillance activity aimed at generating an alibi as evidence to defend against allegations of wrongdoing.

Hasan Elahi, a University of Maryland professor, has produced a sousveillance for his entire life, after being detained at an airport because he was erroneously placed on the US terrorist watchlist. Some of his sousveillance activities include using his cell phone as a tracking device, and publicly posting debit card and other transactions that document his actions.

One specific use of alibi sousveillance is the growing trend of police officers wearing body cameras while on patrol. Well-publicized events involving police-citizen altercations (such as the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri) have increased calls for police to wear body cameras and so capture evidence of the incidents, for their benefit and the criminal justice system as a whole. By having officers use sousveillance, police forces can generate hours of video evidence to be used in cases like that of Michael Brown, and the video evidence can act as an important alibi in the judicial proceedings in regards to who is truly at fault. Regardless of the outcome of such events, contemporaneous audio-video evidence can be extremely valuable in respect of compliance- and enforcement-related events.

==Police use==
Use of wearable cameras by police officers combined with video streaming and recording in an archive produces a record of the interactions of the officer with civilians and criminals. Experiments with police use in Rialto, California from 2012 to 2013 resulted in a reduction of both complaints against officers and a reduction in the use of violence by officers. The public is shielded from police misconduct and the police officer from bogus complaints.

Because these body cameras are turned on for every encounter with the public, privacy issues have been brought up with specific emphasis on special victim cases such as rape or domestic violence. Police worry that with a camera right in front of the victim, they will not feel comfortable revealing all the information that they know. There have been two case studies done in the United States that have revealed that police officers who have cameras have fewer encounters with citizens than officers who do not have cameras, due to fear of being reprimanded for committing a mistake.

== Sousveillance cultures ==
Prior to contemporary sousveillance cultures, Simone Browne (2015) used &quot;dark sousveillance&quot; to refer to the ways that enslaved Black Americans refashioned techniques and technologies to facilitate survival and escape. Browne (2015) notes how pranks and other performative practices and creative acts were used to resist enslavement from experiential insight.

In the era of web-based participatory media and convergence cultures, non-governmental and non-state actors, with their own virtual communities and networks that cut across national borders, use what Bakir (2010) calls the sousveillant assemblage to wield discursive power. The sousveillant assemblage comprises Haggerty &amp; Ericson&#x27;s (2000) surveillant assemblage (or loosely linked, unstable, systems of data flows of people&#x27;s activities, tracked by computers, and data-mined so that we are each reconfigured as (security) risks or (commercial) opportunities, but data-fattened by the proliferation of web-based participatory media and personal sousveillance that we willingly provide online). Verde Garrido (2015) has also explored Mann&#x27;s concept of sousveillance and reinterpreted Michel Foucault&#x27;s notion of parrhesia (i.e., confronting authority and power with the truth) to explain that in contemporary societies, which are global and digital, &#x27;parrhesiastic sousveillance&#x27; allows to resist and contest social, economic, and political relations of power by means of technology. These acts of resistance and contestation, in turn, enable civil societies to change old meanings and offer new ones, using a newborn digital agency to create new and contemporary politics of truth.

Features of sousveillance cultures:
* Dissent, and holding power-holders to account, is easier 
Undoubtedly, the urge and practice of dissent have been common, and people exploit the participatory media technologies at hand to mark and spread their dissent. However, the rise of web-based participatory media and sousveillance cultures have made it easier for many more to record and spread this dissent globally, unimpeded by traditional media&#x27;s commercial distribution restrictions such as pre-defined circulation runs or paid-for airtime, or the need for expert knowledge in media production. Mann has long maintained that the &#x27;informal nature of sousveillance, with its tendency to distribute recordings widely, will often expose inappropriate use to scrutiny, whereas the secret nature of surveillance will tend to prevent misuse from coming to light&#x27; (Mann, 2005, p. 641). Just as Foucault&#x27;s Panopticon operates through potential or implied surveillance, sousveillance might also operate through the credible threat of its existence. As the ubiquity and awareness of sousveillance widen, it is this that may most empower citizens – by making officials realise that their actions may, themselves, be monitored and exposed at any time. The permanent potential for sousveillance from so many (as opposed to more formalised exposés at the hands of investigative reporters, a small media elite) raises the likelihood that power abuses will be captured on record which can then be used to hold power-abusers and manipulators to account, providing of course, that there is a functioning legal system and/or public sphere (with mechanisms in place to translate popular demands and moral outrage into real-world change). 
* Emancipation, resistance and social change are unpredictable.
In the case of police body camera implementation in the US, there are multiple responses and social implications to this form of sousveillance. The case against police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement has garnered an immense and impassioned following in a very short amount of time. There are two different social movements that have arisen in response to police body cameras. One school of thought that has manifested support is that police body cameras are necessary in fighting and ending police brutality. The other is the opposing stance to this one that raises the issue of privacy that police body cameras may violate. There have not been many case studies that have taken place in implementing police body cameras. This means that police worn body cameras have not been proven as a definite method to solve the problem of police brutality. Studies have also shown that people, both policemen and civilians, act differently when they are aware that they are being surveilled on camera. This leaves a lot of room for unpredictability surrounding the consequences of the use of this form of sousveillance.

In Mann&#x27;s original conception, sousveillance had an emancipatory political thrust, with hierarchical sousveillance a conscious act of resistance to surveillance. Yet, the nature of the social change generated is unpredictable and dependent on the sousveillant content, the context of its subsequent sharing, and, of course, the strength of the traditions of deliberation for democratic purposes. ISIS&#x27; use of sousveillance, then, may result in social change, but not in a progressive fashion.
* Sousveillers&#x27; anonymity is crucial.
Given the lack of secrecy inherent in placing sousveillant content online, the anonymity of the sousveillers is of prime importance if hierarchical (politically or legally motivated) sousveillance is to proliferate. There is a real need for spaces online that are willing to protect users&#x27; anonymity and keep their subversive content online despite political or corporate pressure. With this sort of situation in mind, whistle-blowing websites have been set up that guarantee anonymity, such as Wiki-leaks, launched in December 2006. More such sites are needed.
* Agenda-building power comes from the searchable and recirculated, semi-permanent, eyewitness archive.
Social media provide what could be described as a semi-permanent, and easily accessible database of eyewitness accounts. Given that the web can be used and searched in the manner of a database to find examples of sousveillance; and given the recirculation of sousveillant footage in memes and in mainstream media, ever-hungry for new content in a media environment of convergence and expanding capacity, the longevity of sousveillant footage is perhaps what gives sousveillance its agenda-building power. It allows journalists, citizens, activists, insurgents, strategic communicators and researchers the opportunity to discover and partially relive both the eye-witnessed, sousveillant account, and the discourse surrounding specific moments of sousveillance, as well as reflecting on, and marshalling, their significance.

== In fiction ==
David Brin&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Earth&quot; portrays citizens equipped with both augmented reality gear (&quot;Tru-Vu Goggles&quot;) and cameras exercising reciprocal accountability, with each other and with authority figures, discussing effects on crime and presaging today&#x27;s &quot;cop cam&quot; developments. Elites are allowed only temporary, cached secrecy. In Robert Sawyer&#x27;s Neanderthal Parallax trilogy, the &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; occupying a parallel universe have what are called companion implants. These are comprehensive recording and transmission devices, mounted in the forearm of each person. Their entire life is constantly monitored and sent to their alibi archive, a repository of recordings that are only accessible by their owner, or by the proper authorities when investigating an infraction, and in the latter case only in circumstances relevant to the investigation. Recordings are maintained after death; it is not made clear what the reasoning is for this and under what circumstances and or by whom a deceased person&#x27;s archive can be accessed.

The plot of the 1995 movie &quot;Strange Days&quot; is based on a future where sousveillance recordings are made and sold as entertainment. The plot of the movie revolves around the murder of a celebrity by police officers that is recorded by a person secretly wearing one of the devices. In the movie, the recordings are made by a flat array of sensors that pick up signals from the brain stem. The sensors are usually hidden under a wig, and they record everything the person wearing them sees and hears. Recordings made while the person making them dies are called &quot;blackjack&quot; tapes.

The plot of the 1985 John Crowley short story &quot;Snow&quot; revolves around a suspended camera recording the whole of a subject&#x27;s life being sold as a consumer product.

The 2007 novel &quot;Halting State&quot; by Charles Stross and its sequel &quot;Rule 34&quot; depict a 2020s Scotland in which wearable computing has a level of ubiquity similar to that of 2013&#x27;s cell phones. The implications of a society in which anyone might be recording anything at any time are explored at length, particularly with respect to policing.

The open source science fiction role-playing game &quot;Eclipse Phase&quot; has sousveillance as a common part of life in the setting, as a result of data storage technology and high-definition digital cameras becoming commonplace and often integrated into any and all objects.

Orson Scott Card&#x27;s novel, &quot;the Worthing Chronicle&quot; also investigates the effect of (apparently) omnipotent watchers, and how it can degrade human experience—the moral dilemma leading the watchers to cease. Vernor Vinge&#x27;s character, Pham Nuwen presciently recognizes the stage of &quot;ubiquitous surveillance&quot; in the collapse-and-rebuild cycle that plagues human planetary civilization in &quot;a Deepness in the Sky&quot;.

== Sousveillance efficiency or efficacy ==
There is a need for efficacy, efficiency or effectiveness of sousveillance, which can be met by social media, such as through widespread dissemination on social media, and when used as an output modality in conjunction with sousveillance as an input modality, is called &quot;swollag&quot;, or gallows spelled backwards. For example, filming or streaming an abusive situation, like police abuse, doesn&#x27;t always lead to justice and punishment of the abuser without some means (i.e. swollag) for sousveillance to take effect. For example, in 2014, a man named Eric Garner was choked to death by a police officer in Staten Island after being arrested on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes. &quot;Garner&#x27;s death was documented by his friend Ramsey Orta, and the video was widely disseminated. Despite the video evidence, a grand jury declined to indict Garner&#x27;s killer, leading to widespread outrage and protest. (In an ironic twist, the only person indicted in connection with Garner&#x27;s death was Orta, who came under police scrutiny and was arrested on an &quot;unrelated&quot; weapons possession charge. Orta is now in prison in New York. Sousveillance is not without its costs.)&quot;

However, it appeared that a filmed abusive behavior is more likely to be punished if the video is widely spread. This makes sousveillance more efficient and politically meaningful, insofar it shows to a significant proportion of the population the abuses of the authority. Thus, the development of video platforms, like YouTube and Snapchat, and streaming platforms like Periscope and Twitch, are key components to sousveillance&#x27;s efficiency. This was shown during French demonstrations against the &quot;Loi Travail&quot; in 2016, during which a Periscope stream showing authority forces, called abusive by one part of the demonstrators, was watched by 93,362 people. This video was posted on Twitter. Nevertheless, it can be considered whether this creates a dangerous dependence on private platforms, often ruled by Internet giants (like Google, for YouTube) which have common interests with governments, and who adapt their content through algorithms users don&#x27;t have control on.

In addition, some argue that sousveillance may aid in state surveillance, despite being conducted by the people. Examples include mobile apps used to help people signal public threats, such as the Israeli app c-Now (previously known as Reporty). In January 2018, c-Now was tested in Nice by the mayor Christian Estrosi, sparking virulent public debates, with security advocates reporting spyware associated with the app Furthermore, the director of c-Now is Ehud Barack, former prime minister of Israel, who is suspected to have kept close links with Israeli and American governments. For these reasons, security advocates consider the app to serve America&#x27;s global surveillance program (revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013), and raise the question of whether sousveillance really serves as &quot;inverse surveillance&quot;.

<text>The Corruptor is a 1999 American action film directed by James Foley. The film was written by Robert Pucci, and produced by Dan Halsted. The film stars Chow Yun-fat and Mark Wahlberg. The film was released in the United States on March 12, 1999.

==Plot==
NYPD Lieutenant Nick Chen is head of the Asian Gang Unit. His job is to keep the peace in Chinatown from a turf war that has broken out between the Tung Fung Benevolent Association tong and the Fukienese Dragons street gang. The problem is complicated by the fact that he is also an informant for the Tongs under Uncle Benny Wong and his lieutenant Henry Lee. After a bombing in Chinatown, Chen is reluctantly teamed up with Danny Wallace, who is unaware of Chen&#x27;s corruption. Danny was also secretly tasked by Internal Affairs to monitor Chen. Danny lied to Chen and the Asian Gang Unit by claiming that he had taken the job to gain his detective shield quickly.

During a police raid on a Fukienese whorehouse, Chen saves Wallace&#x27;s life. Wallace, knowing that his life is now in Chen&#x27;s hands, initiates a bust on a drug operation, not knowing that an undercover FBI agent is involved. After being berated by the FBI for interfering with an ongoing investigation, Wallace is introduced to Lee. Lee discusses the potential value of having another cop in the AGU on the Tong payroll, which Uncle Benny allows. Benny is able to lure Wallace into working for him by tipping him off to an underground prostitution ring. Wallace is given a commendation for valor, but Chen now suspects him working for the Tongs.

Wallace and Chen inadvertently cross paths, throwing their initial trust for each other out the window and putting Lee&#x27;s intentions into question. Chen hates the Fukienese, but neither he nor Danny knows that Lee is forming a partnership with their leader Bobby Vu. Both Lee and Vu know that there is an FBI agent undercover in their drug operation and decide to kill him.

While monitoring a drug operation, Wallace and Chen witness a violent confrontation with a Tong hit squad that leads to Chen getting berated for botching the FBI investigation. After the incident, Wallace and Chen swear not to talk to the FBI without talking to each other first. The FBI finds out Wallace&#x27;s real reason for joining the AGU and threatens to expose him unless he is willing to spy on Chen. When one of Chen&#x27;s informants witnesses Vu&#x27;s assassination of Uncle Benny, Chen alerts the DA, who intends to indict the Tongs under RICO. The DA, the FBI, and both Wallace and Chen decide that they want to catch Vu in the act and decide to hold off on the arrests.

Lee chooses to alert Chen of Wallace&#x27;s real identity and job. During the nighttime operation, Chen draws his gun on Wallace in anger. Wallace reasons with Chen and the two fight the Dragons, killing most of them. Chen pushes Wallace out of the way and is fatally shot by Vu. Wallace then shoots Vu. While at the hospital, Wallace refuses to withdraw his original statement that Chen died a good cop. Later, Wallace leads the arrest of Lee. Chen is then given a hero&#x27;s funeral with Wallace in the procession.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The movie received mixed reviews from critics and audience. It currently has a ranking of 49% on Rotten Tomatoes with a critic consensus that reads &quot;This uninspiring cop thriller doesn&#x27;t measure up to Chow Yun-Fat&#x27;s Hong Kong work.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said, &quot;Even when it&#x27;s transplanted to the streets of New York&#x27;s Chinatown, as &quot;The Corruptor&quot; is, the Hong Kong action genre has certain obligatory requirements. Low-angle shots of bad guys looming over the camera, for example. And the sound of a metallic whoosh when there&#x27;s a quick cut from one scene to the next. And what seems like more dialogue during action scenes than before and after them... Director James Foley is obviously not right for this material. It&#x27;s a shame, actually, that he&#x27;s even working in the genre since his gift is with the intense study of human behavior...&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Corruptor&quot; grossed a total of $24,493,693 worldwide, including $15,164,492 in the United States and $9,329,109 in other territories.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack of &quot;The Corruptor&quot; features underground hip hop songs by artists including Mobb Deep, Spice 1 and Mystikal. The original score for &quot;The Corruptor&quot; contains music composed by Carter Burwell.
