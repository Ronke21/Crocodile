<text>TRSDOS (which stands for the Tandy Radio Shack Disk Operating System) is the operating system for the Tandy TRS-80 line of eight-bit Zilog Z80 microcomputers that were sold through Radio Shack from 1977 through 1991. Tandy&#x27;s manuals recommended that it be pronounced &quot;triss-doss&quot;. TRSDOS should not be confused with Tandy DOS, a version of MS-DOS licensed from Microsoft for Tandy&#x27;s x86 line of personal computers (PCs).

With the original TRS-80 Model I of 1977, TRSDOS was primarily a way of extending the MBASIC (BASIC in ROM) with additional I/O (input/output) commands that worked with disk files rather than the cassette tapes that were used by non-disk Model I systems. Later disk-equipped Model III computers used a completely different version of TRSDOS by Radio Shack which culminated in 1981 with TRSDOS Version 1.3. From 1983 disk-equipped TRS-80 Model 4 computers used TRSDOS Version 6, which was a development of Model III LDOS by Logical Systems, Inc. This last was updated in 1987 and released as LS-DOS 6.3.

Completely unrelated was a version of TRSDOS by Radio Shack for its TRS-80 Model II professional computer from 1979, also based on the Z80 and equipped with 8-inch disk drives. The later machines in this line, the Models 12, 16 and 6000, used the Z80 as an alternate CPU to its main Motorola 68000 chip and could run this version of TRSDOS for backwards compatibility with older Z80 applications software.

==History==
Tandy Corporation&#x27;s TRS-80 microcomputer did not have a disk drive or disk operating system at release. The first version of TRSDOS, by Randy Cook, was so buggy that others wrote alternatives, including NewDOS and LDOS. After disputes with Cook over ownership of the source code, Tandy hired Logical Systems, LDOS&#x27;s developer, to continue TRSDOS development. TRSDOS 6, shipped with the TRS-80 Model 4 in 1983, is identical to LDOS 6.00.

===Dates===
* October, 1979 – Radio Shack releases TRSDOS 2.3
* May 1, 1981 – Radio Shack releases Model III TRSDOS 1.3
* April 26, 1983 – Radio Shack introduces TRSDOS Version 6.0 with the new Model 4s
* 1984 – Radio Shack releases Version 6.2, the definitive version for the Model 4
* 1984 – Logical Systems publishes &quot;The Source&quot;, the commented assembler source code to TRSDOS 6.2
* Late 1986 – Logical Systems releases LS-DOS 6.3, the functionally equivalent update to TRSDOS 6.2. From this date, Tandy/Radio Shack ships it with the Model 4D.

==Features and capabilities==
RadioShack&#x27;s Z80-based line of TRS-80 computers (Models I/III and Model 4) support up to four physical floppy (mini-diskette) drives which (as sold) use 5¼-inch diskettes. The original TRSDOS for the Model I supported only single-sided disks with 35 tracks formatted in single density (sectors are encoded using the frequency modulation technique). Model III TRSDOS (culminating in version 1.3) supported 40-track disks formatted in double density (using modified frequency modulation). Model Is retrofitted with double density controllers and Models I/III equipped with 80-track drives or double-sided drives could not use TRSDOS; RadioShack sold Logical System&#x27;s LDOS operating system which could control these types of drives. The Model 4&#x27;s TRSDOS 6 is a development of LDOS and has the same capabilities.

Hard disk drives (then also known as winchester drives) required custom driver software supplied by their manufacturers. These drivers permitted any TRSDOS installation to access them with up to eight possible drive partitions, each assigned to drive numbers zero through seven. Actually, a large hard drive could be formatted with more than eight partitions, but TRSDOS can only access eight during any one session. Hard drives could have some partitions formatted under TRSDOS and others under the CP/M OS. Each floppy drive in the system would also take up one drive number assignment. The Model 4, with its ability to set up a ramdisk (Memdisk), also required a drive number assignment for this.

All versions of TRSDOS use overlays to satisfy most system requests and disk directories are not maintained in memory. This has two implications for system performance. First, upon initial file access the DOS always references the disk directory to obtain information giving the physical mapping of disk space allocated to the file (including its extents, if any). After the initial access this information is maintained in a File Control Block, the memory space for which is supplied by the calling application. Further references do not need to read the disk directory (unless the file is written to and more disk space needs to be allocated). For this reason system performance depends greatly on how close a file&#x27;s allocated disk space(s) is/are to the directory cylinder, and how fragmented (extents located in non-contiguous space(s)) the file is as a whole. The farther away the directory cylinder is, the more the drive&#x27;s read/write head will need to move, which slows disk access and produces more mechanical wear on the drive. TRSDOS has commands permitting the user to optimize placement of particular files on the disk&#x27;s physical space, and the command to display a map of a file&#x27;s physical placement on a drive.

The second implication of the overlay-based architecture is that a disk containing TRSDOS system files (file extension /SYS) must always be present in whichever drive is assigned as logical drive number zero. (On the Model 4 this may be the Memdisk, thus freeing physical drive zero be used for a non-system data disk). LDOS and TRSDOS 6 have a SYSRES command which loads selected system files into Z80 RAM, thus freeing space on the system disk for non-system data. All versions have variants of the SYSTEM command which can reassign logical drive numbers to physical drives. It is possible to assign drive numbers such that a physical drive is unassigned a logical drive number; this is sometimes useful to guarantee that the drive cannot be accessed for security or safety (write protection) purposes. Drives may be set to be write protected by the DOS, also.

===Disk management===
The primary function of any disk operating system is to provide the user with a facility for managing and accessing files stored on disk storage devices. Since the user must not be burdened with the physical details of the storage devices themselves, it is the operating system&#x27;s responsibility to translate file record access requests into specific drive, track, sector, and head parameters that pinpoint the storage location of each record.

The system also maintains in Z80 memory within TRSDOS a Drive Control Table that stores the parameters associated with each of the eight logical drives. Disk drive parameters refer to how the total storage space on a drive is divided up into addressable units. The layer(s) of magnetic particles on the surface of the disk media are magnetized (during the format process) into concentric circles of storage areas called TRACKS. Each track is divided into 256-byte sub-areas called SECTORS. Each sector is uniquely identified by a pattern of information preceding each sector called an ID FIELD. Although the number of sectors per track may vary from one media type to another, the number of sectors in each track of the same media (and in each granule) must always be a constant.

Disks are organized as follows: each track is formatted into a specific number of 256-byte sectors with a maximum capacity of 32 sectors per track. Sectors are grouped into blocks called granules which vary in size according to total track capacity of the disk media, though granule size for each disk format is constant. For forty-cylinder disks formatted in double density, standard for the drives installed in the TRS-80 Models III and 4, the granule size is six 256-byte sectors, or 1.5 KB. Each track has three granules for 4.5 KB of storage. Each side (surface) of the disk is normally formatted with 40 tracks, yielding 180 KB per side. The Model 4D, with its double-sided drives, yields 360 KB of storage. Whenever additional disk space is needed for a file (such as extending a file while being written to), an additional granule is allocated. The granule thus becomes the minimum size storage unit.

TRSDOS assigns numbers to every sector, every track, and every surface. Surfaces are numbered consecutively starting from zero. Tracks are numbered consecutively starting from zero at the outermost edge of the disk giving the innermost track the highest number. Where multiple headed drives are in use, the track numbers on a surface are duplicated on each surface with all similarly numbered tracks constituting a cylinder. For a double-sided floppy disk as formatted on a Model 4D, track zero of surface zero and track zero of surface one are grouped together into cylinder zero. Cylinder capacities also have an upper limit of 256 sectors per cylinder or eight granules per cylinder, while the system supports (for hard drives with multiple platters of storage media) a maximum of eight heads per drive.

The disk&#x27;s directory cylinder is placed during the format process on the middle-numbered cylinder; thus a standard 40 cylinder disk has its directory installed on cylinder 20. This reduces the average distance (and access time) that the drive&#x27;s read/write head must move to access the directory. The first sector of the disk directory contains the Granule Allocation Table (GAT). The GAT is bit mapped to each granule of space on the drive. Other fields in the GAT contain the PACK NAME, DATE of creation (when the disk was formatted), pack PASSWORD, and data pertaining to the configuration of the drive.

When a file is to be opened for access, the system needs to search the directory for its directory record. Search time is minimized by using a hashing technique to reduce the 11-character string formed from the file name and extension to a one byte value. The hash code for each file is stored in a Hash Index Table (HIT) which is the second sector of the directory. Each position in this table corresponds to a specific directory entry record. The hash table, being one sector in length, can index a maximum of 256 directory records or files. The directory itself is sized according to disk capacity by being a maximum of one cylinder (up to 34 sectors). Thus, the larger the disk storage capacity, the larger its directory, and the greater the number of file names that can be stored on the disk.

The directory record contains information such as the date the file was last modified, its update and access password codes, its access level, and other attributes such as whether it is a SYStem or PDS (Partitioned Data Set) file and if a backup has been made, the relative number of the last sector in the file, and the last byte within the last sector (or End Of File). The record also contains the physical area(s) in use by the file, by pointing to the cylinder, relative starting granule, and number of contiguous granules for each extent comprising the file. When a file has more than four extents, additional directory records are used as required with forward and backward pointers linking each record of each file. Thus the theoretical maximum of 256 files possible on a floppy diskette is realizable only if there is no file fragmentation.

When TRSDOS formats a disk, all of the parameters associated with the diskette are predetermined. Thus the number of sectors per track, number of sectors per granule and thus the granules per track, number of sides (surfaces), and number of cylinders are all designated, as well as the density of the media. Some of these figures (density, sides, granules per track) are written to fields in the Granule Allocation Table which is part of the disk directory. Others (sectors per track, sectors per granule, in addition to the former quantities) are part of the Drive Control Table fields. When the system attempts to open a file on a disk, it uses the @CKDRV SVC to ascertain the availability of the disk, and then logs the disk once it finds it available. This &quot;logging&quot; function will update the DIRCYL field, then update the DBLBIT and MAXCYL fields based on information stored in the GAT. This procedure frees the user from having to manually log a newly inserted disk; he is at liberty to change differently formatted disks in any drive without concern that the system will incorrectly access it.

The SVC disk primitives are funneled through common system routines contained in the driver software installed for each type of disk storage device. The driver for Model III or Model 4 floppy drives is named and is located in the TRSDOS low memory region. Hard disk drives are supplied with their own driver software, and are usually installed in high memory (main 64K Z80 RAM) above the system pointer, since room in the low memory region is usually insufficient (especially on the Model 4 since software needed to access its external memory banks cannot reside in high Z80 RAM memory because that region exists in the banked RAM swap area). These driver routines establish a linkage protocol between the application requesting disk access and the computer&#x27;s Floppy Disk Controller hardware. TRS-80s use controller chips from the Western Digital series: the WD1791 in the Model 4 non-gate array version, and the WD1773 in the Model 4 Gate Array version. When an I/O request is invoked by a higher level SVC, such as a request to READ a file record, the request is translated to that disk primitive (FDC command or status report) needed to satisfy the function request. The linkage protocol is uniform across all disk devices that are connected to the system. This makes the access of files transparent to size or nature of the disk device within the scope of the parameters stored in the DCT for that drive.

===File management===
Disk files are supported with two types of access: Record I/O and character I/O. Logical records of from one to 256 bytes in length can be read or written using the @READ or @WRITE SVC requests. Record I/O can be random access (by position SVC requests prior to READ/WRITE) or sequential access using repetitive READs or WRITEs. Character (or byte) I/O is accomplished by @GET and @PUT SVC requests and is essentially the same as record I/O with a &quot;Logical Record Length&quot; (LRL) equal to one. (Physical access to a disk storage device is always in units of 256 byte sectors. This is fixed by the TRS-80 disk controller hardware). However, if GET or PUT are used to implement sequential access, then a file can be considered a character I/O device just like a printer, a serial port, or a video display device. A byte I/O request is therefore independent of the physical device &quot;connected&quot; to the control block which is requesting the I/O. This makes the system &quot;device independent&quot;.

Filenames are limited to eight alphanumeric characters (the first character must be alpha) which are case insensitive (only capital letters are used; any lowercase letters entered are capitalized). File extensions are up to three characters and obey the same rules. File passwords are up to eight characters obeying the same rules (TRSDOS 6 versions up to 6.2 support both owner and user passwords). Entire diskettes can also be assigned master passwords, which may limit user access via the BACKUP and PURGE commands.

Under TRSDOS and LDOS the system is never &quot;logged in&quot; to any current drive as with CP/M, PC DOS and MS-DOS. The system prompt is always . All file access requests (whether issued by the user at the console or a program being executed) are satisfied by searching the directory of the first drive specified (taken as drive zero if no drive number is given) and, if the requested file is not found, then searching the next (higher numbered) drive in the system. This continues until the file is found or all the drives in the system have been searched (but see below for variations on this rule). 

Drive numbers are specified with a colon followed immediately with the drive number. The colon is optional unless the drive specification is used as a suffix for a filename. Using the directory command as an example: 

* displays all files starting with logical drive zero, then drive one, and so on.
* or searches logical drive four (for all files, as always when no filename is given).
* or searches logical drives four, five, and six.
* or searches logical drives four, five, six and seven.
* searches for FILENAME on logical drive two.
* searches for FILENAME on all logical drives starting from drive two.

As seen, the dash character is used to specify a range of drive numbers. The and (catalog) commands display all file specifications (filespecs) matching the query on all drives. Other commands/utilities such as , and , and drive searches initiated by programs being executed, stop searching at the first drive found to match. If the same filespec exists on multiple drives, then those files on higher-numbered drives will be excluded. 

File access by partial filenames (partspecs), file extensions, and file dates are supported. For example:

* will select files SAMPLE, SAMPLE1, SAMPLE23 and SAMPLEIT.
* will select files SAMPLE/BAS, TEST/BAS, EXAMPLE/BAS, etc.

As with the example earlier, drive specifications (drivespecs) may be appended to filespecs. These examples assume the selected files have not be made invisible in the disk directory. File access requests issued by applications programs running under TRSDOS work the same way.

===Command-line interface===
Under TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x, the standard system command interpreter (SYS1/SYS) can be functionally replaced with a custom interpreter by copying the new interpreter to the system file SYS13/SYS (which in an unmodified installation is a dummy file). This can be any machine code /CMD program file. This is referred to in the documentation as an &quot;Extended Command Interpreter&quot; or ECI.

TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x support wildcard characters in filenames, both the single character ? and multicharacter *.

TRSDOS (version II) was notable for the inclusion of &quot;noise&quot; words, similar to the 1959 COBOL specification. These made commands more English-like. For example, the following commands functioned identically:
*
Since TRSDOS does not have the notion of &quot;redirection&quot; for disk files as UNIX/Linux and MS-DOS do, the APPEND command is somewhat different in concept than the UNIX or MS-DOS notion of appending via output redirection. TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x do provide I/O redirection for system devices (keyboard *KI, display screen *DO, printer *PR, serial port *CL), as well as for between devices and disk files. The DEVICE command displays a map of I/O links and routes.
Under DOS and UNIX printing a file can be done with redirection; under UNIX it is normally done by spooling the file to the &quot;line printer&quot; (using the &quot;lpr&quot; command) because UNIX is conventionally a multi-user system. TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x print jobs can be redirected (such as to a disk file) by applying the LINK or ROUTE commands to the system *PR device.

TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x do not support subdirectories or user areas. However, the DIR and CAT (Catalog) commands for displaying file data support the usual partial filenames, suffixes, and file dates.
Under TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x files can be made invisible to the DIR and CAT commands, and can be displayed with the INV parameter (unless any files are password protected and the correct p/w is not given).

TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.3 can dump the video screen to the line printer by pressing .

Many versions support a simple password security for files and programs, with separate Read/Execute and full access capabilities. ex: &quot;filename/ext.password:drive#&quot;. TRSDOS 6.x supports both Owner and User passwords (8 characters max) for disk files. LS-DOS 6.3 uses the space for the User password for its extended dating scheme (past December 31, 1987). Both Model 4 OSes can set various file access levels and permit software write protection for disk files and entire disks.

==== Commands ====
Although MS-DOS owes its heritage most closely to CP/M and thence to TOPS-10, many of the file manipulation commands are similar to those of TRSDOS. 
Some of the following TRSDOS commands exist on disk as distinct program files (DIR/CMD, FORMAT/CMD, BACKUP/CMD) while all others exist as modules condensed into the library files (technically Partitioned Data Sets or PDSs) SYS6/SYS, SYS7/SYS and SYS8/SYS; these include the TRSDOS commands CAT, COPY, LIST, REMOVE, RENAME etc.
Some typical TRSDOS utilities:

==Example code==
The following Z80 assembler source code is for a subroutine named . This is an introductory program which will print a message to the video display and then exit. Though simple, it demonstrates how an assembler source code is formatted and interacts with the display hardware through TRSDOS. The example uses TRS-80 Model 4 running TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x, produced by Tandy/Radio Shack and Logical Systems, with most any assembler sold by Radio Shack or Misosys Inc. (Series I/EDTASM, ALDS, EDAS or MRAS with switch).

<text>Thomas Dudley (12 October 157631 July 1653) was a New England colonial magistrate who served several terms as governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Dudley was the chief founder of Newtowne, later Cambridge, Massachusetts, and built the town&#x27;s first home. He provided land and funds to establish the Roxbury Latin School and signed Harvard College&#x27;s new charter during his 1650 term as governor. Dudley was a devout Puritan who opposed religious views not conforming with his. In this, he was more rigid than other early Massachusetts leaders like John Winthrop, but less confrontational than John Endecott.

The son of a military man who died when he was young, Dudley saw military service himself during the French Wars of Religion, and then acquired some legal training before entering the service of his likely kinsman, the Earl of Lincoln. Along with other Puritans in Lincoln&#x27;s circle, Dudley helped establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony, sailing with Winthrop in 1630. Although he served only four one-year terms as governor of the colony, he was regularly in other positions of authority.

Dudley&#x27;s daughter Anne Bradstreet (1612–1672) was a prominent early American poet. One of the gates of Harvard Yard, which existed from 1915 to 1947, was named in his honor, and Harvard&#x27;s Dudley House is named for the family, as is the town of Dudley, Massachusetts.

==Early years==
Thomas Dudley was born in Yardley Hastings, a village near Northampton, England, on 12 October 1576, to Roger and Susanna (Thorne) Dudley. The family has long asserted connections to the Sutton-Dudleys of Dudley Castle (Duke of Northumberland, Earls of Warwick and Leicester, Viscounts Lisle, and Barons Dudley); there is a similarity in their coats of arms, but association beyond probable common ancestry has not yet been conclusively demonstrated. Roger Dudley, a captain in the English army, was apparently killed in battle. It was for some time believed he was killed in the 1590 Battle of Ivry, but Susanna Dudley is known already to have been widowed by 1588. The 1586 battle of Zutphen has also been suggested as the occasion of Roger Dudley&#x27;s death.

Like many other young men of good birth Thomas Dudley became a page, in his case in the household of William, Baron Compton at nearby Castle Ashby. Later he raised a company of men following a call to arms by Queen Elizabeth, and served in the English army led by Sir Arthur Savage fighting with King Henry IV of France during the French Wars of Religion. He fought the Spanish at the Siege of Amiens in 1597, which in September surrendered and was the final action of the war.

After he was discharged from his military service, Dudley returned to Northamptonshire. He then entered the service of Sir Augustine Nicolls, a relative of his mother&#x27;s as a clerk. Nicolls, a lawyer and later a judge, was recognized for his honesty at a time when many judges were susceptible to bribery and other misconduct. He was also sympathetic to the Puritan cause; the exposure to legal affairs and Nicolls&#x27; religious views probably had a significant influence on Dudley. After Nicolls&#x27; sudden death in 1616, Dudley took a position with Theophilus Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln, serving as a steward responsible for managing some of the earl&#x27;s estates. Although there is a likely blood connection, the reason for the appointment may be that Dudley&#x27;s soldier grandfather Henry had served under Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. The earl&#x27;s estate in Lincolnshire was a center of Nonconformist thought, and Dudley was already recognized for his Puritan virtues by the time he entered the earl&#x27;s service. According to Cotton Mather&#x27;s biography of Dudley, he successfully disentangled a legacy of financial difficulties bequeathed to the earl, and the earl consequently came to depend on Dudley for financial advice. Dudley&#x27;s services were not entirely pecuniary in nature: he is also said to have had an important role in securing the engagement of Clinton to Lord Saye&#x27;s daughter. In 1622, Dudley acquired the assistance of Simon Bradstreet who was eventually drawn to Dudley&#x27;s daughter Anne. The two were married six years later when she was 16.

Dudley was briefly out of Lincoln&#x27;s service between about 1624 and 1628. During this time, he lived with his growing family in Boston, Lincolnshire, where he likely was a parishioner at St Botolph&#x27;s Church, where John Cotton preached. The Dudleys were known to be back on Lincoln&#x27;s estate in 1628 when his daughter Anne came down with smallpox and was treated there.

==Massachusetts Bay Colony==
In 1628 Dudley and other Puritans decided to form the Massachusetts Bay Company, with a view toward establishing a Puritan colony in North America. Dudley&#x27;s name does not appear on the land grant issued to the company that year. Still, he was almost certainly involved in the company&#x27;s formative stages, whose investors and supporters included many individuals in the Earl of Lincoln&#x27;s circle. The company sent a small group of colonists led by John Endecott to begin building a settlement, called Salem, on the shores of Massachusetts Bay; a second group was sent in 1629. The company acquired a royal charter in April 1629 and later that year made the critical decision to transport the charter and the company&#x27;s corporate governance to the colony. The Cambridge Agreement, which enabled the emigrating shareholders to buy out those that remained behind, may have been written by Dudley. In October 1629 John Winthrop was elected governor, and John Humphrey was chosen as his deputy. However, as the fleet was preparing to sail in March 1630, Humphrey decided he would not leave England immediately, and Dudley was chosen as deputy governor in his place.

Dudley and his family sailed for the New World on the &quot;Arbella&quot;, the flagship of the Winthrop Fleet, on 8 April 1630 and arrived in Salem Harbour on 12 June. Finding conditions at Salem inadequate for establishing a larger colony, Winthrop and Dudley led forays into the Charles River watershed, but were unable to immediately agree on a site for the capital. With limited time to establish themselves and concerns over rumors of potential hostile French action, the leaders decided to distribute the colonists in several places to avoid presenting a single target for hostilities. The Dudleys probably spent the winter of 1630–31 in Boston, which was where the leadership chose to stay after its first choice, Charlestown, was found to have inadequate water. A letter Dudley wrote to the Countess of Lincoln in March 1631 narrated the first year&#x27;s experience of the colonists that arrived in Winthrop&#x27;s fleet in an intimate tone befitting a son or suitor as much as a servant. It appeared in print for the first time in a 1696 compilation of early colonial documents by Joshua Scottow.

===Founding of Cambridge===

In the spring of 1631, the leadership agreed to establish the colony&#x27;s capital at Newtowne (near present-day Harvard Square in Cambridge), and the town was surveyed and laid out. Dudley, Simon Bradstreet, and others built their houses there, but to Dudley&#x27;s anger, Winthrop decided to build in Boston. This decision caused a rift between Dudley and Winthrop; it was severe enough that in 1632 Dudley resigned his posts and considered returning to England. After the mediation of others, the two reconciled, and Dudley retracted his resignation. Winthrop reported that &quot;[e]ver after they kept peace and good correspondency in love and friendship.&quot; During the dispute, Dudley also harshly questioned Winthrop&#x27;s authority as governor for several actions without consulting his council of assistants. Dudley&#x27;s differences with Winthrop came to the fore again in January 1636, when other magistrates orchestrated a series of accusations that Winthrop had been overly lenient in his judicial decisions.

In 1632 Dudley, at his own expense, erected a palisade around Newtowne (which was renamed Cambridge in 1636) that enclosed of land, principally as a defense against wild animals and Native American raids. The colony agreed to reimburse him by imposing taxes on all area communities. The meetings occasioned by this need are among the first instances of a truly representative government in North America, when each town chose two representatives to advise the governor on the subject. This principle was extended to govern the colony as a whole in 1634, the year Dudley was first elected governor. During this term, the colony established a committee to oversee military affairs and to manage the colony&#x27;s munitions.

The colony came under legal threat in 1632, when Sir Ferdinando Gorges, attempting to revive an earlier claim to the territory, raised issues of the colony&#x27;s charter and governance with the Privy Council of King Charles I. When the colony&#x27;s governing magistrates drafted a response to the charges raised by Gorges, Dudley was alone in opposing language, referring to the king as his &quot;sacred majesty&quot;, and to bishops of the Church of England as &quot;Reverend Bishops&quot;. Although a &quot;quo warranto&quot; writ was issued in 1635 calling for the charter to be returned to England, the king&#x27;s financial straits prevented it from being served, and the issue eventually died out.

===Anne Hutchinson affair===
In 1635, and for the four following years, Dudley was elected either as deputy governor or as a member of the council of assistants. The governor in 1636 was Henry Vane, and the colony was split over the actions of Anne Hutchinson. She had come to the colony in 1634 and began preaching a &quot;covenant of grace&quot; following her mentor, John Cotton, while most of the colony&#x27;s leadership, including Dudley, Winthrop, and most of the ministers, espoused a more Legalist view (&quot;covenant of works&quot;). This split divided the colony since Vane and Cotton supported her. At the end of this colonial strife, called the Antinomian Controversy, Hutchinson was banished from the colony, and a number of her followers left the colony as a consequence. She settled in Rhode Island, where Roger Williams, also &quot;persona non-grata&quot; in Massachusetts over theological differences, offered her shelter. Dudley&#x27;s role in the affair is unclear, but historians supportive of Hutchinson&#x27;s cause argue that he was a significant force in her banishment, and that he was unhappy that the colony did not adopt a more rigid stance or ban more of her followers.

Vane was turned out of office in 1637 over the Hutchinson affair and his insistence on flying the English flag over the colony&#x27;s fort; many Puritans felt that the Cross of St George on the flag was a symbol of popery and was thus anathema to them. Vane was replaced by Winthrop, who served three terms. According to Winthrop, concerns over the length of his service led to Dudley&#x27;s election as governor in 1640.

Although Dudley and Winthrop clashed with each other on several issues, they agreed on banning Hutchinson, and their relationship had some significant positive elements. In 1638 Dudley and Winthrop were each granted a tract of land &quot;about six miles from Concord, northward&quot;. Reportedly, Winthrop and Dudley went to the area together to survey the land and select their parcels. Winthrop, then governor, graciously deferred to Dudley, then deputy governor, to make the first choice of land. Dudley&#x27;s land became Billerica, and Winthrop&#x27;s Bedford. The place where the two properties met was marked by two large stones, each carved with the owner&#x27;s name; Winthrop described the spot as the &quot;&#x27;Two Brothers&#x27;, in remembrance that they were brothers by their children&#x27;s marriage&quot;.

===Other political activities===
During Dudley&#x27;s term of office in 1640, many new laws were passed. This led to the introduction the following year of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, a document that contains guarantees that were later placed in the United States Bill of Rights. During this term, he joined moderates, including John Winthrop, in opposing attempts by the local clergy to take a more prominent and explicit role in the colony&#x27;s governance. When he was again governor in 1645, the colony threatened war against the expansionist Narragansetts, who had been making war against the English-allied Mohegans. This prompted the Narragansett leader Miantonomi to sign a peace agreement with the New England colonies which lasted until King Philip&#x27;s War broke out 30 years later. Dudley also presided over the acquittal of John Winthrop in a trial held that year; Winthrop had been charged with abuses of his power as a magistrate by residents of Hingham the previous year.
In 1649 Dudley was appointed once again to serve as a commissioner and president of the New England Confederation, an umbrella organization established by most of the New England colonies to address issues of common interest; however, he was ill (and aging, at 73), and consequently unable to discharge his duties in that office. Dudley was elected governor for the fourth and last time in 1650 despite the illness. The most notable acts during this term were the issuance of a new charter for Harvard College, and the judicial decision to burn &quot;The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption&quot;, a book by Springfield resident William Pynchon that expounded on religious views heretical to the ruling Puritans. Pynchon was called upon to retract his views but returned to England instead of facing the magistrates.

During most of his years in Massachusetts, when not governor, Dudley served as either deputy governor or as one of the colony&#x27;s commissioners to the New England Confederation. He also served as a magistrate in the colonial courts, and sat on committees that drafted the laws of the colony. His views were conservative, but he was not as strident in them as John Endecott. Endecott notoriously defaced the English flag in 1632, an act for which he was censured and deprived of office for one year. Dudley sided with the moderate faction on the issue, which believed the flag&#x27;s depiction of the Cross of St George had by then been reduced to a symbol of nationalism.

Nathaniel Morton, an early chronicler of the Plymouth Colony, wrote of Dudley, &quot;His zeal to order appeared in contriving good laws, and faithfully executing them upon criminal offenders, heretics, and underminers of true religion. He had a piercing judgment to discover the wolf, though clothed with a sheepskin.&quot; Early Massachusetts historian James Savage wrote of Dudley that &quot;[a] hardness in public, and rigidity in private life, are too observable in his character&quot;. In a more modern historical view, Francis Bremer observes that Dudley was &quot;more precise and rigid than the moderate Winthrop in his approach to the issues facing the colonists&quot;.

===Founding of Harvard and Roxbury Latin===

In 1637, the colony established a committee &quot;to take order for a new college at Newtown&quot;. The committee consisted of most of the colony&#x27;s elders, including Dudley. In 1638, John Harvard, a childless colonist, bequeathed to the colony his library and half of his estate as a contribution to the college, which was consequently named in his honor. The college charter was first issued in 1642, and a second charter was issued in 1650, signed by then-Governor Thomas Dudley, who also served for many years as one of the college&#x27;s overseers. Harvard University&#x27;s Dudley House, now only an administrative unit located in Lehman Hall after the actual house was torn down, is named in honor of the Dudley family. Harvard Yard once had a Dudley Gate bearing words written by his daughter Anne; it was torn down in the 1940s to make way for construction of Lamont Library. A fragment remains in Dudley Garden, behind Lamont Library, including a lengthy inscription in stone.

In 1643, Reverend John Eliot established a school at Roxbury. Dudley, who was then living in Roxbury, gave significant donations of both land and money to the school, which survives to this day as the Roxbury Latin School.

==Family and legacy==
Dudley married Dorothy Yorke in 1603 and had five or six children. Samuel, the first, also came to the New World and married Winthrop&#x27;s daughter Mary in 1633, the first of several alliances of the Dudley-Winthrop family. He later served as the pastor in Exeter, New Hampshire. Daughter Anne married Simon Bradstreet, and became the first poet published in North America. Patience, Dudley&#x27;s third child, married a colonial militia officer Daniel Denison. The fourth child, Sarah, married Benjamin Keayne, a militia officer. This union was unhappy, resulting in the first reported instance of divorce in the colony; Keayne returned to England and repudiated the marriage. Although no formal divorce proceedings are known, Sarah eventually married again, to Job Judkins, by whom she bore five children. Mercy, the last of his children with Dorothy, married minister John Woodbridge.

Dudley may have had another son, though most historians think the evidence is too slim. A “Thomas Dudley” was awarded degrees from Emmanuel College, Cambridge University, in 1626 and 1630, and some historians have argued this is a son of Dudley. Also, Dudley was referred to as “Thomas Dudley Senior” on a lone occasion in 1637.

Dorothy Yorke died on 27 December 1643 at 61 years of age, and was remembered by her daughter Anne in a poem:

Dudley married his second wife, the widow Katherine (Deighton) Hackburne, a descendant of the noble Berkeley, Lygon, and Beauchamp families, in 1644. She is also a direct descendant of eleven of the twenty-five barons who acted as sureties for John Lackland on the Magna Carta. They had three children, Deborah, Joseph, and Paul. Joseph served as governor of the Dominion of New England and of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Paul (not to be confused with Joseph&#x27;s son Paul, who served as provincial attorney general) was for a time the colony&#x27;s register of probate.

In 1636, Dudley moved from Cambridge to Ipswich, and in 1639, moved to Roxbury. He died in Roxbury on 31 July 1653, and was buried in the Eliot Burying Ground there. Dudley, Massachusetts is named for his grandsons Paul and William, its first proprietors.

The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation owns a parcel of land in Billerica called Governor Thomas Dudley Park. The &quot;Two Brothers&quot; rocks are located in the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in Bedford, in an area that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Two Brothers Rocks-Dudley Road Historic District.
===Dudley Square===
Dudley Square in Boston&#x27;s Roxbury neighborhood was named after Dudley. Proponents of an effort to rename the square noted that Dudley was &quot;a leading politician in 1641&quot;, when the colony became the first to sanction slavery legally. Conversely, Byron Rushing, former president of the Museum of African American History in Boston, stated, “I’ve really searched, and I’ve found no evidence that Dudley ever owned slaves.&quot;

A non-binding advisory question was added to the 5 November 2019 municipal ballot for all Boston residents asking, &quot;Do you support the renaming/changing of the name of Dudley Square to Nubian Square?&quot; Election night results show that the question was defeated.

Mayor of Boston Marty Walsh subsequently announced that the question had &quot;passed in the surrounding areas&quot; near the square, and could be considered further by the city&#x27;s Public Improvement Commission. On 19 December 2019, the Public Improvement Commission unanimously approved changing the name of Dudley Square to Nubian Square. Dudley station was renamed Nubian station in June 2020.

<text>The Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont and are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately from the border with Massachusetts to the border with Quebec, Canada. The part of the same range that is in Massachusetts and Connecticut is known as The Berkshires or the Berkshire Hills (with the Connecticut portion, mostly in Litchfield County, locally called the Northwest Hills or Litchfield Hills) and the Quebec portion is called the Sutton Mountains, or &quot;&quot; in French.

All mountains in Vermont are often referred to as the &quot;Green Mountains&quot;. However, other ranges within Vermont, including the Taconic Mountains in southwestern Vermont and the Northeastern Highlands, are not geologically part of the Green Mountains.

==Peaks==

The best-known mountains—for reasons such as high elevation, ease of public access by road or trail (especially the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail), or with ski resorts or towns nearby—in the range include:

# Mount Mansfield, , the highest point in Vermont
# Killington Peak, 
# Camel&#x27;s Hump, 
# Mount Ellen, 
# Mount Abraham, 
# Pico Peak, 
# Stratton Mountain, 
# Jay Peak, , receives the most snowfall on average in the eastern United States.
# Bread Loaf Mountain, 
# Mount Wilson, 
# Glastenbury Mountain, 
# Burke Mountain, 

The Green Mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountains, a range that stretches from Quebec in the north to Alabama in the south. The Green Mountains are part of the New England/Acadian forests ecoregion.

Three peaks—Mount Mansfield, Camel&#x27;s Hump, and Mount Abraham—support alpine vegetation.

==Tourism==
Some of the mountains are developed for skiing and other snow-related activities. Others have hiking trails for use in summer. Mansfield, Killington, Pico, and Ellen have downhill ski resorts on their slopes. All of the major peaks are traversed by the Long Trail, a wilderness hiking trail that runs from the southern to northern borders of the state and is overlapped by the Appalachian Trail for roughly of its length.

==History==
The Vermont Republic, also known as the Green Mountain Republic, existed from 1777 to 1791, at which time Vermont became the 14th state.

Vermont not only takes its state nickname (&quot;The Green Mountain State&quot;) from the mountains, it is named after them. The French &quot;Monts Verts&quot; or &quot;Verts Monts&quot; is literally translated as &quot;Green Mountains&quot;. This name was suggested in 1777 by Dr. Thomas Young, an American revolutionary and Boston Tea Party participant. The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College is referred to as UVM, after the Latin &quot;Universitas Viridis Montis&quot; (University of the Green Mountains).

==Geology and physiography==

The Green Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division.

<doc id="521035" wikidata="Q301482" url="?curid=521035" title="Richthofen family">
<text>The Richthofen family is an old and prominent German noble family, whose members held the title of Baron in Bohemia and Count in the Kingdom of Prussia. The most famous member is the air ace Manfred von Richthofen (1892–1918), also known as the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, but a number of other members of his family are also notable for various reasons.

== Walter von Richthofen ==
Baron Walter von Richthofen, an uncle of Manfred von Richthofen, immigrated to the United States in 1877 from Silesia. He founded the Denver Chamber of Commerce and was co-founder of Montclair, Denver, at that time a village east of Denver but now incorporated into the city. His Richthofen Castle was one of the most sumptuous mansions in the American West. Begun in 1883 and completed in 1887, it was modeled on the original Richthofen Castle in Germany. Located immediately around the castle are the baron&#x27;s mistress&#x27;s house and his sanitarium/dairy.

== WWI flying aces ==

Manfred von Richthofen was the most successful fighter pilot of World War I, with 80 official victories before he was killed in action.

His younger brother, Lothar von Richthofen (1894–1922), was also a flying ace, with 40 victories. He served alongside his brother in Jasta 11. Lothar died in an air crash in 1922.

The two aviators were fourth cousins of the German World War II field marshal Wolfram von Richthofen (1895–1945). Wolfram was a cavalry man and later a World War I flying ace who flew with Manfred and Lothar in Jagdgeschwader 1 during the last year of the war.

== Frieda and Else von Richthofen ==
Frieda von Richthofen (1879–1956), who married the English novelist D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930) in July 1914, was a distant cousin. Though their last common ancestor was born in 1661, the Red Baron&#x27;s fame nonetheless attached to Frieda&#x27;s reputation in war time England.

Frieda&#x27;s sister Else von Richthofen was one of the earliest female social scientists in Germany.

== Suzane Louise von Richthofen ==
Suzane Louise von Richthofen (born 3 November 1983) is a Brazilian woman who was convicted of murdering her parents on 31 October 2002 with the help of her boyfriend and his brother. She was put on trial in São Paulo in July 2006 and was sentenced to 39 years and 6 months in prison. In 2023 she was released from prison on parole.

==Ambassadors==
* Herbert von Richthofen was an ambassador to Bulgaria between 1938 and 1941.
* Dr. Hermann von Richthofen (grand-nephew of Frieda and Else), was German Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1989–1993, where his name made him a media favorite.

==Other==
Other well-known family members include:
*Bolko von Richthofen (1899–1983), German archaeologist (not to be confused with Manfred&#x27;s younger brother)
*Emil von Richthofen (1810-1895), Prussian diplomat and father of Oswald von Richthofen
*Ferdinand von Richthofen (1833–1905), German traveller, geographer and scientist, for whom Colorado&#x27;s Mount Richthofen was named
*Manfred von Richthofen (general) (1855–1939), German General of the Cavalry during World War I
*Manfred von Richthofen (sports official) (1934–2014), German hockey player and coach
*Oswald von Richthofen (1847-1906), German diplomat and politician

<text>A registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) (), or retirement savings plan (RSP), is a Canadian financial account intended to provide retirement income, but accessible at any time. RRSPs reduce taxes compared to normally taxed accounts. They were introduced in 1957 to promote savings by employees and self-employed people.

They must comply with a variety of restrictions stipulated in the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;. Qualified investments include savings accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), bonds, mortgage loans, mutual funds, income trusts, common and preferred shares listed on a designated stock exchange, exchange-traded funds, call and put options listed on a designated stock exchange, foreign currency, and labour-sponsored funds. Short call contracts covered by long stock (&quot;covered calls&quot;) are eligible, however, cash secured puts (short put contracts covered by cash) are not eligible. Rules determine the maximum contributions, the timing of contributions, the assets allowed, and the eventual conversion to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF), or an annuity, or the withdrawal of all funds within the RRSP, at age 71.

==Taxation==
Contributions to RRSPs are deductible from income, reducing income tax payable for the year in which the contributions are claimed. The holder of the RRSP (the &quot;annuitant&quot;) can defer the deduction due to the contribution to a later year.

Taxable income of qualified investments of the trust is not taxed, as set out in section 146(4) of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;. 

If the RRSP earns business income, the business income is subject to taxation on the basis of the business income less the amount of business income arising from the sale of qualified investments. The effect of this rule, set out in section 146(4)(b)(i) and (ii) of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;, is that business income on qualified investments, earned within an RRSP, is subject to zero tax while the income remains within the RRSP. This means that business income, for example, due to day trading within the RRSP, is not taxed, so long as the business income is due entirely to the sale of qualified investments. This is an important tax carve-out unique among registered accounts to the RRSP and the Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), as, for example, in the case of the Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA), business income is taxable as personal income earned by the TFSA holder. 

All withdrawals except for withdrawals due to participation in the Home Buyers&#x27; Plan and the Lifelong Learning Plan are taxed as income when they are withdrawn. This is the same tax treatment provided to Registered Pension Plans established by employers. Preliminary tax may be withheld at withdrawal.
RRSP accounts can be set up with either one or two associated individuals:

*Individual RRSP: an individual RRSP is associated with only a single person, called an account holder. With Individual RRSPs, the account holder is also called a contributor, as only they contribute money to their RRSP.
*Spousal RRSP: a spousal RRSP allows a higher earner, called a spousal contributor, to contribute to an RRSP in their spouse&#x27;s name. In this case, it is the spouse who is the account holder. The spouse can withdraw the funds, subject to tax, after a holding period. A spousal RRSP is a means of splitting income in retirement: By dividing investment properties between both spouses each spouse will receive half the income, and thus the marginal tax rate will be lower than if one spouse earned all of the income.
*Group RRSP: in a group RRSP, an employer arranges for employees to make contributions, as they wish, through a schedule of regular payroll deductions. The employee can decide the size of contribution per year and the employer will deduct an amount accordingly and submit it to the investment manager selected to administer the group account. The contribution is then deposited into the employee’s individual account and invested as specified. The primary benefit with a group plan is that the employee-contributor realizes the tax savings immediately, because the income taxes his or her employer must deduct on every paycheque can be reduced. By contrast, if a taxpayer making a private contribution is not expecting to owe more than $3,000 ($1,800 in Quebec) at the end of the year, then he or she will have to wait until the end of the tax year (or even not until after that in the case of taxpayers expecting a refund) before realizing the benefit.
*Pooled RRSP: legislation was introduced during the 41st Canadian parliament in 2011 to create pooled retirement pension plans (PRPP). PRPPs would be aimed at employees and employers in small businesses, and at self-employed people.

==Benefits from tax savings==
There are a few benefit factors that add to a total. The only benefit that everyone always gets is from permanently tax-free profits on after-tax savings. This is the same and equal benefit as from a TFSA. The conceptual understanding is that the contribution&#x27;s tax reduction is the government investing its money alongside the saver&#x27;s, for him to invest as he likes. They become co-owners of the account. The government&#x27;s share of the account (funding plus the tax-free profits earned by it) at withdrawal fully funds the account&#x27;s withdrawal tax calculated at the contribution&#x27;s tax rate. So the contribution&#x27;s tax reduction is never a benefit, and profits are never taxed. The withdrawal tax is conceptually an allocation of principal between owners, not a &#x27;tax&#x27;, and there is no benefit &#x27;from deferral&#x27;.
There is a possible bonus (or penalty) from withdrawal tax rates lower (or higher) than at contribution. Both are possibilities. It equals the dollars withdrawn multiplied by the difference in tax rates. Hopefully the rate will be lower in retirement for a benefit. The tax rates used for this calculation are the effective rates that include the impact of the RRSP contributions / withdrawals on the qualification for benefits from other income-tested programs.

There is a growing cost from any delay in claiming the contribution&#x27;s tax refund. 

Example: Taxpayer has a 30% combined federal-provincial marginal income tax rate and makes a $10,000 contribution to a registered account. Assume in this example that the taxpayer&#x27;s marginal income tax rate is the same at time of withdrawal from the registered account as it was at the time of contribution: 

To TFSA: 

$10,000 - $3,000 in income tax paid = $7,000 to contribute to TFSA as the contribution to TFSA is with after-tax income. 

$7,000 invested in TFSA. After 10 years, say the $7,000 has grown to $14,000. 

Taxpayer withdraws $14,000, tax-free. 

To RRSP: 

$10,000 invested in RRSP as the contribution to RRSP is with pre-tax income. 

After 10 years, say the $10,000 has grown to $20,000. 

Taxpayer pays 30% tax on withdrawal, or 30% of $20,000 = $6,000. 

Withdrawal net of tax = $20,000 - $6,000 = $14,000. 

It is clear from the example, above, that so long as the taxpayer&#x27;s marginal income tax rate does not change, the TFSA and RRSP produce the same results. 

It is also clear that the TFSA will be advantageous to the RRSP if the taxpayer&#x27;s marginal income tax rate is higher at the time of withdrawal than at the time of contribution. 

It is also clear that the RRSP will be advantageous to the TFSA if the taxpayer&#x27;s marginal income tax rate is lower at the time of withdrawal than at the time of contribution. 

Additional benefits may result from drawing funds using the Home Buyers&#x27; Plan or the Lifelong Learning Plan.

==Contributing==
Any resident of Canada who filed a tax return for the year prior to the year of the contribution, can contribute to an RRSP, up until December 31 of the year in which the RRSP annuitant (holder) turns 71. Contributions and deductions are two different things. Contributions are usually deducted from taxable income in the same tax year but may be deferred by the annuitant to future years. Because Canada has a progressive tax system, taxes are reduced at the individual&#x27;s highest marginal rate. For individuals who always claim the same deduction amount as their yearly contribution, their maximum contribution is the &#x27;deduction limit&#x27; calculated by the Canada Revenue Agency.

The &#x27;deduction limit&#x27; is a running total calculated for the next year and printed on every notice of assessment or reassessment, provided the taxpayer is aged 71 years or younger. It is reduced by tax deductions claimed and increased by the year&#x27;s contribution limit, minus any pension adjustment (PA) and past service pension adjustment (PSPA), plus pension adjustment reversals (PAR).

Since 1991, contribution limits are calculated at 18% of the prior year&#x27;s reported earned income (from employment or self-employment), up to a maximum. The maximum has been rising as shown in the table below. Since 2010 it is indexed to the annual increase in the average wage.

While it is possible to contribute more than the contributor&#x27;s deduction limit, it is generally not advised as any amount $2,000 over the deduction limit is subject to a significant penalty tax removing all benefits (1% per month on the overage amount).

RRSP contributions can be made up until and including the 60th day following December 31 of the tax year of the contribution. For example, contributions for the 2023 tax year can be made up until and including February 29, 2024. Unused contributions carry forward until December 31 in the year the annuitant reaches 71 years of age, at which point the unused contributions are cancelled. 

Prior to 1991, contribution limits were calculated at 20% of the prior year&#x27;s reported earned income, up to a maximum of $7,500 for taxfilers without an employer-sponsored registered pension plan, or $3,500 for taxfilers who had an employer-sponsored registered pension plan. Furthermore, any unused portion of the contribution limit could not be held for future use, and was therefore lost forever if not contributed before the 60 first days of the year.

==Withdrawals==
An account holder is able to withdraw dollars or assets from an RRSP at any age. Withholding tax is deducted by the institution managing the account. Amounts withdrawn must be included in the taxable income of that year. The tax withheld reduces the taxes owing at year end. There are two exceptions to this process: the Home Buyers&#x27; Plan and the Lifelong Learning Plan.

Before the end of the year the account holder turns 71, the RRSP must either be cashed out or transferred to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) or an annuity. Until 2007, account holders were required to make this decision at age 69 rather than 71.

Investments held in a RRIF continue to grow tax-free, though an obligatory minimum RRIF withdrawal amount is cashed out and sent to the account holder each year. 

On death the assets remaining in the account are withdrawn and distributed directly to the named beneficiary. They do not flow through the estate. The account is closed. Like other withdrawals, the value of the assets is included in the taxable income of the account&#x27;s owner. This large lump sum may result in much of its value being taxed at the top tax bracket. The liability to pay the tax lies with the estate, no matter who received the account&#x27;s assets.

There are exceptions. When a spouse is the named beneficiary, the account continues, without triggering taxes, in the name of the spouse. There are also provisions for the tax-free transfer of assets to minor children, grandchildren and dependents.

==Special withdrawal programs==

===Home buyers&#x27; plan===

While the original purpose of RRSPs was to help Canadians save for retirement, it is possible to use RRSP funds to help purchase one&#x27;s first home under what is known as the Home Buyers&#x27; Plan (HBP). An RRSP holder can borrow, tax-free, up to $35,000 from their RRSP (and another $35,000 from a spousal RRSP) towards buying their residence. This loan has to be repaid within 15 years after two years of grace. Contrary to popular belief, this plan can be used more than once per lifetime, as long as the borrower did not own a residence in the previous five years, and has fully repaid any previous loans under this plan. Originally introduced in the 1992 federal budget, the initial amount that could be borrowed was $15,000. Seventeen years later the amount was raised to $25,000 in the 2009 budget. The 2019 budget raised that amount again to $35,000.

===Lifelong learning plan===

Similarly to the home buyers&#x27; plan, the Life-Long Learning Plan (LLP) allows for temporary diversions of tax-free funds from an RRSP. This program allows individuals to borrow from an RRSP to go or return to post-secondary school. The user may withdraw up to $10,000 per year to a maximum of $20,000. The first repayment under the LLP will be due at the earliest of the following two dates.

#60 days after the fifth year following the first withdrawal
#the second year after the last year the student was enrolled in full-time studies

==Account structure==

Both individual and spousal RRSPs can be held in one of three account structures. One or more of the account types below may not be an option depending on what type of investment instrument (example stocks, mutual funds, bonds) is being held inside the RRSP.

===Client-held accounts===

Client-held, or client-name accounts, exist when an account holder uses their RRSP contributions to purchase an investment with a particular investment company. Each time that an individual uses RRSP contribution money to purchase an investment at a different fund company, it results in a separate client-held account being opened. For example, if an individual buys investment #1 with one company and investment #2 with another, the individual would have separate RRSP accounts held with two different companies.

The main benefits of client-name accounts is that they do not generally incur annual fees or &quot;exit fees&quot;, the investment is registered with the trustee in the client&#x27;s name instead of the &quot;dealer&#x27;s&quot; name and therefore, client-name investments are not subject to bankruptcy issues if the dealer goes bankrupt. Another benefit is that a Dealer Statement generated quarterly by the Mutual Fund Dealer; and Exempt Market Dealer contain all investment activity (buy, sell, switch) through that dealer for ease of tracking investments. The Dealer Statement contains all types of plans for registered investments (RRSP, RRIF, Tax-Free Savings Account, Locked-in Retirement Account, Life Income Fund) and non-registered investments thereby making it easy to track investments in one place.

Generally, client-held accounts are for mutual funds and exempt products only; therefore, if an investor holds stocks and bonds along with mutual funds or exempt products, a Nominee or Intermediary account is most beneficial for ease of tracking all types of investments in one place.

===Nominee accounts===

Nominee accounts are so named because individuals with this type of account nominate a nominee, usually one of Canada&#x27;s five major banks or a major investment dealer, to hold a number of different investments in a single account. For example, if an individual buys investment #1 with one company and investment #2 with another, both investments are held in a single RRSP account with the nominee, a chartered bank.

The main benefit of a nominee account is the ability to keep track of all RRSP investments within a single account. The main detriment is that nominee accounts often incur annual fees.

A &quot;self-directed&quot; RRSP (SDRSP) is a special kind of nominee account. It is essentially a trading account at a brokerage that has tax-sheltered status. The holder of a self-directed RRSP instructs the brokerage to buy and sell securities on their behalf as with any brokerage account. The reason that it is described as &quot;self-directed&quot; is that the holder of this kind of RRSP directs all the investment decisions themselves, and does not normally have the service of an investment advisor.

===Intermediary accounts===

Intermediary accounts are essentially identical in function to nominee accounts. The reason investors would have an intermediary account instead of a nominee account has to do with the investment advisor they deal with, as advisors not aligned with a major bank or investment dealer may not have the logistical ability to offer nominee accounts to their clients.

As a result, the advisor will approach an intermediary company which is able to offer the investor identical benefits as those offered by a nominee account. The two main Canadian financial institutions that offer intermediary services are B2B Bank and Canadian Western Trust.

The main benefits and detriments of intermediary accounts are identical as those offered by nominee accounts.

==RRSP rollover==

It is possible to have an RRSP roll over to an adult dependent survivor, child or grandchild, as it would to a spouse. This was made possible in 2003 and there are various&quot; Income Tax Act&quot; (ITA) requirements to allow this to take place. The new registered asset could result in provincial benefits being cut off. In many cases a court application to have someone appointed guardian of the child’s property and person would be necessary to provide a legally authorized party to manage the asset if the child is deemed incompetent to do so. This possibility affects the overall estate plan and often the distribution of the estate.

Acquiring this asset may also affect the adult dependent child&#x27;s eligibility for provincial assistance programs. A Henson trust may be useful for enabling the adult dependent child to receive RRSP rollovers and still be eligible for provincial social assistance programs such as Ontario disability support program (ODSP). A lifetime benefit trust (LBT) is a new option that may be valuable for leaving a personal trust in a will for a special needs, financially dependent child, grandchild or spouse. It has the added benefit that RRSP assets dedicated to the LBT could be protected from creditors.

==Foreign content==

Originally, RRSPs were limited to mostly domestic content, that is, Canadian based investments such as GICs, bonds and shares of Canadian corporations, and mutual funds holding such assets. Non-Canadian content was limited to 10% of the plan&#x27;s assets, originally measured by market value, and in 1971 changed to 10% of book value.

In 1994, the foreign content limit was raised to 20%. However, by then, mutual fund managers found a way to get around this limitation and offer unitholders exposure to foreign markets without using up any of the foreign content quota. They typically did this by holding all fund assets in Canadian treasury bills or similar cash equivalent assets, and using foreign equity index futures or forward contracts with a similar notional value to obtain equivalent market exposure. 

In 2001, the foreign content limit was raised yet again, this time to 30%, but the prevalence of synthetic foreign funds was such as to make the limit a matter of form only.

In 2005, the law was changed to remove foreign content limit altogether.

Chagnon was known for his long-term ethnographic field work among the Yanomamö, a society of indigenous tribal Amazonians, in which he used an evolutionary approach to understand social behavior in terms of genetic relatedness. His work centered on the analysis of violence among tribal peoples, and, using socio-biological analyses, he advanced the argument that violence among the Yanomami is fueled by an evolutionary process in which successful warriors have more offspring. His 1967 ethnography &quot;Yanomamö: The Fierce People&quot; became a bestseller and is frequently assigned in introductory anthropology courses.

Admirers described him as a pioneer of scientific anthropology. Chagnon was called the &quot;most controversial anthropologist&quot; in the United States in a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; profile preceding the publication of Chagnon&#x27;s most recent book, a memoir titled &quot;Noble Savages: My Life Among Two Dangerous Tribes—the Yanomamö and the Anthropologists&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Chagnon was born in Port Austin, Michigan, and was the second of twelve children. After enrolling at the Michigan College of Mining and Technology in 1957, he transferred to the University of Michigan after his first year and there received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1961, an M.A. in 1963, and a Ph.D. in 1966 under the tutelage of Leslie White. Based on seventeen months of fieldwork begun in 1964, Chagnon&#x27;s thesis examined the relationship between kinship and the social organization of Yanomamö villages.

==Career==
Chagnon was best known for his long-term ethnographic field work among the Yanomamö, indigenous Amazonians who live in the border area between Venezuela and Brazil. Working primarily in the headwaters of the upper Siapa and upper Mavaca Rivers in Venezuela, he conducted fieldwork from the mid-1960s until the latter half of the 1990s. According to Chagnon, when he arrived he realised that the theories he had been taught during his training had shortcomings, because contrary to what they predicted, raiding and fighting, often over women, was endemic. His habit of constantly asking them questions earned Chagnon the Yanomamö nickname &quot;pesky bee.&quot; A major focus of his research was the collection of genealogies of the residents of the villages he visited, and from these he would analyze patterns of relatedness, marriage patterns, cooperation, and settlement pattern histories. The degree of kinship was seen by Chagnon as important for the forming of alliances in social interactions, including conflict.

Chagnon&#x27;s methods of analysis are widely seen as having been influenced by sociobiology. As Chagnon described it, Yanomamö society produced fierceness, because that behavior furthered male reproductive success. The genealogies showed that men who killed had more wives and children than men who did not kill. At the level of the villages, the war-like populations expanded at the expense of their neighbors. Chagnon&#x27;s positing of a link between reproductive success and violence cast doubt on the sociocultural perspective that cultures are constructed from human experience. An enduring controversy over Chagnon&#x27;s work has been described as a microcosm of the conflict between biological and sociocultural anthropology.

Chagnon&#x27;s ethnography, &quot;Yanomamö: The Fierce People&quot;, was published in 1968 and ran to several editions, selling nearly a million copies. It is commonly used as a text in university-level introductory anthropology classes, making it one of the bestselling anthropological texts of all time. Chagnon was also a pioneer in the field of visual anthropology. He collaborated with ethnographic filmmaker Tim Asch and produced a series of more than twenty ethnographic films documenting Yanomamö life. The ethnographic film &quot;The Ax Fight&quot;, showing a fight among two Yanomami groups and analyzing it as it relates to kinship networks, is considered a classic in ethnographic film making.

In 2012 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Marshall Sahlins, who was a major critic of Chagnon, resigned from the academy, citing Chagnon&#x27;s induction as one of the reasons he quit.

On 21 September 2019, Chagnon died at the age of 81.

==Controversies==

===&quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot;===
In 2000, Patrick Tierney, in his book &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot;, accused Chagnon and his colleague James V. Neel of unethical behavior, such as, among other things, manipulating data, and exacerbating a measles epidemic among the Yanomamö people.

Most of the allegations made in &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot; were publicly rejected by the Provost&#x27;s office of the University of Michigan in November 2000. For example, the interviews upon which the book was based all came from members of the Salesians of Don Bosco, a congregation of the Catholic Church, which Chagnon had criticized and angered.

The American Anthropological Association convened a task force in February 2001 to investigate some of the allegations made in Tierney&#x27;s book. Their report, which was issued by the AAA in May 2002, held that Chagnon had both represented the Yanomamö in harmful ways and failed in some instances to obtain proper consent from both the government and the groups he studied. However, the Task Force stated that there was no support for the claim that Chagnon and Neel began a measles epidemic. In June 2005, however, the AAA voted two-to-one to rescind the acceptance of the 2002 report.

Alice Dreger, a historian of medicine and science, concluded after a year&#x27;s research that Tierney&#x27;s claims were false and the American Anthropological Association was complicit and irresponsible in helping spread these falsehoods and not protecting &quot;scholars from baseless and sensationalistic charges&quot;.

The controversy is covered in the 2005 book &quot;Yanomami: The Fierce Controversy and What We Can Learn from It&quot; by anthropologist Robert Borofsky.

===Anthropological critiques of his work===
Chagnon&#x27;s work with the Yanomamö was widely criticized by other anthropologists. Anthropologists critiqued both aspects of his research methods as well as the theoretical approach, and the interpretations and conclusions he drew from his data. Most controversial was his claim that Yanomamö society is particularly violent, and his claim that this feature of their culture is grounded in biological differences that are the result of natural selection.

The anthropologist Brian Ferguson argued that Yanomamö culture is not particularly violent, and that the violence that does exist is largely a result of socio-political reconfigurations of their society under the influence of colonization. Bruce Albert rejected the statistical basis for his claims that more violent Yanomamö men have more children. Others questioned the ethics inherent in painting an ethnic group as violent savages, pointing out that Chagnon&#x27;s depiction of the Yanomamö as such breaks with anthropology&#x27;s traditional ethics of trying to describe foreign societies sympathetically, and argued that his depictions resulted in increased hostility and racism against the Yanomamö by settlers and colonists in the area. Emily Eakin countered that Albert &quot;cannot demonstrate a direct connection between Chagnon&#x27;s writings and the government&#x27;s Indian policy&quot; and that the idea that scientists should suppress unflattering information about their subjects is troubling and supports the idea that nonviolence is a prerequisite for protecting the Yanomamö.

The anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, one of Chagnon&#x27;s graduate teachers, criticized Chagnon&#x27;s methods, pointing out that Chagnon acknowledged engaging in behavior that was disagreeable to his informants by not participating in food-sharing obligations. Sahlins claimed that Chagnon&#x27;s trade of steel weaponry for blood samples and genealogical information amounted to &quot;participant-instigation&quot; which encouraged economic competition and violence. Lastly, Sahlins argued that Chagnon&#x27;s publications, which contend that violent Yanomamö men are conferred with reproductive advantages, made false assumptions in designating killers and omit other variables that explain reproductive success. In 2013, Sahlins resigned from the National Academy of Sciences, in part in protest of Chagnon&#x27;s election to the body. Other researchers of the Yanomamö such as Brian Ferguson argued that Chagnon himself contributed to escalating violence among the Yanomamö by offering machetes, axes, and shotguns to selected groups to elicit their cooperation. Chagnon said that it was instead local Salesian priests who were supplying guns to the Yanomamö, who then used them to kill each other.

In his autobiography, Chagnon stated that most criticisms of his work were based on a postmodern and antiscientific ideology that arose within anthropology, in which careful study of isolated tribes was replaced in many cases by explicit political advocacy that denied less pleasant aspects of the Yanomamö culture, such as warfare, domestic violence, and infanticide. Chagnon stated that much of his work has undermined the idea of the &#x27;Noble savage&#x27; – a romanticized stereotype of indigenous people living in synchrony with nature and uncorrupted by modern civilization. Chagnon also stated that his beliefs about sociobiology and kin selection were misinterpreted and misunderstood, similarly because of a rejection of scientific and biological explanations for culture within anthropology.

As a result of the controversy and the alleged unethical practices with the Yanomami, Chagnon was officially barred from studying the Yanomami and from reentering their country in Venezuela.

==Film==
Chagnon worked with ethnographic filmmaker Tim Asch to produce at least forty films on Yanomamo culture, including &quot;The Feast&quot; (1969), &quot;Magical Death&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Ax Fight&quot; (1975). These films, especially &quot;The Ax Fight&quot;, are widely used in anthropological and visual culture curriculum and are considered to be among the most important ethnographic films ever produced.

<doc id="521047" wikidata="Q386615" url="?curid=521047" title="Cocos plate">
<text>The Cocos plate is a young oceanic tectonic plate beneath the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Central America, named for Cocos Island, which rides upon it. The Cocos plate was created approximately 23 million years ago when the Farallon plate broke into two pieces, which also created the Nazca plate. The Cocos plate also broke into two pieces, creating the small Rivera plate. The Cocos plate is bounded to the northeast by the North American plate and the Caribbean plate. To the west it is bounded by the Pacific plate and to the south by the Nazca plate.

The only land above water on the Cocos plate is Cocos Island, which is administered by Costa Rica and lies approximately 550 km (342 mi; 297 nmi) southwest of the Costa Rican mainland.

==Geology==
The Cocos plate was created by sea floor spreading along the East Pacific Rise and the Cocos Ridge, specifically in a complicated area geologists call the Cocos-Nazca spreading system. From the rise the plate is pushed eastward and pushed or dragged (perhaps both) under the less dense Caribbean plate, in the process called subduction. The subducted leading edge heats up and adds its water to the mantle above it. In the mantle layer called the asthenosphere, mantle rock melts to make magma, trapping superheated water under great pressure. As a result, to the northeast of the subducting edge lies the continuous arc of volcanos – also known as the Central America Volcanic Arc – stretching from Costa Rica to Guatemala, and a belt of earthquakes that extends farther north, into Mexico.

The northern boundary of the Cocos plate is the Middle America Trench. The eastern boundary is a transform fault, the Panama fracture zone. The southern boundary is a mid-oceanic ridge, the Cocos–Nazca spreading centre. The western boundary is another mid-ocean ridge, the East Pacific Rise.

A hotspot under the Galápagos Islands lies along the Galápagos Rise. (&quot;see&quot; Galápagos hotspot and Galápagos microplate)

The Rivera plate, north of the Cocos plate, is thought to have separated from the Cocos plate 5–10 million years ago. The boundary between the two plates appears to lack a definite transform fault, yet they are regarded as distinct. After its separation from the Cocos plate, the Rivera plate started acting as an independent microplate.

The devastating 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the 2017 Chiapas earthquake were results of the subduction of the Cocos plate beneath the North American plate. The devastating El Salvador earthquakes in January 2001 and February 2001 were generated by the subduction of this plate beneath the Caribbean plate.

<text>Hippolyte Bayard (; 20 January 1801 – 14 May 1887) was a French photographer and pioneer in the history of photography. He invented his own process that produced direct positive paper prints in the camera and presented the world&#x27;s first public exhibition of photographs on 24 June 1839. He claimed to have invented photography earlier than Louis-Jacques Mandé Daguerre in France and William Henry Fox Talbot in England, the men traditionally credited with its invention.

Bayard experimented with the new medium taking photos of plant specimens, statuary (including posing with them for self-portraits), street scenes, urban landscapes, architectural photos, and portraits. He photographed prominent figures and an ordinary worker. He also advocated combination printing and was one of the founders of a photo society.

==Early life and career==
While working as a civil servant, Bayard experimented with photography. He developed his own method of producing photos called the direct positive process. It involved exposing silver chloride paper to light, which turned the paper completely black. It was then soaked in potassium iodide before being exposed in a camera. After the exposure, it was washed in a bath of sodium hyposulfate and dried.
The resulting image was a unique photograph that could not be reproduced. Because of the paper&#x27;s poor light sensitivity, an exposure of about twelve minutes was required, so that still-lives were favoured and human sitters were told to close their eyes to eliminate the eerie, &quot;dead&quot; quality produced by blinking and moving the eyes during a long exposure.

In the summer of 1851, along with photographers Édouard Baldus, Henri Le Secq, Gustave Le Gray, and O. Mestral, Bayard travelled throughout France to photograph architectural monuments at the request of the &quot;Commission des Monuments Historiques&quot;.

==Self Portrait as a Drowned Man==

Bayard was persuaded to postpone announcing his process to the French Academy of Sciences by François Arago, a friend of Louis Daguerre, who invented the rival daguerreotype process. Arago&#x27;s conflict of interest cost Bayard his recognition as one of the principal inventors of photography. He eventually gave details of the process to the French Academy of Sciences on 24 February 1840, in return for money to buy better equipment.

In reaction to the injustice that he felt he had been subjected to, Bayard made, possibly in October 1840, the first staged photograph, &quot;Self Portrait as a Drowned Man&quot;, in which he pretends to have committed suicide, sitting and leaning to the right. Bayard wrote on the back of his most notable photograph:

==Late career==
Despite his initial hardships in photography, Bayard continued to be a productive member of the photographic society. He was a founding member of the French Society of Photography. Bayard was also one of the first photographers to be commissioned to document and preserve architecture and historical sites in France for the &quot;Missions Héliographiques&quot; in 1851 by the Historic Monument Commission. He used a paper photographic process similar to the one he developed to take pictures for the Commission. Additionally, he suggested combining two negatives to properly expose the sky and then the landscape or building, an idea known as combination printing which began being used in the 1850s.

<doc id="521057" wikidata="Q464203" url="?curid=521057" title="American Family Association">
<text>The American Family Association (AFA) is a conservative and Christian fundamentalist 501(c)(3) organization based in the United States. It opposes LGBTQ rights and expression, pornography, and abortion. It also takes a position on a variety of other public policy goals. It was founded in 1977 by Donald Wildmon as the National Federation for Decency and is headquartered in Tupelo, Mississippi.

Part of the religious right, the AFA defined itself as &quot;a Christian organization promoting the biblical ethic of decency in American society with primary emphasis on television and other media,&quot; later switching their stated emphasis to &quot;moral issues that impact the family.&quot; It engages in activism efforts, including boycotts, buycotts, action alert emails, publications on the AFA&#x27;s web sites or in the &quot;AFA Journal&quot;, broadcasts on American Family Radio, and lobbying. The organization is accredited by the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) and posted a 2011 budget of over $16 million. AFA owns 200 American Family Radio stations in 33 states, seven affiliate stations in seven states, and one affiliate TV station (KAZQ) in New Mexico.

AFA has been listed as an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) since November 2010 for the &quot;propagation of known falsehoods&quot; and the use of &quot;demonizing propaganda&quot; against LGBTQ people.

== Operations ==
Reverend Donald Wildmon served as chairman of AFA until he announced his retirement on March 3, 2010. His son, Tim, is president of AFA. AFA is governed by an independent board of directors.
&quot;AFA Journal&quot; is a monthly publication with a circulation of 180,000 containing news, features, columns, and interviews. In addition to the publication, &quot;AFA Journal&quot; articles are made available online. The journal reviews the content of prime-time television shows, categorizing them based on profanity, sex, violence, homosexuality, substance abuse, &quot;anti-Christian&quot; content, or &quot;political correctness&quot;. The categorization is accompanied by short descriptions of the content of the episode under review. The review also lists the advertisers of each show and invites readers to contact the advertisers or television networks to express concern over program content.

&quot;American Family Radio&quot; (AFR) is a network of approximately 200 AFA-owned radio stations broadcasting Christian-oriented programming.

&quot;OneNewsNow.com&quot; (formerly AgapePress), the AFA news division, provides online audio newscasts and a daily digest of news articles, Associated Press stories, and opinion columns.

Center for Law and Policy, the legal and political arm of the AFA, was shut down in 2007. It specialized in First Amendment cases. The Center for Law and Policy lobbied legislative bodies, drafted legislation, and filed religious-discrimination lawsuits on behalf of individuals. Chief among its efforts were to promote the recognition of Christmas in seasonal print advertisements; the criminalization of homosexuality, and censorship of television programming; and to oppose same-sex marriage, as well as equal-rights and hate-crime legislation that would include sexual orientation and gender identity among the protected categories. and advocating

==Campaigns and issues==
The AFA has a history of activism by organizing its members in boycotts and letter-writing campaigns aimed at promoting socially conservative values in the United States. The AFA has promoted boycotts of television shows, movies, and businesses that the group considers to have promoted indecency, obscenity, or homosexuality. In addition to promoting activism via mail to AFA members, 3.4 million subscribers receive AFA &quot;Action Alerts&quot; via email.

=== Boycotts ===
The AFA has boycotted companies for various reasons, most often relating to Christmas controversies, pornography, support of pro-choice activism, support of violent or sexual content in entertainment, and support of LGBTQ rights, including same-sex partner employee benefits. These organizations include: 7-Eleven, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, American Airlines, American Girl, Blockbuster Video, Burger King, Calvin Klein, Carl&#x27;s Jr., Chobani, Clorox, Comcast, Crest, Ford, Hallmark Cards, Hardee&#x27;s, Kmart, Kraft Foods, S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Movie Gallery, Microsoft, MTV, Paramount Pictures, Time Warner, Universal Studios, DreamWorks, Mary Kay, NutriSystem, Old Navy, IKEA, Sears, Procter &amp; Gamble, Target, Walt Disney Company, and PepsiCo.

In 1986, 7-Eleven stopped selling &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazines after a two-year boycott by the AFA. In 1989, the AFA boycotted WaldenBooks in an attempt to persuade the company to stop selling those same magazines. WaldenBooks responded with an advertisement campaign against censorship, asserting First Amendment rights. WaldenBooks, American Booksellers Association, the Council for Periodical Distributors Association, the International Periodical Distributors Association, and Duval Bibb Services launched a lawsuit against the AFA in October 1989, under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and the Florida State RICO Acts, which protect an organization&#x27;s right to conduct business without harassment or threats. The case was settled by the parties without a court ruling.

AFA boycotted PepsiCo in 1989 for supporting Madonna, whose video for &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; Wildmon felt was sacrilegious.

During the summer of 1993 the AFA purchased full-page ads in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; denouncing the sexual and violent content of the upcoming ABC police drama &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. It also urged ABC affiliates not to broadcast the program and citizens to boycott sponsors of &quot;Blue&quot;. About a quarter of the 225 existing ABC stations followed suit, but such affiliates were mostly in rural areas of the US. The AFA campaign increased hype for the show in larger American media markets, and &quot;Blue&quot; became one of the most popular shows of the 1993–1994 television season.
In 1996, the AFA launched a boycott against Walt Disney Company when the company began giving benefits to same-sex employees in domestic partnerships. The AFA has claimed that Michael Eisner, the CEO of The Disney Company, &quot;was involved in a media group that actively promoted the homosexual agenda&quot; and was pushing the &quot;gay agenda&quot;. The AFA ended the boycott in the spring of 2005 after Eisner left the company. Tim Wildmon stated &quot;We feel after nine years of boycotting Disney we have made our point.&quot;

In January 2002, the restaurant chain Taco Bell held a month-long promotion in which four Cardcaptor Sakura toys were available in their kids&#x27; meals, expecting to distribute up to 7 million of the toys during the month. The AFA complained about the promotion, saying the Clow Cards being offered were similar to tarot cards and the series they were derived from was akin to Eastern mythology. However, the organization&#x27;s complaints began on the day before the promotion&#x27;s scheduled end date.

In 2003, the AFA, with the American Decency Association, Focus on the Family, and Citizens for Community Values, lobbied and boycotted Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, calling on &quot;A&amp;F to stop using blatant pornography in its quarterly catalog&quot;. In December 2003, the company &quot;recalled the holiday catalog from all its stores, saying it needed the space on the counter for a new perfume&quot; and stated it would stop printing catalogs and start a new campaign.

In 2005, the AFA boycotted the company American Girl, seller of dolls and accessories, over their support of the charity Girls, Inc., which the AFA called &quot;a pro-abortion, pro-lesbian advocacy group&quot;.

In Spring 2005, the AFA launched a boycott of Ford for advertising in gay magazines, donating to gay rights organizations, and sponsoring gay pride celebrations. After meeting with representatives of the group, Ford announced it was curtailing ads in a number of major gay-themed publications, due not to cultural but to &quot;cost-cutting&quot; factors. That statement was contradicted by the AFA, which claimed it had a &quot;good faith agreement&quot; that Ford would cease such ads. Soon afterwards, as a result of a strong outcry from the gay community, Ford backtracked and announced it would continue ads in gay publications, in response to which the AFA denounced Ford for &quot;violating&quot; the agreement, and renewed threats of a boycott. The boycott ended in March 2008.

On Independence Day 2008, the AFA announced a boycott of McDonald&#x27;s, which had a director on the board of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. In October 2008, AFA announced the end of its boycott following the declaration to be &quot;neutral on same-sex marriage or any &#x27;homosexual agenda&#x27; as defined by the American Family Association&quot; by McDonald&#x27;s in a memo to franchisees.

In December 2008, the AFA issued an &quot;Action Alert&quot; which called for members to protest the Campbell Soup Company, which had purchased two two-page advertisements in the December 2008 and January 2009 issues of the LGBTQ magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;. Donald Wildmon said that the ads, which showed a lesbian couple with their son, &quot;sent a message that homosexual parents constitute a family and are worthy of support&quot;.

In November 2009, the AFA called for a boycott against clothing retailer The Gap, Inc., claiming the retailer&#x27;s holiday television advertising campaign failed to mention Christmas. &quot;Christmas has historically been very good for commerce. But now Gap wants the commerce but no Christmas&quot; wrote an AFA spokesperson. The Gap soon released an advertisement in response to the boycott, specifically referring to Christmas, albeit with a number of other holidays that take place at the same time of year and added the word &quot;Christmas&quot; to in-store decor.

In 2012 the AFA led a boycott against Archie Comics when they published a comic book featuring a same-sex marriage.

In July 2012, they considered boycotting Google due to Google&#x27;s &quot;Legalize Love&quot; campaign which supports LGBTQ rights.

In April 2016, AFA launched a boycott against Target Corporation due to Target announcing they &quot;welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity&quot;. In August 2016 Target announced that it would invest $20 million into adding single-occupancy restrooms in its stores in response to the boycott. In February 2025 the boycott on Target ended after the company announced it was rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts including participation in the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s LGBT index in January 2025.

=== Published media ===
On April 16, 2007, following the Virginia Tech Massacre, the AFA released a video titled &quot;The Day They Kicked God out of the Schools&quot;, in which God tells a student that students were killed in schools because God is not allowed in schools anymore. The video claims that the shootings at Virginia Tech and Columbine, among others, are in part the result of: decreased discipline in schools; no prayer in schools; sex out of wedlock; rampant violence in TV, movies, and music; or abortions.

&quot;&quot; is a 2008 documentary series hosted by Janet Parshall. The series explains the AFA&#x27;s position against the drive towards political correctness, and how various factors, such as hate crime laws and other discriminatory actions, are threatening the Christians&#x27; existence. In 2009, a one-hour special version of the program was produced and aired on commercial television stations, where AFA had purchased the air time.

=== Sexual morality ===
The AFA has repeatedly lobbied Congress to eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.

Speaking in defense of Mike Huckabee&#x27;s statements that people with AIDS should be quarantined, the head of the AFA of Pennsylvania said Huckabee&#x27;s recommendation was appropriate.

===View on media===
Wildmon has been accused of saying that he believes Hollywood and the theater world are heavily influenced by Jewish people, and that television network executives and advertisers have a genuine hostility towards Christians.

===Opposition to other religions===
On November 28, 2006, following the election of Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, the AFA released an &quot;Action Alert.&quot; The Action Alert, entitled &quot;A first for America...The Koran replaces the Bible at swearing-in oath: What book will America base its values on, the Bible or the Koran?&quot;, requested subscribers to write to their Congressional representatives and urge them to create a &quot;law making the Bible the book used in the swearing-in ceremony of representatives and senators.&quot;

On July 13, 2007, a Hindu prayer was conducted in the U.S. Senate. Rajan Zed, director of interfaith relations at a Hindu temple, read the prayer at the invitation of Senate majority leader Harry Reid, who defended his invitation based on the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. AFA sent out an &quot;Action Alert&quot; to its members to email, write letters, or call their senators to oppose the Hindu prayer, stating it is &quot;seeking the invocation of a non-monotheistic god.&quot; The &quot;alert&quot; stated that &quot;since Hindus worship multiple gods, the prayer will be completely outside the American paradigm, flying in the face of the American motto &quot;One Nation Under God.&quot; The convocation by Zed was disrupted by three protesters from a different Fundamentalist Christian activist group, Operation Save America, in the gallery; they reportedly shouted &quot;this is an abomination&quot;, and called themselves &quot;Christians and patriots&quot;.

On August 10, 2010, Bryan Fischer, AFA&#x27;s director of Issue Analysis for Government and Public Policy, posted on his blog on the AFA website that &quot;Permits should not be granted to build even one more mosque in the United States of America, let alone the monstrosity planned for Ground Zero. This is for one simple reason: each Islamic mosque is dedicated to the overthrow of the American government.&quot; Fischer continued: &quot;Because of this subversive ideology, Muslims cannot claim religious freedom protections under the First Amendment.&quot;

=== Homosexuality ===

The AFA expresses public concern over what it refers to as the &quot;homosexual agenda&quot;. They state that the Bible &quot;declares that homosexuality is unnatural and sinful&quot; and that they have &quot;sponsored several events reaching out to homosexuals and letting them know there is love and healing at the Cross of Christ.&quot;

The AFA actively lobbies against the social acceptance of homosexual behavior (&quot;We oppose the homosexual movement&#x27;s efforts to convince our society that their behavior is normal&quot;). The AFA also actively promotes the idea that homosexuality is a choice and that sexual orientation can be changed through ex-gay ministries.

In 1996, responding to a complaint from an AFA member who was participating in an AFA campaign targeting gay journalists, the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; transferred a gay editor out of a job that occasionally required him to work with schoolchildren. The AFA targeted the editor due to cartoon strips he created, which were published in gay magazines. The paper apparently acted on the AFA&#x27;s unsubstantiated statement that the editor was &quot;preoccupied with the subjects of pedophilia and incest.&quot;

In 2000, vice president Tim Wildmon spoke out against gay-straight alliance clubs in schools, stating, &quot;We view these kinds of clubs as an advancement of the homosexual cause.&quot; In 2003, the AFA filed an amicus curiae brief in Lawrence vs Texas, arguing against repeal of Texas sodomy laws. In 2004, the AFA raised concerns about the movie &quot;Shark Tale&quot; because the group believed the movie was designed to promote the acceptance of gay rights by children. On the October 11, 2005, AFA broadcast, Tim Wildmon agreed with a caller that cable networks like Animal Planet and HGTV featured &quot;evidence of homosexuality and lesbian people&quot; and added that &quot;you have to watch out for children&#x27;s programs today as well because they&#x27;ll slip it in there as well.&quot; In 2007, the AFA spoke out against IKEA for featuring gay families in their television ads. In June 2008, the AFA protested a Heinz television advertisement, shown in the United Kingdom, which showed two men kissing, which Heinz then withdrew. On January 28, 2015, the AFA wrote to the Southern Poverty Law Center that the AFA now rejected the policy that homosexual conduct should be illegal.

The AFA&#x27;s founder, Don Wildmon, was &quot;instrumental&quot; in initially setting up the Arlington Group, a networking vehicle for social conservatives focusing on gay marriage.

===One Million Moms/One Million Dads project===
AFA created &quot;One Million Moms&quot; and &quot;One Million Dads&quot;, two websites with the stated goal of mobilizing parents to &quot;stop the exploitation of children&quot; by the media. It uses these websites to organize boycotts and urge activists to send emails to mainstream companies employing advertising, selling products, or advertising on television shows they find offensive. In 2012, the group started and then backed off from a failed campaign against the hiring of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as a spokesperson for department store chain J. C. Penney. They opposed her employment on the grounds that DeGeneres is &quot;an open homosexual&quot;. At a taping of her show, DeGeneres informed her audience of the fizzled effort: &quot;They wanted to get me fired and I am proud and happy to say J. C. Penney stuck by their decision to make me their spokesperson.&quot;

The One Million Moms campaign opposed Marvel and DC Comics issues which featured gay characters, describing the storylines as a &quot;brainwashing and desensitizing experience&quot; for children, written to &quot;influence them in thinking that a gay lifestyle choice is normal and desirable.&quot;

The organization criticized GEICO for a 2013 commercial showing Maxwell the Pig in a car with a human girl, saying it suggests bestiality.

In 2015, the organization criticized a Campbell&#x27;s ad that depicted two dads taking care of their child by feeding him Campbell&#x27;s Star Wars soup. The organization claimed the ad &quot;normaliz[ed] sin.&quot;

In 2019, the organization complained about ads airing on The Hallmark Channel for wedding planning site Zola, which featured two brides kissing at the altar. In response, Hallmark&#x27;s parent company Crown Media pulled the ads. After protests from the public, including celebrities Ellen DeGeneres and William Shatner, Crown Media reversed their decision and stated they would reinstate the ads. In 2020, Burger King was their target for using the word &quot;damn&quot; in a television commercial.

The actual number involved in One Million Moms has been questioned. After a complaint about Burger King ads using the word &quot;damn&quot;, a CNN article stated that &quot;Despite its name, it is not clear that the group has a million members. According to its website, more than 8,000 people have taken action on the Burger King issue, and its Facebook group has just shy of 100,000 likes.&quot;

===In God We Trust===

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, many public schools across the United States posted &quot;In God We Trust&quot; framed posters in their &quot;libraries, cafeterias and classrooms&quot;. The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters.

== Criticism and controversy ==
In 2015, the organisation officially repudiated views of former director of issues analysis Bryan Fischer, including the claim that black people &quot;rut like rabbits&quot;; that the First Amendment applies only to Christians; that Hispanics are &quot;socialists by nature&quot; and come to the U.S. to &quot;plunder&quot; the country; that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian, and that &quot;Homosexuality gave us Adolf Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.&quot;

===Religious exercise===
Sandy Rios, the Family Association&#x27;s director of governmental affairs, has criticised &quot;powerful Jewish forces behind the ACLU&quot; and stated that secular Jews often &quot;turn out to be the worst enemies of the country&quot; while the AFA&#x27;s president Tim Wildmon stated &quot;Most of the Jews in this country, unfortunately, are far-left.&quot;

Bryan Fischer, former director of issues analysis, has described Muslims as &quot;Parasites Who Must Convert or Die&quot; and stated that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects only the religious practice of Christianity, writing in a blog post &quot;The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects... So the purpose of the First Amendment was most decidedly NOT to &quot;approve, support, (or) accept&quot; any &quot;religion&quot; other than Christianity.&quot; Fischer has suggested Jews and Muslims are not included in religious freedom protections in the US, saying: &quot;I have contended for years that the First Amendment, as given by the Founders, provides religious liberty protections for Christianity only.&quot;
He later wrote: &quot;We are a Christian nation and not a Jewish or Muslim one.&quot;

In a 2015 press release denouncing Fischer&#x27;s views, the AFA stated &quot;AFA rejects the idea expressed by Bryan Fischer that &#x27;Free exercise of religion&#x27; only applies to Christians. Consequently, AFA rejects Bryan&#x27;s assertions that Muslims should not be granted permits to build mosques in the United States.&quot;

=== Stance on homosexuality ===
The AFA has been criticized by a number of organizations for their stance against gay rights.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, through its Teaching Tolerance program, has encouraged schools across the U.S. to hold a &quot;Mix It Up at Lunch&quot; day in order to encourage students to break up cliques and prevent bullying. In late 2012, the AFA called the project – begun 11 years earlier and held in more than 2,500 schools – &quot;a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools&quot;, urging parents to keep their children home from school on October 30, 2012, and to call the schools to protest the event. &quot;I was surprised that they completely lied about what Mix It Up Day is&quot;, Maureen Costello, the director of the center&#x27;s Teaching Tolerance project, which organizes the program, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;It was a cynical, fear-mongering tactic.&quot; In October, Bryan Fischer was taken off air during a CNN interview with Carol Costello for repeating his belief that &quot;Hitler recruited homosexuals around him to make up his Stormtroopers.&quot;

In 2012, as jury selection was to begin in a trial on charges of kidnapping of a lesbian couple&#x27;s daughter, Fischer wrote on Twitter in support of kidnapping of children from same-sex households and smuggling them to what he calls &quot;normal&quot; homes. Fischer also reiterated his views on his radio show, and on video. In January 2013, he compared consensual sex between people of the same gender to pedophilia, incest and bestiality. In January 2013, Fischer compared the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s change in views on gay scouts and scoutmasters to Jerry Sandusky, saying allowing gay scoutmasters was inviting pedophiles into the tents of children. In March 2013, Fischer compared homosexuality to bank robbery when Senator Portman announced his views on same-sex marriage had changed due to having a gay son. Fischer also stated that homosexuality should be banned like trans fats for being &quot;a hazard to human health&quot; and likened homosexuals to thieves, murderers and child molesters.

On January 28, 2015, Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, demoted Fischer from being a spokesperson. Fischer went on to state that he will still be hosting the AFA&#x27;s American Family Talk radio. In order to avoid being categorised as a hate group by Israel, the AFA issued a press release denouncing some of Fischer&#x27;s views, rejecting his claim that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian, and stating: &quot;AFA rejects the statement by Bryan Fischer that, &#x27;Homosexuality gave us Adolf Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.&#x27; AFA rejects the policy advocated by Bryan Fischer that homosexual conduct should be illegal. AFA rejects the notion advocated by Bryan Fischer that, &#x27;We need an underground railroad to protect innocent children from same-sex households.&#x27;&quot;

====Homosexuality and Nazism====
Former AFA California leader Scott Lively is a co-author of &quot;The Pink Swastika&quot; (1995), in which he claims that all of the major leaders in the Nazi regime were homosexual, a claim which is widely rejected by most historians. He has since co-founded Watchmen on the Walls. In 2007, Bryan Fischer, former Director of Issues Analysis for the AFA, hosted Scott Lively at an event promoting the message that &quot;homosexuality was at the heart of Nazism&quot;.

In May 2010, Fischer wrote a blog post on the AFA website and RenewAmerica detailing purported allegations that Adolf Hitler was a homosexual, that &quot;the Nazi Party began in a gay bar in Munich&quot;, and concluded by claiming that the Holocaust (which included gay victims of Nazi persecution) was caused by homosexuals in the Nazi German military: &quot;Nazi Germany became the horror that it was because it rejected both Christianity and its clear teaching about human sexuality.&quot; On American Family Talk radio, Fischer repeated the claim that Hitler was a homosexual, and stated that Hitler recruited homosexuals to be stormtroopers, because &quot;homosexual soldiers basically had no limits and the savagery and brutality they were willing to inflict.&quot;

In 2013, Fischer claimed that &quot;Homofascists&quot; will treat Christians like Jews in the Holocaust and later that year he repeated on American Family Talk that Hitler started the Nazi party &quot;in a gay bar in Munich&quot; and that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t get straights to be vicious enough in being his enforcers.&quot;

====Criticism of homosexuality====
In 1998, the Internet filtering software CyberPatrol blocked the AFA&#x27;s web site, classifying it under the category &quot;intolerance&quot;, defined as &quot;pictures or text advocating prejudice or discrimination against any race, color, national origin, religion, disability or handicap, gender or sexual orientation...&quot; AFA spokesman Steve Ensley told reporters, &quot;Basically we&#x27;re being blocked for free speech.&quot; CyberPatrol cited quotes from the AFA for meeting its intolerance criteria, which included: &quot;Indifference or neutrality toward the homosexual rights movement will result in society&#x27;s destruction by allowing civil order to be redefined and by plummeting ourselves, our children, and grandchildren into an age of godlessness&quot;; &quot;A national &#x27;Coming Out of Homosexuality&#x27; provides us a means whereby to dispel the lies of the homosexual rights crowd who say they are born that way and cannot change&quot;; and &quot;We want to outlaw public homosexuality...We believe homosexuality is immoral and leads ultimately to personal and social decay.&quot;

On October 19, 1998, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led by Leslie Katz, wrote a letter to the AFA in response to an advertisement placed in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; by the AFA regarding homosexuality and Christianity. The letter stated:

Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against gays, lesbians and transgendered people. What happened to Matthew Shepard is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.

During the same time, the City and County of San Francisco passed two resolutions. Resolution No. 234-99 &quot;calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against Mr. Gaither&quot; and Resolution No. 873-98 was specifically directed at &quot;anti-gay&quot; television advertisements. AFA unsuccessfully challenged these actions as violating the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment in &quot;American Family Association v. City and County of San Francisco&quot;.

In 1998, multiple organizations voiced criticism of a series of AFA-sponsored full-page newspaper advertisements that promoted religious ministries involved in the ex-gay movement. In response to the advertisements, the Religious Leadership Roundtable said the ads employed &quot;language of violence and hatred to denounce other people&quot;. IntegrityUSA criticized the ads, calling them &quot;evil&quot; disregarding Christian teachings about the &quot;dignity of every human being&quot;. DignityUSA also criticized the advertisements, which they said were &quot;misleading and destructive&quot;.

In July 2000, the AFA sent out emails and letters calling for openly gay Arizona Republican United States House of Representatives member Jim Kolbe to be barred from speaking at the Republican National Convention. The AFA also said that Kolbe should be arrested when he returned to his home state, as because Kolbe is gay, he was violating an Arizona law that banned sodomy. Equality Mississippi, a statewide LGBTQ civil rights organization which has voiced opposition and criticism towards the AFA&#x27;s activism regarding homosexuality, felt that AFA&#x27;s action was constituting and encouraging violence towards the gay community.

In 2005, Equality Mississippi publicly spoke out against the AFA for the use of copyrighted images on the AFA web site in its boycott against Kraft Foods for being a sponsor of the 2006 Gay Games in Chicago. The photographs, which were used without permission, were owned by and retrieved from ChrisGeary.com. Equality Mississippi encouraged ChrisGeary.com to file suit against the AFA and offered to support the suit. , the images were still on AFA&#x27;s web site.

In June 2008, AFA&#x27;s news website, &quot;OneNewsNow&quot; – which had begun replacing all instances of &quot;gay&quot; with &quot;homosexual&quot; in re-posted Associated Press articles – changed an AP profile of Olympic sprinter Tyson Gay, rendering his name as &quot;Tyson Homosexual&quot;. &quot;OneNewsNow&quot; similarly altered the name of basketball player Rudy Gay, naming him &quot;Rudy Homosexual&quot;. The gay rights website GoodAsYou.org, which &quot;has long chronicled the AFA&#x27;s practice of changing AP copy to suit its conservative agenda&quot;, spotted the errors. Tyson Gay was upset with the mistake.

In 2019, Fischer wrote on AFA&#x27;s website that homosexuality is inescapably linked to pedophilia.

=== Intellectual freedom ===

Individuals in the media industry have criticized Donald Wildmon, the founder of AFA. Gene Mater, senior vice president of CBS Television, has stated, &quot;We look upon Wildmon&#x27;s efforts as the greatest frontal assault on intellectual freedom this country has ever faced&quot; and Brandon Tartikoff, then NBC Entertainment President, stated that Wildmon&#x27;s boycott campaign was &quot;the first step toward a police state.&quot;

=== Marilyn Manson ===
Paul Cambria, lawyer for rock band Marilyn Manson, sent a cease and desist letter to AFA on April 25, 1997, in response to allegations published in the &quot;AFA Journal&quot; that Manson encouraged audience members to engage in sexual and violent acts in its concerts. &quot;AFA Journal&quot; relied on testimony by two anonymous claimed teenage concertgoers. The allegations were independently proven to be false. Wildmon responded that his organization as a whole was not responsible, but rather the AFA&#x27;s Gulf Coast chapter in Biloxi, Mississippi.

===Hate group listing===
The Southern Poverty Law Center, in a 2005 report, stated that the AFA, along with other groups, engaged in hate speech to &quot;help drive the religious right&#x27;s anti-gay crusade&quot;. Mark Potok of the SPLC determined that the turning point was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, in which the Supreme Court struck down Texas&#x27;s anti-sodomy laws. After that, the Christian right spent millions on advertisements, and on pastor briefings organized by activists such as &quot;born-again&quot; Christian David Lane. Lane helped AFA put constitutional opposite-sex marriage amendments on the ballots of 13 states.

In November 2010, the SPLC changed their listing of AFA from a group that used hate speech to the more serious one of being designated a hate group. Potok said that the AFA&#x27;s &quot;propagation of known falsehoods and demonizing propaganda&quot; was the basis for the change.

The AFA was greatly displeased with the designation as a hate group, calling the list &quot;slanderous&quot;. In response to the SPLC&#x27;s announcement, some members of the Christian right &quot;called on Congress to cut off their funding&quot;. J. Matt Barber of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; said that the SPLC was &quot;marginalizing&quot; themselves by giving the AFA the same hate group designation shared by the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. Tony Perkins, the president of Family Research Council (FRC) – an organization also named a hate group – asked the SPLC to strike the new designation, but they held their position. Ken Williams commented that in reaction, the FRC and the AFA joined with other &quot;pro-family&quot; organizations targeted by the SPLC to establish a new website, an online petition called &quot;Start Debating/Stop Hating&quot; to counter the SPLC, and they took out full-page ads in two Washington D.C. newspapers, defending their work &quot;to protect and promote natural marriage and the family&quot;. The advertisement stated the &quot;undersigned stand in solidarity&quot; with the organizations designated as hate groups, and that they &quot;support the vigorous but responsible exercise of the First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty that are the birthright of all Americans&quot;. House Speaker–Designate John Boehner and the governors of Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia were among those signing the statement. The SPLC addressed the new website statement; Potok was quoted by David Weigel of &quot;Slate&quot; magazine as saying, &quot;the SPLC&#x27;s listings of these groups is based on their propagation of known falsehoods – claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling.&quot; The American Independent News Network (AINN) noted that the AFA had recently denounced Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan as a lesbian unfit for office – AINN stated that &quot;she&#x27;s not&quot; a lesbian – and that Fischer said Hitler&#x27;s savage and brutal methods were only possible because he and most of his stormtroopers were gay. Jillian Rayfield of &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; noted the irony in the website calling the SPLC a &quot;radical Left&quot; group &quot;spreading hateful rhetoric&quot; yet elsewhere declaring that the debates of the Christian right &quot;can and must remain civil – but they must never be suppressed through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent&#x27;s character&quot;.

<text>The Philippine Sea plate or the Philippine plate is a tectonic plate comprising oceanic lithosphere that lies beneath the Philippine Sea, to the east of the Philippines. Most segments of the Philippines, including northern Luzon, are part of the Philippine Mobile Belt, which is geologically and tectonically separate from the Philippine Sea plate.

The plate is bordered mostly by convergent boundaries: To the north, the Philippine Sea plate meets the Okhotsk microplate at the Nankai Trough. The Philippine Sea plate, the Amurian plate, and the Okhotsk plate meet near Mount Fuji in Japan. The thickened crust of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana arc colliding with Japan constitutes the Izu Collision Zone. The east of the plate includes the Izu–Ogasawara (Bonin) and the Mariana Islands, forming the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc system. There is also a divergent boundary between the Philippine Sea plate and the small Mariana plate which carries the Mariana Islands. To the east, the Pacific plate subducts beneath the Philippine Sea plate at the Izu–Ogasawara Trench. To the south, the Philippine Sea plate is bounded by the Caroline plate and Bird&#x27;s Head plate. To the west, the Philippine Sea plate subducts under the Philippine Mobile Belt at the Philippine Trench and the East Luzon Trench. (The adjacent rendition of Prof. Peter Bird&#x27;s map is inaccurate in this respect.) To the northwest, the Philippine Sea plate meets Taiwan and the Nansei islands on the Okinawa plate, and southern Japan on the Amurian plate.
It also meets the Yangtze plate due northwest.

<text>The University of Alaska System is a system of public universities in the U.S. state of Alaska. It was created in 1917 and comprises three separately accredited universities on 19 campuses. The system serves nearly 30,000 full- and part-time students and offers 400 unique degree programs.

Each of the three main universities has several satellite campuses in smaller communities. UAA also operates three large satellite community colleges. The three major institutions in the University of Alaska system are:

* University of Alaska Anchorage, the largest university by enrollment in the system;
* University of Alaska Fairbanks, the first university and flagship;
* University of Alaska Southeast, located in the capital city of Juneau, with campuses in Sitka and Ketchikan and the smallest by enrollment.

Since the population of Alaska is smaller than that of most U.S. states, the University of Alaska System is also relatively small. However, it does have several notable academic departments. At UAF, these are the geology department, the atmospheric sciences department, and the wildlife biology department. Reflecting the state&#x27;s small population, the amount of federal land granted to the University of Alaska under the Morrill Act was the second-smallest grant in the country.

==Governance==
The University of Alaska is formally established under Article VII of the Alaska State Constitution. Article VII also establishes a board of regents, appointed by the state&#x27;s governor and confirmed by the state&#x27;s legislature, that is tasked with governing the university. All regents serve eight-year terms, except for the student regent, who is nominated by the three main campuses for a two-year term. The board selects a university president who oversees the statewide administration. Under the president, responsibility for the three main universities is assigned to their respective chancellors. There is also the Coalition of Student Leaders, a group of representatives from the UA student governments that advocates for student issues.

==University of Alaska Anchorage==
The University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) is the largest university in the state, with approximately 15,000 full- and part-time students across all of its campuses. Roughly two thirds of University of Alaska students attend UAA. There are twelve Colleges within UAA, four of which are community campuses in Valdez, Kenai Peninsula (Soldotna and Homer), Kodiak, and the Mat-Su. UAA has thirteen different sports through the NCAA, and competes nationally as the Seawolves. The Carnegie Foundation has classified the institution as a community-engaged campus with high enrollments in undergraduate programs, and a balance among arts, sciences, and professional preparation. Alaska&#x27;s only medical school or WWAMI program is also administered through the Anchorage campus. The campus is also home to the only FAA-approved collegiate flight training program in the state.

==University of Alaska Fairbanks==
The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) was known officially as the University of Alaska from 1925 to 1975. UAF is home to the noted Geophysical Institute, which operates the Poker Flat Research Range, a collegiate rocket test range. Until 2015, there was also the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center, the location of the only Cray supercomputer in the Arctic region. There is also the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, which has facilities and research projects all over Alaska and the Arctic Ocean. It is the first university founded in Alaska and is the flagship institution of the University of Alaska system.

The University of Alaska Fairbanks also has five satellite campuses in Fairbanks: the Bristol Bay Campus in Dillingham, the Chukchi Campus in Kotzebue, the Interior Alaska Campus (based in Fairbanks but serving rural communities across Interior Alaska), the Kuskokwim Campus in Bethel, and the Northwest Campus in Nome. The Kuskokwim Campus also operates a remote learning center in Hooper Bay.

==University of Alaska Southeast==
The University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) is located in the state&#x27;s capital, Juneau, and is the smallest system. Although it has campuses in Juneau, Sitka, and Ketchikan, the Juneau Campus is the largest of the three. UAS focuses on a strong liberal arts education and experiential learning. There are four academic schools at UAS: the School of Arts &amp; Sciences, the School of Management, the School of Career Education, and the School of Education. As of 2017, the Board of Regents of Alaska has appointed UAS as the University of Alaska&#x27;s center for the College of Education.

<text>The following is a list of numbered minor planets (essentially the same as asteroids) in ascending numerical order. Minor planets are defined as small bodies in the Solar System, including asteroids, distant objects, and dwarf planets, but not including comets. The catalog consists of hundreds of pages, each containing 1,000 minor planets. Every year, the Minor Planet Center, which operates on behalf of the International Astronomical Union, publishes thousands of newly numbered minor planets in its &quot;Minor Planet Circulars&quot; &quot;(see index)&quot;. , there are 773,916 numbered minor planets (secured discoveries) out of a total of 1,424,223 observed small Solar System bodies, with the remainder being unnumbered minor planets and comets.

The catalog&#x27;s first object is , discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi in 1801, while its best-known entry is Pluto, listed as . The vast majority (97.3%) of minor planets are asteroids from the asteroid belt (the catalog uses a color code to indicate a body&#x27;s dynamical classification). There are more than a thousand different minor-planet discoverers observing from a growing list of registered observatories. In terms of numbers, the most prolific discoverers are Spacewatch, LINEAR, MLS, NEAT and CSS. There are also 25,120 named minor planets mostly after people, places and figures from mythology and fiction, which account for only of all numbered catalog entries. and are currently the lowest-numbered unnamed and highest-numbered named minor planets, respectively.

It is expected that the upcoming survey by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will discover another 5 million minor planets during the next ten years—almost a tenfold increase from current numbers. While all main-belt asteroids with a diameter above have already been discovered, there might be as many as 10 trillion -sized asteroids or larger out to the orbit of Jupiter; and more than a trillion minor planets in the Kuiper belt. For minor planets grouped by a particular aspect or property, &quot;see &quot;.

== Description of partial lists ==

The list of minor planets consists of more than 700 partial lists, each containing 1000 minor planets grouped into 10 tables. The data is sourced from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and expanded with data from the JPL SBDB (mean-diameter), Johnston&#x27;s archive (sub-classification) and others &quot;(see detailed field descriptions below)&quot;. For an overview of all existing partial lists, &quot;see &quot;.

The information given for a minor planet includes a permanent and provisional designation &quot;()&quot;, a citation that links to the meanings of minor planet names (only if named), the discovery date, location, and credited discoverers &quot;( and )&quot;, a category with a more refined classification than the principal grouping represented by the background color &quot;()&quot;, a mean-diameter, sourced from JPL&#x27;s SBDB or otherwise calculated estimates in italics &quot;()&quot;, and a reference (Ref) to the corresponding pages at MPC and JPL SBDB.

The MPC may credit one or several astronomers, a survey or similar program, or even the observatory site with the discovery. In the first column of the table, an existing stand-alone article is linked in boldface, while (self-)redirects are never linked. Discoverers, discovery site and category are only linked if they differ from the preceding catalog entry.

=== Example ===

The example above shows five catalog entries from one of the partial lists. All five asteroids were discovered at Palomar Observatory by the Palomar–Leiden survey (PLS). The MPC directly credits the survey&#x27;s principal investigators, that is, the astronomers Cornelis van Houten, Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld and Tom Gehrels. (This is the only instance where the list of minor planets diverges from the &quot;Discovery Circumstances&quot; in the official MPC list.) 189004 Capys, discovered on 16 October 1977, is the only named minor planet among these five. Its background color indicates that it is a Jupiter trojan (from the Trojan camp at Jupiter&#x27;s ), estimated to be approximately 12 kilometers in diameter. All other objects are smaller asteroids from the inner (white), central (light-grey) and outer regions (dark grey) of the asteroid belt. The provisional designation for all objects is an uncommon survey designation.

=== Designation ===
After discovery, minor planets generally receive a provisional designation, e.g. , then a leading sequential number in parentheses, e.g. , turning it into a permanent designation (numbered minor planet). Optionally, a name can be given, replacing the provisional part of the designation, e.g. . (On Wikipedia, named minor planets also drop their parentheses.)

In modern times, a minor planet receives a sequential number only after it has been observed several times over at least 4 oppositions. Minor planets whose orbits are not (yet) precisely known are known by their provisional designation. This rule was not necessarily followed in earlier times, and some bodies received a number but subsequently became lost minor planets. The 2000 recovery of , which had been lost for nearly 89 years, eliminated the last numbered lost asteroid. Only after a number is assigned is the minor planet eligible to receive a name. Usually the discoverer has up to 10 years to pick a name; many minor planets now remain unnamed. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century, large-scale automated asteroid discovery programs such as LINEAR have increased the pace of discoveries so much that the vast majority of minor planets will most likely never receive names.

For these reasons, the sequence of numbers only approximately matches the timeline of discovery. In extreme cases, such as lost minor planets, there may be a considerable mismatch: for instance the high-numbered was originally discovered in 1937, but it was lost until 2003. Only after it was rediscovered could its orbit be established and a number assigned.


=== Discoverers ===
The MPC credits more than 1,000 professional and amateur astronomers as discoverers of minor planets. Many of them have discovered only a few minor planets or even just co-discovered a single one. Moreover, a discoverer does not need to be a human being. There are about 300 programs, surveys and observatories credited as discoverers. Among these, a small group of U.S. programs and surveys actually account for most of all discoveries made so far &quot;(see pie chart)&quot;. As the total of numbered minor planets is growing by the tens of thousands every year, all statistical figures are constantly changing. In contrast to the Top 10 discoverers displayed in this articles, the MPC summarizes the total of discoveries somewhat differently, that is by a distinct group of discoverers. For example, bodies discovered in the Palomar–Leiden Survey are directly credited to the program&#x27;s principal investigators.

=== Discovery site ===
Observatories, telescopes and surveys that report astrometric observations of small Solar System bodies to the Minor Planet Center receive a numeric or alphanumeric MPC code such as 675 for the Palomar Observatory, or G96 for the Mount Lemmon Survey. On numbering, the MPC may directly credit such an observatory or program as the discoverer of an object, rather than one or several astronomers.

=== Category ===
In this catalog, minor planets are classified into one of 8 principal orbital groups and highlighted with a distinct color. These are:

The vast majority of minor planets are evenly distributed between the inner-, central and outer parts of the asteroid belt, which are separated by the two Kirkwood gaps at 2.5 and 2.82 AU. Nearly 97.5% of all minor planets are main-belt asteroids (MBA), while Jupiter trojans, Mars-crossing and near-Earth asteroids each account for less than 1% of the overall population. Only a small number of distant minor planets, that is the centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects, have been numbered so far. In the partial lists, table column &quot;category&quot; further refines this principal grouping:
* main-belt asteroids show their family membership based on the synthetic hierarchical clustering method by Nesvorný (2014),
* resonant asteroids are displayed by their numerical ratio and include the Hildas (3:2), Cybeles (7:4), Thules (4:3) and Griquas (2:1), while the Jupiter trojans (1:1) display whether they belong to the Greek () or Trojan camp (),
* Hungaria asteroids (H), are labelled in italics (&quot;H&quot;), when they are not members of the collisional family
* near-Earth objects are divided into the Aten (ATE), Amor (AMO), Apollo (APO), and Atira (ATI) group, with some of them being potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA), and/or larger than one kilometer in diameter (+1km) as determined by the MPC.
* trans-Neptunian objects are divided into dynamical subgroups including cubewanos (hot or cold), scattered disc objects, plutinos and other Neptunian resonances,
* comet-like and/or retrograde objects with a TJupiter value below 2 are tagged with damocloid,
* other unusual objects based on MPC&#x27;s and Johnston&#x27;s lists are labelled unusual,
* binary and triple minor planets with companions are tagged with &quot;moon&quot; and link to their corresponding entry in minor-planet moon,
* objects with an exceptionally long or short rotation period are tagged with &quot;slow&quot; (period of 100+ hours) or &quot;fast&quot; (period of less than 2.2 hours) and link to their corresponding entry in List of slow rotators and List of fast rotators, respectively.
* minor planets which also received a periodic-comet number (such as ) link to the List of numbered comets

: (b) Including 37 unclassified bodies: ().
: (c) This chart has been created using a classification scheme adopted from and with data provided by the JPL Small-Body Database.

=== Diameter ===

If available, a minor planet&#x27;s mean diameter in meters (m) or kilometers (km) is taken from the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, which the Small-Body Database has also adopted. Mean diameters are rounded to two significant figures if smaller than 100 kilometers. Estimates are in italics and calculated from a magnitude-to-diameter conversion, using an assumed albedo derived from the body&#x27;s orbital parameters or, if available, from a family-specific mean albedo &quot;(also see asteroid family table)&quot;.

<doc id="521079" wikidata="Q1076291" url="?curid=521079" title="Retaining wall">
<text>Retaining walls are relatively rigid walls used for supporting soil laterally so that it can be retained at different levels on the two sides. Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope). They are used to bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of inconveniently steep terrain in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses. A retaining wall that retains soil on the backside and water on the frontside is called a seawall or a bulkhead.

==Definition==
A retaining wall is designed to hold in place a mass of earth or the like, such as the edge of a terrace or excavation. The structure is constructed to resist the lateral pressure of soil when there is a desired change in ground elevation that exceeds the angle of repose of the soil.

A basement wall is thus one kind of retaining wall; however, the term usually refers to a cantilever retaining wall, which is a freestanding structure without lateral support at its top. These are cantilevered from a footing and rise above the grade on one side to retain a higher level grade on the opposite side. The walls must resist the lateral pressures generated by loose soils or, in some cases, water pressures.

Every retaining wall supports a &quot;wedge&quot; of soil. The wedge is defined as the soil which extends beyond the failure plane of the soil type present at the wall site, and can be calculated once the soil friction angle is known. As the setback of the wall increases, the size of the sliding wedge is reduced. This reduction lowers the pressure on the retaining wall.

The most important consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls is to recognize and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move downslope due to gravity. This creates lateral earth pressure behind the wall which depends on the angle of internal friction (phi) and the cohesive strength (c) of the retained material, as well as the direction and magnitude of movement the retaining structure undergoes.

Lateral earth pressures are zero at the top of the wall and – in homogeneous ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes hydrostatic pressure on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for lengthwise stretches of uniform height.

It is important to have proper drainage behind the wall in order to limit the pressure to the wall&#x27;s design value. Drainage materials will reduce or eliminate the hydrostatic pressure and improve the stability of the material behind the wall. Drystone retaining walls are normally self-draining.

As an example, the International Building Code requires retaining walls to be designed to ensure stability against overturning, sliding, excessive foundation pressure and water uplift; and that they be designed for a safety factor of 1.5 against lateral sliding and overturning.

==Types==

===Gravity===

Gravity walls depend on their mass (stone, concrete or other heavy material) to resist pressure from behind and may have a &#x27;batter&#x27; setback to improve stability by leaning back toward the retained soil. For short landscaping walls, they are often made from mortarless stone or segmental concrete units (masonry units). Dry-stacked gravity walls are somewhat flexible and do not require a rigid footing. They can be built to a low height without additional materials being inserted, and have concrete added for strength and stability. 
Earlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: geosynthetics such as geocell cellular confinement earth retention or with precast facing; gabions (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks); crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber and filled with granular material).

===Cantilevered===
Cantilevered retaining walls are made from an internal stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a beam) to a large, structural footing, converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back, to improve their strength resisting high loads. Buttresses are short wing walls at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth. This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.

===Diaphragm wall===
Diaphragm walls are a type of retaining walls that are very stiff and generally watertight. Diaphragm walls are expensive walls, but they save time and space, and hence are used in urban constructions.

===Sheet piling ===
Sheet pile retaining walls are usually used in soft soil and tight spaces. Sheet pile walls are driven into the ground and are composed of a variety of material including steel, vinyl, aluminum, fiberglass or wood planks. For a quick estimate the material is usually driven 1/3 above ground, 2/3 below ground, but this may be altered depending on the environment. Taller sheet pile walls will need a tie-back anchor, or &quot;dead-man&quot; placed in the soil a distance behind the face of the wall, that is tied to the wall, usually by a cable or a rod. Anchors are then placed behind the potential failure plane in the soil.

===Bored pile ===
Bored pile retaining walls are built by assembling a sequence of bored piles, followed by excavating away the excess soil. 
Depending on the project, the bored pile retaining wall may include a series of earth anchors, reinforcing beams, soil improvement operations and shotcrete reinforcement layer.
This construction technique tends to be employed in scenarios where sheet piling is a valid construction solution, but where the vibration or noise levels generated by a pile driver are not acceptable.

===Anchored===


An anchored retaining wall can be constructed in any of the aforementioned styles but also includes additional strength using cables or other stays anchored in the rock or soil behind it. Usually driven into the material with boring, anchors are then expanded at the end of the cable, either by mechanical means or often by injecting pressurized concrete, which expands to form a bulb in the soil. Technically complex, this method is very useful where high loads are expected, or where the wall itself has to be slender and would otherwise be too weak.

==Alternative retaining techniques==

===Soil nailing===
Soil nailing is a technique in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.

===Soil-strengthened===
A number of systems exist that do not consist of just the wall, but reduce the earth pressure acting directly on the wall. These are usually used in combination with one of the other wall types, though some may only use it as facing, &quot;i.e.&quot;, for visual purposes.
====Gabion meshes====

This type of soil strengthening, often also used without an outside wall, consists of wire mesh &quot;boxes&quot;, which are filled with roughly cut stone or other material. The mesh cages reduce some internal movement and forces, and also reduce erosive forces. 
Gabion walls are free-draining retaining structures and as such are often built in locations where ground water is present. However, management and control of the ground water in and around all retaining walls is important.

===Mechanical stabilization===

Mechanically stabilized earth, also called MSE, is soil constructed with artificial reinforcing via layered horizontal mats (geosynthetics) fixed at their ends. These mats provide added internal shear resistance beyond that of simple gravity wall structures. Other options include steel straps, also layered. This type of soil strengthening usually needs outer facing walls (S.R.W.&#x27;s – Segmental Retaining Walls) to affix the layers to and vice versa.

The wall face is often of precast concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil&#x27;s mass, along with the facing, then acts as an improved gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 50 to 60 percent as deep or thick as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.

Cellular confinement systems (geocells) are also used for steep earth stabilization in gravity and reinforced retaining walls with geogrids. Geocell retaining walls are structurally stable under self- weight and externally imposed loads, while the flexibility of the structure offers very high seismic resistance. The outer fascia cells of the wall can be planted with vegetation to create a green wall.

<text>The African plate, also known as the Nubian plate, is a major tectonic plate that includes most of the continent of Africa (except for its easternmost part) and the adjacent oceanic crust to the west and south. It also includes a narrow strip of Western Asia along the Mediterranean Sea, including much of Israel and Lebanon. It is bounded by the North American plate and South American plate to the west (separated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge); the Arabian plate and Somali plate to the east; the Eurasian plate, Aegean Sea plate and Anatolian plate to the north; and the Antarctic plate to the south.

Between and , the Somali plate began rifting from the African plate along the East African Rift. Since the continent of Africa consists of crust from both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African plate as the &quot;Nubian plate&quot; to distinguish it from the continent as a whole.

==Boundaries==
The western edge of the African plate is a divergent boundary with the North American plate to the north and the South American plate to the south which forms the central and southern part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The African plate is bounded on the northeast by the Arabian plate, the southeast by the Somali plate, the north by the Eurasian plate, the Aegean Sea plate, and the Anatolian plate, and on the south by the Antarctic plate at the Southwest Indian Ridge. All of these are divergent or spreading boundaries with the exception of the northern boundary and a short segment near the Azores known as the Terceira Rift.

==Components==
The African plate includes several cratons, stable blocks of old crust with deep roots in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, and less stable terranes, which came together to form the African continent during the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea around 250 million years ago. The cratons are from south to north, the Kalahari Craton, Congo Craton, Tanzania Craton and West African Craton. The cratons were widely separated in the past, but came together during the Pan-African orogeny and stayed together when Gondwana split up. The cratons are connected by orogenic belts, regions of highly deformed rock where the tectonic plates have engaged. 

The Saharan Metacraton has been tentatively identified as the remains of a craton that has become detached from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, but alternatively may consist of a collection of unrelated crustal fragments swept together during the Pan-African orogeny.

In some areas, the cratons are covered by sedimentary basins, such as the Tindouf Basin, Taoudeni Basin and Congo Basin, where the underlying archaic crust is overlaid by more recent Neoproterozoic sediments. The plate includes shear zones such as the Central African Shear Zone (CASZ) where, in the past, two sections of the crust were moving in opposite directions, and rifts such as the Anza Trough where the crust was pulled apart, and the resulting depression filled with more modern sediment.

==Modern movements==

The African plate is rifting in the eastern interior of the African continent along the East African Rift. This rift zone separates the African plate to the west from the Somali plate to the east. One hypothesis proposes a mantle plume rising beneath the Afar region pushing the crust outward, whereas an opposing hypothesis explains the rifting by dynamics in the crust, as a break in the African plate along a line of maximum weakness as plates to its east move rapidly northward.

The African plate&#x27;s speed is estimated at per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. It is pushing closer to the Eurasian plate, causing subduction where oceanic crust is converging with continental crust (e.g. portions of the central and eastern Mediterranean). In the western Mediterranean, the relative motions of the Eurasian and African plates produce a combination of lateral and compressive forces, concentrated in a zone known as the Azores–Gibraltar Fault Zone. Along its northeast margin, the African plate is bounded by the Red Sea Rift where the Arabian plate is moving away from the African plate.

The New England hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean has probably created a short line of mid- to late-Tertiary age seamounts on the African plate but appears to be currently inactive.

<text>Joe Satrom (born 10 October 1945) is an American businessman and environmental lobbyist from the U.S. state of North Dakota. He won the 2004 Democratic-NPL nomination for governor, but was defeated by the Republican incumbent, John Hoeven.

Satrom was born on his family&#x27;s farm in Broadlawn Township in Steele County, North Dakota. He attended North Dakota State University and was editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper, &quot;The Spectrum&quot;, for two years.

In 1968 Satrom graduated from NDSU with a B.S. in agricultural education. He sat as a delegate to the state Democratic convention that year. Late that year he inquired with Governor Guy about possible positions for him in the administration, and was offered a job as travel director.

In summer of 1969 he married Katherine Platt in Fargo. In 1971 they opened Viking Travel, a travel agency in Bismarck. They sold it a couple of years later. In 1978 Joe and Katherine opened Satrom Travel and Tour as a completely independent travel company, and expanded to eight locations in North Dakota and Montana; all but two were eventually sold.

In 1980 Satrom lost a race to be a representative from District 47, however in 1982 he ran for senate in District 52 and won. He served until 1992.

He is a shareholder and sits on the board of Borgen Systems, a refrigerated display case firm based in Des Moines, Iowa.

Satrom is a member of Ducks Unlimited and the Nature Conservancy.

<text>The Ittihad Party () was an Islamist party in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic that existed from 1917 to 1920. It was formed after the groups Ganja Ittihad-i Islam and Rusyada Muslumanliq merged in September 1917 in opposition to the secular Musavat, and proposed political unity of all of the Muslims within the Russian Empire (&quot;ittihad&quot; in Arabic means &quot;union&quot;). In addition to propagating the legalization of the Sharia law within the Muslim communities, the goal of the Ittihadists was to prevent the formation of independent nation-states by the Muslim ethnic groups of the Russian Empire. In 1918, Ittihad won 11 seats in the Azerbaijani parliament, becoming the second largest party in the legislature by number of seats. The Ittihadists&#x27; vehement opposition to Musavat, which formed the minority government in Azerbaijan in 1918–1920, led to their collaboration with the White Russians under Anton Denikin. Upon the defeat of the latter, Ittihad started leaning politically towards the approaching Bolsheviks who eventually Sovietized Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. By that time, the Ittihad leaders had made a statement declaring the fulfillment of their goals and urging their members to join the newly formed Azerbaijan Communist Party. The leader of the party, Dr. Gara Garabeyov, eventually émigrated to Turkey.

<text>Martin Caidin (September 14, 1927 – March 24, 1997) was an American author, screenwriter, and an authority on aeronautics and aviation.

Caidin began writing fiction in 1957. In his career he authored more than 50 fiction and nonfiction books as well as more than 1,000 magazine articles. His best-known novel is &quot;Cyborg&quot;, which was the basis for &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; franchise. He also wrote numerous works of military history, especially concerning aviation.

Caidin was also an airplane pilot. He bought and restored a 1936 Junkers Ju 52 airplane.

==Fiction==
Caidin&#x27;s fiction incorporated future technological advances that were projected to occur, and examined the political and social repercussions of these innovations. In this respect, his work is similar to that of Michael Crichton. One recurring theme is that of cyborgs, meldings of man and machine, using replacement body parts known as &quot;bionics&quot;. Caidin references bionics in his novel &quot;The God Machine&quot; (1968) and in his most famous novel, &quot;Cyborg&quot; (1972). &quot;Cyborg&quot; was adapted somewhat vaguely as the 1973 television movie &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, the precursor of a television series of the same name. Caidin wrote three sequels to &quot;Cyborg&quot;: &quot;Operation Nuke&quot;, &quot;High Crystal&quot;, and &quot;Cyborg IV&quot;. These novels constitute a different continuity from that of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. (Novelizations of several of the television episodes were written by other authors; these tend to imitate more closely Caidin&#x27;s original version of the Steve Austin character than the less violent television series does.)

Caidin was credited in episodes of the original &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; series, a &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; spinoff, but not in the 2007 remake of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;.

Years later, Caidin would reference bionics in a satirical manner in his novel &quot;Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future&quot;, an adaptation of the pulp fiction and comic strip character Buck Rogers in which Rogers is given bionic parts after being revived from his centuries-long coma.

Caidin&#x27;s 1964 novel &quot;Marooned&quot;, about American astronauts who become stranded in space and NASA&#x27;s subsequent attempt to rescue them, is based on Project Mercury. The book was adapted into a 1969 movie of the same name starring Gregory Peck, Richard Crenna, David Janssen, James Franciscus and Gene Hackman, with Caidin making a brief appearance as a reporter describing the arrival of the rescue vehicle at Cape Canaveral. The movie was based on Project Apollo and Caidin revised his novel in 1969, as a movie novelization, to reflect the change.

World War Two books written by Caidin include &quot;Samurai!&quot;; &quot;Black Thursday&quot;; &quot;Thunderbolt!&quot;; &quot;Fork-Tailed Devil: The P-38&quot;; &quot;Flying Forts&quot;; &quot;Zero!&quot;; &quot;The Ragged, Rugged Warriors&quot;; &quot;A Torch to the Enemy&quot;; and &quot;The Last Dogfight&quot;. Caidin&#x27;s books about space travel include &quot;No Man&#x27;s World&quot;, in which the Soviets beat the Americans to the moon, and &quot;Four Came Back&quot;, about an ill-fated space station for eight crew members. Caidin&#x27;s other books with movie tie-ins include &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; and novels featuring adventurer-archaeologist Indiana Jones. He also wrote the book &quot;Exit Earth&quot;, which was a Noah&#x27;s Ark in space story; he said it was one of his favorite books and he always felt it would be an amazing motion picture.

==Aeronautics==
Caidin bought and restored to full airworthiness the oldest surviving Junkers Ju 52 aircraft, a Ju 52/3m, Serial № 5489, which he named &quot;Iron Annie&quot;. Caidin was pilot-in-command of &quot;Iron Annie&quot; on November 14, 1981, when 19 people walked on one of its wings, a world record. He was one of a small number of pilots to have successfully taken off a Junkers Ju 52 in less than . After touring extensively among shows of vintage military aircraft, or warbirds, &quot;Iron Annie&quot; was sold to Lufthansa during 1984. The airline renamed it &quot;Tempelhof&quot;, and continues to use it today, for charter and VIP flights. Caidin chronicled the warbird restoration movement generally in &quot;Ragwings and Heavy Iron&quot;, and the restoration and further adventures of &quot;Iron Annie&quot; specifically in &quot;The Saga of Iron Annie&quot;. His novel &quot;Jericho 52&quot; also incorporates many of his experiences with &quot;Iron Annie&quot;.

During 1961, Caidin was one of the pilots of a formation flight of B-17s across the Atlantic Ocean, likely the last such flight, from the United States to England via Canada, the Azores, and Portugal. During the voyage, the pilots had a near-miss with a submarine. Caidin recounted this journey in his book &quot;Everything But The Flak&quot;.

Caidin also worked as a pilot for the movie &quot;The War Lover&quot;, flew with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration squadron for several months, and was made an honorary member of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Golden Knights parachute demonstration team.

Additionally, Caidin wrote an aircraft manual for the Messerschmitt Bf 108, which has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration as the standard manual for the plane, and twice won the Aviation/Space Writers Association award for the outstanding author on aviation.

Caidin also established a company with the purpose of promoting aeronautics to young people.

==Talk show host==
During the mid-1980s, Caidin hosted &quot;Face to Face&quot;, a confrontational television talk show in which he challenged representatives of many prominent American far-right organizations and hate groups. The one-hour broadcasts were co-written and produced by Bob Judson, and taped at the Nautilus Television Studios outside of Orlando, Florida. Among those whom Caidin confronted on &quot;Face to Face&quot; were Rabbi Meir Kahane, head of the Jewish Defense League (who would be assassinated a year later in a New York hotel lobby), Matt Koehl, successor to George Lincoln Rockwell as head of the American Nazi Party, Dick Butler of Aryan Nations, journalist Charlie Reese, and John McMann of the John Birch Society. Caidin was a friend of 1960s talk show host Joe Pyne, and used the same confrontational interview style, combined with research.

Caidin also taught a progressive journalism course at the University of Florida in Gainesville, titled Caidin&#x27;s Law.

==Claims of psychic ability==
Caidin, known as a stickler for technical detail, incorporated supernatural elements in his Bermuda Triangle novel &quot;Three Corners To Nowhere&quot; (1975). During the mid-1980s, Caidin began claiming to have the power of telekinesis, specifically, to be able to move one or more small devices called &quot;energy wheels&quot; or &quot;psi wheels&quot;. 
Parapsychologist Loyd Auerbach, a friend of Caidin&#x27;s who sometimes appeared with him in demonstrations and workshops, reiterated a strong endorsement of him in his June 2004 &quot;Fate&quot; magazine column.

The magician James Randi offered to test Caidin&#x27;s claimed abilities during 1994. 
During September 2004, Randi wrote: &quot;He frantically avoided accepting my challenge by refusing even the simplest of proposed control protocols, but he never tired of running on about how I would not test him.&quot;

==Personal life==
Caidin died of thyroid cancer on March 25, 1997 at the age of 69.

<doc id="521101" wikidata="Q2873479" url="?curid=521101" title="Aventura Mall">
<text>Aventura Mall is a shopping mall located in Aventura, Florida. It is the fourth-largest mall in the United States by total square feet of retail space and the largest mall in Florida and the Miami metropolitan area. The mall features JCPenney, Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, and Bloomingdale&#x27;s, in addition to a 24-screen AMC Theatres.

Aventura Mall has more than 50 eateries and restaurants, including Treats Food Hall, and the experiential Arts Aventura Mall program.

The Brightline Aventura Station, which opened in December 2022, is located across Biscayne Boulevard from the mall. A pedestrian bridge across Biscayne Blvd. is planned, to provide direct access to the mall from the station. In the interim, Brightline provided free shuttle bus service for some time, and the price is $1.3 billion.

==History==
In April 1983, the Oxford Development Company, led by partners Donald Soffer, Edward J. Lewis, Mark E. Mason, Eugene Lebowitz, and Ray Parello officially dedicated Aventura Mall. There would be four anchors in the original, , complex: Lord &amp; Taylor, JCPenney (opened April 28, 1983), Sears (opened July 6, 1983, three weeks after another at Miami International Mall), and Macy&#x27;s opened October 1, 1983.

On board as an original investor in the project was mall-developer Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. The mall was originally designed to accommodate a fifth anchor, and there was a section of drywall in a place where its mall entrance would be located.

Soon after its construction, Soffer left Oxford. As part of the break-up of assets, Soffer&#x27;s new firm, Turnberry Associates assumed control of the Aventura Mall. In 1996, the DeBartolo Realty Corporation, which owned the minority interest once held by Edward J. DeBartolo, was acquired by Simon Property Group.

In 1996, the ground was broken for a major expansion of Aventura Mall. The addition, built onto the southeast end of the existing complex, consisted of a three-story atrium with an multiplex cinema and restaurants at a new entrance. Part of the new development were two three-story parking garages surrounding the new anchor stores&#x27; southeast facades.

The Mall continued to expand, with major additions being added in November 1997 and August 1999. The mall underwent a $20 million renovation in late 2006. The mall expanded again in 2017 by opening a new three-level, expansion wing.

In March 2019, LEVEL THREE, a venue designed by Carlos Zapata, was launched.

By 2023, since the government lockdown, Aventura Mall had announced several newest additions, among them are Mango, Dr. Martens, Vuori, Garage, Aesop, Hermès, Balenciaga, Armani Exchange, BVLGARI, and Valentino.

==Incidents==
On May 29, 2020, two people were taken to the Aventura Hospital after a shooting incident occurred in the Nordstrom part of the Aventura Mall.

On May 8, 2021, a shooting incident occurred near Nordstrom in the Aventura Mall. The shooter was arrested.

<doc id="521115" wikidata="Q1000502" url="?curid=521115" title="Bud Olson">
<text>Horace Andrew &quot;Bud&quot; Olson (October 6, 1925 – February 14, 2002) was a Canadian businessman and politician from Alberta. He served as the 14th Lieutenant Governor of Alberta from 1996 to 2000. He also served as a Member of Parliament, Senator, Minister of Agriculture, and Minister of Economic and Regional Development. He was also a farmer and rancher, and president and operating officer of Farmer&#x27;s Stockmen&#x27;s Supplies in Medicine Hat and Lethbridge, Alberta.

==Early life==
Born in Iddesleigh, Alberta on October 6, 1925. On January 27, 1947, he married Marion Lucille McLachlan. They had four children: Sharon Lee, Andrea Lucille, Juanita Carol and Horace Andrew Jr.

==Federal politics==
Bud Olson was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1957 election as a Social Credit Member of Parliament (MP) from Medicine Hat. He was defeated in the Diefenbaker Progressive Conservatives&#x27; sweep of 1958, but re-elected in 1962, 1963, and 1965.

With the Social Credit Party&#x27;s English Canadian wing rapidly disintegrating, Olson crossed the floor in 1967 to join the Liberal Party. Olson supported Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s successful candidacy for the Liberal leadership in 1968, narrowly won re-election as an MP in 1968 and became minister of agriculture in the first Trudeau government. Olson served in that position until he was heavily defeated by PC challenger Bert Hargrave in the 1972 general election. He was one of only three Liberal MPs elected from Alberta in 1968; all were defeated in 1972. To date, Olson is the last Liberal elected from a rural Alberta riding.

Olson sought a rematch against Hargrave in 1974, but lost by a margin almost as large as he had in 1972. In 1977, Trudeau appointed him to the Senate of Canada. Olson served as leader of the opposition in the Senate in 1979, and returned to Cabinet when the Trudeau Liberals returned to power in 1980.

He served as Minister of Economic and Regional Development from 1980 to 1984, as well as Leader of the Government in the Senate. As one of Trudeau&#x27;s most powerful ministers, he chaired the cabinet committee on economic development from 1980 to 1983. He was also the minister responsible for the Northern Pipeline Agency from 1980 to 1984, and the government leader in the Senate from 1982 to 1984. It was also Olson&#x27;s job to promote the government&#x27;s unpopular National Energy Program in Alberta.

==Late life==
Olson resigned from the Senate when he was appointed Alberta&#x27;s 14th Lieutenant-Governor in April 1996. He served in that position until 2000.

Bud Olson died in Medicine Hat in 2002.

<doc id="521116" wikidata="Q93662" url="?curid=521116" title="St. Bonaventure University">
<text>St. Bonaventure University is a private Franciscan university in St. Bonaventure, New York. It has 2,760 undergraduate and graduate students. The Franciscans established the university in 1858.

In athletics, the St. Bonaventure Bonnies play National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I sports in the Atlantic 10 Conference. Students and alumni often refer to the university as &quot;Bona&#x27;s&quot;, derived from the school&#x27;s name.

==History==
The college was founded by Utica, New York, financier Nicholas Devereux, one of the first to gain land grants in newly surveyed Cattaraugus County from the Holland Land Company. Devereux founded the town of Allegany on the grant, hoping to build a new city. Devereux approached John Timon, the bishop of Buffalo, for assistance. The two invited the Franciscan order to Western New York, and a small group under Pamfilo da Magliano arrived in 1855. The school graduated its first class in 1858. St. Bonaventure&#x27;s College was granted university status by New York State in 1950. The largest residence hall on campus, Devereux Hall, is named for the founder.

=== The Franciscan connection ===
The university is named after Bonaventure (1221–1274), born John of Fidenza, who became a cardinal and Doctor of the Church. A theologian and contemporary of Thomas Aquinas at the University of Paris, he became head of the Franciscan order. Bonaventure was canonized in 1482 by Sixtus IV. The Franciscan friars at the St. Bonaventure Friary belong to the Holy Name Province and are members of the Order of Friars Minor, one of the orders of Franciscans.

The university is also home to the Franciscan Institute. Founded in 1939 by Thomas Plassmann, then president of St. Bonaventure&#x27;s College, and led by its first director, Philotheus Boehner.

==Campus==

The campus sits on in the town of Allegany, just over the line from the city of Olean (total pop.: 15,000), at Exit 24 of Interstate 86. The university has its own US Post Office and is listed as a separate census-designated place by the Census Bureau. The university&#x27;s postal address is Saint Bonaventure, NY 14778. 

==Academics==
The university has more than 50 academic programs, including programs in the Jandoli School of Communication, School of Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Business, School of Education, and The Dennis R. DePerro School of Health Professions.

=== Research ===
St. Bonaventure also has the Center for the Study of Attention, Learning &amp; Memory, a joint initiative between the School of Education and the School of Arts and Sciences, promotes interdisciplinary research and increases awareness of the importance of attention and learning in education. The university also hosts the Franciscan Institute, which provides grants for research on the history and theology of the Franciscan Order.

=== Rankings ===
In the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2025 rankings of colleges and universities, St. Bonaventure University was ranked nineteenth (tie) among &quot;Regional Universities North&quot; and eighth in &quot;Best Value Schools&quot;.

== Student life ==

=== Media ===
The campus newspaper, &quot;The Bona Venture&quot;, has been published continuously since 1926. Known on campus as The BV, the newspaper has earned The Pacemaker Award numerous times from the Associated Collegiate Press, the last time in 1994. The school&#x27;s student radio station is known as WSBU 88.3 The Buzz. In 2019, the Jandoli School of Communication&#x27;s student-produced newscast, &quot;SBU-TV&quot;, became available to television viewers across Western New York.

=== Popular folklore ===
Thomas Merton, the Catholic monk and writer, taught English at St. Bonaventure for a year just at the start of World War II, living on campus on the second floor of Devereux Hall. It was at this school that Merton finally gave into his vocation and decided to join the Trappists. He entered the monastery in Kentucky in 1941. A heart-shaped clearing on a mountain in view of campus is linked to Merton in campus myth. Some students call it &quot;Merton&#x27;s Heart&quot; and claim that Merton visited the place often and that the trees fell when he died. In reality, the hillside had been cleared for oil drilling in the 1920s and trees have since regrown, leaving the bald patch.

== Athletics ==
St. Bonaventure is an NCAA Division I member of the Atlantic 10 Conference and offers 19 varsity athletic programs. The school&#x27;s programs are known as the Bonnies. The men&#x27;s team has reached the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament a total of 8 times, most recently in the 2020–2021 season.

==Notable alumni==

Six alumni of the university have received the Pulitzer Prize, including Dan Barry (1980), Bill Briggs (1985), Robert A. Dubill (1958), John Hanchette (1964), Charles J. Hanley (1968), and Brian Toolan (1972).

<doc id="521124" wikidata="Q4354593" url="?curid=521124" title="Harry Kalas">
<text>Harold Norbert Kalas (March 26, 1936 – April 13, 2009) was an American sportscaster, best known for his Ford C. Frick Award-winning role as lead play-by-play announcer for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB), a position he held from 1971 until his death in 2009.

Kalas was also closely identified with the National Football League (NFL), serving as a voice-over narrator for NFL Films productions (a regular feature on &quot;Inside the NFL&quot;) and calling football games nationally for Westwood One radio.

==Early life and education==
Kalas was born in Chicago, on March 26, 1936, the son of a Methodist minister of Greek descent, Kalas graduated from Naperville High School in 1954 and from the University of Iowa in 1959. As the University of Iowa, he was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

==Career==
After graduating from the University of Iowa, Kalas was immediately drafted into the United States Army and stationed in Hawaii. 

After his discharge in 1961, Kalas began calling Minor League baseball games for the Hawaii Islanders.

===Houston Astros===
In 1965, Kalas made his Major League Baseball broadcasting debut with the Houston Astros, replacing Al Helfer and working alongside Gene Elston and Loel Passe. He called the first game at the Houston Astrodome, on April 12, 1965.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
In 1971, Kalas was hired by the Phillies in 1971 to succeed Bill Campbell, and was the master of ceremonies at the 1971 opening of Veterans Stadium. After the retirement of By Saam, Kalas was paired with Andy Musser and Hall of Fame player Richie Ashburn.

While initially meeting with a lukewarm reception due to his replacement of the popular Campbell, Kalas soon won the hearts of Phillies fans with his easy-going style, his mellow, baritone, leathery voice (which rose to great excitement upon great plays on the field or Phillies&#x27; home runs, especially in key situations), his love of the game and also his accessibility to Phillies fans, for whom he professed a strong love.

During his Phillies career, he called six no-hit games, six National League Championship Series, and three World Series (1983, 1993, and 2008). However, due to MLB rules at the time, he could not call the 1980 World Series, as local broadcasters were not allowed to call games due to contract conflicts with MLB, NBC and CBS Radio. Public outcry caused MLB to change its policies the following year.

Kalas also called the first game at Veterans Stadium (April 10, 1971), the last game at Veterans Stadium (September 28, 2003), and the first game at Citizens Bank Park (April 12, 2004).

Kalas was sidelined for a few days in late July 2008 to treat a detached retina.

On April 8, 2009, the Phillies honored Kalas by having him throw out the first pitch before a game against the Atlanta Braves. Kalas&#x27;s pitch was part of the pre-game ceremony in which the Phillies received their 2008 World Series championship rings. The ceremony would be part of Kalas&#x27;s last home game.

On May 15, 2009, during a series in Washington, the Phillies visited the White House and were congratulated by President Barack Obama for their 2008 World Series championship. The visit had been postponed from April 14, due to Kalas&#x27;s death the preceding day. The President mentioned Kalas, his voice, his love for the Phillies, and his legacy. This was the second of two tributes to Kalas in Washington. On April 21, eight days after Kalas&#x27;s death, then–U.S. Congressman Joe Sestak paid tribute to Kalas in the House of Representatives. At the time, Sestak represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 7th congressional district, where Kalas resided.

====Richie Ashburn====

Kalas and Ashburn became beloved figures in Philadelphia, and also became best friends. They worked together for 27 seasons until Ashburn&#x27;s death on September 9, 1997, of a heart attack in his sleep in a room at the Grand Hyatt New York after broadcasting a Phillies/Mets game at Shea Stadium. It is believed by many that Kalas never got over the death of his partner and friend, openly stating more than 11 years afterward that he still grieved over Ashburn&#x27;s death.

====Memorable calls====

Kalas&#x27; familiar home run call was &quot;Swing ... and a long drive, this ball is ... outta here! Home run Ryan Howard!&quot;
If it was a gigantic home run, he sometimes inserted &quot;deep (left center)&quot; after &quot;and a long drive&quot; and described it as &quot;that ball&#x27;s way outta here!&quot;

As a guest on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; on July 15, 2007, Kalas recounted that his famous &quot;outta here&quot; call originated in the mid-1970s. While standing around the batting cage during batting practice, he saw Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski hit a ball into the upper deck, to which Philly shortstop Larry Bowa reacted with the words, &quot;Wow! That&#x27;s way outta here.&quot; Kalas said that it had a nice &quot;unique ring to it and has been using it ever since&quot;.

Other broadcasters have used Kalas&#x27; &quot;outta here&quot; call, including Gary Cohen of the New York Mets, Jerry Coleman of the San Diego Padres, Duane Kuiper of the San Francisco Giants and Terry Smith of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

Kalas made, arguably, his most memorable call on April 18, 1987, when Mike Schmidt hit his 500th career home run. 

In 1980, after the Phillies won the World Series, Kalas and the rest of the Phillies&#x27; radio crew re-created the call that Kalas probably would have made when Tug McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to win Game 6 and the World Series between the Phillies and the Kansas City Royals. 

This call was not made live by Kalas, as MLB radio-broadcasting regulations at the time forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games, instead forcing them to air the national CBS Radio feed of the games. Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter-writing campaign to the Commissioner&#x27;s Office, demanding a change to the rule. Due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans, MLB amended its broadcasting contracts the following year to allow World Series teams&#x27; flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers. Nevertheless, Kalas was part of the Phillies&#x27; World Series celebration in 1980, and rode in the team&#x27;s victory parade down Broad Street.

Kalas did call the 1980 NLCS, but his call of the final out was partially drowned out by Tim McCarver&#x27;s laughter. An exciting call from an otherwise forgettable season occurred in May 1989, when, on a Phillies team that would finish last, Bob Dernier hit a walk-off, 3-run inside-the-park home run against the eventual National League Champion Giants:&quot;Swing and a line drive, it&#x27;s a fair ball down the left field line, going on the way to the corner. Here comes Thon in to score; Lake being waved around! Mitchell can&#x27;t pick it up! Lake scores -- here comes Dernier!! The throw to the plate -- safe!! I can&#x27;t believe it!! The Phillies have won 3 to 2 in the bottom half of the 12th inning!! Incredible! Mitchell could not pick the ball up down in the left field corner! It kicked away from him! Dernier circled the bases! The Phillies have won 3 to 2 in the 12th! Would you believe it!?&quot;Kalas called a grand slam home run by Mariano Duncan off Lee Smith in 1993:
Another memorable call by Kalas was his description of Mitch Williams&#x27;s strikeout of Bill Pecota for the final out of Game 6 of the 1993 National League Championship Series between the Phillies and Atlanta Braves:
Another of Kalas&#x27; famous calls came less than two weeks later with Joe Carter&#x27;s famous walk-off home run to end the World Series, though the Phillies lost the series: 

On April 4, 2003, Kalas called a grand slam by Chase Utley in Utley&#x27;s major-league debut:
On June 14, 2004, Kalas called the 400th home run hit by Jim Thome, using the call he used in later years when it was uncertain whether the ball would clear the fence: 

On September 8, 2005, Kalas calls an eventual game-winning 3-run home run by Craig Biggio in top of the 9th off Billy Wagner.
On August 9, 2006, Kalas called a close play at the plate as Chase Utley scored from second base on a routine groundout against the Atlanta Braves: 

Here is Kalas&#x27;s call of Brett Myers&#x27; strikeout of Washington&#x27;s Wily Mo Pena to clinch the 2007 National League East division title for the Phillies on the last day of the season, completing a comeback as they erased a seven-game deficit behind the New York Mets in early September: 

Kalas&#x27; call on the Phillies&#x27; victory in Game 5 of the 2008 NLCS:
On October 29, 2008, Kalas was finally able to call a Phillies&#x27; championship-winning moment in the World Series when Brad Lidge struck out Eric Hinske to win the 104th Fall Classic:

Kalas made his final call on April 12, 2009, during the Phillies game against the Colorado Rockies:
====Miscellany====
Kalas was known for his love of the Frank Sinatra song, &quot;High Hopes&quot;, a melody he sang at numerous events, including the Phillies&#x27; championship celebrations in his later years. His most famous singing of &quot;High Hopes&quot; came in 1993 when he sang to the team after they clinched the NL East division title. On April 17, 2009, at the first home game after Kalas&#x27;s death, fans sang along with a video of Harry singing &quot;High Hopes&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch, instead of the traditional &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;.

Kalas had sung &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch at Wrigley Field in Chicago on several occasions in tribute to Harry Caray, the late voice of the Chicago Cubs, who had led fans in that song at most home games. However, by that time, Kalas, a native of the Chicago area, had become an openly avid Phillies fan, and held the microphone out to the audience to hear them sing &quot;the Cubbies&quot; as they replaced their team&#x27;s name for &quot;the home team&quot; in the song&#x27;s lyrics.

Kalas, due to his stay in Hawaii, was very proficient at pronouncing Polynesian names. He also liked to slowly enunciate certain players&#x27; names, especially those with ethnic names. His personal favorite, Mickey Morandini, was pronounced as &quot;Mi-ckey Mor-an-DI-ni&quot;.

Kalas attributed his leathery voice to his habit of smoking Parliament cigarettes, and some of the Phillies players lit up Parliaments after Kalas&#x27; death as a tribute.

===NFL Films===
Kalas joined NFL Films as a narrator in 1975. He became its primary voice, following the passing of John Facenda in 1984. He provided the narration to the highlights on &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; from its inception in 1976 through the 2008 season. Following Kalas&#x27; death, fellow Philadelphia Phillies announcer Scott Graham took over his &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; duties.

===Other ventures===
In addition to his work with the Phillies and NFL Films, Kalas called various sports over the years for the Mutual Broadcasting System, CBS Radio, and Westwood One Radio (including the NFL, MLB, college basketball, and Notre Dame football). Kalas joined Dennis Green to call the 1985 Aloha Bowl between Alabama and USC. For many years, he narrated the &quot;Alcoa Fantastic Finishes&quot; in-game highlights spots, for use during NFL telecasts. His voice was used for narration of WLVT-TV&#x27;s documentary on the Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry, produced in 2004. Kalas also lent his voice to NFL Network&#x27;s game telecasts, reading sponsor plugs during commercial breaks. He was replaced by Pat Summerall after his death.

Along with Joe Kapp, Kalas called the 1982 Liberty Bowl...the last game of Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant&#x27;s career and his 323rd victory.

Kalas also lent his voice to the commercials for the movie &quot;Leatherheads&quot;, as well as commercials for the Campbell Soup Company, including Campbell&#x27;s Chunky Soup, GMC Truck, Sega Genesis Sports Games, Coors Light, and others.

Kalas provided the recorded voice-over for much of the self-guided tours at the United States Mint in Philadelphia and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis.

He also narrated/commentated Animal Planet&#x27;s Puppy Bowls I-V from 2005 to 2009. Puppy Bowl VI was dedicated in his memory.

He also made an appearance on the song &quot;Rain Delay&quot; by the Philadelphia-based rock group Marah.

==Personal life==
Kalas had three sons: Todd, Brad, and Kane. Todd is a former Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster, who worked as a pregame/postgame–show host and is currently a play-by-play announcer for the Houston Astros. Kane is a professional poker player.

==Death==


Kalas died of heart disease on Monday, April 13, 2009, in Washington, D.C. He collapsed in the Nationals Park press box at approximately 12:30 pm, several hours before the Washington Nationals&#x27; home opener against the Phillies. Kalas was rushed to George Washington University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:20 pm EDT. 

&quot;We lost Harry [today],&quot; David Montgomery, the team president, said. &quot;We lost our voice.&quot; Before the game began, Kalas&#x27;s death was announced to the crowd, his picture was displayed on the scoreboard, and the stadium observed a minute of silence. The Phillies went on to win the game, 9–8. The Phillies saluted Kalas by placing a picture of him in their dugout during the game. Center fielder Shane Victorino also saluted Kalas after hitting a solo home run by pointing up to the press box where Kalas would have called the game. Phillies fans created a makeshift memorial at the Mike Schmidt statue outside Citizens Bank Park at the Third Base Gate shortly after Kalas&#x27;s death was announced.

Kalas suffered from atherosclerosis and hypertension in his later years, but those illnesses did not seem to affect his announcing abilities; he called the Phillies&#x27; Rockies game in Denver on April 12, the day before his death. Kalas was in his 39th season with the Phillies.

Though the Phillies were scheduled to visit the White House on April 14 to celebrate their 2008 World Series championship, the visit was postponed so that the day could be set aside to remember Kalas. Their White House visit was pushed back to May 15, coinciding with the Phillies&#x27; next scheduled visit to Washington, D.C. to play the Nationals.

On Friday, April 17, 2009, following Kalas&#x27; death, his three children, Todd (himself a former Phillies broadcaster), Brad, and Kane, threw out the ceremonial first pitches before the Phillies first home game at Citizens Bank Park to Mike Schmidt, John Kruk, and Jimmy Rollins, representatives of the three decades of Phillies baseball with Kalas. After a moment of silence, Kane sang the national anthem.

The next day, Kalas became the fourth person to be given the honor of having their body lie in repose inside a Major League Baseball stadium after Babe Ruth, Jack Buck, and Miller Huggins. Kalas&#x27;s casket was displayed behind home plate and fans were encouraged to pay their respects at Citizens Bank Park. Friends, broadcast partners, and every player on the Phillies team roster paid their respects before it was placed in a hearse, which carried him out of Citizens Bank Park one final time.

Kalas was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. In August 2009, two pairs of seats from Veterans Stadium were installed at his graveside, one pair on each side, facing each other at a 45° angle. In the summer of 2010, a headstone was added to the grave, and the fan-made plywood &quot;P&quot; was removed as was the bronze plaque with his likeness. The headstone consists of a granite microphone with the letters &quot;HK&quot; in the middle and a likeness of Kalas&#x27; autograph, which includes the &quot;HOF 2002&quot; that Kalas added to his autographs after his receipt of the Ford C. Frick Award, at the microphone&#x27;s base, and that sits on top of a raised base shaped like a home plate. Engraved in the base are the following words:

On September 29, 2010, Kalas&#x27;s grave was resurfaced with sod that originally came from Citizens Bank Park, which was previously removed for the 2009 season when that stadium was re-sodded. The sod had been preserved in live condition for sale to fans at a southern New Jersey sod farm that deals in sod for sports arenas. That farm donated a portion of the former Citizens Bank Park sod when a fan, who volunteers at Laurel Hill Cemetery, contacted that farm regarding using that sod on Kalas&#x27;s grave in Kalas&#x27;s memory, as Kalas himself had walked on that sod, and had called the 2008 World Series victory which had come on that very grass.

During the winter of 2011–2012, a baseball quote by A. Bartlett Giamatti was added to the top of the home plate-shaped plinth of the tombstone. It reads, 

==Honors==
Nicknamed &quot;Harry the K&quot; by Phillies pitcher Larry Christenson in the mid-1970s, a nickname quickly adopted by Phillies fans, Kalas received the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2004, he was named Person of the Year by the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia. That year, he was also inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame, as a member of the charter class (21 members). He was named Pennsylvania Sportscaster of the Year 18 times.

Kalas also helped announce the ceremonial closing of Veterans Stadium on September 28, 2003, and was the master of ceremonies at the ceremonial opening of Citizens Bank Park in 2004.

At Citizens Bank Park, the restaurant built into the base of the main scoreboard is named &quot;Harry the K&#x27;s&quot; in Kalas&#x27;s honor. After Kalas&#x27;s death, the Phillies&#x27; TV-broadcast booth was renamed &quot;The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth&quot;. It is directly next to the radio-broadcast booth, which is named &quot;The Richie &#x27;Whitey&#x27; Ashburn Broadcast Booth&quot;.

When Kalas died on April 13, 2009, fans created an impromptu memorial tribute to him at the base of the statue of Mike Schmidt at the Third Base Gate of Citizens Bank Park.

The Phillies honored Kalas for the remainder of the 2009 season with a round, black &quot;HK&quot; patch over the heart on all player, coach, and manager jerseys. Additionally, a billboard featuring a microphone, his initials and lifespan (&quot;HK 1936–2009&quot;) was displayed on the wall in left-center field during the 2009 season.

Immediately after the Phillies clinched the National League Eastern Division, the players all went to the billboard, lit cigars and poured beer and champagne on the billboard as a symbolic way of including Kalas in the celebration, as Kalas had participated in all of the Phillies&#x27; victory celebrations during his tenure in Philadelphia, including both World Series wins, having ridden in both of the Phillies World Series parades.

The Phillies players, led by Shane Victorino, hung Kalas&#x27; signature baby-blue blazer and white loafers in the dugout for every game.

Following Kalas&#x27; death, the Phillies began playing a video of Kalas singing the first verse of &quot;High Hopes&quot; at Citizens Bank Park after every Phillies win, as well as playing Kalas&#x27;s famous &quot;This ball is outta here!&quot; call at Citizens Bank Park after every Phillies home run.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Kalas into their Hall of fame in 2000 and named him their Person of the Year in 2004.

In 2009, Kalas was that year&#x27;s inductee into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame.

In June 2009, the National Radio Hall of Fame announced that Kalas would be posthumously inducted into its Hall of Fame. Thirteen other sportscasters were previously inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Phillies fan Antonio Jose initiated an online petition seeking support for a statue of Kalas to be erected outside the Phillies&#x27; ballpark. As of May 2010, there were 24,000 signatories. Sculptor Lawrence Nowlan designed a model for the statue. In September 2010, a story that aired on the &quot;10 Show&quot; on WCAU-TV stated that the full-size clay model for the statue was nearly complete, and was ready to have a mold of it cast so the actual bronze statue can be cast.

On Tuesday, August 16, 2011, the Nowlan sculpture, a bronze statue (which depicts Kalas standing cross-legged on a home plate, holding a microphone in his right hand, which also holds a baseball bat that he was leaning upon) was unveiled in the Ashburn Alley outfield concourse at Citizens Bank Park between Harry the K&#x27;s Restaurant and the statue of Richie Ashburn prior to that evening&#x27;s game versus the Arizona Diamondbacks. This unveiling was postponed from the previous Sunday, when the statue was scheduled to be unveiled prior to the game versus the Washington Nationals, which had been rained out.

The 2010 Mummers Parade on New Year&#x27;s Day featured the Happy Tappers Comics dressed as Phillies players with the &quot;HK&quot; patch on the Phillies jerseys to pay tribute to Kalas and their theme was &quot;Harry K&#x27;s Field of Dreams.&quot;

<text>Xanga () was a website that hosted weblogs, photoblogs, and social networking profiles. It was operated by Xanga.com, Inc. and based in New York City.

==History==

Xanga began in 1999 as a site for sharing book and music reviews. It became public in 2000, following a series of e-mail recruitment methods via GeoCities. Over the next few years, Xanga underwent several formatting changes. Featured Content was divided in 2002, being replaced by Premium and Classic views. Eventually, new profile features such as friends, &quot;nudges&quot;, and chat forums that resemble Facebook were added, and video and audio capability were added in 2006. In 2013, Xanga was under threat of shutting down unless it raised $60k by mid-July (for &quot;Xanga 2.0&quot;). Failing to reach that goal, Xanga became an un-navigatable page in late 2013.

==Core features==
Xanga members received a &quot;Xanga Site&quot;, a website containing a weblog, photoblog, videoblog, audioblog, &quot;Pulse&quot; (mini-blog), and social networking profile. Members could also make or join blogrings (groups).

===Weblog===
Xanga first added weblogs to Xanga Sites on November 5, 2000. Comments were added soon after, on December 8, 2000, along with &quot;eProps&quot;, which a user could give to another user&#x27;s entry to show they enjoyed it. 

A core part of Xanga was the ability to subscribe to other Xanga Sites. Subscriptions allowed Xanga users to stay up-to-date on other Xangas they were subscribed to, without needing to manually visit each site. Xanga added an email subscriptions feature on November 30, 2000. In January 2001, this was followed by the ability to subscribe to a site using RSS and the ability to display subscriptions on one&#x27;s site.

Initially, Xanga allowed members to subscribe to each other&#x27;s sites anonymously. Some users were troubled by anonymous subscriptions, and so during the week of July 15, 2003, support for this feature was discontinued. Since some users had been using anonymous subscriptions to try out subscriptions to other sites, on July 21, 2003, Xanga added a feature that allows members to sample a Trial Subscription to another site. This update also allowed members to hide individual subscriptions from public display.

Subscriptions were originally called &quot;Sites I Read&quot;, sometimes abbreviated to &quot;SIR&quot;.

===Photoblog===
Until the spring of 2006, Xanga&#x27;s photo features were focused on enabling photo uploads within weblog posts. Xanga first started offering photo uploading on May 1, 2001. Originally, photo uploading was available only to premium members, and was limited to 20 MB of storage (although this was not enforced). On April 7, 2005, Xanga overhauled its photo system to increase picture quality and size, as well as to increase capacity for the system overall. This was followed, on August 5, 2005, with the beta release of a new Photo Manager that allowed users to more easily edit and view their photos.

On August 30, 2005, Xanga announced that all premium members would now get a gigabyte of photo storage. On September 9, 2005, web-based batch uploading of photos was added; on September 26, 2005, all Xanga Classic members were given 1 gigabyte of free photo storage and Premium members were increased to two gigabytes of storage. On September 28, 2005, moblogging support was added.

Xanga released its photoblog offering on April 6, 2006; the ability to comment on photoblog posts followed on April 28, 2006. On May 18, 2006, Xanga introduced new tools that streamlined batch publishing to a photoblog.

===Videoblog===
Xanga Videoblogs were officially launched on August 9, 2007 with a video featuring Xanga employee Chris Choi&#x27;s dog Gromit.

===Audioblog===
On September 29, 2006, Xanga launched Audio Blogs after about a month of beta testing.

===Pulse===
On February 22, 2007, Xanga introduced &quot;Pulse&quot;, which was described as a &quot;carefree miniblog&quot;. A Pulse message can also be uploaded by cell phone.

===Profile===
Xanga supported limited profiles as early as its launch in 2000. Profiles were revamped on February 1, 2004, to hold more information and offer better email security and control. Each member was allowed to upload one profile picture. On April 30, 2004, Xanga upgraded its profile image uploading to offer better quality images. Then on July 27, 2004, Xanga followed up with allowing the uploading of multiple profile pictures; classic members were allowed to upload up to 3 profile pictures, while Premium members were allowed to upload up to 99 profile pictures. Xangans were allowed to set a default picture that would appear next to their username, as well as choose between their profile pictures in each entry. Then, on November 19, 2004, Xanga extended its support of multiple profile pictures to comment icons; now Xanga users could choose which profile picture they wanted to appear next to each of their comments.

Then on April 6, 2006, Xanga upgraded its profiles to offer traditional social networking features—including the ability to connect with friends, to search for friends, and to fill out profile fields. On June 6, 2006, a link to each users&#x27; profile was added to the standard Xanga navigation at the top of every Xanga site (along with Photos).

Xanga profiles also include Memories, Nudge, and a Chatboard.

==Revenue==

===Premium subscriptions===
Xanga offered two levels of premium subscriptions: Premium and Premium Plus. Members who subscribed to either service received additional features, including additional photo storage and monthly uploads.

The Premium plan provided 2 GB of photo storage and 100 MB of monthly uploads while the Premium Plus plan provided unlimited photo storage and 1GB of monthly uploads. Premium members on both plans could customize their site using skins, post entries to their site via electronic mail, and download archives of their entries. Pages of Premium members did not contain web banners. Some other Premium features included a higher limit on profile pictures, a custom sidebar, and specialized page skins.

Xanga Premium was first launched on May 1, 2001, largely consisting of 20 MB of photo hosting (although limits on photos were not enforced). A downloadable archive of entries and comments was added to the premium offering on May 10, 2001, while customizable Skins were added on February 15, 2002.

Payment options for Premium grew over time. When Premium first launched on May 1, 2001, Xangans could pay for Premium only with a credit card. Support for check payments was added on April 15, 2002, while support for PayPal was added on May 13, 2002. Support for gifting of Premium was added on December 23, 2001. The Premium Plus plan was added on November 8, 2005.

Xanga Premium later increased to 10 GB of storage space.

===Advertising===
Xanga was largely supported by advertising, in the form of banner ads that appear on the top of most pages on Xanga. Xanga ads first appeared on the site on May 30, 2001. On September 21, 2005, the ads were changed to a larger leaderboard format.

<doc id="521145" wikidata="Q2262288" url="?curid=521145" title="Blindfold">
<text>A blindfold (from Middle English &quot;&quot;) is a garment, usually of cloth, tied to one&#x27;s head to cover the eyes to disable the wearer&#x27;s sight. While a properly fitted blindfold prevents sight even if the eyes are open, a poorly tied or trick blindfold may let the wearer see around or even through the blindfold.

==Applications==

Blindfolds can be used in various applications:

* As a sleep mask: They block out light when sleeping, especially during air travel, or for those who sleep during the day, given that shutting out light allows the user to achieve a deeper level of sleep. They can also provide relief from claustrophobia for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patients.
* In children&#x27;s games, such as Pin the Tail on the Donkey and when hitting a piñata.
* During both martial arts and weight lifting, to encourage reliance on other senses, such as touch or hearing.
* As a sensory deprivation tool in meditation, to focus attention on oneself rather than outside imagery.
* As a way to keep a kidnapping victim, hostage, prisoner, etc., from being able to identify locations or people.
* To cover the eyes of a blind person for health or cosmetic reasons. (Since the invention of sunglasses, this is much less common.)
* As a prop in magic tricks. One common trick involves a blindfolded performer doing a task that requires vision, such as driving.
* As an aid to simulate blindness during training of Orientation and Mobility Specialists, so that they develop empathetic understanding of blindness and learn how to rely on their other senses to get to know the environment and move around freely and independently.
* During executions, to relax and calm the accused, as they will be unable to see their execution and thus less likely to panic.
* Sexual activity may include blindfolding. They can be constructed with feathers and sold with handcuffs in novelty &quot;bondage kits&quot;. Many impromptu items already found in the bedroom lend themselves to such use without preparation or prior purchase of specialized equipment.

Use of a blindfold is said to enhance the remaining senses of the wearer, focusing attention on sound, smells and physical contact. This increased awareness is said to allow for greater excitement and anticipation by eliminating visual cues, as one cannot see what to expect. It also requires trust of the submissive, with all the emotional ramifications that entails.

==Symbolism==
The blindfold has been a powerful symbol in divination and mythology since the 15th century.

In law, it is seen being worn by Lady Justice, to represent objectivity and impartiality.

The blindfold as a symbol is also a common theme in tarot and other divination methods. It can represent themes of the victim, resistance to clarity, denial, or limited views. It is often accompanied by underlying themes of integrity and truth at a cost. Likewise, the icon of the blindfold can symbolize the dichotomy of the conscious and the unconscious, as wearing a blindfold represents a stasis or a lesser state of consciousness, whereas taking off one&#x27;s blindfold represents a form of awakening or rebirth. It also represents connection to feeling over senses, emphasizing the importance of emotion over perception.

<doc id="521153" wikidata="Q3404596" url="?curid=521153" title="Ford C. Frick Award">
<text>The Ford C. Frick Award is presented annually by the Baseball Hall of Fame in the United States to a broadcaster for &quot;major contributions to baseball&quot;. It is named for Ford C. Frick, former commissioner of baseball. Prior to his career as an executive, Frick was a baseball writer and occasional broadcaster; he gained fame as a ghostwriter for Babe Ruth in the 1920s. The award was created in 1978, and named in tribute to Frick following his death that year.

Recipients of the award are not members of the Hall of Fame—they are not &quot;inducted&quot; or &quot;enshrined&quot;, they are not &quot;Hall of Fame broadcasters&quot;, and there is no &quot;broadcasters&#x27; wing&quot; of the Hall of Fame—they are officially &quot;honorees.&quot; The award is given at a separate ceremony from the induction ceremony on Hall of Fame weekend. As with recipients of the BBWAA Career Excellence Award for baseball writing, the honorees are permanently recognized in a &quot;Scribes &amp; Mikemen&quot; exhibit in the Hall&#x27;s library. 
==Selection==
Detail on the selection process for the award when it was first established is lacking.

From to , fans were allowed to vote for three of the award&#x27;s ten annual nominees; in the final years of fan voting, it was conducted on the Hall&#x27;s Facebook page. Through , seven candidates were selected by a committee consisting of previous Frick Award winners and broadcast historians and columnists, which also determined the final recipient. Beginning with the award, the final election committee no longer selected any of the finalists; that became the role of a Hall of Fame research committee.

===2014 changes===
Other changes in the selection process were also announced for the 2014 award; these changes were similar to those instituted in 2010 for Veterans Committee balloting. From 2014 to 2016, candidates were considered every third year, based on the era in which they made their most significant contributions:

* &quot;High Tide Era&quot;: Mid-1980s to present, including the rise of regional cable networks. Individuals from this era were considered for the 2014 award.
* &quot;Living Room Era&quot;: Mid-1950s to early 1980s, reflecting the rise of television. Individuals from this era were considered for the 2015 award.
* &quot;Broadcasting Dawn Era&quot;: Origin of broadcasting to early 1950s. Individuals from this era were first considered for the 2016 award.

===2017 changes===
The Hall of Fame announced further changes to the selection process in 2016 that took effect immediately, with the first award affected by these changes being that for 2017. Fan voting was eliminated, and the final ballot was cut from 10 to 8. Candidates were still considered every third year, but in mostly different categories:

* &quot;Current Major League Markets&quot;: Broadcasters who made their mark with one or more specific MLB teams. These individuals were first considered for the 2017 award.
* &quot;National Voices&quot;: Broadcasters who made their contributions with national media. These individuals were first considered for the 2018 award.
* &quot;Broadcasting Beginnings&quot;: Pioneers of baseball broadcasting, roughly covering the time span of the previous &quot;Broadcasting Dawn Era&quot;. These individuals were first considered for the 2019 award.

===2022 changes===
In April 2022, the Hall of Fame announced further changes to the Frick Award selection process. The size of the ballot was restored to 10 nominees, while also requiring that at least one candidate be a foreign-language broadcaster. The election cycle was also revised, effective with the 2023 balloting: four consecutive elections will have a composite ballot of local and national broadcasters, followed by one election for broadcasters whose careers ended prior to 1994 (the introduction of the Wild Card era). Thus, recipients will be selected per the following balloting rotation, which will then repeat: 
* Composite ballot (local and national voices): , 2024, 2025, 2026
* Pre-Wild Card Era ballot: 2027

===Veterans Committee participation===
For several years in the early 2000s, Frick Award honorees also became life members of the Veterans Committee, which considers candidates for Hall of Fame induction who are not eligible for the regular voting by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America – specifically, players no longer on the BBWAA ballot and all non-players. However, starting with the elections, voting for players on the main Veterans Committee ballot was restricted to Hall of Fame members. After further changes announced for the elections, Frick Award winners became eligible to serve on the voting bodies that replaced the Veterans Committee that consider candidates from different eras of baseball.

<text>USS &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; (DD-931) was the lead ship of her class of destroyer of the United States Navy. She was named for Admiral Forrest Sherman USN (1896–1951).

== History ==
&quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath, Maine, on 27 October 1953, launched on 5 February 1955 by Mrs. Forrest P. Sherman, widow of Admiral Sherman, and commissioned on 9 November 1955.

After a year of initial training and fitting out, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; arrived at her home port, Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, 15 January 1957. Two days later she sailed for Washington, D.C., where she was open for public visiting during the week of the second inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. From Newport, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; sailed on training and fleet exercises along the east coast and in the Caribbean, until the summer of 1957, when she took part in the midshipman cruise to South America and the International Naval Review in Hampton Roads on 12 June.

On 3 September 1957, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; sailed for NATO Operation Strikeback, screening a carrier striking group in exercises off Norway. She called at Plymouth, England, and Copenhagen, Denmark, before returning to Narragansett Bay on 22 October. In preparation for her first deployment to the Mediterranean, the destroyer took part in amphibious exercises off Puerto Rico in July 1958, and arrived at Gibraltar on 10 August. She patrolled the eastern Mediterranean through the rest of the month, then sailed to join the 7th Fleet in its operations off Taiwan in support of the threatened islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Sailing eastward to complete a cruise around the world, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; returned to Newport on 11 November.

During the summer of 1959, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; joined in Operation Inland Seas, the cruise of a task force into the Great Lakes in celebration of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. She served as escort to the Royal Yacht HMY &quot;Britannia&quot; with President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II embarked, then sailed on to entertain over 110,000 visitors at Great Lakes ports. Returning to Newport, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; took part in coastal exercises with the Atlantic Fleet, then underwent minor repairs and alterations in the Boston Naval Shipyard.

More training exercises began in 1960 for the destroyer, and on 21 March she sailed on a 7-month cruise to the Mediterranean and duty with the 6th Fleet. En route home in October, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; came to the aid of the Liberian freighter &quot;Allen Christensen&quot; who had a severely injured man on board. Taking off the patient in a motor whaleboat at night, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; sped him to Bermuda, site of the nearest hospital. The destroyer arrived at Newport on 15 October and some four weeks later entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for major overhaul, lasting into 1961.
== Fate ==
&quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; was decommissioned on 5 November 1982, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 July 1990 and sold for scrap to the Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 11 December 1992. When the company went bankrupt she was resold to N. R. Acquisition Incorporated of New York City by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court.

The ship was &#x27;recovered&#x27; by the Navy and berthed in the Inactive Ship Facility at the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was eventually put on a list for donation for museum status. In 2006, Congress passed Pub.L. 109–163, the National Defense Authorization Act 2006, which authorized the transfer of &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; to the USS Forrest Sherman DD-931 Foundation Inc, a group that planned on moving the ship to Indian River Inlet, Delaware to restore it as a museum. These plans fell through and the ship was removed from donation hold in 2011. Volunteers from other museum ships were allowed to remove useful parts/equipment in June 2011.

The Forrest Sherman was finally sold for scrapping 15 December 2014, and was scrapped by the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services.

<doc id="521157" wikidata="Q2469808" url="?curid=521157" title="USS John Paul Jones (DD-932)">
<text>USS &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (DD-932/DDG-32), named for John Paul Jones, was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer of the United States Navy.

&quot;John Paul Jones&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath in Maine on 18 January 1954, launched on 7 May 1955 by Mrs. Carney, wife of Admiral Robert B. Carney and commissioned on 5 April 1956, Comdr. R. W. Hayler, Jr., in command.

==History==
&quot;John Paul Jones&quot;, second of the initial class destroyers of post-war design, conducted exhaustive shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after which she departed for a cruise to Northern Europe and the British Isles. During this voyage Commander Hayler and members of the crew visited the birthplace of John Paul and presented the ship&#x27;s emblem to the people of Kirkcudbright. She returned to her home port, Newport, 8 October 1956.

The new destroyer departed for her first cruise with Sixth Fleet 25 March 1957. In May she took part in an operation in support of King Hussein of Jordan. After successfully averting his overthrow, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; sailed for Newport once more, arriving 6 June 1957. NATO maneuvers in the North Atlantic followed in October. After another brief cruise to the Mediterranean, she arrived in Fall River, Massachusetts, on 27 November, and in January 1958 she took part in fleet exercises in the Caribbean.

In the spring of 1958 &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; operated with Canadian ships on training maneuvers in the Atlantic. After further training off the East Coast and in the Caribbean, she sailed again for the Mediterranean 17 March 1959. This tour with the 6th Fleet on its peace-keeping mission ended 24 July when the ship arrived Boston.

The year 1960 began with 2nd Fleet operations out of Newport, and in June the destroyer embarked midshipmen for a training cruise. She then departed 22 August for a cruise to South America. As part of Operation Unitas, she circumnavigated the continent, visiting many of America&#x27;s southern allies and taking part in joint exercises with their navies. After transiting the Straits of Magellan and the Panama Canal, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; returned to Newport 13 December 1960. During 1961 and 1962 the ship carried out antisubmarine exercises in the Caribbean and out of Newport. In April 1962 she took part in a fleet review and weapons demonstration for President John F. Kennedy, and in July she again embarked midshipmen for training. In October 1962 the ship was on station with the Atlantic Recovery Forces during the orbital flight of Commander Wally Schirra, and soon afterward moved off the coast of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The following year saw the veteran ship embark on another Mediterranean cruise 6 February to 1 July; the remainder of 1963 was spent on antisubmarine exercises in the Atlantic.

Operations along the Atlantic Coast continued until &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; began another 6th Fleet deployment 20 June 1964. She operated primarily in the western Mediterranean, on ASW assignments until returning home 3 September 1964. Early in 1965 she participated in Operation &quot;Spring board&quot; in the Caribbean. In March the destroyer received a Gemini-recovery crane and on the 19th sailed for her recovery station some 200 miles south of Bermuda. She was to pick up astronauts Major Virgil Grissom and Lt. Cmdr. John W. Young and their space craft in the event that they ended their flight after two rather than the three scheduled orbits. However, all went well so she returned to Norfolk 27 March without headlines.

&quot;John Paul Jones&quot; headed back to the Mediterranean 18 June for NATO exercises with units of the French, Greek and British navies.

&quot;John Paul Jones&quot; was converted to a guided missile destroyer at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard between 20 December 1965 and 15 March 1967 and designated DDG-32.

==Fate==
&quot;John Paul Jones&quot; was a member of the U. S. Pacific Fleet when she was decommissioned on 15 December 1982. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 November 1985 and sunk as a target off the coast of California on 31 January 2001.

<doc id="521165" wikidata="Q57655" url="?curid=521165" title="Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum">
<text>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (; born 15 July 1949) is an Emirati politician and royal who is the current ruler of Dubai, and serves as the vice president and prime minister of the UAE. Mohammed succeeded his brother Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum as UAE vice president, UAE prime minister, and ruler of Dubai following the latter&#x27;s death in 2006.

A billionaire, Mohammed generates most of his income from real estate and is described as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most prominent real estate developers&quot;. There is a blurred line between the assets of the Government of Dubai and those of the ruling Al Maktoum family. Land which is owned by him is managed as an asset of the state. He oversaw the growth of Dubai into a global city, as well as the launch of a number of government-owned enterprises including Emirates Airline, DP World, and the Jumeirah Group. Some of these are held by Dubai Holding. Mohammed has overseen the development of certain projects in Dubai, such as the Palm Islands and the Burj Al Arab hotel, as well as Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world as of 2024.

Mohammed is the absolute ruler of Dubai and the prime minister of the UAE, a position appointed by the president. The government is autocratic.

On 5 March 2020, a British court ruled that on the balance of probabilities, Mohammed had abducted two of his daughters, Shamsa and Latifa, and had threatened his former wife, the Jordanian princess Haya bint Hussein. Allegedly, Shamsa and Latifa were forcibly medicated while held in Dubai under Mohammed&#x27;s orders since 2000 and 2018, respectively. On 16 February 2021, BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast a documentary featuring Latifa&#x27;s video messages that she made secretly under enforced detention in Dubai on her father&#x27;s orders.

Mohammed is an equestrian and is the founder of the Maktoum family-owned Godolphin stable and the owner of Darley, a thoroughbred breeding operation, operational in six countries. In 2012, he rode the horse &quot;Madji Du Pont&quot; 160 km to take the FEI World Endurance Championship.

== Early life ==
Sheikh Mohammed is the third of four sons of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai. The Al Maktoum family is Dubai&#x27;s ruling family and descendants of the House of Al-Falasi, of which Mohammed is the tribal leader. His mother was Sheikha Latifa bint Hamdan Al Nahyan, daughter of former ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan. He grew up in a house without electricity. A hundred people or more lived there, including guards and maids.

=== Education ===
From the age of four, Mohammed was privately tutored in Arabic and Islamic Studies. In 1955, he began formal education at Al Ahmedia School. At the age of 10, he moved to Al Shaab School, and two years later, attended Dubai Secondary School. In 1966, with his cousin Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Maktoum, he attended the Bell Educational Trust&#x27;s English Language School in the United Kingdom. He subsequently studied at the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, passing out with the sword of honour as the top Commonwealth student. He also travelled to Italy to train as a pilot.

== Political career ==

=== Dubai Police ===

Upon Mohammed&#x27;s return to Dubai from military training at age 20, his father, Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, appointed him as the head of the Dubai Police Force and the Dubai Defence Force (which later became a part of the Union Defence Force).

=== Minister of Defence ===
In January 1968, Mohammed was present when his father and Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan first met in the desert between Dubai and Abu Dhabi at &quot;Argoub El Sedira&quot; to agree to the formation of a union of emirates following British notification of intent to withdraw from the Trucial States. When the new country of the United Arab Emirates was founded on 2 December 1971, Mohammed became its first minister of defence at the age of 22.

A period of uncertainty and instability followed the Union of the United Arab Emirates, including skirmishes between tribes over property, straddling new borders. On 24 January 1972, the exiled former ruler of the Emirate of Sharjah, Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi, led an insurrectionist coup against his successor, Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi. Following a spirited firefight between the Union Defence Force and Sheikh Saqr&#x27;s forces – mostly Egyptian mercenaries who had entered the UAE through Ras Al Khaimah – Mohammed accepted Saqr&#x27;s surrender. Sheikh Khalid had been killed in the action, leading to the accession of his brother Sultan as ruler of Sharjah. Mohammed delivered Saqr to UAE president Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who put Saqr under house arrest in Al Ain.

In 1973, Mohammed was involved in protracted negotiations with the hijackers of JAL 404, led by Japanese Red Army member Osamu Maruouka, which landed in Dubai after being hijacked as it departed Schiphol Airport. Although unsuccessful in obtaining the release of the hostages (they were finally freed, and the 747 blown up, in Libya), he was more successful in a later negotiation with the three hijackers of KLM 861, who released the balance of their hostages and handed over the plane in return for safe passage. In 1977, Mohammed oversaw the integration of Dubai&#x27;s military forces with those of the other emirates.

=== Crown Prince of Dubai ===
On 3 January 1995, Mohammed&#x27;s brother Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai, signed two decrees. One decree appointed Mohammed as crown prince and the other appointed their brother Hamdan as the deputy ruler of Dubai.

Mohammed created the Dubai Shopping Festival in late 1995, an annual event that has become a significant contributor to the economy of the UAE.

In 2001, Mohammed ordered the arrest of Obaid Saqr bin-Busit, the head of Dubai Customs and the chairman of the World Customs Association.

=== Ruler of Dubai, Vice President and Prime Minister ===
After roughly a decade of de facto rule, Mohammed became the ruler of Dubai on 4 January 2006, upon the death of his brother Maktoum. The following day, the Federal National Council selected him as the new vice president of the UAE. On 11 February, the Council approved President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan&#x27;s nomination of Sheikh Mohammed for prime minister.

Mohammed is the absolute monarch of Dubai. The government is described as autocratic, as there are no democratic institutions, and internal dissent is prohibited. Scholars characterize the UAE as authoritarian. According to human rights organizations, there are systematic human rights violations, including the torture and forced disappearance of government critics. There is a blurred line between the assets of the state of Dubai and those of the Al Maktoum ruling family.

Mohammed issued a law in 2006 to form the Dubai Establishment for Women Development, renamed by law in 2009 as the Dubai Women Establishment. He also formed the UAE Gender Balance Council in 2015.

On 19 October 2020, Mohammed led the UAE Council of Ministers meeting that ratified a peace agreement with Israel, normalizing diplomatic relationships between the countries. The Council, again headed by Mohammed, approved the decision to found an Emirati embassy in Tel Aviv in January, and Mohammed swore in the first Emirati ambassador to Israel, Mahmoud Al Khajah, a month later.

==== Space exploration ====
Mohammed founded the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre in 2015, which announced it would be launching a spacecraft to Mars to study the planet’s atmosphere; He stated that the planet was chosen for its &quot;epic challenge,&quot; saying it would benefit the Emirati economy. He announced that the mission would be called Hope after a public vote, as the name would &quot;send a message of optimism to millions of young Arabs,&quot; since &quot;Arab civilisation once played a great role in contributing to human knowledge, and [would] play that role again.&quot;

Mohammed announced that the Hope mission had succeeded at orbit insertion on 9 February 2021, and shared the first picture the probe had captured days later. Hope became the first Arab mission to space, as well as the first of three missions in July 2020—the others from the United States and China–to arrive at Mars.

In 2020, Mohammed announced a second mission, this one to the moon. The Emirates Lunar Mission used a lunar rover named Rashid, reportedly built entirely in the UAE. It was launched on 11 December 2022 on a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket. In a historic first, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s book titled &quot;The Journey From the Desert to the Stars&quot; was launched from the International Space Station (ISS) through Emirati astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi.

== Business career ==

Mohammed has overseen the creation and growth of a number of businesses and economic assets of Dubai, with a number held by two companies under his ownership, Dubai World and Dubai Holding. According to the laws of Dubai, the ruling family owns all undeveloped land in Dubai, which has allowed the family to prosper from real estate development. During Mohammed&#x27;s rule, Dubai has seen enormous population growth, causing a real estate boom in Dubai. The boom was in part facilitated by Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s 2002 decree that foreigners would be allowed to purchase property in Dubai.

Mohammed established Dubai World by decree, leading to the company&#x27;s launch on 2 July 2006, as a holding company consolidating a number of assets including logistics company, DP World, property developer Nakheel Properties, and investment company Istithmar World. With more than 50,000 employees in over 100 cities around the globe, the Group has real estate, logistics and other business investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. The company is owned by the government of Dubai.

Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s personal corporate portfolio is the Dubai Holding Group, which is involved in a variety of investments. Dubai Holding benefits from its association with the ruling family of Dubai, and is given free land by the Dubai government.

Mohammed was responsible for the launch of Emirates Airline.
=== Launch of Emirates Airline ===
Through the 1970s, as well as his role as head of Dubai Defence Force and UAE Minister of Defence, Mohammed oversaw Dubai&#x27;s energy resources and was in charge of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority. It was in this latter role, in March 1985, that he founded Emirates Airline, tasking then-head of Dnata, Maurice Flanagan, with launching a new airline to be called Emirates after a dispute with Gulf Air over Dubai&#x27;s &#x27;Open Skies&#x27; policy. The launch budget of the airline was $10 million (the amount Flanagan said he needed to launch an airline) and its inaugural flight took place on 25 October 1985. Sheikh Mohammed appointed his uncle Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum as chairman of the new company. A further $75 million in facilities and materials was provided, but Emirates has always maintained that it has received no further subsidies throughout the company&#x27;s meteoric growth to become one of the world&#x27;s leading airlines.

In 1989, Mohammed inaugurated the first Dubai Airshow. In 2013, the exhibition had grown to over 1,000 exhibiting companies, and was the venue for Emirates&#x27; placement of the largest aeroplane order in history, with $99 billion combined orders with Airbus for its A380 and Boeing for its 777X.

=== Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah ===

The Burj Al Arab was inaugurated in December 1999. The hotel, constructed from a design by WS Atkins in response to a brief from Mohammed to create &quot;a truly iconic&quot; building, styles itself as &quot;the world&#x27;s most luxurious hotel&quot;. It was constructed on an island offshore from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, the first property managed by Jumeirah, the hotel management company launched by Mohammed in 1997 and headed by ex-Trust House Forte executive Gerald Lawless. While work began on both hotels at the same time, the island to house the Burj Al Arab required three years to build before construction began above ground. Jumeirah&#x27;s international expansion, driven after it became part of Dubai Holding in 2004, encompasses 22 hotels in ten countries.

=== Dubai Internet City and TECOM ===
On 29 October 1999, Mohammed announced Dubai Internet City, a technology hub and free trade zone. Offering companies long leases, full ownership, and fast access to government services, DIC grew from its first tenants in October 2000, to a current zone employing about 15,000 people. In November 2000, it was joined by Dubai Media City, a content and media production-free zone, which is co-located with DIC. The launch of DIC came with assurances from Mohammed regarding media freedoms. In 2007, he issued a decree banning the imprisonment of journalists following an incident in which local journalists were accused of libel and sentenced to jail terms.

=== Palm Islands ===

The Palm Islands were developed by Nakheel Properties, which Mohammed founded.

==Interests, activities and philanthropic work==
=== Mohammed bin Rashid Global initiatives (MBRGI) ===
The Mohammed bin Rashid Global Initiatives is a charitable foundation which consolidates the work of some 33 charitable foundations, entities and initiatives which, together, implement more than 1,400 development programs, including the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Centre for Cultural Understanding (SMCCU).

=== Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government ===
The Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government (previously the Dubai School of Government) is an academic and research institution in the area of public policy and administration.

=== Aid to Palestine ===
Mohammed made a grant of 600 houses to Gaza following the 2008–2009 Gaza war.

=== Aiding mosque construction in the Netherlands ===
In 2000, Mohammed donated €4 million for the construction of the Essalaam Mosque in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

In June 2017, two new initiatives were added to the Mohammed Bin Rashid Global Initiatives, within the &quot;Empowering Communities&quot; sector, namely the International Institute for Tolerance and the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Award for Tolerance. In this respect, Sheikh Mohammed issued Law No. (9) of 2017 on the Establishment of the International Institute for Tolerance and Decree No. (23) of 2017 on the Formation of a Board of Trustees and Decree No. (28) of 2017 on the Appointment of a Managing Director for the International Institute for Tolerance. In this respect, Law No. (9) of 2017 includes the launch of the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Award for Tolerance, administered in accordance with the provisions and statute of said Law. Hence, the establishment of the International Institute for Tolerance aims at instilling a spirit of tolerance across the community, building a cohesive society, strengthening the UAE&#x27;s standing and position as a model of tolerance, as well as renouncing extremism and all forms of discrimination among people on the basis of religion, sex, race, color or language, in addition to honoring all entities and institutions contributing to the promotion of tolerance and open, interfaith dialogue.

=== Sporting interests ===
Mohammed is a major figure in international thoroughbred horse racing and breeding. He owns Darley Stud, the biggest horse breeding operation in the world with farms in the United States, Ireland, England, and Australia. In 1985 he bought the Irish thoroughbred Park Appeal for an undisclosed sum at the end of her second season. She went on to produce at least nine winners from twelve foals and is the ancestor of many successful horses.

Mohammed had raced horses as a child (he would share his breakfast with his horse on the way to school) but he attended his first formal race at Newmarket in 1967 with his brother Hamdan, watching Royal Palace win the 2,000 guineas. Becoming an owner in his own right, ten years later he won his first race with Hatta at Brighton. And five years after that, Mohammed and Hamdan had three studs and 100 horses under training.
In late 1981, Mohammed purchased Gainsborough Stud at Woolton Hill, near Newbury, Berkshire, United Kingdom. He owns Ballysheehan Stud in County Tipperary, Ireland; as well as Gainsborough Farm Inc. in Versailles, Kentucky, United States. His racing operations include the ownership of Darley Stables and he is the leading partner in his family&#x27;s Godolphin Stables. Mohammed hosts the Dubai World Cup at Meydan Racecourse.

By 1992, Mohammed had started &#x27;wintering&#x27; his horses in Dubai, frequently against the advice of trainers and pundits in the UK. The results were a string of high-profile wins, and by 1994 he founded Godolphin. In 1995, his hands-on approach to racing resulted in a major split with leading trainer Henry Cecil after a disagreement over racing a horse Mohammed insisted was injured. Cecil took the argument public and Mohammed removed all his horses from Cecil&#x27;s stable.

Godolphin&#x27;s first win, Balanchine taking the Oaks at Epsom Downs, England, in 1994, was to mark the beginning of a winning streak with horses such as Lammtarra, Daylami, Fantastic Light, Street Cry, Sulamani, Dubawi, and Ramonti among them. Dubai Millennium, said to be Mohammed&#x27;s favourite, won nine of his ten starts before succumbing to injury followed by grass sickness in 2001.

In 1996, the Dubai World Cup was inaugurated as the world&#x27;s richest horserace, drawing the legendary American dirt track horse Cigar to race in Dubai. Today, held at the Meydan Racecourse, the race meeting carries a prize of $27 million.

In the UK, Mohammed&#x27;s horses have won Group One races including several of the British Classic Races. His horses have also won the Irish Derby Stakes, the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe and, the 2006 Preakness Stakes with Bernardini in the US. In 2008, he bought the Woodlands Stud empire for more than $460 million. The same year, he nearly bought out Charlton Athletic but he later turned down.
At the age of 63, Mohammed won the 2012 World Endurance Championship over a 160 km course. Both his thoroughbreds and endurance horses have failed drug tests – although his trainers (including Mahmood Al Zarooni) have accepted the blame. His endurance racing stable has also been involved in other scandals, including both fatal injuries, and ringers. In 2015, the FEI suspended the United Arab Emirates following a series of scandals.

In the 15th Asian Games in 2006, the sheikh&#x27;s eldest son, Rashid bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, took the individual gold in endurance riding. Mohammed&#x27;s sons Rashid, Ahmed, Majid, and Hamdan took the team gold in endurance riding, his niece Latifa took a bronze in show jumping, and his daughter Maitha led the UAE team in taekwondo. In 2013, when the UAE national football team won the Gulf Cup, Mohammed gave the team 50 million dirhams ($13.7 million). His wife awarded the team a further 25 million dirhams ($6.8 million), while their grandsons contributed 12 million dirhams ($3.3 million).

Godolphin&#x27;s Cross Counter, ridden by Kerrin McEvoy and trained by Charlie Appleby won the 2018 Melbourne Cup.

== Controversies ==
=== Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa kidnapping allegations ===
:&quot; Mohammed has three daughters named Latifa. The other two daughters are not connected to this allegation. &quot;
An early 2000s British police investigation of allegations, made by a former riding instructor about the attempted escape of Mohammed&#x27;s daughter Latifa (born 1985) from her family estate in England and the subsequent kidnapping on a street in Cambridge of Latifa&#x27;s sister Shamsa in 2001, was inconclusive. He has been indicted due to the mistreatment Sheikh Laitfa Al Maktoum since then.
On 11 March 2018, a video was released of Sheikha Latifa after her failed attempt to flee the UAE and subsequent disappearance, in which she claimed she was fleeing from her family, made allegations of abuse, and said her father was responsible for a number of murders, including the murder of his deceased older brother&#x27;s wife. The escape attempt was the focus of a documentary by Australian broadcaster Nine News as well as BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigation.

In December 2018, former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, after meeting Latifa in the presence of other family members, said that Latifa was now in the care of her family. Her statement was criticised by human rights groups, who said that Robinson would not have been able to tell in the meeting whether Latifa truly had psychological issues. A spokeswoman for &quot;The Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice&quot; confirmed that Robinson was approached by Latifa&#x27;s stepmother Princess Haya bint Hussein, an old friend of Robinson&#x27;s, and was requested to go to Dubai by Princess Haya and that Haya paid the fare, less than two weeks after the BBC ran a documentary detailing Latifa&#x27;s failed escape attempt in March. Robinson admits she was &quot;horribly tricked&quot; when photographs of the private lunch were made public and that both she and Haya had been told of details of Latifa&#x27;s bipolar disorder, a condition which she does not have. Latifa&#x27;s cousin Marcus Essabri reported that Latifa&#x27;s photos with Mary Robinson seem to show Latifa medicated while held in Dubai under her father&#x27;s orders.

In February 2021, video footage obtained by the BBC showed Latifa saying she has been &quot;a hostage&quot; for over a year &quot;with no access to medical help&quot; in &quot;solitary confinement&quot; without access to medical or legal help in a &quot;villa jail&quot; with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police. The governments of Dubai and the UAE have not responded to requests for comment from the BBC. Despite her family&#x27;s insistence that she has been enjoying time with them at home the past two years, Latifa says in the series of videos released by her advocates that she is &quot;a hostage&quot; and fears for her life. &quot;Every day, I&#x27;m worried about my safety in my life. I don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;m going to survive this situation. The police threaten me that they would take me outside and shoot me if I didn&#x27;t cooperate with them,&quot; she said. &quot;They also threatened me that I would be in prison my whole life and I&#x27;ll never see the sun again.&quot;

In 2021, investigative reporting into the Pegasus spyware found that Latifa&#x27;s name was added to a list of names that were potential targets of the spyware just days before she was seized by commandos of an unknown country, off the coast of India, while she was aboard a yacht in an attempt to flee Dubai. A brief statement issued on Latifa&#x27;s behalf by law firm Taylor Wessing stated that she was free to travel and requested privacy. In the same year the #FreeLatifa campaign ended after Latifa had been photographed in public places such as Dubai, Spain and Iceland.

In February 2022, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, stated that she met Latifa in Paris and that Latifa was well and wished for respect for her privacy.

=== Princess Haya escape ===
In June 2019, Princess Haya fled Dubai along with her two children, a son and a daughter, and was in Germany seeking political asylum. A subsequent poem composed by Mohammed (an occasional couplet-writer) and posted on Instagram alluded to betrayal in love.

Haya moved from Germany to the United Kingdom, filed for sole custody of their two children, a forced marriage protection order (FMPO), and a non-molestation order at the High Court of Justice in London in July 2019.

In December 2019, a UK family court ruled that, on the balance of probabilities, Mohammed may have committed the crime of &quot;taunting&quot; Haya after her adulterous affair with a bodyguard became known, which verbal &quot;taunting,&quot; the court held, amounted to subjecting Haya to &quot;a campaign of intimidation,&quot; reportedly including guns placed on her pillow. The findings were published in March 2021. In October 2021, the High Court ruled that Mohammed&#x27;s agents used the Israeli Pegasus spyware to hack the phones of Princess Haya, her solicitors, a personal assistant and two members of her security team in the summer of 2020. The court ruled that the agents acted &quot;with the express or implied authority&quot; of the sheikh; he denied knowledge of the hacking. The judgment referred to the hacking as &quot;serial breaches of (UK) domestic criminal law&quot;, &quot;in violation of fundamental common law and ECHR rights&quot;, &quot;interference with the process of this court and the mother&#x27;s access to justice&quot; and &quot;abuse of power&quot; by a head of state.

In December 2021, Haya was granted full custody of her children, and alimony and support in the amount of US$720 million. In 2022, the court ordered that there should be no direct contact between Mohammed and his children, and no input by him into decision-making about their lives.

=== Child camel jockeys ===
In September 2006, Mohammed was accused of encouraging the abduction and enslavement of thousands of boys for use as jockeys in camel races. A class-action suit was filed against him in the US state of Florida. In 2006, American lawyers representing the UAE raised a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that none of the involved parties resided in the US, arguing that the UN program best served the interests of the children. In July 2007, Judge Cecilia Altonaga accepted the motion and dismissed the suit.

A 2006 UNICEF-sponsored program with the UAE government resulted in the repatriation of hundreds of children formerly enslaved as camel jockeys, and provided them with social services and compensation upon return to their home countries of Pakistan, Sudan, Mauritania, and Bangladesh. The UAE government set aside US$2.7 million in initial funding in 2005 with an additional $9 million for the second phase, and to enforce compliance, adopted a law officially banning the practice with penalties of jail time and a $27,200 fine. UNICEF endorsed the UAE&#x27;s efforts and expressed the hopes that &quot;the UAE&#x27;s programme will serve as a model to other countries in the region, as a means of ending all forms of exploitation of children&quot;.

=== Horse racing drugs scandal ===
In April 2013, Mohammed&#x27;s Godolphin stables trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni was disqualified for eight years from thoroughbred horse racing by the British Horseracing Authority for administering steroids to eleven racehorses. Mohammed stated that he was &quot;appalled and angered&quot; by the case and announced that the stable would be locked down while drug tests were carried out on all horses under Al Zarooni&#x27;s care. In May, Mohammed, as prime minister of the UAE, issued a decree outlawing and criminalizing the use of anabolic steroids on horses in the UAE.

In October 2013, Mohammed faced another scandal in the venue of horseracing, with reports of potentially toxic and dangerous steroids, anaesthetics, and anti-inflammatory drugs being shipped into the UAE, mislabeled as &quot;horse tack&quot;. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; commented that a &quot;PR campaign is already underway, with Sheikh Mohammed again cast as a victim of employee malpractice&quot;.

=== Pandora Papers ===
In October 2021, an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) revealed that over 330 prominent politicians and public officials across the world had ties with offshore companies. Amongst them were 35 current and former world leaders. The leaked 11.9 million files revealed that Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum also used offshore companies to manage and expand his wealth. In order to carry out his dealings, he registered three companies in the tax havens of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and the Bahamas. Registered by an Emirati firm, Axiom Limited, the three companies were Tandem Investco Limited and Tandem DirectorCo Limited in BVI and Allied International Investments Limited in the Bahamas. Partly owned by the Dubai Holding, in which Mohammed owns major shares, Axiom Limited used the three companies to “expand its core business”.

== Personal life ==
Sheikh Mohammed has 26 children from several wives.

One of Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s ex-wives is Princess Haya bint Hussein, daughter of former King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan. In 2022, the High Court of England and Wales ruled and mandated that Sheikh Mohammed must not have direct contact with his children by Princess Haya, or input into decision-making about them, because of his coercive and abusive behaviour which &quot;had emotionally and psychologically harmed their children&quot;.

On 19 September 2022, he attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey, London.

In addition to Arabic, he also speaks English.

=== Wealth and assets ===
In 2021, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project estimated that Sheikh Mohammed owned assets worth $14 billion.

Sheikh Mohammed owns the yacht named &quot;Dubai&quot;, built by the German company Blohm + Voss and designed by English designer Andrew Winch, who owns Winch Design. The yacht is long, and was the world&#x27;s third largest yacht as of 2014, with the capacity for up to 115 people including crew. Another of his yachts is the &quot;Alloya&quot;, built by Sanlorenzo in 2013.

Sheikh Mohammed owns real estate in the United Kingdom worth more than 100 million British pounds, as well as properties in Rome through a company registered in Luxembourg. According to a 2021 analysis by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Transparency International, Sheikh Mohammed is one of the largest landowners in the UK, owning more than 100,000 acres. The exact number of properties is not known, as most of the properties connected to him are owned through offshore companies in the tax havens of Guernsey and Jersey. When asked about these holdings, Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s lawyer rejected that the properties were bought through offshore companies or that the holdings were intended to avoid UK taxes.

In the 2021 Pandora Papers leaks, it was revealed that Sheikh Mohammed was a shareholder in three additional companies registered in jurisdictions allowing secrecy.

<doc id="521166" wikidata="Q382105" url="?curid=521166" title="1 gauge">
<text>1 gauge, gauge 1 or gauge one is a model railway and toy train standard that was popular in the early 20th century, particularly with European manufacturers. Its track measures , making it larger than 0 gauge but slightly smaller than wide gauge, which came to be the dominant U.S. standard during the 1920s.

Gauge one was standardised, according to &quot;Model Railways and Locomotive&quot; magazine of August 1909, at . An exact 1:32 scale would yield for standard gauge prototype. The distance between the wheel tyres was set at and between the centre of the track 48 mm (no inch equivalent suggesting it was metric users&#x27; requirement only). The wheel width was set at .

Definitions using gauge, rather than scale, were more common in the early days with the four gauges for which standards were adopted being No. 0 (commonly called O gauge currently), No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3.

==Popularity==
Initially as popular in the United States as in the UK, 1 gauge lost popularity in the U.S. due to World War I, which dramatically decreased foreign imports, allowing the U.S. wide gauge standard to gain traction. After World War I, most surviving U.S. manufacturers switched to wide gauge. In the UK and the rest of the world, 1 gauge also declined, although more slowly, and by the 1940s had practically disappeared.

In the 1950s and 1960s 1 gauge experienced a renaissance, first in the UK and then elsewhere. This was helped by 1 gauge being the same size as the modern G scale, a popular standard for outdoor model railways.

==Scale==
Although vintage 1 gauge trains use the same track standard as modern G scale, scale modeling was not a primary design consideration in 1 gauge&#x27;s heyday, so the actual size and scale of the locomotives and cars (UK, wagons) varied. Generally, 1 gauge equipment works out to approximately 1:32 scale (roughly 10 mm = 1 foot). G scale at 1:22.5 means the 1 gauge track represents track. Such railways are to be found in, among other places, Switzerland, the inspiration source for many commercial G gauge models.

==Live steam==
Due to the size of the locomotives it is possible for them to be powered with live steam, which to many is a large advantage as they are cheaper than traditional live steam garden railways. These are usually fired by gas or methylated spirit, which are both very popular. Another form, which is becoming popular, is coal, which gives the user the smell that only steam locomotives carry.

==Manufacturers==
Accucraft Trains in California, The Gauge One Model Railway Company in Britain, and Aster Hobbies Ltd in Japan produce gauge 1 items, mostly coal, methylated spirits, and butane fired.

Wrightway Rolling Stock produce a range of quality coaches for British outline gauge one railways and a range of cars for North American and European outline railways. They can supply from their range or custom build. Some of the range is available in 10 mm scale.

Märklin, in Germany, has produced several different lines of trains that can be considered 1 gauge. Their first production took place in the late 1800s, with a line of &quot;tinplate&quot; type trains. This line was discontinued in favour of their more popular 0 gauge trains. In the late 1960s, Märklin re-entered the large scale market with a modest range of 1 gauge trains. Based upon one drive mechanism made of metal, Märklin produced both a German Class 80 0-6-0T steam locomotive in two different liveries and a 0-Co-0 diesel based upon a Henschel design. This early range included two-axle passenger cars, two-axle box cars and tank cars, all made of plastic. The tank cars could hold liquids and the box car and passenger car had operating doors. This range continued in production for a number of years, but was gradually replaced with more accurate locomotives and larger cars. The range expanded to include a Class 38 4-6-0, a Class 78 4-6-4T and a Class 212 Bo-Bo diesel. In the late 1980s the Märklin 1 gauge line included a large number of freight car designs in different liveries and a range of three axle passenger cars. The earlier passenger cars and box cars were retained, while the tank cars were discontinued.

In the early 2000s, Märklin added a second line of gauge one trains under the brand name &quot;Maxi&quot;. These trains were made of stamped metal and were more toylike in appearance in comparison to their scale version of 1 gauge trains. The Maxi line was intended to compete against the more popular LGB product line, which also operates on 45 mm gauged track, but is scaled to IIm standards. As the Maxi line matured, the toylike shiny appearance gradually gave way to matte finishes. This was in response to European market requests, while the toylike appearance was considered to be more popular in the North American market. In later years, the Maxi product line was gradually folded into the conventional Märklin 1 gauge product line, with the mark &quot;Maxi&quot; disappearing around 2008. One of the last locomotives marketed under the &quot;Maxi&quot; brand was a Class V60, which had a stamped metal frame and cast metal superstructure. This locomotive is considered to be the end of the Maxi line. The 1 gauge product line continues in production, super-detailed and more expensive than the Maxi line.

There are many producers of gauge one items in the U.S. and the UK; see the gauge one model railway association website listed below under &quot;External links&quot;.

==In popular culture==
This is the scale and gauge that was used for the model locomotives and rolling stock in series 1 to 12 of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; before switching to CGI animation.

<doc id="521170" wikidata="Q1439571" url="?curid=521170" title="USS Barry (DD-933)">
<text>USS &quot;Barry&quot; (DD-933) was one of eighteen s of the United States Navy, and was the third US destroyer to be named for Commodore John Barry. Commissioned in 1954, she spent most of her career in the Caribbean, Atlantic, and Mediterranean, but also served in the Vietnam War, for which she earned two battle stars. Another notable aspect of her service was the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Decommissioned in 1982, she became the &quot;Display Ship &quot;Barry&quot;&quot; (DS &quot;Barry&quot;), a museum ship at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., in 1984.

Renovation of DS &quot;Barry&quot; to allow her to continue as a museum ship was deemed too expensive to justify. Furthermore, the planned construction of a fixed-span bridge to replace the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, a swing bridge, would have trapped her at the Washington Navy Yard permanently. Scrapping was therefore the only realistic option. An official departure ceremony for the ship took place on 17 October 2015, and she was towed away on 7 May 2016 to be scrapped in Philadelphia. Scrapping was completed by 11 February 2022.

== Construction and commissioning ==
&quot;Barry&quot; was laid down on 15 March 1954 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works Corporation; launched on 1 October 1955; sponsored by Mrs. Francis Rogers, a great-grandniece of Commodore Barry; and commissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard, Charlestown, Massachusetts, on 7 September 1956; Commander Isaac C. Kidd, Jr., in command.

== 1956–1959 ==
&quot;Barry&quot; fitted out at the Boston Naval Shipyard through November, testing her new electronics, ASW gear, and gunnery systems into December. After a brief underway period in Narragansett Bay, she departed 3 January 1957 for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to continue her shakedown. Her training exercises were interspersed with port visits to Kingston, Jamaica; Culebra, Puerto Rico, and Santa Marta, Colombia, before she departed for Colón, Panama.
The destroyer transited the Canal Zone on 26 February and anchored at Salinas, Ecuador, two days later to begin the first of three &quot;goodwill&quot; visits to Latin American ports. After a five-day visit, she departed for Callao, Peru. Arriving 5 March, she hosted the United States Ambassador to Peru, the Honorable Theodore C. Achilles, and the Prefect of Callao, before sailing for Valparaíso, Chile, on 9 March. Three days later, Barry&#x27;s Captain received official calls from the Chilean provincial governor, the Commander in Chief of the Chilean Navy, Vice Almirante Francisco O&#x27;Ryan; the American consul to Valparaíso, and the American Commandant, First Naval Zone; all on the same afternoon. After refueling operations, she cleared Valparaíso on 17 March and shaped course for Panama. Transiting the Canal Zone on 23 March, where she damaged a ship&#x27;s-boat boom in Gatun Locks, she reached Boston on 29 March with her shakedown completed.

The destroyer underwent post-shakedown alterations and repairs at the Boston Naval Shipyard. She cleared the harbor on 15 May for a schedule of local operations off New England. On 27 June &quot;Barry&quot; departed for Rosslare, Ireland, and her first deployment to Europe. She visited St. Nazaire, France, and Lisbon, Portugal, before arriving at Gibraltar on the morning of 16 July. Assigned to the 6th Fleet, the destroyer escorted carriers, operated as plane guard, and conducted ASW barrier patrols before returning to Newport, Rhode Island, in August.

On 24 September, after several weeks of post-deployment repairs and upkeep, she steamed into Narragansett Bay to assist the Norwegian freighter &quot;Belleville&quot; which lay aground off Seal Rock. On 26 September, she helped escort the nuclear submarine , carrying President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as she conducted a diving demonstration off Newport. After several months of routine operations, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and plane guard operations with the carriers and , the destroyer spent May 1958, preparing for her next deployment to the Mediterranean.

Underway 6 June, she transited the Straits of Gibraltar and reached Rhodes on the morning of 20 June. For the next three weeks, &quot;Barry&quot; operated with the 6th Fleet, conducted standard ASW exercises until 14 July, when a coup, organized by young military officers, seized Baghdad and declared a republic in Iraq. The Lebanese government, led by a Christian president, Camille Chamoun, feared a similar revolution might grow out of a Pan-Arab insurgency active in the Bekaa, Tripoli, and Beirut. President Camille Chamoun, following a pro-western policy, immediately requested that the United States land troops to stabilize the situation between Christians, Muslims, and Druze. President Eisenhower honored the request and, fearing the spread of Egyptian and Syrian influence, ordered Marines to Lebanon that same day.

&quot;Barry&quot; moored at Salonika, Greece, got underway the next morning, 15 July, to operate with as her Task Group stood watch over the eastern Mediterranean. She remained in the region, patrolling the Lebanese coast and escorting carriers to support the Marines ashore. After upkeep alongside at İzmir, Turkey, and fleet operations in Augusta Bay, Sicily, she sailed for home 17 September. Entering Boston Naval Shipyard 14 October, &quot;Barry&quot; received, after extensive alternations to her forefoot, the new bow-mounted SQS-23 sonar. Emerging from the yard 17 March, she spent the remainder of the year working up the sonar gear and carrying out tactical trials out of NS Newport and Key West. After a brief yard period at Boston in December, the destroyer conducted routine East Coast operations through May 1960.

== 1960–1962 ==
She cleared Newport on 6 June for a summer goodwill tour and sonar demonstration cruise to Northern Europe. Before the end of June, &quot;Barry&quot; visited Portsmouth, England, and Kiel, Germany, to conduct naval reviews and in-port sonar demonstrations. During July, when she visited the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium, the destroyer&#x27;s crew found the regional navies were eager to discuss technological and security concerns. Furthermore, as &quot;Barry&quot; conducted four at-sea sonar demonstrations with friendly submarines, foreign naval officers were impressed with U.S. naval technology. In August, after exercises with French and Portuguese diesel submarines, the destroyer returned to Newport on 31 August.

After local operations and a port visit to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, &quot;Barry&quot; set out for the Virginia Capes operation areas on 9 January 1961, for hunter-killer ASW exercises. After a brief drydock period at Boston, she ranged the eastern seaboard, conducting tactical tests on her bow sonar and participating in amphibious exercises, from Guantanamo Bay to Halifax, Nova Scotia. After another long yard period at the Boston Naval Shipyard, she departed for the Mediterranean with a task group formed around in June 1962. The destroyer operated with the 6th Fleet for the next two months, watching a steady flow of Soviet merchant ships sail out of the Black Sea towards Cuba before returning to Newport in August for post-deployment upkeep.

== Cuban Missile Crisis ==

On 16 October, the day President John F. Kennedy was shown aerial reconnaissance photographs of Soviet nuclear missiles and launch sites under construction in Cuba, &quot;Barry&quot; was still undergoing upkeep at Newport. On 22 October, when President Kennedy told the nation that he had initiated &quot;as strict quarantine of all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba&quot;, she cleared Newport on the night of 22 October, in company with , and . After rendezvous with on the 26th, she operated as a screening vessel and plane guard. Two days later, she was detached to operate on ASW surveillance and, after taking over the task from and , kept a close watch on contact &quot;C-19&quot;, a surfaced Soviet submarine. &quot;Barry&quot;, at this time well east of the &quot;Quarantine&quot; line, kept the Foxtrot-class diesel boat under surveillance until it submerged at 1814 that evening.

&quot;Barry&quot; remained on the line, carrying out patrols, until 8 November when, during refueling operations with &quot;Essex&quot;, the destroyer had embarked, via highline transfer, a three-person photographic and interpreter party. &quot;Barry&quot;, ordered to investigate a Soviet merchantman, proceeded to her station on the 9th and sighted the merchant ship that evening. She closed to within 400 yards (370 m) on the merchantman&#x27;s starboard quarter, illuminated the ship&#x27;s quarter and bow, and identified her as the Soviet-registry &quot;Metallurg Anosov&quot;. Trailing astern, &quot;Barry&quot; followed the merchant ship, heading east away from the quarantine zone until morning. After dawn, the destroyer closed the merchant to &quot;obtain photographs of deck cargo&quot; until late morning when she shaped course for &quot;Essex&quot; to refuel and transfer photographic personnel.

== 1962–1965 ==

With her part in the &quot;Cuban Quarantine&quot; completed, &quot;Barry&quot; reached Narragansett Bay on 15 November for upkeep. She put out to sea for exercises with Essex on 30 November, ranging as far as Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic and San Juan, Puerto Rico, before returning to Newport on 21 December. For the next six months, &quot;Barry&quot; carried out type-training and ASW exercises before entering the Boston Naval Shipyard in June 1963 for a scheduled interim overhaul period. Later that summer &quot;Barry&quot;, with midshipmen embarked for at-sea training, cruised the eastern seaboard of the United States. While the midshipmen enjoyed the ports of call, including New York and Halifax, Nova Scotia, they also had to ride out a hurricane off Bermuda.

The year 1964 saw &quot;Barry&quot; following a similar routine of exercises. On 27 March, while bound to Puerto Rico, the destroyer received a distress call; a serious fire had broken out in the forward hold, from the stores issues ship . &quot;Barry&quot;&#x27;s fire and rescue party, the first assistance to arrive, helped extinguish the blaze after an 18-hour battle. A short deployment followed, during which Barry participated in a joint NATO exercise with three German destroyers along the Atlantic coast.

In later July, after lost steering control during a highline transfer and damaged &quot;Barry&quot;, the destroyer spent a week in Boston Naval Shipyard. Administrative and operational preparations followed and, on 7 September 1964, &quot;Barry&quot; sailed for a three-and-a-half-month deployment in European and Mediterranean waters. After initial NATO exercises in the Norwegian Sea, during which &quot;Barry&quot; crossed the Arctic Circle on 21 September, she sailed south for antisubmarine screening with the 6th Fleet. Visits to Valencia and Barcelona, Spain; Palma, Majorca; Marseilles and Toulon, France; and Naples, Italy, provided diversion for the ship&#x27;s company between U.S. and NATO operations &quot;Teamwork&quot;, &quot;Masterstroke&quot;, and &quot;Steel Pike I&quot;. She returned to Newport on 18 December.

In February 1965, &quot;Barry&quot; ventured south to the Caribbean for the annual spring training exercises. In June, she acted as an assistant recovery ship for the Gemini 4 space shot. The balance of the summer, highlighted by her winning the Squadron Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for ASW, was spent preparing for the destroyer&#x27;s first Western Pacific deployment. As the flagship of Destroyer Squadron 24 (DesRon 24), the first group of Atlantic Fleet destroyers to deploy to Vietnam, she departed Newport with , &quot;Charles S. Sperry&quot; (DD-697), , , and on 29 September. The Norfolk-based and &quot;Bache&quot; accompanied the squadron.

== Vietnam War ==
Passing through the Panama Canal on 6 October, &quot;Barry&quot; touched at Hawaii, for a short liberty, and Midway before crossing the International Date Line the night of 25 October. At 0100, the &quot;calendar was advanced to the 27th and 26 October was lost forever&quot;. After visiting the Japanese ports of Yokosuka and Sasebo, she reached Subic Bay, in the Philippines, on 17 November, and commenced type training at the Tabones Naval Gunfire Support Range. &quot;Barry&quot; cleared Subic Bay on 30 November in company with Task Group 77.7, including , , and &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; for the South China Sea.

Arriving on station at &quot;Point Dixie&quot;, off the coast of South Vietnam, &quot;Barry&quot; screened the nuclear-powered carrier during airstrikes against Viet Cong positions near Biên Hòa and throughout South Vietnam on 2 December. Leaving the carrier to continue these &quot;milk-run&quot; strikes, to allow pilots and crew to become accustomed to combat, &quot;Barry&quot; was ordered to the South Vietnamese coast for gunfire support duty. Steaming slowly up the Saigon River near Vũng Tàu on the morning of 7 December, she was given orders to bombard Viet Cong positions several miles east of the river. For two days, her 5-inch (127 mm) guns fired on supply points and entrenchments, getting credit from Army air spotters for &quot;excellent target coverage&quot;, before moving to the Mekong Delta region. Closing the beach near the coastal town of Cho Phước Hải, &quot;Barry&quot; continued fire missions in support of III and IV Naval Zones. After firing some 1,500 5 inch (127 mm) rounds, including opportunity fire near Ba Dong and south of Bung Tau, the destroyer rejoined TG 77.7 on 15 December.

&quot;Enterprise&quot;, steaming off Da Nang at &quot;Point Yankee&quot;, launched a series of strikes at North Vietnamese bridges, roads, and supply centers. &quot;Barry&quot;, screening the carrier as the task group skirted the Gulf of Tonkin, watched as A-4 Skyhawks and F-4 Phantoms struck at North Vietnamese anti-aircraft and radar defense systems. Further strikes, on 22 December, disabled the Uông Bí power complex, the Hải Dương bridge was bombed the following day, and barges and junks were interdicted offshore. Christmas was spent at sea, during an uneasy and temporary truce, and January 1966 saw a resumption of the bombing campaign. &quot;Barry&quot; continued plane guard and screen duties until 17 January when the entire task group arrived at Subic Bay.

Alongside , conducting repairs needed after 48 days of continuous combat operations, the destroyer&#x27;s crew expected a week of upkeep at Subic followed by a liberty in Hong Kong. However, on the very next day, &quot;Barry&quot; received orders to get underway in 36 hours for &quot;special operations&quot; in South Vietnam. After laboring for two straight nights and a day, the destroyer, assisted by repair crews from &quot;Piedmont&quot;, managed to reassemble her machinery in time to steam out of Subic Bay the morning of 19 January.

Attached to III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF), &quot;Barry&quot; was to provide naval gunfire coverage for the landing of 5,000 Marines on beaches north of Đức Phổ in Quảng Ngãi province on 28 January. Three battalions were landed, by helicopter and landing craft, in the largest combat assault since Inchon during the Korean War. Despite light rain and rough weather, the initial stage of Operation &quot;Double Eagle&quot; was completed in two days. As the Marines moved inland, searching for two suspected NVA regiments, they encountered scattered Viet Cong guerrillas instead. For the next five days, &quot;Barry&quot;, with the cruiser , provided fire missions for reconnaissance teams, conducted harassing fire at night, and commanded a South Vietnamese junk patrol designed to counter VC coastal infiltration.

Detached south on 5 February, to support 1st Cavalry and ARVN units in Operation &quot;Masher-White Wing&quot;, &quot;Barry&quot; ranged 150 miles (240 km) of coastline, firing harassing missions against Viet Cong positions. Having fired over 700 5 inch (127 mm) rounds in combat and hosting several 1st Cavalry officers aboard, the destroyer departed 15 February for a liberty in Hong Kong.

&quot;Barry&quot; earned two battle stars for her service in the Vietnam War.

== 1966–1970 ==
Clearing the British Crown Colony on 25 February, &quot;Barry&quot;, after rendezvous with the scattered units of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 24, sailed for Penang, Malaysia. After refueling on 1 March, and the traditional Shellback ceremony south of Singapore, the destroyers &quot;chopped&quot; to U.S. Atlantic Fleet upon arrival at Cochin, India. A reception by Indian naval officers followed before the squadron proceeded to the British Protectorate of Aden. On 12 March &quot;Barry&quot; transited the Suez Canal, pushed on to Naples and Barcelona, before stopping to refuel at Gibraltar, B.C.C. After a final fuel stop at Ponta del Gada, Azores, the destroyers steamed into Newport, having circumnavigated the globe, on 8 April 1966.

After a month of leave and tender availability, &quot;Barry&quot;, and other ships of DesRon 24 conducted two weeks of torpedo firing, gunnery, and engineering training exercises. A brief series of engineering tests were conducted at Boston Naval Shipyard, preparatory to her scheduled overhaul the following January, before a midshipman training cruise and amphibious exercises in June. On 23 July &quot;Barry&quot; entered the Boston shipyard again to begin a gunnery evaluation project.
The project, a single-ship evaluation of the new Mk 86 fire control system, involved the installation of an optical pulse-compression radar and an experimental gun platform on the destroyer. While in drydock, shipyard personnel also completed long-delayed engineering repairs and installed a new SQS-23 sonar transducer. Departing Boston on 6 September, &quot;Barry&quot; spent two months operating out of Newport while Lockheed engineers conducted post-installation tests on the new fire control system. An operational evaluation followed in mid-November when the destroyer sailed to Culebra Island in the Caribbean for the shore bombardment phase of the Mk 86 evaluation. On 5 December, &quot;Barry&quot; departed for Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and the surface firing evaluation in the Jacksonville Operating Area. Despite bad weather and typical &quot;teething&quot; problems, the tedious process was successfully finished on 15 December.

Entering Boston Naval Shipyard on 4 January 1967 for overhaul and ASW conversion, &quot;Barry&quot; was decommissioned on 31 January. She received, after a fifteen-month alteration, a variable depth sonar array (VDS), an antisubmarine rocket launcher (ASROC), a new combat information center (CIC), an enclosed bridge, and completely overhauled propulsion and electrical systems. Recommissioned 19 April 1968, Commander Thomas H. Sherman in command, &quot;Barry&quot; conducted post-overhaul equipment shakedown and shipyard availability for the following year.
On 26 May 1969, after rearming her weapons systems, the destroyer departed for a six-week Caribbean cruise. A week of weapon calibration off St. Croix, and two weeks of refresher training at Guantanamo Bay was followed by a Bar Harbor, Maine, port visit in late July. After rendezvous with ASW Group (HUK), the destroyer steamed to European waters for a four-month North Atlantic deployment. In between NATO exercises, including Arctic Circle operations, she visited Antwerp, Oslo, Bergen, and Le Havre for goodwill visits before sailing for Newport on 1 December. Three days later, appropriately while on plane guard duty, &quot;Barry&quot; rescued the crew of a disabled helicopter.

For the next two years, except for a brief October 1970 deployment to Greece in response to the Jordanian-PLO conflict, the destroyer operated on a routine schedule of type training, operational exercises, port visits, and annual midshipmen cruises. After a three-month regular yard period in early 1972, &quot;Barry&quot; conducted refresher training, gunfire support qualifications, and ASROC antisubmarine rocket firing tests in the Caribbean. Then, as part of a new forward deployment program, &quot;Barry&quot; began preparations to change her home port to Athens, Greece.

== 1972–1976 ==
Departing 18 August, she joined the 6th Fleet at Rota, Spain, before sailing into Athens on 1 September. There she joined DESRON 12 along with USS &quot;Sampson&quot;, USS &quot;Richard Byrd&quot;, USS &quot;William Wood&quot;, USS &quot;Manley&quot;, and USS &quot;Vreeland&quot;. Following a month-long stand down to settle crew and dependents in new housing, &quot;Barry&quot; began intensive Fleet operations. NATO exercises with Greek and Turkish ships; goodwill port visits to Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Greece; and ASW training, highlighted by the surfacing of a Soviet Foxtrot-class diesel submarine on 11 January, continued well into 1973.

On 3 July, &quot;Barry&quot; received an upgrade to her AN/SQS-23 sonar at Hellenic Shipyards, Athens. Port visits to Istanbul, Turkey and Thessaloniki, Greece. In October, &quot;Barry&quot; was undergoing repairs in the shipyard in Parama, Greece. All hands were recalled to the ship during the night to begin the assembly of the ship in preparation for deployment as an ASW screen ship for the Marine Landing Battalion stationed off the Suez in response to the Soviet naval buildup during the Arab–Israeli war. After receiving clearance to operate &quot;Barry&quot; steamed to join the 6th Fleet&#x27;s Amphibious Task Forces. On 16 November, while on reserve station south of Crete, a Marine CH-46 helicopter from lost engine power during a routine flight while hovering above &quot;Barry&quot;. With crew members aboard, the craft crashed into the destroyer&#x27;s ASROC deck, rolled over the starboard side, and almost immediately sank. No one on &quot;Barry&quot; was injured. The ship&#x27;s motor whaleboat rescued two members of the three helicopter crew. The ship was immediately sent back to flight quarters to receive a flight surgeon by helicopter to treat the injured airman. &quot;Barry&quot; returned to Athens for Thanksgiving before resuming further contingency operations, mostly as a carrier escort, which lasted until the end of the year.
The destroyer conducted standard patrol operations in 1974. 1974 was highlighted by the commissioning of the US Naval pier in Elefsis, Greece, allowing the ship to go cold iron while in port—providing much-needed relief to the ship and the crew, which had been steaming near continuously since the ship had departed Newport. While anchored in Phalron Bay, in July &quot;Barry&quot; witnessed the Greek fleet sortie from its base at Salamis with the outbreak of hostilities in the Cyprus Crisis. &quot;Barry&quot; evacuated approximately 50 military personnel and others from Athens to Naples, Italy and then returned to the Aegean for a month of tense operations during the Cyprus crisis of August and the tracking of an active sonar contact while Admiral James L. Holloway, CNO, was aboard on 19 September. After NATO Exercise &quot;Sardinia 75&quot; in April, including type training with Italian ships, &quot;Barry&quot; began preparations to leave Athens after the Greek government canceled the naval station agreement.

Departing 20 July, after 36 months of forward deployment, the destroyer steamed via Villefranche-sur-Mer, France; Palma de Mallorca and Rota, Spain, before arriving at Philadelphia on 20 August. The remainder of the year was spent in port. During this period &quot;Barry&quot; received the Arleigh Burke award, which was presented by Admiral Isaac Kidd, first CO of &quot;Barry&quot;. Except for her participation in the 200th Navy birthday celebration in New York City, the remainder of the year was spent conducting training exercises or in port. In February 1976, after a three-week ASW training cruise off the coast of Rhode Island, she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for her first major overhaul period since 1968.

== 1977–1979 ==
&quot;Barry&quot; remained in the yard until 9 February 1977, when she departed for sea trials. She transferred her homeport to Naval Station Mayport, Florida, on 4 March and began a series of shakedown exercises, including weapons qualifications training, that culminated in her fifth deployment to the Mediterranean. She rendezvoused with the carrier on 29 September, steamed to Lisbon, Portugal, and then on to Naples, Italy, before joining 6th Fleet operations. On the night of 10 November, &quot;Barry&quot; assisted in the successful rescue, primarily with boats and searchlights, of two crewmembers of an aircraft that had ditched on approach to &quot;America&quot;. After several missile exercises, ASW training, and a port visit to Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, &quot;Barry&quot; finished out her year moored alongside in Naples, Italy.
Following a routine visit to Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, &quot;Barry&quot; steamed through the Straits of Messina in response to an Eastern Mediterranean cruise by units of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Between 24 January and 3 February 1978, the destroyer shadowed the (TAKR) and (PKR) Task Group while it operated in the Levantine Basin. &quot;Barry&quot; observed and evaluated &quot;Kiev&quot;″s underway replenishment ability, flight operations and sea-keeping characteristics before returning to Italy. Following &quot;Exercise Sardinia 78&quot;, part of NATO&#x27;s National Week XIV, &quot;Barry&quot; began a series of exercises off Sicily and Valencia, Spain, before departing for Mayport, Florida, on 14 April. Underway again in late June, the destroyer operated in the Mayport and Chesapeake Bay areas until early August when she prepared for a northern European cruise. Departing on 22 August, as part of Exercise &quot;Common Effort&quot;, &quot;Barry&quot; helped demonstrate NATO&#x27;s capability to replenish Europe by sea. Operation &quot;Northern Wedding&quot;, a major NATO exercise, took place in early September and was followed by a routine port visit to Copenhagen, Denmark. Another NATO exercise, &quot;BALTOP&#x27;s 78&quot;, took place in the Skagerrak and Baltic Sea with units from Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway, through 3 October. &quot;Barry&quot; then sailed to Helsinki, Finland, her first visit since 1960, before port visits at Bremen, Germany, and Amsterdam, Netherlands. She also stopped at Middlesbrough, United Kingdom, for the Captain James Cook (RN) Festival, before sailing for home. After a brief stop at the Azores to refuel, the destroyer arrived at Mayport on 8 November for upkeep.

The new year began with ASW and naval gunfire support operations off Jacksonville and Puerto Rico until February when &quot;Barry&quot; underwent repair and maintenance availability in preparation for another Mediterranean deployment. In company with Battle Group 2 (BG2), the destroyer reached Gibraltar on 24 March to begin a series of port visits. On a routine cruise to &quot;show the flag&quot;, the ship visited Tunis, Tunisia; Crotone, Italy; Monaco; Toulon, France; and La Spezia, Italy, before participating in National Week XXV with Italian naval units.

Underway on 2 June 1979, in company with , &quot;Barry&quot; sailed for the Suez Canal, transiting the waterway on 6 June en route to Djibouti. After a refueling stop and detaching from &quot;Sampson&quot;, she proceeded to Karachi, Pakistan, for a routine port visit. On arrival on 16 June, she flew the flag of Rear Admiral Samuel H. Packer II, Commander Middle East Forces. Due to the revolutionary events in Iran, the Islamic Republic having been declared 1 April, &quot;Barry&quot;″s next orders deployed her into the Persian Gulf to support American civilians/personnel in Iran and reassure friendly countries in the region. Arriving at Bahrain on 23 June, she underwent repair availability before starting patrol operations in the Persian Gulf on 4 July. After a port visit to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, she conducted surveillance and counter-terrorism patrols in the Straits of Hormuz. Joined by the Sultanate of Oman Navy in these patrols and interspersed with fuel stops at Muscat, Oman and Sitrah, Bahrain, &quot;Barry&quot; continued routine patrols until 31 July when she departed for Djibouti. After a brief fuel stop, she then stopped in Victoria, Seychelles for a port visit before rendezvousing with &quot;Sampson&quot; and on 20 August for a return to the Mediterranean. She transited the Suez Canal on 25 August and then visited Barcelona, Spain, eventually rejoining BG-2 at Rota, Spain. Underway for Mayport, Florida, the destroyer arrived home on 21 September for post-deployment leave and upkeep. The remainder of the year was spent conducting local operations out of Mayport and preparing for a scheduled overhaul the following year.

== 1980–1982 ==
On 17 January 1980, &quot;Barry&quot;″s homeport was changed to Boston, and the following day, she entered Bethlehem Steel Shipyard, Boston, for a year-long regular overhaul. Once hull maintenance began, the crew moved into quarters ashore as extensive repair and overhaul of the engineering plant, electronic suite, and weapons systems were performed. The ship departed drydock on 7 August and moored alongside Pier #2 to complete the remaining repair work. Ultimately, &quot;Barry&quot; got underway on 31 March 1981 for her shakedown. Over the next few months, the ship ranged from Newport to the Virginia Capes, working to rejoin the fleet, spending much of that time on local operations in the Narragansett Bay area. While conducting further refresher training in the Bahamas and at Guantanamo Bay, operations were suddenly canceled when the ship received a message directing her to return to Newport to prepare for a Middle East deployment.
&quot;Barry&quot; steamed for her assignment on 10 November 1981, bound for Hamilton, Bermuda on the first leg of her transit of the Atlantic. The ship sailed for the Azores and thence into the Mediterranean, ultimately transiting the Suez Canal on 26–27 November. Joining an Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG) formed around , , and , &quot;Barry&quot; helped escort these ships through the Bab el Mandeb Straits on the 29th. Steaming separately, the destroyer touched at Djibouti for fuel on 30 November, before joining with the battle group formed around on 1 December.

&quot;Barry&quot; remained with that unit for a week, acting as a screen and naval gunfire support ship during Operation &quot;Bright Star &#x27;82&quot;. Following the exercise, the destroyer escorted the ARG&#x27;s ships back through the Straits of Bab el Mandeb before &quot;Barry&quot; proceeded down to Mombasa, Kenya, arriving there on 21 December. She remained at Mombasa for the remainder of 1981, departing the Kenyan port on 2 January 1982 to head back to the Persian Gulf. Patrol operations in the Persian Gulf lasted until 9 March, when the destroyer headed home. She reached Newport, via Málaga, Spain, on 9 April.

Over the ensuing months, &quot;Barry&quot;″s schedule of operations was fairly light; she provided support for the American Sail Training Association&#x27;s &quot;Tall Ships &#x27;82&quot; race, visited Bristol, R.I., and served as escort and host ship for the Italian cruiser &quot;Duilio&quot; during that ship&#x27;s visit to New York City and Philadelphia.

As part of a destroyer replacement program, on 1 September, the ship commenced her final decommissioning stand down in Newport, and on 5 November 1982, &quot;Barry&quot; was decommissioned. Five days later, under tow of , she was on her way to the Inactive Ship Facility at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, reaching that facility on 12 November 1982.

== Museum ship, 1984–2015 ==
After &quot;Barry&quot;&#x27;s decommissioning, retired Admiral Arleigh Burke advocated that a U.S. Navy display ship be moored at the Washington Navy Yard on the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. The Navy chose &quot;Barry&quot;. She was towed from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and arrived at her mooring at the Washington Navy Yard on 18 November 1983. After volunteers repainted the ship and installed museum displays aboard her, &quot;Barry&quot; opened to the public as Display Ship &quot;Barry&quot; (DS &quot;Barry&quot;) in 1984, co-located with the National Museum of the United States Navy but administratively separate from the museum. She served as a distinctive attraction for visitors to the historic area, her former ASROC magazine converted to a display area and with some of her internal areas opened for visitors to tour, including the machine repair shop, the crew berthing room, the wardroom, the mess deck, the bridge, and the combat information center (CIC).

In her early years as a museum ship, DS &quot;Barry&quot; was a popular attraction, becoming a regular stop for tour buses and school groups; in 1990 alone, 500,000 people visited her. She frequently hosted retirement ceremonies for U.S. Navy officers on her after deck. She also appeared briefly in the background of many television programs; for example, she appeared in two episodes of the CBS television drama &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;Dead Reflections,&quot; which aired on 12 April 2011, and &quot;Newborn King,&quot; which aired on 13 December 2011.

== Disposal ==

The number of visitors to DS &quot;Barry&quot; began to decline after 1990, and by 2015 had dwindled to only about 10,000 people per year. Although &quot;Barry&quot;″s hull remained seaworthy, it had begun to deteriorate. She required about $2 million in repairs and renovations, an amount the U.S. Navy deemed unaffordable given the low annual number of visitors. Meanwhile, the District of Columbia government had made plans to replace the existing Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, a swing bridge, with a new bridge, construction of which was to begin in October 2015. The District of Columbia considered replacing the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge with another swing bridge but found that adding a swing capability to the new bridge would add $140 million to its cost plus an additional $100,000 per year for maintenance; instead, the city government opted for a fixed-span bridge that, when complete, would trap &quot;Barry&quot; in the Anacostia River.

For all these reasons, the U.S. Navy decided to close DS &quot;Barry&quot; and tow her away for scrapping before construction of the new bridge advanced to the point of trapping her in the Anacostia River. During the summer of 2015, representatives of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval History and Heritage Command, followed by representatives of approved non-profit museum ships, visited &quot;Barry&quot; and removed artifacts from her for display elsewhere, with communications gear being the most popular items. A formal departure ceremony for the ship hosted by Naval Support Activity Washington, attended by more than 50 former &quot;Barry&quot; crew members and featuring a speech by retired Rear Admiral Sam Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, took place on 17 October 2015 in the Cold War gallery at the Washington Navy Yard.

On 7 May 2016, DS &quot;Barry&quot; had her masts cut down and, with a mixed caretaker crew of U.S. Navy and towing company personnel aboard was towed from the Washington Navy Yard by the commercial tugs &quot;Emily Ann&quot;, &quot;Meagan Ann&quot;, and &quot;Thomas D. Witte&quot;. As the ship was towed down the Anacostia River to the Potomac River, a Washington, D.C., fireboat saluted her with a water cannon display, and Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling played the U.S. Navy anthem &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; over loudspeakers ashore. &quot;Barry&quot; was to make a 50-hour journey via the Potomac River, Chesapeake Bay, Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and Delaware River to the inactive ship facility at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, from which she had been towed to Washington in 1983. There she would be mothballed and sold for scrapping. Scrapping was completed by 11 February 2022.

<text>The voiceless bilabial plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound used in most spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

==Features==
Features of the voiceless bilabial plosive:


== Varieties ==
==Occurrence==

Research has shown that incidental learning positively impacts the acquisition of the /p/ sound for Arabic speakers and other EFL learners. This is particularly interesting given that the stop is missing from about 10% of languages that have a . (See voiced velar stop for another such gap.) This is an areal feature of the circum-Saharan zone (Africa north of the equator plus the Arabian Peninsula). It is not known how old this areal feature is, and whether it might be a recent phenomenon due to Arabic as a prestige language, or whether Arabic was itself affected by a more ancient areal pattern. It is found in other areas as well; for example, Fijian, Onge, and many Papuan languages have but no .

Nonetheless, the sound is very common cross-linguistically. Most languages have at least a plain , and some distinguish more than one variety. Many Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindustani, have a two-way contrast between the aspirated and the plain (also transcribed as in extensions to the IPA).

<text>:&quot;See USS &quot;Decatur&quot; for other ships of the same name.&quot;

The fourth USS &quot;Decatur&quot; (DD-936) was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer of the United States Navy in service from 1956 to 1983. She was named for Commodore Stephen Decatur USN (1779–1820). &quot;Decatur&quot; was modernised as a guided missile destroyer in the mid-1960s and re-designated DDG-31. After her decommissioning in 1983, she operated as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Self Defense Test Ship from 1994 to 2003. She was finally sunk as a target the following year.

==History==

===1956-1966===
&quot;Decatur&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 13 September 1954, launched on 15 December 1955 by Mrs. W. A. Pierce and Mrs. D. J. Armsden, descendants of Commodore Decatur and commissioned on 7 December 1956.

In 1957, she made her shakedown cruise through the Caribbean area, ran special trials, and steamed to northern Europe. Early in 1958 the new destroyer again crossed the Atlantic to begin her first Sixth Fleet tour in the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Decatur&quot; made more such deployments during the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as serving as a spacecraft recovery ship in September 1961 and taking part in Cuban Quarantine operations in November and December 1962. On 6 May 1964, her superstructure was heavily damaged in a collision with the aircraft carrier &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; (CVS-39). The unrepaired &quot;Decatur&quot; was placed &quot;in commission, in reserve&quot; later in the year to await modernization, and was formally decommissioned on 15 June 1965.

===1966-1983===
During the next two years &quot;Decatur&quot; was extensively modified at the Boston Naval Shipyard, Massachusetts. She was reclassified as a guided-missile destroyer in September 1966, receiving the new hull number DDG-31, and was recommissioned in April 1967 with CDR Lee Baggett Jr. in command. In September that year she transferred to the Pacific Fleet, her assignment for the remainder of her commissioned service. &quot;Decatur&quot;&#x27;s first Seventh Fleet deployment, in the Western Pacific, took place between July 1968 and February 1969. In this, and her next two Far Eastern tours in 1970 and 1971–72, she engaged in Vietnam War operations and visited southern Pacific nations. Further &quot;WestPac&quot; cruises took place in 1973, 1974–75, 1976–77 and 1978–1979. The last deployment also took her into the Indian Ocean, an area of increasing interest to the U.S. Navy as the Persian Gulf region became unstable.

In 1981 and again in 1982, &quot;Decatur&quot; steamed across the Pacific for more duty with the Seventh Fleet and, in 1983, in the Persian Gulf. At the end of June 1983, several weeks after returning from her last deployment, she was decommissioned and placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. USS &quot;Decatur&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1988. Her name was canceled sometime thereafter.

===1994-2003===

However, the ship had a long career ahead of her as Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS), a role for which she was converted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ship had &quot;E31&quot; painted on the hull during this time. From 1994 to 2003 she was employed along the Pacific Coast, conducting trials of various systems for countering anti-shipping cruise missiles and other threats. After being replaced as SDTS by the decommissioned she was disposed of in support of Fleet training exercise 22 July 2004. Decatur appears briefly in background footage in the television crime-drama &quot;NCIS&quot; (Season 1, Episode 7 &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; (2003) as well as briefly in the background of &quot;JAG&quot; (Season 5 Episode 4 &quot;The Return&quot;)

<text>Scrying, also referred to as &quot;seeing&quot; or &quot;peeping,&quot; is a practice rooted in divination and fortune-telling. It involves gazing into a medium, hoping to receive significant messages or visions that could offer personal guidance, prophecy, revelation, or inspiration. The practice lacks a definitive distinction from other forms of clairvoyance or divination but generally relies on visions within the chosen medium. Unlike augury, which interprets observable events, or divination, which follows standardized rituals, scrying&#x27;s impressions arise within the medium itself.

The terminology and methods of scrying are diverse and lack a standardized structure. Practitioners coin terms such as &quot;crystallomancy,&quot; &quot;spheromancy,&quot; or &quot;catoptromancy,&quot; naming practices based on the medium or technique employed. These practices have been reinvented throughout history, spanning cultures and regions. Scrying media encompass reflective, refractive, or luminescent surfaces like crystals, mirrors, water, fire, or smoke. Some practitioners even close their eyes, engaging in &quot;eyelid scrying.&quot;

Methods of scrying often include self-induced trances, using media like crystal balls or even modern technology like smartphones. Practitioners enter a focused state that reduces mental clutter, enabling the emergence of visual images. These initial images, however trivial, are amplified during the trance. Some scryers report that they hear their voice affirming what they see, creating a mental feedback loop.

Throughout history, various traditions and cultures have practiced scrying as a means of revealing the past, present, or future. The practice involves diverse media, from reflective surfaces to shimmering mirages, and is often accompanied by rituals inducing altered states of consciousness. Despite its popularity in occult circles and its portrayal in media, scrying lacks empirical support and is met with skepticism from the scientific community.

==Definitions and terminology==
There is no definitive distinction between scrying and other aids to clairvoyance, augury, or divination, but roughly speaking, scrying depends on impressions of visions in the medium of choice. Ideally in this respect it differs from augury, which relies on interpretations of objectively observable objects or events (such as flight of birds); from divination, which depends on standardized processes or rituals; from oneiromancy, which depends on the interpretation of dreams; from the physiological effects of psychoactive drugs; and from clairvoyance, which notionally does not depend on objective sensory stimuli. Clairvoyance in other words, is regarded as amounting in essence to extrasensory perception. 
Scrying is neither a single, clearly defined, nor formal discipline and there is no uniformity in the procedures, which repeatedly and independently have been reinvented or elaborated in many ages and regions. Furthermore, practitioners and writers coin terminology so arbitrarily, and often artificially, that no one system of nomenclature can be taken as authoritative and definitive. Commonly terms in use are Latinisations or of descriptions of the media or activities. Examples of names coined for crystal gazing include &#x27;crystallomancy&#x27;, &#x27;spheromancy&#x27;, and &#x27;catoptromancy&#x27;. As an example of the looseness of such terms, catoptromancy should refer more specifically to scrying by use of mirrors or other reflective objects rather than by crystal gazing. Other names that have been coined for the use of various scrying media include anthracomancy for glowing coals, turifumy for scrying into smoke, and hydromancy for scrying into water. There is no clear limit to the coining and application of such terms and media.

Scrying has been practiced in many cultures in the belief that it can reveal the past, present, or future. Some practitioners assert that visions that come when one stares into the media are from the subconscious or imagination, while others say that they come from gods, spirits, devils, or the psychic mind, depending on the culture and practice. There is neither any systematic body of empirical support for any such views in general however, nor for their respective rival merits; individual preferences in such matters are arbitrary.

==Media==
The media most commonly used in scrying are reflective, refractive, translucent, or luminescent surfaces or objects such as crystals, stones, or glass in various shapes such as crystal balls, mirrors, reflective black surfaces such as obsidian, water surfaces, fire, or smoke, but there is no special limitation on the preferences or prejudices of the scryer; some may stare into pitch dark, clear sky, clouds, shadows, or light patterns against walls, ceilings, or pond beds. Some prefer glowing coals or shimmering mirages. Some simply close their eyes, notionally staring at the insides of their own eyelids, and speak of &quot;eyelid scrying&quot;.

Scrying media generally either suggest images directly (such as figures in fire, fluid eddies, or clouds), or else they distort or reflect the observers&#x27; vision confusingly, in the manner to be seen in crystals or transparent balls. Such fancies have long been satirised by sceptics, for example in &quot;Hamlet&quot; III.ii:

&lt;poem&gt;
Do you see yonder cloud that&#x27;s almost in shape of a camel?
By the mass, and &#x27;tis like a camel, indeed.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
It is backed like a weasel.
Or like a whale?
Very like a whale.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Alternatively the medium might reduce visual stimuli to thresholds below which any clear impressions could interfere with fancied visions or free association. Examples include darkened reflections of night sky, or plain shadow or darkness.

== Methods ==

One class of methods of scrying involves a self-induced trance, with or without the aid of a medium such as a crystal ball or, even via modern technology such as a smartphone among other things. Some say that the sensation is drug-like, some that various drugs can potentiate the experience; others categorically exclude any connection with drug usage, believing that it invalidates any images observed.

Many practitioners say that the scrying medium initially serves to focus attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind in much the same way as repetition of a mantra, concentration on a mandala, inducing the relaxation response, or possibly by hypnosis. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer may begin free association with the perceived images. The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, attempts to deepen the trance state. In this state some scryers hear their own disassociated voices affirming what they see, in a mental feedback loop.

Practitioners apply the process until they achieve a satisfactory state of perception in which rich visual images and dramatic stories seem to be projected within the medium itself, or in the mind&#x27;s eye of the scryer. They report that the technique allows them to see relevant events or images within the chosen medium.

Nostradamus practiced scrying; he would stare into a bowl of water or a magic mirror to see the future while he was in trance.

== Religion and mythology ==
===Hebrew Bible===
Divination is briefly mentioned in chapter 44 of the Book of Genesis. A silver chalice or cup is deliberately planted in Benjamin&#x27;s sack when he leaves Egypt, later to be used as evidence of theft. It is revealed the cup belongs to Joseph, the vizier of Egypt, whose steward said it was used for drinking and divination during the course of his accusation. This is mentioned to reinforce his disguise as an Egyptian nobleman. Nothing in the book of Genesis indicates that Joseph actually used the cup for divination.

=== Ancient Persia ===

The &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, a 10th-century epic work narrating historical and mythological past of Persia, gives a description of what was called the Cup of Jamshid (&quot;Jaam-e Jam&quot;), which was used by the ancient (mythological) Persian kings for observing all of the seven layers of the universe. The cup was said to contain an elixir of immortality, but without cogent explanation for any relevance of the elixir to the scrying function.

=== Latter Day Saint movement ===

In the late 1820s, Joseph Smith founded the Latter Day Saint movement based in part on insights gained from the reflections of seer stones. Smith had at least three separate stones which he used initially in treasure-hunting expeditions. Subsequently, he took to placing his favorite stone inside his hat to read what he said were miraculous reflections from the stone. Smith also said he possessed a pair of spectacles manufactured from seer stones, which he called the Urim and Thummim and which he said enabled him to translate the golden plates that are the stated source of the Book of Mormon.

==In folklore==

Rituals that involve many acts similar to scrying in ceremonial magic are retained in the form of folklore and superstition. A formerly widespread tradition held that young women gazing into a mirror in a darkened room (often on Halloween) could catch a glimpse of their future husband&#x27;s face in the mirror — or a skull personifying Death if their fate was to die before they married.

Another form of the tale, involving the same actions of gazing into a mirror in a darkened room, is used as a supernatural dare in the tale of &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;. Here, the motive is usually to test the adolescent gazers&#x27; mettle against a malevolent witch or ghost, in a ritual designed to allow the scryers&#x27; easy escape if the visions summoned prove too frightening.

Folklore superstitions such as those just mentioned, are not to be distinguished clearly from traditional tales, within which the reality of such media are taken for granted. In the fairytale of Snow White for example, the jealous queen consults a magic mirror, which she asks &quot;Magic mirror on the wall / Who is the fairest of them all?&quot;, to which the mirror always replies &quot;You, my queen, are fairest of all.&quot; But when Snow White reaches the age of seven, she becomes as beautiful as the day, and when the queen asks her mirror, it responds: &quot;Queen, you are full fair, &#x27;tis true, but Snow White is fairer than you.&quot; There is no uniformity among believers, in how seriously they prefer to take such tales and superstitions.

== In Western esotericism ==

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1888-c.1902 in its original form) taught their own version of scrying that could be done individually or as a group. It emphasized three levels:
#&quot;Scrying in the Spirit Vision&quot; with an emphasis on inner seeing by focusing on a symbol or mirror, 
#&quot;Traveling in the Spirit Vision&quot; involves going to the place seen and interacting with what is found there,
#&quot;Rising on the Planes&quot; focuses on a spiritual process (involving scrying via the Tree of Life) that has the potential to elevate consciousness to the level of the Divine.

==Scientific reception==
Scrying is not supported by science as a method of predicting the future or obtaining information unavailable to empirical investigation. Some critics consider it to be a pseudoscience. Skeptics consider scrying to be the result of delusion or wishful thinking.

Psychologist Leonard Zusne suggested that scrying images are hallucinations or hypnagogic experiences.

A 2010 paper in the journal &quot;Perception&quot; identified one specific method of reliably reproducing a scrying illusion in a mirror and hypothesized that it &quot;might be caused by low level fluctuations in the stability of edges, shading and outlines affecting the perceived definition of the face, which gets over-interpreted as ‘someone else’ by the face recognition system.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Davis&quot; (DD-937) was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer of the United States Navy laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 1 February 1955. The ship was named for Commander George Fleming Davis USN (1911-1945), commanding officer of USS &quot;Walke&quot; (DD-723), killed in action at Lingayen Gulf on Luzon in the Philippine Islands on 6 January 1945, and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. &quot;Davis&quot; was launched on 28 March 1956 by Mrs. G. F. Davis, widow of Commander Davis, and commissioned on 6 March 1957 at Boston Naval Yard.

==Building and commissioning==
The unnamed Forrest Sherman-class destroyer DD-937 was laid down on 1 February 1955 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by Bethlehem Steel Co. The ship was named Davis on 5 December 1955 and was launched on 28 March 1956 sponsored by Mrs. George F. Davis, widow of the late Commander George Fleming Davis. The ship departed her building yard on 28 February 1957 and arrived at Boston Naval Shipyard, where she was commissioned on 6 March 1957.

==Service history==
After fitting out and undergoing preparations for sea, &quot;Davis&quot; departed the Boston Naval Shipyard on 23 April 1957 for trials off Brenton Reef, returning on 25 April. She sailed for Naval Station Newport, her assigned home port, on 2 May, arriving at her destination the same day. After undergoing an administrative inspection there on 10 May, she got underway for Cuban waters. She paused at the Washington Navy Yard from 17 to 20 May for Armed Forces Day celebrations, then embarked the Harbor and Rivers Commission for a cruise down the Potomac River. After stopping briefly at Naval Station Norfolk from 21 to 23 May, &quot;Davis&quot; pushed on for Guantanamo Bay, reaching her destination on 26 May. She conducted her shakedown cruise from those waters through mid-July, punctuating that training with visits to Kingston, Jamaica from 15 to 16 June and Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic from 4 to 7 July.

&quot;Davis&quot; departed Guantanamo Bay on 15 July 1957 for a post-shakedown cruise to northern European waters, visiting Culebra (17 July) and San Juan, Puerto Rico from 17 to 19 July en route to the Azores. Pausing only briefly at Ponta Delgada (25 July), &quot;Davis&quot; then visited Rotterdam, Netherlands from 29 July to 2 August, Copenhagen, Denmark from 12 to 17 August and Edinburgh, Scotland from 19 to 22 August. She returned to Boston Naval Shipyard on 29 August for post-shakedown availability that kept her in yard hands (except a brief period at sea on 5–6 November) until 8 November, when she got underway to return to her home port Newport, arriving the following day. She became flagship for Captain Harry G. Moore, Commander, Destroyer Squadron (ComDesRon) 12, in November upon completion of that yard period.

Sailing for the Mediterranean and operations with the Sixth Fleet on 29 November 1957, &quot;Davis&quot; exercised and trained at sea until standing in to Cannes, France, on 16 December, where she remained through the Christmas and New Years&#x27; holidays. Sailing on 3 January 1958, the destroyer operated with the Sixth Fleet into the spring, punctuating her at-sea periods, during which time she participated in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and air defense exercises and plane guarded a succession of attack carriers: , , and , and with visits to Pollensa Bay, Mallorca (5–7 January), Valetta, Malta (11–16 January), Piraeus, Greece (18–22 January), İskenderun (29–30 January) and İzmir (1–4 February), Turkey, and Rhodes, Greece (11–18 February), Genoa, Italy (22–28 February), Barcelona, Spain (10–17 March and 18–21 March). After pausing briefly at Gibraltar (1–3 April) as she left the Mediterranean, homeward-bound, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to Newport on 12 April.

Following post-deployment upkeep, the ship remained at her home port through early June 1958, logging a port call to New London, Connecticut, between 16 and 19 May. Davis then paused briefly at Boston (10–12 June) before she sailed for northern Europe on a midshipman cruise. During the course of that period of training, the destroyer visited Kiel, West Germany, for Kiel Week (25–30 June), Bergen, Norway (9–16 July) and Rotterdam (19–24 July). She ultimately returned to Boston on 4 August, disembarking midshipmen and beginning a period of post-deployment repairs and alterations that included the strengthening of her aluminum deckhouses and the installation of new expansion joints.

Emerging from the yard on 14 October 1958, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to her home port the following day, but remained there only a short time, sailing on 20 October to operate as part of Anti-Submarine Defense Forces, Atlantic, conducting advanced ASW training, until setting course to return to port on 3 November, standing in the following day. Sailing again on 1 December, she reached Norfolk the next day, and remained there, members of her crew given the opportunity to attend ASW Tactical School there, until her departure on 8 December for another stint of operations at sea. Heading for home on 15 December, she arrived on the 16th. She remained there into the first week of January 1959.

Davis sailed from Newport on 7 January 1959, then participated in Operation Springboard in the Caribbean operating areas, completing type training requirements and interspersing those evolutions with port visits to San Juan (11–12 January), Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico (13–14 January), Ciudad Trujillo (16–21 January), San Juan (23–26 January) and Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands (30 January – 2 February). Returning to her home port on 9 February, Davis remained there until 26 February, when she stood out en route to Washington, D.C., which she visited between 28 February and 5 March. Visits to Naval Station Mayport, Florida (8–10 March), Charleston, South Carolina (11–13 March) and Norfolk (14 March) followed; then, after unloading ammunition at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Earle, New Jersey, (15–16 March), the ship then entered the Boston Naval Shipyard on 17 March.

Following an extensive upkeep and overhaul period, &quot;Davis&quot; departed Boston on 17 June 1959, and paused at Newport (19–23 June) before steaming to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she took part in Independence Day observances during her stay (3–5 July). Proceeding thence to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training, &quot;Davis&quot; reached her destination on the morning of 11 July, but before the day was out, stood out to sea to patrol off the western and southern coasts of Haiti. Operating under Commander Caribbean Sea Frontier during her time off the island (12–16 July), Davis and her squadron-mates performed a deterrent mission, preventing neighboring nations from interfering in the internal affairs of Haiti during President Francois Duvalier&#x27;s recovery from a heart attack. &quot;The presence of the U.S. Navy bolstered the internal fortitude of Haiti,&quot; wrote one observer, &quot;and was a major factor in maintaining peace in the Caribbean area.&quot; Davis visited Port au Prince, Haiti (1 August), returned to Cuban waters on 3 August, after which time she operated off Culebra, Puerto Rico, then conducted &quot;special operations.&quot; Upon completion of that work, &quot;Davis&quot; stood out, bound for Newport, which she reached on 17 August, continuing her work to prepare for, and take part in, the annual competitive exercises. Subsequently, from 26 October 1959 the ship participated in Operation Tralex 4-59, evaluating &quot;convoy procedures and amphibious assault operations,&quot; upon completion of which she returned to her home port on 7 November, for a tender overhaul before resuming operations with the Anti-Submarine Defense Force, Atlantic, beginning in December.

===1960s===
&quot;Davis&quot; again headed southward, bound for the Caribbean, on 18 January 1960. After providing support for Operation Skyhook, an Office of Naval Research project, part of activities undertaken during the International Geophysical Year, &quot;measuring...cosmic radiation at high altitude over the Caribbean area,&quot; the ship then spent the remainder of her one-month cruise engaged in extensive ASW operations. During that time, she and the other units of DesRon 12 received the nickname &quot;Dragon Killers&quot; in reference to one of their adversaries in the training evolutions being the new nuclear submarine . A five-day visit to San Juan, Puerto Rico, capped the cruise in that region, and she ultimately returned to Newport on 18 February. After operating as part of an ASW Ready Group (7-21 March) in the North Atlantic, practicing &quot;hunter-killer&quot; operations, &quot;Davis&quot; completed her competitive exercises (March–April 1960) earning seven gunnery &quot;E&quot; awards for outstanding shooting. She spent May 1960 engaged in upkeep alongside a tender and spent June and July in extensive operations as part of the Second Fleet, participating in LantFlex 2-60. In mid-July, Davis received word that Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, had designated her as the winner of the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for &quot;outstanding performance in all areas of endeavor.&quot;

On 4 August 1960, DesRon 12 sailed for the Mediterranean, and upon joining the Sixth Fleet &quot;were assigned to various Task Units. Subsequently, wrote one squadron chronicler, none of DesRon 12&#x27;s ships operated together again in 1960, although &quot;Davis&quot; and proceeded into the Black Sea &quot;on a special assignment,&quot; the third and fourth U.S. warships to enter that body of water since World War II. &quot;Considerable publicity&quot; ensued as the Soviet Union protested what it termed &quot;provocative action.&quot; As the year 1960 ended, Davis had returned to the western Mediterranean.

&quot;Davis&quot; and DesRon 12 departed Pollensa Bay and the Sixth Fleet for Rota, Spain, and thence, to the continental United States on 13 February 1961, and reached their home port eleven days later to begin leave periods and pre-yard tender availabilities. &quot;Davis&quot; departed Newport on 4 April for Boston Naval Shipyard, where she received a scheduled overhaul to machinery and equipment. Upon completion of that period of yard work on 5 July, &quot;Davis&quot; took ammunition on board, then visited New York City; returning to her home port to prepare for refresher training. She operated daily off Newport, getting ready for the slated work in Cuban waters. She sailed on 24 July for Guantanamo Bay, arriving on 28 July whence she conducted &quot;long and difficult, yet extremely valuable, training...liberally spiced with patrols and exercises, in view of the existing Cuban situation...&quot; that included taking part in an exercise (25 August) that featured a &quot;simulated Atomic underwater burst...&quot; &quot;Davis&quot; sailed for Key West, Florida, on 8 September, there to provide services for the Fleet Sonar School.

Standing out from Key West on 14 September 1961, Davis paid a visit to Norfolk en route back to her home port. Hurricane Esther, however, compelled a change in plans. When the storm forced the evacuation of the crew from Texas Tower 3, Davis received orders to guard the facility. Ultimately, the abatement of the hurricane-force winds permitted the ship to return to Newport on 22 September. During October 1961, the destroyer then took part in a two-week training evolution as part of Task Force 22, of the Second Fleet, off the Virginia capes. During November, &quot;Davis&quot; and deployed twice with TF-140, supporting the recovery operations of Enos, the chimpanzee from the Mercury-Atlas 5 space mission. During the first deployment, on 14 November, &quot;Davis&quot; transferred her hospital corpsman to the Swedish oil tanker &quot;Seven Skies&quot; to aid an injured crewman. She returned to Newport on 1 December 1961 for upkeep that included a tender availability, and remained in her home port through the beginning of the new year.

On 7 February 1962, &quot;Davis&quot; departed for the Mediterranean in company with &quot;Harlan R. Dickson&quot;, , , and ; &quot;Compton&quot;, delayed by last-minute repairs at Newport, caught up with them at Gibraltar. Becoming a part of the Sixth Fleet on 17 February, DesRon 12 relieved DesRon 22 two days later, its ships, including the squadron flagship, &quot;Davis&quot;, deployed among various task forces as before.

During her time in the Sixth Fleet, the ship continued the type of work performed in the past, exercises punctuated by port calls. In July, she received word that she had won gunnery and supply department “E”s for 1962, as well as her third consecutive Battle Efficiency “E.” During that deployment, &quot;Davis&quot; and her squadron mates &quot;participated in Operation Full Swing, MidLandEx and RegEx 62...commended at varying times for signal bridge work to their fine shooting, from smart seamanship to the spreading of good will ashore. Operations at sea consisted primarily of plane guarding and [ASW] exercises...&quot;

DesRon 12 reassembled at Gibraltar on 19 August 1962 and sailed for home, reaching their home port on 30 August. &quot;Davis&quot; entered a leave and upkeep period, followed by a two-week tender availability and a restricted yard availability at the Boston Naval Shipyard. Tensions with the Soviet Union over their deployment of missiles to Cuba, and the consequent establishment of a quarantine of Cuba, however, cut that period of repairs and alterations from six weeks to five. “All ships worked overtime,” wrote DesRon 12&#x27;s chronicler, &quot;and got to sea in time to participate in the Cuban Contingency Operation.&quot; On 12 November, &quot;Davis&quot; sailed for her station on the quarantine line. While thus deployed, she visited Santo Domingo as part of the American effort to &quot;demonstrate...support for forthcoming free elections in that country.&quot; During her two-day visit to the capital of the Dominican Republic, the ship hosted President Raphael Bonnelly and gave a party for the children at a local orphanage.

Returning to Newport on 29 November 1962, &quot;Davis&quot; put to sea as part of the holiday ready-duty ASW task group, steaming to Bermuda and operating with antisubmarine warfare support carrier over Christmas. Returning to her home port on 29 December, the ship remained there into the following year, in a leave and upkeep status.

On 21 January 1963, Davis, and all (except &quot;Purdy&quot;) of DesRon 12, sailed from Newport for Norfolk, where, along with other units of Task Group Bravo, they attended ASW Tactical School. After conducting ASW evolutions (28 January – 9 February), followed by an upkeep period at Newport, Davis operated with Task Group Bravo as it covered the visit of President John F. Kennedy to Costa Rica in March, remaining with &quot;Wasp&quot; and in company with &quot;Compton&quot; and &quot;Gainard&quot;. Following that assignment, the ship conducted the annual Springboard operations, interspersed with visits to St. Thomas, San Juan and Santo Domingo, ultimately returning to Newport on 3 April.

Following a tender availability, &quot;Davis&quot; got underway on 19 April 1963 for Norfolk for work at the ASW Tactical School, honing her skills for future coordinated ASW operations, for a five-day period that concluded with her return to Newport on 2 May. Soon thereafter, she sailed on 11 May, along with her squadron-mates, &quot;deployed as standby recovery stations&quot; for the Mercury-Atlas 9 space flight of Gordon Cooper. Upon the successful conclusion of that mission, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to Newport.

Subsequently, &quot;Davis&quot; sailed on 4 June 1963 with 26 Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps midshipmen on board, as Task Group Bravo began a six-week cruise, beginning with visiting a succession of Gulf Coast ports, Galveston and Houston, Texas, Mobile, Alabama, Gulfport, Mississippi, Port Arthur, Texas and New Orleans, Louisiana, proceeding thence to La Ceiba and Puerto Cortés, Honduras, Santo Domingo, Curaçao, Montego Bay and Kingston, Jamaica, San Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico.

Davis spent much of August and September 1963 moored at Newport, with the exception of a weapons demonstration for students at the Naval War College (12–16 August), highlighted by a surface-to-air missile shoot by the nuclear-powered guided missile . Following that period, &quot;Davis&quot; and the rest of DesRon 12 got underway for Norfolk on 23 September for a week of evolutions with the ASW Tactical School, followed by ASW operations at sea on 30 September. She carried out further ASW work with her squadron-mates and a target submarine, ultimately returning to Newport on 11 October.

Following participation in a &quot;combined demonstration&quot; for students of the National War College (28 October – 1 November 1963), the ship continued her work as part of Task Group Bravo, first with &quot;Wasp&quot; and then with sistership , work punctuated by a three-day visit to Bermuda in mid-November.

Operating from Newport, &quot;Davis&quot; began the year 1964 with four weeks of ASW exercises with the ships of her squadron, during January and February. Following her regular overhaul (for which she had departed her home port on 27 March) at Boston Naval Shipyard, she carried out refresher training at Guantanamo, along with &quot;Hyman&quot; and &quot;Purdy&quot;. Effective 1 July, DesRon 12 became part of Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla (CruDesFlot) 10. &quot;Davis&quot; operated with the Second Fleet Gold Group in October, and the following month received an annual administrative inspection by Captain Burdick H. Brittin, ComDesRon 12, and his staff. On 27 November, Davis and her consorts sailed for the Mediterranean, and arrived at Gibraltar to join the Sixth Fleet on 8 November. The squadron then visited a succession of ports: Palma de Mallorca, Pollensa Bay, Valencia and Alicante in Spain; Toulon, Cannes and Golfe-Juan in France; and Naples and Livorno in Italy.

Returning from the Mediterranean on 14 March 1965, &quot;Davis&quot; remained in her home port only a relatively short time, for she soon returned to the Caribbean area due to the Dominican Civil War. &quot;Davis&quot;, ComDesRon 12 embarked, departed Newport on 10 June in company with . After fueling from oiler on 13 June, she rendezvoused with and soon thereafter began patrolling off the coast of Santo Domingo. Steaming independently, she fueled from &quot;Sabine&quot; again on 19 June, resuming her patrol upon completion of the underway replenishment. On 26 June, ComDesRon 12 assumed duties as CTF-124. &quot;Davis&quot; fueled from on 30 June, then resumed patrol, sighting Dominican patrol craft on 1 July. She refueled from &quot;Aucilla&quot; a second time, on 6 July, then patrolled in area P-3 on 9 July. ComDesRon 12 shifted his flag to on 10 July, then a little less than three hours later &quot;Davis&quot; departed for San Juan, standing in the next morning. On 15 July, she proceeded to the gunfire range at Culebra to conduct Naval gunfire support practice. Davis fueled from &quot;Essex&quot; en route back to Newport on 19 July, then conducted ASW exercises with TG 83.3 on 20 July, and then participated in gunnery exercises. She fueled from on 21 July; maneuvered again with &quot;Essex&quot; and ultimately arrived back at Newport, mooring on 22 July.

&quot;Davis&quot; departed Newport on 3 January 1966 and reached the Naval Ammunition Depot, Earle, the following day. After taking on a full load of ammunition, she returned to her home port &quot;and continued the myriad preparations for the scheduled deployment to the western Pacific.&quot; A little over a fortnight later, on 19 January, &quot;Davis&quot; sailed for Panama on the first leg of her journey, carrying out drills en route. Transiting the Panama Canal on 25 January, she reached San Diego, California, on 4 February for &quot;limited boiler repair&quot; before continuing on her voyage. Underway the following day, she pushed on for Hawaii. Following a brief stop at Naval Base Pearl Harbor, &quot;Davis&quot;, along with Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 121, reached Naval Base Subic Bay, Philippines, on 28 February (DesDiv 122 proceeded to Kaohsiung, Taiwan).

====Vietnam War (first deployment)====
On 4 March 1966, &quot;Davis&quot; sailed from Subic Bay. Following operations with the attack carrier (4–8 March), she proceeded to the waters of IV Corps, the southern-most military region in South Vietnam to provide gunfire support for South Vietnamese forces and their American advisors (8–14 March). Following that period, she returned to the attack aircraft carrier strike group and alternated between serving as a unit of the protective screen or as plane guard. &quot;Davis&quot; accompanied the attack carriers &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; (15–31 March) and (1–10 April) as they launched daily air strikes against targets in both North and South Vietnam. &quot;The carrier operations were demanding on destroyers,&quot; her chronicler continued, &quot;with launches and recoveries being conducted around the clock.&quot; Entertainers Danny Kaye and Vikki Karr visited the ship, via a Kaman SH-2 Seasprite helicopter, to entertain the crew with comedy and music, during that period.

Davis sailed for Sasebo, Japan, on 10 April 1966, mooring in port three days later alongside the repair ship . Following a fortnight in that city, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to Subic Bay for a brief tender availability alongside . Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet, paid the ship an informal visit to present the ship with the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy for 1965, awarded &quot;for achieving the greatest improvement in battle efficiency during the competitive year&quot; to one ship in the Atlantic and one in the Pacific. Ironically, the high speed transport , the winner of the trophy in the Pacific Fleet, lay moored nearby. Each commanding officer visited the other ship and exchanged plaques.

&quot;Davis&quot; sailed for Hong Kong, arriving on the afternoon of 7 May 1966. Underway once more on 11 May, the destroyer sailed for the coast of South Vietnam and her second gunfire support tour, that time off the shores of I Corps, the northernmost military region. Operating off Quảng Ngãi province, &quot;Davis&quot; fired missions against the Viet Cong (VC), supporting the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)&#x27;s 2nd Division and United States Army Second Advisory Group, providing gunfire support almost daily, and on numerous occasions during the night to assist ARVN troops and their advisors in preventing outposts from being over-run by the VC. &quot;With such effective support,&quot; Davis&#x27;s historian noted, &quot;the 2nd ARVN [Division] outposts were able to maintain their positions along the coastal plain of Quảng Ngãi and to keep [the strategically important] Highway One open.&quot; For over a month, the ship also provided gunfire support for United States Marine Corps (USMC) units in the vicinity of Chu Lai and Da Nang.

Illustrative of the nature of the routine &quot;Davis&quot; often followed, on 24 May 1966 she fired 13 rounds of gunfire support during the afternoon watch, then stationed the special sea and refueling detail at 21:58 as she began maneuvering to go alongside the underway replenishment ship . She received 46,281 gallons of Navy Standard Fuel Oil (NSFO) between 22:23 and 23:12, then took her first load of powder on board as 23:40 and completed the re-ammunitioning (234 rounds of flashless powder) a half hour into the mid watch on 25 May, after which she broke away from the &quot;Sacramento&quot;. She then fired 20 rounds of gunfire support during the forenoon watch before commencing a vertical replenishment (vertrep) from &quot;Sacramento&quot; between 12:54 and 13:38, taking on board 228 rounds of 5”/54 anti-aircraft common projectiles. A little over two hours later, she began firing a gunfire support mission consisting of two rounds, but fired a second during the first watch, commencing at 21:00, firing an illumination round every fifteen minutes for the remainder of the watch. Continuing her operations in the &quot;hostile fire pay zone&quot; on 26 May, she fired a gunfire support mission during the forenoon watch, firing 135 rounds of 5-inch and 42 rounds of 3-inch. She conducted a second mission that day that proved essentially a duplicate of the one the night before; beginning at 21:00, she fired one illumination round every fifteen minutes.

Davis departed the war zone on 10 June 1966 for Kaohsiung and moored alongside destroyer tender for &quot;repairs necessitated by the long period of operations under combat conditions.&quot; The ship sailed on 20 June to return to the waters off I Corps. She continued to respond to calls for gunfire support in a timely manner, and also &quot;found time to respond to an emergency request for blood&quot; from the hospital ship . By the time &quot;Davis&quot; left the firing line, she had expended over 5,000 rounds of 5”/54 and over 1,000 of 3”/50. The ship received a message from the I Corps Naval Gunfire Liaison Officer: &quot;It&#x27;s been a real pleasure working with you and I can say that Davis is the best damned shooting tin can in Uncle Sam&#x27;s Navy and the best one we&#x27;ve worked with in our time here. You&#x27;re a real credit to the Navy.&quot;

Following a third upkeep period at Subic (3–6 July 1966) where DesRon 12 reassembled after their individual deployments parceled out with the Seventh Fleet, &quot;Davis&quot; and her consorts sailed for the U.S. on 6 July. They crossed the equator on 9 July. &quot;Davis&quot; and the ships of DesDiv 121 fueled at Penang, Malaysia (11–12 July) (DesDiv 122 fueled at Port Dickson), the squadron reassembling again on 12 July. They visited Cochin, India (16–18 July), then pushed on for the British Protectorate of Aden, where they fueled &quot;under the watchful eye of a Russian trawler.&quot; Given the Aden Emergency however, the officers and men of DesRon 12 experienced no liberty there.

&quot;Davis&quot; and her squadron mates continued their voyage, &quot;proceeding individually up the Red Sea&quot; to the southern end of the Suez Canal, then transited that waterway (27 July 1966) on the way to Greece. After visiting Pireaus (29 July – 1 August), DesRon 12 split up again, with &quot;Davis&quot; and DesDiv 121 visiting Barcelona (4–7 August), DesDiv 122 calling at Palma de Mallorca. Both divisions got underway on 7 August, paused at Gibraltar for fuel (9 August), then began their crossing of the Atlantic, enjoying a smooth voyage and a &quot;grand&quot; homecoming to Newport on 17 August as “fireboats sprayed streams of water, a light plane towed a welcome home sign, and hundreds of wives and children filled the pier.” Word of the ship&#x27;s being awarded the Battle Efficiency “E” in DesRon 12 crowned &quot;Davis&quot;’s successful circumnavigation of the globe.

&quot;Davis&quot; sailed from her home port on 22 September 1966 for Boston Naval Shipyard, arriving there the following day for &quot;extensive work on her engineering plant,&quot; after which she returned to DesRon 12 for active operations on 26 November. She rounded out the year participating in LantFlEx 66 (28 November – 16 December), then finished the year in holiday leave and upkeep status that lasted into the following year.

Following a period alongside the destroyer tender , &quot;Davis&quot; got underway for a stint of ASW operations on 23 January 1967, upon completion of which she returned to her home port (29 January). Underway again on 13 February, the ship participated in Springboard evolutions that included ASW, antiaircraft and surface gunnery exercises, punctuated by visits to San Juan. Davis carried out surveillance of a Soviet intelligence-gathering trawler on 4 March, then proceeded on to Miami, Florida, arriving there for a brief visit (9–12 March). Returning to Newport on 15 March, she remained in port until her departure for the Mediterranean on 2 May, with the exception of local operations (20–21 March) and a dependents&#x27; cruise (24 April).

====Six-Day War and USS Liberty incident====
&quot;Davis&quot; stood out of the waters off Newport on 2 May 1967, bound for the Mediterranean. She arrived at Gibraltar on 11 May, then sailed two days later to begin operations with TG 60.2 of the Sixth Fleet. Ominously, &quot;about [that] time tension in the Arab-Israeli area became critical,&quot; one observer wrote, &quot;and DesRon 12, along with the other units in the Sixth Fleet went on increased alert status and remained at sea...&quot; The Sixth Fleet received orders to move into the eastern Mediterranean on 23 May, four days after the United Arab Republic (UAR) had ordered the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula. Three days later, as Egypt remilitarized the Sinai and declared a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba off the Israeli port of Eilat, U.S. dependents de-planed in Athens and Rome, having been flown in from Cairo, UAR and Israel, respectively. An increased Soviet naval presence appeared soon thereafter, as the first Soviet warships transited the Dardanelles from the Black Sea and began more aggressive shadowing of U.S. naval movements. On 5 June, in the wake of those increasing tensions, the Six-Day War opened with a dramatic pre-emptive attack by Israel on Egypt and spread to include Jordan and Syria over the next few days.

Rendezvousing with TG 60.1 at 14:32 on 8 June 1967, &quot;Davis&quot; assumed her place in the screen of the attack carriers and &quot;Saratoga&quot;, along with guided missile light cruisers and . At 17:19, however, &quot;Davis&quot; and received verbal orders to proceed at once to the assistance of the technical research ship , that had, earlier that day, been attacked in international waters by Israeli jets and motor torpedo boats, approximately north of the Sinai port of Arish, UAR. &quot;Davis&quot; conducted a brief helicopter transfer &quot;of two people and equipment from USS &quot;America&quot;&quot; between 18:06 and 18:08 and increased speed.

While Liberty steamed slowly away from the coastline, &quot;Davis&quot; (Capt. Harold G. Leahy, ComDesRon 12, embarked) and &quot;Massey&quot; raced to her aid. &quot;Davis&quot; worked up to 30 knots during the first watch on 8 June and maintained that speed during the mid-watch on 9 June 1967. The two destroyers reached the limping &quot;Liberty&quot; during the morning watch on 9 June, finding her listing to starboard, while the plethora of shell and fragment holes topside, the burned and scarred paintwork and the gaping torpedo hole in her hull bore mute testimony to the unbridled ferocity of the attack of the day before.

&quot;Davis&quot; rang down &quot;all stop&quot; at 06:32 on 9 June 1967 and lay-to, launching her motor Whaleboat; the boat then made runs between &quot;Davis&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot;, transferring medical and damage control parties. &quot;Massey&quot; contributed a corpsman to help treat the wounded. &quot;Davis&quot; moored alongside &quot;Liberty&quot; between 07:25 and 09:42 to continue the process, transferred men then cleared the side while helicopters evacuated the seriously wounded, and the bodies of the slain, to &quot;America&quot;, which, along with &quot;Little Rock&quot;, arrived shortly thereafter. The cruiser transferred her damage control assistant, in addition to two corpsmen, to &quot;Liberty&quot;, and took on board some of the less seriously wounded men. Later, after &quot;Davis&quot; had transferred two photographers to the ship by helicopter at 14:02, Davis&#x27;s main propulsion assistant, was transferred to the &quot;Liberty&quot; by helicopter at 16:06.

Davis&#x27;s 20-man team played important roles in righting the ship, aided by the unwounded or less seriously injured &quot;Liberty&quot; crewmen, raising steam and getting the badly damaged vessel underway for Malta, accompanied by the fleet tug , whose presence freed &quot;Massey&quot; to return to the fleet. During the passage to Valetta, &quot;Davis&quot;s and &quot;Liberty&quot;s sailors gradually restored &quot;most of the ship&#x27;s vital systems, including the main gyro, sound-powered phone circuits, and a main fire and flushing pump.&quot; Ultimately, &quot;Liberty&quot;, convoyed by &quot;Davis&quot; and &quot;Papago&quot;, stood in to Valetta harbor during the morning watch on 14 June 1967. Seventeen &quot;Davis&quot; crewmen received commendations for their work in aiding the &quot;Liberty.&quot;

&quot;Davis&quot; departed Malta on 19 June 1967 to conduct ASW operations, then stood in to Souda Bay, Crete, on 23 June for a brief period of upkeep alongside destroyer tender . While at Souda Bay, she embarked several midshipmen for summer training. Putting in to Civitavecchia, Italy, on 7 July, she returned to sea ten days later to continue her routine of drills and operations. Then, following visits to Porto Contini, Sardinia, Golfe-Juan, France and Ibiza, Spain, interludes interspersed with operations at sea, &quot;Davis&quot; picked up a sonar contact on 24 August and evaluated it as a Soviet submarine. Destroyer joined &quot;Davis&quot; in prosecuting the contact, that attempted, unsuccessfully, to evade the Americans. The submarine crept eastward at speeds varying from one to three knots. Destroyers &quot;Massey&quot; and and escort ships and , joined to assist, while the anti-submarine controllers on board &quot;Davis&quot; and &quot;Fred T. Berry&quot; conducted over 1,200 Magnetic Anomaly Detection verification runs on the submarine, utilizing aircraft from &quot;Essex&quot;. &quot;Finally,&quot; wrote &quot;Fred T. Berry&quot;s historian, &quot;after 105 hours of being bombarded by the sonars of &quot;[Fred T.] Berry&quot; and &quot;Davis&quot;, a Soviet Foxtrot-class submarine (F.966) &quot;surfaced to the delight of the entire Sixth Fleet&quot; (30 August). After calling at Palma de Mallorca (30 August – 5 September 1967), &quot;Davis&quot; got underway for the last ASW operations in the deployment to the Mediterranean on 5 September, upon completion of which she put in to Rota for turnover procedures, on 10 September. Two days later, she sailed for home, and reached Newport on 21 September.

Following a period of local operations out of her home port, &quot;Davis&quot; dropped down the coast to Norfolk, where she &quot;received personnel from school&quot; (22 October 1967), conducted further work at sea, then returned to Norfolk, where she remained until 1 November. Returning to Newport, the ship prepared for her next stint of operations at sea, and during that time served as the venue (3 November) for the ceremony in which Captain Leahy received the Navy Commendation Medal for his leadership in the evolutions that led to the 105-hour hold-down, and consequent surfacing, of the Soviet &quot;Foxtrot&quot; class submarine in August 1967. &quot;Davis&quot; then operated with the Royal Canadian Navy in a joint ASW exercise, Operation CanUS SilEx, from 6 November, then visited Halifax, Nova Scotia (17–20 November). Returning to Newport on 22 November, Davis prepared for a yard period at Boston to receive an interim overhaul of boiler superheaters, economizers, and other portions of the engineering plant.

Ready for sea by early February 1968, &quot;Davis&quot; underwent dock trials on 6 February, then got underway on 8 February. Transiting the Cape Cod Canal on 10 February, the ship paused only briefly at her home port, for she sailed on 13 February, headed for the Caribbean in company with &quot;Massey&quot; and &quot;Stickell&quot; to participate in Operation Springboard. A slate of ASW and AAW exercises, shore bombardment drills off Culebra and a &quot;tough and exacting Operational Readiness Inspection&quot; then followed, punctuated by four visits to San Juan and one to St. Thomas for recreation. Upon completion of Springboard evolutions, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to Mayport on 8 March 1968 for a three-week stay. Underway again on 30 March, the ship then departed for a stint of &quot;special operations.&quot; Classified briefings at Key West followed, on 2 April, describing her duties.

Over the next three weeks, punctuated only by three one-day visits to Key West, &quot;Davis&quot;, as Commander TG 138.2, provided support for as she operated in the Florida Straits. Davis operated at round-the-clock Condition III watches, the destroyer on occasion scrutinized by Soviet-built Komar-class missile boats out of Havana, as she essentially rode shotgun for &quot;Sgt. Joseph E. Muller&quot; as the auxiliary vessel carried out her &quot;research.&quot; Relieved on 22 April, the destroyer returned to Newport for a brief visit (25–29 April).

Together with &quot;Stickell&quot; and the escort ship , Davis participated in ASW exercises as part of TG 83.1, formed around &quot;Wasp&quot;. Liberty at Bermuda punctuated the &quot;hectic&quot; training and the &quot;long hours,&quot; after which another week of ASW evolutions ensued. She returned to her home port on 22 May 1968.

Soon thereafter, on 1 July 1968, &quot;Davis&quot; was reassigned from DesRon 12 to DesRon 20, again designated as flagship. That same month, she conducted short cruises off the Virginia capes, carrying out a busy slate of AAW, ASW, and surface gunnery work, in addition to basic seamanship. Sailing on 22 August in company with , Davis put in to Norfolk on 23 August, and there embarked Captain Robert E. Williams, ComDesRon 36, as the ship was assigned temporarily to DesRon 36 for the impending WestPac deployment. She sailed for Panama the same day.

Transiting the Panama Canal on 28 August 1968, Davis got underway for Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 1 September. Remaining there for five days (5–10 September), the ship paused at Pearl Harbor (15–18 September), Midway Atoll (21 September) and Guam (28 September). After transiting San Bernardino Strait, Davis arrived at Subic Bay on 2 October for a final period of shipyard work before she would report to the war zone. Underway on 8 October, Davis arrived on station two days later.

====Vietnam War second deployment====
During her first gunline tour of that deployment, &quot;Davis&quot;, ComDesRon 36 and his staff receiving gunfire support briefings at Da Mang and Dong Ha Combat Base on 10 October 1968, operated off the northern coast of South Vietnam, just below the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). She supported the 1st Air Cavalry Division from 10–14 October, and the 3rd Marine Division from 14–29 October. During the second stint, &quot;Davis&quot;, with ComDesRon 36 as Gunline Commander, Commander, Task Unit (CTU) 70.8.9, began softening up the territory south of Ben Hao, along the DMZ, for a joint 3rd Marine Division-ARVN operation. &quot;Davis&quot; took some 70 targets under fire, including 24 &quot;active artillery sites,&quot; killing 112 enemy troops and destroying over 30 bunkers and structures; 3rd Marine Division observers considered the operations on 23–24 October successful, &quot;due primarily to the excellent preparation and call for fire by naval guns prior to and during the sweeps.&quot;

Such operations, however, proved not at all one-sided as the shoot-out at high noon on 26 October 1968 proved. People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam guns opened up from Hòn Gió island (Tiger island), while &quot;Davis&quot; stood off the DMZ awaiting a gunfire support assignment, pumping out 25–30 rounds in ten minutes, bracketing the ship with the first two rounds and putting the third one close astern, spraying fragments on the destroyer&#x27;s stern but hurting no one. &quot;Davis&quot;s guns spoke in reply, and some 160 rounds silenced the PAVN battery. On the night of 28–29 October, three more &quot;enemy-initiated incidents&quot; resulted in some 22 rounds of &quot;hostile fire&quot; being fired in &quot;Davis&quot;s direction, all from the vicinity of Cape Lay, with the destroyer responding in kind each time. She received hostile fire again on 1 November, as she continued support of the 3rd Marine Division, but emerged unscathed from the encounter once more, and provided call fire for the Marines between 8–13 November, before she departed the gunline for Sasebo, Japan, on 16 November, ending her first line deployment.

After visiting Sasebo (22 November – 1 December 1968), &quot;Davis&quot; visited Busan, South Korea (2–5 December) and Hong Kong (8–14 December) before she returned to the gun line on 16 December, reporting &quot;on station and ready to fire&quot; in the waters off I Corps. The next day, she began gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division, and on the 18th fired in support of Operation Victory Dragon VI; she continued support of the 1st Marine Division until 21 December, then shifted back to Victory Dragon VI (21–24 December). Firing no missions on Christmas Day, she resumed the next day, firing once more in support of Victory Dragon VI; she rounded out the month (27–31 December) in support of Operation Valiant Hunt, an amphibious landing south of Danang.

At the beginning of January 1969, &quot;Davis&quot;s principal missions during the concluding portion of Valiant Hunt (1–5 January 1969) involved harassment, suppressing sniper fire, causing one secondary explosion and destroying three enemy outposts, it had also evidently inflicted heavy casualties, as the Marines discovered mass graves in the area. When questioned, the local populace attributed the 20–30 dead VC buried en masse to the ship&#x27;s harassing fire.

With Captain Murphy&#x27;s relief as CTU 70.8.1 by ComDesRon 5 on 6 January 1969 upon the conclusion of Valiant Hunt, Davis conducted a succession of rest and recreation visits, to Kaohsiung; Cebu, Philippines; and Subic Bay. The destroyer departed the latter place on 26 January to return to the gun line. During the last three days of January, &quot;Davis&quot; provided gunfire support for the 27th Marine Regiment and the Republic of Korea (ROK) 2nd Marine Brigade in Quảng Nam province, &quot;the destroyer&#x27;s 5&quot;/54 projectiles [accounting] for four enemy KIA, five more probably killed, 28 structures or bunkers destroyed, 18 damaged, two secondary explosions and three secondary fires.&quot; &quot;Davis&quot; continued her gunfire support duties until 15 February, after which time she returned to Subic (16 February) to prepare for the voyage back to the United States.

On 18 February 1969, DesRon 36 sailed for home, &quot;Davis&quot;, accompanied by , and &quot;Hugh Purvis&quot;. The squadron visited Sydney, Australia (1–3 March), Wellington, New Zealand (8–10 March), Pago Pago, American Samoa (16 March) and Pearl Harbor, where ComDesRon 36 shifted his broad pennant from &quot;Davis&quot; to &quot;DuPont&quot; on 22 March. Transiting the Panama Canal on 6 April, &quot;Davis&quot; reached Newport soon thereafter. Over the next five months, the ship operated between Newport and the Caribbean, participating in exercises, and &quot;special operations&quot; in the latter region. She departed her home port on 17 October and entered Boston Naval Shipyard soon thereafter, where she was decommissioned during the forenoon watch on 30 October 1969.

===1970s===
Recommissioned at her conversion yard on 17 October 1970 and with Commander Davis&#x27;s widow and son in attendance at the invitation of the crew, &quot;Davis&quot; remained at Boston, completing her fitting-out, then conducted her Board of Inspection and Survey (InSurv) trials in the Boston Operating Areas on 26 October, putting back into the yard the following day. Moved to the South Boston Naval Shipyard Annex, cold-iron, on 2 December, she shifted to the operational control of Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, as a unit of Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 10 and DesRon 12 two days later.

Rejoining the fleet, &quot;Davis&quot; conducted tests of her sensors and weapons systems on the Fleet Operational Readiness Accuracy Checks (FORACS) range off Cape Cod (7–8 December 1970) then proceeded, via the Cape Cod Canal and Buzzards Bay, to Earle, to load ammunition (9 December). During the two-day evolution, however, the ship&#x27;s inspectors rejected over 200 projectiles (&quot;improper gas check seals&quot;), a rejection that would, in time, lead to the Bureau of Ordnance&#x27;s re-evaluating its inspection procedures and providing better ammunition service to the Fleet. She then returned to her home port, after an absence of more than a year, on 11 December.

Shifted from DesRon 12 to DesRon 20 on New Year&#x27;s Day 1971. &quot;Davis&quot; sailed for Guantanamo on 12 January 1971, then conducted various training evolutions off the Virginia capes, including a surface gunnery shoot with fleet tug &quot;Papago&quot; towing the target. After taking on supplies, fuel, and stores at Norfolk Naval Base (19–21 January), the ship got underway for Port Everglades, where she conducted &quot;pre-weapon system accuracy test alignment and calibration checks. From Port Everglades, &quot;Davis&quot; proceeded to the Tongue of the Ocean, off Andros, Bahamas, where she underwent &quot;acoustic sensor and ASW weapons system testing on the AUTEC range (27–30 January), firing her first ASROC test missile on 29 January as well as several tube-launched weapons. A &quot;minor engineering casualty&quot; and the ensuing wait for parts to enable her to make the necessary repairs at Port Everglades (31 January – 2 February) delayed the ship&#x27;s proceeding to Guantanamo Bay.

Arriving at her destination on 6 February 1971, &quot;Davis&quot; began her post-overhaul shakedown five days later, conducting drills that range from low visibility piloting, general quarters, air tracking and submarine tracking with . Less than a week after embarking upon her shakedown, &quot;Davis&quot; received orders to conduct surveillance off the Cuban port of Cienfuegos. After she took on fuel on the evening of 16 February, she sailed under orders of Commander, ASW Forces, Atlantic (ComASWForLant) and arrived off her destination, effecting a rendezvous with destroyer and radar picket escort ship the following evening, the three ships setting up a &quot;barrier patrol...to observe all shipping.&quot; During Davis&#x27;s watch, no ships entered or exited the harbor without being positively identified. Destroyer relieved her on 19 February.

Following further shakedown training, &quot;Davis&quot; visited Ocho Rios, Jamaica (5–7 March 1971), successfully conducted a mid-term battle problem (11 March), then operated as assist ship for as the escort ship carried out a test of &quot;convergent zone techniques,&quot; using her AN/SQS-26 sonar, working with submarine (18–19 March) as her target, before resuming her shakedown. Only moments after getting underway for the day&#x27;s evolutions on 26 March, however, &quot;Davis&quot; received orders to return to the pier and refuel. Returning to Cienfuegos for a second surveillance operation under ComASWForLant, the destroyer took up a station to seaward of &quot;Calcaterra&quot; and resumed a patrol off the entrance to the harbor, identifying shipping standing in or out of Cienfuegos as before. On 31 March, she returned to Guantanamo.

Setting the sea and anchor detail and sailing for Newport on 7 April 1971, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to her home port on 10 April. Fueling on 5 May, the ship stood out for European waters two days later, stopping at Bermuda (9–10 May). Steaming thence to Ponta Delgada, Azores (14 May), &quot;Davis&quot; steamed to Terceria, Azores, making the first visit by an American warship in 25 years,&quot; and hosted the Naval Commander, Azores, and the U.S. Consul, the ship&#x27;s visit highlighting Armed Forces Day observances. At the start of the mid watch, Davis sailed for the Netherlands.

After passage through the English Channel, Davis reached Amsterdam (19–24 May 1971), then visited Hamburg, West Germany (25–28 May) and Copenhagen, Denmark, where she arrived on 29 May. Departing that Danish port four days later, she received a message &quot;implying that the trip home might not follow the same route as the journey to Northern Europe...&quot; As had occurred earlier in the year off Cuba, Davis received the call to embark upon &quot;special operations.&quot; Her mission, to &quot;locate, photograph and gain all possible visual, acoustical and electronic intelligence&quot; on a new Soviet guided missile destroyer (known only as DDGM 500) steaming in company with the oiler &quot;Boris Chiliken&quot;. Armed with only sketchy information at the outset, &quot;Davis&quot; utilized some &quot;educated guesswork and... alert ESM operators&quot; to pick up the Soviet ships late at night on 3 June 1971. &quot;Dawn [of 4 June] confirmed the identity of the two vessels&quot; and the destroyer became their shadow as they transited the English Channel.

Breaking off the surveillance effort during the forenoon watch on 5 June 1971, &quot;Davis&quot; fueled at Ponta Delgada (8 June) and Bermuda (12 June) and reached her home port on 14 June. Underway for the ammunition anchorage off Prudence Island, she off-loaded all ammunition prior to going into the yard for her post-shakedown availability. Standing out of her home port on 25 June, she returned to Boston on 1 July to wrap up her ASW modernization, yard workers toiling on projects that ranged from major boiler work to the installation of variable depth sonar (VDS) and AN/WSA-1C and a secure voice system, as well as modifications that would allow the ship to have a vertical replenishment capability. Returning to Newport on 4 October 1971 upon conclusion of the yard work at Boston, &quot;Davis&quot; on-loaded ammunition at Prudence Island on 6 October, and a little over a week later, put out into Narragansett Bay on 14 October for another test of the recently installed VDS, but gyro problems within the system precluded a successful test. The ship showed her versatility and adaptability, however, by standing in for another ship to participate in the U.S. Naval Destroyer School cruise, serving as a venue for training prospective engineering officers, in company with guided missile destroyer and destroyer .

Beginning on 1 November 1971, &quot;Davis&quot;, again in company with &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; and &quot;Fiske&quot;, got underway for the operations and weapons portions of the underway curricula, conducting maneuvering drills, gunfire support training, surface target shoots, antiaircraft shoots and navigation training, as well as ASW exercises with submarine , a replenishment drill with the underway replenishment oiler , general quarters drills, and &quot;practical instruction in every facet of the jobs of prospective Destroyer Operations and Weapons Department Heads.&quot; The trio of ships punctuated that training regimen with a visit to Halifax, Nova Scotia, beginning on 5 November. Returning to Narragansett Bay on 12 November, Davis provided her embarked students with ship-handling experience, mooring to a buoy or going alongside a pier, thus concluding her Destroyer School work.

Less than a week later, on 17 November 1971, the ship got underway once more for the Narragansett Bay operating areas, and conducted another VDS sea trial, finally accepting the installation as complete, as well as taking a group of officer candidates to sea. As the month of December came, a Nuclear Weapons Assistance Team visited the ship, and &quot;Davis&quot; participated in Exercise Snowtime 72-3. She also hosted an open house for dependents and friends and gave an early (11 December) Christmas party for the children of Davis&#x27;s crewmen.

Underway on 4 January 1972 for Cuban waters, &quot;Davis&quot; visited New Orleans (8–11 January) en route. Arriving at Guantanamo on 14 January, however, she hastily refueled and stood out, returning to sea for another stint of &quot;special operations,&quot; occasioned by the report by the small Panamanian-flag motorship &quot;Johnny Express&quot; that she had been fired upon off the eastern tip of Cuba in mid-December 1971, and that a Cuban gunboat had attempted a boarding. Consequently, Davis received &quot;Express Tasking&quot; - escort duties and patrol of the Windward Passage and &quot;Northern Choke Point&quot; areas. She escorted the merchantman &quot;Omar Express&quot; to Port au Prince, Haiti, without incident (16–17 January), then, relieved on station by destroyer &quot;Basilone&quot; on 19 January, returned to Guantanamo. After refueling, &quot;Davis&quot; effected a rendezvous with the Bahamas Line motorship &quot;Lincoln Express&quot; and convoyed her safely to the Caicos Passage. Returning to Guantanamo on 21 January, &quot;Davis&quot; completed her refresher training in subsequent days, including NGFS training at Culebra.

&quot;Davis&quot; returned to Newport on 4 February 1972, then got underway to conduct type training off the Virginia capes in company with the guided missile escort ship and participated in ComPTuEx 72-8. Pausing from her training long enough to visit New York City (17–19 March), &quot;Davis&quot;, with ComDesRon 20 embarked, conducted more type training, including towing drills, and carried out extensive ASW exercises with submarine (20–25 March). Returning to her home port on 25 March, the ship underwent tender repairs alongside &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, as well as prepare for LantReadEx 4-72 prior to her slated deployment to the Mediterranean. Underway on 28 April, Davis, along with other Newport-based ships, participated in LantReadEx 4-7, then put back into her home port on 10 May after a rough passage &quot;with high winds and heavy seas being the rule,&quot; and continued preparations for sailing for the Mediterrnanean. Soon thereafter, however, DesRon 20 received word that it was not to join the Sixth Fleet, but the Seventh. &quot;Due to the short notice,&quot; DesRon 20&#x27;s historian noted, &quot;hasty WESTPAC [Western Pacific] preparations had to be made: publications had to be obtained; OPORDERS had to be modified; RPS [Registered Publications System] materials had to be drawn; new transit tracks had to be worked out.&quot;

====Vietnam War third deployment====
Davis and guided missile frigate departed Newport on 4 June 1972, rendezvoused with &quot;America&quot; off Cape Henry, Virginia, and set course for the Philippines; six days later, Admital Elmo Zumwalt, the Chief of Naval Operations, sent a message to the Vietnam-bound ships. &quot;The intensified aggression by the North Vietnamese has required expeditious augmentation of Yankee Station forces to protect U.S. lives in SVN [South Vietnam]. The enemy has increased the level of hostilities and has embarked on a campaign designed to disrupt Vietnamization efforts. It is our job to hold the line. The following weeks will require the fullest of your professional competence. Many teammates are in position and await your arrival.&quot;

Joined on 15 June 1972 by the oiler , slated to provide &quot;refueling services until it was certain that the ships had sufficient fuel to [enable them to] arrive in Subic Bay with a 30 per cent reserve,&quot; the ships rounded the Cape of Good Hope on the &quot;first day of the South African winter, but the cloudy skies and blustery seas,&quot; wrote Dewey&#x27;s historian, &quot;did not prevent &quot;America&quot;s COD [Carrier On-board Delivery] aircraft from flying several tons of much-awaited mail from Cape Town out to the ships...&quot; On the same day &quot;Waccamaw&quot; was detached (26 June), the ships &quot;chopped&quot; to the Seventh Fleet. Consequently, &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Dewey&quot; and &quot;Davis&quot; reached the Philippines on 6 July 1972, &quot;completing a 13,000 mile transit remarkable for the degree of cooperation and coordination among the ships involved...&quot; Upon her arrival at Subic, Davis received .50-caliber machine guns, Redeye missiles and filled her magazines (4-8 July), then sailed for her first gunline deployment in the waters off Quảng Trị province, South Vietnam.

While &quot;gunfire support, rearming and refueling&quot; characterized the routine of a destroyer off the coast of Vietnam, rescue operations broke the routine. On 19 July 1972, 37-millimeter antiaircraft fire hit an F-4D Phantom II of the 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron, during a mission to destroy PAVN bunkers near the DMZ, forcing both crewmen to eject. &quot;Davis&quot; and proceeded to the scene and rescued one crewman each.

Detached from the gunline on 23 July 1972, &quot;Davis&quot; stood to the south, proceeding to Military Region II, where, as part of TU 70.8.2, she provided gunfire support for ARVN troops near Bồng Sơn. She served as flagship for the task unit from 30 July to 1 August. On 10 August, an in-bore explosion tore off two feet of the barrel of gun mount 51, injuring four men; fragments penetrated the deck in several places, prompting &quot;Davis&quot;s detachment from TU 70.8.2. Proceeding to Subic, the ship received a low-pressure modification to mount 51 (13–25 August) that slowed the firing rate from 40 to 20 rounds per minute, but increased its reliability. While in port, however, the ship&#x27;s sounding and security patrol found water in compartment 3-44-4-E. After the de-watering process, investigation revealed a defective fire plug; damage to the sonar equipment resulted in its being left behind for repairs when Davis returned to the gunline on 25 August.

After transporting ComDesRon 20 out to the destroyer on 27 August 1972, &quot;Davis&quot; relieved &quot;Eversole&quot; on that date as plane guard for the attack carrier . Returning to the gunline on 1 September, &quot;Davis&quot; joined other units of TU 75.9.1 in evading a passing typhoon, returning to the gunline soon thereafter (4–11 September). &quot;Chopping&quot; to TU 77.1.2 to participate in Operation Linebacker, &quot;Davis&quot; pounded targets along the coast of North Vietnam over ensuing days, taking hostile fire upon occasion, the closest rounds splashing from the ship. Following an unsuccessful search and rescue (SAR) attempt (14–18 September), &quot;Davis&quot; operated on the gunline (19 September), then resumed Linebacker operations on 19 September. A second SAR operation proved more successful three days later, when a helicopter reached the downed airman when &quot;Davis&quot; was within a few miles of him.

Detached from Linebacker on 26 September 1972, &quot;Davis&quot; proceeded to Sasebo via Subic, and underwent a restricted availability (RAV) in that port (1–9 October) while dependents flew in to visit men serving in the ship. She resumed Linebacker raids as a unit of TU 77.1.1 on 12 October, carrying out nightly shelling and maintaining surveillance of merchantmen from the People&#x27;s Republic of China lying off Hon La and standing ready to prevent any cargoes from reaching the beach. On 15 October, &quot;Davis&quot; conducted the first of several operations wherein she launched air-filled plastic bags that contained &quot;mini-radios&quot; that &quot;when winds and tides permitted, floated ashore to enable the North Vietnamese people to hear non-Communist radio programming.

With ComDesRon 20 embarked, &quot;Davis&quot; became the flagship of TU 77.1.1 on 17 October 1972, and in that capacity she conducted her final strike mission of the deployment, when, on 21 October, she shelled North Vietnamese railroad sidings, highway bridges and coastal defense sites in company with guided missile light cruiser , the guided missile destroyer and destroyer , south of Thanh Hóa. While &quot;James E. Kyes&quot; and &quot;Hoel&quot; provided suppressing fire, &quot;Davis&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot; closed to within of the beach, pounding four primary targets. Coastal defense guns located on Hon Me took the cruiser and destroyer under fire but hit neither ship. &quot;Davis&quot;, taking station astern of &quot;Providence&quot; during the retirement phase, shelled the offending batteries for 15 continuous minutes, counting 31 secondary explosions and encountering no more firing from the guns.

Relieved of Linebacker duties, &quot;Davis&quot; rendezvoused with escort ship and the latter&#x27;s LAMPS helicopter spotted for the two ships&#x27; bombardment of North Vietnamese batteries on Hon Gio, &quot;Davis&quot; firing the last of the 8,315 rounds of 5&quot;/54 of the deployment. The ships then proceeded to Hong Kong for two days of rest and recreation. After outchopping at Subic (29–31 October), &quot;Davis&quot;, with Capt. Claiborne S. Bradley, ComDesRon 20, embarked, then visited Singapore in company with &quot;Dewey&quot; and &quot;Joseph Hewes&quot;, the trio becoming TU 27.8.4 for the homeward voyage.

====Post Vietnam====
Dropping anchor at Sitra, Bahrain, on 15 November 1972, &quot;Davis&quot; and her consorts then took part in Midlink XV, an exercise with U.S., British, Iranian and Pakistani naval forces, then enjoyed liberty at Bandar Abbas, Iran (18–20 November). Detached from Midlink XV, the task unit refueled from the British RFA Plumleaf A78 on 25 November. Crossing the Equator later that same day, Davis spent the night at Mombasa, Kenya (26 November). En route to Recife, Brazil, RFA Tidereach A96 accompanied TU 27.8.4 (29 November – 5 December), as did the anti-submarine frigate (4–5 December). After visiting Recife (10–12 December), Davis arrived at Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 16 December, then got underway to proceed independently for Roosevelt Roads the next day. Preceded by more than 36 of her crew who obtained &quot;earlybird&quot; flights to the U.S., &quot;Davis&quot; departed Roosevelt Roads on 19 December 1972, rendezvoused with TU 27.8.4 on 20 December, then steamed into Newport on the morning of 22 December to begin a post-deployment stand-down period and upkeep that lasted through the end of the winter.

&quot;Davis&quot; departed Newport on 26 March 1973, and reached Charleston, South Carolina, on 2 April. Returning to her home port on 3 July, she sailed on 4 August for Guantanamo Bay, arriving there four days later. Operating out of Guantanamo, &quot;Davis&quot; shifted to Roosevelt Roads, making port on 20 August, then headed north, pausing at Earle (23 August) before continuing her return voyage to Newport, arriving there on 24 August. Dropping down to Earle, arriving on 20 September, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to Newport on 22 October, then sailed soon thereafter for Norfolk, arriving the following day. She returned to her home port on 3 November, then conducted operations at sea before returning to Earle on 12 December, returning thence to Newport, arriving on 13 December and remaining in port through the end of the year 1973.

Underway on 4 January 1974, &quot;Davis&quot; formally joined the Sixth Fleet ten days later at Rota (14 January), then sailed, with ComDesRon 24 embarked, on 16 January in company with escort ships and , passing through the Strait of Gibraltar and entering the Mediterranean. She then visited a succession of ports: Saint-Tropez, France (19–21 January), Sanremo, Italy (25–31 January) and Valencia, Spain (1–4 February), cutting short the latter visit to get underway on eight-hour notice to carry out &quot;special operations&quot; in the Gulf of Hammamat (5–7 February). After visits to the Sicilian ports of Augusta (8–9 February) and Taormina (9–13 February), &quot;Davis&quot; then participated in International Week exercises (13–24 February). Another succession of port visits ensued, to the Italian ports of Rapallo (24 February – 2 March) and Naples (4–18 March), where she received a tender availability alongside , Corfu, Greece (19–24 March) and Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia (25–29 March).

Departing Dubrovnik on 29 March 1974, &quot;Davis&quot; rendezvoused with Amphibious Task Force 503 and took part in Dark Image, an amphibious assault exercise in the Adriatic complete with naval gunfire support drills. Upon the conclusion of Dark Image, Davis returned to Valencia (9–22 April), then called at Port Mahon, Minorca (23–27 April), before she took part in exercise Dawn Patrol (27 April – 5 May). Following a visit to Rhodes (9–12 May) bookended by time spent at Athens (5–8 May and 13–19 May), the ship carried out a period of underway operations, testing her sonar (19–25 May). After anchoring off Milos, Greece (25–29 March), &quot;Davis&quot; visited Iraklion (29 May – 3 June) and Souda Bay (3–6 June), Crete. After participating in another International Week exercise (6–8 June), she returned to Souda Bay (8–9 June), then the Greek locales of Mykonos (10–13 June) and Elefsis (14–16 June). &quot;Davis&quot; wound up her cruise with participation in exercise Flaming Lance (19–23 June) before putting in to Rota (23–24 June) for turnover with her relief.

&quot;Davis&quot; returned to Newport, her home since she first joined the fleet, on 3 July 1974, but lingered only a short time (3–9 July), for her home port, along with the other units of DesRon 20, to Charleston, South Carolina. On 11 July, she arrived at her new base. She operated thence through mid-December, carrying out two successive periods of underway operations (9–13 September and 1–4 October) followed by participation in ComPTUEx 3-75 (21–26 October). Following an InSurv inspection (4–7 November), &quot;Davis&quot; conducted one more period of underway operations for 1974 (9–12 December), then visited Port Everglades (12–14 December). Offloading weapons at the Naval Weapons Station, Charleston (17–18 December), Davis entered Charleston Naval Shipyard on 19 December 1974, where she remained for the next year, undergoing a regular overhaul that concluded on 19 December 1975.

Underway on 28 January 1976, the ship proceeded to Guantanamo Bay, whence she conducted refresher training (12 February – 11 March), after which time she underwent a SMORE inspection (22–26 March), then a tender availability (27 March – 23 April) at Charleston. Following sea trials (24 April), &quot;Davis&quot; underwent her nuclear weapons inspection (3–4 May), then a series of Operational Propulsion Plan Examination (OPPE) evolutions (13–14 May, 19–21 May and 27–28 May), before she carried out preparations for her next deployment (29 May – 30 June).

&quot;Davis&quot;, with ComDesRon 14 staff and a VC-6 drone detachment embarked, stood out of Charleston on 10 July 1976, and proceeded south in company with guided missile frigate and frigate . Over the next four months, &quot;Davis&quot; and her consorts participated in UNITAS XVII, operating with units of the Brazilian, Uruguayan and Argentine navies, and visiting Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Montevideo, Uruguay and Recife, Brazil. Arriving at Punta Arenas, Chile, on 14 September, Davis transited the Strait of Magellan, then exercised with ships of the Chilean, Peruvian, Colombian and Venezuelan navies, and visited Valparaiso, Chile, Lima, Peru, Cartagena, Colombia and Caracas, Venezuela. On 23 November, the ship returned to her home port, then entered a tender availability period on 10 December, alongside .

Wrapping up her availability alongside &quot;Sierra&quot; on 14 January 1977, &quot;Davis&quot; got underway on 17 January to participate in CaribREx 1-77. Earning the &quot;Top Gun&quot; award for surface, antiaircraft and naval gunfire support shooting, as well as the &quot;Top Hunter&quot; kudos for her ASW work, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to her home port for largely concurrent restricted (23 February – 20 May) and tender (23 February – 5 April) availabilities, the latter again alongside &quot;Sierra&quot;. Following a naval technical proficiency inspection (NTPI) (3–4 May), the ship underwent another period of tender repairs, alongside (25 May – 15 June), a part of which overlapped her restricted availability (3 June – 20 October) at her home port, at the conclusion of which she sailed for Africa.

Operating under ComDesRon 14, &quot;Davis&quot; visited Conakry, Guinea (1–2 November 1977) and Lagos, Nigeria (7–9 November), fueled at Dakar, Senegal (14 November) before she proceeded to Rota (19–20 November). Fueling at Cagliari, Sicily (23 November), then from on 25 November, the destroyer stood in to Port Said on the 26th and transited the Suez Canal the next day. Visited Aqaba, Jordan, where she relieved guided missile destroyer (28 November) and became a part of the Middle East Force (MidEastFor). Following fuel stops at Djibouti (5 and 8 December), the ship then visited Hodeida, Yemen, a purely &quot;diplomatic&quot; call with no liberty for the crew (10–12 December). After a third stop at Djibouti for fuel (14 December), &quot;Davis&quot; crossed the Equator on 17 December, then continued on for Mombasa, arriving on 20 December to begin a visit that would last a little over a fortnight.

Sailing for Mombasa on 5 January 1978 with Rear Admiral Samuel H. Packer, ComMidEastFor, embarked, Davis steamed in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, into late February, punctuating those periods underway with weekly fuel stops at Djibouti and a visit to Muscat, Oman (25–28 January). After a period of upkeep at Bahrain, the ship conducted turnover with her reliefs, guided missile destroyer and frigate , at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (9 April). Transiting the Suez Canal on 13 April, &quot;Davis&quot; reached Rota on 20 April and began her transatlantic passage. Fueling in the Azores (23 April), the destroyer visited Hamilton, Bermuda (28–29 April), and stood up the Cooper River on 2 May.

&quot;Davis&quot; remained at Charleston into the summer of 1978, logging an NWAT assist visit (14–16 June) and a TSI/NTPI inspection (19–20 June). She embarked midshipmen for training (18 July – 18 August) that extended into the ship&#x27;s cruise to the Great Lakes. Departing Charleston on 3 August in company with destroyers (Captain William D. Daniels, ComDesRon 34, Naval Reserve Force, embarked) and , &quot;Davis&quot; visited a succession of ports, acquainting residents with the U.S. Navy and aiding in recruiting efforts in that region. In company with &quot;William C. Lawe&quot; and &quot;Robert A. Owens&quot;, she visited Quebec (8–10 August) and Montreal (10–11 August), Canada; and the New York ports of Ogdensburg (12–14 August), Oswego (14–16 August) and Buffalo (17–20 August). &quot;Davis&quot; then called at Ashtabula, Ohio (20–24 August), rejoining &quot;William C. Lawe&quot; and &quot;Robert A. Owens&quot; for a visit to Toledo, Ohio (24–28 August). The three ships then visited Detroit, Michigan (28 August – 1 September) and Cleveland, Ohio, arriving on 1 September. &quot;Robert A. Owens&quot; departed that port on 5 September, &quot;Davis&quot; and &quot;William C. Lawe&quot; the next morning. The task unit reassembled at Buffalo on 6 September, where Captain Billy B. Traweek relieved Captain Daniels as ComDesRon 34 NRF. Resuming the Great Lakes cruise, the destroyers visited Toronto, Canada (7–9 September); &quot;Davis&quot; stopped at Oswego for a CHT pump-out while the other two ships proceeded to Ogdensburg for the same purpose. After another pause at Montreal, the ships steamed up the Saint Lawrence Seaway. While &quot;William C. Lawe&quot; and &quot;Robert A. Owens&quot; paused at Halifax, Nova Scotia, &quot;Davis&quot; continued on for her home port, reaching Charleston on 17 September. There, she then underwent a restricted availability (1 November – 2 December) for necessary engineering repairs, then carried out an underway period for certification (11–16 December), after which time she remained in port for the remainder of 1978.

Underway once more on 16 January 1979, &quot;Davis&quot; took on stores and received turnover briefs at Rota (28–30 January), then proceeded into the Mediterranean to begin her deployment. After a visit to Livorno, Italy (6–11 February), she participated in exercises at sea, capped by a visit to Dubrovnik (19–24 February). Clearing that Yugoslavian port to participate in National Week exercises, at 22:30 on 25 February &quot;Davis&quot; was ordered to proceed to Middle East. Reaching Port Said on 28 February, she transited the Suez Canal (1–2 March), then operated in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden until 15 March. Having gone from the Second Fleet to the Sixth, thence to MidEastFor, the ship became a part of the Seventh Fleet, operating with a part of its carrier force, until 9 April. Visiting Djibouti again (9–11 April), &quot;Davis&quot; then stood into Port Said on 15 April to transit the Suez Canal. Reaching Catania, Sicily, on 19 April 1979, to begin a four-day visit, &quot;Davis&quot; then spent 17 days at Athens (30 April – 15 May) for upkeep &quot;amid rumors of yet another trip to the Middle East.&quot; Twelve hours after departing Athens on 15 May, &quot;Davis&quot; received orders sending her back to the Suez Canal. Transiting that waterway on 18 May, she fueled at Port Sudan (21 May), then spent two days at Berbera, Somalia (26–27 May), where she hosted the U.S. Ambassador to Somalia Donald K. Petterson and military attachés from China, Egypt, and Italy. The officials of Berbera gave the ship six goats. After crossing the Equator for the fourth consecutive year (4 June), &quot;Davis&quot; visited Mombasa (6–12 June), then Djibouti (19–20 June). After a passage through the Suez Canal (25 June), she reached Rota (1–2 July) before standing out for her homeward bound voyage, arriving at her home port on 14 July. Off-loading ammunition (16–17 August), &quot;Davis&quot; then commenced a regular overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard on 28 September and entered drydock on 8 November.

===1980s===
Completing her overhaul on 10 December 1980, &quot;Davis&quot; remained in port into late January 1981, punctuating that time with local operations and independent ship exercises (6–14 January), steaming thence to Port Everglades to carry out weapons systems accuracy trials (27 January – 7 February) and then returning to her home port. Departing Charleston for Guantanamo Bay on 13 March to begin five weeks of refresher training, visiting Port au Prince during a breather in the work, &quot;Davis&quot; next headed for Roosevelt Roads to conduct naval gunfire support exercises, climaxed with a visit to Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands. Returning to Charleston on 3 May, &quot;Davis&quot; underwent an IMAV/NWAI. Departing her home port on 12 June, the ship operated as part of the Battle Group in ComPTUEx 2-81, conducting extensive ASW and AAW exercises during that time, after which she enjoyed rest and recreation at Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands. Detached from the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Battle Group upon conclusion of that period, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to Charleston on 30 June to prepare for her next extended deployment.

Sailing for the Mediterranean on 13 August 1981, &quot;Davis&quot; reached Rota on 22 August and joined the Sixth Fleet. After departing Rota on 24 August, she transited the Strait of Gibraltar, then proceeded along the Spanish coast to Cartagena, which she visited (26–30 August), providing &quot;hotel services&quot; while anchored out to submarine as the latter moored alongside. Moving on to Naples (2–5 September), she then conducted a War-At-Sea exercise with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Battle Group (6–8 September) before conducting calling at Alexandria, Egypt (9–11 September) and Ashdod, Israel (13–23 September), receiving a tender availability alongside at the latter port. Proceeding thence for the Suez Canal, &quot;Davis&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Voge&quot;, prepared for trouble in the wake of the recent signing of an accord between Libya, Ethiopia and Yemen, but accomplished the passage of the Bab-el-Mandeb &quot;with no confrontation&quot; on the night of 27 September.

After pausing for fuel at Djibouti (28 September 1981), &quot;Davis&quot; joined the &quot;America&quot; Battle Group for operations in the Arabian Sea (29 September – 18 October). Carrying out high-priority ASW and AAW, as well as surveillance, evolutions, the ship also carried out an exchange program with the Royal Australian Navy guided missile destroyer exchanging six people with her &quot;down under&quot; opposite number over each of the three days. Participating in a Gonzo Regatta at the conclusion of that period, competing in both gig and motor whaleboat events, &quot;Davis&quot; won the former race, with Rear Admiral Bryan W. Compton, Commander, Carrier Group 6, presenting the award to the boat officer.

Transiting the Strait of Hormuz on 19 October 1981, &quot;Davis&quot; entered the Persian Gulf for what would become &quot;nearly constant underway time,&quot; punctuated by fuel stops and liberty at Bahrain and Jubayl, Saudi Arabia. At the former place, Rear Admiral Charles E. Gurney, III, Commander, MidEastFor, presented 57 members of &quot;Davis&quot;s complement with Navy Achievement Medals &quot;for meritorious performance during the deployment,&quot; while at the latter, the ship hosted the commanding officer of the King Abdulaziz Naval Base and the Amir of Jubayl. Upon completion of the &quot;surveillance and showing the flag tour&quot; on 16 November, the destroyer headed west, made a high-speed passage of the Bab-el-Mandeb and Red Sea, then moored at Jiddah (23–25 November), hosting U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Richard W. Murphy, as well as 200 Royal Saudi Navy students during that visit (24 November).

Departing Jiddah on 26 November 1981, the ship transited the Suez Canal the following day. Encountering heavy seas upon entering the Mediterranean, she then carried out exercises off the coast of Libya, transited the Strait of Messina, and visited Marseille, France (2–5 December). After a transit of the Strait of Gibraltar, &quot;Davis&quot; visited Rota for turnover procedures (9–11 December), then sailed for home with ComDesRon 20 embarked. She reached Charleston four days before Christmas, to begin the first of three shifts of leave for her people upon arrival and ending the year in &quot;normal inport routine.&quot;

Following her post-deployment stand-down, and sea trials off Charleston, &quot;Davis&quot; departed her home port on 25 January 1982 for operations in the Caribbean and gunfire support exercises off Vieques. After visiting San Juan (1–5 February), she proceeded thence for a port call upon Port Everglades (7–11 February), where she embarked a group of sons of her officers and men for the cruise back to Charleston, where she arrived on 13 February. Following an InSurv inspection (1–3 March) and sea trials in the operating areas off her home port, &quot;Davis&quot; got underway on 8 April to participate in ReadEx 2-82 and Ocean Venture 82, rendezvousing with elements of Amphibious Group 2 off the North Carolina coast, proceeding thence to screen those ships and provide gunfire support support for the landings at Vieques, earning a score of 86.4 in the latter role and destroying two target sleeves during another phase of the evolutions. Punctuating her participation in the exercises by a visit to Charlotte Amalie (16–19 April) and two to Roosevelt Roads for fuel (24–25 April and 6–8 May), Davis returned home on 12 May.

Following two NWAT visits (19–21 May 1982 and 7–9 June) and an ammunition onload at the Naval Weapons Station, Charleston (21-22 June), &quot;Davis&quot; conducted ASW exercises in the operating areas off her home port, utilizing the services provided by two submarines and ASW P-3C Orions. Over the ensuing months (July–August), the crew learned of &quot;growing evidence to expect de-commissioning in late December...&quot; but the ship deployed on 23 August to participate in United Effort/Northern Wedding-82, &quot;an operation of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] forces larger than any peacetime exercise before.&quot; Joining the &quot;America&quot; Battle Group off the Virginia capes, &quot;Davis&quot; steamed across the North Atlantic, conducting exercises and replenishing from NATO warships off the Irish coast, steaming into the region of the Shetland Islands and into the North Sea, where the group disbanded and &quot;Davis&quot; proceeded independently into the English Channel (15 September), and mooring at Southampton, England, on 16 September, the first U.S. Navy warship in recent memory to visit that port.

Underway on 22 September 1982 for the short transit to Brest, France, &quot;Davis&quot; visit (23–26 September) was cut short by growing tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, in and around Lebanon. &quot;Davis&quot; rejoined the &quot;America&quot; Battle Group to conduct &quot;contingency operations&quot; and transited the Strait of Gibraltar, then proceeded immediately into the Ionian Sea to exercise with elements of the Turkish and Greek navies (&quot;the first such joint effort,&quot; Davis&#x27;s chronicler noted, &quot;between [those] two navies in recent times&quot;) as well as other NATO units during exercise Display Determination 82.

After escorting &quot;America&quot; back to the northern waters of the Caribbean Operating Area, &quot;Davis&quot; returned to her home port on 20 October 1982, and commenced &quot;the decommissioning process...in earnest.&quot; After an ammunition offload at the Naval Weapons Station, Charleston, the ship underwent an Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility inspection (16–17 November).

==Fate==
USS &quot;Davis&quot; was decommissioned on 20 December 1982, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 July 1990 and sold for scrap to the Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 11 December 1992. When the company went bankrupt, she was resold to N. R. Acquisition Incorporated of New York City by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court and scrapped by Wilmington Resources of Wilmington in North Carolina.

<text>In Western astrology, astrological signs are the twelve 30-degree sectors that make up Earth&#x27;s 360-degree orbit around the Sun. The signs enumerate from the first day of spring, known as the First Point of Aries, which is the vernal equinox. The astrological signs are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. The Western zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology, and was later influenced by the Hellenistic culture. Each sign was named after a constellation the sun annually moved through while crossing the sky. This observation is emphasized in the simplified and popular sun sign astrology. Over the centuries, Western astrology&#x27;s zodiacal divisions have shifted out of alignment with the constellations they were named after by axial precession of the Earth while Hindu astrology measurements correct for this shifting. Astrology (i.e. a system of omina based on celestial appearances) was developed in Chinese and Tibetan cultures as well but these astrologies are not based upon the zodiac but deal with the whole sky.

Astrology is a pseudoscience. Scientific investigations of the theoretical basis and experimental verification of claims have shown it to have no scientific validity or explanatory power. More plausible explanations for the apparent correlation between personality traits and birth months exist, such as the influence of seasonal birth in humans.

According to astrology, celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the principle of &quot;as above, so below&quot;, so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of expression. Scientific astronomy used the same sectors of the ecliptic as Western astrology until the 19th century.

Various approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of astrology, although the tradition of the Zodiac&#x27;s names and symbols remain mostly consistent. Western astrology measures from Equinox and Solstice points (points relating to equal, longest, and shortest days of the tropical year), while Hindu astrology measures along the equatorial plane (sidereal year).

== Western zodiac signs ==
=== History ===

Western astrology is a direct continuation of Hellenistic astrology as recorded in Ptolemy&#x27;s Tetrabiblos in the 2nd century. Hellenistic astrology in turn was partly based on concepts from Babylonian tradition. Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction. This division of the ecliptic originated in the Babylonian &quot;ideal calendar&quot; found in the old compendium MUL.APIN and its combination with the Babylonian lunar calendar, represented as the &quot;path of the moon&quot; in MUL.APIN. In a way, the zodiac is the idealisation of an ideal lunar calendar.

By the 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomy and its system of celestial omens influenced the culture of ancient Greece, as did the astronomy of Egypt by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and the creation of Horoscopic astrology, employing the use of the Ascendant (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve houses. Association of the astrological signs with Empedocles&#x27; four classical elements was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.

The body of the Hellenistic astrological tradition as it stood by the 2nd century is described in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot;. This is the seminal work for later astronomical tradition not only in the West but also in India and the Islamic sphere and has remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.

===Western astrological correspondence chart===

The following table shows the approximate dates of the twelve astrological signs, along with the classical and modern rulerships of each sign. By definition, Aries starts at the First Point of Aries which is the location of the Sun at the March equinox. The precise date of the Equinox varies from year to year but is always between 19 March and 21 March. The consequence is the start date of Aries and therefore the start date of all the other signs can change slightly from year to year. The following Western astrology table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude with the Latin names. The longitude intervals, are treated as closed for the first endpoint (&quot;a&quot;) and open for the second (&quot;b&quot;) – for instance, 30° of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. The signs are occasionally numbered 0 through 11 in place of symbols in astronomical works.


The twelve signs are positioned in a circular pattern, creating a pattern of oppositions related to different philosophically polarized attributes. Fire and air elements are generally 180 degrees opposed in Western astrology, as well as earth and water elements. Not all systems of astrology have four elements, notably the Sepher Yetzirah describes only three elements emanating from a central divine source. Spring signs are opposite to autumn ones, winter signs are opposite to summer ones and vice versa.
* Aries is opposite to Libra
* Taurus is opposite to Scorpio
* Gemini is opposite to Sagittarius
* Cancer is opposite to Capricorn
* Leo is opposite to Aquarius
* Virgo is opposite to Pisces

==== Polarity ====
In Western astrology, the polarity divides the zodiac in half and refers to the alignment of a sign&#x27;s energy as either positive or negative, with various attributes associated to them as a result. Positive polarity signs, also called active, yang, expressive, or masculine signs, are the six odd-numbered signs of the zodiac: Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. Positive signs make up the fire and air triplicities. Negative polarity signs, also called passive, yin, receptive, or feminine signs, are the six even-numbered signs of the zodiac: Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. Negative signs make up the earth and water triplicities.

==== The three modalities ====
The modality or mode of a given sign refers to its position in the season it is found in. Each of the four elements manifests in three modalities: cardinal, fixed, and mutable. Since each modality comprehends four signs, they are also known as Quadruplicities. For example, the sign Aries is found in the first month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, so practitioners of astrology describe it as having a cardinal modality. The combination of element and modality provides the signs with their unique characterizations. For instance, Capricorn is the cardinal earth sign, impressing its association with action (cardinal modality) in the material world (earth element).

====Triplicities of the four elements====

The Greek philosopher Empedocles identified fire, earth, air, and water as elements in the fifth-century BC. He explained the nature of the universe as an interaction of two opposing principles, love and strife, which manipulate the elements into different mixtures that produce the different natures of things. He stated all the elements are equal, the same age, rule their own provinces, and possess their own individual character. Empedocles said that those born with nearly equal proportions of the elements are more intelligent and have the most exact perceptions.

The elemental categories are called triplicities because each classical element is associated with three signs The four astrological elements are also considered as a direct equivalent to Hippocrates&#x27; personality types (sanguine = air; choleric = fire; melancholic = earth; phlegmatic = water). A modern approach looks at elements as &quot;the energy substance of experience&quot; and the next table tries to summarize their description through keywords. The elements have grown in importance and some astrologers begin natal chart interpretations by studying the balance of elements in the location of planets (especially the Sun&#x27;s and Moon&#x27;s ascendant signs) and the position of angles in the chart.

==== Celestial body rulerships ====


Rulership is the connection between planet and correlated sign and house. The conventional rulerships are as follows: 
*Aries: Mars 
*Taurus: Venus
*Gemini: Mercury
*Cancer: Moon
*Leo: Sun
*Virgo: Mercury
*Libra: Venus
*Scorpio: classically Mars, Pluto starting in the 20th century
*Sagittarius: Jupiter
*Capricorn: Saturn
*Aquarius: classically Saturn, Uranus starting in the 20th century
*Pisces: classically Jupiter, Neptune starting in the 20th century

==== Dignity and detriment, exaltation and fall ====

A traditional belief of astrology, known as essential dignity, is the idea that the Sun, Moon, and planets are more powerful and effective in some signs than others because the basic nature of both is held to be in harmony. By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. These categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation, and Fall.

* Dignity and Detriment: A planet is strengthened or dignified if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise &quot;Rulership&quot; of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered &quot;strong&quot; (well-dignified). If a planet is in the sign opposite which it rules (or is dignified in), it is said to be weakened or in Detriment (for example, the Moon in Capricorn). This may also be termed a &quot;debility&quot;.

In traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation, Triplicity, Terms or bounds, and Face or Decan, which together are known as describing a planet&#x27;s &quot;Essential dignity&quot;, the quality or ability of one&#x27;s true nature.

* Exaltation and Fall: A planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of exaltation. In traditional horary astrology, this denotes a dignity just less than rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet&#x27;s significance(s) the dignity of an honoured guest: the centre of attention but constrained in power. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree with this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of this is in its fall, and thus weakened, perhaps more than Detriment. There is discord as to the signs in which the two extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.

In addition to essential dignity, the traditional astrologer considers &quot;Accidental dignity&quot; of planets. This is placement by house in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet&#x27;s &quot;ability to act&quot;. So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature. The twelfth is a cadent house as are the third, sixth and ninth and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the first, fourth, seventh, or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (second, fifth, eighth, eleventh) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of &quot;Accidental Debilities&quot;, such as retrogradation, Under the Sun&#x27;s Beams, Combust, and so forth.

==== Additional classifications ====

Each sign can be divided into three 10° sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler. The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity. The last decanate is sub-ruled by the next in order in the same triplicity.

While the element and modality of a sign are together sufficient to define it, they can be grouped to indicate their symbolism. The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs. The last four signs of the zodiac, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces, form the group of transpersonal signs.

Dane Rudhyar presented the tropical zodiac primary factors, used in the curriculum of the RASA School of Astrology. The tropical zodiac is the zodiac of seasonal factors as opposed to the sidereal zodiac (constellation factors). The primary seasonal factors are based on the changing ratio of sunlight and darkness across the year. The first factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when daylight is increasing, or the half of the year when darkness is increasing. The second factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when there is more daylight than darkness, or the half when there is more darkness than daylight. The third factor is which of the four seasons the chosen time falls in, defined by the first two factors. Thus 
* The &quot;spring&quot; season is when daylight is increasing and there is more daylight than darkness.
* The &quot;summer&quot; season is when darkness is increasing and there is more daylight than darkness.
* The &quot;autumn&quot; season is when darkness is increasing and there is more darkness than daylight.
* The &quot;winter&quot; season is when daylight is increasing and there is more darkness than daylight.

== Indian astrology ==
In Indian astrology, there are five elements: fire, earth(Land), air, water, and ether. The master of fire is Mars, while Mercury is of land, Saturn of air, Venus of water, and Jupiter of ether.

Jyotisha recognises twelve zodiac signs (Rāśi), that correspond to those in Western astrology. The relation of the signs to the elements is the same in the two systems.

=== Nakshatras ===
A nakshatra (Devanagari: नक्षत्र, Sanskrit &#x27;, a metaphorical compound of &#x27; &#x27;map/chart&#x27;, and &#x27; &#x27;guard&#x27;), or lunar mansion, is one of the 27 divisions of the sky identified by prominent star(s), as used in Hindu astronomy and astrology (Jyotisha). &quot;Nakshatra&quot; in Sanskrit, Kannada, Tulu and Tamil and Prakrit also, thus, it refers to stars themselves.

== Chinese zodiac signs ==
Chinese astrological signs operate on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (also known as &quot;shichen&quot;). A particular feature of the Chinese zodiac is its operation in a 60-year cycle in combination with the Five Phases of Chinese astrology (Wood, Fire, Metal, Water and Earth).
Nevertheless, some researches say that there is an obvious relationship between the Chinese 12-year cycle and zodiac constellations: each year of the cycle corresponds to a certain disposal of Jupiter. For example, in the year of Snake Jupiter is in the Sign of Gemini, in the year of Horse Jupiter is in the Sign of Cancer and so on. So the Chinese 12-year calendar is a solar-lunar-jovian calendar.

=== Zodiac symbolism ===
The following table shows the twelve signs and their attributes.

=== The twelve signs ===

In Chinese astrology, the zodiac of twelve animal signs represents twelve different types of personality. The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the Rat, and there are many stories about the Origins of the Chinese Zodiac which explain why this is so. When the twelve zodiac signs are part of the 60-year calendar in combination with the four elements, they are traditionally called the twelve Earthly Branches. The Chinese zodiac follows the lunisolar Chinese calendar and thus the &quot;changeover&quot; days in a month (when one sign changes to another sign) vary each year. The following are the twelve zodiac signs in order.

# Rat (Yang, 1st Trine, Fixed Element Water): Rat years include 1900, 1912, 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020, 2032. The Rat also corresponds to a particular month in the year. The hours of the Rat are 11pm – 1am.

The five elements operate together with the twelve animal signs in a 60-year calendar. The five elements appear in the calendar in both their yin and yang forms and are known as the ten Heavenly Stems. The yin/yang split seen in the Gregorian calendar means years that end in an even number are Yang (representing masculine, active, and light), those that end with an odd number are Yin (representing feminine, passive and darkness), subject to Chinese New Year having passed.

<text>USS &quot;Walke&quot; (DD-416) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy, named after Rear Admiral Henry A. Walke USN (1809–1896). &quot;Walke&quot; operated with the Neutrality Patrol in the Caribbean before World War II and fought in the Pacific Theater during the war before being sunk in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.

&quot;Walke&quot; was laid down by the Naval Shipyard at Boston in Massachusetts on 31 May 1938, launched on 20 October 1939 by Mrs. Clarence Dillon, grandniece of Rear Admiral Walke and commissioned on 27 April 1940.

==Service history==

===Inter-War period===
Following fitting-out and engineering trials, &quot;Walke&quot; took on board torpedoes, warheads, and exercise warheads at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, on 25 June and sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, on the following day. She reached Norfolk on 27 June and there embarked Second Lieutenant Donald B. Cooley, USMC, and 47 enlisted marines for transportation to , then in South American waters. Later that same day, in company with , &quot;Walke&quot; got underway for Cuba.

After fueling at Guantanamo on 4 July, &quot;Walke&quot; got underway for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at 0658 on 6 July, again in company with &quot;Wainwright&quot;, En route, the destroyers were diverted to the mouth of the Surinam River, where &quot;Walke&quot; took on board an appendicitis patient from &quot;Wainwright&quot; for passage to Paramaribo for medical attention. After transferring the patient, Pvt. Lawrence P. Coghlan, USMC, ashore, &quot;Walke&quot; got underway for Pará, Brazil, where she fueled before pushing on for Rio de Janeiro.

&quot;Walke&quot; and &quot;Wainwright&quot; reached Rio on 19 July. &quot;Walke&quot; then transferred her marine passengers, half of the heavy cruiser&#x27;s marine detachment, to &quot;Wichita&quot; while &quot;Wainwright&quot; transferred hers to . Due to unsettled conditions in the area, the two cruisers were in South American waters, &quot;showing the flag&quot; and evidencing strong American interest in the &quot;good neighbors&quot; south of the border.

Still operating in company with her sister ship, &quot;Walke&quot; visited Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santos and Bahia, Brazil, and made a return call to Buenos Aires before rendezvousing with &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Wichita&quot; on 15 August. &quot;Walke&quot; took on board mail, freight, and embarked passengers from &quot;Wichita&quot; before getting underway and steaming via Bahia and Guantanamo Bay to the Boston Navy Yard where she arrived on the morning of 4 September. &quot;Walke&quot; underwent post-shakedown repairs for the rest of that month and all of October before she joined the United States Fleet as a unit of Destroyer Division 4, Destroyer Squadron 2, Patrol Force. In mid-November, she served as the vehicle for degaussing tests under the auspices of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at Solomons Island, Maryland. Returning to Norfolk upon the conclusion of those tests, &quot;Walke&quot; set her course southward on 2 December, bound once more for Guantanamo Bay.

&quot;Walke&quot;″s active service had begun in the spring of 1940, when Germany was unleashing her military might in Norway and the lowlands of western Europe to turn the so-called Phony War into the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; which swept across northern France, driving British troops off the continent and knocking France out of the war. The resulting establishment of a new government in that country, more favorable to Germany, aroused fear in Allied and neutral circles that French fighting forces, particularly French warships, might be placed in German hands. &quot;Walke&quot; would have a role in seeing that this unfortunate development would never take place.

After fueling at San Juan on 6 December, the destroyer got underway on the afternoon of the following day on &quot;Caribbean Patrol&quot; in company with . Rendezvousing with and off Fort-de-France, Martinique, &quot;Walke&quot; and &quot;O’Brien&quot; patrolled the approaches to that port, keeping an eye on the movements of Vichy French warships , , and , through 14 December. &quot;Walke&quot; then visited Castries, British West Indies, on 15 December and embarked Comdr. Lyman K. Swenson, Commander, Destroyer Division 17, who hoisted his pennant in her that day.

&quot;Walke&quot; put into Guantanamo Bay on 19 December 1940, and remained there into the new year, moored in a nest with , undergoing upkeep. In ensuing weeks, &quot;Walke&quot; operated in the Guantanamo Bay-Gonaïves, Haiti, areas, conducting battle and torpedo practices, engaging in a full slate of the training exercises assigned such ships in those areas. She then shifted to Fajardo, Puerto Rico, and operated from there through mid-March.

&quot;Walke&quot; then sailed north and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 20 March 1941 for a period of repairs and alterations that lasted into May. She touched briefly at Norfolk between 10 and 13 May before reaching Newport, her base for the better part of the year, on the following day.

&quot;Walke&quot; then patrolled off the Atlantic coast between Norfolk and Newport well into June 1941 as the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s neutrality patrols were steadily extended eastward, closer to the European war zone. She departed Newport on 27 July and screened a convoy to Iceland, reaching Reykjavík on 6 August and turning toward Norfolk the same day, her charges safely delivered.

The destroyer subsequently returned to those northern climes in mid-September, after local operations in the Newport-Boston area — reaching Hvalfjörður on 14 September. She operated in Icelandic waters into late September, before she put into NS Argentia, Newfoundland, on 11 October, en route to Casco Bay, Maine.

===World War II===
&quot;Walke&quot; began an overhaul at the Boston Navy Yard on 25 November 1941 and completed it on 7 December 1941, the &quot;day of infamy&quot; on which Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and thrust the United States into war in the Pacific. Departing the yard on that day, &quot;Walke&quot; reached Norfolk on 12 December, via Casco Bay, and remained there until 16 December when she sailed for the Panama Canal and the Pacific

After reaching San Diego, California, on 30 December, &quot;Walke&quot; sailed with the newly formed Task Force 17 (TF17), bound for the South Pacific, on 6 January 1942, screening as she covered the movement of reinforcements for the Marine garrison on American Samoa. The convoy subsequently arrived at Tutuila on 24 January. However, TF 17 remained in Samoan waters for only a short time, for it soon sailed north for the Marshall–Gilbert Islands area to deliver the first offensive blow to the enemy, only eight weeks after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Walke&quot; served in the antisubmarine screen and plane-guarded for the &quot;Yorktown&quot; as that carrier launched air strikes on suspected Japanese installations on the atolls of Jaluit, Makin, and Mili Atolls. Although Admiral Chester Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet (CinCPAC), considered the raids &quot;well-conceived, well-planned, and brilliantly executed&quot;, the damage they actually caused was not as great as reported; and, outside the boost they gave to American morale, the attacks were only a minor nuisance to the Japanese. Nevertheless, the American Fleet had finally taken the war to the enemy.

Returning to Hawaiian waters on 7 February 1942, &quot;Walke&quot; trained in the Hawaiian area until 27 February, when she sailed for the Ellice Islands. She later exercised with TF 17 off New Caledonia in early March before she sailed, again screening &quot;Yorktown&quot;, for the New Guinea area, as part of the force put together to check Japanese expansion in that area.

By that time, the enemy advance to the southward, in the New Guinea-New Britain area, had gained considerable momentum with the occupation of Rabaul and Gasmata, New Britain; Kavieng, New Ireland; and on sites on Bougainville in the Solomon Islands and in the Louisiades. By the end of February 1942, it seemed probable that the Japanese were planning to mount an offensive in early March. TFs 11 and 17 were dispatched to the area. Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, in overall charge of the operation, initially selected Rabaul and Gasmata, in New Britain, and Kavieng, in New Ireland, as targets for the operation.

&quot;Walke&quot; then screened &quot;Yorktown&quot; as she launched air strikes on Tulagi in the Solomons on 4 May 1942 and later separated from that carrier with the &quot;Support Force&quot; (, , and ) to protect the southern mouth of the Jomard Passage. On the afternoon of 7 May, Japanese Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers attacked the formation, but the heavy antiaircraft fire thrown up by the ships caused the enemy to retire without scoring any hits.

An hour after the &quot;Vals&quot; departed, however, Japanese twin-engined bombers appeared and made a torpedo attack from dead ahead. Again, a heavy volume of antiaircraft fire from &quot;Walke&quot; and the other destroyers peppered the skies. Five bombers splashed into the sea, and no torpedoes found their mark on the Allied ships. Later, 19 high altitude bombers passed over, dropping sticks of bombs that splashed harmlessly into the water. Antiaircraft fire proved ineffective, due to the high altitude maintained by the planes. However, the last group of planes were apparently American planes. The force commander, the Australian Rear Admiral John Crace, swore that the planes were B-26 Marauders; &quot;Walke&quot;″s commander, Commander Thomas E. Fraser, subsequently reported them to be B-17 Flying Fortresses. In any event, it was fortunate that the bombardiers were not too accurate.

On 7 March, Allied intelligence learned that a Japanese surface force, including transports, lay off Buna, Papua New Guinea. On the following day, Japanese troops went ashore at Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea, and secured those places by noon.

Three days later, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and launched air strikes against the newly established Japanese beachheads at Lae and Salamaua. The attack took the enemy by surprise. The planes from the two American flattops came in from over the Owen Stanley Mountains and inflicted damage on ships, small craft, and shore installations, before they retired.

&quot;Walke&quot; remained at sea with the &quot;Yorktown&quot; task force into April. Detached to escort and , the destroyer reached Suva, in Fiji, on 19 April and got underway the next day, bound for the Tonga Islands. Reaching Tongatapu on 22 April, &quot;Walke&quot; fueled from before she underwent boiler repairs and loaded depth charges prior to her return to TF 17.

Detached from the group because of a damaged starboard reduction gear, &quot;Walke&quot; headed to Australia for repairs and reached Brisbane on 12 May. Upon completion of the work on 29 May, the destroyer ran trials in the Brisbane River before being pronounced fit for service and sailed for New Caledonia on 9 June.

Arriving at Nouméa on 13 June, &quot;Walke&quot; fueled there before proceeding via Tongatapu to Pago Pago, American Samoa, Samoa. Assigned to Task Group 12.1 (TG 12.1), the destroyer sailed on 26 June for Bora Bora in the Society Islands. With the dissolution of TG 12.1 on 11 July, &quot;Walke&quot; then reported for duty to Commander, TG 6.7, the commanding officer of . She then escorted &quot;Castor&quot; to San Francisco, California, arriving there on 2 August.

On 7 August, while &quot;Walke&quot; was undergoing repairs and alterations at the nearby Mare Island Navy Yard, the United States Navy wrested the initiative in the war from Japan by landing marines on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. In ensuing months, the armed forces of the two nations struggled mightily for control of that island chain. The contest soon developed into a logistics race as each side tried to frustrate its opponent&#x27;s efforts to reinforce and supply his forces fighting on Guadalcanal while doing all in his power to strengthen his own. &quot;Walke&quot;″s future was to be inextricably tied to the almost daily, and nightly, American air and naval attempts to best the Japanese in their thrusts down New Georgia Sound the strategic body of water which stretches between the two lines of islands which make up the Solomons chain and lead to Guadalcanal.

Completing the yard work on 25 August, &quot;Walke&quot; ran her trials in San Francisco Bay and that day received orders to proceed to San Pedro, California, to rendezvous with the oiler and escorted her from the west coast of the United States, via Nouméa, New Caledonia, to Tongatapu, arriving there on 9 September. The destroyer later escorted a convoy consisting of &quot;Kankakee&quot;, , and from Tongatapu to Nouméa, where she prepared for action in the Solomons.

====Naval Battle of Guadalcanal====
About sunset on 13 November 1942, the day after the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal began, &quot;Walke&quot; sortied with TF 64 which was built around and and, besides &quot;Walke&quot;, was screened by , , and . By late in the forenoon on 14 November, TF 64 had reached a point some south-by-west from Guadalcanal.

Sighted by the enemy, who reported them as one battleship, one cruiser, and four destroyers, the American warships spent most of the day on 14 November avoiding contact with enemy planes. From the information available in dispatches, the commander of the American task force, Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee, knew of the presence of three groups of enemy ships in the area, one of which was formed around at least two battleships.

Proceeding through the flat calm sea and disposed in column formation with &quot;Walke&quot; leading, the American ships approached on a northerly course about nine miles (17 km) west of Guadalcanal.

Lee&#x27;s ships continued making their passage, picking up Japanese voice transmissions on the radio while the ships&#x27; radar &quot;eyes&quot; scanned the darkness. At 0006 on 15 November, &quot;Washington&quot; received a report that indicated the presence of three ships, rounding the north end of Savo Island, headed westward. Almost simultaneously the flagship&#x27;s radar picked up two ships on the same bearing.

Ten minutes later, &quot;Washington&quot; opened fire with her guns; and, within seconds, &quot;South Dakota&quot; followed suit. &quot;Walke&quot; opened fire at 0026, maintaining a rapid barrage at what probably was . After checking fire within a few minutes, the lead destroyer opened up again at a Japanese destroyer to starboard (likely either &quot;Ayanami&quot; or ) and, later, at gunflashes off her port side near Guadalcanal.

===Sinking===

Report of Action USS Walke (DD-416) 15 November 1942 (dated 30 November 1942 from Senior Officer Present - W.J Collum, Jr., Lieut. USN)

1. Task Force 64 engaged the enemy off Savo Island on the night of 14-15 November. US Forces formed in a column in the following order: WALKE, BENHAM, PRESTON, GWIN, WASHINGTON, SOUTH DAKOTA, under the command of USS WASHINGTON.

2. The wind was slight. Conditions of visibility were in general poor due to the enemy position close against shorelines of Salvo and Guadalcanal Islands. Radar ranges accurately obtainable only when enemy drew away from close island backgrounds.

3. Estimated order of events follows as all logs and records went down with the ship. The formations as described steamed on course 150 True between Florida and Savo Islands until approximately 00:20, reducing speed from 23 to 17 knots in search of the reported enemy. At 00:20 turned to course 270 True.

At 00:30 following action of WASHINGTON and South DAKOTA, WALKE opened fire to starboard on visible target believed to be a cruiser with a single raked stack. WALKE continued rapid fire on this target for two minutes with FOX DOG Radar range 11,000 yards. The target appeared to blow up under heavily concentrated fire. Our formation increased speed to 26 knots.

At 00:32 checked fired and shifted target to apparent enemy destroyer bearing one point on the starboard bow. Resumed rapid fire at the rage of 7,500 yards by Radar. Apparent straddled clearly visible followed by heavy black smoke. Flames were reported on the target as she disappeared behind the northwest point of Savo Island.

At 00:37 checked fire to shift target to port hand flashes of gunfire off Guadalcanal. Resumed rapid fire., Numerous gun flashes visible on starboard hand.

At 00:37 USS PRESTON blew up astern of WALKE.

At 00:39 attempted to shift torpedo battery from Curved Fire Ahead setup to Broadside Fire to Starboard when a heavy explosion occurred in the vicinity of frame 45 to starboard. WALKE had been straddled twice by gunfire immediately prior to this explosion caused by torpedo whose wake was observed. Following initial explosion, WALKE was struck by an apparent cruiser salvo. Shell hits were reported in the Radio Room, on the foremast, below the gig davits and in the vicinity of gun three. The explosion blew the forecastle and a section of the superstructure desk completely off as far aft as the bridge. Fires broke out throughout the forward section and the forward 20mm magazine exploded. The bulkhead of the forward fireroom was buckled, as was the main deck amidships. All engines were ordered to stop immediately and the commanding officer gave the order to abandon ship, which was sinking fast by the head. Only two life rafts were left in a condition to be freed. Depth charges were double checked and reported set on safe.

At 00:42 the ship disappeared stern last. The bow, detached, remained afloat.

At 00:43, an unknown number of WALKE&#x27;s depth charges exploded, killing and seriously injuring many of the men in the water. The crew was organized in the water and seriously injured being placed on the rafts.

At approximately 02:00 an enemy submarine surfaced close to the rafts and illuminated all survivors for several minutes, but proceeded without incident. An enemy destroyer later illuminated survivors on the detached bow. There was much shouting from this vessel, but she also proceeded without taking action. Survivors were sighted and signaled at dawn by friendly aircraft.
The USS MEADE was observed throughout the morning of 15 November firing on beached enemy transports. USS MEADE commenced picking up survivors with the aid of boats and cruiser aircraft at 14:00.
151 survivors were landed on Tulagi, where six died of wounds received in action. Total killed or missing in action were six officers and seventy-six enlisted.

4. During the action, the USS WALKE expended approximately 300 5inch anti-aircraft common projectiles. Gun three stood by throughout the action for illumination by star shells.

5. The courage and coolness of the entire crew was excellent throughout the action and the difficult period in the water. Morale and cooperation was so high on the part of all the officers and men that is it impossible to cite any individual above the group for exceptional heroism. //signed WJ Collum Jr., Lt. USN//

Japanese shells straddled &quot;Walke&quot; twice, and then a &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedo slammed into her starboard side at a point almost directly below mount 52. Almost simultaneously, a salvo of shells from &quot;Nagara&quot;, &quot;Ayanami&quot;, and &quot;Uranami&quot; hurtled down upon the hapless destroyer, a deluge of steel that struck home with devastating effect in the radio room, the foremast, below the gig davits, and in the vicinity of mount 53, on the after deckhouse. Meanwhile, the torpedo had blown off the bow of the ship; and fire broke out as the forward 20-millimeter magazine blew up.

With the situation hopeless, Commander Thomas E. Fraser, &quot;Walke&quot;″s commanding officer, ordered the ship abandoned. As the destroyer sank rapidly by the bow, only two life rafts could be launched. The others had been damaged irreparably. After the crew made sure that the depth charges were set on safe, they went over the side just before the ship slipped swiftly under the surface.

As &quot;Washington&quot;, dueling with and smaller ships, swept through the flotsam and jetsam of battle, she briefly noted &quot;Walke&quot;″s plight and that of &quot;Preston&quot;, which had also gone down under in a deluge of shells. At 0041, just a minute or so before &quot;Walke&quot; sank, life rafts from the battleship splashed into the sea for the benefit of the survivors. Although the destroyer&#x27;s depth charges had apparently been set to &quot;safe&quot;, some depth charges went off, killing a number of swimming survivors and seriously injuring others. As the battle went on ahead of them, the able-bodied survivors placed their more seriously wounded comrades on rafts.

&quot;Walke&quot;″s survivors were, at one point, in two groups; some clinging to the still-floating bow section and others clustered around the two rafts that ship had been able to launch. During the harrowing night, they were twice illuminated by enemy warships but not molested, before the enemy switched off his searchlights and moved on.

At dawn, however, &quot;Walke&quot;″s survivors, and those from &quot;Preston&quot;, witnessed the end of a quartet of Japanese transports beached during the night. Bombed and strafed by Army, Marine, and Navy planes, including aircraft from , the four Japanese ships received the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; from the that morning, just before the destroyer altered course and picked up the destroyermen from &quot;Walke&quot; and &quot;Preston&quot;.

&quot;Meade&quot; rescued 151 men from &quot;Walke&quot;, six of whom later died after they were brought ashore at Tulagi. Six officers, including Commander Fraser, and 76 men had died in the ship&#x27;s fiery end off Savo Island. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 January 1943.

<text>Prepress is the term used in the printing and publishing industries for the processes and procedures that occur between the creation of a print layout and the final printing. The prepress process includes the preparation of artwork for press, media selection, proofing, quality control checks and the production of printing plates if required. The artwork is quite often provided by the customer as a print-ready PDF file created in desktop publishing.

==Processes==

# Binding selection gives the customer multiple options for the spine of the publication such as Saddle-stitched, Perfect Bound or Case Bound, also Spiral, Wire and Comb binding are possible. Each has its merits and suits a particular number of pages.
# Preparing artwork involves setting color profiles, bleed, registration and crop marks as specified by the printers, use spot colors, trapping and overprint as needed. Check transparency flattening results and allow for creep.
# Pre-flight is an automatic scan of the document using the printers pre-defined profile to find errors before submitting.
# Raster Image Processor (RIP) is the software/hardware that processes the print-ready files into a rasterized format that the printer can understand.
# Proofing involves creating an accurate copy of the artwork before beginning production runs. This serves as a bond between the printer and their customer that the final product meets an agreed-upon standard. Proofs in general can be done for all parts (images, illustrations, text and colors) of the print product. In this part, three types of proofing should be checked and printed out: the print-ready PDF files, the printer&#x27;s proof and the imposition proof. Print-ready PDF files should be made after the layout using preflight at the printing house. The printer&#x27;s proof should be printed out in high resolution and checked by the customer. The imposition proof, which is usually done by the printers, should also be printed out to check and adjust the printing press.
# Soft proofs are digital proofs that simulate accurately how the finished publication will look, intended to highlight any future issues.
# Hard proofs are physically printed proofs that simulate accurately how the finished publication will look, intended to highlight any future issues. 
# A Contract Proof serves as the agreement between a customer and a printer which is signed-off before the printing can begin. This can be digitally signed as a digital contract using services like Acrobat Sign.
# Quality control is performed throughout the prepress process but especially after the proofs are produced.
# Imposition is the arrangement of the printed product’s pages on the printer’s sheet, in order to obtain faster printing, simplify binding and reduce paper waste.
# Computer to plate (CTP) uses a laser to burn the image from a computer file onto a printing plate. Plates are made of different materials, depending on the needs of the printing method, usually Thermal, Photopolymer or Silver-Halogen (violet) plates are used. They usually have a processing stage in chemicals or liquid although process free plates are available.

In most modern publishing environments, the tasks related to content generation and refinement are carried out separately from other prepress tasks, and are commonly characterized as part of graphic design.

==Digital printing==

Digital printing allows printing a lower volume or individually customised publications; this is also known as Variable Data Printing (VDP). Variable Data Printing starts with a static piece of artwork and has an element that changes which can be fed from a database, such as a customer&#x27;s name. Conventional offset printing uses 4 printing plates for CMYK color publications making it only cost effective to print thousands of copies of each version. Digital printing is also cost effective for an individual publication with a fast turnaround. Toner cartridges or Inkjet Cartridges are used making them easy to operate and maintain. Advanced machines have options for additional spot colors with special inks such as metallic, fluorescent and white.

==Color management==

Managing color across the process involves having the right equipment and taking regular measurements. You need wide color gamut monitors that can best replicate a CMYK color space and have been calibrated. Pantone swatch guides are needed for color matching. A professional color profiling system like the ones listed at the International Color Consortium (ICC) and using ICC color profiles are required. Spectrophotometers to validate the color of the CMYK ink and spot colors are also important in prepress.

==Quality control==

Images in a print-ready PDF should be uploaded at 300dpi resolution. Any vector artwork or text should stay vector including clipping paths embedded in images for cutouts, as the RIP will rasterize them at 2400dpi, it can take about 10gb of data to create the rasterized image for the printing plates. Text and vector can print at 2400dpi if it only uses one solid color as there will be no halftone dithering, that&#x27;s why magazine text is so sharp. Images can only print at the equivalent of 300dpi because of the dithering needed for the gradients and mixed colors, although the dithering of the image is printed at 2400dpi (300dpi for images, and 2400dpi for text and vector are typical values stated by printers).

All artwork should be checked for imperfections in resolution, embedded fonts, color profiles, printers marks and any obvious mistakes that were missed during the writing, design, editing or proofreading stages, although prepress are not accountable as the artwork should already be agreed as print-ready. 

==Digital workflow==

Key prepress digital workflow software products include: Agfa Apogee, Fujifilm XMF, Heidelberg Prinect, Kodak Prinergy, Artworker and Fiery Workflow Suite. Important features when choosing digital workflow software or cloud submission and proofing software include: A version control system that helps you keep track of who is changing what and when. A secure system that lets different people check in and check out files and records when they do so. A method to lock down files currently in use to prevent simultaneous modifications by others. A way to lock out files so that only particular people can open them and change them, but anyone can view them.

==History==

During the 1980s and 1990s, computer-aided prepress techniques began to supplant the traditional dark room and light table processes, and by the early 2000s the word &quot;prepress&quot; became, in some ways, synonymous with digital pre-press. Immediately before the mainstream introduction of computers to the process, much of the industry was using large format cameras to make emulsion-based (film) copies of text and images. This film was then assembled (planning (UK) or stripping) and used to expose another layer of emulsion on a plate, thus copying images from one emulsion to another. This method is still used; however, as digital pre-press technology has become less cost intensive, more efficient and reliable, and as the knowledge and skill required to use the new hardware and especially software have become more widespread within the labor force, digital automation has been introduced to almost every part of the process. Some topics related to digital but not analog prepress include preflighting (verifying the presence, quality and format of each digital component), color management, and RIPing.

PDF workflows also became predominant. Vendors of Prepress systems, in addition to the offset printing industry, embraced a subset of the PDF format referred to as PDF/X1-a. This industry specific subset is one version of the PDF/X (PDF for eXchange) set of standards.

In more recent years, prepress software has been developed which is designed to find as many efficiencies in prepress workflow as possible. These tools are accessed online, and allow different workers to work on one project at the same time, often from different locations. Key functionality automates common steps to reduce errors, reinforce quality standards and speed up production. Examples include automatically re-folioing pages, digital dummies for soft proofs, live linking with Adobe InDesign and pre-flight checking. These tools revolve around a Flatplan and are used in all sorts of prepress including book, magazine and catalog production.

<text>USS &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; (DD-938), named for Admiral Jonas H. Ingram USN (1886–1952), awarded the Medal of Honor when a Lieutenant (junior grade) for his actions during the engagement of Vera Cruz on 22 April 1914, was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Quincy in Massachusetts on 15 June 1955, launched on 7 August 1956 by Mrs. Lawrence Hays, Jr., daughter of Admiral Ingram and commissioned on 19 July 1957 at Boston Naval Shipyard. USS &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; was decommissioned on 4 March 1983, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 June 1983 and sunk as a target on 23 July 1988.

==History==
Following shakedown in the Caribbean and along the western coast of South America, &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; departed Boston 26 February 1958 for patrols in the West Indies. She sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, 2 September for the Mediterranean to join the 6th Fleet and participate in NATO exercises.

She returned to Newport 12 March 1959 and sailed 16 June for Mayport, Florida, her new home port. She acted as recovery ship for an experimental Project Mercury nose-cone which splashed off the Florida coast 25 June.

The destroyer, as flagship for Rear Admiral E. C. Stephen, Commander South Atlantic Forces, sailed for the South Atlantic 24 August and conducted joint exercises with the French and South African navies visiting nine African countries from Tanganyika before returning May-port 15 November.

Highlights of the next 16 months of operations out of Mayport were duty providing air-sea rescue cover for President Eisenhower&#x27;s flights to and from the abortive Paris Summit Conference in May 1960 and a role in another Project Mercury space test late in the year. The hardy destroyer departed 15 March 1961 for the African coast to support United Nations peace-keeping efforts in the Congo. Richard York, who was known for his contributions to the vessel, was commissioned on the ship September 1973, and decommissioned in 1975.

Returning home 8 September, she sailed 18 October for NATO exercises in Northern European waters and returned 21 December. For the next two years &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; alternated Mediterranean deployments with operations out of Mayport. On 21 September 1964 she was one of our representatives at Malta during ceremonies at which Great Britain granted independence to the island. During this cruise she embarked four Turkish naval officers for a 4-week visit under the NATO exchange program. She returned from the Mediterranean in time to serve as one of the recovery ships for the unmanned Gemini space shot GT-2 in December. Atlantic Fleet ASW exercises in the North Atlantic during February 1965 were followed by Operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in the Caribbean in March. In the summer Jonas Ingram got underway on a people-to-people cruise in Middle Eastern waters and visited such parts as Djibouti, French Somaliland; Berbera, Somalia; Aden, Yemen; Karachi, Pakistan; and Beirut, Lebanon.

The destroyer returned to Mayport in the fall to become a recovery ship for Walter Schirra and Thomas Stafford&#x27;s Gemini 6 spacecraft in December. After operations in the Atlantic and Caribbean early in 1966 Jonas Ingram returned to the Mediterranean for service with the 6th Fleet. In September 1966 she accompanied Stribling (DD-867) to Port Said, the first U.S. warships to visit Egypt in almost 15 years.

&quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; returned home 20 October where she prepared for Exercise &quot;Lantflex 66-2.&quot; The fleet exercise took the destroyer to the Caribbean late in November and lasted through mid-December. Jonas Ingram operated out of Mayport until sailing for the Mediterranean 17 July 1967. She reach Gibraltar 29 July and steamed with the 6th Fleet into the fall.

The Jonas Ingram was decommissioned and modernized during an overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. One of the three five inch gunmounts was removed and an ASROC (anti-submarine rocket weapons system) was installed. The propulsion system was also upgraded to run on JP5 (jet fuel) rather than &quot;bunker C&quot;. The ship was recommissioned in Philadelphia in 1970 before returning to homeport in Mayport, Florida.

On 25 June 1973 USS &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; received an SOS from the Indian vessel merchantman and freighter &quot;Saudi&quot;, which had capsized in heavy seas off the coast of Somalia. Steaming through the night &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot;, at dawn, came upon the survivors of the Saudi clinging to debris. &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; rescued the 58 surviving passengers and crew, and nine bodies were recovered, with 31 missing. The survivors and bodies were put to shore at Djibouti. The crew of the &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; received a Meritorious Unit Commendation.

On 4 October 1976 USS &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; rescued seven survivors of a Finnish motor craft that sank in the Baltic Sea. The survivors were put ashore at Karlskrona, Sweden.

<doc id="521188" wikidata="Q3015406" url="?curid=521188" title="Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom">
<text>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom is a 2003 science fiction book, the first novel by Canadian author and digital-rights activist Cory Doctorow. It depicts people competing over how new technology is being used at Walt Disney World, in a post-scarcity world with an economy based on reputation. Concurrent with its publication by Tor Books, Doctorow released the entire text of the novel under a Creative Commons noncommercial license on his website, allowing the whole text of the book to be freely read and distributed without needing any further permission from him or his publisher.

The novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 2004.

==Plot summary==
This future history book takes place in the 22nd century, mostly in Walt Disney World. Disney World is run by rival adhocracies, each dedicated to providing the best experience to the park&#x27;s visitors and competing for the Whuffie the guests offer. In the post-scarcity world of the novel, Whuffie is a currency-like system that primarily measures the esteem of others, or in the case of extremely low Whuffie, their disdain. 
The story is told in first person by Julius, whose old college buddy Dan used to be one of the most popular people in the country (as measured by Whuffie). Julius and girlfriend Lil are working with the committee (called an &quot;ad hoc&quot;) that oversees the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s Liberty Square. Dan, who has hit rock bottom and lost all his Whuffie, doesn&#x27;t believe in rejuvenation and wishes to die, but not while he&#x27;s at rock bottom. He moves in with Julius and Lil in order to rebuild his life. At the park, Julius is murdered and soon refreshed. By the time he wakes up, Debra&#x27;s &quot;ad hoc&quot; group has taken control of the Hall of Presidents, and is planning to replace its old-fashioned animatronic robots with the synthetic memory imprinting of the experience of being the president for a moment. Julius believes that this rival committee had him killed as a distraction so that they could seize the Hall in the interim.

Fearing that they will next try to revamp his favorite ride, the Haunted Mansion, he resolves to take a stand against the virtualization of the park, endangering his relationship with both Lil and Dan; eventually Lil leaves Julius for Dan. Julius finally &quot;cracks&quot; when he sees his dreams turned to dust and he bashes up the attractions in the Hall of Presidents, in the process also damaging his own cranial interface to the point that he can no longer back himself up. This pushes his Whuffie to ground level when he is caught and gives Debra and her colleagues enough &quot;sympathy Whuffie&quot; to take over the Haunted Mansion, by invitation of the same fans that Julius had recruited to work in the Mansion.

Dan leaves Lil, Julius is kicked out of the &quot;ad hoc&quot; and his Whuffie hits rock bottom — low enough that others take his possessions with impunity and elevators don&#x27;t stop for him. Then comes the revelation: a few days before Dan&#x27;s planned suicide by lethal injection, Dan reveals that it was in fact he who had arranged to kill Julius, in collusion with Debra, in exchange for the Whuffie that her team could give him. Dan had asked one of his converts from his missionary days, a young girl, to do the dirty work. Debra then had herself restored from a backup made before this plan, so that she would honestly believe that she wasn&#x27;t involved. He makes this public; Debra is thrown out, Julius gets sympathy Whuffie and develops a friendly affection for his sweet young murderer. He never restores himself, because doing so would erase his memories of that entire year, his last with Dan, but lives with his damaged interface. The book is his attempt to manually document the happenings of the previous year so that, when this incarnation is eventually killed by age or accident, his restored backup will have a partial record of the transpiring events. Dan decides not to take a lethal injection, but to deadhead (putting oneself into a voluntary coma) till the heat death of the Universe.

==Characters==
*Julius (also known as Jules), the narrator of the book, is more than a century old. His childhood dream is living at Disney World (also known as &quot;The Magic Kingdom&quot;).
*Lil, age 23, with long red hair and freckles, is Jules&#x27; girlfriend. She is 15 percent of Jules&#x27; age, but outwardly the same age. She was raised in Walt Disney World.
*Dan is Jules&#x27; best male friend. He is a former missionary for the Bitchun utopia who has lost the will to live now that there are no technophobes left to convert.
*Debra is one of the old guard of Disney World and was a comrade of Lil&#x27;s parents before they went deadhead. She spent a decade in Disneyland Beijing, coding sim-rides.
*Tim is a programmer of synthetic memories.
*Tom and Rita are Lil&#x27;s parents who were &quot;members of the original &quot;ad hoc&quot; that had seized power in Walt Disney World, wresting control from a gang of wealthy former shareholders who had been operating it as their private preserve&quot;.
*Zed (also known as Zoya) is a transhuman who was married to Julius for 18 months, went crazy, and reverted to a backup from before she met Julius.

==Cultural cross references==
* Chapter five includes a description of a &quot;Snow Crash Spectacular parade&quot; based on Neal Stephenson&#x27;s book &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. 
* The book contains references to the Beatles song &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;. Julius&#x27; girlfriend leaves him for his friend Dan, just as Lil leaves Rocky Raccoon for a man named Dan in the song. At the beginning of the book, Jules and Lil sing some lyrics from the song.
*&quot;Rangy Lil&quot; is a character from the science fiction classic &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; by Robert Heinlein. The character Dan in this book says: &quot;Lil, you are one rangy cowgirl.&quot;
* Doctorow&#x27;s short story &quot;Truncat&quot; is also set in the Bitchun Society, sometime after the events of &quot;Down and Out&quot;.
* Doctorow&#x27;s short story &quot;I, Row Boat&quot;, a play on words of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot;, also appears to be set in the same universe (though more distantly future), with references to artificial uploading and downloading of intelligence, but no explicit mention of the Bitchun Society or Whuffie.
* The title is a reference to George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;.

==Licensing==
On February 12, 2004, Doctorow re-licensed his book under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike (by-nc-sa) license. Under the new license, one can now make derivative works from the book without permission, provided the license and attribution is retained with each new work and the derivatives are not used commercially. Already, fans of the book have begun Russian and Spanish translations, an audio book version, and several amusing re-arrangements of the text. Doctorow has noted that he is pleased that people are building on his work, and that he hopes that further innovations will follow.

Despite these measures, in 2007 invalid DMCA takedown notices were sent by Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) with regard to this novel. Cory Doctorow said &quot;&quot;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&quot; was the first novel released under a Creative Commons license, and I&#x27;ve spent the past four years exhorting fans to copy my work and share it. Now I&#x27;ve started to hear from readers who&#x27;ve seen this notice and concluded that I am a hypocrite who uses SFWA to send out legal threats to people who heeded my exhortation.&quot;

<doc id="521193" wikidata="Q7871493" url="?curid=521193" title="USS Manley (DD-940)">
<text>USS &quot;Manley&quot; (DD-940), named for Captain John Manley (c.1733–1793), was a built by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath in Maine. The keel was laid down on 10 February 1955.  &quot;Manley&quot; was commissioned on 1 February 1957 and sponsored by Mrs. Arleigh A. Burke, wife of then Chief of Naval Operations, the principal speaker at the commissioning ceremonies.

==History==
&quot;Manley&quot; departed Newport, Rhode Island, on 11 April for shakedown in the Caribbean. On 7 June, &quot;Manley&quot; got underway from San Juan, Puerto Rico for a goodwill tour that took her to Lisbon, Amsterdam, Kiel, and Copenhagen. The destroyer returned to the Boston Naval Shipyard on 12 July for repairs and alterations.

&quot;Manley&quot; left Boston on 22 August 1957 and sortied with an attack carrier strike force destined for a large scale NATO Fleet Exercise &quot;Strike Back.&quot; She arrived in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, on 14 September for a liberty stop. Three days later, she was underway conducting simulated war tactics as it steamed off the coast of Norway north of the Arctic Circle. After exercises with the carrier force, &quot;Manley&quot; returned to Norfolk on 24 October 1957. Later, assigned to DesDiv 41, she became the flagship for DesRon 4.

On 4 December 1957, &quot;Manley&quot; set sail for a tour with the Sixth Fleet accompanied by the &quot;Gearing&quot;, &quot;McCard&quot;, and &quot;Vogelsang&quot;. &quot;Manley&quot; practiced simulated antisubmarine warfare attacks with the squadron while en route but was diverted on 11 December through heavy seas toward the Azores where an aircraft had been reported down, &quot;Manley&quot; took her position in a futile search. In the early morning hours of 12 December, the destroyer was broadsided by a tremendous wave, killing two, injuring several others, and impacting heavy damage to the galley, radio and radar rooms when she suffered flooding. Enduring northwesterly gusts up to 80 knots, &quot;Manley&quot; battled through heavy rain squalls and mountainous seas toward Lisbon to arrive at night on 13 December for emergency treatment of the injured and repairs to the vessel. She moved to Gibraltar on the 18th and underwent voyage repairs in the Royal Dockyard of Gibraltar until 4 January 1958, then headed via Bermuda for Norfolk arriving on the 15th. Eventually, she entered the Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia for more permanent repairs. Four months later on 29 April, &quot;Manley&quot; returned to Norfolk and resumed her role as the flagship of DesRon 4.

On 6 June 1958, &quot;Manley&quot; set sail with the squadron for an Atlantic Fleet operation that included midshipmen training, implementation of the President&#x27;s people-to-people programs, and visits to foreign ports of call. She visited among other ports, Kiel, Germany and Copenhagen, Denmark, and Antwerp, Belgium while escorting the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; (CV-39).

Returning to Norfolk on 2 October, she was soon underway with the to join the Second Fleet in maneuvers off the coast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Following those operations, she took her position as plane guard for the during operations up the eastern seaboard to the Virginia Capes.

The first half of 1959 saw &quot;Manley&quot; with the Surface Antisubmarine Development Detachment at Guantanamo Bay. On 1 March, &quot;Manley&quot;&#x27;s and DesRon&#x27;s Four homeport was officially changed to Charleston, South Carolina. After six months of upkeep and maintenance, the squadron was underway for the Mediterranean and anti-submarine deployment. She participated alongside her British counterparts in &quot;Long Haul,&quot; and with the French in operation &quot;Boomerang.&quot;

After an extensive overhaul in the Charleston shipyard, &quot;Manley&quot; was again underway on 21 July 1960 for firing exercises off Culebra Island in the Caribbean. On 27 July she took her position at station number five on the Atlantic Missile Range for the test firing of a Mercury space capsule. Then, she headed eastward to Cardiff, Wales, and participated in experimental antisubmarine warfare patrols and attack team exercises en route to stateside. After completing a short stint of operations off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, &quot;Manley&quot; turned for Pollensa Bay, Majorca. Joining the USS Forrestal (CVA-59) task force at Beirut, Lebanon, she joined in Sixth Fleet maneuvers.

In November, she rendezvoused with the &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; to take part in patrols south of Hispaniola. Early in 1962, the destroyer spent a fortnight on Project Mercury operations followed up a week later underway in support of the &quot;Independence&quot; in night operations in the North Atlantic. Twice within three days her crew rescued downed pilots at night. One of those pilots, now retired Captain Bill Brandel of Fairfax, Virginia, appeared at the Capitol 2001 Reunion on Sunday, 28 October 2001, nearly thirty years later, to extend his gratitude to several of those who participated in his rescue.

On 28 September 1962, &quot;Manley&quot; headed for Guantanamo Bay for refresher training and rescued a downed helicopter pilot. She spent most of October and November operating in the waters of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. While returning home, the destroyer again came to the rescue of three men of yacht, Avian, adrift in the Atlantic.

Late in January 1963, she sailed to the Caribbean for operation &quot;Springboard &#x27;63.&quot; After ASW exercises with the aircraft carrier , joint Canadian-American ASW exercises took her to Halifax, Nova Scotia. In October, &quot;Manley&quot; again departed for a Mediterranean deployment. She was honored to be selected as SIXTH Fleet&#x27;s flagship during a three-day visit to Tunis. In December, she saw operations with the Middle East Force. On 13 January 1964, &quot;Manley&quot; dispatched her then Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander Joseph E. Murray, Jr. to negotiate with armed rebels in Zanzibar. Along with a small band of sailors, Murray successfully walked away with 91 American citizens held hostages by the guerrillas.

Following routine upkeep in Charleston, she resumed operations off the Atlantic coast in May and on 6 January 1965 returned to the Mediterranean, representing the United States during the tenth anniversary celebrations of CENTO in Iskenderum, Turkey. During her homeward voyage, &quot;Manley&quot; spotted the collision of &quot;Kaskaskia&quot; and the Liberian tanker SS &quot;World Bond&quot; near St. Helena. &quot;Manley&quot; rescued 23 &quot;World Bond&quot; passengers and crew from the murky waters. Her emergency teams fought on board fires and flooding and saved the ship.

On 9 August, &quot;Manley&quot; took her recovery station for the space flight of Gemini V. For the next year, she operated in various combat scenarios off the Carolina coasts in preparation for then unknown operations in Southeast Asia. Departing Charleston on 5 October 1966, she joined DesRon 20 at Gitmo, and soon afterwards set her bow for Vietnam. En route, she assisted the ill captain of the Greek merchant ship, &quot;Marcetta&quot;. On 21 November, &quot;Manley&quot; relieved in Da Nang as a unit of TU 70.8.9, a gunfire support group of the Seventh Fleet. &quot;Manley&quot; provided distinguished support of the ground forces until 7 December when a powder case ignited in the breech of mount 51, her forward gun mount. The resulting fire and explosion tore the mount apart and endangered the magazines. Damage control snuffed out the blaze before extensive damage occurred. The casualties were evacuated by helicopter and the destroyer steamed to Da Nang to disembark the visiting Senator Henry M. Jackson.

After Subic Bay repairs, &quot;Manley&quot; joined up with and in the Gulf of Tonkin and operated there until assigned to TG 77.4 for ASW work with . Awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for sustained meritorious service in operations against the enemy during her deployment in Southeast Asia, &quot;Manley&quot; returned to Charleston in May 1967.

After a brief stay in her homeport, &quot;Manley&quot; again departed for the Western Pacific and combat duty in September. Her second Vietnam engagement was to last eight and one-half months until she returned to Charleston in June 1968.

The destroyer was decommissioned on 31 January 1970 to undergo prolong antisubmarine warfare modernization at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Extensive improvements to sensors, weaponry, communications, and crew habitability were accomplished and on 19 April 1971, she was recommissioned and joined CruDesFlot 4 in Norfolk. Following her shakedown deployment in Guantanamo in the spring of &#x27;72, &quot;Manley&quot; joined DesRon 12 and took part in the program to forward deploy ships in overseas homeports. DesRon 12 and &quot;Manley&quot; entered their new homeport, Athens, Greece, on 1 September 1972. During the next thirty months, she was called upon frequently to participate in speed contingency exercises: the October 1973 Arab-Israeli and Cyprus crisis of 1974. &quot;Manley&quot; became the first United States warship to visit İzmir, Turkey in December 1973. On 22 July 1975, the destroyer headed for a scheduled upkeep and maintenance in Philadelphia and in December 1976, was home ported to Mayport, Florida.

After finishing refresher training in March 1977, she commenced operations as a unit of the Second Fleet followed by a Sixth Fleet deployment from November 1977 until July 1978. Her operating cycle was continued with another Med and Northern Europe run.

On 8 April 1979 while at Mayport, a fire broke out in the forward boiler room during preparation to get underway. Twelve men were injured of which one later died. The repair cost was estimated at $75 million. On 1 October 1979, the crew became designated &quot;Blue Noses&quot; when they crossed the Arctic Circle.

With an increasing naval presence in the Caribbean Sea, the destroyer operated throughout the area visiting Curaçao, Antilles, Limón, Costa Rica, and Santo Tomas de Castilla. In 1980, she departed Mayport for overhaul in Boston. Following a successful refit and sea trials, &quot;Manley&quot; was assigned to Newport, Rhode Island, and conducted workup ops in the Narragansett area preparing for REFTRA in Guantanamo Bay.

==Fate==
From 3 April to 3 May, she conducted FEDEX(?) operations in and around Puerto Rico. On 8 June 1982, the USS &quot;Manley&quot; departed for what was to be her last cruise. She visited all of the Med ports, assisted in evacuation of civilians from Beirut, Lebanon, during terrorist activities, and transited the Indian Ocean arriving after fifty days at sea in Karachi, Pakistan. From 16 October until 24 November, she joined in MidEastFor exercises. At long last, the Lady headed home arriving on 22 December in Newport to commence decommissioning. On 4 March 1983, the USS &quot;Manley&quot; (DD-940) was struck for the Navy&#x27;s active rolls.

When the Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works went bankrupt in the early nineties she was resold to N. R. Acquisition Incorporated of New York City by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court and scrapped by Wilmington Resources of Wilmington in North Carolina.

<doc id="521195" wikidata="Q4656603" url="?curid=521195" title="A Drug Against War">
<text>&quot;A Drug Against War&quot; is a song by industrial rock band KMFDM, taken from their 1993 album &quot;Angst&quot;. It was released as a single prior to the album. A music video, featuring animated depictions of the band&#x27;s previous album covers and singles, was made for the single, and was subsequently shown on the MTV cartoon &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot; on 11 July 1994. It was re-released as a 7&quot; in 2009. On 16 December 2010 it was made available as a downloadable song for the game &quot;Rock Band&quot;. In late 2011, the band released a new version of the song called &quot;A Drug Against Wall Street&quot;, with lyrics in support of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and made it available for free download from their site.

== Song ==
The song includes several militaristic samples. The primary one, in which someone calls for the bombing of enemy troops, comes from a live news broadcast about the Gulf War that Konietzko taped. The lyrics mix social criticism with regular reference to war, and the instruments simulate the sounds of missiles and gunfire. Eventually, the martial symbolism becomes so overt and over-the-top that academic S. Alexander Reed identifies this as a sign that it is meant satirically. Reed compares these militaristic themes to the &quot;war on drugs&quot;, which is ironically referenced in the song&#x27;s title and turned into an anti-war motto. According to Reed, the song&#x27;s ironic use of militarism marks it as yet another social ill to be criticized.

==Critical reception==
Andy Hinds, in the 2002 book &quot;All Music Guide to Rock&quot;, called the song KMFDM&#x27;s most over the top moment to date. Ten years after its release, Brad Filicky of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; said &quot;A Drug Against War&quot; was one of the most potent speed metal songs ever. Joshua Landau of Allmusic said that while the song was &quot;one of the best introductions to KMFDM&#x27;s antagonistic guitars and viewpoints&quot;, the four track single was &quot;only of interest to serious fans&quot;.

&quot;A Drug Against War&quot; was ranked No. 47 on &quot;COMA Music Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 101 Greatest Industrial Songs of All Time.

<doc id="521198" wikidata="Q7868972" url="?curid=521198" title="USS Du Pont (DD-941)">
<text>USS &quot;Du Pont&quot; (DD-941), named for Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont USN (1803–1865), was a built by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath in Maine and launched by Mrs. H. B. Du Pont, great-great-grandniece of Rear Admiral Du Pont; and commissioned 1 July 1957, Commander W. J. Maddocks in command.

==History==
From 6 to 31 July 1958 &quot;Du Pont&quot; served on a midshipman cruise and antisubmarine exercises in the Atlantic, duty broken by a visit to New York. &quot;Du Pont&quot; sailed 2 September for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, during which she participated in highly realistic air defense and antisubmarine warfare problems. She returned to Norfolk 12 March 1959, to prepare for Operation &quot;Inland Seas,&quot; the historic first passage of a naval task force into the Great Lakes through the Saint Lawrence Seaway. She escorted the royal yacht with Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom embarked during the dedicatory ceremonies on 26 June.

&quot;Du Pont&quot; crossed the Atlantic in August and September 1959, visiting Southampton, England, after serving as plane guard for the transatlantic flight of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. On 28 January 1960 &quot;Du Pont&quot; sailed from Norfolk for a second tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, returning on 31 August for an overhaul in the Naval Shipyard where she remained through the end of 1960.

Fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea, operations along the Atlantic Coast, and enforcing the quarantine during the Cuban Missile Crisis carried &quot;Du Pont&quot; to April 1963 when she served as the command ship during the search for the submarine that foundered off Boston on 10 April. She finished 1963 as the only destroyer in the Atlantic Fleet to win four successive &quot;E&quot;s in Engineering. Her fifth Mediterranean cruise began in November and continued into 1964.

After another Mediterranean deployment, she was the first ship to reach the Gemini 5 space capsule after it landed, and her crew stood by to ensure that both astronauts and capsule were recovered safely. She was also the first vessel ever to recover the booster section of a space shot launch rocket, which she carried back to Norfolk lashed to her fantail. While in Santo Domingo during the Dominican Republic crisis, &quot;Du Pont&quot; earned a golden &quot;E&quot; to commemorate her sixth consecutive Engineering &#x27;E&#x27;. Operations with the Sixth Fleet and NATO forces took up the first half of 1966, followed by a Caribbean cruise and the award of her seventh Engineering &#x27;E&#x27;, an unprecedented feat.

&quot;Du Pont&quot;″s first Vietnam deployment began in August 1967 on the gun line in support of U.S. Marines fighting at the Demilitarized Zone. Under constant threat from enemy shore batteries, her gunners shelled enemy positions day and night. On 28 August, the enemy fired on the destroyer , which was between &quot;Du Pont&quot; and the beach. As &quot;Robison&quot; maneuvered to seaward, &quot;Du Pont&quot; returned fire, immediately replacing it as a target for some twenty rounds. One shell found its target, hitting the Mount 52 gun. The burst sent shrapnel into the mount and down through the superstructure to the after deckhouse, killing FN Frank L. Ballant and wounding eight others. Despite the casualties to men and ship, &quot;Du Pont&quot; continued on station for another two weeks before heading for Subic Bay and repairs. Under fire once more when she returned to the gun line on 10 October, she successfully avoided being hit. On 10 November, the eight men wounded on 28 August received Purple Heart medals, and two days later, the ship left for her last trip to the gun line. At the end of seventy-five days in combat, &quot;Du Pont&quot;″s 5-inch guns had fired 20,000 rounds. Returning to Norfolk in January 1968, she went into dry dock for repairs followed by operations with the Apollo recovery force, exercises in the Caribbean, and midshipman training. By summer&#x27;s end, her engineering department had racked up its ninth departmental excellence award.

Back in the Far East on 10 October 1968, she began twenty-six days on the gun line supporting SEAL reconnaissance teams and ARVN units in the Mekong Delta. Later in the Gulf of Siam, she fired on a Vietcong-held island, supported a swift boat sweep up the Ông Đốc River estuary, and provided gun fire support in the I Corps area and around Da Nang. In mid-December, her guns covered an amphibious landing to the south.

Returning to combat in January, her gunners supported the 1st Marine Division at Da Nang, covered a four-day amphibious landing to the south, and then again shelled enemy positions around Da Nang and in the Mekong River Delta. When she left Vietnam that spring, &quot;Du Pont&quot;″s guns had fired 30,000 rounds, damaging or destroying more than 730 military structures, and 131 small craft, not to mention causing multiple fires and explosions. Following her return to Norfolk, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard and decommissioned on 23 May 1969 for antisubmarine warfare modernization.

Recommissioned on 9 May 1970, she returned to Norfolk and in April 1971, began antisubmarine warfare and routine operations along the Atlantic Coast, in the Caribbean, and the Mediterranean. In 1972, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. In 1979, &quot;Du Pont&quot; was relocated to the Bethlehem Steel Works Ship Yard in Hoboken, New Jersey, where the destroyer underwent a major refit. In 1980, the ship got underway and was attached to Comdesron 2, under the command of Cmdr. Harlan K. Ullman.

Following the refit, the ship sailed for its home port of Norfolk, Virginia, before going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Under Cmdr. Ullman&#x27;s command, the crew participated in two weeks of refresher training, simulating wartime conditions. The crew of &quot;Du Pont&quot; received three of the Battle &quot;E&#x27;s&quot;.
In 1981, &quot;Du Pont&quot; went to the Middle East, sailing through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea then to the Persian Gulf. The ship was assigned to the battle group, remaining on patrol in the Persian Gulf following the release of American hostages held in Iran. The ship was continually on alert, as Iranian P-3 Orions, originally supplied by the United States, would survey the gulf to track U.S. ship movements.

In 1982, &quot;Du Pont&quot; was assigned to assist Israel, after the confrontation took place between Israeli forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The ship remained off the coast of Beirut for nearly 100 days, lending naval gunfire support. &quot;Du Pont&quot; was stationed off the coast of Lebanon longer than any other U.S. Navy ship.

==Fate==
&quot;Du Pont&quot; was decommissioned on 4 March 1983 and sold for scrap on 11 December 1992 to the Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works.

<doc id="521199" wikidata="Q4027165" url="?curid=521199" title="Angst (KMFDM album)">
<text>Angst is the sixth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on 12 October 1993 by Wax Trax! Records.

==Background==
Bandmates Sascha Konietzko and En Esch began working together again after splitting up during the recording of their previous album, &quot;Money&quot;. Konietzko had moved to Seattle in 1993, while Esch had moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. &quot;Angst&quot; was the first album the band recorded in America with new engineer Chris Shepard, after recording their first six albums in Hamburg, the previous four of which had all been engineered by Blank Fontana. &quot;Angst&quot; also marked the first appearance of steel guitarist Mark Durante, whose presence made a noticeable impact on the band&#x27;s sound, moving it towards a more guitar-driven style. Dutch vocalist Dorona Alberti made her mark on the album as well, singing on half the songs, including lead vocals on &quot;The Problem&quot;.
The song &quot;A Hole in the Wall&quot; lyrically is a direct to-English translation of the German lyrics to the song &quot;Liebeslied&quot; from the recently pulled version of their 1990 offering &#x27;Naïve (album)&#x27;.

==Production==
After very limited participation on &quot;Money&quot;, Esch had a much stronger hand in the songwriting and recording of &quot;Angst&quot;, and commented after its release, &quot;We&#x27;ve tried to involve guitar players, we tried to be like a real band, especially in the creative kind of aspect.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Angst&quot; was released on 13 October 1993. Unlike previous albums, &quot;Angst&quot; had a more rock-oriented sound, so the marketing strategy of Wax Trax!/TVT changed. TVT director of sales and marketing Paul Burgess said, &quot;We decided to work them not like a typical dance-rock artist, but like a serious rock band, and it has crossed over to metal and commercial alternative this time.&quot; KMFDM embarked on the Angstfest Tour in support of the album in April and May 1994. In addition to the studio lineup, guitarist Mike Jensen was brought along for the live shows to duplicate the heavy sound of the album. This led to stage performances that included up to four guitarists playing at once.

The album had sold 20,000 copies by February 1994, and went on to sell more than 100,000 copies by October 1995. A digitally remastered reissue of &quot;Angst&quot; was released by Metropolis Records on 21 November 2006.

==Reception==

Andy Hinds of Allmusic said KMFDM had reached their full potential on the album. He called &quot;A Drug Against War&quot; &quot;the band&#x27;s most over-the-top moment to date&quot; and thought &quot;Sucks&quot; was funny and irreverent. He concluded by calling &quot;Angst&quot; a great album for KMFDM newcomers. Ira Robbins called &quot;Angst&quot; &quot;the fulfillment of Money&#x27;s promise, a meld of pop choruses, metal guitar riffs and industrial machine-beats&quot;. Colin Larkin said &quot;Angst&quot; &quot;perfected the band&#x27;s aggressive fusion of pounding electro rhythms and screeching guitars.&quot; &quot;Angst&quot; was given a Silver Salute by &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; in 2003, with Brad Filicky saying, &quot;KMFDM managed to make people laugh, even as they were checking under their beds for monsters and finding the inspiration to plug their guitars into a MIDI unit.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Bigelow&quot; (DD-942) was a in the United States Navy. The ship was named for Watertender Second Class Elmer Charles Bigelow (1920–1945), who was killed in action extinguishing a magazine fire while serving on board during action against enemy Japanese forces off Corregidor in the Philippines on 14 February 1945. Bigelow was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

&quot;Bigelow&quot; was built by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath in Maine. The ship was launched by Mrs. Verna B. Perry, mother of Elmer C. Bigelow.

&quot;Bigelow&quot; was part of Combined Task Group CTG 136.1.1 tasked with blockading Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. &quot;Bigelow&quot; received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for participating from 24 October 1962 to 21 November 1962.

&quot;Bigelow&quot; saw extensive service in the Vietnam War and also served as a NASA recovery ship for the Mercury and Gemini III programs.

While operating off Vietnam on 20 April 1967, an explosion in a gun mount injured six sailors, 1 killed.

&quot;Bigelow&quot; served as a test platform for Phalanx CIWS in 1977. The mount was installed just aft of the aft radar gun director.

Glenn R. Brindel, commanding officer of during the 1987 missile attack, was executive officer of &quot;Bigelow&quot; from 1978 to 1980.

==Fate==
&quot;Bigelow&quot; decommissioned 5 November 1982.

She was sold for scrap to the Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 11 December 1992. When the Fore River Shipyard went bankrupt she was resold to N. R. Acquisition Incorporated of New York City by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court. She was re-acquired by the Navy for disposition as a target ship, stricken 1 June 1990 and was &quot;Disposed of in support of Fleet training exercise&quot; (presumably sunk as a gunnery target) on or before 2 April 2003.

<doc id="521202" wikidata="Q1078399" url="?curid=521202" title="USS Arleigh Burke">
<text>USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; (DDG-51), named for Admiral Arleigh A. Burke, USN (1901–1996), is the lead ship of the Aegis guided missile destroyer. She is of the Flight I variant. She was laid down by the Bath Iron Works company at Bath, Maine, on 6 December 1988; launched on 16 September 1989; and commissioned on 4 July 1991. 

&quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;″s designers incorporated many lessons learned by the Royal Navy during the Falklands campaign and from the guided-missile cruisers. The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers were becoming too expensive to continue building and too difficult to upgrade. &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was the first modern destroyer designed with features meant to lower its radar cross-section, which improves a ship&#x27;s ability to evade radar detection. She also used a slightly downgraded version of the Aegis Combat System, which allows for launching, tracking, and evading missiles simultaneously. Her all-steel construction provides good protection for her superstructure, while her Collective Protection System allows her to operate in environments contaminated by chemical, biological, or radiological materials.

==History==

Before &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was commissioned, the Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force was involved in the initial phases of testing. New systems, operated by fleet sailors ashore, were examined at land-based test facilities. The combat systems testing took place at the Combat System Engineering Development Site in Moorestown, New Jersey. The propulsion plant testing occurred at the Gas Turbine Ship Land-Based Engineering Site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These test results supported the acquisition decision to begin limited production of the ship class.

The ship was launched on 16 September 1989 by Mrs. Roberta (Gorsuch) Burke. Admiral Burke was present in person at her commissioning ceremony on 4 July, which was held on the waterfront in downtown Norfolk, Virginia.

After being commissioned and throughout 1992, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; conducted extensive testing at sea. As is often the case with new ship classes, U.S. Navy officers and shipyard engineers encountered a number of problems with some shipboard systems that required the attention of the warship&#x27;s design and production agencies. An additional phase of testing was added to verify the effectiveness of the modifications made to these systems—modifications incorporated into later destroyers of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class.

Following her initial operational testing, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea in 1993, serving as the &quot;Green Crown&quot; during Operation Provide Promise. During her second deployment in 1995, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; steamed in the Mediterranean Sea as the &quot;Red Crown&quot; in support of the No-Fly Zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. During her third cruise, in 1998, she steamed in the Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea, Red Sea, and Black Sea, as a participant in numerous American and Allied exercises. During her fourth cruise in 2000–2001, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; saw service in the Mediterranean and Red Seas and in the Persian Gulf, enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq and conducting exercises with allied naval partners.

On her fifth deployment in 2003, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; and the other units of the -led carrier battle group participated in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this wartime cruise, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; fired Tomahawk missile strikes against targets in Iraq, escorted merchant ships and naval auxiliaries through geographic choke points, and carried out &quot;leadership interdiction&quot; operations in the northern Arabian Sea. She also undertook counter-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden. This cruise, which lasted from January through June 2003, saw &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; at sea over 92 percent of the time.

In March 2003, she was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 2.

&quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; has earned one Navy Unit Commendation, three Meritorious Unit Commendations, three Battle Efficiency E Awards, the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Kuwait Liberation Medal, and five Sea Service Deployment Ribbons.

As a member of Destroyer Squadron 22, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; operated with the Carrier Strike Group under the direction of the Commander, Carrier Group 2.

In May 2007, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; ran what the Navy called a &quot;soft aground&quot; off Cape Henry Light at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. Her captain, Commander Esther J. McClure, was relieved of her command shortly thereafter as a result of a &quot;loss of confidence in her ability to command&quot;.

In October 2007, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was involved in anti-pirate operations in Somalia.

In 2009, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was deployed to the eastern coast of Africa in support of AFRICOM&#x27;s Africa Partnership Station. The ship represented the United States during a port visit to the island nation of Seychelles where they played a role in securing a status of forces agreement between the two countries.

In August 2010, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; entered the BAE Systems Ship Repair shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia for DDG Modernization, a program to upgrade the ship&#x27;s systems and to extend the service life to 40 years.

On 23 September 2014, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; took part in the 2014 military intervention against ISIS, firing Tomahawk missiles on targets in Syria while the ship was in the Red Sea.

In 2018, the ship made two three-month overseas deployments, returning to Norfolk, Virginia, between cruises.

In 2019, she entered General Dynamics NASSCO&#x27;s shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia, for continued work towards modernization for ballistic missile defense.

In March 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; transited the Atlantic Ocean and conducted a home port shift to Rota, Spain, joining the Forward Deployed Naval Forces in Europe as part of Destroyer Squadron 60. Prior to the port shift, she received extensive upgrades, including Aegis Baseline 9 for BMD capability, as well as replacing her aft Phalanx CIWS with a SeaRAM CIWS. The ship crossed the Arctic Circle in May 2021.

The crew began their first forward-deployed patrol in August 2021, returning in December 2021. During 2021, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; sailed more than 44,000 miles, circumnavigated Europe, and executed operations in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Barents Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Arctic Ocean. Port calls included Tallinn, Estonia; Helsinki, Finland; Gdynia, Poland; Varna, Bulgaria; Constanta, Romania; and Golcuk, Turkey.

In March 2022, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was selected as the 2021 Battle E Winner for Destroyer Squadron 60. The Battle &quot;E&quot; recognizes the top ship in each squadron and is awarded for demonstrating sustained superior performance, operational effectiveness, and continuous readiness.

In April 2022, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; completed the largest maintenance availability ever conducted in Rota, Spain, and then commenced her second forward-deployed patrol in May 2022.

On 9 July 2022, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; arrived in Riga for a scheduled port visit.

On 13–14 April 2024, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; and shot down at least six Iranian ballistic missiles during the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel.

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
The Shield outlined in blue and gold stands for the achievements in battle of Admiral Burke against the naval power of Japan. The fist and mace symbolize the offensive and defensive power of the new destroyer. The mace, also a symbol of authority, represents Admiral Burke&#x27;s service as Chief of Naval Operations. It also refers to Admiral Marc Mitscher, an influential figure and mentor for whom Admiral Burke served as chief of staff. Admiral Burke&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 23, represented by the border of 23 ovals, was the only United States Destroyer Squadron awarded a Presidential Unit Citation, signified by the canton of blue, yellow, and red. The ovals also refer to the year 1923, in which Midshipman Burke graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Twenty-three also reflects Admiral Burke&#x27;s distinguished service on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations as (OP-23).

The mounted figure of Saint George recalls Admiral Burke&#x27;s celebrated victory in the Battle of Cape St. George over Japanese naval forces. His mantle bears a gold cross for the Navy Cross awarded to the admiral. The birch branch on the helmet represents Admiral Burke himself, a reference to his name derived from his Scandinavian heritage.

The red sea dragon symbolizes Japanese naval power assaulted by forces under Captain Burke&#x27;s command. It is gorged with the two gold stars he was awarded for outstanding service. The lance impaling the dragon signifies ordnance on target. The capabilities of the new destroyer, the most powerful and survivable ever built, are signified by the full armor and equipment of the warrior Saint George. The admiral&#x27;s nickname &quot;31-Knot Burke&quot; is recalled by the number &quot;31&quot; on the horse.

The motto of the ship is &quot;Fast and Feared&quot;. The ship&#x27;s crest was designed by John Sproston of the Institute of Heraldry following a personal interview with Admiral Burke. The crest can also be found on a United States Postal Service postage stamp honoring Admiral Burke that was issued in 2010.

<doc id="521205" wikidata="Q1137653" url="?curid=521205" title="Japanese battleship Fusō">
<text>was the lead ship of the two dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Launched in 1914 and commissioned in 1915, she initially patrolled off the coast of China, playing no part in World War I. In 1923, she assisted survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake.

&quot;Fusō&quot; was modernized in 1930–1935 and again in 1937–1941, with improvements to her armor and propulsion machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style. Nonetheless, she was still hampered by slow speed and outclassed by newer Japanese battleships at the beginning of World War II, and played auxiliary roles for most of the war.

&quot;Fusō&quot; was part of Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. She was sunk in the early hours of 25 October 1944 by torpedoes and naval gunfire during the Battle of Surigao Strait. Some reports claimed &quot;Fusō&quot; broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour; according to survivors&#x27; accounts, however, the ship sank after 40 minutes of flooding and caught fire when her fuel bunkers spilled open. Of the few dozen crewmen who escaped, only 10 survived to return to Japan.

==Description==

The ship had a length of between perpendiculars and overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . &quot;Fusō&quot; displaced at standard load and at full load. Her crew consisted of 1,198 officers and enlisted men in 1915 and 1,396 in 1935. During World War II, the crew probably totalled around 1,800–1,900 men.

During the ship&#x27;s first modernization during 1930–1933, her forward superstructure was enlarged with multiple platforms added to her tripod foremast. Her rear superstructure was rebuilt to accommodate mounts for anti-aircraft (AA) guns and additional fire-control directors. &quot;Fusō&quot; was also given torpedo bulges to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment. During the second phase of her first reconstruction in 1934–1935, &quot;Fusō&quot;″s torpedo bulge was enlarged and her stern was lengthened by . These changes increased her overall length to , her beam to and her draft to . Her displacement increased by nearly to at deep load.

===Propulsion===
The ship had two sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines, each of which drove two propeller shafts. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 24 Miyahara-type water-tube boilers, each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil. &quot;Fusō&quot; had a stowage capacity of of coal and of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of . The ship exceeded her design speed of during her sea trials, reaching at .

During her first modernization, the Miyahara boilers were replaced by six new Kampon oil-fired boilers fitted in the former aft boiler room, and the forward funnel was removed. The Brown-Curtis turbines were replaced by four geared Kanpon turbines with a designed output of . During her 1933 trials, &quot;Fusō&quot; reached a top speed of from . The fuel storage of the ship was increased to a total of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at a speed of .

===Armament===

The twelve 45-caliber 14-inch guns of &quot;Fusō&quot; were mounted in six twin-gun turrets, numbered one through six from front to rear, each with an elevation range of −5 to +30 degrees. The turrets were arranged in an uncommon 2-1-1-2 style with superfiring pairs of turrets fore and aft; the middle turrets were not superfiring, and had a funnel between them. The main guns and their turrets were modernized during the ship&#x27;s 1930 reconstruction; the elevation of the main guns was increased to +43 degrees, increasing their maximum range from . Initially, the guns could fire at a rate of 1.5 rounds per minute, and this was also improved during her first modernization. The orientation of Turret No. 3 was reversed during the modernization; it now faced forward.

Originally, &quot;Fusō&quot; was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50-caliber six-inch 41st Year Type guns mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull. The gun had a maximum range of and fired at a rate of up to six shots per minute. She was fitted with five 40-caliber three-inch (76 mm) AA guns in 1918. The high-angle guns were in single mounts on both sides of the forward superstructure and both sides of the second funnel, as well as on the port side of the aft superstructure. These guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a shell at a rate of 13 to 20 rounds per minute to a maximum height of . The ship was also fitted with six submerged torpedo tubes, three on each broadside.

During the first phase of &quot;Fusō&quot;″s modernization of the early 1930s, all five three-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 40-caliber 127-millimeter dual-purpose guns, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. At this time, the ship was also provided with four quadruple mounts for the license-built Type 93 13.2 mm machine guns, two on the pagoda mast and one on each side of the funnel. The maximum range of these guns was , but the effective range against aircraft was only . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

The improvements made during the first reconstruction increased &quot;Fusō&quot;″s draft by , soaking the two foremost six-inch guns, so they were removed during the first phase of the ship&#x27;s second modernization in 1937 and 1938. During this same phase, the Type 93 machine guns were replaced by eight 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in twin-gun mounts. Four of these mounts were fitted on the forward superstructure, one on each side of the funnel and two on the rear superstructure. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;. The configuration of the AA guns varied significantly; in July 1943, 17 single and two twin-mounts were added for a total of 37. In July 1944, the ship was fitted with additional AA guns: 23 single, six twin and eight triple-mounts, for a total of 95 in her final configuration. These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.

===Armor===
The ship&#x27;s waterline armor belt was thick; below it was a strake of armor. The deck armor ranged in thickness from . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick, while the casemates of the 152 mm guns were protected by 152 mm armor plates. The sides of the conning tower were thick. The vessel contained 737 watertight compartments (574 underneath the armor deck, 163 above) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage.

During her first reconstruction &quot;Fusō&quot;″s armor was substantially upgraded. The deck armor was increased to a maximum thickness of . A longitudinal bulkhead of of high-tensile steel was added to improve underwater protection.

===Aircraft===
&quot;Fusō&quot; was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1924. During the first phase of her first modernization, a catapult was fitted on the roof of Turret No. 3 and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. &quot;Fusō&quot;″s ability to operate her aircraft was greatly improved during the second phase of her second modernization in 1940–41 when the aircraft handling equipment was moved to the stern and a new catapult was installed. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns from 1942 on.

===Fire control and sensors===
When completed in 1915, &quot;Fusō&quot; had two and two rangefinders in her forward superstructure, a rangefinder on the roof of Turret No. 2, and 4.5-meter rangefinders in Turrets 3, 4, and 5. In late 1917 a fire-control director was installed on a platform on the foremast. The 4.5-meter rangefinders were replaced by instruments in 1923. During the ship&#x27;s first modernization, four directors for the 12.7 mm AA guns were added, one each on each side of the fore and aft superstructures, and an eight-meter rangefinder was installed at the top of the pagoda mast. This was replaced by a rangefinder during 1938. At this same time, the two 3.5-meter rangefinders on the forward superstructure were replaced by directors for the 25 mm AA guns. Additional 25 mm directors were installed on platforms on each side of the funnel.

While in drydock in July 1943, Type 21 air search radar was installed on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on the funnel. &quot;Fusō&quot; was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel.

==Construction and service==

Given a classical name for Japan, &quot;Fusō&quot; was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 11 March 1912 and launched on 28 March 1914. She was commissioned on 8 November 1915 and assigned to the 1st Division, of the 1st Fleet on 13 December under the command of Captain Kōzō Satō. The ship did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the Central Powers in Asia by the time she was completed; she patrolled off the coast of China during that time. The ship served as the flagship of the 1st Division during 1917 and 1918. During the ship&#x27;s period in reserve in 1918, five 76.2 mm anti-aircraft guns were installed. She aided survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake between 9 and 22 September 1923. Captain Mitsumasa Yonai assumed command on 1 July 1924 and was relieved on 1 November by Captain Sankichi Takahashi. In the 1920s, &quot;Fusō&quot; conducted training off the coast of China and was often placed in reserve.
The first phase of the ship&#x27;s first modernization began on 12 April 1930 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal; machinery was replaced, armor was reinforced, and torpedo bulges were fitted. &quot;Fusō&quot; arrived on 26 September 1932 at Kure Naval Arsenal, where her armament was upgraded and her torpedo tubes were removed. Her sea trials began on 12 May 1933, and the second phase of her modernization began less than a year later. The ship&#x27;s stern was lengthened and work was completed in March 1935. Captain Jinichi Kusaka was assigned command from November 1935 to December 1936. After sporadic use for training for the next two years, &quot;Fusō&quot; was assigned as a training ship in 1936 and 1937.

&quot;Fusō&quot; began the first phase of her second modernization on 26 February 1937, and Captain Hiroaki Abe assumed command on 1 December. He was relieved by Captain Ruitaro Fujita on 1 April 1938, the day after this phase of her modernization was completed. The ship was again assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet on 15 November. She briefly operated in Chinese waters in early 1939 before the second phase of her second modernization began on 12 December 1940. This was completed on 10 April 1941, and &quot;Fusō&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet. Captain Mitsuo Kinoshita assumed command on 15 September, when the division consisted of the two &quot;Fusō&quot;-class and the two s.

===World War II===
On 10 April 1941, &quot;Fusō&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, the division, reinforced by the battleships and and the light carrier , sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. On 21 February 1942, the ship returned to the shipyard at Kure to replace her gun barrels, departing on 25 February. Together with the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division, she pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942.

&quot;Fusō&quot; and the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division set sail on 28 May 1942 with the Aleutian Support Group at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI). Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the division was composed of Japan&#x27;s four oldest battleships, including &quot;Fusō&quot;, accompanied by two light cruisers, 12 destroyers, and two oilers. Official records do not show the division as part of the larger Midway operation, known as Operation AL; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed.

On 14 June, &quot;Fusō&quot; returned to Yokosuka and arrived back at Hashirajima on 24 June. In an effort to replace the aircraft carriers lost at the Battle of Midway, the navy made plans to convert the two &quot;Fusō&quot;-class ships to hybrid battleship-carriers, but the two &quot;Ise&quot;-class battleships were chosen instead. The ship was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima, Hiroshima, for use as a training ship between 15 November 1942 and 15 January 1943. Captain Keizō Komura assumed command on 5 December, and was relieved by Captain Nobumichi Tsuruoka on 1 June the next year. Seven days later, &quot;Fusō&quot; rescued 353 survivors from &quot;Mutsu&quot; when that ship exploded at Hashirajima.

Between 18 and 24 July 1943, the ship was at the Kure drydock for fitting of radar and additional 25 mm AA guns. &quot;Fusō&quot; sailed from the Inland Sea on 18 August for Truk Naval Base, carrying supplies, and arrived five days later. The Japanese had intercepted American radio traffic that suggested an attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, &quot;Fusō&quot; and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack. The fleet arrived on the 19th, departed four days later, and arrived back at Truk on 26 October.
On 1 February 1944, &quot;Fusō&quot; departed Truk with &quot;Nagato&quot; to avoid an American air raid, and arrived at Palau on 4 February. They left on 16 February to escape another air raid. The ships arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island, and &quot;Fusō&quot; was employed there as a training ship. A week later, Captain Masami Ban relieved Tsuruoka. The ship was refitted at Singapore between 13 and 27 April, and returned to Lingga. She was transferred to Tawi-Tawi on 11 May and provided cover for the convoy that failed to reinforce Biak Island at the end of the month. &quot;Fusō&quot; transferred to Tarakan Island off Borneo to refuel in early July before returning to Japan and escaping an attack by the submarine . In early August at Kure, she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns. &quot;Fusō&quot; and her sister ship were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the 2nd Fleet on 10 September, and &quot;Fusō&quot; became the flagship of the division under the command of Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura on 23 September. They departed Kure on 23 September for Lingga, escaping an attack by the submarine the next day, and arrived on 4 October, where Nishimura transferred his flag to &quot;Yamashiro&quot;. The ships then transferred to Brunei to refuel in preparation for Operation &quot;Shō-Gō&quot;, the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the invasion of Leyte.

====Battle of Surigao Strait====
Commanded by Rear Admiral Masami Ban, &quot;Fusō&quot; left Brunei at 15:30 on 22 October 1944 as part of Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force, heading east into the Sulu Sea and then northeast into the Mindanao Sea. 

At 09:08 on 24 October, &quot;Fusō&quot;, &quot;Yamashiro&quot;, and the heavy cruiser &quot;Mogami&quot; spotted a group of 27 planes, including Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers escorted by Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters from the carrier . A bomb from one of them destroyed the catapult and both floatplanes. Another bomb hit the ship near Turret No. 2 and penetrated the decks, killing everyone in No. 1 secondary battery; the ship began to list 2 degrees to starboard. Early the next morning, &quot;Fusō&quot; opened fire around 01:05 after a shape was spotted off the port bow; it turned out to be &quot;Mogami&quot;; &quot;Fusō&quot;″s fire killed three sailors in that ship&#x27;s sick bay.

Intending to join Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s fleet in Leyte Gulf, Nishimura&#x27;s flotilla passed west of Mindanao Island into Surigao Strait, where it met a large force of battleships and cruisers lying in wait. The Battle of Surigao Strait became the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

Nishimura&#x27;s ships managed to repel waves of attacks from PT boats, but then was subjected to devastating torpedo attacks from the American destroyers deployed on both sides of their axis of advance. Before &quot;Fusō&quot; could reach the main American battle line, one or two torpedoes, possibly fired by the destroyer , hit &quot;Fusō&quot; amidships on the starboard side at 03:09 on the 25th; she listed to starboard, slowed down, and fell out of formation. Some Japanese and American eyewitnesses later claimed &quot;Fusō&quot; broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour, but they specifically mentioned only the size of the fire on the water, and not any details of the ship. Historian John Toland agreed in 1970 that &quot;Fusō&quot; had broken in two, but according to historian Anthony Tully in 2009:


&quot;Fusō&quot; sank between 03:38 and 03:50, releasing a large quantity of oil which ignited on the surface as she went down; only a few dozen men survived the rapid sinking and subsequent oil fire. There is evidence that some of these were rescued by the destroyer , which was itself sunk a short time later; it is also possible that some who escaped the sinking reached Leyte only to be killed by Filipinos, as is known to have happened to survivors from other Japanese warships sunk in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Ten crew members are known to have survived, all of whom returned to Japan. The total number of casualties is estimated at 1,620 sailors.

&quot;Fusō&quot; was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945.

====Wreck====

 discovered the wreck of &quot;Fusō&quot; on 25 November 2017. The ship lies upside down in of water and is in one piece on the seabed, with the hull broken amidships from the impact with the bottom. The pagoda mast broke off during the sinking and is some distance away from the wreck.

<text>Pinus fenzeliana commonly known as the Hainan white pine or Fenzel&#x27;s pine, is a tree endemic to the island of Hainan off southern China. This pine reaches heights of 20 m with a trunk 1 m in diameter.

==Description==
The leaves are needle-like, in fascicles of five, and 5–13 cm long. The seed cones are 6–11 cm long, with thick, woody scales; the seeds are large, about 8–15 mm long, with a vestigial 3 mm wing, similar to the related Chinese white pine (&quot;Pinus armandii&quot;). Hainan white pine differs from that species in the shorter needles, smaller cones, and in being adapted to a subtropical rainforest habitat.

A pine from the Dabie Mountains in Anhui, eastern China, first described as a species &quot;Pinus dabeshanensis&quot;, is occasionally treated as a variety of this species, but more commonly as a variety of &quot;P. armandii&quot;, which it more closely resembles.

Reports of &quot;Pinus fenzeliana&quot; from Vietnam have not been verified; trees in this area have proved to be either Vietnamese white pine (&quot;Pinus dalatensis&quot;) or Guangdong white pine (&quot;Pinus wangii&quot;), which both differ markedly in cone and seed size and shape, though similar in foliage.

<doc id="521212" wikidata="Q1066681" url="?curid=521212" title="Japanese battleship Haruna">
<text>was a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy during :World War I and :World War II. Designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston, she was the fourth and last battlecruiser of the , amongst the most heavily armed ships in any navy when built. Laid down in 1912 at the Kawasaki Shipyards in Kobe, &quot;Haruna&quot; was formally commissioned in 1915 on the same day as her sister ship, . &quot;Haruna&quot; patrolled off the Chinese coast during World War I. During gunnery drills in 1920, an explosion destroyed one of her guns, damaged the gun turret, and killed seven men.

During her career, &quot;Haruna&quot; underwent two major reconstructions. Beginning in 1926, the Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt her as a battleship, strengthening her armor and improving her speed and power capabilities. In 1933, her superstructure was completely rebuilt, her speed was increased, and she was equipped with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan&#x27;s growing carrier fleet, &quot;Haruna&quot; was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, &quot;Haruna&quot; transported Imperial Japanese Army troops to mainland China before being redeployed to the 3rd Battleship Division in 1941. On the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she sailed as part of the Southern Force in preparation for the Battle of Singapore.

&quot;Haruna&quot; fought in almost every major naval action of the Pacific Theater during World War II. She covered the Japanese landings in Malaya (in present-day Malaysia) and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in 1942 before engaging American forces at the Battle of Midway and during the Guadalcanal Campaign. Throughout 1943, &quot;Haruna&quot; primarily remained at Truk Lagoon (Micronesia), Kure Naval Base (near Hiroshima), Sasebo Naval Base (near Nagasaki), and the Lingga Islands (in present-day Indonesia), and deployed on several occasions in response to American carrier airstrikes on Japanese island bases. &quot;Haruna&quot; participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944, engaging American vessels in the latter.

In 1945, &quot;Haruna&quot; was transferred to Kure Naval Base, where she was sunk by aircraft of Task Force 38 on 28 July 1945.

== Design and construction ==

&quot;Haruna&quot; was the fourth and last of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers, a line of capital ships designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston. The class was ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of in 1908. The four battlecruiser s of the &quot;Kongō&quot; class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the other major powers at the time; they have been called the battlecruiser versions of the British (formerly Turkish) battleship . Their heavy armament and armor protection (which contributed 23.3 percent of their displacement) were greatly superior to those of any other Japanese capital ship afloat at the time.

The keel of &quot;Haruna&quot; was laid down at Kobe by Kawasaki on 16 March 1912, with most of the parts used in her construction manufactured in Japan. Due to a shortage of available slipways, &quot;Haruna&quot; and her sister ship were the first two capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy to be built in private shipyards. Launched on 14 December 1913, &quot;Haruna&quot;″s fitting-out began in early 1914. She was completed on 19 April 1915.

=== Armament ===

&quot;Haruna&quot;″s main battery consisted of eight heavy-caliber main guns in four twin turrets (two forward, two aft). The turrets were noted by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence to be &quot;similar to the British 15-inch turrets&quot;, with improvements made in flash-tightness. Each of her main guns could fire high-explosive or armor-piercing shells a maximum of at a firing rate of two shells per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;14/45&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the Japanese doctrine of deploying more powerful vessels before their opponents, &quot;Haruna&quot; and her sister ships were the first vessels in the world equipped with guns. The main guns carried ammunition for 90 salvoes, and had an approximate barrel life of 250 to 280 rounds. In 1941, separate dyes (used to distinguish between shells fired from multiple ships) were introduced for the armor-piercing shells of the four &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battleships, with &quot;Haruna&quot;″s armor-piercing shells using black dye.

Her secondary battery was originally sixteen 50-caliber medium guns in single casemates (all located amidships), eight guns and eight submerged torpedo tubes. The six-inch guns could fire five to six rounds per minute, with a barrel life of 500 rounds. The 6&quot;/50 caliber gun was capable of firing both anti-aircraft and anti-ship shells, though the positioning of the guns on &quot;Haruna&quot; made antiaircraft firing impractical. During her second reconstruction, the older 3-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight dual-purpose guns. These 5&quot;/40 caliber guns could fire between 8 and 14 rounds per minute, with a barrel life of 800 to 1,500 rounds. The 5&quot;/40 had the widest variety of shot types of &quot;Haruna&quot;″s guns, being designed to fire antiaircraft, antiship, and illumination shells. She was also armed with a large number of antiaircraft machine guns. In 1943, her secondary armament was reconfigured to eight guns, twelve guns, and finally by the end of 1944 one hundred and eight Type 96 antiaircraft autocannon in 30 triple and 18 single mounts.

== Operational history ==

=== 1915–1926: Battlecruiser ===
On 19 April 1915, &quot;Haruna&quot; was formally commissioned at Kobe. On 13 December 1915, after eight months of trials, she was assigned to the 3rd Battleship Division of the 2nd Fleet. On 9 April 1916, she departed Sasebo Naval Base for operations in the East China Sea, returning to Japan 10 days later. On 1 December 1916, Captain Saburo Hyakutake assumed command of &quot;Haruna&quot; until 15 September 1917, when Captain Naomi Taniguchi replaced him. On 1 December 1917, she was placed in reserve, as hostilities in the Pacific theatre of World War I concluded.

On 12 September 1920, &quot;Haruna&quot; was involved in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No. 1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.

With the conclusion of World War I and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty, the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy was significantly lessened, with a ratio of 5:5:3 required between the capital ships of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. The treaty also banned Japan from building any new capital ships until 1931, with no capital ship permitted to exceed . Provided that new additions did not exceed , existing capital ships were allowed to be upgraded with improved anti-torpedo bulges and deck armor. By the time the Washington Treaty had been fully implemented in Japan, only three classes of World War I-era capital ships remained active: the s, the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers, and one of the s ().

=== 1926–1933: Reconstruction into battleship ===

Unable to construct new capital ships until 1931, Japan resorted to upgrading battleships and battlecruisers. In July 1926, &quot;Haruna&quot; became the first of Japan&#x27;s vessels to undergo extensive modernization and modification, in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Over the next two years, her horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened, and the machinery spaces within the hull were increased. Anti-torpedo bulges were added along the waterline, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. She was refitted to accommodate three Type 90 Model 0 floatplanes. To increase her speed and power capacities, all 36 Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with 16 newer boilers, and Brown-Curtis direct-drive turbines were installed. &quot;Haruna&quot;″s forward funnel was removed, and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened. The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6,502 to 10,313 long tons, directly violating the terms of the Washington Treaty. In July 1928, &quot;Haruna&quot;—now capable of speeds of —was reclassified as a battleship.

Following new sea trials, &quot;Haruna&quot; was assigned on 10 December 1928 to the 4th Battleship Division of the 2nd Fleet as the Emperor&#x27;s special ship. For the next 12 months, she operated between Sasebo, Port Arthur, and the East China Sea. On 1 February 1929, Prince Takamatsu, the younger brother of Emperor Hirohito, was assigned to the crew. On 20 November 1929, she was reassigned to the 1st Battleship Division. She was placed in reserve on 1 December 1930.
On 22 April 1930, Japan signed the London Naval Treaty, placing further restrictions on its maritime forces. In addition to the scrapping of several older battleships, Japan would not be permitted to construct new capital ships until 1937. After minor fitting-out work, her reconstruction begun in 1926 was declared complete on 1 October 1931. On 8 November 1931, she served as the Emperor&#x27;s ship during his official visit to Kumamoto prefecture.

In September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. On 25 February 1933, based on the report by the Lytton Commission, the League of Nations agreed that Japan&#x27;s invasion had violated Chinese sovereignty. Refusing to accept the organization&#x27;s judgment, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations the same day. By the end of 1934, Japan would also announce that it would withdraw from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, thus removing all restrictions on the number and size of its capital ships.

=== 1933–1941: Fast battleship ===
&quot;Haruna&quot; was reactivated and assigned to the 1st Battleship Division on 20 May 1933. However, on 1 August 1933, &quot;Haruna&quot; was drydocked at Kure Naval Arsenal in preparation for upgrades that would enable her to escort Japan&#x27;s growing fleet of aircraft carriers. Her stern was lengthened by , and her bridge was completely reconstructed according to Japan&#x27;s pagoda mast style of forward superstructure. Her 16 older boilers were removed and replaced with 11 oil-fired Kampon Boilers and newer geared turbines. Catapults and rails were added to support three Nakajima E8N or Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance and spotter floatplanes.

&quot;Haruna&quot;″s armor was also extensively upgraded. Her main belt was strengthened to a uniform thickness of 8 inches (up from varying thicknesses of 6 to 8 inches), while diagonal bulkheads of depths ranging from now reinforced the main armored belt. The turret armor was strengthened to , while were added to portions of the deck armor. Her ammunition magazine protection was also strengthened to . The reconstruction was finished on 30 September 1934. Capable of more than despite the significant increase in hull displacement, &quot;Haruna&quot; was now reclassified as a fast battleship.

On 28 October 1935, Captain Jisaburō Ozawa assumed command of &quot;Haruna&quot;. On 1 June 1936, she was assigned to the 3rd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet. Throughout 1937, &quot;Haruna&quot; conducted extensive gunnery drills and patrols off the coast of China, primarily in the vicinity of Qingdao. On 7 July 1937, Japan officially declared war on China, thus beginning the Sino-Japanese War. One month later, &quot;Haruna&quot; transported Japanese Army forces to mainland China in preparation for campaigns into Chinese Nationalist territory. On 1 December 1937, she was again placed in reserve. On 2 April 1940, she was transferred from Sasebo to Taiwan. She was redesignated as a &quot;special service ship&quot; on 15 November 1940, and five months later was attached to the 3rd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet, based in Hashirajima.

=== 1941–1942: Early war service ===
&quot;Haruna&quot; and &quot;Kongō&quot; departed the Hashirajima fleet anchorage on 29 November 1941, to participate in the opening stage of the Pacific War as part of the Southern (Malay) Force&#x27;s Main Body, under the overall command of Vice-Admiral Nobutake Kondō. On 4 December 1941, the Main Body arrived off the coast of Southern Siam and Northern Malaya, in preparation for the invasion of Siam and the Malayan Peninsula four days later. When Britain&#x27;s &quot;Force Z&quot;—consisting of the battleship and the battlecruiser —was quickly defeated by Japan&#x27;s land-based and carrier aircraft, &quot;Haruna&quot;″s battlegroup withdrew from Malayan waters. The battlegroup subsequently sortied from Indochina for three days in mid-December to protect a reinforcement convoy traveling to Malaya and again on 18 December to cover the Army&#x27;s landing at Lingayen Gulf in the Philippines. The Main Body departed Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 23 December bound for Taiwan, arriving two days later.

On 11 December 1941, an erroneous report was published in the U.S. media that an American B-17 heavy bomber had bombed and mortally damaged &quot;Haruna&quot; during battle off Lingayen Gulf off the Philippines. No Japanese battleships were present, and &quot;Haruna&quot; was away in the Gulf of Siam at the time.

On 18 January 1942, Kondō&#x27;s Main Force arrived in Palau alongside two fast carriers, with the intention of covering Japan&#x27;s invasion of Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. &quot;Haruna&quot;, , and the fleet carriers and operated to the east of Mindanao until 18 February 1942, when the Main Body departed Palau in preparation for &quot;Operation J&quot;, Japan&#x27;s invasion of the Dutch East Indies. On 25 February, the 3rd Battleship Division provided cover for air attacks on Java. &quot;Haruna&quot; bombarded Christmas Island on 7 March 1942, then returned to Staring-baai for 15 days of maintenance and rest. In April 1942, &quot;Haruna&quot; joined five fleet carriers in attacks on Colombo in Ceylon. Following the destruction of on 5 April 1942, &quot;Haruna&quot; was sent southwest to locate the remainder of the British Eastern Fleet, under the command of Admiral James Somerville. On 9 April, one of her floatplanes spotted the carrier south of Trincomalee; Japanese airstrikes sank the carrier the same day. Having crippled the offensive capability of Britain&#x27;s Eastern Fleet, the 3rd Battleship Division returned to Japan on 23 April. &quot;Haruna&quot; was drydocked throughout May 1942 for general repairs and refits.

On 29 May 1942, &quot;Haruna&quot; joined her sister ship as part of Vice-Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s carrier strike force during the Battle of Midway. On 4 June, she was attacked in multiple airstrikes by American torpedo bombers, but she took no hits and succeeded in shooting down five American aircraft. On 5 June, she took on survivors from the four destroyed Japanese aircraft carriers before returning to Japan. She remained in Japan until September 1942, undergoing minor refits in August of that year. On 6 September, &quot;Haruna&quot; transferred to Truk Lagoon alongside the rest of the 3rd Battleship Division, and on 10 September the ship sortied as part of Admiral Kondō&#x27;s 2nd Fleet into the Solomon Islands. On 20 September, the fleet was ordered to return to Truk.

=== Bombardment of Henderson Field ===
In the aftermath of the Battle of Cape Esperance, the Japanese Army opted to reinforce their positions on Guadalcanal. To protect their transport convoy from enemy air attack, Admiral Yamamoto sent &quot;Haruna&quot; and &quot;Kongō&quot;, escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, to bombard Henderson Field. Because of their high speed, the two battleships could bombard the field and withdraw before being subjected to air attack from aircraft carriers. On the night of 13–14 October, the two battleships shelled Henderson Field from a distance of , firing 973 14-inch shells. In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war, the bombardment heavily damaged both runways, destroyed almost all available aviation fuel, incapacitated 48 of the airfield&#x27;s 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men. The Japanese troop convoy reached the island the next day.

During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, &quot;Haruna&quot; was attacked by a PBY Catalina flying boat but received no damage. In mid-November, the battleship and other warships provided distant cover for the ultimately unsuccessful efforts to bombard Henderson Field again and land reinforcements on Guadalcanal. On 15 November 1942, following the Japanese defeat and loss of and during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the 3rd Battleship Division returned to Truk, where it remained for the rest of 1942.

=== 1943: Movement between bases ===
&quot;Haruna&quot; engaged no enemy targets during 1943. In late January 1943, she participated in &quot;Operation Ke&quot;, as part of a diversionary force and distant cover supporting Japanese destroyers that were evacuating personnel from Guadalcanal. During 15–20 February 1943, the 3rd Battleship Division transferred from Truk to Kure Naval Base. From 23 February to 31 March 1943, &quot;Haruna&quot; was drydocked in Kure Naval Arsenal for upgrades, receiving additional Type 96 antiaircraft guns and armor. On 17 May 1943, in response to the American invasion of Attu Island, &quot;Haruna&quot; sortied alongside , the 3rd Battleship Division, two fleet carriers, two cruisers and nine destroyers. Three days later, the submarine discovered the task group, but was unable to attack. On 22 May 1943, the task force arrived in Yokosuka, where it was joined by an additional three fleet carriers and two light cruisers; the force was disbanded when Attu fell before the necessary preparations were finished. Throughout June 1943, &quot;Haruna&quot; was refitted at Yokosuka. On 18 September 1943, &quot;Haruna&quot; left Truk as part of a counterattack force in response to American raids on the Brown Islands in Micronesia, but no contact was made and the ship returned to the base.

On 17 October 1943, &quot;Haruna&quot; again left Truk as part of an even larger force—five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and numerous destroyers—in response to American raids on Wake Island. When no contact was made the force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. On 16 December 1943, she arrived at Sasebo for refits and inland-sea training.

=== 1944: Final combat actions ===
On 25 January 1944, Captain Kazu Shigenaga assumed command of &quot;Haruna&quot; while the ship was stationed at Kure. The 3rd Battleship Division departed Kure on 8 March 1944. Arriving at Lingga on 14 March 1944, the division remained for training until 11 May 1944. On 11 May 1944, &quot;Haruna&quot; and Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet departed Lingga for Tawi-Tawi, where they were joined by Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s &quot;Force C&quot;. On 13 June, Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet departed Tawitawi for the Mariana Islands. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Haruna&quot; escorted Japanese fast carriers, and was hit by two armor-piercing bombs on 20 June 1944 from U.S. carrier aircraft. On 24 June, she was drydocked in Kure for repairs and refitting. In August 1944 she transferred to Lingga.

=== Battle of Leyte Gulf ===

In October 1944, &quot;Haruna&quot; departed Lingga in preparation for &quot;Operation Sho-1&quot;, Japan&#x27;s counterattack during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval engagement in history, as part of Admiral Takao Kurita&#x27;s center force, consisting of herself and her sister ship , the battleship , and the &quot;super battleships&quot; and , the largest and most powerful battleships ever built, supported by ten heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and fifteen destroyers. The plan immediately had its hiccups. On the 23rd, the submarine sank the heavy cruiser , followed by the submarine torpedoing and sinking the heavy cruiser , then &quot;Darter&quot; crippled the heavy cruiser , forcing her out of the battle alongside two destroyers to escort her. The next day, air attacks from US aircraft carriers persisted. &quot;Haruna&quot; survived with only minor damage from bomb splinters, but &quot;Musashi&quot; was sunk and the heavy cruiser was crippled and forced out of the battle alongside two more destroyers to escort her.

==== Battle off Samar ====

A false retreat tricked the US into believing the Japanese center force was well out of the battle, leading to Admiral Halsey chasing Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s decoy force. On the 25th, the diminished center force located Taffy 3, a small US task force of six escort carriers, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts, prompting &quot;Haruna&quot; to fire away. She initially targeted the destroyer with her 6-inch (152 mm) secondary guns, but missed her shots before reengaging the escort carriers. At 7:54, &quot;Haruna&quot; hit the escort carrier with a 14-inch (356 mm) shell to her hangar bay from a distance of 16,400 yards (15,000 meters), disabling her aircraft elevator. &quot;Haruna&quot; was then targeted by destroyer-launched torpedoes, but they all missed. At 8:10, &quot;Haruna&quot; (probably) hit the escort carrier with a 14-inch (356 mm) shell to her stern, causing negligible damage, as almost simultaneously &quot;Yamato&quot; hit her with an 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell that punched through her hangar bay. &quot;Haruna&quot; failed to hit &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; again as &quot;Yamato&quot; caused the majority of the fatal damage which sank the flat top.

After a fierce defensive action by the American ships, Admiral Kurita elected to withdraw, ending the battle.

Following the Japanese Navy&#x27;s defeat at Leyte Gulf, &quot;Haruna&quot; returned to Brunei and Lingga for repairs. On 22 November 1944, she ran aground on a coral reef near Lingga, suffering serious damage to her watertight compartments and forcing her to return to Sasebo, where the hull was patched and repaired. On 2 December 1944, while returning to Japan from Southeast Asia as part of a task group, she evaded torpedoes fired by an American submarine. On 9 December, three more American submarines—, , and —intercepted the task group and they proceeded to permanently cripple the aircraft carrier with three torpedo hits. Unharmed, &quot;Haruna&quot; arrived at Sasebo the following day. At the end of 1944, she transferred to Kure for full repairs and upgrading, having survived a year in which four other Japanese battleships had been lost.

=== 1945: Loss ===
On 1 January 1945, &quot;Haruna&quot; was removed from the deactivated 3rd Battleship Division and transferred to the 1st Battleship Division of the 2nd Fleet. On 10 February, &quot;Haruna&quot; was assigned to the Kure Naval District. On 19 March 1945, American carrier aircraft attacked the remainder of the Japanese Navy at Kure. The base was defended by veteran Japanese fighter instructors flying Kawanishi N1K-J &quot;Shiden&quot; or &quot;George&quot; fighters, led by the man who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, Minoru Genda. These fighter planes were superior in some respects to America&#x27;s main fighter, the F6F Hellcat. They surprised the attackers, destroyed several American aircraft, and defended the base from the brunt of the attack. &quot;Haruna&quot; sustained light damage from a single bomb on the starboard side, and remained at Kure.

On 24 July 1945, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Task Force 38 began a series of aerial attacks on Kure Naval Base to destroy the last remnants of Japan&#x27;s navy. The same day, the battleship was sunk, and &quot;Haruna&quot; was hit by a single bomb which caused light damage. Four days later, she sustained eight bomb hits from Task Force 38&#x27;s aircraft and sank at her moorings at 16:15. In two days of attacks, 65 officers and men of &quot;Haruna&quot; were killed. Her remnants were raised from the sea floor in 1946 and broken up over the course of two months.

<text>Pinus clausa is a species of pine endemic to the Southeastern United States. Its common names include sand pine, Florida spruce pine, and scrub pine.

==Distribution==
The tree is found in two separate locations, one across central peninsular Florida, and the other along the western Florida panhandle coast into the Alabama coast. There is a range gap of about between the populations (from the Ochlockonee River to Cedar Key). The sand pines of the Florida peninsula and of the Florida panhandle coast differ enough to be classified into two varieties or races, &quot;Pinus clausa&quot; var. &quot;clausa&quot; (&quot;Ocala&quot;), on the peninsula, and &quot;P. clausa&quot; var. &quot;immuginata&quot; (&quot;Choctawhatchee&quot;), along the panhandle coast. While most peninsular sand pines (var. &quot;clausa&quot;) have non-serotinous, or open, cones, most of the panhandle sand pines (var. &quot;immuginata&quot;) have serotinous, or closed, cones.

Sand pine is largely confined to the very infertile, excessively well-drained, sandy habitat of Florida scrub. It is often the only canopy tree in the Florida scrub ecosystem. Stands of sand pines in peninsular Florida tend to be dense and of the same age, while stands of sand pines along the panhandle coast tend to be more open than on the peninsula, and with trees of varying age.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus clausa&quot; is a small, often shrubby tree from , exceptionally to tall. It is vulnerable to windfall, and stands in areas prone to hurricanes can be found leaning in the same direction.

The leaves are needle-like, in pairs, long, and its cones are long.

Over much of its range, it is fire-adapted to stand-replacing wildfires, with the cones remaining closed for many years (&quot;clausa&quot; = closed), until a natural forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones. These then reseed the burnt ground. Some populations differ in having cones that open at maturity, with seed dispersal not relying on fires. Without a fire every 20-60 years, Pinus clausa populations will be succeeded by oak and hickory. Most fires occur in the spring due to low water content in the needles and high winds. In addition, resin content is highest in the spring, causing extreme or uncontrollable fire behavior, such as a 1935 fire in Ocala National Forest that burned 5,670 acres (2,295 ha) in only 4 hours.
==Uses==
&quot;Pinus clausa&quot; woodlands are an important part of the Florida scrub ecosystem, and provide habitat for songbirds, birds of prey, grey and flying squirrels, as well as the endangered Florida sand skink and Florida scrub jay, among other species. It is one of the few canopy trees able to grow in arid, sandy, and hot locations with minimal care.

While the dense branching and crooked trunks makes this tree unsuitable for wood production, it is often used for wood pulp.

<doc id="521215" wikidata="Q2757805" url="?curid=521215" title="Bazooka (instrument)">
<text>The bazooka is a brass musical instrument several feet in length which incorporates telescopic tubing like the trombone. Radio comedian Bob Burns is credited with inventing the instrument in the 1910s, and popularized it in the 1930s. It was also played by jazz musicians Noon Johnson and Sanford Kendrick.

==Name==
The name &quot;bazooka&quot; comes from an extension of the word &quot;bazoo&quot;, which is slang for &quot;mouth&quot; or &quot;boastful talk&quot;, and which ultimately probably stems from Dutch &quot;bazuin&quot; (buisine, a medieval trumpet). The name appears in the 1909 novel &quot;The Swoop, or How Clarence Saved England&quot; by P. G. Wodehouse.

During World War II, the United States Army&#x27;s new M1 anti-tank weapon, a man-portable recoilless anti-tank rocket launcher, rapidly became universally known by its nickname the &quot;bazooka&quot; because of its resemblance to this musical instrument.

==Instrument==

From its start within a lipreed mouthpiece – which may consist of nothing but the bare tube or may employ a mouthpiece which is handmade to emulate one from a low brass instrument – the air column expands into a length of large-diameter pipe that slides freely around a length of narrower-diameter pipe, which, in turn, terminates in a widely flaring bell.

Although the slide action of the bazooka appears as if it would alter the pitch in the same way as the slide of a trombone, this is not the case, due to the extremely wide diameter of the bazooka&#x27;s tubing relative to its length. Manipulating the horn&#x27;s length changes only the tone quality, as subtle harmonic overtones fluctuate. This effect gives the bazooka its characteristic warbling, echoing sound.

All of the bazooka&#x27;s notes are produced purely in falset. In other words, the player&#x27;s lips produce pitches as they vibrate on the bare pipe end (or on the optional mouthpiece and leadpipe unit), but the pitches produced by the lips cannot generate a standing-wave vibration of the air inside such a wide tube. Therefore, unlike the trombone, the remainder of the bazooka works mainly as a megaphone to amplify the volume of the sound.

It can be seen being played by Bob Burns in the 1936 movie &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; during the song &quot;I&#x27;m an Old Cowhand&quot;.

<text>The Thumb Fire took place on September 5, 1881, in the Thumb area of Michigan in the United States. The fire, which burned over a million acres (4,000 km2) in less than a day, was the consequence of drought, hurricane-force winds, heat, the after-effects of the Port Huron Fire of 1871, and the ecological damage wrought by the era&#x27;s logging techniques. The blaze, also called the Great Thumb Fire, the Great Forest Fire of 1881 and the Huron Fire, killed 282 people in Sanilac, Lapeer, Tuscola and Huron counties. The damage estimate was $2,347,000 in 1881, equivalent to $ when adjusted for inflation. The fire sent enough soot and ash up into the atmosphere that sunlight was partially obscured at many locations on the East Coast of the United States. In New England cities, the sky appeared yellow and projected a strange luminosity onto buildings and vegetation. Twilight appeared at 12 noon. September 6, 1881, became known as &quot;Yellow Tuesday&quot; or &quot;Yellow Day&quot; because of the ominous nature of this atmospheric event.

==History==
August and the first days of September 1881 were hotter than usual, and the Thumb had had a rain deficit since April; in Thornville, this period was the driest registered up to 1969. There were forest fires beginning in mid-August, and on August 31, a fire started in northern Lapeer County. It destroyed several buildings in Sandusky and Deckerville in nearby Sanilac County. On Monday, September 5, the town of Bad Axe, in Huron County, burst into flames. Winds spread the fire to Huron City and Grindstone City. The fire continued to spread through Tuesday and Wednesday, September 6 and 7, consuming most of Huron, Tuscola, Sanilac and Lapeer counties.

==Relief aid==

In 1881 Clara Barton, at the age of 60, founded the American Red Cross. The organization&#x27;s first official disaster relief operation was its response to the Michigan &quot;Thumb Fire&quot; of 1881. The Red Cross provided money, clothes and household items. The fire caused more than 14,000 people to be dependent on public aid. It also destroyed over 2,000 barns, dwellings, and schools.

==Fire protection==
After the fires of 1881, people started to organize firefighting plans. By the 1900s the timber barons were suffering huge losses from forest fires, so they developed the Northern Forest and Protection Association to manage forest fires in Michigan; it was superseded by the U.S. Forest Service. However, the Ford Motor Company, which owned large areas of forest, had already established serious conservation and cleanup methods, along with maintaining their own firetowers and timber patrols, in order to discover fires soon after their start. The early settlers used bucket brigades to protect their houses and barns, but they were no match for the raging fires. In 1917, Michigan purchased its first tractor for firefighting.

<text>Bazooka is an American brand of bubble gum that was introduced in 1947. It is a product of &quot;Bazooka Candy Brands&quot; (BCB), which was a division of The Topps Co. until the latter’s acquisition by Fanatics, Inc. in 2022.

In October 2023, it was announced that Apax Partners had completed the acquisition of BCB and its product portfolio.

== History ==
Bazooka bubble gum was first marketed shortly after World War II in the U.S. by the Topps Company of Brooklyn, New York. The gum was most likely named after the rocket-propelled weapon developed by the U.S. army during the war, which itself was named after a musical instrument.

The bubble gum was packaged in a red, white, and blue color scheme and originally sold for 1 penny. Beginning in 1953, Topps changed the packaging to include small comic strips with the gum, featuring the character &quot;Bazooka Joe&quot;. There are over 1,535 different &quot;Bazooka Joe&quot; comic-strip wrappers to collect. Also on the comic strip is an offer for a premium and a fortune. Older Bazooka Joe comic strips were larger in size and are no longer available.
In addition to &quot;Original&quot;, Topps eventually included the flavors &quot;Strawberry Shake,&quot; &quot;Cherry Berry,&quot; &quot;Watermelon Whirl,&quot; and &quot;Grape Rage.&quot; Bazooka bubble gum also makes sugar-free flavors such as &quot;Original&quot; and a &quot;Flavor Blasts&quot; variety, claimed to have a longer-lasting, more intense taste. Bazooka bubble gum comes in two different sizes.

Bazooka bubble gum is sold in many countries, often with Bazooka Joe comic strips translated to the local language. Bazooka gum is sold in Canada with cartoons in both English and French, depending upon the city. In Israel, it is manufactured under license by Elite in the company&#x27;s factory in Nof HaGalil; the cartoons are written in Hebrew.

In Spain, it was sold under the name &quot;Chicle Bazoka&quot; (with only one &quot;o&quot;) starting in the mid-1960s and featuring the Bazooka Joe strips. One of the publicity slogans was &quot;Chicle bazoka, siempre en la boca&quot; (Bazooka gum, always in the mouth). Rhymes were a popular publicity trick at the time.

In 2012, Bazooka Candy Brands announced they would no longer include comics, instead using brain-teasing puzzle wrappers in an attempt to modernize the brand.

In Argentina, sales continue with the comics in Spanish using the name &quot;Yo amo Bazooka&quot; (I love Bazooka). Topps lists all information about all of its Bazooka Candy brands through its website Candymania.

In April 2019, the company announced the launch of the Bazooka Throwback pack.
